## Question

UTI

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about urinary tract infection (UTI) management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to classify the UTI syndrome and patient risk. Then, I should verify the diagnostic approach, including when to culture and how to interpret results. Next, I will consider empiric therapy choices, durations, and stewardship. After that, I should review definitive therapy and follow-up, including test-of-cure. Finally, I will examine special populations, prevention strategies, and emerging diagnostics and therapeutics, making sure each step aligns with current guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the clinical classification because everything downstream depends on it; uncomplicated UTI typically refers to acute cystitis in nonpregnant, immunocompetent women without structural or functional urinary abnormalities, whereas complicated UTI includes infections in men, patients with catheters, obstruction, immunocompromise, or systemic illness, and acute pyelonephritis represents upper tract involvement with systemic features, so I need to ensure I anchor on these definitions before proceeding [^113Ym5hA] [^114JeXVq].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic approach for uncomplicated cystitis; in women with classic symptoms (dysuria, frequency, urgency, suprapubic pain) and no vaginal discharge, a clinical diagnosis is acceptable without culture, but I should double-check that this remains supported by contemporary guidance and stewardship frameworks, which it does, while also noting that culture is warranted for atypical presentations, treatment failure, recurrent infections, or suspected resistance risks [^1132xnmk] [^114hHBBu].

> Hold on, I should verify when to obtain cultures and how to interpret them; for complicated UTI, pyelonephritis, recurrent infections, or suspected resistance, obtaining a urinalysis and urine culture with susceptibilities before antibiotics is recommended, and I need to ensure I de-escalate to a narrower agent once results return, ideally within 48–72 hours, to support antimicrobial stewardship and reduce collateral damage [^112bPvv4] [^112gtP1T].

> I will now examine empiric therapy for uncomplicated cystitis; first-line options include nitrofurantoin 5 days, fosfomycin single dose, TMP-SMX 3 days if local resistance is under 20%, or trimethoprim 3 days, and I should confirm that fluoroquinolones are not preferred due to resistance and adverse effects, reserving them for alternatives when first-line agents are unsuitable or resistance patterns dictate, which aligns with guideline-concordant care and recent machine-learning corroboration of superior outcomes with guideline-concordant choices [^1132xnmk] [^114FurQs].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought β-lactams were broadly inferior for uncomplicated cystitis; let me reconsider and be precise — older comparative data show β-lactams can achieve symptomatic cure but have lower bacteriologic cure and more adverse effects than some comparators, so while they are not first-line for uncomplicated cystitis, they remain reasonable alternatives when first-line agents are contraindicated or resistance patterns favor them, which I should explicitly state to avoid overgeneralization [^114PmJ6k] [^1132xnmk].

> Next, I should review duration for uncomplicated cystitis; 3 days for TMP-SMX or TMP, 5 days for nitrofurantoin, and single-dose fosfomycin are standard, and I need to ensure I emphasize that longer courses increase adverse effects without improving outcomes, reinforcing stewardship principles [^1132xnmk] [^114R1CdB].

> Let me think about antimicrobial stewardship in uncomplicated UTI; delayed prescribing or watchful waiting can be appropriate for patients with mild symptoms willing to defer antibiotics, and I should confirm that this strategy reduces unnecessary antibiotic use without compromising safety in carefully selected patients, which is supported by randomized and pragmatic studies [^111osZb9] [^115qQwRP].

> I should confirm empiric therapy for complicated UTI and pyelonephritis; oral fluoroquinolones or TMP-SMX are options if local resistance is low, otherwise an oral β-lactam such as amoxicillin-clavulanate or a cephalosporin is reasonable, with parenteral therapy reserved for severe illness or inability to tolerate oral agents, and I need to ensure I tailor to local antibiograms and patient-specific risk factors for resistance [^1153oX8h].

> Hold on, I should verify duration for complicated UTI; for clinically improving patients, shorter courses are favored: 5–7 days for fluoroquinolones or 7 days for non-fluoroquinolone agents, and for Gram-negative bacteremia, 7 days is reasonable if improving, which represents a shift from historical 10–14 day paradigms and should be applied with attention to exclusions such as indwelling catheters or severe sepsis [^117Smpys] [^116fXk2s].

> I need to check the IV-to-oral transition; once patients are clinically improving, afebrile, hemodynamically stable, and an effective oral option exists, switching to oral therapy to complete the course is recommended, which reduces costs and complications without sacrificing outcomes [^112BXcnZ].

> Next, I should review definitive therapy; as soon as culture and susceptibilities return, I should de-escalate to the narrowest effective agent and adjust duration accordingly, and I should double-check that this principle is emphasized across cUTI guidance, which it is [^112bPvv4] [^112gtP1T].

> But wait, what about test-of-cure; for uncomplicated cystitis in women, routine test-of-cure is not needed if symptoms resolve, whereas in complicated UTI, persistent or recurrent symptoms, or infections in high-risk hosts, warrant repeat culture and evaluation for obstruction, abscess, or other source control issues, so I should tailor follow-up testing to the clinical context [^117Smpys].

> Let me consider special populations; in pregnancy, I should treat even asymptomatic bacteriuria and avoid fluoroquinolones, using beta-lactams or nitrofurantoin when appropriate, and in children, I should confirm diagnosis with culture, use ultrasound rather than routine VCUG after a first febrile UTI, and individualize duration with emerging evidence supporting shorter courses when clinically improved, which balances efficacy and stewardship [^113QNgjh] [^117EeSio] [^112amWAz].

> I should double-check management in older adults; distinguishing symptomatic UTI from asymptomatic bacteriuria is critical, and I must avoid treating ASB outside pregnancy because it does not improve outcomes and increases adverse events, so I should apply structured diagnostic criteria and avoid reflex antibiotics in the absence of localized urinary symptoms [^11183VFt] [^112HusbM].

> For recurrent UTI, I need to ensure I define it correctly as at least 2 culture-proven infections in 6 months or 3 in 12 months, and then consider continuous prophylaxis, postcoital therapy, or patient-initiated therapy, while also discussing nonantibiotic options such as vaginal estrogen in postmenopausal women and methenamine, and I should confirm that shared decision-making is emphasized given trade-offs and patient preferences [^114AqSwd] [^113AFvAL].

> Hold on, I should verify prevention strategies; behavioral measures, adequate hydration, and evidence-informed nonantibiotic options like methenamine can reduce recurrences, and while cranberry products have modest benefit in some trials, they should not replace antibiotics for treatment, which I need to make clear to avoid misinterpretation [^1132xnmk] [^111DGJZF].

> Next, I should review emerging diagnostics; molecular testing and enhanced urinalysis platforms may shorten time-to-result and reduce unnecessary antibiotics, but I need to emphasize that evidence remains preliminary and guideline bodies caution that more high-quality data are needed before routine adoption, so I should position these as adjuncts rather than replacements for clinical judgment [^116Lq8ka] [^1174T2WE].

> I will now examine emerging therapeutics; antimicrobial peptides, anti-virulence agents, and bacteriophage therapy are promising avenues to mitigate resistance, but I should confirm that most are investigational and not yet standard of care, reserving them for research settings or carefully selected refractory cases under specialist oversight [^113w9t1z] [^113Sj4KX].

> Finally, I need to ensure my approach aligns with stewardship and local epidemiology; using the narrowest effective agent, the shortest effective duration, and de-escalating based on cultures reduces resistance and adverse events, and I should regularly consult local antibiograms to guide empiric choices and adjust as resistance patterns evolve, which is a cornerstone of modern UTI management [^113w9t1z] [^115tHio8].

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common bacterial infections of the urinary system, most often caused by **E. coli** [^116tjdf4] [^116j5Mhf]. Diagnosis relies on **symptoms plus urinalysis/culture** [^1132xnmk] [^114hHBBu]; in uncomplicated cases, a clinical diagnosis is often sufficient [^1132xnmk]. First-line treatment is **short-course nitrofurantoin, TMP-SMX, or fosfomycin** [^1132xnmk] [^112e6Ry3], with therapy tailored to local resistance and patient factors [^114PmJ6k]. Complicated UTIs need longer courses and culture-guided therapy [^112bPvv4]. Prevention includes hydration, hygiene, and cranberry; **antibiotic prophylaxis is reserved for recurrent UTIs** [^114AqSwd] [^1132xnmk]. Rising resistance [^115rRycJ] and recurrence [^115tHio8] are ongoing challenges; **stewardship and individualized care** are essential [^113w9t1z] [^114hHBBu].

---

## Etiology and pathogenesis

- **Common pathogens**: E. coli causes ~80% of uncomplicated UTIs [^notfound]; other Gram-negatives (Klebsiella, Proteus, Pseudomonas) and Gram-positives (Enterococcus, Staphylococcus) are more frequent in complicated disease [^1126ST1b].

- **Virulence factors**: Adhesins (FimH), toxins, and biofilm formation enable colonization, invasion, and immune evasion [^notfound].

- **Host factors**: Female sex, sexual activity, menopause, diabetes, immunosuppression, and urinary obstruction increase risk [^116j5Mhf] [^114AzavG].

---

## Clinical presentation

UTIs present with **characteristic symptoms** and signs that guide diagnosis and management [^1132xnmk].

| **Clinical syndrome** | **Typical symptoms** | **Systemic signs** |
|-|-|-|
| Uncomplicated cystitis | - Dysuria <br/> - Frequency <br/> - Urgency <br/> - Suprapubic pain | Absent |
| Complicated UTI | - Flank pain <br/> - Fever <br/> - Chills <br/> - Nausea <br/> - Vomiting | Present |
| Asymptomatic bacteriuria | No symptoms | Absent |

---

## Diagnostic methods

- **Clinical diagnosis**: Typical symptoms in nonpregnant women are often sufficient for uncomplicated cystitis [^1132xnmk] [^1142cqa9].

- **Urinalysis**: Pyuria and bacteriuria support diagnosis; leukocyte esterase and nitrite are useful screens [^1174T2WE] [^117EeSio].

- **Urine culture**: Gold standard; ≥ 10⁵ CFU/mL of a single organism in a clean-catch specimen confirms infection [^117EeSio].

- **Imaging**: Reserved for complicated UTIs, recurrent infections, or treatment failure to detect obstruction, abscess, or structural abnormalities [^111Gwyks] [^117W3So1].

---

## Treatment strategies

Treatment depends on **severity, patient factors, and local resistance** [^115e9Bwk].

---

### Uncomplicated cystitis

- **First-line antibiotics**: Nitrofurantoin 5 days, TMP-SMX 3 days, or fosfomycin single dose [^1132xnmk] [^114R1CdB].

- **Alternative agents**: Beta-lactams (amoxicillin-clavulanate, cefpodoxime) if first-line agents are unsuitable [^112e6Ry3] [^114PmJ6k].

- **Fluoroquinolones**: Reserved for resistance or intolerance due to collateral damage and resistance risk [^112e6Ry3].

---

### Complicated UTI

Complicated UTI requires **longer therapy** — typically 7–14 days — guided by culture and susceptibility results [^117Smpys] [^112bPvv4]. Initial parenteral therapy is indicated for severe illness or sepsis, with a switch to oral agents once stable [^112BXcnZ]. Source control of obstruction, catheters, or abscesses is essential to eradicate infection [^114JeXVq].

---

### Recurrent UTIs

Continuous prophylaxis with low-dose antibiotics reduces recurrence [^1142cqa9] [^1132xnmk]; **postcoital prophylaxis** is effective for women with sexual triggers, and **nonantibiotic options** such as vaginal estrogen, methenamine, and D-mannose are alternatives [^114AqSwd] [^115mVcrU].

---

## Prevention

Prevention focuses on **behavioral and nonantibiotic measures**, with antibiotics reserved for select cases [^1132xnmk].

- **Behavioral measures**: Adequate hydration, frequent voiding, postcoital voiding, and hygiene [^1132xnmk].

- **Cranberry products**: Modest benefit in reducing recurrence [^1132xnmk].

- **Antibiotic prophylaxis**: For frequent, disabling recurrences despite nonantibiotic measures [^1132xnmk].

---

## Emerging trends and challenges

- **Antibiotic resistance**: Rising ESBL and carbapenemase producers limit options and demand stewardship [^115H9zXq] [^113w9t1z].

- **Recurrence**: Intracellular reservoirs and biofilms drive persistence and relapse [^113Sj4KX].

- **Diagnostics**: Rapid molecular tests may enable faster, more accurate detection and resistance profiling [^116Lq8ka].

- **Nonantibiotic therapies**: Vaccines, bacteriophages, and anti-virulence agents are under investigation [^113w9t1z] [^113Sj4KX].

---

UTIs are common and often treatable, but **resistance and recurrence require vigilant stewardship and individualized care** [^113w9t1z].

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a common source of morbidity and require significant health care resources for diagnosis, treatment, and prevention. Antimicrobials represent the mainstay for the treatment of UTIs. Established guidelines exist for the antimicrobial treatment and prevention of uncomplicated UTIs; however, antimicrobial dependence and overuse have led to the emergence of antimicrobial resistance. Nonantimicrobial alternatives are an ongoing area of research and should be considered when clinically appropriate based on available evidence.

### Scientific advances in understanding the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and prevention of urinary tract infection in the past 10 Years [^117BehL6]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a very common disease that is accompanied by various complications in the affected person. UTI triggers diverse inflammatory reactions locally in the infected urinary bladder and kidney, causing tissue destruction and organ failure. Moreover, systemic responses in the entire body carry the risk of urosepsis with far-reaching consequences. Understanding the cell-, organ-, and systemic mechanisms in UTI are crucial for prevention, early intervention, and current therapeutic approaches. This review summarizes the scientific advances over the last 10 years concerning pathogenesis, prevention, rapid diagnosis, and new treatment approaches. We also highlight the impact of the immune system and potential new therapies to reduce progressive and recurrent UTI.

### Urinary tract infections: microbial pathogenesis, host-pathogen interactions and new treatment strategies [^116tjdf4]. Nature Reviews: Microbiology (2020). High credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common, recurrent infections that can be mild to life-threatening. The continued emergence of antibiotic resistance, together with our increasing understanding of the detrimental effects conferred by broad-spectrum antibiotic use on the health of the beneficial microbiota of the host, has underscored the weaknesses in our current treatment paradigm for UTIs. In this Review, we discuss how recent microbiological, structural, genetic and immunological studies have expanded our understanding of host-pathogen interactions during UTI pathogenesis. These basic scientific findings have the potential to shift the strategy for UTI treatment away from broad-spectrum antibiotics targeting conserved aspects of bacterial replication towards pathogen-specific antibiotic-sparing therapeutics that target core determinants of bacterial virulence at the host-pathogen interface.

### Antibiotic management of urinary tract infections in the post-antibiotic era: a narrative review highlighting diagnostic and antimicrobial stewardship [^114hHBBu]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

As one of the most common indications for antimicrobial prescription in the community, the management of urinary tract infections (UTIs) is both complicated by, and a driver of, antimicrobial resistance.

Objectives

To highlight the key clinical decisions involved in the diagnosis and treatment of UTIs in adult women, focusing on clinical effectiveness and both diagnostic and antimicrobial stewardship as we approach the post-antimicrobial era.

Sources

Literature reviewed via directed PubMed searches and manual searching of the reference list for included studies to identify key references to respond to the objectives. A strict time limit was not applied. We prioritised recent publications, randomised trials, and systematic reviews (with or without meta-analyses) where available. Searches were limited to English language articles. A formal quality assessment was not performed; however, the strengths and limitations of each paper were reviewed by the authors throughout the preparation of this manuscript.

Content

We discuss the management of UTIs in ambulatory adult women, with particular focus on uncomplicated infections. We address the diagnosis of UTIs, including the following: definition and categorisation; bedside assessments and point-of-care tests; and the indications for, and use of, laboratory tests. We then discuss the treatment of UTIs, including the following: indications for treatment, antimicrobial sparing approaches, key considerations when selecting a specific antimicrobial agent, specific treatment scenarios, and duration of treatment. We finally outline emerging areas of interest in this field.

Implications

The steady increase in antimicrobial resistance among common uropathogens has had a substantial affect on the management of UTIs. Regarding both diagnosis and treatment, the clinician must consider both the patient (clinical effectiveness and adverse effects, including collateral damage) and the community more broadly (population-level antimicrobial selection pressure).

### Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI): clinical guidelines for treatment and management [^117Smpys]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) antibiotic duration — In patients presenting with complicated UTI (including acute pyelonephritis) and who are improving clinically on effective therapy, we suggest treating with a shorter course of antimicrobials, using either 5–7 days of a fluoroquinolone (conditional recommendation, moderate certainty of evidence) or 7 days of a non-fluoroquinolone antibiotic (conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence), rather than a longer course (10–14 days). An effective antimicrobial agent achieves therapeutic levels in the urine and relevant tissue and is active against the causative pathogen. The duration of therapy is counted from the first day of effective antibiotic therapy. Most studies supporting this recommendation excluded patients with indwelling urinary catheters, severe sepsis, immunocompromising conditions, abscesses in the urinary tract, chronic kidney disease, bacterial prostatitis, complete urinary obstruction, or undergoing urologic surgical procedures. Some patients in these subpopulations may be at higher risk for complications or treatment failure and may need an individualized duration of therapy. Men with febrile UTI in whom acute bacterial prostatitis is suspected may benefit from a longer treatment duration (i.e., 10–14 days), although evidence to guide the optimal duration in this subgroup is lacking. Consider evaluation for an ongoing nidus of infection requiring source control in patients who do not have prompt clinical improvement.

### Diagnosis and management of urinary tract infection and pyelonephritis [^115e9Bwk]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are the most common bacterial infections treated in the outpatient setting and range in severity from minimally symptomatic cystitis to severe septic shock in a wide array of patients. Diagnosis of uncomplicated cystitis can be inferred from history and physical, and confirmed by urinalysis. Appropriate antimicrobial therapy should rapidly improve symptoms in all UTIs. Treatment can be further tailored according to severity of illness, analysis of individualized risk factors, and antimicrobial resistance patterns. This article discusses treatment options in light of bacterial resistance in the twenty-first century.

### Urinary tract infections: pathogenesis, host susceptibility and emerging therapeutics [^116j5Mhf]. Nature Reviews: Microbiology (2025). High credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs), which include any infection of the urethra, bladder or kidneys, account for an estimated 400 million infections and billions of dollars in health-care spending per year. The most common bacterium implicated in UTI is uropathogenic Escherichia coli, but diverse pathogens including Klebsiella, Enterococcus, Pseudomonas, Staphylococcus and even yeast such as Candida species can also cause UTIs. UTIs occur in both women and men and in both healthy and immunocompromised patients. However, certain patient factors predispose to disease: for example, female sex, history of prior UTI, or the presence of a urinary catheter or other urinary tract abnormality. The current clinical paradigm for the treatment of UTIs involves the use of antibiotics. Unfortunately, the efficacy of this approach is dwindling as the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance rises among UTI isolates, and the immense quantity of antibiotics prescribed annually for these infections contributes to the emergence of resistant pathogens. Therefore, there is an urgent need for new antibiotics and non-antibiotic treatment and prevention strategies. In this Review, we discuss how recent studies of bacterial pathogenesis, recurrence, persistence, host-pathogen interactions and host susceptibility factors have elucidated new and promising targets for the treatment and prevention of UTIs.

### Treatment of bacterial urinary tract infections: presence and future [^1126ST1b]. European Urology (2006). Low credibility.

Bacterial urinary tract infections (UTIs) are frequent infections in the outpatient as well as in the nosocomial setting. The stratification into uncomplicated and complicated UTIs has proven to be clinically useful. Bacterial virulence factors on the one side and the integrity of the host defense mechanisms on the other side determine the course of the infection. In uncomplicated UTIs Escherichia coli is the leading organism, whereas in complicated UTIs the bacterial spectrum is much broader including Gram-negative and Gram-positive and often multiresistant organisms. The therapy of uncomplicated UTIs is almost exclusively antibacterial, whereas in complicated UTIs the complicating factors have to be treated as well. There are two predominant aims in the antimicrobial treatment of both uncomplicated and complicated UTIs: (i) rapid and effective response to therapy and prevention of recurrence of the individual patient treated; (ii) prevention of emergence of resistance to antimicrobial chemotherapy in the microbial environment. The main drawback of current antibiotic therapies is the emergence and rapid increase of antibiotic resistance. To combat this development several strategies can be followed. Decrease the amount of antibiotics administered, optimal dosing, prevention of infection and development of new antibiotic substances. The aim of this review is to highlight the current and to describe future treatment options for UTIs.

### Current and emerging strategies to curb antibiotic-resistant urinary tract infections [^113w9t1z]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2024). High credibility.

Rising rates of antibiotic resistance in uropathogenic bacteria compromise patient outcomes and prolong hospital stays. Consequently, new strategies are needed to prevent and control the spread of antibiotic resistance in uropathogenic bacteria. Over the past two decades, sizeable clinical efforts and research advances have changed urinary tract infection (UTI) treatment and prevention strategies to conserve antibiotic use. The emergence of antimicrobial stewardship, policies from national societies, and the development of new antimicrobials have shaped modern UTI practices. Future UTI management practices could be driven by the evolution of antimicrobial stewardship, improved and readily available diagnostics, and an improved understanding of how the microbiome affects UTI. Forthcoming UTI treatment and prevention strategies could employ novel bactericidal compounds, combinations of new and classic antimicrobials that enhance bacterial killing, medications that prevent bacterial attachment to uroepithelial cells, repurposing drugs, and vaccines to curtail the rising rates of antibiotic resistance in uropathogenic bacteria and improve outcomes in people with UTI.

### Urinary tract infections: current and emerging management strategies [^113efeWL]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Acute cystitis is one of the most commonly encountered bacterial infections and is responsible for substantial morbidity and high medical costs in the United States and across the globe. Though generally considered to be self-limiting and easily treated with antibiotics, urinary tract infections (UTIs) are often incompletely resolved by antibiotic therapy and frequently recur. This is in part due to the ability of uropathogenic bacteria to invade, replicate, and persist within host epithelial cells. The biological complexity of these infections combined with a dramatic rise in antibiotic-resistant pathogens highlight the need for alternative therapies. In this review we examine current management strategies for UTIs, as well as emerging treatments, including novel compounds that block bacterial interactions with the urothelium and vaccines focused on preventing both acute and recurrent infections.

### Urinary tract infections in children [^1132FL8r]. Pediatrics in Review (2024). Medium credibility.

Despite the American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines for the evaluation, treatment, and management of urinary tract infections (UTIs), UTI diagnosis and management remains challenging for clinicians. Challenges with acute UTI management stem from vague presenting signs and symptoms, diagnostic uncertainty, limitations in laboratory testing, and selecting appropriate antibiotic therapy in an era with increasing rates of antibiotic-resistant uropathogens. Recurrent UTI management remains difficult due to an incomplete understanding of the factors contributing to UTI, when to assess a child with repeated infections for kidney and urinary tract anomalies, and limited prevention strategies. To help reduce these uncertainties, this review provides a comprehensive overview of UTI epidemiology, risk factors, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention strategies that may help pediatricians overcome the challenges associated with acute and recurrent UTI management.

### Use of machine learning to assess the management of uncomplicated urinary tract infection [^114FurQs]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Are treatments for uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI) recommended in national guidelines published in 2011 still optimal?

Findings

Using a large regional claims dataset for 57 585 episodes of UTI occurring in 49 037 female patients, this cohort study found that guideline-concordant first-line treatments retained their efficacy vs fluoroquinolones and outperformed β-lactam antibiotics with respect to efficacy and adverse events.

Meaning

Even though the national treatment guidelines for uncomplicated UTI were published nearly 14 years ago, these findings suggest that outpatient antimicrobial stewardship programs should continue to encourage clinicians to follow them.

### Urinary tract infection [^114AzavG]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common in both inpatient and outpatient settings. This article provides an evidence-based, clinically relevant overview of management of UTIs, including screening, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention. Conditions covered include acute cystitis (both uncomplicated and complicated), catheter-associated UTI, and asymptomatic bacteriuria in both women and men.

### Urinary tract infection and pyelonephritis [^115fyFbG]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

UTIs are common, potentially severe infections that the emergency physician must manage efficiently and effectively. In most cases, this entity is well recognized, and the clinician will be confident of the correct course. However, in certain populations, complications are common, and the best therapy has yet to be proven. Tailoring the evaluation and treatment to the risk of complications is imperative. With careful evaluation, individualized therapy and close follow-up, the majority of patients can be expected to do well.

### A review for clinical practice in the treatment and prevention of recurrent urinary tract infections in women over age 65 [^113ZsabT]. Journal of Women's Health (2024). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a pervasive, costly, and dangerous cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, which can lead to further complications if they become recurrent or progress to urosepsis. Recurrent UTI is a particular concern among postmenopausal females because of increased risk factors and decreased estrogen levels, leading to changes in the urogenital epithelium and subsequently causing alterations in the urogenital microbiome. Prevention strategies for recurrent UTIs are often incorporated into patient-centered care plans, but finding the right management can be difficult for older women since many of the common treatment options have contraindications and adverse side effects. This review aims to describe the diagnosis, treatment, and special considerations for the treatment and prevention of recurrent UTIs in women over 65. Current prevention strategies include both antibiotic and nonantibiotic options. The antibiotic choice for older women presents a few unique challenges, including frequent allergy or intolerance of side effects, renal or liver dysfunction, and polypharmacy or drug interactions. Nonantibiotic options range from readily accessible drugstore remedies to experimental vaccines, which all are accompanied by certain advantages and disadvantages. Appropriate management plans can help to reduce symptoms and poor outcomes among older females. In addition, we hope future studies continue to investigate the proper dosing and routes for optimal management in this aging female population.

### Urinary tract infections [^112J2vFX]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is the second most common bacterial infection in children and is considered a public health threat given the mounting rates of antibiotic-resistance among uropathogens. This article highlights recent encouraging developments in UTI research. Further work is necessary to translate the discoveries into accessible, cost-effective technologies that will aid clinicians in real-time decision-making.

### Antibiotic resistance of urinary tract infection recurrences in a large integrated US healthcare system [^115tHio8]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Increasing antibiotic resistance limits antibiotic options for outpatient treatment of UTIs and renders antibiotic treatment less effective. As repeated UTIs are a major cause of antibiotic resistance, a better understanding of uropathogens responsible for recurrence is needed. Importantly, given that antibiotic therapy for UTI is empiric and uropathogens increasingly demonstrate nonsusceptibility, continuously updated data on susceptibility patterns are critical to guide appropriate antibiotic prescribing as well as to inform interventions to prevent UTI recurrence. As the degree of resistance to the most frequently prescribed antibiotics for UTI evolves over time and may vary by region, it is also important to continuously monitor the local prevalence of uropathogens and their susceptibility to guide appropriate antibiotic use.

### Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI): clinical guidelines for treatment and management [^112bPvv4]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Selection of definitive antibiotic therapy for complicated UTI — In patients with confirmed complicated UTI, we suggest selecting a definitive effective antibiotic with a targeted spectrum based on the results of urine culture (identification and susceptibility) as soon as these are available, rather than continuing empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics for the complete duration of treatment (conditional recommendation, low certainty of the evidence). The comment states that this recommendation places a high value on de-escalating antibiotic therapy based on culture results and notes that de-escalation may be less practical in cases of cUTI managed in the outpatient setting.

### Diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of catheter-associated urinary tract infection in adults: 2009 international clinical practice guidelines from the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^115Xk6Uu]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Guidelines for the diagnosis, prevention, and management of persons with catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CA-UTI), both symptomatic and asymptomatic, were prepared by an Expert Panel of the Infectious Diseases Society of America. The evidence-based guidelines encompass diagnostic criteria, strategies to reduce the risk of CA-UTIs, strategies that have not been found to reduce the incidence of urinary infections, and management strategies for patients with catheter-associated asymptomatic bacteriuria or symptomatic urinary tract infection. These guidelines are intended for use by physicians in all medical specialties who perform direct patient care, with an emphasis on the care of patients in hospitals and long-term care facilities.

### CAUTIon-not all UTIs are the same [^1143DosV]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2025). High credibility.

Urinary tract infections are one of the most common infections, accounting for ~400 million diagnoses per year worldwide. Uncomplicated urinary tract infections (uUTIs) occur in healthy individuals with no structural or functional abnormalities of the urinary system and primarily affect women. Catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs) are a type of complicated UTI affecting patients who have a urinary catheter in place, often hospitalized patients or patients with conditions that prevent them from urinating naturally. Both infections share common symptoms, diagnostics and treatment options but also differ greatly in pathophysiology, aetiology, risk factors and comorbidities. These differences could explain why antibiotic treatments - which generally lead to positive outcomes in patients with uUTIs - often fail in patients with CAUTIs. Understanding these differences could guide evidence-based insights into why treatments for CAUTIs should be different from those for uUTIs, specifically, by modifying catheters, which initiate the damage-induced segue for UTIs.

### Uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women [^1142cqa9]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTIs) present a significant problem for women and a challenge for the doctors who care for them. The diagnosis of uncomplicated UTI, which usually is not challenging, can be achieved best by a thorough assessment of patient symptoms with or without the addition of a urine dipstick test. Treatment should be based on the most recent Infectious Disease Society of America guidelines, taking into account resistance patterns in the local community. The patient who suffers from recurrent UTIs can be treated safely and effectively with continuous antibiotic prophylaxis, postcoital therapy, or self-initiated treatment.

### Recurrent urinary tract infections: diagnosis, treatment, and prevention [^113AFvAL]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infections are common infections seen by obstetrician/gynecologists and primary care providers. Recurrent urinary tract infections are difficult to treat and decrease quality of life. This article addresses the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of recurrent urinary tract infections, including pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions. Most notably, increased interest in the urinary microbiome is leading to improved understanding of virulent and commensal bacteria in the genitourinary tract. Understanding the causative factors of recurrent urinary tract infections will lead to improved detection, treatment, and prevention.

Complicated UTI with Gram-negative bacteremia — In patients presenting with complicated UTI with associated Gram-negative bacteremia and who are improving clinically on effective therapy, we suggest treating with a shorter course (7 days) of antimicrobial therapy rather than a longer course (14 days) (conditional recommendation, low certainty in the evidence). An effective antimicrobial agent for bacteremic patients means that the antibiotic achieves therapeutic levels in the bloodstream, urine, and relevant tissue and is active against the causative pathogen. The duration of therapy is counted from the first day of effective antibiotic therapy.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is one of the most frequent bacterial infections diagnosed in older adults and the most common reason for antibiotic prescriptions in nursing homes. Distinguishing between asymptomatic bacteriuria and UTI in older adults can be challenging and implementing a systematic approach to diagnosis using standard toolkits or algorithms is recommended for patients residing in post-acute and long-term care settings. This article reviews the pathophysiology, microbiology, diagnostic approach, treatment, and approaches to prophylaxis in the older adult.

### Phage therapy for urinary tract infections: progress and challenges ahead [^113Sj4KX]. International Urogynecology Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is one of the most common types of bacterial infection, affecting at least 150 million people annually worldwide based on epidemiological estimates over 2 decades ago, with recent estimates as high as 400 million. Half of women will have at least one UTI during their lifetime and of these ~ 30% will develop recurrent UTI (defined as symptomatic culture-proven UTI at least twice in 6 months or three times in a year). Recurrent UTI is associated with the development of intracellular bacterial reservoirs, which may serve as the nidus for subsequent infections and reduce the efficacy of antibiotic therapy. Recurrent UTI is associated with repetitive and extended antibiotic use and poses significant therapeutic and public health issues owing to alarming increases in antibiotic resistance. Additionally, the development of new antibiotics has been unable to keep up with the concerning rise in antibiotic resistance, highlighting the need for novel therapeutic options. Current vaccine trials for UTI have had limited impact. Here, we review the putative role of bacteriophage (phage) therapy as a therapeutic for UTI, highlight patient and microbiological factors that might impact successful treatment, and suggest reporting standards for future work to help to advance the field.

### The urinary microbiome: improving diagnostics and management of urinary tract infections in adult females [^111pQV8y]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

This article discusses the urinary microbiome in relation to urinary tract infection (UTI) in women. It makes biologic sense that the microbiota of different niches (bladder, vagina, and gut) interact with each other in health, as well as during a UTI event; however, these relationships remain poorly understood. Future research should close knowledge gaps regarding the interactions between the urinary microbiota and the host, amongst the microbiota of adjacent niches, and between the microbes within the same microbiota. The new knowledge should result in improved UTI treatment in the age of antibiotic stewardship.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) diagnostic policy considerations: Harms/risks/costs state that stringent diagnostic criteria may miss a small number of UTIs, the benefit-harms assessment is a preponderance of benefit over harm, and value judgments note that treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria may be harmful; the role of patient preferences is that parents prefer no action in the absence of a UTI (avoiding false-positive results) over a very small chance of missing a UTI, with exclusions noted as none, intentional vagueness as none, and policy level as recommendation.

### Urine trouble: should we think differently about UTI? [^115iUiqd]. International Urogynecology Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is clinically important, given that it is one of the most common bacterial infections in adult women. However, the current understanding of UTI remains based on a now disproven concept that the urinary bladder is sterile. Thus, current standards for UTI diagnosis have significant limitations that may reduce the opportunity to improve patient care. Using data from our work and numerous other peer-reviewed studies, we identified four major limitations to the contemporary UTI description: the language of UTI, UTI diagnostic testing, the Escherichia coli-centric view of UTI, and the colony-forming units (CFU) threshold-based diagnosis. Contemporary methods and technology, combined with continued rigorous clinical research can be used to correct these limitations.

### Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI): clinical guidelines for treatment and management [^112BXcnZ]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Timing of intravenous to oral antibiotics transition for complicated UTI — In patients with complicated UTI (including acute pyelonephritis) treated initially with parenteral therapy who are clinically improving, able to take oral medication, and for whom an effective oral option is available, we suggest transitioning to oral antibiotics rather than continuing parenteral therapy for the remaining treatment duration (conditional recommendation, low certainty of the evidence). The trials supporting this recommendation mostly excluded patients with indwelling urinary catheters, sepsis or septic shock, immunocompromised states, severe renal insufficiency, and functional or structural abnormalities of the urinary tract, and some patients in these subpopulations may need an individualized plan of therapy. An effective antimicrobial agent means that the antibiotic achieves therapeutic levels in the urine and relevant tissue and is active against the causative pathogen.

### State-of-the-art review: recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women [^1175RXfj]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Over 50% of adult women experience at least 1 urinary tract infection (UTI) in their lifetime, and almost one-quarter of them will experience a recurrent UTI (rUTI). Recurrent UTI is defined as ≥ 2 UTIs in a 6-month period or ≥ 3 UTIs in 12 months (at least 1 of these episodes should be culture-proven to confirm infectious etiology). In this narrative review, we discuss the epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment considerations for recurrent uncomplicated cystitis in the adult female population. We provide a focused overview of the comprehensive management of these patients, with input from infectious disease physicians, urogynecologists, and urologists with expertise in rUTI, highlighting updated recommendations by the Infectious Diseases Society of America, American Urologic Association, Canadian Urologic Association, and American Urogynecologic Society. Finally, given the variety of prevention strategies, different treatment goals, and the need for "preference sensitive" decisions, we highlight the need for shared decision-making with patients.

### Urinary tract infection: traditional pharmacologic therapies [^116BugNg]. The American Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common bacterial infections, particularly in women. Antimicrobial therapy is seldom indicated for asymptomatic infection, but antimicrobial therapy is usually indicated for amelioration of symptoms. Management of acute uncomplicated UTI (cystitis) is generally straightforward, with a predictable distribution of uropathogens isolated. First-line treatment of acute uncomplicated UTI has traditionally involved a 3-day regimen of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) or TMP alone for patients with sulfa allergies. Increasing resistance among community-acquired Escherichia coli to TMP-SMX worldwide has led to a reassessment of the most appropriate empiric therapy for these infections. Alternative first-line agents include the fluoroquinolones, nitrofurantoin, and fosfomycin. Factors to be considered in the selection of appropriate antimicrobial therapy include pharmacokinetics, spectrum of activity of the antimicrobial agent, resistance prevalence for the community, potential for adverse effects, and duration of therapy. Ideal antimicrobial agents for UTI management have primary excretion routes through the urinary tract to achieve high urinary drug levels. In addition, there are special considerations in the management of UTI among selected populations, including postmenopausal and pregnant women, and for women with frequent recurrent UTIs.

### Novel technologies for the diagnosis of urinary tract infections [^1174T2WE]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Medium credibility.

THE CLINICAL LANDSCAPE OF URINARY TRACT INFECTIONS

An estimated 400 million urinary tract infections (UTIs) occur each year globally, with over 200,000 associated deaths, making UTIs one of the most common bacterial diseases and drivers of antimicrobial usage. UTIs disproportionately affect women, up to 60% of whom experience at least one UTI in their lifetime. This association is generally attributed to anatomy, although hormonal factors also play an increasingly recognized role, including in relation to the vaginal microbiome. Traditionally, a UTI is defined by clinical signs and symptoms such as urinary frequency, urgency, pelvic or lower abdominal pain, pyuria, or urinary incontinence — often in combination with identification of an offending pathogen via urine culture. This symptom-based approach to UTIs can lack sensitivity or specificity in certain populations, including the very young and elderly, or individuals who are chronically catheterized, with urologic or neurologic abnormalities. For these patients, signs and symptoms can be ambiguous.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® recurrent lower urinary tract infections in females [^111Gwyks]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) in women are common, with an overall lifetime risk over > 50%. UTIs are considered recurrent when they follow complete clinical resolution of a previous UTI and are usually defined as at least three episodes of infection within the preceding 12 months. An uncomplicated UTI is classified as a UTI without structural or functional abnormalities of the urinary tract and without relevant comorbidities. Complicated UTIs are those occurring in patients with underlying structural or medical problems. In women with recurrent uncomplicated UTIs, cystoscopy and imaging are not routinely used. In women suspected of having a recurrent complicated UTI, cystoscopy and imaging should be considered. CT urography or MR urography are usually appropriate for the evaluation of recurrent complicated lower urinary tract infections or for women who are nonresponders to conventional therapy, develop frequent reinfections or relapses, or have known underlying risk factors. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Urinary tract infection and asymptomatic bacteriuria in older adults [^113kGXtE]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a significant cause of morbidity among older adults. However, antibiotic prescriptions for clinically suspected UTIs are often inappropriate. Health care providers frequently struggle to differentiate UTI from asymptomatic bacteriuria, particularly in patients presenting with nonspecific symptoms. Patients with baseline cognitive impairments that limit history-taking can be particularly challenging. This article reviews the epidemiology and pathogenesis of UTI in older adults. It discusses an approach to diagnosis and treatment focused on recognizing patients who would likely benefit from antibiotic treatment and on identifying patients for whom empiric antibiotic therapy should not be given.

American Academy of Pediatrics urinary tract infection guideline — antimicrobial prophylaxis considerations state that although effectiveness for prevention of UTI has not been demonstrated, the concept has biological plausibility. Antimicrobials reach high urinary concentrations, yet barriers include adherence to a daily regimen, adverse effects, and emergence of antimicrobial resistance. Evidence of effectiveness with a well-tolerated, safe product and parent education are needed; a urinary antiseptic that could be taken indefinitely without resistance is particularly desirable, and probiotics are another possible strategy.

### Guidelines for the treatment of pneumonia and urinary tract infections: evaluation of methodological quality using the appraisal of guidelines, research and evaluation II instrument [^115wCJ11]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2013). Low credibility.

Reliance on evidence-based medicine requires high methodological standards from guideline developers. We sought to determine the methodological quality of guidelines on pneumonia and urinary tract infections (UTIs). We included guidelines published by national or international committees in the last 10 years providing recommendations for antibiotic type or duration. We applied the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II checklist, adding under each item the specific focus relevant to bacterial infections, addressing antibiotic resistance and local epidemiology. Three assessors scored each guideline independently. Mean aggregated scores, converted to percentage per domain, are presented. We included 13 guidelines on the treatment of pneumonia and seven guidelines for the treatment of UTI. 'Scope and purpose' scored 69.4% for pneumonia and 71.4% for UTI. Guidelines were downgraded for lack of an epidemiological overview relevant to intended users. 'Stakeholder involvement' scored 39.5% for pneumonia and 44.5% UTI, with the major fault being lack of patient consultation. 'Rigour of development' scored 42.8% for pneumonia and 56.9% for UTI. Commonly, the search process lacked precision, no risk of bias assessment was performed, outcomes in primary studies were not critically assessed or used to direct recommendations, and there was no formal methodology for formulating recommendations. 'Clarity of presentation' scored highest: 67.7% for pneumonia and 68.5% for UTI. 'Applicability' of the guidelines in antibiotic stewardship programmes was usually not addressed: 16.9% and 25.4%, respectively. 'Editorial independence' scored 30.6% for pneumonia and 55.6% for UTI. Formal examination of guidelines in infectious diseases showed worrying findings related to core methodology and potential bias caused by competing interests.

Self-treatment with antibiotics for recurrent UTI — Self-treatment can be paired with standing physician orders for urine culture before and possibly after treatment, but compared with continuous prophylaxis it is associated with a higher rate of infection (2.2 UTI per year vs 0.2 UTI per year). Self-treatment is an option for women with the ability to reliably recognize UTI symptoms and start antibiotics, those not suitable for long-term prophylaxis, or those who do not wish to take long-term therapy, and patients should contact their clinician if symptoms progress or fail to resolve within 48 hours. Fluoroquinolones are not preferred agents for self-treatment regimens, and we recommend use of other agents whenever possible.

### Is non-steroidal anti-inflammatory therapy non-inferior to antibiotic therapy in uncomplicated urinary tract infections: a systematic review [^111DGJZF]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common, ranking as the second most frequent indication for antibiotic prescribing in the outpatient setting. The majority of UTIs are "uncomplicated", occurring in non-pregnant adult women who are not immunocompromised and have normal genitourinary structure and function. Each year, 12.6% of women will have a UTI, and half of all women will have at least one UTI by age 32. The standard of care for uncomplicated UTI is oral antibiotic therapy, which typically leads to rapid symptom resolution and reduces the risk of complications such as pyelonephritis.

In recent years, growing antibiotic resistance has led to efforts to use antibiotics more judiciously. Specifically for uncomplicated UTIs, these initiatives have sought to reduce the amount — either duration or frequency — and spectrum of antibiotics. – Interviews with women indicate willingness to delay or avoid antibiotic prescriptions when safe to do so. Furthermore, some UTIs are self-limited without treatment and thus may not require antibiotic therapy. For example, a randomized controlled trial comparing nitrofurantoin with placebo for uncomplicated UTI demonstrated spontaneous symptomatic cure or improvement in over half of participants receiving placebo who had UTIs as proven by a combination of symptoms/signs and positive laboratory testing. While a meta-analysis of placebo-controlled trials found placebo to be inferior to antibiotics for resolution of UTI symptoms, it is unclear whether non-antibiotic treatment regimens for uncomplicated UTIs may be feasible as an outpatient antibiotic stewardship strategy. For example, cranberry extract was initially considered a potential antibiotic-sparing option; however, subsequent research has not supported its use in the treatment of UTI over antibiotics.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® urinary tract infection-child: 2023 update [^117W3So1]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a frequent infection in childhood. The diagnosis is usually made by history and physical examination and confirmed by urine analysis. Cystitis is infection or inflammation confined to the bladder, whereas pyelonephritis is infection or inflammation of kidneys. Pyelonephritis can cause renal scarring, which is the most severe long-term sequela of UTI and can lead to accelerated nephrosclerosis, leading to hypertension and chronic renal failure. The role of imaging is to guide treatment by identifying patients who are at high risk to develop recurrent UTIs or renal scarring. This document provides initial imaging guidelines for children presenting with first febrile UTI with appropriate response to medical management, atypical or recurrent febrile UTI, and follow-up imaging for children with established vesicoureteral reflux. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

### American Urogynecologic Society best-practice statement: recurrent urinary tract infection in adult women [^117H4oaD]. Female Pelvic Medicine & Reconstructive Surgery (2018). Medium credibility.

Acute urinary tract infection (UTI) with complicating factors — empiric management and pyelonephritis exclusions: When empiric therapy of an acute UTI with complicating factors is initiated, treatment should be reevaluated once urine culture and sensitivity results are available; the initial selection of empiric therapy should reflect the patient's individual uropathogen history, current treatment (eg, if currently on UTI suppression antibiotics), and response to prior therapy, and if clinically reasonable, antimicrobial therapy should be delayed pending culture results and organism susceptibility so antimicrobial treatment can be targeted based on the uropathogen profile. For pyelonephritis, several otherwise useful UTI antibiotics are not recommended for acute pyelonephritis treatment, including nitrofurantoin and fosfomycin; TMP-SMX is not recommended for empiric treatment because of high rates of TMP-SMX resistance, and empirically initiated antibiotics should be refined when the urine culture results are available.

Recurrent urinary tract infection (rUTI) treatment principles — treatment options "can be stratified by whether complicating features, such as known abnormal genitourinary anatomy, immunosuppression, and chronic catheterization, are present", and "Antibiotic therapy is typically used to treat active infections and prevent future infections; the treatment regimen, route, and duration will vary based on the clinical situation and should be individualized for each patient"; strategies "can be divided into treatment of an acute episode (provider prescribed or self-treatment) or prophylaxis (to prevent further episodes)"; "Whenever possible, rUTI patients should have a culture sent before treatment", although "Empiric therapy can be initiated before urine culture results if clinically indicated (such as history of UTI-related sepsis or pyelonephritis)", and "Antibiotic choice should be tailored to the individual patient and pathogens, community and patient resistance patterns, costs, drug availability, patient allergies, and patient tolerance/ability to comply"; clinicians "should be familiar with the antibiotic-resistant patterns in their communities which is generally available via antibiograms through any clinical laboratory", and "Empiric regimens should be altered if necessary based on the urine culture results".

### Quality appraisal of clinical guidelines for recurrent urinary tract infections using AGREE II: a systematic review [^113WX9RR]. International Urogynecology Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Of the eight CPGs identified for the assessment and treatment of recurrent UTI, our multidisciplinary review team could only recommend two as being of sufficiently high quality for use without adjustment. Another three were also considered to be of high quality, but these could only be recommended with modifications. This illustrates the need to improve CPG development on this topic. In line with previous evaluations, the scope and purpose and clarity of presentation domains had the highest scores, while the stakeholder involvement and applicability domains had the lowest scores.

The domains requiring further attention from CPG developers are discussed below.

Domain 2: Stakeholder involvement

It is important that the CPG development group includes professionals from all relevant groups, clearly defines CPG users, and seeks the views and thoughts of the target population. This could be achieved throughout a discussion meeting with patients, including patients in the development group or as external referents. Ideally, these patients should be trained to perform these tasks. Five CPGs in this review did consider patients' views during their development, but none reported those views. Simply providing the patients views and thoughts in a supplement helps with this issue. Further improvement for example could be to add "patient recommended" under the levels of evidence.

Domain 3: Rigour of development

Developmental rigour, including adequate assessment of the level of evidence of recommendations, probably influences the content of a CPG the most. We found various methods for reporting the evidence levels and grading recommendations among the included CPGs, which had the potential to hinder the user's ability to compare recommendations. GRADE provides a rigorous and explicit framework for rating the quality of evidence and strength of a recommendation, and its use could help to improve the quality of a CPG. Moreover, it is widely adopted and could be used as a standard for developing CPGs.

Consistent with a previous AGREE review, updating procedures were poorly reported, underlining the need for this to change. There has been little research into the time frame for updating CPGs, but intervals between 1 and 5 years have been suggested. Given that studies regarding prevention and diagnostics for recurrent UTI are far less common than those for studies regarding other pathology (e.g. malignancy), we decided that 5 years is an acceptable time frame. On that basis, six of the eight included CPGs may be considered up to date. Updating a whole guideline is an intensive and time-consuming process. Topics and recommendations often differ in the terms of the need for updating; therefore, partial updating seems like a logical solution.

### Use of machine learning to assess the management of uncomplicated urinary tract infection [^112e6Ry3]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Up to 50% of women will experience a urinary tract infection (UTI) in their lifetime, making it the third most common indication for antibiotic treatment in the US after respiratory tract infection and skin and soft-tissue infections. Treatment guidelines published by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) in 2011 encouraged the use of nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and fosfomycin as first-line treatments for uncomplicated UTI on the basis of their effectiveness and relatively limited adverse event profile. Fluoroquinolones are listed as an alternative option because of their predilection for selecting for multidrug-resistant organismsand their association with serious adverse events, including Clostridium difficile colitis. Despite this, ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin are still the most commonly used antibiotics in the treatment of UTI, which may reflect the real or perceived threat of antibiotic resistance to the first-line agents. The guidelines list β-lactams as an inferior alternative because they are associated with reduced treatment effectiveness.

The evidence supporting the IDSA treatment guidelines is based on a small number of randomized clinical trials and observational studies, many of which were completed several decades ago. Although those studies provided important information for policymaking, they were limited in terms of the diversity of patients they recruited and were performed at a time when standards of care and health care–seeking behavior differed greatly from current practice. Furthermore, the pathogen strains in circulation at the time of these studies have likely been replaced by new strains that may have a differential response to drug therapies, regardless of their susceptibility phenotype. Therefore, a re-evaluation of management strategies for uncomplicated UTI could provide useful information for treating clinicians and policymakers. In this study, we sought to estimate treatment effectiveness and adverse events for guideline-concordant and guideline-discordant treatments for UTI using causal inference supported by machine learning applied to a large contemporary claims dataset.

### The global burden of antimicrobial resistance-urinary tract infections [^115rRycJ]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has emerged as a significant global healthcare problem. Antibiotic use has accelerated the physiologic process of AMR, particularly in Gram-negative pathogens. Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are predominantly of a Gram-negative nature. Uropathogens are evolutionarily highly adapted and selected strains with specific virulence factors, suggesting common mechanisms in how bacterial cells acquire virulence and AMR factors. The simultaneous increase in resistance and virulence is a complex and context-dependent phenomenon. Among known AMR mechanisms, the plenitude of different β-lactamases is especially prominent. The risk for AMR in UTIs varies in different patient populations. A history of antibiotic consumption and the physiology of urinary flow are major factors that shape AMR prevalence. The urinary tract is in close crosstalk with the microbiome of other compartments, including the gut and genital tracts. In addition, pharmacokinetic properties and the physiochemical composition of urinary compartments can contribute to the emergence of AMR. Alternatives to antibiotic treatment and a broader approach to address bacterial infections are needed. Among the various alternatives studied, antimicrobial peptides and bacteriophage treatment appear to be highly promising approaches. We herein summarize the present knowledge of clinical and microbiological AMR in UTIs and discuss innovative approaches, namely new risk prediction tools and the use of non-antibiotic approaches to defend against uropathogenic microbes.

### Antibiotics for asymptomatic bacteriuria [^11285KoG]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Asymptomatic bacteriuria is commonly detected in women aged up to 60 years, patients with diabetes, and the elderly. The benefit of antibiotic treatment for this condition is controversial.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and safety of antibiotics treatment for asymptomatic bacteriuria in adults. Specific objectives were to assess 1) the effectiveness of antibiotics for preventing development of symptomatic UTI, UTI-related complications, overall mortality, UTI-related mortality, and resolution of bacteriuria; 2) the development of resistance to antibiotic treatment by comparing resistance of grown bacteria in urine before and after therapy; and 3) the frequency of adverse events.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Renal Group's Specialised Register up to 24 February 2015 through contact with the Trials' Search Co-ordinator using search terms relevant to this review.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs comparing antibiotics to placebo or no treatment for asymptomatic bacteriuria in adults were included. The outcomes of interest were the development of symptomatic urinary tract infection (UTI), complications, death, any adverse event, development of antibiotic resistance, bacteriological cure, and decline in kidney function.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently extracted the data and assessed study quality. Statistical analyses were performed using the random effects model and the results expressed as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

We included nine studies (1614 participants) in this review. Symptomatic UTI (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.51 to 2.43), complications (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0. 35 to 1.74), and death (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.41) were similar between the antibiotic and placebo or no treatment arms. Antibiotics were more effective for bacteriological cure (RR 2.32, 95% CI 1.11 to 4.83) but also more adverse events developed in this group (RR 3.77, 95% CI 1.40 to 10.15). No decline in the kidney function was observed across the studies; minimal data were available on the emergence of resistant strains after antimicrobial treatment. The included studies were of medium and high quality, used different treatments for different durations of treatment and follow-up, different populations, but this did not appear to influence the results of review.

Authors' Conclusions

No differences were observed between antibiotics versus no treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria for the development of symptomatic UTI, complications or death. Antibiotics were superior to no treatment for the bacteriological cure but with significantly more adverse events. There was no clinical benefit from treating asymptomatic bacteriuria in the studies included in this review.

Recurrent urinary tract infection — posttreatment urine culture and test-of-cure: The Canadian Urological Association guidelines suggest repeating a urine culture 1 to 2 weeks after treatment to test for persistence, and a negative posttreatment urine culture provides evidence of effective treatment; in the absence of a negative posttreatment urine culture, it is possible that a 2 or 3 UTI episodes are related to a single persistent uropathogen, though some experts recommend against posttreatment testing to lessen antibiotic exposure, noting in a randomized trial that treated young women with asymptomatic bacteriuria were more likely to develop subsequent infections and more likely to develop antibiotic-resistant organisms.

### Guidelines for complicated urinary tract infections in children: a review by the European society for pediatric infectious diseases [^1116o5L4]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI) present a challenge to the clinician because of the variety of clinical syndromes included and consequent difficulties in synthesizing evidence for practical guidance. The cumulative incidence of all childhood UTI by the age of 7 years is 1%–2% in boys and 7% in girls. Of those presenting to emergency, 5%–24% are deemed cUTI, so it is a common childhood infection. However, defining what makes a UTI complicated is difficult because it has been characterized by a variety of UTI syndromes, which include hosts with abnormal urology or other underlying conditions, severe clinical presentations with or without extensive tissue involvement, and unusual pathogens. For this review and guideline, cUTIs are those that require other management considerations than straightforward lower or upper tract UTIs for which evidence and guidelines exist. Accurate diagnosis and management of cUTI limit morbidity and mortality from sepsis and long-term renal damage. However, most trials of UTI in children have excluded those with cUTI, and consequently, many guidelines also exclude them. The absence of a standardized definition for cUTI has resulted in inconsistencies in treatment approaches, which may lead to increased morbidity among affected children. Existing major UTI guidelines for children either do not address complicated UTIs at all or are limited to only some complications or some age groups. –

This review aims to address the four most important controversies when managing children with cUTI and provide recommendations for definition, investigations, treatment and follow-up. The resulting guidelines offer evidence-graded recommendations specifically for the management of pediatric cUTI, addressing gaps that exist in current guidelines.

### Management of urinary tract infections: historical perspective and current strategies: part 2 – modern management [^113KKVik]. The Journal of Urology (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose

An understanding of the microbial origin of infectious diseases and the introduction of antimicrobial therapy stimulated more advances in the management of urinary tract infections (UTIs) in the 20th century than had occurred in the previous 5 centuries.

Materials and Methods

Numerous resources were used to collect the information described in this review. Medical texts from the 19th and 20th century contain information regarding the traditional contemporary treatment of UTI during those eras. Early volumes of the Journal of Urology from the beginning of the 20th century describe the first attempts at chemotherapy for UTI. MEDLINE searches were used to collect appropriate information after 1969. Modern medical journals and modern medical texts were used to collect information on antimicrobial therapy since the late 1960s through today.

Results

Numerous advances in the diagnosis and management of UTI were made during the 20th century. Advances in microbiological and chemical assays have facilitated the development of historical uroscopy into modern day urinalysis and culture techniques, which are the cornerstone of UTI diagnosis. Imaging technologies, including x-ray, ultrasound, nuclear imaging, magnetic resonance and computerized tomography, have been particularly helpful in the diagnosis of complicated or recurrent UTIs. Major innovations in nonpharmacological therapy include noninvasive shock wave lithotripsy and percutaneous drainage of kidney abscesses. The most profound advance in UTI management during the 20th century was the discovery of antimicrobial agents. Nitrofurantoin was the first truly effective and safe antimicrobial therapy for UTI but its spectrum of activity is limited. Broad use of amoxicillin (and other beta-lactams) after its introduction in the 1970s led to the development of resistance to this antimicrobial, prompting a gradual change to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) as first line therapy for UTI. However, wide use of TMP/SMX also resulted in the progressive emergence of resistance, limiting the clinical usefulness of this therapy in the modern management of UTI. Fluoroquinolones offer an attractive alternative to TMP/SMX, and American and European guidelines recommend their empirical use in areas where TMP/SMX resistance is 10% or higher.

Conclusions

The development of antimicrobial therapy was the defining moment of 20th century medicine and one of the key innovations in medical history. While the initial promise of antimicrobials has been validated in clinical practice, overuse of certain agents has led to the emergence of resistance, illustrating the importance of using evidence based strategies to select therapy.

### Cost effectiveness of management strategies for urinary tract infections: results from randomised controlled trial [^1176LkpS]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Urinary tract infections are common in female patients in general practice, and urine is the most frequently received specimen in microbiology laboratories. These common bacterial infections affect half of all women at least once in their lives. Clinical management strategies vary, with empirical antibiotics commonly used. Many practitioners, however, also use urinary dipstick results and request analysis of midstream urine samples. In over 62% of women presenting with suspected urinary tract infection, the diagnosis is laboratory confirmed. The use of dipsticks and clinical scoring algorithms can potentially help to improve the precision of diagnosis by improving the positive predictive values. It is unclear what effects different management strategies will have on the costs and cost effectiveness. We carried out an economic evaluation alongside a randomised controlled trial to investigate the costs and cost effectiveness of the different management strategies for urinary tract infection.

### Urinary alkalisation for symptomatic uncomplicated urinary tract infection in women [^113kmWf7]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI) is the most common bacterial infection in women, characterised by dysuria and urinary frequency. Urinary alkalisers are widely used in some countries for the symptomatic treatment of uncomplicated UTI, and they are recommended in some national formularies. However, there is a lack of empirical evidence to support their use for UTI and some healthcare guidelines advise against their use.

Objectives

We aimed to look at the benefits and harms of the use of urinary alkalisers for the treatment of uncomplicated UTIs in adult women.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Specialised Register to 19 January 2016 through contact with the Trials Search Co-ordinator using search terms relevant to this review.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs on the use of (any) urinary alkalisers (either exclusively or non-exclusively) for the symptomatic treatment of uncomplicated UTI amongst women aged 16 and over, were included. Studies were eligible if they included patients whose diagnosis of UTI was decided by symptoms alone, or positive urine dipstick test or urine culture; and patients with recurrent UTI, provided patients had no symptoms of UTI in the two weeks prior to the onset of symptoms that lead them to seek medical advice. Studies were ineligible if they studied patients with complicated UTIs; immune-compromising conditions; acute pyelonephritis; or chronic conditions such as interstitial cystitis.

Data Collection and Analysis

Three authors independently assessed and screened papers, and this was repeated by two separate authors (independently). An additional investigator acted as arbitrator, where necessary. There were no papers which fulfilled the inclusion criteria for this review, and therefore no data extraction was performed.

Main Results

Our search identified 172 potential studies for inclusion. However, following assessment none fulfilled the inclusion criteria for this review.

Authors' Conclusions

Until relevant evidence is generated from randomised trials, the safety and efficacy of urinary alkalisers for the symptomatic treatment of uncomplicated UTI remains unknown.

### Consensus position statement on advancing the classification of patients and tests of cure in studies of antibiotic treatment of complicated urinary tract infections [^111ndMsp]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Complicated urinary tract infections denote an important research field for new antibiotics against Gram-negative pathogens. There is, however, increasing concern that this disease entity is too vaguely defined, leading to heterogeneous study populations and risk of bias. We analysed researchers' adherence to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidance on complicated urinary tract infection and assessed risk of bias using a three-step procedure: literature review of full-text articles on complicated urinary tract infection; assessment of the importance of risk factors for treatment failure, including statistical evaluation of how patients with risk factors might skew treatment effects; and a Delphi consensus process in a multidisciplinary group. Our evaluation showed poor adherence to FDA guidance on complicated urinary tract infection and significant heterogeneity in the reporting of study, patient, and pathogen characteristics, leading to a high risk of bias when interpreting and comparing study findings. We therefore question the concept of complicated urinary tract infection as a meaningful entity with its own study guidance.

### Role of antibiotic resistance in urinary tract infection management: a cost-effectiveness analysis [^114SJE14]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infections and recurrent urinary tract infections pose substantial burdens on patients and healthcare systems. Testing and treatment strategies are increasingly important in the age of antibiotic resistance and stewardship.

Objective

This study aimed to evaluate the cost effectiveness of urinary tract infection testing and treatment strategies with a focus on antibiotic resistance.

Study Design

We designed a decision tree to model the following 4 strategies for managing urinary tract infections: (1) empirical antibiotics first, followed by culture-directed antibiotics if symptoms persist; (2) urine culture first, followed by culture-directed antibiotics; (3) urine culture at the same time as empirical antibiotics, followed by culture-directed antibiotics, if symptoms persist; and (4) symptomatic treatment first, followed by culture-directed antibiotics, if symptoms persist. To model both patient- and society-level concerns, we built 3 versions of this model with different outcome measures: quality-adjusted life-years, symptom-free days, and antibiotic courses given. Societal cost of antibiotic resistance was modeled for each course of antibiotics given. The probability of urinary tract infection and the level of antibiotic resistance were modeled from 0% to 100%. We also extended the model to account for patients requiring catheterization for urine specimen collection.

Results

In our model, the antibiotic resistance rate was based either on the local antibiotic resistance patterns for patients presenting with sporadic urinary tract infections or on rate of resistance from prior urine cultures for patients with recurrent urinary tract infections. With the base case assumption of 20% antibiotic resistance, urine culture at the same time as empirical antibiotics was the most cost-effective strategy and maximized symptom-free days. However, empirical antibiotics was the most cost-effective strategy when antibiotic resistance was below 6%, whereas symptomatic treatment was the most cost-effective strategy when antibiotic resistance was above 80%. To minimize antibiotic use, symptomatic treatment first was always the best strategy followed by urine culture first. Sensitivity analyses with other input parameters did not affect the cost-effectiveness results. When we extended the model to include an office visit for catheterized urine specimens, empirical antibiotics became the most cost-effective option.

Conclusion

We developed models for urinary tract infection management strategies that can be interpreted for patients initially presenting with urinary tract infections or those with recurrent urinary tract infections. Our results suggest that, in most cases, urine culture at the same time as empirical antibiotics is the most cost-effective strategy and maximizes symptom-free days. Empirical antibiotics first should only be considered if the expected antibiotic resistance is very low. If antibiotic resistance is expected to be very high, symptomatic treatment is the best strategy and minimizes antibiotic use.

### The diagnosis and treatment of adult urinary tract infections in the emergency department [^115d1h84]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Emergency medicine has been called the art of "making complicated clinical decisions with limited information". This description is particularly relevant in the case of diagnosis and treatment of urinary tract infections (UTIs). Although common, UTIs are often challenging to diagnose given the presence of non-specific signs and symptoms and over-reliance on laboratory findings. This review provides an interdisciplinary interpretation of the primary literature and practice guidelines, with a focus on diagnostic and antimicrobial stewardship in the emergency department.

### Which treatment strategy for women with symptoms of urinary tract infection? [^111osZb9]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

In patients with severe and persistent symptoms, microbiological examination of urine can help the GP to identify the micro-organisms causing the infection. In Nordic countries, many GPs have direct access to point of care testing such as urine phase contrast microscopy, culture, and direct susceptibility testing to identify patients who need antibiotic treatment. In the study by Gágyor and colleagues, only a third of patients with uncomplicated UTI needed antibiotics during the four weeks of follow-up, so a strategy of delayed prescription for patients with light to moderate symptoms might also be a feasible strategy. We need trials of delayed prescriptions for UTI. Delayed prescribing has been shown to reduce antibiotic prescriptions for respiratory tract infections by 50–70%.(this is same sentence repeated in adifferent way!)

### Recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline [^114AqSwd]. The Journal of Urology (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

This document seeks to establish guidance for the evaluation and management of women with recurrent urinary tract infections (rUTI) to prevent inappropriate use of antibiotics, decrease the risk of antibiotic resistance, reduce adverse effects of antibiotic use, provide guidance on antibiotic and non-antibiotic strategies for prevention, and improve clinical outcomes and quality of life by reducing recurrence of urinary tract infection (UTI) events.

Materials and Methods

The systematic review utilized to inform this guideline was conducted by a methodology team at the Pacific Northwest Evidence-based Practice Center. A research librarian conducted searches in Ovid MEDLINE (1946 to January Week 1 2018), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (through December 2017) and Embase (through January 16, 2018). An update literature search was conducted on September 20, 2018.

Results

When sufficient evidence existed, the body of evidence was assigned a strength rating of A (high), B (moderate), or C (low). Such evidence-based statements are provided as Strong, Moderate, or Conditional Recommendations. In instances of insufficient evidence, additional guidance is provided as Clinical Principles and Expert Opinions.

Conclusions

Our ability to diagnose, treat, and manage rUTI long-term has evolved due to additional insights into the pathophysiology of rUTI, a new appreciation for the adverse effects of repetitive antimicrobial therapy, rising rates of bacterial antimicrobial resistance (AMR), and better reporting of the natural history and clinical outcomes of acute cystitis and rUTI. As new data continue to emerge in this space, this document will undergo review to ensure continued accuracy.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of asymptomatic bacteriuria: 2019 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^113QNgjh]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Bacteriuria at catheter removal — evidence and rationale: one randomized controlled trial (RCT) in women reported 7 of 41 (17%) randomized to no treatment developed symptomatic UTI within 14 days, while 15 (36%) had spontaneous clearance of bacteriuria, with enrollment limited to those with a negative urine culture at insertion, no antimicrobial therapy while the catheter remained in situ, and bacteriuria at removal persisting 48 hours; a meta-analysis including 6 studies (5 surgical) initiated antimicrobials upon catheter removal irrespective of ASB and found benefit on subsequent UTI over 1 to 6 weeks with RD, –65/1000 [95% CI, –96 to –33], though studies were heterogeneous with high risk of selection and attrition bias; the rationale states, "We make a strong recommendation because there is very low certainty of any benefit and high-quality evidence of harm", and that there are no studies generalizable to current practice addressing screening for or treating ASB at catheter removal.

### Antibiotic overprescription for "Urinary tract infections" is associated with poor diagnostic stewardship and low adherence to guidelines [^113AAffU]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2025). Medium credibility.

5 Conclusions

Our data continue to support evidence that UTIs are often diagnosed and treated in a manner inconsistent with guidelines meant to direct best clinical practices. Laboratory tests are frequently used in the absence of urinary symptoms demonstrating inappropriate testing. Over‐testing is contributing to the overtreatment of patients without UTI symptoms and often without microbiological evidence of infection. Given the potential harms of overtreatment such as antibiotic resistance, recurrent infections, and high healthcare costs, our study demonstrates the need for advances in adherence to and understanding of UTI diagnostic criteria and treatment guidelines as well as improved diagnostic and antimicrobial stewardship.

### Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI): clinical guidelines for treatment and management [^116uTTsD]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) empiric therapy — process to guide choice proposes a four-step approach that includes assessing severity of illness for initial prioritization, considering patient-specific risk factors for resistant uropathogens to optimize coverage, evaluating other patient-specific considerations to reduce adverse events, and for patients with sepsis, consulting a relevant local antibiogram if available.

### Guidelines for the prevention, diagnosis, and management of urinary tract infections in pediatrics and adults: a WikiGuidelines group consensus statement [^1122dnZP]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Importance

Traditional approaches to practice guidelines frequently result in dissociation between strength of recommendation and quality of evidence.

Objective

To create a clinical guideline for the diagnosis and management of urinary tract infections that addresses the gap between the evidence and recommendation strength.

Evidence Review

This consensus statement and systematic review applied an approach previously established by the WikiGuidelines Group to construct collaborative clinical guidelines. In May 2023, new and existing members were solicited for questions on urinary tract infection prevention, diagnosis, and management. For each topic, literature searches were conducted up until early 2024 in any language. Evidence was reported according to the WikiGuidelines charter: clear recommendations were established only when reproducible, prospective, controlled studies provided hypothesis-confirming evidence. In the absence of such data, clinical reviews were developed discussing the available literature and associated risks and benefits of various approaches.

Findings

A total of 54 members representing 12 countries reviewed 914 articles and submitted information relevant to 5 sections: prophylaxis and prevention (7 questions), diagnosis and diagnostic stewardship (7 questions), empirical treatment (3 questions), definitive treatment and antimicrobial stewardship (10 questions), and special populations and genitourinary syndromes (10 questions). Of 37 unique questions, a clear recommendation could be provided for 6 questions. In 3 of the remaining questions, a clear recommendation could only be provided for certain aspects of the question. Clinical reviews were generated for the remaining questions and aspects of questions not meeting criteria for a clear recommendation.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this consensus statement that applied the WikiGuidelines method for clinical guideline development, the majority of topics relating to prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of urinary tract infections lack high-quality prospective data and clear recommendations could not be made. Randomized clinical trials are underway to address some of these gaps; however further research is of utmost importance to inform true evidence-based, rather than eminence-based practice.

### Development of quality indicators for the antibiotic treatment of complicated urinary tract infections: a first step to measure and improve care [^111GMWUv]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Appropriateness of antibiotic treatment of urinary tract infection (UTI) is important. The aim of this study was to develop a set of valid, reliable, and applicable indicators to assess the quality of antibiotic use in the treatment of hospitalized patients with complicated UTI.

Methods

A multidisciplinary panel of 13 experts reviewed and prioritized recommendations extracted from a recently developed evidence-based national guideline for the treatment of complicated UTI. The content validity was assessed in 2 consecutive rounds with an in-between discussion meeting. Next, we tested the feasibility, interobserver reliability, opportunity for improvement, and case-mix stability of the potential indicators for a data set of 341 inpatients and outpatients with complicated UTIs who were treated at the urology or internal medicine departments at 4 hospitals.

Results

The panel selected and prioritized 13 indicators. Four and 9 indicators were performed satisfactorily in the urology and internal medicine departments, as follows: performance of urine culture, prescription of treatment in accordance with guidelines, tailoring of treatment on the basis of culture results, and a switch to oral treatment when possible in the urology and internal medicine departments; and selective use of fluoroquinolones, administration of treatment for at least 10 days, prescription of treatment for men in accordance with guidelines, replacement of catheters in patients with UTI, and adaptation of the dosage on the basis of renal function in the internal medicine department.

Conclusion

A systemic evidence- and consensus-based approach was used to develop a set of valid quality indicators. Tests of the applicability of these indicators in practice in different settings is essential before they are used in quality-improvement strategies.

### Effectiveness of five different approaches in management of urinary tract infection: randomised controlled trial [^115qQwRP]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Urinary tract infections are one of the most common conditions seen in female patients in general practice. These infections affect 50% of women at least once in their lives, and more than 20% of infections are resistant to trimethoprim and cephalosporins and 50% to amoxicillin.

Urinary dipsticks are the most commonly used near patient test in primary care in the United Kingdom. The aim of using dipsticks is to target treatment to the 60% of women who have urinary tract infections, while minimising antibiotic use for women without infection. A previous validation study has shown that dipsticks and clinical scoring algorithms can potentially help improve the precision of diagnosis by improving the positive predictive values. If clinicians are to use dipsticks, however, they need to have strategies to deal with the poor negative predictive values. We know of no trial that has assessed dipstick or clinical management algorithms in comparison with the realistic alternatives. Previous studies have documented that delayed antibiotic prescribing in respiratory infections results in good symptom control, reduced belief in the effectiveness of antibiotics, and fewer repeat consultations. We hypothesised that, compared with an immediate antibiotic prescription, other management strategies would result in worse symptom control, particularly in women asked to delay antibiotics empirically or while waiting for the result of midstream urine analysis.

We aimed to assess the effectiveness of management using dipstick or clinical algorithms compared with the alternative management strategies (empirical antibiotic treatment, delayed prescribing, and targeted prescribing based on midstream urine results).

### An update on uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women [^11321799]. Current Opinion in Urology (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) in women comprise uncomplicated and complicated UTIs. Uncomplicated UTIs, such as acute uncomplicated cystitis and pyelonephritis, are very common infections in otherwise healthy women, with a high tendency to recur. Although severe complications are rare, their high prevalence causes remarkable costs in the healthcare systems.

Recent Findings

As most scientific evidence has been gathered in uncomplicated UTI, this study focuses on recent developments in epidemiology, pathogenesis, cause, diagnosis, treatment and prevention of uncomplicated UTI and recurrent UTI in women.

Summary

A remarkable increase of antibiotic resistance is also noted in uncomplicated UTI. Therefore, prudent use of antibiotic substances in uncomplicated UTI is increasingly important.

### Symptomatic treatment (ibuprofen) or antibiotics (ciprofloxacin) for uncomplicated urinary tract infection? – results of a randomized controlled pilot trial [^114oECXX]. BMC Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Methods

Study design and population

This was a double-blind, randomized controlled equivalence trial, conducted between July 2007 and April 2008. Twenty-nine of 169 (18%) invited general practitioners (GPs) in Lower Saxony, Germany, agreed to screen and enrol eligible patients for a six-month-period. All adult women (> 18 ys) suspected to have uncomplicated UTI due to typical symptoms (dysuria and/or frequency) and not having any exclusion criteria were to be asked for informed consent to be enrolled successively. Exclusion criteria were, comparable with other UTI trials, any signs evoking complicated UTI (that is, fever, back pain), any conditions that may lead to complicated infections (that is, pregnancy, diabetes, renal diseases, urinary tract abnormalities or past urinary surgery, urine catheterization, immunosuppressive therapy, other serious diseases, cancer), UTI within the last two weeks, current use of antibiotics or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs; history of gastrointestinal ulcers; epilepsy, allergies or other contraindications for trial drugs; current participation in other clinical trials, disability to understand the trial information or to give informed consent. Dipstick results were not required for inclusion.

### Efficacy and safety of individualised versus standard 10-day antibiotic treatment in children with febrile urinary tract infection (INDI-UTI): a pragmatic, open-label, multicentre, randomised, controlled, non-inferiority trial in Denmark [^112amWAz]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Background

The optimal antibiotic duration for febrile urinary tract infection (UTI) in children remains uncertain. We aimed to assess whether individualised treatment was non-inferior to standard 10-day treatment in terms of recurrent UTI and superior in reducing overall antibiotic exposure.

Methods

INDI-UTI was a pragmatic, open-label, multicentre, randomised, controlled, non-inferiority trial conducted at eight Danish hospitals. Children aged 3 months to 12 years who were febrile (≥ 38°C), within 24 h of treatment start, and with significant growth of uropathogenic bacteria were randomly assigned (1:1) using a web-based module with randomly permuted blocks to individualised or standard 10-day treatment. Main exclusion criteria included known urinary tract abnormalities, complicated medical history, bacteraemia, and elevated serum creatinine. The individualised group stopped treatment 3 days after adequate clinical improvement (ie, absence of fever, flank pain, and dysuria), with a minimum treatment duration of 4 days. The primary outcomes were recurrent UTI within 28 days after treatment cessation (non-inferiority margin 7.5 percentage points) and total antibiotic days within 28 days of treatment initiation (superiority assessment). No sample size calculation was performed for the assessment of total antibiotic days. Safety was assessed in all included patients. Main analyses were done in the intention-to-treat population. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT05301023.

Findings

Between March 28, 2022, and March 3, 2024, 694 patients were assessed for eligibility and 408 patients were randomly assigned to individualised (n = 205; median antibiotic duration 5.3 days [IQR 4.8 to 6.5]) or standard 10-day treatment (n = 203; 10.0 days [10.0 to 10.0]). Median age was 1.5 years (IQR 0.7 to 5.4), and there were 326 (80%) female and 82 (20%) male participants. Recurrent UTI within 28 days occurred in 23 (11%) of 205 patients in the individualised group and 12 (6%) of 203 patients in the standard 10-day group (difference 5.3 percentage points, one-sided 97.5% CI -∞ to 11.1, p non_inferiority = 0.24). Total antibiotic days within 28 days were 6.0 (IQR 5.3 to 7.5) in the individualised group and 10.0 (10.0 to 10.0) in the standard 10-day group (median difference -4.0 days [97.5% CI -4.5 to -3.7], p < 0.0001). The incidence rate of antibiotic-related adverse events within 28 days was 6.8 per 100 patient-days in the individualised group and 11.1 per 100 patient-days in the standard 10-day group (rate ratio 0.61 [95% CI 0.47 to 0.80], p = 0.0003). Serious adverse events occurred in 17 (8%) of 205 patients in the individualised group and 15 (7%) of 203 patients in the standard 10-day group (difference 0.9 percentage points [95% CI -4.6 to 6.5], p = 0.79).

Interpretation

Children with febrile UTI assigned to individualised treatment duration had an increased risk of recurrent UTI (by 5.3 percentage points) but reduced antibiotic use and fewer adverse event days within 28 days compared with those assigned to standard 10-day treatment. These findings highlight the potential of individualised treatment strategies to reduce antibiotic exposure and associated harms in most children with febrile UTI, supporting antimicrobial stewardship goals. Further research is needed to identify those requiring 10-day treatment to avoid compromising care for most children with febrile UTI who respond well to shorter durations.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of asymptomatic bacteriuria: 2019 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^11183VFt]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria — general risk–benefit rationale outside pregnancy: Although women with ASB may also be at increased risk of symptomatic urinary tract infection (UTI), ASB, even when persistent, appears not to be associated with other adverse outcomes, and there is no evidence to suggest that episodes of symptomatic UTI are attributable to the ASB. Moreover, treatment of ASB may not decrease the frequency of symptomatic UTI, including pyelonephritis, and antibiotics may increase rather than decrease the risk of subsequent UTI. There is high-quality evidence that antibiotics have an increased risk of adverse effects, that screening and treating ASB is extremely costly, and that the use of antibiotics promotes emergence of antimicrobial resistance.

### Antimicrobial agents for treating uncomplicated urinary tract infection in women [^114PmJ6k]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Acute uncomplicated lower urinary tract infection (UTI) is one of the most common problems for which young women seek medical attention.

Objectives

To compare the efficacy, resistance development and safety of different antimicrobial treatments for acute uncomplicated lower UTI.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), the Cochrane Renal Group's Specialised Register, MEDLINE, EMBASE and bibliographies of included studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing different classes of antimicrobials for acute uncomplicated UTI in women were included. The outcomes of interest were symptomatic and bacteriological cure at short and long-term follow-up, resistance development, number of days to symptom resolution, days of work loss, adverse events and complications.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently extracted the data and assessed study quality. Statistical analyses were performed using the random effects model and the results expressed as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) was as effective as fluoroquinolones in achieving short-term (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.03) and long-term (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.05) symptomatic cure. Beta-lactam drugs were as effective as TMP-SMX for short-term (RR 0.95' 95% CI 0.81 to 1.12) and long-term (RR 1.06' 95% CI 0.93 to 1.21) symptomatic cure. Short-term cure for nitrofurantoin was similar to that of TMP-SMX (RR 0.99' 95% CI 0.95 to 1.04) as was long-term symptomatic cure (RR 1.01' 95% CI 0.94 to 1.09). Fluoroquinolones were more effective than beta-lactams (RR 1.22, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.31) for short-term bacteriological cure. Rashes were more frequent in patients treated with TMP-SMX than with nitrofurantoin or fluoroquinolones and in patients treated with beta-lactam drugs compared to fluoroquinolones. Minimal data were available on the emergence of resistant strains during or after antimicrobial treatment.

Authors' Conclusions

No differences were observed between the classes of antimicrobials included in this review for the symptomatic cure of acute uncomplicated UTI. Fluoroquinolones proved more effective than beta-lactams for the short-term bacteriological outcome, probably with little clinical significance. Individualised treatment should take into consideration the predictable susceptibility of urinary pathogens in local areas, possible adverse events and resistance development, and patient preference.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a commonly diagnosed infection in older adults. Despite consensus guidelines developed to assist providers in diagnosing UTI, distinguishing symptomatic UTI from asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) in older adults is problematic, as many older adults do not present with localized genitourinary symptoms. This article summarizes the recent literature and guidelines on the diagnosis and management of UTI and ASB in older adults.

### Antibiotic overprescription for "Urinary tract infections" is associated with poor diagnostic stewardship and low adherence to guidelines [^111ag7A6]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

With nearly half of women experiencing a urinary tract infection (UTI) in their lifetime, these infections are one of the leading reasons for antibiotic prescriptions in the United States and worldwide. Despite their clinical ubiquity, physicians exhibit significant variation in their approaches to the workup and treatment of uncomplicated UTIs that may not always follow clinical practice guidelines. Use of unvalidated approaches to the management of UTIs may lead to inaccurate diagnoses and inappropriate antibiotic treatments; prior studies demonstrate that 50%–70% of antibiotic prescriptions for UTI may be inappropriate, which contributes to worsening global rates of antibiotic resistance.

Current treatment guidelines from the American Urological Society (AUA), Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA), and American Geriatrics Society (AGS) agree that UTI diagnosis should be based on clinical symptomology of urinary symptoms (e.g. dysuria, hematuria, urinary frequency, new incontinence in the absence of vaginal symptoms) associated with culture‐proven bacteriuria with a bacterial uropathogen. Rates of asymptomatic bacteriuria range from 1% to 5% in premenopausal women to 16% in older women in the community and as high as 50% for older women in long‐term care facilities, demonstrating why appropriate clinical symptoms are needed to diagnose a UTI.

Prior studies, however, have shown that among patients diagnosed with a UTI in the emergency room (ER), only 32% of adults and 17% of the oldest adults have urinary symptoms, demonstrating poor adherence to current clinical practice guidelines. Patients who have been inappropriately treated with antibiotics for a UTI (e.g. treating those with asymptomatic bacteriuria) have worse outcomes, which may include subsequent infections with multidrug‐resistant organisms or substantial medication side effects. Patients who have an inappropriate initial antibiotic prescription are also subjected to additional drug costs and are at risk of antibiotic switching which can cost up to $2000 more per patient.

Overdiagnosis and overtreatment of UTIs produce worse patient outcomes, increased healthcare costs, and higher societal antibiotic burden. The goals of our study were to evaluate the factors associated with inappropriate diagnosis and treatment of cystitis in the outpatient setting in a set of patients diagnosed with UTI without signs of bacteremia.

Future directions for recurrent urinary tract infection (rUTI) — the guideline highlights that A better understanding of rUTI pathophysiology will greatly aid in our ability to design more effective, mechanistically-based treatments, that Relying on results from the urinary dipstick test, including leukocyte esterase and nitrate, lacks the necessary level of sensitivity and specificity for diagnostic accuracy, and that Currently, there are no symptoms that are definitively predictive of acute cystitis, and no good quality evidence that can support a specific pathogen. It states Urine culture results or any other current methods of bacterial detection do not reflect any aspect of the host response and calls for defining initiatives for algorithms to predict treatment and partnering with our primary care colleagues and patients to provide education regarding rUTI definitions, evaluation, and treatment. It notes Advanced molecular technologies give a more complete characterization of genitourinary microbes and that PCR and NGS-based diagnostic tests have some enticing preliminary studies suggesting their utilization may facilitate equivalent or even better clinical outcomes than standard urine culture while decreasing the time to diagnosis and reducing empiric antibiotic prescriptions, while cautioning These early studies, however, are complicated by some methodological limitations and a high risk of bias and More data are needed before identifying what role these tests play in UTI diagnostics.

### Revised AAP guideline on UTI in febrile infants and young children [^111Z7V9H]. American Family Physician (2012). Low credibility.

In 2011, the American Academy of Pediatrics released a revision of its 1999 clinical practice guideline on urinary tract infections in febrile infants and young children two to 24 months of age. The new clinical practice guideline has several important updates based on evidence generated over the past decade. The updated guideline includes clinical criteria for collecting urine specimens. Diagnosis now requires evidence of infection from both abnormal urinalysis results and positive urine culture results (the criterion for a positive culture has been reduced from at least 100,000 colony-forming units per mL to at least 50,000 colony-forming units per mL). Oral treatment now is considered to be as effective as parenteral treatment. Renal and bladder ultrasonography is still recommended, but the biggest change in the current guideline is that routine voiding cystourethrography is no longer recommended after the first urinary tract infection. Follow-up is based on evaluating children for urinary tract infection during subsequent febrile episodes, rather than routinely performing repeat urine cultures.

Recommendation strength and interpretation using GRADE — All recommendations follow GRADE and are either strong or weak. Recommendations are strong when there is moderate- or high-quality evidence that the desirable consequences outweigh the undesirable consequences for a course of action, and they may also be strong when there is high-quality evidence of harm and benefits are uncertain (ie, low or very low quality). Table 2 provides the suggested interpretation of strong and weak recommendations for patients, clinicians, and healthcare policy makers: for strong recommendations, all or almost all individuals in this situation would want the recommended course of action and only a small proportion would not, all or almost all individuals should receive the intervention, and the recommendation can be adopted as policy in most situations with adherence usable as a quality criterion or performance indicator; for weak (conditional) recommendations, most individuals would probably want the suggested course of action but many would not, clinicians should recognize that fully informed individuals might reasonably choose different courses of action and a shared decision-making process is typically useful to align with values and preferences, and policymaking will require substantial debate and involvement of various stakeholders.

### Urinary tract infections in children: an overview of diagnosis and management [^117EeSio]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2019). High credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a common and potentially serious bacterial infection of childhood. History and examination findings can be non-specific, so a urine sample is required to diagnose UTI. Sample collection in young precontinent children can be challenging. Bedside dipstick tests are useful for screening, but urine culture is required for diagnostic confirmation. Antibiotic therapy must be guided by local guidelines due to increasing antibiotic resistance. Duration of therapy and indications for imaging remain controversial topics and guidelines lack consensus. This article presents an overview of paediatric UTI diagnosis and management, with highlights of recent advances and evidence updates.

Acute uncomplicated urinary tract infection and acute pyelonephritis are very common infections affecting many women throughout their lives. The determinants of infection have been well described and current strategies to prevent recurrent infections are highly effective. While antimicrobial management is straightforward for most episodes, the evolution of antimicrobial susceptibility of E. coli in community-acquired infection requires continuing re-evaluation of appropriate empiric therapy.

Urinary tract infections in male patients share many of the management principles as used in the management of female patients, including the need to accurately define the clinical syndrome, choose empirical therapy based on the severity of illness and the potential for antimicrobial resistance, and consider the need for source control in severely ill patients. The microbiology of the causative organisms is more unpredictable compared to female patients, and data to inform treatment decisions from clinical trials specific to male patients are relatively scarce.

### Antibiotic switches in urinary tract infection are associated with atypical symptoms and emergent care [^116bEBSt]. Urogynecology (2024). Medium credibility.

Importance

Given worsening global antibiotic resistance, antimicrobial stewardship aims to use the shortest effective duration of the most narrow-spectrum, effective antibiotic for patients with specific urinary symptoms and laboratory testing consistent with urinary tract infection (UTI). Inappropriate treatment and unnecessary antibiotic switching for UTIs harms patients in a multitude of ways.

Objective

This study sought to analyze antibiotic treatment failures as measured by antibiotic switching for treatment of UTI in emergent and ambulatory care.

Study Design

For this retrospective cohort study, 908 encounters during July 2019 bearing a diagnostic code for UTI/cystitis in a single health care system were reviewed. Urinary and microbiological testing, symptoms endorsed at presentation, and treatments prescribed were extracted from the medical record.

Results

Of 908 patients diagnosed with UTI, 64% of patients (579/908) received antibiotics, 86% of which were empiric. All patients evaluated in emergent care settings were prescribed antibiotics empirically in contrast to 71% of patients in ambulatory settings (P < 0.001). Of patients given antibiotics, 89 of 579 patients (15%, 10% of all 908 patients) were switched to alternative antibiotics within 28 days. Emergent care settings and positive urine cultures were significantly associated with increased antibiotic switching. Patients subjected to switching tended to have higher rates of presenting symptoms inconsistent with UTI.

Conclusions

Empiric treatment, particularly in an emergent care setting, was frequently inappropriate and associated with increasing rates of antibiotic switching. Given the profound potential contribution to antibiotic resistance, these findings highlight the need for improved diagnostic and prescribing accuracy for UTI.

Patient-specific risk factors for resistant uropathogens — recent antibiotic class exposure: In patients with complicated UTI (including acute pyelonephritis), we suggest avoiding fluoroquinolones if the patient has been exposed to that class of antibiotic in the past 12 months (conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence). Remarks note that more recent antibiotic exposure may be a better guide than more distant antibiotic exposure.

Short-course therapy for uncomplicated acute UTI — Three-day regimens of TMP-SMX and fluoroquinolones have comparable effectiveness with 79%–100% and 85%–98% cure rates and are widely accepted when there are no complicating factors. These regimens are as effective for symptomatic relief as longer 5- to 10-day regimens and have improved compliance, decreased costs, and lower adverse reaction rates. The efficacy of 5 days of nitrofurantoin is comparable to 3 days of TMP-SMX, and five days of nitrofurantoin has better efficacy than a 3-day regimen.

### Effect of 7 vs 14 days of antibiotic therapy on resolution of symptoms among afebrile men with urinary tract infection: a randomized clinical trial [^1171F9GK]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Determination of optimal treatment durations for common infectious diseases is an important strategy to preserve antibiotic effectiveness.

Objective

To determine whether 7 days of treatment is noninferior to 14 days when using ciprofloxacin or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole to treat urinary tract infection (UTI) in afebrile men.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled noninferiority trial of afebrile men with presumed symptomatic UTI treated with ciprofloxacin or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole at 2 US Veterans Affairs medical centers (enrollment, April 2014 through December 2019; final follow-up, January 28, 2020). Of 1058 eligible men, 272 were randomized.

Interventions

Participants continued the antibiotic prescribed by their treating clinician for 7 days of treatment and were randomized to receive continued antibiotic therapy (n = 136) or placebo (n = 136) for days 8 to 14 of treatment.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The prespecified primary outcome was resolution of UTI symptoms by 14 days after completion of active antibiotic treatment. A noninferiority margin of 10% was selected. The as-treated population (participants who took ≥ 26 of 28 doses and missed no more than 2 consecutive doses) was used for the primary analysis, and a secondary analysis included all patients as randomized, regardless of treatment adherence. Secondary outcomes included recurrence of UTI symptoms and/or adverse events within 28 days of stopping study medication.

Results

Among 272 patients (median [interquartile range] age, 69 [62–73] years) who were randomized, 100% completed the trial and 254 (93.4%) were included in the primary as-treated analysis. Symptom resolution occurred in 122/131 (93.1%) participants in the 7-day group vs 111/123 (90.2%) in the 14-day group (difference, 2.9% [1-sided 97.5% CI, -5.2% to ∞]), meeting the noninferiority criterion. In the secondary as-randomized analysis, symptom resolution occurred in 125/136 (91.9%) participants in the 7-day group vs 123/136 (90.4%) in the 14-day group (difference, 1.5% [1-sided 97.5% CI, -5.8% to ∞]) Recurrence of UTI symptoms occurred in 13/131 (9.9%) participants in the 7-day group vs 15/123 (12.9%) in the 14-day group (difference, -3.0% [95% CI, -10.8% to 6.2%]; p = 0.70). Adverse events occurred in 28/136 (20.6%) participants in the 7-day group vs 33/136 (24.3%) in the 14-day group.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among afebrile men with suspected UTI, treatment with ciprofloxacin or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole for 7 days was noninferior to 14 days of treatment with regard to resolution of UTI symptoms by 14 days after antibiotic therapy. The findings support the use of a 7-day course of ciprofloxacin or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole as an alternative to a 14-day course for treatment of afebrile men with UTI.

### Alternative to prophylactic antibiotics for the treatment of recurrent urinary tract infections in women: multicentre, open label, randomised, non-inferiority trial [^115mVcrU]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

For the primary outcome, the incidence rate in each group was the total number of UTI episodes divided by the total follow-up (exposure) time, reported with 95% confidence intervals calculated using a resampling procedure (bootstrap). The absolute difference between groups was calculated and reported with a 90% bootstrap confidence interval. Non-inferiority would be concluded if the upper limit of the confidence interval was below one UTI episode/year. We estimated relative treatment differences using a negative binomial model with follow-up time included as an exposure variable, recruiting centre as a random effect, and baseline stratification factors (menopausal status and prior UTI frequency) as fixed effects. This model yielded an estimate of the incidence rate ratio, presented with a 95% confidence interval.

Sensitivity analyses excluded days when participants took therapeutic antibiotics for UTI from the follow-up time. We analysed a binary indicator of at least one UTI episode using a mixed effects logistic regression model adjusted for centre and baseline stratification factors. Analyses were primarily conducted in a modified intention-to-treat population, which included all participants observed for at least six months, because these participants were assumed to provide a reliable estimate of UTI incidence. Prespecified sensitivity analyses were conducted in intention-to-treat and per protocol populations (participants achieving ≥ 90% adherence with preventive treatment; switching between treatment strategies was considered adherent). We also conducted a post hoc sensitivity analysis in a strict per protocol population that included only those participants achieving ≥ 90% adherence with initially randomised treatment.

Symptomatically diagnosed UTI incidence in the post-treatment period and microbiologically confirmed UTIs were analysed as for the primary outcome measure. Secondary outcomes were analysed according to the intention-to-treat principle and included all participants with data available. Rates of asymptomatic bacteriuria and antibiotic resistance were compared by χ² or Fisher's exact tests. These analyses are considered exploratory and should be interpreted with caution. We made no adjustments for multiple testing. Domain scores of the treatment satisfaction questionnaire for drug treatment were compared between groups using a two sample t test and an analysis of covariance model adjusted for baseline stratification factors. To account for switching between treatment strategies, adverse events were reported according to treatment received at the time with data summarised by numbers of participants receiving each intervention. All analyses were conducted using Stata version 16. Independent trial steering and data monitoring committees had oversight throughout the trial. The trial was registered with the ISRCTN registry (ISRCTN70219762).

### Acute uncomplicated UTIs in adults: rapid evidence review [^1132xnmk]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

An acute uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI) is a bacterial infection of the lower urinary tract with no sign of systemic illness or pyelonephritis in a noncatheterized, nonpregnant adult with no urologic abnormalities or immunocompromise. In women, a self-diagnosis of a UTI with the presence of typical symptoms (e.g., frequency, urgency, dysuria/burning sensation, nocturia, suprapubic pain), without vaginal discharge, is accurate enough to diagnose an uncomplicated UTI without further testing. Urine culture and susceptibility testing should be reserved for women with recurrent infection, treatment failure, history of resistant isolates, or atypical presentation to make a definitive diagnosis and guide antibiotic selection. First-line antibiotics include nitrofurantoin for five days, fosfomycin in a single dose, trimethoprim for three days, or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole for three days. Symptomatic treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and delayed antibiotics may be considered because the risk of complications is low. Increased fluids, intake of cranberry products, and methenamine hippurate can prevent recurrent infections. Antibiotic prophylaxis is also effective in preventing recurrence but has a risk of adverse effects and antimicrobial resistance. Men with lower UTI symptoms should always receive antibiotics, with urine culture and susceptibility results guiding the antibiotic choice. Clinicians should also consider the possibility of urethritis and prostatitis in men with UTI symptoms. First-line antibiotics for men with uncomplicated UTI include trimethoprim, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and nitrofurantoin for seven days. Uncomplicated UTIs in nonfrail women and men 65 years and older with no relevant comorbidities also necessitate a urine culture with susceptibility testing to adjust the antibiotic choice after initial empiric treatment; first-line antibiotics and treatment durations do not differ from those recommended for younger adults.

### Clinical management of an increasing threat: outpatient urinary tract infections due to multidrug-resistant uropathogens [^115H9zXq]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are among the most commonly treated bacterial infections. Over the past decade, antimicrobial resistance has become an increasingly common factor in the management of outpatient UTIs. As treatment options for multidrug-resistant (MDR) uropathogens are limited, clinicians need to be aware of specific clinical and epidemiological risk factors for these infections. Based on available literature, the activity of fosfomycin and nitrofurantoin remain high for most cases of MDR Escherichia coli UTIs. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole retains clinical efficacy, but resistance rates are increasing internationally. Beta-lactam agents have the highest rates of resistance and lowest rates of clinical success. Fluoroquinolones have high resistance rates among MDR uropathogens and are being strongly discouraged as first-line agents for UTIs. In addition to accounting for local resistance rates, consideration of patient risk factors for resistance and pharmacological principles will help guide optimal empiric treatment of outpatient UTIs.

### Treatment duration of febrile urinary tract infection: a pragmatic randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled non-inferiority trial in men and women [^113BEzPi]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Main outcome measures

The primary endpoint was the clinical cure rate through the 10- to 18-day post-treatment visit (short-term clinical cure). Clinical cure was defined as being alive with absence of fever and resolution of UTI symptoms (either absence of symptoms or at least 2 points improvement on a 0–5 point severity score scale), without additional antimicrobial therapy (for relapse of UTI). Secondary outcome measures were bacteriological cure through the 10- to 18-day post-treatment visit, clinical cure rate through the 70- to 84-day post-treatment visit (cumulative clinical cure), all-cause mortality, adverse event rate determined at 10–18 days and 70–84 days post-treatment, and rate of UTI relapses. In addition, outcome measures were analyzed as stratified by specific predefined subgroups (men, patients with complicated UTI, older age, patients with bacteremic UTI). Bacteriologic cure was defined as eradication of the study entry uropathogen with no recurrence of bacteriuria (pathogen growth < 10⁴ CFU/mL in women or < 10³ CFU/mL in men of a midstream urine culture combined with disappearance of leucocyturia).

### American Urogynecologic Society best-practice statement: recurrent urinary tract infection in adult women [^1146BbVG]. Female Pelvic Medicine & Reconstructive Surgery (2018). Medium credibility.

Recurrent urinary tract infection (rUTI) — definitions and terminology state that a commonly used definition describes urinary tract infection (UTI) as an infection of the lower and/or upper genitourinary tract which is diagnosed based on the presence of a pathogen in the urinary tract and associated symptoms, with limited evidence to support any "gold standard" UTI definition for epidemiologic or clinical research; this statement endorses a clinically useful, culture-based definition for rUTI of at least 2 culture-proven episodes in 6 months, or at least 3 in 1 year, and distinguishes relapse as UTI symptoms with the same uropathogen within 2 weeks of completing appropriate antibiotic therapy versus recurrence beyond the initial 2 weeks or with a different uropathogen.

### Diagnosis and management of uncomplicated urinary tract infections [^1156Fvm4]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Most uncomplicated urinary tract infections occur in women who are sexually active, with far fewer cases occurring in older women, those who are pregnant, and in men. Although the incidence of urinary tract infection has not changed substantially over the last 10 years, the diagnostic criteria, bacterial resistance patterns, and recommended treatment have changed. Escherichia coli is the leading cause of urinary tract infections, followed by Staphylococcus saprophyticus. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole has been the standard therapy for urinary tract infection; however, E. coli is becoming increasingly resistant to medications. Many experts support using ciprofloxacin as an alternative and, in some cases, as the preferred first-line agent. However, others caution that widespread use of ciprofloxacin will promote increased resistance.

### Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI): clinical guidelines for treatment and management [^116E3Bvt]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) with sepsis — antibiogram to tailor empiric therapy: In patients with sepsis assumed to be caused by complicated UTI (including acute pyelonephritis), we suggest using an antibiogram to further tailor empiric antibiotic choice only if the antibiogram is local, recent, and relevant to the patient (conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence). An antibiogram is considered local if derived from the same healthcare facility, recent if based on data from the prior 12 months and relevant to the patient if based on organisms from a similar patient population. If an antibiogram is being used to further tailor empirical antibiotic choice, consider selecting an antibiotic for which 90% or more of the most relevant organism(s) are susceptible in patients in septic shock, or for which 80% or more of the most relevant organism(s) are susceptible in patients with sepsis without shock; these cutoffs are based on modeling of increased mortality risk associated with inappropriate empiric antibiotics in sepsis and septic shock. Septic shock is defined by the Sepsis-3 Task Force as a subset of sepsis in which despite volume resuscitation, vasopressors are required to maintain blood pressure and serum lactate level is greater than 2 mmol/L, reflecting an in-hospital mortality greater than 40%.

- **UTI Symptom**: dysuria
- **UTI Symptoms**: urinary urgency, urinary frequency, and dysuria
- Costovertebral angle pain or tenderness
- Suprapubic tenderness and "With no other recognized cause". UTI Symptom: dysuria Urinary retention is not the same as dysuria and cannot be used to meet the UTI definition. Dysuria is defined as painful or uncomfortable urination. UTI Symptoms: urinary urgency, urinary frequency, and dysuria No, "with no other recognized cause" does not apply to these symptoms. In the presence of a positive urine culture which may have been collected as a differential diagnosis for suspicion of UTI, it would be very rare that there is another associated cause for urinary urgency, urinary frequency and dysuria which are hallmark UTI symptoms. Yes.

If the patient's urinary urgency, urinary frequency, or dysuria occurred when the indwelling urinary catheter was not in place at the time the patient experienced the urinary urgency, urinary frequency, or dysuria, then the urinary urgency, urinary frequency, or dysuria can be used as an element to meet NHSN UTI criteria, even on a day when the was in place for part of the day. ABUTI and CMS Only catheter-associated UTI data are shared with CMS. Keep in mind that ABUTI may occur in patients with or without an indwelling urinary catheter. Therefore, if a patient in one of these locations has an ABUTI and an indwelling urinary catheter within the timeframe to meet the device-associated rule, this is a CAUTI and is reportable to CMS if CAUTI reporting in the location is included in your monthly reporting plan. Patients with colovesical fistula No.

Patients with colovesical, enterovesical, or rectovesical fistulae are not excluded from meeting the NHSN UTI definition. NHSN surveillance for infection is aimed at identifying risk to the patient that is the result of device use in general, not aimed at a specific device. An indwelling urinary catheter in place puts the patient at risk and, therefore, is included in CAUTI surveillance.
