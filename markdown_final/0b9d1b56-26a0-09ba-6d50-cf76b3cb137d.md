## Question

A 24-year-old woman presents to your clinic with concerns about excessive facial and body hair growth over the past two years. She is otherwise healthy, not sexually active, and has never been pregnant. She is not planning to become sexually active in the near future and has no contraindications to hormonal therapy. She is interested in starting medication for her hirsutism and asks about antiandrogens. She has read online about different antiandrogens, including flutamide, and wonders if she can use one as monotherapy. She is not using any form of contraception.

Based on current guideline recommendations, what is the most appropriate approach to antiandrogen therapy for this patient? Please justify your answer with reference to the guideline's recommendations.

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a 24-year-old woman with hirsutism who is not sexually active and not using contraception can start an antiandrogen such as flutamide as monotherapy, and what the guideline-concordant approach should be. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the teratogenic risk of antiandrogens and how that constrains use. Then, I should verify what major guidelines say about first-line therapy and when antiandrogens are appropriate. Next, I will examine the specific safety concerns with flutamide and whether any exception applies here. Finally, I will outline a practical, evidence-based plan and confirm the counseling points and monitoring needs, including the 6-month timeline for response and contraception requirements if antiandrogens are used.

> Let me first confirm the core safety issue: all antiandrogens are teratogenic and can feminize a male fetus, so effective contraception is mandatory whenever they are used in women who could become pregnant, regardless of current sexual activity or plans, because plans can change and ovulation can precede a first period after starting therapy [^1164uEVK] [^1163J78f] [^112tApJQ].

> Wait, let me verify the guideline stance on first-line therapy. The Endocrine Society recommends combined oral contraceptives as initial pharmacologic therapy for most premenopausal women with patient-important hirsutism, with antiandrogens reserved for inadequate response after 6 months or for those using reliable contraception, and they explicitly recommend against antiandrogen monotherapy as initial therapy unless adequate contraception is in place [^115F4Jo5] [^1176VPYr] [^115FrRWw].

> Hold on, I should verify the specific warning about flutamide. The Endocrine Society advises against flutamide because of dose-dependent hepatotoxicity; even though it can reduce hirsutism, the liver risk and need for periodic liver function monitoring make it a poor choice compared with alternatives like spironolactone or finasteride, and this risk-benefit calculus does not change just because the patient is not currently sexually active [^115F4Jo5] [^111rgwQd] [^114Po2jr].

> I need to check whether any exception allows antiandrogen monotherapy without contraception. The Endocrine Society notes that women who are not sexually active, sterilized, or using long-acting reversible contraception may choose either OCs or antiandrogens as initial therapy, but that choice still hinges on reliable contraception if an antiandrogen is selected; thus, even in a non–sexually active patient, antiandrogen monotherapy is not appropriate without assured contraception, and flutamide remains discouraged due to hepatotoxicity [^115F4Jo5] [^111uHyNz] [^1163J78f].

> Let me consider the practical, guideline-concordant plan. First-line therapy should be a combined oral contraceptive to suppress ovarian androgens, increase SHBG, and regulate menses; if hirsutism remains after a 6-month trial, add an antiandrogen such as spironolactone 50–100 mg twice daily, and ensure effective contraception before starting the antiandrogen; finasteride is a reasonable alternative if spironolactone is not tolerated, but again, contraception is mandatory and flutamide should be avoided [^115F4Jo5] [^112tApJQ] [^112LFVHi].

> I should double-check the counseling points. Patients need to understand that pharmacologic effects on hair growth lag because of the hair cycle, so a minimum 6-month trial is required before changing dose or switching agents; if an antiandrogen is used, counsel on teratogenic risk and confirm a reliable contraceptive method even if the patient is not currently sexually active; monitor for spironolactone effects such as diuresis, hypotension, and hyperkalemia, and consider checking potassium if there are comorbidities affecting renal function or if higher doses are used [^115F4Jo5] [^115FrRWw] [^11448eMq].

> But wait, what if the patient insists on starting an antiandrogen now without any contraception? I should confirm that this would be outside guideline recommendations; the appropriate response is to prioritize OCs first and, if antiandrogen therapy is later indicated, to coordinate contraception before initiation, documenting shared decision-making and the rationale for avoiding flutamide given hepatotoxicity and the availability of safer alternatives [^115F4Jo5] [^111rgwQd].

> In summary, I should conclude clearly: no, antiandrogen monotherapy — especially flutamide — is not appropriate for this patient because she lacks reliable contraception and because flutamide carries unacceptable hepatotoxic risk. The guideline-concordant approach is to start a combined oral contraceptive, reassess at 6 months, and if hirsutism persists, add a safer antiandrogen such as spironolactone with guaranteed contraception, while avoiding flutamide altogether [^115F4Jo5] [^112tApJQ] [^111rgwQd].

---

Antiandrogen monotherapy is **not recommended** for this patient because of the teratogenic risk of antiandrogens [^115F4Jo5] and the need for reliable contraception [^115FrRWw]. Current guidelines recommend **combined oral contraceptives (COCs) as first-line therapy** [^115F4Jo5] for hirsutism, with antiandrogens added only if response is inadequate after 6 months [^112tApJQ] and only with effective contraception [^115FrRWw]. Flutamide is specifically discouraged due to hepatotoxicity [^115F4Jo5] [^111rgwQd]. If the patient strongly prefers antiandrogen monotherapy, she must use reliable contraception (e.g. LARC) [^111uHyNz] and understand the risks; spironolactone is the preferred antiandrogen [^114Po2jr] [^1164uEVK].

---

## Guideline recommendations on antiandrogen monotherapy

The Endocrine Society (ES) 2018 guideline provides **clear guidance** on antiandrogen monotherapy in premenopausal women with hirsutism:

- **First-line therapy**: COCs are suggested for most women who are not seeking fertility, as they suppress ovarian androgen production, increase SHBG, and regulate menstrual cycles [^115F4Jo5] [^113SpJFK].

- **Antiandrogen monotherapy**: The ES suggests against antiandrogen monotherapy as initial therapy unless adequate contraception is used, due to teratogenic risks [^115F4Jo5] [^1163J78f].

- **Flutamide**: The ES recommends against flutamide because of potential hepatotoxicity [^115F4Jo5] [^111rgwQd].

- **Combination therapy**: If hirsutism persists after 6 months of COC monotherapy, adding an antiandrogen is suggested, with no preference for a specific agent, but flutamide should be avoided [^115F4Jo5] [^112ru9JG].

---

## Risks associated with antiandrogen monotherapy

Antiandrogen monotherapy carries **significant risks**, particularly in women of reproductive age:

- **Teratogenicity**: Antiandrogens can cause feminization of male fetuses, making reliable contraception essential during therapy [^115F4Jo5] [^115FrRWw].

- **Hepatotoxicity**: Flutamide is associated with dose-dependent hepatotoxicity, necessitating regular liver function monitoring if used [^115F4Jo5] [^111rgwQd].

- **Menstrual irregularities**: Antiandrogens can cause menstrual irregularities, which may complicate management without hormonal regulation [^115F4Jo5].

---

## Alternative first-line therapy: combined oral contraceptives

COCs are the **preferred first-line therapy** for hirsutism in premenopausal women, including those who are not sexually active. COCs provide multiple benefits:

- **Androgen suppression**: COCs suppress ovarian androgen production and increase SHBG, reducing free androgen levels [^115F4Jo5] [^113SpJFK].

- **Menstrual regulation**: COCs regulate menstrual cycles, reducing the risk of endometrial hyperplasia [^115F4Jo5].

- **Contraception**: Although the patient is not sexually active, COCs provide contraception if her status changes, aligning with guideline recommendations [^115F4Jo5].

---

## Situations where antiandrogen monotherapy may be considered

In select scenarios, antiandrogen monotherapy may be considered, but **only with reliable contraception**:

- **Contraindications to COCs**: Patients with contraindications to estrogen-containing therapies may consider antiandrogen monotherapy with effective contraception [^115F4Jo5].

- **Patient preference**: If the patient strongly prefers antiandrogen monotherapy, she must use reliable contraception (e.g. LARC) and understand the risks [^115F4Jo5] [^111uHyNz].

- **Severe hirsutism**: In cases of severe hirsutism causing significant distress, combination therapy with COCs and antiandrogens may be initiated with careful monitoring [^116U9x3E].

---

## Recommended antiandrogen if monotherapy is chosen

If antiandrogen monotherapy is chosen despite recommendations, **spironolactone is the preferred agent** due to its efficacy and favorable safety profile compared with flutamide [^114Po2jr]. Typical dosing ranges from 50 to 200 mg daily, with monitoring for hyperkalemia and menstrual irregularities [^1164uEVK].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regardless of the chosen therapy, **regular monitoring is essential**:

- **Clinical response**: Assess hirsutism improvement every 3–6 months [^11448eMq].

- **Adverse effects**: Monitor for side effects, including menstrual irregularities, hyperkalemia (with spironolactone), and liver function (if flutamide is used) [^115F4Jo5].

- **Contraception**: Ensure reliable contraception is maintained if antiandrogens are used [^115F4Jo5].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

Antiandrogen monotherapy, including flutamide, is **not recommended** for this patient due to teratogenic risks and the lack of reliable contraception. COCs are the **preferred first-line therapy** [^115F4Jo5]. If antiandrogen therapy is considered, it should be added to COCs after 6 months if response is inadequate, or used with reliable contraception if monotherapy is strongly preferred, with spironolactone as the preferred antiandrogen [^112tApJQ] [^115F4Jo5] [^114Po2jr].

Context

The relative efficacy of antiandrogens for the treatment of hirsutism remains unclear.

Objective

We performed a systematic review and metaanalyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the effect of antiandrogens on hirsutism.

Data Sources

We used librarian-designed search strategies for MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane CENTRAL (up to May 2006), review of reference lists, and contact with hirsutism experts to identify eligible RCTs.

Study Selection

Eligible studies were RCTs of at least 6 months of antiandrogen use in women with hirsutism. Reviewers, with acceptable chance-adjusted agreement (kappa = 0.72), independently assessed eligibility.

Data Extraction

Reviewers used structured forms to assess and collect methodological quality (allocation concealment, blinding, and loss to follow-up) and study data.

Data Synthesis

Of 348 candidate studies, 12 were eligible (18 comparisons). Their methodological quality was low. Random-effects metaanalyses showed that compared with placebo, antiandrogens reduce Ferriman-Gallwey scores by 3.9 [95% confidence interval (CI), 2.3–5.4; inconsistency (I²) = 0%]. When compared with metformin, spironolactone reduced hirsutism scores by 1.3 (CI, 0.03–2.6) and flutamide by 5.0 (CI, 3.0–7.0; I² = 0%). For these interventions, two to five women need to receive treatment for one to notice improvement. Spironolactone or finasteride in combination with contraceptives (1.7; CI, 0.1–3.3; I² = 0%) or flutamide with metformin (4.6; CI, 1.3–7.9; I² = 40%) appear superior to monotherapy with contraceptives and metformin, respectively. Only three RCTs reported patient self-assessments of hirsutism.

Conclusions

Weak evidence suggests antiandrogens are mildly effective agents for the treatment of hirsutism.

### Hirsutism: an evidence-based treatment update [^114Po2jr]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Hirsutism has a relatively high prevalence among women. Depending upon societal and ethnic norms, it can cause significant psychosocial distress. Importantly, hirsutism may be associated with underlying disorders and co-morbidities. Hirsutism should not simply be looked upon as an issue of cosmesis. Patients require appropriate evaluation so that underlying etiologies and associated sequelae are recognized and managed. Treatment of hirsutism often requires a multidisciplinary approach, and a variety of physical or pharmacologic modalities can be employed. Efficacy of these therapies is varied and depends, among other things, upon patient factors including the underlying etiology, hormonal drive, and local tissue sensitivity to androgens.

Objective

The objective of this paper is to review and summarize current evidence evaluating the efficacy of various treatment modalities for hirsutism in premenopausal women.

Methods

Online databases were searched to identify all relevant prior systematic reviews and meta-analyses as well as recently published (2012-present) randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on hirsutism treatment.

Results

Four recently published RCTs met criteria for inclusion in our review. In addition, one meta-analysis and one systematic review/treatment guideline were identified in the recent literature. Physical modalities and oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) remain first-line treatments. Evidence supports the use of electrolysis for permanent hair removal in localized areas and lasers (particularly alexandrite and diode lasers) for permanent hair reduction. Topical eflornithine can be used as monotherapy for mild hirsutism and as an adjunct therapy with lasers or pharmacotherapy in more severe cases. Combined OCPs as a class are superior to placebo; however, antiandrogenic and low-dose neutral OCPs may be slightly more efficacious in improving hirsutism compared with other types of OCPs. Antiandrogens are indicated for moderate to severe hirsutism, with spironolactone being the first-line antiandrogen and finasteride and cyproterone acetate being second-line antiandrogens. Due to its risk for hepatotoxicity, flutamide is not considered a first-line therapy. If used, the lowest effective dose should be administered with careful monitoring of liver enzymes. Monotherapy with an insulin sensitizer does not significantly improve hirsutism. While insulin sensitizers improve important metabolic and endocrine aberrations in polycystic ovary syndrome, they are not recommended when hirsutism is the sole indication for use. Lifestyle modification counseling is recommended. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogs and glucocorticoids are only recommended in specific circumstances. Additional therapies without sufficient supportive evidence of efficacy are ovarian surgery, statins (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors), and vitamin D supplementation.

Limitations

In general, most therapies garner recommendations that are weak (where the estimates of benefits versus risks of therapy are either closely balanced or uncertain) and are based on low- to moderate-quality evidence.

Conclusions

Risks and benefits of treatment must be carefully considered and discussed with the patient. Expectations for efficacy should be appropriately set. A minimum of 6 months is required to see benefit from pharmacotherapy and lifelong treatment is often necessary for sustained benefit.

### Evaluation and treatment of hirsutism in premenopausal women: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^1152vRm2]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

Our objective was to develop clinical practice guidelines for the evaluation and treatment of hirsutism in premenopausal women.

Participants

The Task Force was composed of a chair, selected by the Clinical Guidelines Subcommittee (CGS) of The Endocrine Society, six additional experts, two methodologists, and a medical writer. The Task Force received no corporate funding or remuneration.

Evidence

Systematic reviews of available evidence were used to formulate the key treatment and prevention recommendations. We used the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) group criteria to describe both the quality of evidence and the strength of recommendations. We used "recommend" for strong recommendations, and "suggest" for weak recommendations.

Consensus Process

Consensus was guided by systematic reviews of evidence and discussions during one group meeting, several conference calls, and e-mail communications. The drafts prepared by the Task Force with the help of a medical writer were reviewed successively by The Endocrine Society's CGS, Clinical Affairs Core Committee (CACC), and Council. The version approved by the CGS and CACC was placed on The Endocrine Society's Web site for comments by members. At each stage of review, the Task Force received written comments and incorporated needed changes.

Conclusions

We suggest testing for elevated androgen levels in women with moderate or severe hirsutism or hirsutism of any degree when it is sudden in onset, rapidly progressive, or associated with other abnormalities such as menstrual dysfunction, obesity, or clitoromegaly. For women with patient-important hirsutism despite cosmetic measures, we suggest either pharmacological therapy or direct hair removal methods. For pharmacological therapy, we suggest oral contraceptives for the majority of women, adding an antiandrogen after 6 months if the response is suboptimal. We recommend against antiandrogen monotherapy unless adequate contraception is used. We suggest against using insulin-lowering drugs. For women who choose hair removal therapy, we suggest laser/photoepilation.

### Efficacy and safety of anti-androgens in the management of polycystic ovary syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^112dxxiT]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Summary

Background

Anti-androgens and combined oral contraceptive pills (COCPs) may mitigate hyperandrogenism-related symptoms of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). However, their efficacy and safety in PCOS remain unclear as previous reviews have focused on non-PCOS populations. To inform the 2023 International Evidence-based Guideline in PCOS, we conducted the first systematic review and meta-analysis investigating the efficacy and safety of anti-androgens in the management of hormonal and clinical features of PCOS.

Methods

We systematically searched MEDLINE, Embase, PsycInfo, All EBM reviews, and CINAHL up to 28th June 2023 for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) examining oral anti-androgen use, alone or in combination with metformin, COCPs, lifestyle, or other interventions, in women of any age, with PCOS diagnosed by Rotterdam, National Institutes of Health or Androgen Excess & PCOS Society criteria, and using a form of contraception. Non-English studies and studies of less than 6 months duration or which used the same anti-androgen regimen in both/all groups were excluded in order to establish efficacy for the clinical outcomes of interest. Three authors screened articles against selection criteria and assessed risk of bias and quality using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) framework. Critical outcomes (prioritised during guideline development for GRADE purposes) included weight, body mass index (BMI), irregular cycles, hirsutism, liver function, and quality of life. Random effects meta-analyses were conducted where appropriate. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42022345640.

Findings

From 1660 studies identified in the search, 27 articles comprising 20 unique studies were included. Of these, 13 studies (n = 961) were pooled in meta-analysis. Seven studies had a high risk of bias, nine moderate and four low. Anti-androgens included finasteride, flutamide, spironolactone, or bicalutamide. In meta-analysis, anti-androgens + lifestyle were superior to metformin + lifestyle for hirsutism (weighted mean difference [WMD] [95% CI]: −1.59 [−3.06, −0.12], p = 0.03; I² = 74%), SHBG (7.70 nmol/l [0.75, 14.66], p = 0.03; I² = 0%), fasting insulin and fasting insulin: glucose ratio (−2.11 μU/ml [−3.97, −0.26], p = 0.03; I² = 0% and −1.12 [−1.44, −0.79], p < 0.0001, I² = 0%, respectively), but were not superior to placebo + lifestyle for hirsutism (−0.93, [−3.37, 1.51], p = 0.45; I² = 76%) or SHBG (9.72 nmol/l [−0.71, 20.14], p = 0.07; I² = 31%). Daily use was more effective for hirsutism than use every three days (−3.48 [−4.58, −2.39], p < 0.0001, I² = 1%), and resulted in lower androstenedione levels (−0.30 ng/ml [−0.50, −0.10], p = 0.004; I² = 0%). Combination treatment with anti-androgens + metformin + lifestyle resulted in lower testosterone compared with metformin + lifestyle (−0.29 nmol/l [−0.52, −0.06], p = 0.01; I² = 61%), but there were no differences in hirsutism when anti-androgens + metformin + lifestyle were compared with either anti-androgens + lifestyle or metformin + lifestyle. In limited meta-analyses (n = 2 trials), combining anti-androgens with COCP resulted in poorer lipid profiles compared with COCP ± placebo, with no differences in other outcomes.

Interpretation

Current evidence does not support the use of anti-androgens preferentially to COCPs to treat hyperandrogenism in PCOS. Anti-androgens could be considered to treat hirsutism in PCOS, where COCPs are contraindicated, poorly tolerated, or present a sub-optimal response after a minimum 6-month period, with consideration of clinical context and individual risk factors and characteristics.

### Medical treatment of hirsutism [^111jbCy1]. Dermatologic Therapy (2008). Low credibility.

Hirsutism is usually the result of an underlying adrenal, ovarian, or central endocrine abnormality mainly due to polycystic ovary syndrome but may also be idiopathic or drug induced. The aim of medical treatment of hirsutism is to rectify any causal hormonal balance, slow down or stop excessive hair growth, and improve the aesthetic appearance of hirsutism, thereby positively affecting the patient's quality of life. Today, for the majority of women, a monotherapy with oral contraceptives that have antiandrogenic activity is recommended as a first-line treatment for hirsutism. Combining an oral contraceptive pill with an antiandrogen is recommended if clinical improvement of hirsutism is insufficient after 6–9 months' monotherapy. In women who present with hirsutism, hyperandrogenism, and insulin resistance, insulin sensitizers are effective for the hirsutism as well as the hyperinsulinemia, hyperandrogenism, and infertility but there is no convincing evidence that they are effective for hirsutism alone. Topical eflornithine is a medical therapy that can be a useful adjuvant for hirsutism when used in conjunction with systemic medications or with laser/photoepilation.

### Treatment options for hirsutism: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^114dyYuz]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Several pharmacologic treatments for hirsutism are used in practice; however, their relative efficacy is unclear.

Methods

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CENTRAL through January 2017 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with follow-up of at least 6 months that evaluated antiandrogens, insulin sensitizers, and oral contraceptives in women with hirsutism. Independent pairs of reviewers selected and appraised trials. Random-effects network meta-analysis was used to compare individual drugs and classes.

Results

We included 43 trials. Estrogen-progestin oral contraceptives pills (OCPs), antiandrogens, and insulin sensitizers were superior to placebo, with standardized mean reductions (95% confidence intervals) of -0.94 (-1.49 to -0.38), -1.29 (-1.80 to -0.79), and -0.62 (-1.00 to -0.23), respectively. Antiandrogen monotherapy, the combination of OCP and antiandrogen, the combination of OCPs and insulin sensitizer, and the combination of antiandrogen and insulin sensitizer were superior to insulin sensitizer monotherapy. The combination of OCPs and antiandrogen was superior to OCPs. Antiandrogen monotherapy with flutamide, finasteride, and spironolactone were each superior to placebo but similar to each other in efficacy. OCPs containing levonorgestrel, cyproterone acetate, or drospirenone were similar in effectiveness to other OCPs or had trivial differences. The certainty in comparisons with placebo was moderate and for head-to-head comparisons was low.

Conclusions

Estrogen-progestin OCPs, antiandrogens, and insulin sensitizers are superior to placebo for the treatment of hirsutism.

### Evaluation and treatment of hirsutism in premenopausal women: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^114tKYEm]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To update the "Evaluation and Treatment of Hirsutism in Premenopausal Women: An Endocrine Society Clinical Practice Guideline", published by the Endocrine Society in 2008.

Participants

The participants include an Endocrine Society-appointed task force of seven medical experts and a methodologist.

Evidence

This evidence-based guideline was developed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation system to describe the strength of recommendations and the quality of evidence. The task force commissioned two systematic reviews and used the best available evidence from other published systematic reviews and individual studies.

Consensus Process

Group meetings, conference calls, and e-mail communications facilitated consensus development. Endocrine Society committees, members, and cosponsoring organizations reviewed and commented on preliminary drafts of the guidelines.

Conclusion

We suggest testing for elevated androgen levels in all women with an abnormal hirsutism score. We suggest against testing for elevated androgen levels in eumenorrheic women with unwanted local hair growth (i.e., in the absence of an abnormal hirsutism score). For most women with patient-important hirsutism despite cosmetic measures (shaving, plucking, waxing), we suggest starting with pharmacological therapy and adding direct hair removal methods (electrolysis, photoepilation) for those who desire additional cosmetic benefit. For women with mild hirsutism and no evidence of an endocrine disorder, we suggest either pharmacological therapy or direct hair removal methods. For pharmacological therapy, we suggest oral combined estrogen-progestin contraceptives for the majority of women, adding an antiandrogen after 6 months if the response is suboptimal. We recommend against antiandrogen monotherapy unless adequate contraception is used. We suggest against using insulin-lowering drugs. For most women who choose hair removal therapy, we suggest laser/photoepilation.

### The hirsute woman: challenges in evaluation and management [^117Ah3uj]. Endocrine Practice (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the etiology, pathogenesis, diagnostic approach, and management of hirsutism.

Methods

We discuss the clinical course of hirsutism and provide our recommendations on the various treatment options available.

Results

Hirsutism is a common clinical problem characterized by the presence of increased terminal hair growth in androgen-dependent areas of the skin. The development of hirsutism depends on the presence of the pilosebaceous unit, which is genetically determined, as well as the presence of the androgen receptor and intracellular 5α-reductase activity, which converts testosterone to its more active metabolite, dihydrotestosterone. A detailed history and physical examination and the following laboratory tests can diagnose most causes of hirsutism: early-morning follicular phase measurement of total testosterone, testosterone not bound to sex hormone-binding globulin, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, 17-hydroxyprogesterone, prolactin, and thyrotropin levels. Oral contraceptive preparations may be effective monotherapy for mild hirsutism. For the treatment of more severe hirsutism, oral contraceptive pills combined with spironolactone are as effective as oral contraceptive pills containing cyproterone acetate, which are not available in the United States. Because of teratogenicity, spironolactone should be used with caution in premenopausal women when it is administered without an oral contraceptive pill. Metformin is an alternative therapy for hirsutism in women with polycystic ovary syndrome who have other indications for metformin use. Metformin is not as effective as antiandrogens for the management of hirsutism. The use of glucocorticoids, finasteride, or flutamide is not recommended.

Conclusions

Hirsutism can be evaluated with a detailed history and physical examination and a limited number of hormonal tests. Serious disorders presenting as hirsutism are rare and can be excluded with the recommended evaluation. Treatment is targeted at reducing the production and bioavailability of testosterone, as well as blocking target tissue androgen action.

### Use of antiandrogens as therapy for women with polycystic ovary syndrome [^115EjuSB]. Fertility and Sterility (2006). Low credibility.

Because androgen excess plays a fundamental role in symptoms and, it is likely, in pathogenesis of polycystic ovary syndrome, attenuation of hyperandrogenism appears to be of paramount importance in the therapy of this condition. Consistently, drugs inhibiting androgen receptor binding not only are an effective tool in hirsutism treatment but also show favorable effects on body composition and metabolic features of these women.

### Evaluation and treatment of hirsutism in premenopausal women: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^117A2TLZ]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). Medium credibility.

Women with NCCAH — Our approach to treating hirsutism in women with NCCAH is the same as for women with PCOS. We suggest starting with an OC and adding an antiandrogen after 6 months if necessary; clinicians can administer an antiandrogen as initial therapy if the woman is not pursuing pregnancy and has a reliable form of contraception. We only suggest glucocorticoids for hirsutism when response to OCs and/or antiandrogens is suboptimal or they are not tolerated. For hirsutism, we use prednisone 4 to 6 mg daily or dexamethasone 0.25 mg/d, and clinicians should counsel about the teratogenic risks of antiandrogens. For ovulation induction, we suggest glucocorticoid therapy; we typically start with prednisone 5 mg daily, and if ovulation has not occurred, the dose can be increased to 7.5 mg.

### Efficacy and safety of anti-androgens in the management of polycystic ovary syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^112ihpNK]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

While other anti-androgen pharmacological agents, such as spironolactone, may be considered for treating clinical hirsutism, first-line therapy remains the COCP. This is because the COCP can improve menstrual cyclicity while providing effective contraception, whereas anti-androgens are teratogenic since they can interfere with external genital development of male fetuses. Consistent with our findings, a systematic review and network meta-analysis by Barrionuevo et al.of 43 studies reported that anti-androgens in combination with the COCP may have additive benefits for hirsutism, noting important methodological limitations in the available evidence. However, Barrionuevo et al.investigated women with idiopathic hirsutism and specifically excluded women with PCOS. An earlier systematic review of 28 studies by Koulouri et al.identified improvements in hirsutism following anti-androgen treatment, which were associated with BMI; however, this review included broader hirsute populations, rather than PCOS specifically, and is likely outdated given that the search was conducted 17 years ago (in 2006). Although PCOS constitutes 65–75% of hirsutism cases, other causes of hirsutism such as Cushing's syndrome, androgen-producing tumours, hyperprolactinaemia, and peripheral androgen activity, may necessitate different and more nuanced treatment approaches than those needed in PCOS, particularly due to the cardiometabolic implications of the latter. Here, we extend the potential benefits of anti-androgens on hirsutism to women with PCOS, while maintaining that COCP remains first-line therapy pending further study.

Combined oral estrogen–progestin contraceptives (OCs) — scope, antiandrogenic potency, and mechanisms: The guideline notes that "oral progestin-only contraceptives" are "ineffective for hirsutism" and that progestins "exhibit varying degrees of androgenicity". Reported potency equivalences are: "3 mg DSP (the dose used in OCs) was equivalent to only 9 to 10 mg spironolactone", while "100 to 200 mg spironolactone is the therapeutic dose for hirsutism", and "2 mg CPA (the dose used in OCs) was equivalent to ~50 mg spironolactone". A "12-month trial" of OCs with "either 3 mg DSP or 2 mg CPA showed similar reductions in hirsutism scores". Mechanistically, OC therapy reduces hyperandrogenism via "suppression of luteinizing hormone secretion", "stimulation of hepatic production of sex hormone–binding globulin (SHBG)… reducing serum free androgen concentrations", "a slight reduction in both adrenal androgen secretion and binding of androgens to their receptor", with "a reduction of testosterone production", and "Androgenic progestins also increase the metabolic clearance of testosterone". There "may also be a small direct effect in inhibiting 5α-reductase activity in the pilosebaceous unit".

### Management of hirsutism [^115qdhxq]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2001). Low credibility.

This review reports our own experience with, and literature studies of, the pharmacological management of hirsutism in women with hyperandrogenism (polycystic ovary syndrome) or with normal serum androgen levels and regular ovulatory menstrual cycles (idiopathic hirsutism). Treatment consists of suppressing ovarian or adrenal androgen secretion, or blocking androgen actions in the skin. The major drugs used are gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists, combined oral contraceptives (COCs), and steroidal (cyproterone acetate and spironolactone) or nonsteroidal (flutamide and finasteride) antiandrogens. GnRH agonists, suppressing the pituitary, decrease androgen and estradiol secretion and improve severe hirsutism. To avoid estrogen deficiency problems, 'add back' therapy with estrogen-progestogen or COCs is advisable. This method of treatment is complicated and expensive, limiting its use to severe forms of ovarian hyperandrogenism with hyperinsulinemia. The third-generation COCs, containing new progestogens or cyproterone, have very restricted effectiveness in the short term (6 cycles), but their long term use (> 12 cycles) cures mild-to-moderate hirsutism and improves severe hirsutism. As well as suppressing gonadotropins and ovarian androgen steroidogenesis, these formulations decrease free testosterone levels and may also decrease adrenal androgen production. In women being treated with antiandrogens, COCs are important to provide control of the menstrual cycle and contraception. Cyproterone, a progestational agent, inhibits gonadotropin secretion and blocks androgen action. It is used in COCs or in a reverse sequential regimen. In the latter, it is very effective in the short term treatment of hirsutism. Spironolactone blocks androgen receptors. Its effectiveness in hirsutism is dosage-dependent: low dosages are less active than other antiandrogens, whereas high dosages (200 mg/day) are very effective at the cost of several adverse effects (particularly dysfunctional uterine bleeding), but the concomitant use of a COC may prevent these. Flutamide is a pure antiandrogen that blocks androgen receptors and inhibits hair growth. It is very effective in treating hirsutism within 6 to 12 months. Dry skin is very frequent during treatment with flutamide, and hepatotoxicity is possible at high dosages. Finasteride, a 5 alpha-reductase type 2 inhibitor, is the least effective antiandrogen, but a dosage of 5 mg/day decreases hirsutism without adverse effects. Pregnancy must be avoided during therapy with antiandrogens because of the possible risk of abnormal development of a male fetus. Antiandrogens, especially flutamide (250 to 500 mg/day) and cyproterone (12.5 to 50 mg/day in a reverse sequential regimen), alone or in association with COCs, seem to be the most effective agents for the treatment of hirsutism.

### Screening and management of the hyperandrogenic adolescent: ACOG committee opinion, number 789 [^11448eMq]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). High credibility.

Hyperandrogenism follow-up in adolescents — Before initiation of any medical therapy, expectations of treatment should be discussed with the patient; for those using isotretinoin, these patients should be counseled to use dual methods of contraception (eg, condoms and an OCP) because of the significant risk of teratogenicity. During management, patients should be assessed at routine intervals (every 3–6 months) for adverse effects and response to treatment until their condition is stable; they then should be monitored annually. With combination therapy, often antiandrogens can be discontinued or tapered over time, with continuation of oral contraception as monotherapy. Monitoring serum androgens is not recommended. Although data are unclear, consider monitoring potassium levels if patients taking spironolactone have medical comorbidities that affect renal function, and management should be individualized based on spironolactone dose and other comorbidities. Adolescents with hirsutism or acne can be treated with a goal of symptom control before assignment of a final diagnosis, and anticipatory guidance is critical to help patients understand the timeline for expected responses to therapy.

Endocrine Society hirsutism — pretest probability and neoplasm red flags: The decision to test for androgen excess depends both on the pretest likelihood that an abnormal value may be found and upon whether a detected abnormality will determine the approach to treatment. Most women with local hair growth and regular menses who have no evidence to suggest an endocrine cause have a very low likelihood of excess androgen production, whereas patients with hirsutism or with clinical features suggesting an underlying endocrine disorder are more likely to have excess androgen production. A rapid pace of development or progression of hirsutism, progression in spite of therapy, or evidence of virilization points to a greater likelihood of an androgen-secreting neoplasm, although some tumors producing only moderately excessive androgen have indolent presentations.

### Cyproterone acetate for hirsutism [^111ZPWsn]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Hirsutism is a distressing and relatively common endocrine problem in women which may prove difficult to manage. Cyproterone acetate, an anti-androgen, is frequently used to treat hirsutism, usually in combination with ethinyl estradiol.

Objectives

The objective of this review was to investigate the effectiveness of cyproterone acetate alone, or in combination with ethinyl estradiol, in reducing hair growth in women with hirsutism secondary to ovarian hyperandrogenism.

Search Strategy

The Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group trials register was searched (last search - 4 June 2002). The Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group register is based on regular searches of MEDLINE (1966 to 2002), EMBASE (1980 to 2002), CINAHL (1982 to 2002), PsycINFO (1987 to 2002) and CENTRAL (Issue 2, 2002 of the Cochrane Library) the handsearching of several journals and conference proceedings, and searches of several key grey literature sources. All publications of randomised controlled trials of cyproterone acetate with or without estrogen versus placebo or other drug therapies for hirsutism were identified.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled studies comparing:- cyproterone acetate to placebo- cyproterone acetate with ethinyl estradiol to placebo- cyproterone acetate with ethinyl estradiol to cyproterone acetate alone- cyproterone acetate (with or without estradiol) to other medical therapies for treatment of hirsutism.

Data Collection and Analysis

Eleven studies were identified which fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Nine randomised studies were included in the review, and two were excluded because of insufficient information. Only one study had more than 100 women included in the analysis. The major outcomes included: subjective improvement in hirsutism, changes in Ferriman Gallwey scores, changes in linear hair growth and hair shaft diameter, alterations in endocrine parameters, side effects to treatment, withdrawals during therapy

Main Results

There were no clinical trials comparing cyproterone acetate alone with placebo. There was one small study comparing cyproterone acetate in combination with ethinyl estradiol to placebo. In this study there was a significant subjective reduction in hair growth with cyproterone acetate therapy, although the confidence limits were large. There were no studies comparing cyproterone acetate alone with cyproterone acetate in combination with ethinyl estradiol to treat hirsutism. In studies where cyproterone acetate was compared to other drug modalities (ketoconazole, spironolactone, flutamide, finasteride, GnRH analogues) no difference in clinical outcome was noted. There were, however, endocrinological differences in androgen and estrogen levels between different drug therapies. There were insufficient data to assess differences in side effects between women treated with cyproterone acetate and other medical therapy.

Reviewer's Conclusions

Cyproterone acetate combined with estradiol results in a subjective improvement in hirsutism compared to placebo. Clinical differences in outcome between cyproterone acetate and other medical therapies were not demonstrated in the studies included in this review. This may be because of the small size of the studies, lack of standardized assessment and lack of objective determinants of improvement in hirsutism. The endocrinological effects of the different drug therapies reflect the mode of action. Larger carefully designed studies are needed to compare efficacy and safety profiles between drug therapies for hirsutism.

Glucocorticoid therapy for hyperandrogenism — Clinicians administer glucocorticoids long-term to suppress adrenal androgens in women with classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency; in these patients, glucocorticoids help prevent or manage hirsutism and are effective for maintaining normal ovulatory cycles. In the nonclassic form of 21-hydroxylase deficiency they are effective for ovulation induction, but their role in managing hirsutism is less clear. In pure adrenal hyperandrogenism, suppressing adrenal androgens results in only minor improvements in hirsutism, although prolonged remission after therapy withdrawal can occur.

Limitations in the review process should also be noted. Due to being poorly reported or presented in a format which was not amenable to meta-analysis, some data were excluded, leading to missing or incomplete information for some comparisons. Although exclusion of these data was necessary to ensure consistency and rigor in the review process, this meant that sample sizes were small for many comparisons and it is possible that their inclusion may have impacted on our results, urging caution in the interpretation of these findings. We addressed this limitation to some extent via sensitivity analysis by RoB; however, this was not possible for all comparisons or outcomes due to the small number of included studies. Moreover, studies in languages other than English were excluded due to resource and time constraints, and some full texts were not found; hence, potentially relevant results may have been excluded from the review. Lastly, publication bias cannot be ruled out given that this could not be adequately judged by inspection of funnel plots (since less than 10 studies were assessed in each analysis) and grey literature (unpublished work) was not sourced or included in the review.

In summary, anti-androgens may have possible benefits on clinical hyperandrogenism (i.e. hirsutism) in combination with effective contraception but, per guideline recommendations, should be used in circumstances where COCP (and/or cosmetic options including mechanical laser and light therapies for hair reduction) are contraindicated, poorly tolerated, or have been ineffective for a minimum period of 6 months. This general recommendation is based on the best available evidence, which remains limited due to high heterogeneity; hence, application should incorporate clinical judgement, contextual factors and individual characteristics and preferences. While the optimal types and doses of anti-androgens in PCOS cannot be determined from the available evidence, general population data suggests that 25–100 mg daily of spironolactone appears to be safe. Based on the available evidence, COCPs remain the recommended first-line therapy for clinical hyperandrogenism in PCOS, until further high-quality, adequately powered studies can demonstrate further benefits for anti-androgens in the context of PCOS.

Values and preferences for testing for hyperandrogenemia: The suggestion for testing for hyperandrogenemia in all women with hirsutism places a relatively high value on identifying treatable underlying hyperandrogenic diseases, whereas the suggestion for not testing in patients with normal variant unwanted hair for whom hormonal treatment is not contemplated places a relatively high value on avoiding false positives and resulting increases in medical tests and procedures; it places a relatively low value on early detection of mild hyperandrogenemia that will not affect initial management and outcome.

Appendix 2

Summary of treatment options in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)

Oligomenorrhoea/amenorrhoea

- Lifestyle change (5% to 10% weight loss and structured exercise).

- Oral contraceptive pill (OCP; low oestrogen doses, for example 20 μg may be preferable).

- Cyclic progestins (for example, 10 mg medroxyprogesterone acetate for 14 days every 2 to 3 months).

- Metformin (improves ovulation and menstrual cyclicity).

Hirsutism treatment recommendations

- Cosmetic therapy.

- Laser treatment.

- Eflornithine cream can be added and may induce a more rapid response.

Pharmacological therapy

- Medical therapy if patient concerned about hirsutism and cosmetic therapy ineffective, inaccessible or unaffordable.

- Primary therapy is the OCP (monitor glucose tolerance in those at risk of diabetes).

- Antiandrogen monotherapy should not be used without adequate contraception.

- Trial therapies for ≥ 6 months before changing dose or medication.

- **Combination therapy**: if ≥ 6 months of OCP is ineffective, add antiandrogen to OCP (daily spironolactone 50 mg twice a day or cyproterone acetate 25 mg/day for days 1 to 10 of the active OCP tablets).

Infertility

- Obesity independently exacerbates infertility and reduces effectiveness of interventions. Maternal and foetal pregnancy risks are greater and long-term metabolic outcomes in the child are related to maternal weight at conception. Consistent with international guidelines, women who are overweight prior to conception should be advised on folate, smoking cessation, weight loss and optimal exercise, prior to additional interventions.

- Given age-related infertility, advise women to optimise family planning.

- Infertility therapies may include clomiphene, gonadotrophins and in vitro fertilisation.

Metabolic syndrome, prediabetes, diabetes and cardiovascular disease risk

Obesity independently causes metabolic complications; lifestyle/exercise is critical:

- Lifestyle change with a 5% weight loss reduces diabetes risk by approximately 50% to 60% in high-risk groups.

- Metformin* reduces the risk of diabetes by approximately 50% in high-risk groups.

*Metformin and the OCP are not currently approved for use to manage PCOS by many regulatory bodies. The OCP is primarily indicated for contraception and metformin for diabetes. However, their use is recommended by international and national specialist societies and is evidence based.

Diagnosis of hirsutism — We suggest testing for elevated androgen levels in all women with an abnormal hirsutism score (2 ⊕⊕OO). In those cases where serum total testosterone levels are normal, if sexual hair growth is moderate/severe or sexual hair growth is mild but there is clinical evidence of a hyperandrogenic endocrine disorder (such as menstrual disturbance or progression in spite of therapy), we suggest measuring an early morning serum total and free testosterone by a reliable specialty assay (2 ⊕⊕OO).

Therapy with oral contraceptives — androgen suppression and sexual function: Ovarian androgen production is suppressed by hormonal contraception, and oral contraceptives are a mainstay for therapy of hyperandrogenic amenorrhea that suppress T and androstenedione and reduce hirsutism; limited evidence suggests oral contraceptives may also reduce circulating DHEAS, raising adrenal suppression concerns, but there is no evidence this is clinically significant; increases in plasma sex hormone–binding globulin (SHBG) caused by oral contraceptives are exaggerated in women with sexual dysfunction, limited evidence links androgen suppression while taking oral contraceptives to reduced sexual interest and response, a randomized controlled study did not show different sexual function effects among androgenic versus antiandrogenic progestins, and there is no evidence to support concomitant therapy with T, making the androgen-deficiency model of ovarian suppression by oral contraceptives not compelling.

Pathogenesis of hirsutism — androgen dependence and hair growth cycle: The growth of sexual hair is entirely dependent on the presence of androgen, and androgens appear to induce vellus follicles in sex-specific areas to develop into terminal hairs, which are larger and more heavily pigmented. Hairs grow in nonsynchronous cycles, and the growth (anagen) phase is ~4 months for facial hair, and due to the long hair growth cycle it takes ~6 months to detect the effects of hormonal therapy.

### Metformin versus the combined oral contraceptive pill for hirsutism, acne, and menstrual pattern in polycystic ovary syndrome [^115UZTXP]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Metformin has been proposed as possibly a safer and more effective long-term treatment than the oral contraceptive pill (OCP) in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). It is important to directly compare the efficacy and safety of metformin versus OCP in the long-term treatment of women with PCOS. This is an update of a Cochrane Review comparing insulin sensitising agents with the OCP and only includes studies on metformin.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and safety of metformin versus the OCP (alone or in combination) in improving clinical, hormonal, and metabolic features of PCOS.

Search Methods

In August 2019 we searched the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group Trials Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase and CINAHL, the trial registers, handsearched references of the identified articles, and contacted experts in the field to identify additional studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of the use of metformin versus the OCP (alone or in combination) for women with PCOS.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methods recommended by Cochrane. The primary review outcomes were the clinical parameters of hirsutism and adverse events, both severe (requiring stopping of medication), and minor. In the presence of substantial heterogeneity (I 2 statistic > 50), which could be explained by pre-specified subgroup analyses on the basis of BMI, we reported the subgroups separately.

Main Results

This is a substantive update. We identified 38 additional studies. We included 44 RCTs (2253 women), which comprised 39 RCTs on adult women (2047 women) and five RCTs on adolescent women (206 women). Evidence quality ranged from very low to low. The main limitations were risk of bias, imprecision and inconsistency. Metformin versus the OCP In adult women, we are uncertain of the effect of metformin compared to the OCP on hirsutism in subgroup body mass index (BMI) < 25 kg/m 2 (mean difference (MD) 0.38, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.44 to 1.19, 3 RCTs, n = 134, I² = 50%, very low-quality evidence) and subgroup BMI > 30 kg/m 2 (MD -0.38, 95% CI -1.93 to 1.17; 2 RCTs, n = 85, I² = 34%, low-quality evidence). Metformin may be less effective in improving hirsutism compared to the OCP in the subgroup BMI 25 kg/m 2 to 30 kg/m 2 (MD 1.92, 95% CI 1.21 to 2.64, 5 RCTs, n = 254, I² = 0%, low-quality evidence). Metformin may increase severe gastro-intestinal adverse events rate compared to the OCP (Peto odds ratio (OR) 6.42, 95% CI 2.98 to 13.84, 11 RCTs, n = 602, I² = 0%, low-quality evidence). Metformin may decrease the incidence of severe other adverse events compared to the OCP (Peto OR 0.20, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.44, 8 RCTs, n = 363, I² = 0%, low-quality evidence). There were no trials reporting on minor adverse events. In adolescents, we are uncertain whether there is a difference between Metformin and the OCP, on hirsutism and adverse events. Metformin versus metformin combined with the OCP In adult women, metformin may be less effective in improving hirsutism compared to Metformin combined with the OCP (MD 1.36, 95% CI 0.62 to 2.11, 3 RCTs, n = 135, I² = 9%, low-quality evidence). We are uncertain if there was a difference between metformin and metformin combined with the OCP for severe gastro-intestinal adverse events (OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.21 to 2.53, 3 RCTs, n = 171, I² = 0%, low-quality evidence), or for severe other adverse events (OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.11 to 2.82, 2 RCTs, n = 109, I² = 44%, low-quality evidence). There were no trials reporting on minor adverse events. In adolescents, there were no trials for this comparison. The OCP versus metformin combined with the OCP In adult women, the OCP may be less effective in improving hirsutism compared to metformin combined with the OCP (MD 0.54, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.89, 6 RCTs, n = 389, I² = 1%, low-quality evidence). The OCP may decrease the incidence of severe gastro-intestinal adverse events compared to metformin combined with the OCP (OR 0.20, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.72, 5 RCTs, n = 228, I² = 0%, low-quality evidence). We are uncertain if there is a difference between the OCP and metformin combined with the OCP for severe other adverse events (OR 1.61, 95% CI 0.49 to 5.37, 4 RCTs, n = 159, I² = 12%, low-quality evidence). The OCP may decrease the incidence of minor (gastro-intestinal) adverse events compared to metformin combined with the OCP (OR 0.06, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.44, 2 RCTs, n = 98, I² = 0%, low-quality evidence). In adolescents, we are uncertain whether there is a difference between the OCP, compared to metformin combined with the OCP, on hirsutism or adverse events.

Authors' Conclusions

In adult women with PCOS, metformin may be less effective in improving hirsutism compared to the OCP in the subgroup BMI 25 kg/m 2 to 30 kg/m 2 but we are uncertain if there was a difference between metformin and the OCP in subgroups BMI < 25 kg/m 2 and BMI > 30kg/m 2. Compared to the OCP, metformin may increase the incidence of severe gastro-intestinal adverse events and decrease the incidence of severe other adverse events with no trials reporting on minor adverse events. Either metformin alone or the OCP alone may be less effective in improving hirsutism compared to metformin combined with the OCP. We are uncertain whether there is a difference between the OCP alone and metformin alone compared to metformin combined with the OCP for severe or minor adverse events except for the OCP versus metformin combined with the OCP where the OCP may decrease the incidence of severe and minor gastro-intestinal adverse events. In adolescent women with PCOS, we are uncertain whether there is a difference between any of the comparisons for hirsutism and adverse events due to either no evidence or very low-quality evidence. Further large well-designed RCTs that stratify for BMI are needed to evaluate metformin versus the OCP and combinations in women with PCOS, in particular adolescent women.

Recommendations suggest the use of the COCP alone with cosmetic therapy for at least 6 months prior to considering antiandrogens. Where COCPs are contraindicated or poorly tolerated, and in the presence of effective forms of contraception, antiandrogens could be considered to treat hirsutism or androgen-related alopecia. The use of effective contraception is essential due to the teratogenic potential of antiandrogens and their impairment of external genital development in male foetuses. This conditional evidence-based recommendation of very low GRADE quality was based mainly on studies in adult women and included the use of flutamide, finasteride or spironolactone alone or in combination with a diet intervention. The reported side effects were gastrointestinal, including mild elevation of transaminases. There was only one study including a small number of adolescents with PCOS (n = 14) that evaluated finasteride, but it lacked a direct comparison between groups and did not report side effects. There was insufficient evidence to make an evidence-based recommendation in relation to efficacy of specific types of antiandrogens; the trials included small numbers of subjects and some were not RCTs (see Section 4.6 in the Technical Report). This recommendation was also informed by the Endocrine Society guidelines for the management of hirsutism, which recommend the use of cosmetic and COCP therapy as the first-line treatment for hirsutism in women with PCOS.

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 194 summary: polycystic ovary syndrome [^112LFVHi]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Medium credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) — medical therapy for hirsutism highlights that no combined hormonal contraceptive has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and that antiandrogens are used empirically with important cautions. No combined hormonal contraceptive has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of hirsutism; observational or nonrandomized studies note improvement but no studies of adequate power confirm benefit, few comparative studies exist, and no one type has been shown superior; oral contraceptives may have additive benefit when combined with other modalities, most commonly spironolactone, and if a pill contains drospirenone it may be necessary to reduce the dose of spironolactone and evaluate potassium levels. None of the antiandrogen agents were developed to treat hyperandrogenism in women or are FDA-approved; a meta-analysis could only include 12 out of 348 eligible trials and found these agents are mildly effective; as a class they are teratogenic with a risk of feminization of the external genitalia in a male fetus, so they are frequently used with oral contraceptives. Spironolactone usual dosage is 25–100 mg, twice a day; a full clinical effect may take 6 months or more; approximately 20% of women will experience increased menstrual frequency; it should be used cautiously in women with renal impairment; and rarely exposure has resulted in ambiguous genitalia in male infants. Flutamide common dosage is 125–250 mg/d; the risk of teratogenicity is significant and contraception should be used; it has been combined with lifestyle and metformin therapy for PCOS and may have additive effects. Finasteride inhibits both forms of 5-α-reductase and is available as a 5-mg tablet for prostate cancer and a 1-mg tablet for male alopecia.

### Oral prolonged-release dienogest 2 mg and ethinylestradiol 0.02 mg in a 24 / 4-day regimen for polycystic ovary syndrome-associated hirsutism: a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial [^112c5NDV]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Although current international guidelines recommend COCs to regulate menses and control clinical hyperandrogenism in women with PCOS, none are approved specifically for managing PCOS-associated hirsutism. The ideal contraceptive for women with PCOS should: (1) limit antral follicle development by inhibiting the secretion of gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) and reducing LH levels resulting in less androgen production from the ovaries; (2) counteract the effect of androgens on the pilosebaceous unit; (3) restore the balance between oestrogens and progesterone in the endometrium, ensuring control of the menstrual cycle; and (4) provide adequate protection against the milieu of unopposed oestrogen that may exist in some women with PCOS which predisposes them to endometrial hyperplasia and adenocarcinoma of the endometrium.

Current PCOS guidelines state that COCs could be used in reproductive adults and adolescents with PCOS for the management of hirsutism and/or irregular menstrual cycles, but the guidelines do not currently recommend specific types or doses of progestin, oestrogen, or combinations in oral COC pills because there is only very low quality of evidence available. In terms of effectiveness in patients with hirsutism associated with PCOS, the lowest effective oestrogen doses (such as EE 0.02–0.03 mg or equivalent) can be considered first-choice COCs for the treatment of PCOS. In the case of the progestin DNG, it has been estimated that the antiandrogenic activity is about 30% of that of cyproterone acetate (CPA), the most potent antiandrogenic progestin.DNG + EE has been shown to be non-inferior to CPA + EE for the treatment of acne in a large randomised controlled trial. Moreover, the combination of low dose DNG + EE, as well as other antiandrogenic progestins in combination with EE, significantly reduces androgen levels, increases serum SHBG levels, and decreases total testosterone and free testosterone levels. Therefore, the DNG + EE combination has strong antiandrogenic potential but without the explicit warnings in the latest PCOS guidelines against first-line use of EE + CPA due to adverse effects including venous thromboembolic risks. In our current trial, favourable changes in circulating hormone levels were observed for participants in the DNG + EE group from baseline to the end of Cycle 9/EDV for free testosterone, testosterone, androstenedione, and FAI, as well as an increase in mean serum SHBG levels, which were not seen in the placebo group. Moreover, significant favourable decreases were observed for 17-OHP and DHEAS in the DNG + EE group compared with the placebo group. By using prolonged-release formulation of DNG + EE, the peak of exposure is reduced compared to immediate-release formulations and delayed by a few hours. This leads to a similar total systemic exposure with reduced peak intensity and therefore reduced hormonal fluctuations that result in a more predictable bleeding profile.

Who to treat

Candidates for testosterone therapy are postmenopausal women presenting with a decline in sexual interest with or without diminished arousal that causes sufficient personal or interpersonal concern (distress) that they seek treatment. Women should not receive testosterone therapy if they have signs of clinical androgen excess (i.e. acne, hirsutism, androgenic alopecia) or are using an antiandrogenic medication (e.g. finasteride, dutasteride). Testosterone treatment in women with hormone-dependent neoplasia should only be recommended in consultation with the specialist(s) providing the cancer care. Women with a high SHBG concentration are less likely to experience treatment benefit.

Although the Global Position Statement endorses testosterone therapy only for postmenopausal women, the ISSWSH POC for HSDD includes women in the late reproductive years, a recommendation supported by the physiology of decline in androgens and the efficacy data discussed previously.

Special populations

Antidepressant treatment-emergent sexual dysfunction

In the only RCT of women (n = 44), primarily premenopausal, experiencing selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor treatment-emergent loss of libido, transdermal testosterone increased the frequency of satisfying sexual events but did not show statistically significant changes on measures of sexual function and sexual distress. Therefore, the data are insufficient to recommend testosterone for treatment-emergent sexual dysfunction from selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors.

### Evaluation and treatment of women with hirsutism [^1112YUMa]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Hirsutism is a common disorder, often resulting from conditions that are not life-threatening. It may signal more serious clinical pathology, and clinical evaluation should differentiate benign causes from tumors or other conditions such as polycystic ovary syndrome, late-onset adrenal hyperplasia, and Cushing's syndrome. Laboratory testing should be based on the patient's history and physical findings, but screening for levels of serum testosterone and 17alpha-hydroxyprogesterone is sufficient in most cases. Women with irregular menses and hirsutism should be screened for thyroid dysfunction and prolactin disorders. Pharmacologic and/or nonpharmacologic treatments may be used. Advances in laser hair removal methods and topical hair growth retardants offer new options. The use of insulin-sensitizing agents may be useful in women with polycystic ovary syndrome.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) — hirsutism markers and management: Hirsutism, considering ethnic differences, is a good marker for hyperandrogenism (level B), whereas isolated acne and alopecia are not good markers and hirsutism should be evaluated biochemically (level B). Prolonged (> 6 months) medical therapy for hirsutism is necessary to document effectiveness (level B). Antiandrogens should not be used without effective contraception (level B); flutamide is of limited value because of its dose-dependent hepatotoxicity (level B), and drospirenone in the dosage used in some oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) is not antiandrogenic (level B). Often OCPs are prescribed in combination with an antiandrogen to block androgen action at the hair follicles, but the addition of an antiandrogen to OCPs has not appeared to increase the overall treatment benefit, although spironolactone, flutamide, and finasteride have been shown to reduce hirsutism. Insulin-sensitizing agents such as metformin and pioglitazone have little effect on hirsutism or acne. For dermatologic care, isotretinoin is not effective for hirsutism and occasionally may lead to alopecia; topical eflornithine hydrochloride can decrease development of new unwanted facial hair, and physical approaches such as electrolysis and laser may be acceptable. Many drugs used for hirsutism are not FDA approved for this indication (GPP), and no effective treatment for alopecia is known (level B).

### Efficacy and safety of anti-androgens in the management of polycystic ovary syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^115G55pY]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Lifestyle management is recommended as the first-line treatment option for PCOS. However, in some circumstances where lifestyle management is unsuccessful, pharmacological agents including the combined oral contraceptive pill (COCP), anti-obesity agents, metformin, and anti-androgen medications, could be employed for clinical management. The COCP is often prescribed for adult women with PCOS, for management of irregular menses and clinical hyperandrogenism (hirsutism and acne). Similarly, COCPs are recommended for adolescent girls diagnosed with PCOS and those considered to be "at risk for PCOS". Metformin has been used for ovulation induction, promotion of weight loss and/or maintenance, and reduction of pregnancy complications.

Anti-androgen medications such as spironolactone, flutamide, finasteride, and cyproterone acetate (CPA) have been utilised to decrease hyperandrogenism-related symptoms. Anti-androgen medications act in one of three ways; either by competitively inhibiting the androgen-binding receptors; decreasing androgen production (although the manner in which this occurs is not well-understood); or inhibiting 5-α-reductase in the skin, which is an enzyme that converts testosterone into its active form, 5-α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Spironolactone and finasteride are dose-dependent competitive inhibitors of the androgen receptor and have also been observed to inhibit 5-α-reductase activity. Other anti-androgens such as CPA, flutamide, and bicalutamide are thought to competitively inhibit testosterone binding to the androgen receptor. Via these mechanisms, anti-androgen medications could ameliorate the hyperandrogenic state of PCOS and improve the various hyperandrogenism-related symptoms associated with the condition.

### Screening and management of the hyperandrogenic adolescent: ACOG committee opinion, number 789 [^1164uEVK]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). High credibility.

Hyperandrogenic adolescent — hirsutism management includes antiandrogens, insulin-sensitizers, and topical agents. Antiandrogens prevent testosterone and other androgens from expressing their activity and can be used to enhance combined hormonal therapy; spironolactone is approved for hirsutism and works via androgen receptor and 5α-reductase inhibition, with typical doses ranging from 50 to 200 mg daily, and adverse effects including diuresis, hypotension, and risk of hyperkalemia; because spironolactone may affect the genital development of a male fetus, it should be used with contraception in patients who engage in sexual activity that could result in pregnancy. Other antiandrogens such as flutamide have similar efficacy but are used less commonly because of potential hepatotoxicity, and there are limited data for finasteride in adolescents. Metformin may reduce serum androgens and can be used for insulin resistance in adolescents with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS); in adolescents randomized to metformin or spironolactone both improved hirsutism but spironolactone showed a greater benefit, whereas a meta-analysis of four trials in adolescent females found oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) and metformin were similar in effect on hirsutism. For facial hirsutism, eflornithine cream is approved and continuous topical administration slows facial hair growth, but use is limited to small areas and hair growth recurs when discontinued.

Definition of terms — local and patient-important hirsutism, hyperandrogenism, idiopathic hirsutism, and hypertrichosis distinction: Local hair growth is unwanted localized hair growth in the absence of an abnormal hirsutism score, and patient-important hirsutism is unwanted sexual hair growth of any degree that causes sufficient distress for women to seek additional treatment. For this guideline, hyperandrogenism is defined as clinical features that result from increased androgen production and/or action, and idiopathic hirsutism is hirsutism without hyperandrogenemia or other signs or symptoms indicative of a hyperandrogenic endocrine disorder. Hirsutism must be distinguished from hypertrichosis — generalized excessive hair growth that may be hereditary or medication related — which is distributed in a generalized, nonsexual pattern and is not caused by excess androgen.

### Additive effects of insulin-sensitizing and anti-androgen treatment in young, nonobese women with hyperinsulinism, hyperandrogenism, dyslipidemia, and anovulation [^1155VpCR]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2002). Low credibility.

The endocrine-metabolic hallmarks of polycystic ovary syndrome are hyperinsulinism, hyperandrogenism, dyslipidemia, and anovulation. We hypothesized that dyslipidemia and anovulation in nonobese women with polycystic ovary syndrome are essentially secondary to the concerted effects of hyperandrogenism and insulin resistance. We tested this hypothesis by comparing the efficacy of anti-androgen (flutamide) or insulin-sensitizing (metformin) monotherapy to that of combined therapy in normalizing the endocrine-metabolic and anovulatory status of nonobese, young women with hyperinsulinemic hyperandrogenism. Thirty-one young women (mean age, 18.7 yr; body mass index, 21.9 kg/m(2); hirsutism score, 16; monthly ovulation rate monitored by weekly serum progesterone, 10%) were randomly assigned to receive once daily flutamide (250 mg; n = 10), metformin (1275 mg; n = 8), or combined flutamide- metformin therapy (n = 13) for 9 months. At baseline, there were no endocrine-metabolic differences among treatment groups. Compared with monotherapy, combined flutamide-metformin therapy resulted in greater improvements in insulin sensitivity, in testosterone, androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, and triglyceride levels, and in low-density lipoprotein/high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol ratio (all P < 0.005). Monthly ovulation rates increased after 9 months to 75 and 92%, respectively, with metformin alone or with combined therapy, but were unimproved with flutamide alone. All treatments were well tolerated. In conclusion, combined anti-androgen and insulin-sensitizing treatment in young, nonobese women with hyperinsulinemic hyperandrogenism had additive benefits on insulin sensitivity, hyperandrogenemia, and dyslipidemia. The data from this small study suggest that dyslipidemia is secondary to excess androgen action in concert with the hyperinsulinemia associated with insulin resistance. In contrast, anovulation seems to be mainly attributable to insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia.

GRADE recommendation strength — classification and application: Recommendations according to the GRADE framework are "either strong (GRADE 1) or weak (GRADE 2)". Strong recommendations are those that "should be applied consistently to most patients", while weak recommendations are "conditional recommendations that may not apply to all patients; variation in implementing these recommendations is acceptable". Strong recommendations are "typically reserved for situations when the confidence in the estimates is moderate or high", with an exception when low-quality evidence supports concern about cost or harm such that developers "recommend against using the intervention". In this guideline, the Task Force "recommended against using androgens in settings with unproven benefit (low-quality evidence) and concern about harm and cost (recommendations 1.0, 2.1, 2.2, 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3)", and notes that "patient values, preferences, and context, should play a major role in determining how and when to apply them".

Diagnosis of hirsutism — Endocrine Society recommendations emphasize that clinicians should evaluate biochemical hyperandrogenism when clinical suspicion is present and avoid low-yield testing: we suggest testing for elevated androgen levels in all women with an abnormal hirsutism score and, when total testosterone is normal but hair growth is moderate/severe or mild with other hyperandrogenic features, we suggest measuring an early morning serum total and free testosterone by a reliable specialty assay; we suggest screening hyperandrogenemic women for nonclassic congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency with early morning 17-hydroxyprogesterone, including in high-risk hirsute patients even if serum total and free testosterone are normal; and we suggest against testing for elevated androgen levels in eumenorrheic women with unwanted local hair growth without an abnormal hirsutism score because of low diagnostic yield.

a Inhibition of steroidogenesis in the adrenals, ovaries and/or peripheral tissues, including skin, reduces serum levels of androgens and androgen precursors

Four of the RCTs evaluated spironolactone in combination with a COC. Hirsutism or PCOS was the primary diagnosis and acne was the secondary diagnosis. Since COCs are potent anti-androgens, and are effective as monotherapy for acne, superiority of the combination needs to be demonstrated over the COC alone. Despite this, only one trial included a COC monotherapy arm and found no benefit of adding spironolactone to norgestimate/EE, although, at trend, the combination was more effective. In this three-arm trial, treatment allocation was unbalanced, with three times as many women in the combination arm as those receiving COC monotherapy. Any added benefit of spironolactone might have been revealed had treatment arms been of equal size.

One potentially more useful trial put spironolactone head-to-head against oral tetracycline and found no difference in efficacy over 8 weeks of treatment; however, caution is necessary in interpreting the results as this trial was also unbalanced, with 63 women receiving spironolactone but only 14 receiving tetracycline. Interestingly, the duration of therapy was consistently short (2–3 months) for those RCTs in which acne was the primary diagnosis, and much longer (9–12 months) for the trials in which hirsutism was the primary diagnosis. After only 3 months of treatment, the response of acne to spironolactone may not be optimal. The case series show that clinicians often use longer courses to manage acne in the real world. Using the PP population, improvement rates were significantly higher in the case series compared with those RCTs that had also used an outcome measure that could be dichotomized. This difference in efficacy rates may be an indication that longer treatment is likely to be more successful.

### Evaluation and management of hirsutism in women… [^115qNBxN]. AAFP (2004). Low credibility.

Hirsutism affects between 5 to 15 percent of adult women surveyed for the condition. The excessive growth of coarse hair in a male-like pattern can cause significant distress and have multiple negative consequences for patients. Hyperandrogenism usually causes hirsutism. A review by Azziz stresses the need for a systematic evaluation of the patient and use of combination therapy. The first step in the evaluation of hirsutism is confirmation of excessive coarse hairs in a male-like pattern, because many patients who complain of excessive hair growth do not have true hirsutism. Several scoring systems have been developed, but they must be adapted to the ethnic and cultural group to which each patient belongs, because body hair is regarded very differently by different cultures. The second step involves the identification of the disorders that could contribute to the etiology or complicate the management of hirsutism. The most common causes of hirsutism are androgenic. Approximately 70 to 80 percent of women with androgen excess have hirsutism. The most common cause of androgen excess is polycystic ovary syndrome. Rarer androgenic causes include the insulin-resistant acanthosis nigricans syndrome, some forms of adrenal hyperplasia, and ovarian or adrenal androgen-secreting tumors. Approximately 5 to 15 percent of hirsutism cases are idiopathic. Some of these women are believed to have enzyme overactivity in the hair follicles, causing hirsutism in spite of normal circulating hormone levels.

Establishing the etiology of hirsutism depends on a thorough medical and menstrual history plus a physical examination, followed by laboratory and other diagnostic tests targeting the most probable cause for the individual patient. Appropriate tests may include thyroid function; basal 17-hydroxyprogesterone level during the follicular phase of menstruation to exclude nonclassic adrenal hyperplasia; blood glucose and insulin levels; and measures of circulating androgen levels. Pharmacologic treatment is directed at the underlying cause of hirsutism, with special attention given to associated risk factors. More than one half of women with PCOS are at significant risk of insulin resistance and diabetes. Suppression of ovarian androgens usually is obtained through the use of combined oral contraceptives. Use of estrogens alone in appropriate women has been recommended.

Oral contraceptives may be combined with long-acting gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogs, such as Lupron Depot in a dosage of 3. 75 mg per month, but this approach generally requires two to three cycles for effect. Insulin resistance may respond to weight loss or therapy with metformin or troglitazone, but the effect on hirsutism may be modest. The most effective treatments combine androgen suppression with peripheral androgen blockade. Androgen-receptor blockers include spironolactone, flutamide, finasteride, and cyproterone acetate. These drugs have teratogenic potential and require secure contraception. In addition to medical treatments, most women with hirsutism seek local treatments to minimize the appearance of unwanted hair. Shaving does not increase hair growth. Depilating agents can cause chronic skin irritation. Mechanical hair removal by waxing or plucking is discouraged because of the risk of trauma, ingrown hairs, and folliculitis.

### An approach to the patient with hirsutism [^1143XS66]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

Hirsutism is a common endocrinological complaint. The causes of this complaint can vary from dissatisfaction with a normal pattern of hair growth on the one hand, to the first clinical manifestation of androgen overproduction by an adrenal adenocarcinoma on the other. The purpose of this short review is to reexamine the physiology of hair growth in normal women, identify the common abnormal patterns, and explore the differential diagnosis associated with each. An approach to working through the differential diagnosis will be described, and the commonly available treatment modalities for the various forms of hirsutism will be examined in terms of risk and benefit. The review is written from the point of view of the physician and the most efficient, cost effective, and safe clinical approach to the patient with the problem.

Participants

At screening, all participants were assessed for the diagnosis of clinical hyperandrogenism (adapted modified Ferriman-Gallwey (mFG) score of ≥ 7 (a score of 28 was considered the most severe; see below for full description) plus oligomenorrhea (≤ 6 menses per year) while not using hormonal contraceptives and/or polycystic ovary morphology defined as the presence of ≥ 12 follicles measuring 2–9 mm located throughout the entire ovary or an ovarian volume ≥ 10 cm 3 determined by intravaginal ultrasound (transabdominal ultrasound examination could be used for adolescents). Participants with other disorders and aetiologies of ovulatory dysfunction and hyperandrogenism were excluded. In this trial, all participants were in good physical and mental health, with a BMI 18– < 35 kg/m 2 and systolic/diastolic blood pressure of ≤ 140/90 mmHg. Women who were pregnant, wishing to get pregnant or were breastfeeding were not eligible to enrol, neither were current smokers ≥ 36 years with a BMI > 30 kg/m 2. All participants consented to use reliable non-hormonal contraception methods (condoms, female or male sterilisation or sexual abstinence) for the duration of the trial. Women with abnormal gynaecological examination findings on pelvic, breast or intravaginal ultrasound examination (or transabdominal ultrasound examination for adolescents) that in the investigator's opinion contraindicated participation in the trial were excluded. In addition, participants with type 2 diabetes and haemoglobin A1C > 6.5% (treatment with metformin was allowed only if the dose had been stable for at least 3 months prior to screening), anaemia with haemoglobin < 10 g/dL, or the presence or risk of venous or arterial thromboembolism were also not eligible for enrolment. A full list of inclusion and exclusion criteria are listed in Appendix S2.

### Screening and management of the hyperandrogenic adolescent: ACOG committee opinion, number 789 [^112HgSfp]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). High credibility.

ACOG Committee Opinion No. 789 — Recommendations and conclusions for the hyperandrogenic adolescent state that reports of hirsutism and acne should be taken seriously because of their possible association with medical disorders, their substantial effect on self-esteem and quality of life, and the potential for psychosocial morbidity. The diagnosis of hyperandrogenism can be based on clinical symptoms or measurement of serum androgens, and there are no clear consensus guidelines on the diagnostic criteria for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in adolescent girls within 2 years of menarche; thus, obstetrician–gynecologists should exercise caution in assigning this diagnosis prematurely. Treatment of acne and hirsutism should not be withheld during the ongoing longitudinal evaluation for possible PCOS, and pelvic ultrasonography is not routinely indicated unless serum androgen levels or the degree of virilization is concerning for an ovarian tumor. The finding of polycystic ovarian morphology on ultrasonography has a prevalence in adolescent girls of 30–40% and alone is not predictive of the presence or future development of PCOS, and multimodal therapy is the most effective approach to the treatment of hirsutism, including lifestyle changes, physical hair removal, and androgen suppression or blockade with medication that slows or prevents new hair growth.

### Are the endocrine society's clinical practice guidelines on androgen therapy in women misguided? A commentary [^113fjzko]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

The Endocrine Society Clinical Guidelines on Androgen Therapy in Women (henceforth referred to as the Guidelines) do not necessarily represent the opinion held by the many health-care professionals and clinicians who are specialized in the evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment of women's health in androgen insufficiency states. The recommendations provided in the published Guidelines are neither accurate nor complete. We disagree with the therapeutic nihilism promoted by these Guidelines. The members of the Guidelines Panel (henceforth referred to as the Panel), in their own disclaimer, stated that the Guidelines do not establish a standard of care. Based on data available in the contemporary literature, on the role of androgens in women's health, we provide in this commentary a point-by-point discussion of the arguments made by the Panel in arriving at their recommendations. It is our view that the Guidelines are not based on the preponderance of scientific evidence. Health-care professionals, physicians, and scientists often disagree when determining how best to address and manage new and emerging clinical issues. This is where we stand now as we endeavor to understand the role of androgens in a woman's health and welfare. Indeed, some basic facts are not in contention. All agree that dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S) production from the adrenal gland begins during the preteen years, peaks in the mid 20s, then declines progressively over time. In contrast, ovarian androgen (i.e., testosterone) secretion commences at puberty, is sustained during a woman's peak reproductive years and declines as a woman ages, with a more rapid and steep decrease after surgical menopause. However, there are ample data to suggest that adrenal androgens play a role in the development of axillary and pubic hair, and that testosterone is critical for women's libido and sexual function. We take this opportunity to invite members of the Panel on Androgen Therapy in Women to discuss, clarify, comment, or rebut any of the points made in this Commentary. It is our goal to elevate this debate in order to provide women who are afflicted with androgen insufficiency and sexual disorders with the highest quality health care and to relieve their distress and suffering, as well as to improve their quality of life.

### Efficacy and safety of anti-androgens in the management of polycystic ovary syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^114UJ5rY]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Several limitations in the literature were apparent. Most notably, significant heterogeneity in the included studies and variations in methodological quality were evident, with many studies having small sample sizes and varied interventions, comparators, doses, frequencies, and population characteristics. This was reflected in the GRADE certainty of evidence, which was classified as very low or low for the majority of outcomes. Given that the 20 included studies represented 12 different comparisons, this heterogeneity precluded meta-analysis for many comparisons, with limited sensitivity analyses, and we were unable to perform sub-group stratification by important variables including age, weight/BMI, insulin resistance, lifestyle variables or severity of symptoms, given the small sample sizes across most comparisons. In addition, separate assessments of specific anti-androgens were not possible and there were insufficient studies in adolescents (n = 2 trials) to allow for meaningful comparisons. For these reasons, the results presented herein may not reflect the real-life experiences of all patients with PCOS or their treating clinicians, and treatments should be tailored to individual needs and preferences. In the meantime, further high-quality, well-powered RCTs are needed to clarify the effects of anti-androgens in women with PCOS with greater certainty. In particular, given that only two studies were identified in adolescents in this review, studies of adolescents as well as 'at risk' populations (adolescents with PCOS features, but not meeting formal diagnostic criteria) are lacking and this remains a key gap in the evidence. Other research priorities include large-scale studies comparing efficacy of different anti-androgen types, doses, combinations and treatment schedules, as well as optimal monitoring methods for adverse events. Studies should be sufficiently sized to allow for exploration of efficacy among specific phenotypes and by important variables including weight, age and metabolic parameters. For comparisons that show differences, validation in large scale population-based studies would be of value.

Table 3
Summary of meta-analysis results examining the use of anti-androgens in polycystic ovary syndrome.

Overall, sample sizes varied from 11 to 167 participants, with treatment durations ranging from six to 12 months. Studies were conducted in Italy (n = 7), Spain (n = 3), Brazil (n = 2), Iran (n = 2), India (n = 2), Australia (n = 1), Israel (n = 1), Turkey (n = 1), and the United States of America (n = 1). Anti-androgen medications included spironolactone, finasteride, flutamide, and bicalutamide, with comparators including placebo, metformin, COCP, lifestyle, or a combination of these. Most of the included studies were in adults, with two in adolescents. The mean BMI of participants ranged from healthy (18.5–24.9 kg/m 2) to overweight (25.0–29.9 kg/m 2) and obese (≥ 30.0 kg/m 2), but most studies were in women with a BMI ≥ 25.0 kg/m 2. Methods of contraception included abstinence, barrier, or hormonal contraceptives as part of the intervention or comparison, and were reported in all studies (as this was an eligibility criterion).

In quality appraisal, four studies were classified as being of low RoB, nine were moderate, and seven were high risk. The most common reasons for high RoB ratings were the lack of concealed or centralised allocation, absence of participant and/or investigator blinding, high drop-out rate, and lack of pre-registered protocols (Table S1). In the GRADE assessments, the certainty of evidence in the reported outcomes mostly ranged from very low to low, due to concerns regarding RoB, small sample sizes (imprecision), and statistical heterogeneity (inconsistency), with very few outcomes ranging from moderate to high (detailed in the Supplementary Material).

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) — conclusions on oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) note that OCPs are a key component in the treatment of PCOS, but only a few studies assess metabolic effects and there are even fewer RCTs with small numbers and limited follow‑up; long‑term risks and benefits of nonoral routes, combinations with antiandrogens or insulin sensitizers, and progestin‑only contraceptives remain largely unknown; larger randomized, controlled studies are needed; despite uncertainties, current evidence supports the benefits of long‑term OCP use in PCOS, OCP use might increase the risk of diabetes particularly in obese patients with severe insulin resistance, and WHO contraindication guidelines should be observed in women with PCOS.

Hyperandrogenism in adolescents — counseling, weight management, and hormonal therapy are outlined as follows: All patients who present with clinical hyperandrogenism should be counseled on a healthy lifestyle, and weight loss in obese patients with hyperandrogenemia with or without PCOS has been shown to decrease androgen levels, increase sex hormone binding globulin, and reduce clinical hirsutism. Ethinyl estradiol increases sex hormone binding globulin, reducing free testosterone, and similar effects have been shown with the patch and vaginal ring formulations; among formulations, OCPs containing third-generation progestins (desogestrel, gestodene, norgestimate) have less androgenic activity than second-generation progestins (levonorgestrel), and drospirenone is frequently used with the amount in OCPs equivalent to 25 mg of spironolactone. No combined hormonal contraceptive has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of hirsutism. Patients should be counseled that given the life span of terminal hair, 6 months of medical therapy is required before slower and finer regrowth is noted, hormonal therapy should not be started before menarche, and once initiated it may take 6 months before benefits are seen.

Endocrine Practice (2015). Low credibility.

Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is recognized as the most common endocrine disorder of reproductive-aged women around the world. This document, produced by the collaboration of the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) and the Androgen Excess and PCOS Society (AES) aims to highlight the most important clinical issues confronting physicians and their patients with PCOS. It is a summary of current best practices in 2015. PCOS has been defined using various criteria, including menstrual irregularity, hyperandrogenism, and polycystic ovary morphology (PCOM). General agreement exists among specialty society guidelines that the diagnosis of PCOS must be based on the presence of at least two of the following three criteria: chronic anovulation, hyperandrogenism (clinical or biological) and polycystic ovaries. There is need for careful clinical assessment of women's history, physical examination, and laboratory evaluation, emphasizing the accuracy and validity of the methodology used for both biochemical measurements and ovarian imaging. Free testosterone (T) levels are more sensitive than the measurement of total T for establishing the existence of androgen excess and should be ideally determined through equilibrium dialysis techniques. Value of measuring levels of androgens other than T in patients with PCOS is relatively low. New ultrasound machines allow diagnosis of PCOM in patients having at least 25 small follicles (2 to 9 mm) in the whole ovary. Ovarian size at 10 mL remains the threshold between normal and increased ovary size. Serum 17-hydroxyprogesterone and anti-Müllerian hormone are useful for determining a diagnosis of PCOS. Correct diagnosis of PCOS impacts on the likelihood of associated metabolic and cardiovascular risks and leads to appropriate intervention, depending upon the woman's age, reproductive status, and her own concerns. The management of women with PCOS should include reproductive function, as well as the care of hirsutism, alopecia, and acne. Cycle length > 35 days suggests chronic anovulation, but cycle length slightly longer than normal (32 to 35 days) or slightly irregular (32 to 35–36 days) needs assessment for ovulatory dysfunction. Ovulatory dysfunction is associated with increased prevalence of endometrial hyperplasia and endometrial cancer, in addition to infertility. In PCOS, hirsutism develops gradually and intensifies with weight gain. In the neoplastic virilizing states, hirsutism is of rapid onset, usually associated with clitoromegaly and oligomenorrhea. Girls with severe acne or acne resistant to oral and topical agents, including isotretinoin (Accutane), may have a 40% likelihood of developing PCOS. Hair loss patterns are variable in women with hyperandrogenemia, typically the vertex, crown or diffuse pattern, whereas women with more severe hyperandrogenemia may see bitemporal hair loss and loss of the frontal hairline. Oral contraceptives (OCPs) can effectively lower androgens and block the effect of androgens via suppression of ovarian androgen production and by increasing sex hormone-binding globulin. Physiologic doses of dexamethasone or prednisone can directly lower adrenal androgen output. Anti-androgens can be used to block the effects of androgen in the pilosebaceous unit or in the hair follicle. Anti-androgen therapy works through competitive antagonism of the androgen receptor (spironolactone, cyproterone acetate, flutamide) or inhibition of 5α-reductase (finasteride) to prevent the conversion of T to its more potent form, 5α-dihydrotestosterone. The choice of antiandrogen therapy is guided by symptoms. The diagnosis of PCOS in adolescents is particularly challenging given significant age and developmental issues in this group. Management of infertility in women with PCOS requires an understanding of the pathophysiology of anovulation as well as currently available treatments. Many features of PCOS, including acne, menstrual irregularities, and hyperinsulinemia, are common in normal puberty. Menstrual irregularities with anovulatory cycles and varied cycle length are common due to the immaturity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis in the 2- to 3-year time period post-menarche. Persistent oligomenorrhea 2 to 3 years beyond menarche predicts ongoing menstrual irregularities and greater likelihood of underlying ovarian or adrenal dysfunction. In adolescent girls, large, multicystic ovaries are a common finding, so ultrasound is not a first-line investigation in women < 17 years of age. Ovarian dysfunction in adolescents should be based on oligomenorrhea and/or biochemical evidence of oligo/anovulation, but there are major limitations to the sensitivity of T assays in ranges applicable to young girls. Metformin is commonly used in young girls and adolescents with PCOS as first-line monotherapy or in combination with OCPs and anti-androgen medications. In lean adolescent girls, a dose as low as 850 mg daily may be effective at reducing PCOS symptoms; in overweight and obese adolescents, dose escalation to 1.5 to 2.5 g daily is likely required. Anti-androgen therapy in adolescents could affect bone mass, although available short-term data suggest no effect on bone loss.

Treatment of adolescents

3.11 We suggest HCs as the first-line treatment in adolescents with suspected PCOS (if the therapeutic goal is to treat acne, hirsutism, or anovulatory symptoms or to prevent pregnancy) (2|⊕⊕○○). We suggest that lifestyle therapy (calorie-restricted diet and exercise) with the objective of weight loss should also be first-line treatment in the presence of overweight/obesity (2|⊕⊕○○). We suggest metformin as a possible treatment if the goal is to treat IGT/metabolic syndrome (2|⊕⊕○○). The optimal duration of HC or metformin use has not yet been determined.

3.12 For premenarchal girls with clinical and biochemical evidence of hyperandrogenism in the presence of advanced pubertal development (ie, ≥ Tanner stage IV breast development), we suggest starting HCs (2|⊕⊕○○).

3.11–3.12 Evidence

The treatment of PCOS in adolescents is controversial. Many support the symptom-driven approach, whereas others support an approach targeting the underlying reproductive/hormonal and metabolic abnormalities associated with PCOS. There are no adequately powered, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in adolescents with PCOS. The dual goal of treating hyperandrogenism and providing contraception prompts the use of HCs as the mainstay of therapy for adolescents with PCOS. Additionally, benefits such as normal menses and decreased acne and hirsutism are typically of the greatest importance to an adolescent. Some of these can also be improved by lifestyle therapy and weight loss.

Nonetheless, the initiation of HCs in early adolescence is controversial, and few data exist to guide recommendations. After excluding other causes of primary amenorrhea, HCs could be considered in a patient with proven hyperandrogenism if the patient has achieved a sexual maturity of Tanner stage 4–5 when menarche should have occurred. The best HC for adolescents and the appropriate duration of therapy are uncertain. A longer duration of treatment with a combined HC may lead to a lower chance of developing signs of hyperandrogenism as an adult. Some authors suggest continuing with HC until the patient is gynecologically mature (defined by these authors as 5 years postmenarcheal) or has lost a substantial amount of weight.

Management of nonfertility features

Regardless of whether an adolescent is diagnosed with PCOS or is "at risk" for PCOS, specific individual concerns should guide interventions. The first management step involves a decision-making discussion with the adolescent and parents/guardians to identify specific treatment goals. The topics that merit discussion include the following: (1) lifestyle changes, (2) the use of combined oral contraceptive pills (COCP) and metformin for PCOS is evidence-based, (3) both COCP and metformin are generally "off-label" for PCOS, and (4) considerations of other interventions.

COCP could be considered for the management of hirsutism and/or menstrual irregularities in adolescents with or "at risk" of PCOS according to 10 studies (420 adolescents). Metformin alone could be considered in adolescents with or "at risk" of PCOS for cycle regulation, acknowledging limited evidence (six studies [185 adolescents]). Metformin could be used over COCP for metabolic features and COCP could be used over metformin for hirsutism and/or menstrual irregularities based on four studies (142 adolescents). The combination of COCPs and metformin in those with a body mass index < 30 kg/m 2 has minimal additional benefit in women with no data in adolescents. The role of antiandrogens is limited according to 26 studies (two studies in adolescents that used antiandrogens combined with two insulin sensitizers) (Table 4).

No specific adolescent recommendations were made for anti-obesity medications and cosmetic therapies due to lack of data in this population. However, anti-obesity medications have beneficial effects in individuals with obesity and there is some evidence in PCOS. Additionally, laser and light therapy are effective treatments for hirsutism and related psychological features according to eight studies in adults with PCOS. Inositol preparations cannot currently be recommended in adolescents as no data exist in this population and only biochemical efficacy has been demonstrated in adults with PCOS (Table 4).

### Antiandrogen therapy for the treatment of female pattern hair loss: a clinical review of current and emerging therapies [^113jh7kq]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Androgenetic alopecia is the most common hair loss type in women, but topical minoxidil is the only Food and Drug Administration-approved treatment option. The pathophysiology involves shortened anagen phases, lengthened telogen phases, and hair follicle miniaturization. Androgens, particularly dihydrotestosterone, play a crucial role in male androgenetic alopecia pathogenesis, but their exact role in female pattern hair loss is unclear. Oral antiandrogens demonstrate some efficacy in women, albeit with considerations for side effects and contraindications. Topical antiandrogens may be used in combination with topical minoxidil or as alternatives to oral medications, likely with fewer systemic adverse effects. Patient-specific factors, including age, signs of hyperandrogenism, or need for contraception may help determine which antiandrogen therapy is most appropriate. This review focuses on current antiandrogen treatments for female pattern hair loss available in the United States and their limitations, as well as emerging treatments that are investigational, studied in other hair loss types, or available in other countries.

2.2 Selection criteria

The PICO was defined with input from women and experts as noted above.

The population relevant for this systematic review were females with PCOS diagnosed by Rotterdam, National Institute of Health (NIH) or Androgen Excess Society (AES) (now Androgen Excess and PCOS [AE‐PCOS] Society) criteria. Exclusion criteria were women less than 2 years postmenarche, and women with important comorbidities including type 2 diabetes and major depression.

Interventions included all types of COCP with a treatment duration of at least 3 months, however, to assess the outcome hirsutism, a minimum of 6 months treatment was required. Comparisons were no medical treatment, including controls (no treatment), placebo or lifestyle intervention.

The outcomes that a priori had been prioritised, were clinical androgenicity (hirsutism as indicated by Ferriman Gallwey [FG] score), biochemical androgenicity (free androgen index [FAI], testosterone, SHBG, dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate [DHEAS], androstenedione), irregular cycles, metabolic outcomes (Homoeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance [HOMA‐IR], clamptest, oral glucose tolerance test [OGTT], cholesterol, low density lipoprotein (LDL), high density lipoprotein (HDL), triglycerides, C‐reactive protein [CRP]), psychological outcomes (HRQoL, depression), anthropometric outcomes (weight, BMI, waist‐hip ratio), thromboembolic events, plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI)‐1 levels and adverse effects. The outcome was included in the systematic review regardless of effect estimate.

Only randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were included.

Studies were selected and appraised by reviewers (M. F. J. M. S. A.), using study selection and appraisal criteria established a priori, in the tool Covidence. The articles were first reviewed by title and abstract by two reviewers. If no decision could be reached based on title and abstract alone, the full text was also retrieved. Only studies that were unsuitable for the PICO for any of the three medical treatments were excluded. Full‐text screening was done by two reviewers (M. F. J. M. S. A.). Conflicts were resolved by discussion. In addition to the studies included in previous guidelines, the excluded list from that search was reviewed, and studies were included if they met PICO criteria, for comprehensiveness. Systematic reviews and evidence‐based guidelines were not included but screened manually for additional references.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) — contraception with oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) encompasses chronic management benefits and mechanisms: OCPs are the mainstay for women not seeking pregnancy, improve hyperandrogenic skin manifestations, regulate menstrual cycles, and lower endometrial carcinoma risk; they suppress LH, increase SHBG with decreased free T, antagonize androgen action, and may decrease adrenal androgens. Progestin androgenicity varies (norethindrone, norgestrel, levonorgestrel more androgenic; desogestrel, norgestimate, gestodene less), and antiandrogenic progestin combinations (ethinyl estradiol with cyproterone acetate) have been most studied, with few studies of drospirenone or chlormadinone and none with dienogest in PCOS. Overall, OCPs are effective for long-term management, but concerns remain about potential long-term risks related to cardiovascular disease and glucose intolerance.

### American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists, American college of endocrinology, and androgen excess and pcos society disease state clinical review: guide to the best practices in the evaluation and treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome-part 2 [^1175qogk]. Endocrine Practice (2015). Low credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is recognized as the most common endocrine disorder of reproductive-aged women around the world. This document, produced by the collaboration of the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and the Androgen Excess Society aims to highlight the most important clinical issues confronting physicians and their patients with PCOS. It is a summary of current best practices in 2014. Insulin resistance is believed to play an intrinsic role in the pathogenesis of PCOS. The mechanism by which insulin resistance or insulin give rise to oligomenorrhea and hyperandrogenemia, however, is unclear. Hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp studies have shown that both obese and lean women with PCOS have some degree of insulin resistance. Insulin resistance is implicated in the ovulatory dysfunction of PCOS by disrupting the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis. Given the association with insulin resistance, all women with PCOS require evaluation for the risk of metabolic syndrome (MetS) and its components, including type 2 diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and the possible risk of clinical events, including acute myocardial infarction and stroke. Obese women with PCOS are at increased risk for MetS with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT; 31 to 35%) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM; 7.5 to 10%). Rates of progression from normal glucose tolerance to IGT, and in turn to T2DM, may be as high as 5 to 15% within 3 years. Data suggest the need for baseline oral glucose tolerance test every 1 to 2 years based on family history of T2DM as well as body mass index (BMI) and yearly in women with IGT. Compared with BMI- and age-matched controls, young, lean PCOS women have lower high-density lipoprotein (HDL) size, higher very-low-density lipoprotein particle number, higher low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particle number, and borderline lower LDL size. Statins have been shown to lower testosterone levels either alone or in combination with oral contraceptives (OCPs) but have not shown improvement in menses, spontaneous ovulation, hirsutism, or acne. Statins reduce total and LDL cholesterol but have no effect on HDL, C-reactive protein, fasting insulin, or homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance in PCOS women, in contrast to the general population. There have been no long-term studies of statins on clinical cardiac outcomes in women with PCOS. Coronary calcification is more prevalent and more severe in PCOS than in controls. In women under 60 years of age undergoing coronary angiography, the presence of polycystic ovaries on sonography has been associated with more arterial segments with > 50% stenosis, but the relationship between PCOS and actual cardiovascular events remains unclear. Therapies for PCOS are varied in their effects and targets and include both nonpharmacologic as well as pharmacologic approaches. Weight loss is the primary therapy in PCOS — reduction in weight of as little as 5% can restore regular menses and improve response to ovulation- inducing and fertility medications. Metformin in premenopausal PCOS women has been associated with a reduction in features of MetS. Clamp studies using ethinyl estradiol/drosperinone combination failed to reveal evidence of an increase in either peripheral or hepatic insulin resistance. Subjects with PCOS have a 1.5-times higher baseline risk of venous thromboembolic disease and a 3.7-fold greater effect with OCP use compared with non-PCOS subjects. There is currently no genetic test to screen for or diagnose PCOS, and there is no test to assist in the choice of treatment strategies. Persistent bleeding should always be investigated for pregnancy and/or uterine pathology — including transvaginal ultrasound exam and endometrial biopsy — in women with PCOS. PCOS women can have difficulty conceiving. Those who become pregnant are at risk for gestational diabetes (which should be evaluated and managed appropriately) and the microvascular complications of diabetes. Assessment of a woman with PCOS for infertility involves evaluating for preconceptional issues that may affect response to therapy or lead to adverse pregnancy outcomes and evaluating the couple for other common infertility issues that may affect the choice of therapy, such as a semen analysis. Women with PCOS have multiple factors that may lead to an elevated risk of pregnancy, including a high prevalence of IGT — a clear risk factor for gestational diabetes — and MetS with hypertension, which increases the risk for pre-eclampsia and placental abruption. Women should be screened and treated for hypertension and diabetes prior to attempting conception. Women should be counseled about weight loss prior to attempting conception, although there are limited clinical trial data demonstrating a benefit to this recommendation. Treatment for women with PCOS and anovulatory infertility should begin with an oral agent such as clomiphene citrate or letrozole, an aromatase inhibitor.

Estrogen and antiandrogen therapy in transgender females — expected changes and timelines: Physical changes may occur in the first 3 to 12 months of estrogen and antiandrogen therapy including decreased sexual desire, decreased spontaneous erections, decreased facial and body hair (usually mild), decreased oiliness of skin, increased breast tissue growth, and redistribution of fat mass; breast development is generally maximal at 2 years after initiating hormones, over a longer period of time the prostate gland and testicles will undergo atrophy, and there have been no well-designed studies of the role of progestogens in feminizing hormone regimens.
