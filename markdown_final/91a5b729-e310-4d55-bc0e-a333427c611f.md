## Question

Management of lactic acidosis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the management of lactic acidosis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate stabilization and diagnostic confirmation. Then, I should classify the type of lactic acidosis and identify the underlying cause. Next, I will review supportive care, including fluids, vasopressors, and ventilation. After that, I need to examine the role and risks of sodium bicarbonate and when, if ever, to use it. Then, I will consider renal replacement therapy, especially for metformin-associated cases. Finally, I will address special scenarios, monitoring and reassessment, and synthesize a pragmatic algorithm with key takeaways.

> Let me first confirm priorities in the first hour: secure airway and breathing, establish reliable IV access, and initiate continuous hemodynamic monitoring while sending stat labs including lactate, ABG, basic metabolic panel, anion gap, and glucose. I should also obtain a focused history and exam to identify precipitants such as sepsis, hypovolemia, medications, or liver disease, because lactate is both a diagnostic and prognostic marker in sepsis and shock and should be measured early and serially [^111BdPwn] [^112Ld1ix] [^115G8oLL].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — classification matters because treatment hinges on etiology. Type A reflects tissue hypoxia from shock, sepsis, or hypoxemia, whereas type B occurs without hypoxia and includes drug-induced (metformin, beta-agonists), malignancy-related, hepatic failure, mitochondrial disease, and impaired clearance. I should double-check for medication exposures, especially metformin and frequent albuterol, and consider malignancy when lactate is high with stable hemodynamics [^116kvqZe] [^114vTChN] [^113F3PGr].

> Next, I should review supportive care fundamentals: start balanced crystalloids for hypovolemia, titrate vasopressors to restore perfusion, and optimize ventilation to maintain adequate oxygenation and CO2 clearance. Wait, let me verify the role of lactate-guided resuscitation — SSC suggests using lactate to guide resuscitation in sepsis, and lactate clearance correlates with survival, so serial lactate trends should inform ongoing therapy and escalation decisions [^115asmtM] [^1169W9Y1].

> I will now examine sodium bicarbonate, because this is where practice often diverges from evidence. Routine bicarbonate for lactic acidosis does not improve hemodynamics or mortality, and may worsen intracellular acidosis via CO2 generation and cause hypocalcemia, so I should avoid it for pH ≥ 7.15. But wait, what if pH is very low with AKI — SSC issues a weak suggestion for bicarbonate in septic shock with severe acidemia (pH ≤ 7.2) and AKIN 2–3 AKI, and the BICAR-ICU trial suggested a mortality signal in the AKI subgroup, so a cautious, time-limited trial with close monitoring may be reasonable in that narrow context [^112EiGWp] [^114V1MMK] [^113BU5KQ].

> Let me consider renal replacement therapy next. For metformin-associated lactic acidosis, I should confirm immediate drug cessation and arrange prompt hemodialysis because metformin is dialyzable and dialysis both removes the drug and corrects acidosis. I need to ensure I am not conflating MALA with other lactic acidoses — MALA often has a better prognosis at similar pH than other etiologies, but delay in dialysis worsens outcomes, so early nephrology involvement is warranted [^116q9XRK] [^113dtbBd] [^113AwhYS].

> But wait, what if the lactic acidosis is drug-induced by beta-agonists rather than metformin? In albuterol-induced lactic acidosis, I should reduce the frequency or dose of beta-agonists rather than reflexively escalating sepsis workups, because lactate typically normalizes within 24–72 hours after dose reduction. I should confirm the absence of hypoperfusion and infection before attributing causality to albuterol [^114vTChN] [^112Va9M8].

> For malignancy-associated type B lactic acidosis, I need to ensure early recognition and disease-directed therapy, as cytoreduction and chemotherapy are the cornerstone. Hold on, I should verify that supportive measures alone are insufficient — yes, prognosis remains poor without treating the tumor, so hematology-oncology input and urgent cytoreduction are critical [^117WantC].

> In mitochondrial disease or inborn errors causing lactic acidosis, I should confirm that acute management is supportive with fluids, glucose, and cofactors, and consider specific strategies such as arginine in MELAS. Wait, let me verify the strength of evidence — data are largely observational, but expert guidance supports nitric oxide precursors like arginine for stroke-like episodes, acknowledging low-quality evidence and the need for controlled trials [^113gorUW] [^116oQ9AM] [^111J8bQw].

> I need to ensure I am not overlooking thiamine deficiency as a reversible contributor. In suspected thiamine-responsive states or prior to aggressive glucose loading, administering thiamine is reasonable to avoid worsening lactate accumulation, particularly in malnourished or alcohol use disorder patients [^113kkZht].

> Next, I should review monitoring and reassessment cadence. Lactate should be measured every 2–4 hours initially, with simultaneous ABG to track pH and base deficit, and I should integrate lactate clearance with clinical endpoints such as MAP, urine output, and mental status. If lactate fails to clear or rises despite appropriate therapy, I should double-check for missed sources of hypoxia, ongoing hemorrhage, unrecognized drug toxicity, or new organ failure and escalate accordingly [^1169W9Y1] [^112Ld1ix].

> Let me synthesize a pragmatic algorithm: stabilize and confirm lactic acidosis. Classify type A versus B and identify the cause. Deliver cause-specific therapy (sepsis bundle, metformin withdrawal with dialysis, beta-agonist dose reduction, tumor therapy, thiamine if indicated). Provide supportive care with fluids, vasopressors, and ventilation. Avoid routine bicarbonate except consider a cautious trial in severe acidemia with AKI. And reassess frequently using lactate clearance and clinical response to guide de-escalation or escalation [^114V1MMK] [^112EiGWp].

> Finally, I should confirm key takeaways: lactic acidosis is a marker of severity and a driver of hemodynamic compromise, but outcomes hinge on treating the underlying cause. Routine bicarbonate is not beneficial and may be harmful. Metformin-associated cases require early hemodialysis. Lactate-guided resuscitation and serial lactate clearance improve prognostication and may guide therapy. And I need to keep a broad differential for type B etiologies to avoid anchoring on sepsis alone [^1117qBur] [^116q9XRK] [^115asmtM] [^115G8oLL].

The cornerstone of lactic acidosis management is to **identify and treat the underlying cause** [^113kkZht] (e.g. sepsis, hypoperfusion, toxins, medications) while providing supportive care [^113bMrZm]. Routine sodium bicarbonate is **not recommended** for lactic acidosis with pH ≥ 7.15, as it does not improve hemodynamics or outcomes and may cause harm [^114V1MMK]; reserve bicarbonate for **severe acidemia (pH < 7.1)** with shock or life-threatening arrhythmias, and use with caution [^115qNaVZ] [^113BU5KQ]. For metformin-associated lactic acidosis, **prompt hemodialysis** is indicated to clear metformin and correct acidosis [^116q9XRK] [^116cqQe7]. Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) is reasonable for severe acidosis with AKI or hemodynamic instability [^115LpL1Y]. Monitor lactate, acid–base status, and organ function, and correct hypoglycemia, hypovolemia, and electrolyte disturbances as part of supportive care [^112Ld1ix] [^114iHNUk].

---

## General principles of management

### Identify and treat underlying causes

- **Type A lactic acidosis**: Address tissue hypoxia, hypoperfusion, sepsis, shock, anemia, or respiratory failure [^113kkZht].

- **Type B lactic acidosis**: Identify and stop offending drugs (e.g. metformin, beta-agonists, NRTIs), treat malignancy, liver failure, or mitochondrial disorders [^114vTChN] [^115x5fkm].

- **Medication-induced lactic acidosis**: Discontinue metformin, beta-agonists, or NRTIs; consider specific antidotes or dialysis when indicated [^116cqQe7] [^116q9XRK].

---

### Supportive care

- **Hemodynamic stabilization**: Use fluids and vasopressors to maintain MAP ≥ 65 mmHg and adequate perfusion [^notfound].

- **Oxygenation and ventilation**: Ensure adequate oxygen delivery and correct hypercapnia to reduce respiratory acidosis burden [^116pBiWw].

- **Electrolyte and glucose management**: Correct hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and hypoglycemia to support metabolism and acid–base balance [^112kJ47g].

---

## Role of sodium bicarbonate therapy

### Controversy and guidelines

- **Routine use discouraged**: Sodium bicarbonate is not recommended for lactic acidosis with pH ≥ 7.15, as it does not improve hemodynamics or outcomes and may cause harm [^112EiGWp] [^114V1MMK].

- **Potential harms**: Bicarbonate can increase CO2 load, worsen intracellular acidosis, and cause sodium overload, hypocalcemia, and hyperosmolality [^113bMrZm] [^112kJ47g].

- **Reserved use**: Consider bicarbonate only in severe acidemia (pH < 7.1) with shock, life-threatening arrhythmias, or refractory acidosis, and use with caution [^notfound].

---

### Clinical evidence

Evidence shows **no benefit** — randomized and observational studies show no improvement in hemodynamics, vasopressor requirements, or mortality with bicarbonate in lactic acidosis [^112kJ47g] [^113BU5KQ]. Subgroup considerations suggest a possible benefit in severe acidemia (pH ≤ 7.20) with AKI, but data are limited and evidence is weak [^114V1MMK] [^113BU5KQ].

---

## Renal replacement therapy (RRT)

### Indications

RRT is indicated for **metformin-associated lactic acidosis** to remove metformin and correct acidosis [^116q9XRK] [^116cqQe7]. It is also used for **severe acidosis** with AKI, hemodynamic instability, or refractory cases [^115LpL1Y].

---

### Modalities

Intermittent hemodialysis is **preferred** for metformin clearance and rapid acid–base correction [^115hSEva] [^116cqQe7]. Continuous renal replacement therapy is appropriate for **hemodynamically unstable patients** or when intermittent hemodialysis is unavailable [^116cqQe7].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Track **lactate, pH, bicarbonate, and electrolytes** to guide therapy and detect recurrence [^112Ld1ix]. Assess renal, hepatic, cardiovascular, and respiratory function, and adjust therapy accordingly [^115hSEva]. Educate patients on medication risks, adherence, and early recognition of recurrence [^116q9XRK].

---

## Special considerations

### Pediatric patients

Pediatric patients require **age-appropriate fluid management, electrolyte correction, and RRT dosing** [^117LLM6H]. For pediatric mitochondrial disease, tailor therapy to the underlying disorder and metabolic needs [^116Hw93a].

---

### Chronic lactic acidosis

Chronic lactic acidosis warrants **long-term management** focused on the underlying cause, dietary adjustments, and regular monitoring [^116Hw93a].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Intervention** | **Indication** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|-|
| Sodium bicarbonate | pH ≥ 7.15 | Not recommended |
| Sodium bicarbonate | pH < 7.1 with shock or arrhythmias | Consider with caution |
| Hemodialysis | Metformin-associated lactic acidosis | Strongly recommended |
| CRRT | Severe acidosis with AKI or instability | Recommended |
| Supportive care | All cases | Essential |

---

Effective lactic acidosis management centers on **treating the cause**, supportive care, and selective use of bicarbonate or RRT. Routine bicarbonate is not advised; reserve it for severe acidemia with caution, and use hemodialysis promptly for metformin toxicity.

### Recognizing and managing a metabolic crisis [^1158q6QZ]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

In some relatively common inborn errors of metabolism there can be the accumulation of toxic compounds including ammonia and organic acids such as lactate and ketoacids, as well as energy deficits at the cellular level. The clinical presentation is often referred to as a metabolic emergency or crisis. Fasting and illness can result in encephalopathy within hours, and without appropriate recognition and intervention, the outcome may be permanent disability or death. This review outlines easy and readily available means of recognizing and diagnosing a metabolic emergency as well as general guidelines for management. Disease-specific interventions focus on parenteral nutrition to reverse catabolism, toxin removal strategies, and vitamin/nutrition supplementation.

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of methylmalonic acidaemia and propionic acidaemia: first revision [^111ZxLF8]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2021). Medium credibility.

3.3.1 Initial treatment

Early diagnosis and timely treatment are essential to improve survival and reduce morbidity in MMA and PA patients. Over time survival of these patients has improved. 23, 26, 32, 33, 34, 35 Improved survival seems to be due to improved treatment strategies and patient monitoring. The effect of single treatment variables on survival, however, is not clear from the present evidence. In MMA patients, survival also depends on age of onset and disease subtype; early‐onset MMA patients, in particular mut 0 and cblB patients, have a higher mortality risk. 33, 34

As soon as the diagnosis of MMA and PA is suspected, specific therapies should be initiated and the patient should be referred to a specialist centre as some of the treatments and specialist knowledge are only available there. 35 Intensive care treatment of patients with a metabolic decompensation can be necessary if there is a severe metabolic acidosis with or without hyperammonaemia, and hyperlactataemia. The specifics of these acute treatment modalities, including extracorporeal detoxification, have not been systematically studied yet, and the contribution of individual treatments to the improved survival over the last decades is unclear. The panel has intensively discussed the available evidence and has come up with principles based on expert opinions of how to approach treatment of an (imminent) acute metabolic decompensation in MMA and PA patients (Figure 3). It seems appropriate to advise against the primary use of sodium phenylbutyrate as ammonia scavenger in MMA and PA as it can lead to decreased glutamine levels, potentially hampering tricarboxylic acid cycle anaplerosis via 2‐ketoglutarate. 36 More recently, carglumic acid was trialled as part of hyperammonaemia treatment strategies in MMA and PA. 37, 38, 39 While the medication was so far tolerated with no side effects, 40 further systematic studies are required to prove its efficacy. 41 Further, it has to be noted that extensive administration of glucose intravenously can be associated with lactic acidosis, potentially due to the inhibited pyruvate dehydrogenase enzyme in MMA and PA.

It is not possible to make evidence‐based statements on improvement of survival with liver transplantation, as the published studies focus on the survival shortly after transplantation, but long‐term comparisons to non‐transplanted patients are absent. This applies to liver, kidney and liver‐kidney transplantations, where overall survival after surgery is around 85%. 42, 43, 44

### Bicarbonate therapy in severe metabolic acidosis [^115qNaVZ]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2009). Low credibility.

The utility of bicarbonate administration to patients with severe metabolic acidosis remains controversial. Chronic bicarbonate replacement is obviously indicated for patients who continue to lose bicarbonate in the ambulatory setting, particularly patients with renal tubular acidosis syndromes or diarrhea. In patients with acute lactic acidosis and ketoacidosis, lactate and ketone bodies can be converted back to bicarbonate if the clinical situation improves. For these patients, therapy must be individualized. In general, bicarbonate should be given at an arterial blood pH of ≤ 7.0. The amount given should be what is calculated to bring the pH up to 7.2. The urge to give bicarbonate to a patient with severe acidemia is apt to be all but irresistible. Intervention should be restrained, however, unless the clinical situation clearly suggests benefit. Here we discuss the pros and cons of bicarbonate therapy for patients with severe metabolic acidosis.

Antiretroviral therapy–associated lactic acidosis — prevention and monitoring guidance states that, due to the presence of propylene glycol as a diluent, LPV/r oral solution should not be used in preterm neonates or any neonate who has not attained a postmenstrual age of 42 weeks and a postnatal age of ≥ 14 days, and clinicians should monitor for clinical manifestations of lactic acidosis and promptly adjust therapy. For asymptomatic patients, routine measurement of serum lactate is not recommended.

### Sodium bicarbonate in treating lactic and non-lactic metabolic acidosis at different chloride levels: a retrospective study [^117LLM6H]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Sodium bicarbonate is commonly used to correct metabolic acidosis in pediatric patients, yet its efficacy remains controversial. This study aims to assess its effectiveness in treating non-lactic and lactic metabolic acidosis and its impact at various chloride levels.

Methods

A retrospective cohort study was conducted by screening pediatric patients diagnosed with metabolic acidosis from a paediatric intensive care database. Patients were categorized into two groups: lactate patients (lactate > 2.0 mmol/L) and non-lactate patients (lactate ≤ 2.0 mmol/L). The risk of death in patients who received sodium bicarbonate was assessed.

Results

Sodium bicarbonate treatment did not significantly affect in-hospital mortality in either overall lactate patients or non-lactate patients, with adjusted OR of 1.044 (95% CI: 0.829–1.315, p = 0.714) and 0.838 (95% CI: 0.548–1.281, p = 0.414), respectively. In lactate patients, those receiving sodium bicarbonate had a higher risk of in-hospital death when chloride was < 107 mmol/L (adjusted OR = 2.195, 95% CI: 1.536–3.135, p < 0.001), whereas the risk of in-hospital death decreased when chloride was ≥ 113 mmol/L (adjusted OR = 0.365, 95% CI: 0.217–0.614, p < 0.001). Similar findings were observed in non-lactate patients.

Conclusions

Sodium bicarbonate treatment does not improve the survival of pediatric patients with lactate or non-lactate metabolic acidosis. However, it can reduce the odds of mortality in pediatric patients with hyperchloremia, regardless of their lactate levels. Prospective studies are needed to further confirm these findings.

### Risk of fatal and nonfatal lactic acidosis with metformin use in type 2 diabetes mellitus… [^116X8Egw]. JAMA Network (2003). Excellent credibility.

Interventions studied included metformin, alone or in combination with other treatments, vs placebo or another antihyperglycemic intervention, such as diet, insulin, or sulfonylureas. Data on participants treated with phenformin were not included in the analysis for lactic acidosis but were included in measurements of lactate levels. The treatment effect for fatal and nonfatal lactic acidosis was expressed as a risk difference by taking the incidence of events during metformin, alone or in combination with other treatments, and then subtracting the incidence of events during placebo or alternative treatments. As no cases of lactic acidosis were found, the probable upper limits for the true incidence of lactic acidosis in the metformin and nonmetformin groups were calculated separately using Poisson statistics. Information was obtained on how many patients were older than 65 years or were thought to have concomitant hypoxemic conditions.

Once pooled results revealed no cases of lactic acidosis, it was decided to report on randomized controlled trials that measured blood lactate levels for metformin use compared with placebo or nonbiguanide treatments and also compared with phenformin use. Three outcomes were analyzed for the metformin group compared with the comparison groups: the change in lactate levels from baseline to treatment, the mean lactate levels recorded during treatment, and the change in treatment lactate levels from a basal state to peak stimulation with either food or exercise. Metformin was given in daily doses of 1 to 3 g, with the dosage titrated clinically. Comparison treatments included placebo, diet, insulin, glyburide, gliclazide, glipizide, glibenclamide, glimepiride, chlorpropamide, tolbutamide, acarbose, nateglinide, repaglinide, miglitol, troglitazone, rosiglitazone maleate, and guar gum.

Five trials62, 73, 82, 152, 195 that measured lactate levels did not provide data to be analyzed but reported levels to be normal during metformin and nonmetformin treatment. Metformin treatment in overweight patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus has been shown to reduce cardiovascular and total mortality rates compared with insulin use, sulfonylurea use, or diet alone. 6 Concern about the risk of lactic acidosis has led to recommendations that metformin therapy be withheld in persons with chronic conditions that in themselves can cause lactic acidosis.

### L-lactic acidosis: pathophysiology, classification, and causes; emphasis on biochemical and metabolic basis [^116kvqZe]. Kidney International (2020). Medium credibility.

L-lactic acidosis (L-LA) is the most common cause of metabolic acidosis in the critical care setting, which has been associated with a large increase in mortality. The purpose of this article is to provide clinicians with an overview of the biochemical and metabolic background required to understand the different pathophysiological mechanisms that may lead to the development of L-LA. We propose a classification based on whether the pathophysiology of L-LA is due predominantly to increased production or decreased removal of L-lactic acid. In this article, we provide an overview of the biochemical and metabolic aspects of glucose oxidation, the production and removal of L-lactic acid, and a discussion of the pathophysiology of the various causes of L-LA.

### Lactic acidosis… [^112ojxts]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

ALTHOUGH endogenous lactic acid has been recognized as a source of metabolic acidosis for many years in a variety of situations, 1–5 it was not until the publication by Huckabee of his clinical observations of the significance of lactic acid acidosis 6, 7 that great interest was stimulated in this condition. The demonstration that severe metabolic acidosis, frequently of fatal outcome, was a significant clinical problem has led to the increasing recognition of this situation in clinical practice. 5, 8–17. The definition of lactic acidosis remains arbitrary. Since the production of lactate is always accompanied by an equivalent appearance of hydrogen ion, significant elevation in blood lactate must be interpreted as lactic acidosis regardless of resultant arterial pH or bicarbonate levels.

Qualifying factors include the degree of compensation for the metabolic acidosis, represented by arterial pH, eventual outcome, the presence or absence of clinical symptoms of metabolic acidosis. TRANQUADA RE, GRANT WJ, PETERSON CR. Lactic Acidosis. Arch Intern Med. 1966; 117: 192–202.

### How to interpret lactate [^115fGPHf]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2021). Medium credibility.

The association between hyperlactataemia and poorer outcomes in acutely unwell adults and children is well recognised. Blood lactate testing has become readily available in acute settings and is considered a first-line investigation in international guidelines for the management of sepsis. However, while healthcare professionals do appreciate the value of measuring blood lactate in acute severe illness, its clinical significance and interpretation remain less well understood. In this paper, we present the evidence for the use of lactate as a diagnostic test and prognostic marker in acutely unwell children.

### Metformin hydrochloride er (metformin hydrochloride) [^115TvQuC]. FDA (2014). Low credibility.

WARNINGS

Lactic Acidosis:

Lactic acidosis is a rare, but serious, metabolic complication that can occur due to metformin accumulation during treatment with metformin hydrochloride tablets, USP or metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, USP; when it occurs, it is fatal in approximately 50% of cases. Lactic acidosis may also occur in association with a number of pathophysiologic conditions, including diabetes mellitus, and whenever there is significant tissue hypoperfusion and hypoxemia. Lactic acidosis is characterized by elevated blood lactate levels (> 5 mmol/L), decreased blood pH, electrolyte disturbances with an increased anion gap, and an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio. When metformin is implicated as the cause of lactic acidosis, metformin plasma levels > 5 μg/mL are generally found.

The reported incidence of lactic acidosis in patients receiving metformin hydrochloride is very low (approximately 0.03 cases/1000 patient-years, with approximately 0.015 fatal cases/1000 patient-years). In more than 20,000 patient-years exposure to metformin in clinical trials, there were no reports of lactic acidosis. Reported cases have occurred primarily in diabetic patients with significant renal insufficiency, including both intrinsic renal disease and renal hypoperfusion, often in the setting of multiple concomitant medical/surgical problems and multiple concomitant medications. Patients with congestive heart failure requiring pharmacologic management, in particular those with unstable or acute congestive heart failure who are at risk of hypoperfusion and hypoxemia, are at increased risk of lactic acidosis. The risk of lactic acidosis increases with the degree of renal dysfunction and the patient's age. The risk of lactic acidosis may, therefore, be significantly decreased by regular monitoring of renal function in patients taking metformin hydrochloride tablets, USP or metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, USP and by use of the minimum effective dose of metformin hydrochloride tablets, USP or metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, USP. In particular, treatment of the elderly should be accompanied by careful monitoring of renal function. Metformin hydrochloride tablets, USP or metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, USP treatment should not be initiated in patients ≥ 80 years of age unless measurement of creatinine clearance demonstrates that renal function is not reduced, as these patients are more susceptible to developing lactic acidosis. In addition, metformin hydrochloride tablets, USP and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, USP should be promptly withheld in the presence of any condition associated with hypoxemia, dehydration, or sepsis. Because impaired hepatic function may significantly limit the ability to clear lactate, metformin hydrochloride tablets, USP and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, USP should generally be avoided in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease. Patients should be cautioned against excessive alcohol intake, either acute or chronic, when taking metformin hydrochloride tablets, USP or metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, USP, since alcohol potentiates the effects of metformin hydrochloride on lactate metabolism. In addition, metformin hydrochloride tablets, USP and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, USP should be temporarily discontinued prior to any intravascular radiocontrast study and for any surgical procedure (see also PRECAUTIONS).

### MALAdaptive: do we avoid metformin unnecessarily? [^111NcV1N]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Convention holds that the use of metformin is contraindicated in many patients secondary to concerns about lactic acidosis. However, current evidence suggests that metformin-associated lactic acidosis is at most idiosyncratic. Awareness of the current evidence should permit broader use of this valuable medication.

### Recognising and managing albuterol-induced lactic acidosis [^112kxSmH]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Lactic acidosis is a serious condition often associated with tissue hypoxia or sepsis, but it can also be caused by beta-adrenergic agonists such as albuterol. This report describes a case of albuterol-induced lactic acidosis in a male patient in his 70s with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation. The patient presented with progressively worsening dyspnoea and increased albuterol use. During the initial evaluation, an elevated lactate level was observed, which further increased after albuterol treatment in the emergency room. A thorough sepsis workup was performed, yielding negative results, which ultimately led to the diagnosis of albuterol-induced lactic acidosis. After reducing the frequency of albuterol treatments, the patient's lactate levels normalised. This case underscores the importance of considering medication-induced causes of lactic acidosis, particularly in patients with respiratory conditions who are frequently administered beta-adrenergic agonists. Recognising this under-reported phenomenon can help clinicians avoid unnecessary sepsis workups and ensure more accurate treatment plans.

### Lactic acidosis in sepsis: It's not all anaerobic: implications for diagnosis and management [^114RPu15]. Chest (2016). Low credibility.

Increased blood lactate concentration (hyperlactatemia) and lactic acidosis (hyperlactatemia and serum pH < 7.35) are common in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock and are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. In some patients, most of the lactate that is produced in shock states is due to inadequate oxygen delivery resulting in tissue hypoxia and causing anaerobic glycolysis. However, lactate formation during sepsis is not entirely related to tissue hypoxia or reversible by increasing oxygen delivery. In this review, we initially outline the metabolism of lactate and etiology of lactic acidosis; we then address the pathophysiology of lactic acidosis in sepsis. We discuss the clinical implications of serum lactate measurement in diagnosis, monitoring, and prognostication in acute and intensive care settings. Finally, we explore treatment of lactic acidosis and its impact on clinical outcome.

### Metformin hydrochloride (Glumetza) [^111a5BUv]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

WARNING: LACTIC ACIDOSIS

Postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis have resulted in death, hypothermia, hypotension, and resistant bradyarrhythmias. The onset of metformin-associated lactic acidosis is often subtle, accompanied only by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, respiratory distress, somnolence, and abdominal pain. Metformin-associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate levels (> 5 mmol/Liter), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio, and metformin plasma levels generally > 5 mcg/mL [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis include renal impairment, concomitant use of certain drugs (e.g., carbonic anhydrase inhibitors such as topiramate), age 65 years old or greater, having a radiological study with contrast, surgery and other procedures, hypoxic states (e.g., acute congestive heart failure), excessive alcohol intake, and hepatic impairment.

Steps to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis in these high risk groups are provided in the full prescribing information [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.1), and Drug Interactions (7)].

If metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, immediately discontinue GLUMETZA and institute general supportive measures in a hospital setting. Prompt hemodialysis is recommended [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis have resulted in death, hypothermia, hypotension, and resistant bradyarrhythmias. The onset of metformin- associated lactic acidosis is often subtle, accompanied only by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, respiratory distress, somnolence, and abdominal pain. Metformin- associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate levels (> 5 mmol/Liter), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio; and metformin plasma levels generally > 5 mcg/mL [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis include renal impairment, concomitant use of certain drugs (e.g. carbonic anhydrase inhibitors such as topiramate), age 65 years old or greater, having a radiological study with contrast, surgery and other procedures, hypoxic states (e.g., acute congestive heart failure), excessive alcohol intake, and hepatic impairment.

Steps to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis in these high risk groups are provided [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

If metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, immediately discontinue metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets and institute general supportive measures in a hospital setting. Prompt hemodialysis is recommended [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

### L-arginine in mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes: a systematic review [^111J8bQw]. Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Stroke management in the context of primary mitochondrial disease is clinically challenging, and the best treatment options for patients with stroke-like episodes remain uncertain. We sought to perform a systematic review of the safety and efficacy of l-arginine use in the acute and prophylactic management of stroke-like episodes in patients with mitochondrial disease.

Methods

The systematic review was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42020181230). We searched 6 databases from inception to January 15, 2021: MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, CINAHL, and ClinicalTrials.gov. Original articles and registered trials available, in English, reporting l-arginine use in the acute or prophylactic management of stroke-like episodes in patients with genetically confirmed mitochondrial disease were eligible for inclusion. Data on safety and treatment response were extracted and summarized by multiple observers. Risk of bias was assessed by the methodologic quality of case reports, case series, and a risk-of-bias checklist for nonrandomized studies. Quality of evidence was synthesized with the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine Levels of Evidence and Grade of Recommendations. The predetermined main outcome measures were clinical response to l-arginine treatment, adverse events, withdrawals, and deaths (on treatment and/or during follow-up), as defined by the author.

Results

Thirty-seven articles met inclusion criteria (0 randomized controlled trials; 3 open-label; 1 retrospective cohort; 33 case reports/case series) (N = 91 patients; 86% m.3243A > G). In the case reports, 54% of patients reported a positive clinical response to acute l-arginine, of which 40% were concomitantly treated with antiepileptic drugs. Improved headache at 24 hours was the greatest reported benefit in response to IV l-arginine in the open-label trials (31 of 39, 79%). In 15 of 48 patients (31%) who positively responded to prophylactic l-arginine, antiepileptic drugs were either used (7 of 15) or unreported (8 of 15). Moderate adverse events were reported in the follow-up of both IV and oral l-arginine treatment, and 11 patients (12%) died during follow-up or while on prophylactic treatment.

Discussion

The available evidence is of poor methodologic quality and classified as Level 5. IV and oral l-arginine confers no demonstrable clinical benefit in either the acute or prophylactic treatment of mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes, with more robust controlled trials required to assess its efficacy and safety profile.

### A review of bicarbonate use in common clinical scenarios [^114axg41]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background:

The use of sodium bicarbonate to treat metabolic acidosis is intuitive, yet data suggest that not all patients benefit from this therapy.

Objective:

In this narrative review, we describe the physiology behind commonly encountered nontoxicologic causes of metabolic acidosis, highlight potential harm from the indiscriminate administration of sodium bicarbonate in certain scenarios, and provide evidence-based recommendations to assist emergency physicians in rationale use of sodium bicarbonate.

Discussion:

Sodium bicarbonate can be administered as a hypertonic push, as a resuscitation fluid, or as an infusion. Lactic acidosis and cardiac arrest are two common scenarios where there is limited benefit to routine use of sodium bicarbonate, although certain circumstances, such as patients with concomitant acute kidney injury and lactic acidosis may benefit from sodium bicarbonate. Patients with cardiac arrest secondary to sodium channel blockade or hyperkalemia also benefit from sodium bicarbonate therapy. Recent data suggest that the use of sodium bicarbonate in diabetic ketoacidosis does not confer improved patient outcomes and may cause harm in pediatric patients. Available evidence suggests that alkalinization of urine in rhabdomyolysis does not improve patient-centered outcomes. Finally, patients with a nongap acidosis benefit from sodium bicarbonate supplementation.

Conclusions:

Empiric use of sodium bicarbonate in patients with nontoxicologic causes of metabolic acidosis is not warranted and likely does not improve patient-centered outcomes, except in select scenarios. Emergency physicians should reserve use of this medication to conditions with clear benefit to patients.

Conclusions

Our study suggests that predialysis level of serum lactate level is an important marker of mortality in MALA patients requiring RRT with a linear dose-response relationship. There is no differential survival advantage among RRT modalities and significant knowledge gaps remain regarding the optimal timing, mode, and dose of RRT. Standardization of MALA case report form would be the fundamental step toward guideline development.

5.1 Lactic Acidosis

Metformin

Lactic acidosis is a serious, metabolic complication that can occur due to metformin accumulation during treatment with JENTADUETO and is fatal in approximately 50% of cases. Lactic acidosis may also occur in association with a number of pathophysiologic conditions, including diabetes mellitus, and whenever there is significant tissue hypoperfusion and hypoxemia. Lactic acidosis is characterized by elevated blood lactate levels (> 5 mmol/L), decreased blood pH, electrolyte disturbances with an increased anion gap, and an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio. When metformin is implicated as the cause of lactic acidosis, metformin plasma levels of > 5 µg/mL are generally found.

The reported incidence of lactic acidosis in patients receiving metformin is approximately 0.03 cases/1000 patient-years, (with approximately 0.015 fatal cases/1000 patient-years). In more than 20,000 patient-years exposure to metformin in clinical trials, there were no reports of lactic acidosis. Reported cases have occurred primarily in diabetic patients with significant renal impairment, including both intrinsic renal disease and renal hypoperfusion, often in the setting of multiple concomitant medical/surgical problems and multiple concomitant medications. Patients with congestive heart failure requiring pharmacologic management, particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia due to unstable or acute failure, are at increased risk of lactic acidosis. The risk of lactic acidosis increases with the degree of renal impairment and the patient's age. The risk of lactic acidosis may, therefore, be significantly decreased by regular monitoring of renal function in patients taking metformin. In particular, treatment of the elderly should be accompanied by careful monitoring of renal function. Metformin treatment should not be initiated in any patient unless measurement of creatinine clearance demonstrates that renal function is not reduced. In addition, metformin should be promptly withheld in the presence of any condition associated with hypoxemia, dehydration, or sepsis. Because impaired hepatic function may significantly limit the ability to clear lactate, metformin should be avoided in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic impairment. Patients should be cautioned against excessive alcohol intake when taking metformin, since alcohol potentiates the effects of metformin on lactate metabolism. In addition, metformin should be temporarily discontinued prior to any intravascular radiocontrast study and for any surgical procedure necessitating restricted intake of food or fluids. Use of topiramate, a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, in epilepsy and migraine prophylaxis may cause dose-dependent metabolic acidosis and may exacerbate the risk of metformin-induced lactic acidosis [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Sepsis-associated hyperlactatemia [^112cdM3e]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Why has the tissue hypoxia paradigm emerged and dominated until now?

The clinical syndrome of lactic acidosis was popularized by Huckabee and Weil over five decades ago. These authors proposed that elevated blood lactate levels during experimental and clinical shock states served as a measure of the degree of oxygen deficit and the severity of injury. It became widely believed that, in critically ill patients, when oxygen delivery failed to meet oxygen demand an oxygen debt with global tissue hypoxia and lactic acidosis would ensue. Furthermore, classic teaching describes type A lactic acidosis, which occurs due to inadequate oxygen delivery with the presence of anaerobic glycolysis, and type B lactic acidosis, which occurs in the absence of anaerobic glycolysis and is secondary to altered clearance, malignancy, or drugs. It is widely assumed that type A lactic acidosis is the cause of an elevated lactate concentration in the critically ill patient with an overt or occult hemodynamic disturbance. An increased blood lactate concentration is therefore regarded as evidence of anaerobic metabolism and tissue hypoxia. It follows from this reasoning that patients with an elevated blood lactate level should be treated by increasing oxygen delivery.

### High risk and low prevalence diseases: metformin toxicities [^115Dy7UF]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Metformin toxicity is a rare but serious condition that carries with it a high rate of morbidity and mortality.

Objective

This review highlights the pearls and pitfalls of metformin toxicity, including diagnosis, initial resuscitation, and management in the emergency department (ED) based on current evidence.

Discussion

Metformin is a common medication used for treatment of diabetes mellitus. Metformin toxicity is a spectrum of conditions that may be differentiated into three subgroups: metformin-associated lactic acidosis (MALA), metformin-induced lactic acidosis (MILA), and metformin-unrelated lactic acidosis (MULA). MILA is a condition found predominantly in patients chronically taking metformin or those with large acute overdoses. Conversely, MULA occurs in patients on metformin but with a critical illness stemming from a separate cause. MALA is rare but the most severe form, with mortality rates that reach 50%. Differentiating these entities is difficult in the ED setting without obtaining metformin levels. Patients with metformin toxicity present with nonspecific gastrointestinal symptoms and vital sign abnormalities. Laboratory analysis will reveal a high lactate with anion gap metabolic acidosis. Patients presenting with elevated lactate levels in the setting of metformin use should be considered at risk for the most severe form, MALA. Patients with MALA require aggressive treatment with intravenous fluids, treatment of any concomitant condition, and early consideration of hemodialysis, along with specialist consultation such as nephrology and toxicology.

Conclusions

An understanding of metformin toxicity can assist emergency clinicians in diagnosing and managing this potentially deadly disease.

### Association of metformin use with risk of lactic acidosis… [^117UsEpV]. JAMA Network (2018). Excellent credibility.

Meaning Metformin therapy may be safe in patients with type 2 diabetes and eGFR 30 to 60 mL/min/1. 73 m2. Importance Approximately 1 million patients in the United States with type 2 diabetes mellitus and mild-to-moderate kidney disease do not receive guideline-directed therapy with metformin. This may reflect uncertainty regarding the risk of acidosis in patients with chronic kidney disease. Conclusions and Relevance In 2 real-world clinical settings, metformin use was associated with acidosis only at eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1. 73 m2. Our results support cautious use of metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes and eGFR of at least 30 mL/min/1. 73 m2. m2. 17 Other guidelines cautiously support the use of metformin at eGFR 30 to 60 mL/min/1. 73 m2, recommending that metformin be reviewed18, 19 at eGFR 30 to 45 mL/min/1. 73 m2 and that dose adjustment be considered. 20, 21.

This was true in adjusted, active comparator, and propensity score–matched analyses, and in a replication cohort of 82 017 patients from a nationwide database of health care claims. These findings support the recent expansion of the eGFR thresholds for metformin use by the FDA, and recommendations from other regulatory bodies, which suggest that metformin can be used when eGFR is 45 to 59 mL/min/1. 73 m2 and cautiously when eGFR is 30 to 44 mL/min/1. 73 m2. 18–20. From a public health perspective, the potential benefits of using metformin for patients with DM and CKD are vast, given the increasing number of people affected with both diseases worldwide. 1, 6 Metformin is the first-line therapy for type 2 DM owing to its cost-effectiveness and favorable adverse effect profile. Metformin use was not associated with incident acidosis in patients with eGFR 30 to 60 mL/min/1. 73 m2 in 2 large and diverse cohorts, but there was increased risk at eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1. 73 m2.

Our results support cautious use of metformin in patients with type 2 DM and eGFR of at least 30 mL/min/1. 73 m2.

### Lactic acidosis in a patient with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^113WGksB]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2015). Low credibility.

Lactic acidosis occurs when lactate production exceeds its metabolism. There are many possible causes of lactic acidosis, and in any given patient, several causes may coexist. This Attending Rounds presents a case in point. Metformin's role in the pathogenesis of lactic acidosis in patients with diabetes mellitus is complex, as the present case illustrates. The treatment of lactic acidosis is controversial, except for the imperative to remedy its underlying cause. The use of sodium bicarbonate to treat the often alarming metabolic derangements may be quite efficacious in that regard but is of questionable benefit to patients. Renal replacement therapies (RRTs) have particular appeal in this setting for a variety of reasons, but their effect on clinical outcomes is untested.

Antiretroviral therapy–associated lactic acidosis — clinical features, risk factors, monitoring, and management are outlined as follows: Dyspnea and peripheral neuropathy are listed manifestations, and patients may present with acute multiorgan failure (e.g., fulminant hepatic failure, pancreatic failure, respiratory failure). Risk factors include Preterm Infants or Any Neonates Who Have Not Attained a Postmenstrual Age of 42 Weeks and a Postnatal Age of ≥ 14 Days and exposure to propylene glycol used as a diluent in LPV/r oral solution. For Patients With Clinical Signs or Symptoms Consistent With Lactic Acidosis, obtain blood lactate level and additional diagnostic evaluations should include serum bicarbonate, anion gap, and/or arterial blood gas; amylase and lipase; serum albumin; and hepatic transaminases; blood for lactate determination should be collected and processed within 4 hours of collection. Management includes Anecdotal (Unproven) Supportive Therapies — administer bicarbonate infusions, THAM (tris (hydroxymethyl) aminomethane), high doses of thiamine and riboflavin, and oral antioxidants (e.g. L-carnitine, co-enzyme Q10, vitamin C). Following resolution of abnormalities, resume therapy either with an NRTI-sparing regimen or a revised NRTI-containing regimen, and institute a revised NRTI-containing regimen with caution using NRTIs that are less likely to induce mitochondrial dysfunction (i.e. ABC, TAF, TDF, FTC, or 3TC); lactate should be monitored monthly for ≥ 3 months. Management can be initiated before receiving the results of the confirmatory test.

### Lactic acidosis and associated hypoglycemia… [^1153xwdh]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Lactic acidosis has elicited considerable clinical interest since1961 when Huckabee1, 2 drew attention to it as a clinical entity. Waters et al3 listed the etiologies of excess lactic acid production as follows: no known cause, diabetes mellitus, phenformin hydrochloride, shock, acute anoxia, exercise, extracorporeal circulation, liver glycogen storage disease, and epinephrine injection. Only in the cases of glycogen storage disease4–8 has the association of hyperlactacidemia with hypoglycemia been noted and the necessity of glucose administration been stressed. Among the reported cases of well documented lactic acidosis not associated with glycogen storage disease, four patients had concomitant hypoglycemia9–12 but the authors failed to mention the role of hypoglycemia in those patients. Johnson and Waterhouse11 did, however, point out the need of glucose and insulin in their report of lactic acidosis in a diabetic patient receiving phenfromin.

### Hyperchloremic acidosis in the critically ill: one of the strong-ion acidoses? [^113VDp5q]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2006). Low credibility.

Decreases in plasma bicarbonate are associated with hyperchloremic acidosis and lactic acidosis. According to the Stewart approach to acid-base physiology, the strong-ion difference regulates plasma bicarbonate, with chloride and lactate being the only strong anions routinely measured in clinical chemistry. We hypothesized that the plasma strong-ion difference, both with and without lactate, would have a stronger association with plasma bicarbonate than plasma chloride alone would have with bicarbonate. We used plasma acid-base data from 300 critically ill patients. The correlation with bicarbonate became progressively weaker (P < 0.001): all measured strong ions, r = 0.60; measured strong ions without lactate, r = 0.42; chloride alone, r = -0.27. In a subgroup of 26 patients with traditional hyperchloremic acidosis (base excess < -2 mmol/L and anion gap < 17 mmol/L), the measured strong-ion difference (without lactate) had a stronger correlation (P < 0.001) with bicarbonate than chloride had: r = 0.85 versus r = -0.60. We conclude that hyperchloremic acidosis and lactic acidosis are strong-ion acidoses. Hyperchloremia should be viewed relative to the plasma strong cations. A practical conclusion is that both managing and preventing acid-base disorders with IV fluid therapy involves manipulating each of the plasma strong ions, particularly sodium and chloride.

### The role of lactate clearance in the resuscitation bundle [^1169W9Y1]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

The sepsis resuscitation bundle is the result of an effort on behalf of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign and the Institute for Healthcare Improvement to translate individual guideline recommendations into standardized, achievable goals for physicians caring for the critically ill patient. Implementation of this bundle is associated with decreased mortality. Many of the bundle items reflect components of therapy shown to improve mortality in the seminal early goal-directed therapy trial for severe sepsis and septic shock, including an initial lactate measurement. Elevations in serum lactate are associated with increased mortality, and may result from either increased lactate production or impaired lactate clearance. Lactate clearance may be an important addition to the monitoring and management bundles of patients with severe sepsis and septic shock, However, specific mechanisms of lactate clearance, the relation of lactate clearance to traditional hemodynamic parameters, and the importance of lactate clearance as a therapeutic target or monitoring tool remain unclear.

### A review of bicarbonate use in common clinical scenarios [^1138Kgtw]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Methods

The authors conducted a narrative review of the available literature of bicarbonate therapy in selected topics. The literature search was completed using Google Scholar and PubMed databases for articles written in English published between November 1990 and November 2022. Search terms included: "bicarbonate", "cardiac arrest", "lactate", "lactic acidosis", "diabetic ketoacidosis", "rhabdomyolysis", "acidosis", and "acidemia". Abstracts were reviewed by two authors (S.H. G.W.) for appropriateness and discrepancies were adjudicated by a third author (C.T.). Preference was given to recent randomized trials and meta-analyses. Additional articles were identified if judged relevant in references of selected articles. We reviewed a total of 143 abstracts, of which 27 original research studies and 4 meta-analyses were included.

Levels of Evidence and Strength of Recommendations

The definitions used for grading the level of evidence and the strength of recommendations were adapted from the method used for the American College of Emergency Physicians Clinical Policies and are summarized in Table 1.

### Metformin-associated lactic acidosis [^111BFXkQ]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

A 58-year-old female with known type 2 diabetes mellitus continued to take her usual medications, including metformin, an ACE inhibitor and a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, while suffering from diarrhoea and vomiting. On presentation to the emergency department, she was found to have a profound lactic acidosis, cardiovascular instability and acute kidney injury. Despite a pH of 6.6, lactate of 14mmol/L and a brief asystolic cardiac arrest, supportive treatment and the use of renal replacement therapy resulted in rapid improvement in her acid-base abnormalities and haemodynamic parameters. Metformin-associated lactic acidosis is a rare but life-threatening complication of diabetes management. Patient education and awareness amongst clinicians are paramount in the prevention and treatment of this condition.

### Hemodynamic consequences of severe lactic acidosis in shock states: from bench to bedside [^113bMrZm]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Lactic acidosis is a very common biological issue for shock patients. Experimental data clearly demonstrate that metabolic acidosis, including lactic acidosis, participates in the reduction of cardiac contractility and in the vascular hyporesponsiveness to vasopressors through various mechanisms. However, the contributions of each mechanism responsible for these deleterious effects have not been fully determined and their respective consequences on organ failure are still poorly defined, particularly in humans. Despite some convincing experimental data, no clinical trial has established the level at which pH becomes deleterious for hemodynamics. Consequently, the essential treatment for lactic acidosis in shock patients is to correct the cause. It is unknown, however, whether symptomatic pH correction is beneficial in shock patients. The latest Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines recommend against the use of buffer therapy with pH ≥ 7.15 and issue no recommendation for pH levels < 7.15. Furthermore, based on strong experimental and clinical evidence, sodium bicarbonate infusion alone is not recommended for restoring pH. Indeed, bicarbonate induces carbon dioxide generation and hypocalcemia, both cardiovascular depressant factors. This review addresses the principal hemodynamic consequences of shock-associated lactic acidosis. Despite the lack of formal evidence, this review also highlights the various adapted supportive therapy options that could be putatively added to causal treatment in attempting to reverse the hemodynamic consequences of shock-associated lactic acidosis.

### Expanding the evidence for managing metformin poisoning to support decision-making [^116cqQe7]. Clinical Toxicology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Metformin-associated lactic acidosis is a well-described and commonly encountered condition associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Patients with metformin-associated lactic acidosis are frequently managed in the intensive care unit with supportive care, including volume resuscitation and consideration of an extracorporeal treatment to correct metabolic acidemia and remove metformin and lactate.

Extracorporeal Treatments In Poisoning Workgroup

The Extracorporeal Treatments in Poisoning Workgroup published evidence-based consensus recommendations in 2015 regarding the use of extracorporeal treatment in metformin toxicity. These recommendations list both clinical and biochemical indications, and they outline the rationale and evidence supporting each recommendation.

New Research Since Recommendations Were Published

Subsequent publications have provided new information regarding metformin-associated lactic acidosis and its treatment. A retrospective study showed that patients who did not meet the Extracorporeal Treatments in Poisoning Workgroup criteria for initiation of an extracorporeal treatment had a 100% survival. In patients who met the criteria, survival was approximately 75%; only 66% of these patients received an extracorporeal treatment, and this treatment did not appear to impact survival. Two other retrospective studies in patients diagnosed with metformin-associated lactic acidosis noted that extracorporeal treatments did not improve survival. However, those who received an extracorporeal treatment were more severely ill, potentially supporting a benefit from this intervention. A systematic review of patients receiving continuous kidney replacement therapy identified an overall survival that was higher than the overall survival in patients included in the Workgroup publication. This led the authors to suggest that intermittent hemodialysis may not be the preferred treatment for metformin toxicity. However, a closer look at the Workgroup data identified improved survival with each decade since the initial reports in the 1970s. Furthermore, there are multiple reports of persistent metformin-associated lactic acidosis that did not improve with standard continuous kidney replacement therapy, prompting an increase in the dosage of the extracorporeal treatment. The data supporting these observations are largely derived from retrospective studies, which have inherent biases, so prospective studies are required.

Prescribing Extracorporeal Treatments For Patients With Metformin Poisoning

Case-based decision-making is always necessary, but in general, we continue to follow the Extracorporeal Treatments in Poisoning Workgroup criteria because a convincing reason for changing these has not yet been presented. This includes the use of intermittent hemodialysis where possible, particularly in cases of severe poisoning. For patients with less severe poisoning or when intermittent hemodialysis is not readily available, it is reasonable to trial continuous modalities with careful observation for deterioration.

### Glyburide and metformin [^112JrXzC]. FDA (2011). Low credibility.

Lactic Acidosis

Lactic acidosis is a rare, but serious, metabolic complication that can occur due to metformin accumulation during treatment with glyburide and metformin; when it occurs, it is fatal in approximately 50% of cases. Lactic acidosis may also occur in association with a number of pathophysiologic conditions, including diabetes mellitus, and whenever there is significant tissue hypoperfusion and hypoxemia. Lactic acidosis is characterized by elevated blood lactate levels (> 5 mmol/L), decreased blood pH, electrolyte disturbances with an increased anion gap, and an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio. When metformin is implicated as the cause of lactic acidosis, metformin plasma levels > 5 mcg/mL are generally found.

The reported incidence of lactic acidosis in patients receiving metformin hydrochloride is very low (approximately 0.03 cases/1000 patient-years, with approximately 0.015 fatal cases/1000 patient-years). In more than 20,000 patient-years exposure to metformin in clinical trials, there were no reports of lactic acidosis. Reported cases have occurred primarily in diabetic patients with significant renal insufficiency, including both intrinsic renal disease and renal hypoperfusion, often in the setting of multiple concomitant medical/surgical problems and multiple concomitant medications. Patients with congestive heart failure requiring pharmacologic management, in particular those with unstable or acute congestive heart failure who are at risk of hypoperfusion and hypoxemia, are at increased risk of lactic acidosis. The risk of lactic acidosis increases with the degree of renal dysfunction and the patient's age. The risk of lactic acidosis may, therefore, be significantly decreased by regular monitoring of renal function in patients taking metformin and by use of the minimum effective dose of metformin. In particular, treatment of the elderly should be accompanied by careful monitoring of renal function. Glyburide and metformin treatment should not be initiated in patients ≥ 80 years of age unless measurement of creatinine clearance demonstrates that renal function is not reduced, as these patients are more susceptible to developing lactic acidosis. In addition, glyburide and metformin should be promptly withheld in the presence of any condition associated with hypoxemia, dehydration, or sepsis. Because impaired hepatic function may significantly limit the ability to clear lactate, glyburide and metformin should generally be avoided in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease. Patients should be cautioned against excessive alcohol intake, either acute or chronic, when taking glyburide and metformin, since alcohol potentiates the effects of metformin hydrochloride on lactate metabolism. In addition, glyburide and metformin hydrochloride should be temporarily discontinued prior to any intravascular radiocontrast study and for any surgical procedure (see also PRECAUTIONS).

### Lactic acidosis update for critical care clinicians [^113kkZht]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2001). Low credibility.

Lactic acidosis is a broad-anion gap metabolic acidosis caused by lactic acid overproduction or underutilization. The quantitative dimensions of these two mechanisms commonly differ by 1 order of magnitude. Overproduction of lactic acid, also termed type A lactic acidosis, occurs when the body must regenerate ATP without oxygen (tissue hypoxia). Circulatory, pulmonary, or hemoglobin transfer disorders are commonly responsible. Overproduction of lactate also occurs with cyanide poisoning or certain malignancies. Underutilization involves removal of lactic acid by oxidation or conversion to glucose. Liver disease, inhibition of gluconeogenesis, pyruvate dehydrogenase (thiamine) deficiency, and uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation are the most common causes. The kidneys also contribute to lactate removal. Concerns have been raised regarding the role of metformin in the production of lactic acidosis, on the basis of individual case reports. The risk appears to be considerably less than with phenformin and involves patients with underlying severe renal and cardiac dysfunction. Drugs used to treat lactic acidosis can aggravate the condition. NaHCO(3) increases lactate production. Treatment of type A lactic acidosis is particularly unsatisfactory. NaHCO(3) is of little value. Carbicarb is a mixture of Na(2)CO(3) and NaHCO(3) that buffers similarly to NaHCO(3) but without net generation of CO(2). The results from animal studies are promising; however, clinical trials are sparse. Dichloroacetate stimulates pyruvate dehydrogenase and improves laboratory values, but unfortunately not survival rates, among patients with lactic acidosis. Hemofiltration has been advocated for the treatment of lactic acidosis, on the basis of anecdotal experiences. However, kinetic studies of lactate removal do not suggest that removal can counteract lactate production in any meaningful way. The ideal treatment is to stop acid production by treating the underlying disorder.

### Sodium bicarbonate in treating lactic and non-lactic metabolic acidosis at different chloride levels: a retrospective study [^113akvqQ]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In summary, this study observed that sodium bicarbonate treatment did not improve the survival of pediatric patients with lactic or non-lactic metabolic acidosis. However, regardless of lactate levels, it reduced the odds of mortality in patients with hyperchloremia, while increased the odds of mortality in non-hyperchloremic patients. Prospective studies are needed to confirm the causal benefit of bicarbonate in hyperchloremic acidosis.

Lactic Acidosis

There have been postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis, including fatal cases. These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence; however, hypothermia, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis. Metformin-associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (greater than 5 mmol/L), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), and an increased lactate:pyruvate ratio; metformin plasma levels generally greater than 5 mcg/mL. Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate increasing lactate blood levels which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients at risk.

If metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, general supportive measures should be instituted promptly in a hospital setting, along with immediate discontinuation of KAZANO. In KAZANO-treated patients with a diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis, prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin (metformin HCl is dialyzable, with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions). Hemodialysis has often resulted in reversal of symptoms and recovery.

Educate patients and their families about the symptoms of lactic acidosis and if these symptoms occur instruct them to discontinue KAZANO and report these symptoms to their healthcare provider.

### Recognising and managing albuterol-induced lactic acidosis [^114Ysm3h]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

Lactic acidosis is defined as a plasma lactate concentration greater than 4 mmol/L, and hyperlactataemia if plasma lactate concentration is greater than 2 mmol/L. Lactic acidosis is a metabolic condition that can occur due to multiple causes, including tissue hypoxia, toxins and certain medications. The elevated lactic acid level is either by increased production or by decreased utilisation/clearance from the body or deranged cellular metabolism.

Beta-adrenergic agonists, such as albuterol, are commonly used in the treatment of asthma and COPD exacerbations due to their ability to relax bronchial smooth muscles. The exact mechanism by which beta-adrenergic agonists induce lactic acidosis remains unclear. However, their stimulation of beta-2 adrenergic receptors also triggers systemic metabolic effects. Stimulation of these receptors increases intracellular cyclic AMP which subsequently activates the enzymes responsible for glycolysis and lipolysis, leading to increased production of pyruvate and free fatty acids. The excess pyruvate is shunted into the anaerobic glycolysis pathway, leading to the increased production of lactate. Additionally, it has been suggested that beta-adrenergic stimulation can reduce lactate clearance by inhibiting pyruvate dehydrogenase, which is responsible for converting pyruvate into acetyl-CoA for entry into the citric acid cycle.

### Metformin-associated lactic acidosis (MALA): moving towards a new paradigm [^1152sZf6]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2017). Low credibility.

Although metformin has been used for over 60years, the balance between the drug's beneficial and adverse effects is still subject to debate. Following an analysis of how cases of so-called "metformin-associated lactic acidosis" (MALA) are reported in the literature, the present article reviews the pitfalls to be avoided when assessing the purported association between metformin and lactic acidosis. By starting from pathophysiological considerations, we propose a new paradigm for lactic acidosis in metformin-treated patients. Metformin therapy does not necessarily induce metformin accumulation, just as metformin accumulation does not necessarily induce hyperlactatemia, and hyperlactatemia does not necessarily induce lactic acidosis. In contrast to the conventional view, MALA probably accounts for a smaller proportion of cases than either metformin-unrelated lactic acidosis or metformin-induced lactic acidosis. Lastly, this review highlights the need for substantial improvements in the reporting of cases of lactic acidosis in metformin-treated patients. Accordingly, we propose a check-list as a guide to clinical practice.

### Recognising and managing albuterol-induced lactic acidosis [^117KjtkU]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

In cases of suspected albuterol-induced lactic acidosis, the primary management involves reducing the frequency of beta-adrenergic agonist administration. In most cases, lactate levels normalise within 24 to 72 hours after adjusting the albuterol dose or frequency. Supportive care, including intravenous fluids and monitoring of metabolic parameters, is typically sufficient to manage these patients. Discontinuation of beta-adrenergic agonists is rarely necessary, as reducing the frequency of administration is usually effective in resolving acidosis.

We considered metformin-associated lactic acidosis as a differential diagnosis in our case. However, since our patient was not on metformin or any biguanide medications, this aetiology was effectively ruled out. Metformin-associated lactic acidosis is an extremely rare event, with an estimated incidence of 0.03 to 0.06 per 1000 patient-years. Evidence suggests that metformin alone rarely causes lactic acidosis and, when it does, it is typically in the presence of underlying risk factors such as renal impairment, sepsis or tissue hypoxia. A systematic review from the Cochrane Library, analysing 347 comparative trials and cohort studies, found no cases of fatal or non-fatal lactic acidosis and no significant difference in plasma lactate levels between metformin-treated and non-metformin-treated groups.

The case presented here illustrates the importance of recognising albuterol as a potential cause of lactic acidosis. The patient, who was treated with frequent albuterol nebulisations for a COPD exacerbation, developed significant lactic acidosis in the absence of tissue hypoxia. After ruling out sepsis and other causes of lactic acidosis, we reduced the frequency of albuterol treatments, leading to the normalisation of the patient's lactate levels. Clinicians should be aware of this potential side effect of beta-adrenergic agonists, particularly in patients who develop hyperlactataemia without signs of tissue hypoxia or infection.

In clinical practice, elevated lactate levels often trigger concerns for sepsis, prompting extensive investigations. This case emphasises the need for clinicians to consider albuterol-induced lactic acidosis as a differential diagnosis in patients receiving high doses of beta-adrenergic agonists, especially when other causes of lactic acidosis have been ruled out. Recognising this condition can prevent unnecessary investigations for sepsis and treatments, such as empirical antibiotics or aggressive fluid resuscitation, which may not be warranted.

### Treatment of lactic acidosis: appropriate confusion [^112hz3TN]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Lactic acidosis (LA) is common in hospitalized patients and is associated with poor clinical outcomes. There have been major recent advances in our understanding of lactate generation and physiology. However, treatment of LA is an area of controversy and uncertainty, and the use of agents to raise pH is not clearly beneficial.

Aim and Methods

We reviewed animal and human studies on the pathogenesis, impact, and treatment of LA, published in the English language and available through the PubMed/MEDLINE database. Our aim was to clarify the physiology of the generation of LA, its impact on outcomes, and the different treatment modalities available. We also examined relevant data regarding LA induced by medications commonly prescribed by hospitalists: biguanides, nucleoside analog reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), linezolid, and lorazepam.

Results/Conclusions

Lactic acid is a marker of tissue ischemia but it also may accumulate without tissue hypoperfusion. In the latter circumstance, lactic acid accumulation may be an adaptive mechanism-a novel possibility quite in contrast to the traditional view of lactic acid as only a marker of tissue ischemia. Studies on the treatment of LA with sodium bicarbonate or other buffers fail to show consistent clinical benefit. Severe acidemia in the setting of LA is a particularly poorly studied area. In the settings of medication-induced LA, optimal treatment, apart from prompt cessation of the offending agent, is still unclear.

### Treatment options for lactic acidosis and metabolic crisis in children with mitochondrial disease [^116Hw93a]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2015). Low credibility.

The mitochondrial pyruvate oxidation route is a tightly regulated process, which is essential for aerobic cellular energy production. Disruption of this pathway may lead to severe neurometabolic disorders with onset in early childhood. A frequent finding in these patients is acute and chronic lactic acidemia, which is caused by increased conversion of pyruvate via the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase. Under stable clinical conditions, this process may remain well compensated and does not require specific therapy. However, especially in situations with altered energy demands, such as febrile infections or longer periods of fasting, children with mitochondrial disorders have a high risk of metabolic decompensation with exacerbation of hyperlactatemia and severe metabolic acidosis. Unfortunately, no controlled studies regarding therapy of this critical condition are available and clinical outcome is often unfavorable. Therefore, the aim of this review was to formulate expert-based suggestions for treatment of these patients, including dietary recommendations, buffering strategies and specific drug therapy. However, it is important to keep in mind that a specific therapy for the underlying metabolic cause in children with mitochondrial diseases is usually not available and symptomatic therapy especially of severe lactic acidosis has its ethical limitations.

### Metformin-associated lactic acidosis: moving towards a new paradigm? [^111pzGg5]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2017). Low credibility.

Recent publications 7, 8 have advocated broadening the use of metformin in patients with more advanced CKD, including patients on dialysis and/or awaiting renal transplant. Treatment options for these patients are limited, and metformin has generally not been widely used for the reasons stated earlier. Although these publications acknowledge the need for controlled clinical trial data, which is currently lacking, they propose that patients with advanced renal disease could be treated with lower doses of metformin to improve glycaemic control without excessive plasma accumulation. Dose reduction in renally impaired patients is a common strategy for renally cleared drugs that act systemically, and while such a strategy would probably result in acceptable exposure in the context of safety, the relationship between metformin plasma exposure and efficacy is not that simple. There is increasing evidence that a substantial contribution to the glycaemic effect of metformin is mediated through the intestine rather than primarily through systemic exposure. 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 Given that the bioavailability of metformin increases with decreasing dose, 14 it is unlikely that the low doses of metformin required to maintain acceptable plasma concentrations would deliver sufficient metformin to the intestine to leverage the gut‐based mechanisms of action. 15

In summary, classification of LA in metformin‐treated patients should acknowledge the complexity of the contributing factors and weigh the potential roles of both metformin accumulation and underlying hypoxic diseases/conditions based on all the information available. This is particularly important in patients at inherently higher risk of MALA, such as the elderly and those with advanced CKD.

### Should dialysis be offered in all cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis? [^114GuTf7]. Critical Care (2009). Low credibility.

Metformin is commonly used in diabetes mellitus type 2, with lactic acidosis being a rare but potentially fatal complication of this therapy. The management of metformin-associated lactic acidosis (MALA) is controversial. Treatment may include supportive care, activated charcoal, bicarbonate infusion, hemodialysis, or continuous venovenous hemofiltration. In the previous issue of Critical Care, Peters and colleagues systematically evaluated outcomes in MALA patients admitted to their intensive care unit. The mortality rate of patients who received dialysis was similar to that of patients who were not dialyzed. However, it was the more acutely and chronically ill patients who actually received dialysis. This suggests that hemodialysis was beneficial in preventing a higher mortality rate in those who required renal replacement therapy.

The correct identification of the cause, and ideally the individual acid, responsible for metabolic acidosis in the critically ill ensures rational management. In Part 2 of this review, we examine the elevated (corrected) anion gap acidoses (lactic, ketones, uraemic and toxin ingestion) and contrast them with nonelevated conditions (bicarbonate wasting, renal tubular acidoses and iatrogenic hyperchloraemia) using readily available base excess and anion gap techniques. The potentially erroneous interpretation of elevated lactate signifying cell ischaemia is highlighted. We provide diagnostic and therapeutic guidance when faced with a high anion gap acidosis, for example pyroglutamate, in the common clinical scenario 'I can't identify the acid — but I know it's there'. The evidence that metabolic acidosis affects outcomes and thus warrants correction is considered and we provide management guidance including extracorporeal removal and fomepizole therapy.

### Metabolic acidosis: pathophysiology, diagnosis and management [^1117qBur]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2010). Medium credibility.

Metabolic acidosis is characterized by a primary reduction in serum bicarbonate (HCO(3)(-)) concentration, a secondary decrease in the arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO(2)) of approximately 1 mmHg for every 1 mmol/l fall in serum HCO(3)(-) concentration, and a reduction in blood pH. Acute forms (lasting minutes to several days) and chronic forms (lasting weeks to years) of the disorder can occur, for which the underlying cause/s and resulting adverse effects may differ. Acute forms of metabolic acidosis most frequently result from the overproduction of organic acids such as ketoacids or lactic acid; by contrast, chronic metabolic acidosis often reflects bicarbonate wasting and/or impaired renal acidification. The calculation of the serum anion gap, calculated as [Na(+)] - ([HCO(3)(-)] + [Cl(-)]), aids diagnosis by classifying the disorders into categories of normal (hyperchloremic) anion gap or elevated anion gap. These categories can overlap, however. Adverse effects of acute metabolic acidosis primarily include decreased cardiac output, arterial dilatation with hypotension, altered oxygen delivery, decreased ATP production, predisposition to arrhythmias, and impairment of the immune response. The main adverse effects of chronic metabolic acidosis are increased muscle degradation and abnormal bone metabolism. Using base to treat acute metabolic acidosis is controversial because of a lack of definitive benefit and because of potential complications. By contrast, the administration of base for the treatment of chronic metabolic acidosis is associated with improved cellular function and few complications.

Importance Strokelike episodes are a cardinal feature of several mitochondrial syndromes, including mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and strokelike episodes. Recent advances in the understanding of the pathophysiologic mechanisms of strokelike episodes in MELAS have led to improved treatment options. Observations Current understanding of the cause of strokelike episodes in MELAS and present recommendations to assist in the identification and treatment of patients with MELAS who present with stroke are presented. Mounting evidence points toward a benefit of the nitric oxide precursors, arginine, to both prevent and reduce the severity of strokes in patients with MELAS. Conclusions and Relevance Although much information is still needed regarding the appropriate dosing and timing of arginine therapy in patients with MELAS, urgent administration of nitric oxide precursors in patients with MELAS ameliorates the clinical symptoms associated with strokelike episodes.

### Glyburide and metformin hydrochloride (Glucovance) [^115uNUf8]. FDA (2012). Low credibility.

Lactic acidosis:

Lactic
acidosis is a rare, but serious, metabolic complication that can occur due
to metformin accumulation during treatment with GLUCOVANCE (Glyburide and
Metformin HCl) Tablets; when it occurs, it is fatal in approximately 50% of
cases. Lactic acidosis may also occur in association with a number of pathophysiologic
conditions, including diabetes mellitus, and whenever there is significant
tissue hypoperfusion and hypoxemia. Lactic acidosis is characterized by elevated
blood lactate levels (> 5 mmol/L), decreased blood pH, electrolyte disturbances
with an increased anion gap, and an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio. When
metformin is implicated as the cause of lactic acidosis, metformin plasma
levels > 5 µg/mL are generally found.

The
reported incidence of lactic acidosis in patients receiving metformin hydrochloride
is very low (approximately 0.03 cases/1000 patient-years, with approximately
0.015 fatal cases/1000 patient-years). In more than 20,000 patient-years exposure
to metformin in clinical trials, there were no reports of lactic acidosis.
Reported cases have occurred primarily in diabetic patients with significant
renal insufficiency, including both intrinsic renal disease and renal hypoperfusion,
often in the setting of multiple concomitant medical/surgical problems and
multiple concomitant medications. Patients with congestive heart failure requiring
pharmacologic management, in particular those with unstable or acute congestive
heart failure who are at risk of hypoperfusion and hypoxemia, are at increased
risk of lactic acidosis. The risk of lactic acidosis increases with the degree
of renal dysfunction and the patient's age. The risk of lactic acidosis may,
therefore, be significantly decreased by regular monitoring of renal function
in patients taking metformin and by use of the minimum effective dose of metformin.
In particular, treatment of the elderly should be accompanied by careful monitoring
of renal function. GLUCOVANCE treatment should not be initiated in patients
≥ 80 years of age unless measurement of creatinine clearance demonstrates that
renal function is not reduced, as these patients are more susceptible to developing
lactic acidosis. In addition, GLUCOVANCE should be promptly withheld in the
presence of any condition associated with hypoxemia, dehydration, or sepsis.
Because impaired hepatic function may significantly limit the ability to clear
lactate, GLUCOVANCE should generally be avoided in patients with clinical
or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease. Patients should be cautioned against
excessive alcohol intake, either acute or chronic, when taking GLUCOVANCE,
since alcohol potentiates the effects of metformin hydrochloride on lactate
metabolism. In addition, GLUCOVANCE should be temporarily discontinued prior
to any intravascular radiocontrast study and for any surgical procedure (see
also PRECAUTIONS).

5.1 Lactic Acidosis

There have been postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis, including fatal cases. These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence; however, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis. Metformin‑associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (> 5 mmol/L), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), and an increased lactate: pyruvate ratio; metformin plasma levels were generally > 5 mcg/mL. Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate increasing lactate blood levels which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients at risk.
If metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, general supportive measures should be instituted promptly in a hospital setting, along with immediate discontinuation of RIOMET. In RIOMET treated patients with a diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis, prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin (metformin hydrochloride is dialyzable with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions).

Educate patients and their families about the symptoms of lactic acidosis and, if these symptoms occur, instruct them to discontinue RIOMET and report these symptoms to their healthcare provider.
For each of the known and possible risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis, recommendations to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis are provided below:
Before initiating RIOMET, obtain an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).
RIOMET is contraindicated in patients with an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2[see Contraindications (4)].
Initiation of RIOMET is not recommended in patients with eGFR between 30 to 45 mL/min/1.73 m2.
Obtain an eGFR at least annually in all patients taking RIOMET. In patients at risk for the development of renal impairment (e.g., the elderly), renal function should be assessed more frequently.
In patients taking RIOMET whose eGFR falls below 45 mL/min/1.73 m2, assess the benefit and risk of continuing therapy.
Renal impairment — The postmarketing metformin-associated lactic acidosis cases primarily occurred in patients with significant renal impairment.
The risk of metformin accumulation and metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the severity of renal impairment because metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney. Clinical recommendations based upon the patient's renal function include [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]:
Before initiating RIOMET, obtain an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).
RIOMET is contraindicated in patients with an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2[see Contraindications (4)].
Initiation of RIOMET is not recommended in patients with eGFR between 30 to 45 mL/min/1.73 m2.
Obtain an eGFR at least annually in all patients taking RIOMET. In patients at risk for the development of renal impairment (e.g., the elderly), renal function should be assessed more frequently.
In patients taking RIOMET whose eGFR falls below 45 mL/min/1.73 m2, assess the benefit and risk of continuing therapy.
Drug interactions — The concomitant use of RIOMET with specific drugs may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis: those that impair renal function, result in significant hemodynamic change, interfere with acid-base balance, or increase metformin accumulation. Consider more frequent monitoring of patients [see Drug Interactions (7)].
Age 65 or greater — The risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the patient's age because elderly patients have a greater likelihood of having hepatic, renal, or cardiac impairment than younger patients. Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients.
Radiologic studies with contrast — Administration of intravascular iodinated contrast agents in metformin-treated patients has led to an acute decrease in renal function and the occurrence of lactic acidosis. Stop RIOMET at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m2; in patients with a history of hepatic impairment, alcoholism or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging procedure, and restart RIOMET if renal function is stable.
Surgery and other procedures — Withholding of food and fluids during surgical or other procedures may increase the risk for volume depletion, hypotension, and renal impairment. RIOMET should be temporarily discontinued while patients have restricted food and fluid intake.
Hypoxic states — Several of the postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart failure (particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia). Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may cause prerenal azotemia. When such an event occurs, discontinue RIOMET.
Excessive alcohol intake — Alcohol potentiates the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism. Patients should be warned against excessive alcohol intake while receiving RIOMET.
Hepatic impairment — Patients with hepatic impairment have developed cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. This may be due to impaired lactate clearance resulting in higher lactate blood levels. Therefore, avoid use of RIOMET in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease.

The risk of lactic acidosis increases with the degree of renal dysfunction and the patient's age. The risk of lactic acidosis may, therefore, be significantly decreased by regular monitoring of renal function in patients taking metformin. In particular, treatment of the elderly should be accompanied by careful monitoring of renal function. Pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride treatment should not be initiated in any patient unless measurement of creatinine clearance demonstrates that renal function is not reduced. In addition, metformin should be promptly withheld in the presence of any condition associated with hypoxemia, dehydration, or sepsis. Because impaired hepatic function may significantly limit the ability to clear lactate, metformin should generally be avoided in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic impairment. Patients should be cautioned against excessive alcohol intake when taking metformin, because alcohol potentiates the effects of metformin on lactate metabolism. In addition, metformin should be temporarily discontinued prior to any intravascular radiocontrast study and for any surgical procedure necessitating restricted intake of food or fluids [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.10, 5.11, 5.12, 5.13)]. Use of topiramate, a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, in epilepsy and migraine prophylaxis may frequently cause dose-dependent metabolic acidosis and may exacerbate the risk of metformin-induced lactic acidosis [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.1) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)].

### Association between the acidemia, lactic acidosis, and shock severity with outcomes in patients with cardiogenic shock [^116pBiWw]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Hypoperfusion and Hemometabolic Shock

While the severity of lactic acidosis is clearly an important prognostic marker in CS, it remains uncertain how to use this information to tailor therapy. Impaired lactate clearance (defined as a persistently elevated or rising lactate over time) may be an even more powerful prognostic marker than an elevated admission lactate level alone. Indeed, both MCR and UHZ incorporated a rising lactate level into our definitions of SCAI shock stage D, and patients in SCAI shock stage D had substantially higher mortality than patients with lower CS severity. For this reason, worsening lactic acidosis in patients with CS should trigger an escalation of therapy to alleviate ongoing hypoperfusion. Severe systemic acidemia is known to compromise the cardiovascular response to catecholamines and therefore may directly contribute to worsening or refractory shock; this explains the high prevalence of low blood pH among patients in SCAI shock stage E.

Hypoperfusion causes systemic acidemia directly via lactic acidosis and often causes kidney injury that further compromises acid‐base homeostasis and buffering of the metabolic acid load; in addition, respiratory failure is common and can further impair compensation. These metabolic derangements contribute to a worsening shock state termed hemometabolic shock. Breaking this shock‐acidosis‐shock vicious cycle using alkali therapy (such as sodium bicarbonate) to reverse systemic acidemia seems logical, but this approach remains controversial and has not been clearly demonstrated to improve outcomes in critically ill patients. Greater benefits of alkali may be observed in patients with acute kidney injury, and we anticipate that patients with CS with lower blood pH might more likely to benefit. Alternatively, adjustments in mechanical ventilator settings to improve alveolar ventilation and clear carbon dioxide may be necessary. For this reason, routine measurement of arterial pH (ideally a full arterial blood gas analysis) in addition to the lactate level is appropriate for initial risk stratification and management of patients with CS. A therapeutic trial of alkali therapy can be considered for patients with CS with severe systemic acidemia from metabolic acidosis if they are not responding appropriately to standard doses of vasopressors, but future studies are need to determine the benefit of this approach.

5.1 Lactic Acidosis

There have been postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis, including fatal cases. These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence; however, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis. Metformin-associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (> 5 mmol/L), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), and an increased lactate: pyruvate ratio; metformin plasma levels were generally > 5 mcg/mL. Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate increasing lactate blood levels which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients at risk.

If metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, general supportive measures should be instituted promptly in a hospital setting, along with immediate discontinuation of glyburide and metformin hydrochloride. In glyburide and metformin hydrochloride treated patients with a diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis, prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin (metformin HCl is dialyzable with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions). Hemodialysis has often resulted in reversal of symptoms and recovery.

Educate patients and their families about the symptoms of lactic acidosis and, if these symptoms occur, instruct them to discontinue glyburide and metformin hydrochloride and report these symptoms to their healthcare provider.

### A review of bicarbonate use in common clinical scenarios [^113BU5KQ]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Acidemia has been implicated in contributing to cardiovascular instability and decreased responsiveness to catecholamines and severe lactic acidosis is associated with increased mortality. This has led to the general belief and clinical practice that severe acidemia (usu- ally defined as a pH ≤ 7.10 to 7.20), should be corrected in the setting of lactic acidosis while awaiting definitive treatment of or response to treatment for the underlying cause. When surveyed, 86% of nephrologists and 67% of intensivists would initiate buffer treatment for patients with lactic acidosis, and 87% of nephrologists and 75% of intensivists would target a pH ≥ 7.2.

Despite widespread use, it is unknown whether treating extracellular acidosis with sodium bicarbonate affects clinical outcomes. Prior data have indicated that sodium bicarbonate administration does not improve hemodynamics in critically ill patients with lactic acidosis. Interestingly, there is no effect seen even in patients with severe acidemia (pH 6.90–7.20) and concurrent vasopressor use. Various studies, including the recent analysis of the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III database, have found that sodium bicarbonate does not improve mortality in critically ill patients with severe acidemia (pH < 7.20) or in septic patients with metabolic acidosis, except in patients with concomitant acute kidney injury. Importantly, most publications evaluating the effect of supplemental bicarbonate therapy in patients with lactic acidosis have been observational or retrospective. The BICAR-ICU (Sodium Bicarbonate Therapy for Patients with Severe Metabolic Acidaemia in the Intensive Care Unit) trial is the only randomized trial published that randomized 394 adult patients with pH < 7.2, bicarbonate < 21 mmol/L, and arterial serum lactate 2 > mmol/L to receive supplemental bicarbonate therapy. The trial used a 4.2% sodium bicarbonate infusion to target a pH > 7.3 in critically ill patients admitted to the ICU — and did not include patients in the emergency department or those who had received a bicarbonate infusion in the 24 h prior to enrollment. The authors found no difference in 28-day mortality or presence of single-organ failure at day 7 (primary composite outcome) in patients randomized to receive bicarbonate infusion vs. the control group. However, the authors completed a prespecified subgroup analysis in which they found that patients with acute kidney injury and pH < 7.2 did have a decrease in mortality at 28 days (63% vs. 46%; p = 0.017). The au- thors also found that renal replacement therapy need was decreased in those randomized to receive the bicarbon- ate infusion. Notable adverse events in the bicarbonate group included higher rates of hypernatremia, hypocalcemia, and metabolic alkalosis.

### Recommendations for the management of strokelike episodes in patients with mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and strokelike episodes [^113gorUW]. JAMA Neurology (2016). Medium credibility.

Importance

Strokelike episodes are a cardinal feature of several mitochondrial syndromes, including mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and strokelike episodes (MELAS). Recent advances in the understanding of the pathophysiologic mechanisms of strokelike episodes in MELAS have led to improved treatment options.

Observations

Current understanding of the cause of strokelike episodes in MELAS and present recommendations to assist in the identification and treatment of patients with MELAS who present with stroke are presented. Mounting evidence points toward a benefit of the nitric oxide precursors, arginine, to both prevent and reduce the severity of strokes in patients with MELAS.

Conclusions and Relevance

Although much information is still needed regarding the appropriate dosing and timing of arginine therapy in patients with MELAS, urgent administration of nitric oxide precursors in patients with MELAS ameliorates the clinical symptoms associated with strokelike episodes.

### Lactate versus non-lactate metabolic acidosis: a retrospective outcome evaluation of critically ill patients [^1151jCXe]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

This study has several limitations. First, as a retrospective study, our database is limited to the variables that were collected for clinical management, and some patients with metabolic acidosis may have been excluded because of missing data. However, these were the data available to clinicians and our study demonstrates that a significant number of patients suspected of having lactic acidosis clinically do in fact have other forms of metabolic acidosis. Second, we could not control for severity of illness between groups. Severity of illness scores (for example Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE)) were recorded only on admission to ICU and only in a subset of patients. Several patients had their highest lactate levels several days into their stay in ICU. However, the use of severity of illness scores are potentially misleading because metabolic acidosis itself might lead to worsening disease severity. Indeed, most severity scoring systems take into account acid–base variables and/or lactate. Thus, for our model we included age as covariate. We also report the admission diagnostic category in Table 2. The nature of our database (laboratory values) also limited our logistic regression model. Ideally we would have included treatment variables (saline and other resuscitation fluid) as well as other clinical variables (hemodynamics). Another limitation involved our initial selection process. The 'suspicion of lactic acidosis' excluded several patients in whom a metabolic acidosis may have been present for other reasons but was not suspected. The categories of metabolic acidosis were used to describe the predominating anion. Rather than using an arbitrary definition of hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis that relies on an absolute value of chloride, we first eliminated all other causes of what has been traditionally classified as an anion gap metabolic acidosis (SIG or lactate). Our classification scheme leaves open the possibility that a combined lactic/SIG acidosis would have been misclassified as hyperchloremic. Conversely, some hyperchloremic cases could have been misclassified as either SIG or lactic acidosis if pre-existing or concomitant metabolic alkalosis was also present, decreasing the apparent impact of chloride. However, these limitations exist with any acid–base classification scheme and given that hyperchloremic acidosis is defined on the basis of 'acidosis without an AG', rather than on the basis of chloride levels, some imprecision is always going to be present.

### Hemodynamic consequences of severe lactic acidosis in shock states: from bench to bedside [^114C26LV]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Epidemiology and outcome of severe lactic acidosis

Lactic acidosis is one of the most common biological concerns for intensivists. Nevertheless, clinical studies assessing the incidence and outcome of lactic acidosis are sparse and are mostly retrospective or prospective in nature with small sample sizes.

For this review, the most convincing prospective multi-center study, conducted in 2011 by Jung and colleagues, noted severe lactic acidosis in 6% of the studied population (200/2,550 patients); that is, with pH 7.09 ± 0.11 with high lactatemia values. Eighty-three percent of these patients were treated with vasopressors with a mortality rate of 57%. In this study, lactatemia and the swiftness of lactic acidosis correction were linked with survival. Interestingly, only 18% exhibited a slight coexistent respiratory acidosis at admission.

Clearly, a causal relationship between lactic acidosis and mortality has yet to be established. For example, in metformin-associated lactic acidosis, even with pH values most often around 7.0, the observed mortality rate was 25%. However, for the same pH values during shock, regardless of origin, no survival was reported. Consequently, severe lactic acidosis is much more of a precipitator than a direct causal factor of mortality. Lactic acidosis probably contributes to the decompensation of underlying comorbidities and, hence, to the mortality rate.

### Critical care nephrology: management of acid-base disorders with CRRT [^115LpL1Y]. Kidney International (2012). Low credibility.

Normal acid-base homeostasis is severely challenged in the intensive care setting. In this review, we address acid-base disturbances, with a special focus on the use of continuous (rather than intermittent) extracorporeal technologies in critical ill patients with acute kidney injury. We consider hypercapnic acidosis and lactic acidosis as examples in which continuous modalities may have different roles and indications than the traditional intermittent approaches to renal replacement therapy. Hypercapnic acidosis develops as a consequence of alveolar hypoventilation. In this condition, correction of pH above 7.2 is not currently recommended, and may even abrogate the beneficial effects of hypercapnic acidosis on overall outcomes. Extracorporeal technologies support lung protection while maintaining overall patient homeostasis. Similarly, in lactic acidosis, current evidence does not support bicarbonate infusions to correct acidosis. The management of lactic acidosis should correct the underlying causative disturbances. Most often, lactic acidosis is a biomarker denoting unfavorable outcomes, rather than an intrinsic pathogenetic mechanism. Extracorporeal procedures may assist in the removal of pathogenic drugs or toxins, as well as partially correcting acidemia. Whether or not these approaches will permit normalization of systemic pH, and the impact of these approaches on patient outcomes, needs to be addressed with prospective controlled trials.

### Hemodynamic consequences of severe lactic acidosis in shock states: from bench to bedside [^115gPdzD]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Shock was recently redefined as a clinical state of acute circulatory failure with inadequate oxygen utilization and/or delivery by the cells resulting in cellular dysoxia/hypoxia. In this setting, shock-associated lactic acidosis is the principal but not exclusive cause of metabolic acidosis in the shock state. Current clinical practice considers a pH ≤ 7.35 and lactatemia > 2.0 mmol.l −1 with a PaCO 2 ≤ 42 mmHg as defining lactic acidosis. In contrast, the definition of severe lactic acidosis is unclear. Critical care physicians usually consider that metabolic acidosis with a pH < 7.2 has deleterious hemodynamic effects and requires symptomatic treatment. Nevertheless, despite optimal management with adequate supportive and etiological therapy, shock and severe lactic acidosis (that is, with pH < 7.2) remain associated with an observed high mortality rate of about 50%, while no survival has been reported for severe lactic acidosis with shock under pH 7.0.

Numerous studies have assessed the cardiovascular consequences of severe metabolic acidosis, including lactic acidosis. These experimental studies demonstrated that severe metabolic acidosis worsens cardiovascular function by exacerbating myocardial dysfunction and hyporesponsiveness to vasopressors. Nevertheless, such findings have yet to be formally observed in human studies.

Etiological treatment is essential while symptomatic lactic acidosis correction remains a contentious issue. It is unknown whether alkalinization is beneficial in severe lactic acidosis. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign recommends against symptomatic treatment in lactic acidotic patients with a pH > 7.15 for the purpose of improving hemodynamic status. Alternatively, the effect of alkalinization on hemodynamics and vasopressor requirements at pH ≤ 7.15 is currently unknown. Nevertheless, despite the lack of relevant results on its efficacy, alkalinization is still largely prescribed in instances of severe acidosis with pH ≤ 7.15.

### A review of bicarbonate use in common clinical scenarios [^117RtCV8]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

In summary, there is no mortality benefit or demonstrated improvement in hemodynamics with use of sodium bicarbonate in lactic acidosis, although emerging data suggest patients with persistent metabolic acidosis and acute kidney injury may benefit from an infusion of bicarbonate after initial resuscitation. Emphasis should be placed on treatment of the underlying cause of the acidosis.

Recommendation

The routine use of bicarbonate supplementation for lactic acidosis and shock states is not recommended. There may be a role for an infusion of sodium bicarbonate after initial resuscitation in patients with acute kidney injury and pH < 7.2, although data are limited, and ongoing trials are evaluating benefit (Level of evidence: B).

Cardiac Arrest

The benefit of rapid pushes of ampules of sodium bicarbonate therapy in cardiac arrest is controversial. Decreased perfusion leads to hypoxia, anaerobic glycolysis, and generation of lactate. In addition, cessation of spontaneous ventilation causes buildup of carbon dioxide, decreases coronary perfusion pressure, and contributes to a mixed metabolic and respiratory acidosis. Acidemia has detrimental effects on hemodynamics, increases myocardial irritability, and lowers the threshold for dysrhythmias. Indeed, the use of sodium bicarbonate was initially part of Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS) guidelines dating back to 1976. However, over the years, data emerged that did not show improvement in resuscitation outcomes with bicarbonate supplementation, thus calling into question the routine use of sodium bicarbonate during resuscitation. Subsequently, incorporation of sodium bicarbonate during cardiac arrest began to fall out of favor, instead emphasis has shifted to early defibrillation and high-quality cardiopulmonary resuscitation to augment coronary perfusion with improved patient centered outcomes.

### Hemodynamic consequences of severe lactic acidosis in shock states: from bench to bedside [^1133dUP1]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Is there any proven benefit of systemic alkalinization in severe metabolic (including lactic) acidosis?

Literature regarding the potential beneficial effect of alkalinization in correcting metabolic acidosis is controversial. As reported above, severe lactic acidosis with pH ≤ 7.15 appears to be experimentally detrimental for organ functions. Consequently, even if not formally demonstrated in clinical trials, it would appear reasonable to quickly correct the pH in order to restore cellular functions. In the absence of conclusive clinical studies, however, most of the following treatment options are consequently based on experimental data.

Sodium bicarbonate

Sodium bicarbonate has been removed from the treatment algorithm in advanced cardiac life support. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign also recommends against the use of sodium bicarbonate therapy for the purpose of improving hemodynamics or reducing vasopressor requirements in patients with severe lactic acidosis with pH > 7.15. Despite these strong guidelines, in the most recent survey on this topic, 67% of intensivists recommend administration of base to patients with metabolic acidosis, including lactic acidosis. The blood pH at which base therapy should be initiated remains nonetheless controversial. Thirty-seven percent of these intensivists continue to begin symptomatic treatment of metabolic acidosis for a pH ≥ 7.1. Such discrepancy between the literature and bedside practice warrants further explanation.

Clinical studies investigating sodium bicarbonate therapy in situations of severe lactic acidosis have always reported an increase in extracellular pH whereas experimental data are more divergent. By contrast, intracellular pH always decreases after sodium bicarbonate administration (Table 1). The main explanation for this so-called paradoxical intracellular acidosis is based on the reaction of sodium bicarbonate with a proton to form water and carbon dioxide:

### A case of concurrent metformin-associated lactic acidosis and euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis [^112uedtB]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Combination therapy with metformin and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors is strongly recommended for adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus who have inadequate glycemic control. These inhibitors are particularly indicated for patients with a history or high risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, heart failure, or chronic kidney disease. Consequently, the number of patients receiving both metformin and SGLT2 inhibitors is expected to increase. However, these treatments pose a risk of life-threatening acidoses, specifically metformin-associated lactic acidosis (MALA) and euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis (euDKA), which require prompt differentiation and distinct treatments.

Case Report

We present the case of a woman in her 50s with chronic heart failure who had been treated for type 2 diabetes for 15 years. After dehydration caused by working in hot conditions and fluid restriction, she presented with dehydration, fatigue, respiratory distress, hypotension, tachypnea, hypothermia, acute renal failure, hypoglycemia, and severe metabolic acidosis. Despite supportive care, lactic acidosis persisted, leading to a diagnosis of MALA. Hemodialysis improved lactate levels, but a persistent anion gap and elevated β-hydroxybutyrate level confirmed euDKA. Metabolic abnormalities resolved with continuous insulin infusion and the patient was discharged without sequelae. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? The combination of MALA and euDKA represents rare but potentially fatal conditions requiring distinct diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. With their growing use for type 2 diabetes management and cardiovascular/kidney benefits, emergency physicians are more likely to encounter complications associated with these medications.

### Metformin hydrochloride (Fortamet) [^114k4a96]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

WARNINGS

Lactic Acidosis:

Lactic acidosis is a rare, but serious, metabolic
complication that can occur due to metformin accumulation during treatment with
FORTAMET (metformin hydrochloride) Extended-Release
Tablets; when it occurs, it is fatal in approximately 50% of cases. Lactic
acidosis may also occur in association with a number of pathophysiologic
conditions, including diabetes mellitus, and whenever there is significant
tissue hypoperfusion and hypoxemia. Lactic acidosis is characterized by elevated
blood lactate levels (> 5 mmol/ L), decreased blood pH, electrolyte
disturbances with an increased anion gap, and an increased lactate/pyruvate
ratio. When metformin is implicated as the cause of lactic acidosis, metformin
plasma levels > 5 μg/mL are generally found.

The reported incidence of lactic acidosis in patients
receiving metformin hydrochloride is very low (approximately 0.03 cases/1000
patient-years, with approximately 0.015 fatal cases/1000 patient-years).
Reported cases have occurred primarily in diabetic patients with significant
renal insufficiency, including both intrinsic renal disease and renal
hypoperfusion, often in the setting of multiple concomitant medical/ surgical
problems and multiple concomitant medications. Patients with congestive heart
failure requiring pharmacologic management, in particular those with unstable or
acute congestive heart failure who are at risk of hypoperfusion and hypoxemia,
are at increased risk of lactic acidosis. The risk of lactic acidosis increases
with the degree of renal dysfunction and the patient's age. The risk of lactic
acidosis may, therefore, be significantly decreased by regular monitoring of
renal function in patients taking FORTAMET (metformin
hydrochloride) Extended-Release Tablets and by use of the minimum effective dose
of FORTAMET. In particular, treatment of the elderly
should be accompanied by careful monitoring of renal function. FORTAMET treatment should not be initiated in patients ≥ 80 years of
age unless measurement of creatinine clearance demonstrates that renal function
is not reduced, as these patients are more susceptible to developing lactic
acidosis. In addition, FORTAMET should be promptly
withheld in the presence of any condition associated with hypoxemia,
dehydration, or sepsis. Because impaired hepatic function may significantly
limit the ability to clear lactate, FORTAMET should
generally be avoided in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic
disease. Patients should be cautioned against excessive alcohol intake, either
acute or chronic, when taking FORTAMET, since alcohol
potentiates the effects of metformin hydrochloride on lactate metabolism. In
addition, FORTAMET should be temporarily discontinued
prior to any intravascular radiocontrast study and for any surgical procedure
(see also PRECAUTIONS).

### Management of acute metabolic acidosis in the ICU: sodium bicarbonate and renal replacement therapy [^112kJ47g]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Sodium bicarbonate for subtypes of metabolic acidosis

Administration of sodium bicarbonate has been considered for DKA not only because sodium bicarbonate reverses the acidotic status but because acidosis possibly contributes to insulin resistance. However, a retrospective single center study from the USA reported that sodium bicarbonate administration in the emergency department was not associated with time to resolution of acidosis in patients with DKA with a pH < 7.0. There was also no difference in hospital length of stay. A systematic review in 2011 found that sodium bicarbonate did not shorten the duration of acidosis, ketosis, or glycemic levels. Furthermore, there was a high incidence of hypokalemia that required correction in patients who received sodium bicarbonate. These findings imply that the beneficial effects of sodium bicarbonate administration for DKA might be limited. However, the systematic review by Chua et al. revealed a lack of rigorous randomized clinical trials that assessed patient-centered outcomes in these patients.

Sodium bicarbonate for lactic acidosis has been compared with saline in two small-scale randomized, crossover, single center trials. Cooper et al. reported that sodium bicarbonate administration increased pH and PCO2 with no change in blood pressure or cardiac output. Similarly, Mathieu et al. found an increase in pH but no change in hemodynamic parameters, including cardiac index.

For cardiac arrest, several observational studies have reported an increase in the rate of return of spontaneous circulation in patients receiving sodium bicarbonate. However, one study found that this treatment was associated with a worse survival rate and neurological outcomes to hospital discharge. A pilot RCT showed no improvement in patient mortality, return of spontaneous circulation rate, or neurologically favorable status in treated patients. At present, routine use of sodium bicarbonate is not recommended for cardiopulmonary resuscitation.

### Recognising and managing albuterol-induced lactic acidosis [^116Hhk4f]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Patient's perspective

When I first started experiencing shortness of breath, I assumed it was just my COPD acting up. I had been using my albuterol inhaler more frequently, thinking it would help, but things only got worse. I ended up in the emergency room, and that's when they noticed my elevated lactate levels. At first, I was really scared, I didn't know what was causing it, and I feared the worst, like sepsis. The doctors ran so many tests, and I'm grateful they finally figured out that it was the albuterol causing the problem. Once they adjusted my treatment, I started feeling better almost immediately. Looking back, I wish I had known that using my inhaler too much could cause something like this. It's been a relief to recover, and now I'm much more careful with my medication. I'm thankful for the care I received and the thoroughness of the doctors in figuring this out.

Learning points

Recognise albuterol as a potential cause of lactic acidosis, especially in patients with elevated lactate levels without signs of tissue hypoxia or infection; it should be considered in the differential diagnosis.
Adjusting the frequency of albuterol administration may effectively resolve the acidosis, preventing unnecessary diagnostic investigations and avoiding the need to discontinue bronchodilator therapy.
Early identification of albuterol-induced lactic acidosis can streamline patient care by avoiding extensive workups and treatments aimed at sepsis or other causes, ensuring more efficient and targeted management.

### Type A versus type B lactic acidosis in the context of undiagnosed B-cell lymphoma [^113F3PGr]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Lactic acidosis, characterised by an imbalance between lactate production and clearance, is classified into type A and type B. Type A is associated with tissue hypoxia and shock, while type B occurs without hypoxia, often due to metabolic disturbances, such as cancer-related metabolic reprogramming, known as the Warburg effect. This case series presents two patients with undiagnosed B-cell lymphoma who exhibited distinct forms of lactic acidosis. The first patient, with septic shock and end-organ hypoperfusion, developed type A lactic acidosis, with escalating lactate levels despite aggressive resuscitation. The second patient, with stable haemodynamics but persistently elevated lactate, exhibited type B lactic acidosis, likely due to the Warburg effect of lymphoma. These cases underscore the importance of differentiating between type A and type B lactic acidosis, as the underlying aetiology guides treatment strategies. Early recognition of the cause is crucial for optimal management and patient outcomes, particularly in malignancy-associated metabolic disturbances.

### Lactic acidosis: current treatments and future directions [^115VXQdL]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Mortality rates associated with severe lactic acidosis (blood pH < 7.2) due to sepsis or low-flow states are high. Eliminating the triggering conditions remains the most effective therapy. Although recommended by some, administration of sodium bicarbonate does not improve cardiovascular function or reduce mortality. This failure has been attributed to both reduction in serum calcium concentration and generation of excess carbon dioxide with intracellular acidification. In animal studies, hyperventilation and infusion of calcium during sodium bicarbonate administration improves cardiovascular function, suggesting that this approach could allow expression of the positive aspects of sodium bicarbonate. Other buffers, such as THAM or Carbicarb, or dialysis might also provide base with fewer untoward effects. Examination of these therapies in humans is warranted. The cellular injury associated with lactic acidosis is partly due to activation of NHE1, a cell-membrane Na(+)/H(+) exchanger. In animal studies, selective NHE1 inhibitors improve cardiovascular function, ameliorate lactic acidosis, and reduce mortality, supporting future research into their possible use in humans. Two main mechanisms contribute to lactic acid accumulation in sepsis and low-flow states: tissue hypoxia and epinephrine-induced stimulation of aerobic glycolysis. Targeting these mechanisms could allow for more specific therapy. This Acid-Base and Electrolyte Teaching Case presents a patient with acute lactic acidosis and describes current and future approaches to treatment.

### Metformin-induced lactic acidosis: no one left behind [^114JtgXm]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Metformin is a safe drug when correctly used in properly selected patients. In real life, however, associated lactic acidosis has been repeatedly, although rarely, reported. The term metformin-induced lactic acidosis refers to cases that cannot be explained by any major risk factor other than drug accumulation, usually due to renal failure. Treatment consists of vital function support and drug removal, mainly achieved by renal replacement therapy. Despite dramatic clinical presentation, the prognosis of metformin-induced lactic acidosis is usually surprisingly good.

WARNING: LACTIC ACIDOSIS

Post-marketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis have resulted in death, hypothermia, hypotension, and resistant bradyarrhythmias. The onset of metformin-associated lactic acidosis is often subtle, accompanied only by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, respiratory distress, somnolence, and abdominal pain. Metformin-associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate levels (> 5 mmol/Liter), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio; and metformin plasma levels generally > 5 mcg/mL [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis include renal impairment, concomitant use of certain drugs (e.g., carbonic anhydrase inhibitors such as topiramate), age 65 years old or greater, having a radiological study with contrast, surgery and other procedures, hypoxic states (e.g., acute congestive heart failure), excessive alcohol intake, and hepatic impairment.

Steps to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis in these high risk groups are provided [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Contraindications (4), Warnings and precautions (5.1)].

If metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, immediately discontinue metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets and institute general supportive measures in a hospital setting. Prompt hemodialysis is recommended [see Warnings and Precautions(5.1)].

### Pioglitazone hydrochloride and metformin hydrochloride (actoplus Met) [^113mnFMn]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

Metformin hydrochloride

Lactic Acidosis: Lactic acidosis is a rare, but serious, metabolic complication that can occur due to metformin accumulation during treatment with ACTOPLUS MET (pioglitazone hydrochloride and metformin hydrochloride) tablets; when it occurs, it is fatal in approximately 50% of cases. Lactic acidosis may also occur in association with a number of pathophysiologic conditions, including diabetes mellitus, and whenever there is significant tissue hypoperfusion and hypoxemia. Lactic acidosis is characterized by elevated blood lactate levels (> 5 mmol/L), decreased blood pH, electrolyte disturbances with an increased anion gap, and an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio. When metformin is implicated as the cause of lactic acidosis, metformin plasma levels > 5 µg/mL are generally found.

The reported incidence of lactic acidosis in patients receiving metformin hydrochloride is very low (approximately 0.03 cases/1000 patient-years, with approximately 0.015 fatal cases/1000 patient-years). In more than 20,000 patient-years exposure to metformin in clinical trials, there were no reports of lactic acidosis. Reported cases have occurred primarily in diabetic patients with significant renal insufficiency, including both intrinsic renal disease and renal hypoperfusion, often in the setting of multiple concomitant medical/surgical problems and multiple concomitant medications. Patients with congestive heart failure requiring pharmacologic management, in particular those with unstable or acute congestive heart failure who are at risk of hypoperfusion and hypoxemia, are at increased risk of lactic acidosis. The risk of lactic acidosis increases with the degree of renal dysfunction and the patient's age. The risk of lactic acidosis may, therefore, be significantly decreased by regular monitoring of renal function in patients taking metformin and by use of the minimum effective dose of metformin. In particular, treatment of the elderly should be accompanied by careful monitoring of renal function. Metformin treatment should not be initiated in patients ≥ 80 years of age unless measurement of creatinine clearance demonstrates that renal function is not reduced, as these patients are more susceptible to developing lactic acidosis. In addition, metformin should be promptly withheld in the presence of any condition associated with hypoxemia, dehydration, or sepsis. Because impaired hepatic function may significantly limit the ability to clear lactate, metformin should generally be avoided in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease. Patients should be cautioned against excessive alcohol intake, either acute or chronic, when taking metformin, since alcohol potentiates the effects of metformin hydrochloride on lactate metabolism. In addition, metformin should be temporarily discontinued prior to any intravascular radiocontrast study and for any surgical procedure (see PRECAUTIONS, General: Metformin hydrochloride).

### Recognising and managing albuterol-induced lactic acidosis [^112Va9M8]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Several studies have described the association between beta-adrenergic agonists and lactic acidosis. Gluck et al first described the relationship between beta-adrenergic agonists and hyperlactatemia in 1989, reporting that patients receiving albuterol for bronchospasm developed elevated lactate levels without metabolic acidosis. In a later study, Bellinger et al demonstrated that beta-adrenergic stimulation leads to a significant increase in lactate production, particularly in resting humans. Clinical observations support this mechanism. Marik and Bankov reported a case where lactic acidosis developed following the administration of beta-agonists in sepsis-associated acute lung injury, suggesting a direct relationship between beta-adrenergic stimulation and increased lactate production. Other studies have also shown that patients' lactate levels normalise after reducing or discontinuing beta-agonist therapy.

A review of the literature reveals several cases of albuterol-induced lactic acidosis, most commonly in the context of asthma or COPD exacerbations. Haupt et al described a case where a patient receiving high doses of albuterol developed lactic acidosis, which resolved after discontinuation of the drug. Similarly, Theodosiou et al documented a case of albuterol-induced lactic acidosis in a young woman, with resolution following a reduction in beta-agonist therapy. Sharif et al reported a case of a young woman with an asthma exacerbation who developed severe lactic acidosis following high-dose salbutamol therapy, highlighting the role of beta-adrenergic stimulation in lactate production. Their findings further support that beta-agonist-induced lactic acidosis can occur independently of tissue hypoxia or sepsis and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of unexplained hyperlactatemia. Similarly, our case of a COPD patient who developed significant lactic acidosis following frequent albuterol nebulisation expands the clinical context of this phenomenon, emphasising the need for clinicians to recognise this potential adverse effect in both asthma and COPD patients. In most cases, the patients developed lactic acidosis after receiving frequent or high doses of albuterol, either through nebulised treatments or inhalers. The elevated lactate levels typically returned to normal within 24 to 72 hours after adjusting the dose or frequency of albuterol administration.

### Hemodynamic consequences of severe lactic acidosis in shock states: from bench to bedside [^116kvFRd]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Deleterious hemodynamic effects of severe lactic acidosis are largely suggested by experimental data, although not fully confirmed by human studies. Pending the effectiveness of an etiological treatment, there is no efficient and validated symptomatic therapy at hand to correct a life-threatening metabolic acidosis. Upcoming research in this field should be focused on the optimal strategy to treat severe metabolic acidosis, including symptomatic therapy.

### The European guideline on management of major bleeding and coagulopathy following trauma: fourth edition [^1168ApbT]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Serum lactate and base deficit

Recommendation 11

We recommend serum lactate and/or base deficit measurements as sensitive tests to estimate and monitor the extent of bleeding and shock. (Grade 1B)

Rationale

Serum lactate has been used as a diagnostic parameter and prognostic marker of haemorrhagic shock since the 1960s. The amount of lactate produced by anaerobic glycolysis is an indirect marker of oxygen debt, tissue hypoperfusion and the severity of haemorrhagic shock. Similarly, base deficit values derived from arterial blood gas analysis provide an indirect estimation of global tissue acidosis due to impaired perfusion. Vincent and colleagues showed the value of serial lactate measurements for predicting survival in a prospective study in patients with circulatory shock. This study showed that changes in lactate concentration provide an early and objective evaluation of a patient's response to therapy and suggested that repeated lactate determinations represent a reliable prognostic index for patients with circulatory shock. Abramson and colleagues performed a prospective observational study in patients with multiple traumatic injuries to evaluate the correlation between lactate clearance and survival. All patients in whom lactate levels returned to the normal range (≤ 2 mmol/l) within 24 h survived. Survival decreased to 77.8% if normalisation occurred within 48 h and to 13.6% in those patients in whom lactate levels were elevated above 2 mmol/l for more than 48 h. These findings were confirmed in a study by Manikis et al. who showed that initial lactate levels were higher in non-survivors after major trauma and that prolongation of time to normalisation of lactate levels of more than 24 h was associated with the development of post-traumatic organ failure. The determination of lactate and/or base deficit may be particularly important in penetrating trauma. In this type of trauma, triage vital signs such as blood pressure, heart rate and respiratory rate do not reflect the severity of injury and are not related to lactate or base deficit levels.

### Recognising and managing albuterol-induced lactic acidosis [^114vTChN]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Background

Lactic acidosis is a life-threatening condition that can occur due to a variety of factors, traditionally classified into two types. Type A lactic acidosis is caused by tissue hypoxia and is often associated with conditions such as shock, sepsis or cardiac arrest. Type B lactic acidosis, on the other hand, occurs in the absence of hypoxia and is often related to metabolic conditions or drug-induced effects. Among the drugs associated with type B lactic acidosis, beta-adrenergic agonists, such as albuterol, are less commonly recognised. Incidence of lactic acidosis has recently increased with sepsis protocol that followed in emergency departments. The 1-hour bundle of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign published in 2018 recommends as a first measure the determination of the lactate serum concentrations, and increased values should be closely monitored.

Beta-adrenergic agonists are frequently used in the management of acute chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations due to their bronchodilatory effects. However, they can also have metabolic side effects, such as the induction of lactic acidosis. Despite several case reports and clinical studies pointing to this association, awareness of albuterol-induced lactic acidosis remains low in clinical practice. This report highlights the case of a COPD patient who developed lactic acidosis after the administration of albuterol, emphasising the importance of recognising this condition to avoid unnecessary and invasive investigations for other causes.

### Recognising and managing albuterol-induced lactic acidosis [^113ToUzS]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Summary

Lactic acidosis is a serious condition often associated with tissue hypoxia or sepsis, but it can also be caused by beta-adrenergic agonists such as albuterol. This report describes a case of albuterol-induced lactic acidosis in a male patient in his 70s with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation. The patient presented with progressively worsening dyspnoea and increased albuterol use. During the initial evaluation, an elevated lactate level was observed, which further increased after albuterol treatment in the emergency room. A thorough sepsis workup was performed, yielding negative results, which ultimately led to the diagnosis of albuterol-induced lactic acidosis. After reducing the frequency of albuterol treatments, the patient's lactate levels normalised. This case underscores the importance of considering medication-induced causes of lactic acidosis, particularly in patients with respiratory conditions who are frequently administered beta-adrenergic agonists. Recognising this under-reported phenomenon can help clinicians avoid unnecessary sepsis workups and ensure more accurate treatment plans.

### Metabolic acidosis in the critically ill: part 1. classification and pathophysiology [^115RbJd4]. Anaesthesia (2008). Low credibility.

Metabolic acidaemia (pH < 7.35 not primarily related to hypoventilation) is common amongst the critically ill and it is essential that clinicians caring for such patients have an understanding of the common causes. The exclusive elimination routes of volatile (carbon dioxide), organic (lactic and ketone) and inorganic (phosphate and sulphate) acids mean compensation for a defect in any one is limited and requires separate provision during critical illness. We discuss the models available to diagnose metabolic acidosis including CO2/HCO3(-) and physical chemistry-derived (Stewart or Fencl-Stewart) approaches, but we propose that the base excess and anion gap, corrected for hypoalbuminaemia and iatrogenic hyperchloraemia, remain most appropriate for clinical usage. Finally we provide some tips for interpreting respiratory responses to metabolic acidosis and how to reach a working diagnosis, the consequences of which are considered in Part 2 of this review.

### Demystifying lactate in the emergency department [^115G8oLL]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

The role of lactic acid and its conjugate base, lactate, has evolved during the past decade in the care of patients in the emergency department (ED). A recent national sepsis quality measure has led to increased use of serum lactate in the ED, but many causes for hyperlactatemia exist outside of sepsis. We provide a review of the biology of lactate production and metabolism, the many causes of hyperlactatemia, and evidence on its use as a marker in prognosis and resuscitation. Additionally, we review the evolving role of lactate in sepsis care. We provide recommendations to aid lactate interpretation in the ED and highlight areas for future research.

### Blood lactate monitoring in critically ill patients: a systematic health technology assessment [^112Ld1ix]. Critical Care Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To decide whether the use of blood lactate monitoring in critical care practice is appropriate. We performed a systematic health technology assessment as blood lactate monitoring has been implemented widely but its clinical value in critically ill patients has never been evaluated properly.

Data Source

PubMed, other databases, and citation review.

Study Selection

We searched for lactate combined with critically ill patients as the target patient population. Two reviewers independently selected studies based on relevance for the following questions: Does lactate measurement: 1) perform well in a laboratory setting? 2) provide information in a number of clinical situations? 3) relate to metabolic acidosis? 4) increase workers' confidence? 5) alter therapeutic decisions? 6) result in benefit to patients? 7) result in similar benefits in your own setting? 8) result in benefits which are worth the extra costs?

Data Extraction and Synthesis

We concluded that blood lactate measurement in critically ill patients: 1) is accurate in terms of measurement technique but adequate understanding of the (an)aerobic etiology is required for its correct interpretation; 2) provides not only diagnostic but also important prognostic information; 3) should be measured directly instead of estimated from other acid-base variables; 4) has an unknown effect on healthcare workers' confidence; 5) can alter therapeutic decisions; 6) could potentially improve patient outcome when combined with a treatment algorithm to optimize oxygen delivery, but this has only been shown indirectly; 7) is likely to have similar benefits in critical care settings worldwide; and 8) has an unknown cost-effectiveness.

Conclusions

The use of blood lactate monitoring has a place in risk-stratification in critically ill patients, but it is unknown whether the routine use of lactate as a resuscitation end point improves outcome. This warrants randomized controlled studies on the efficacy of lactate-directed therapy.
