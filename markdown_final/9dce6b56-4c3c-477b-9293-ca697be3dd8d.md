## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the relationship between cephalexin (Keflex) and Clostridioides difficile infection, including the level of risk, mechanisms, risk modifiers, comparative risk versus other antibiotics, guideline-based risk stratification, mitigation strategies, and practical clinical actions when prescribing cephalexin. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what cephalexin is pharmacologically and how that might influence C. difficile risk. Then, I should verify what the FDA labeling says about CDI with cephalexin. Next, I will examine mechanistic plausibility. After that, I should review epidemiologic and comparative risk data across antibiotics. Then, I will stratify patient-level risk modifiers. Next, I should review guideline-based recommendations on stewardship and specific agents. Finally, I will translate this into practical prescribing advice and a risk-benefit framework for decision-making.

> Let me first confirm the drug identity and context. Cephalexin is a first-generation oral cephalosporin indicated for uncomplicated skin and soft tissue infections, respiratory tract infections, genitourinary infections, and some bone infections, and it is commonly used in outpatient and dental settings, which means exposure is frequent in community practice and dental care contexts [^116sX1X2] [^114GKzfc].

> Wait, let me verify the label-level signal for CDI with cephalexin. The FDA prescribing information includes a boxed warning and section on Clostridioides difficile–associated diarrhea stating that CDAD has been reported with nearly all antibacterial agents, including cephalexin, and that severity can range from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis, which confirms a class effect signal even for first-generation oral cephalosporins [^112Q1b9U].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about mechanism before I confirm it. The pathophysiology is antibiotic-induced dysbiosis with overgrowth of C. difficile and toxin production, so by altering the normal colonic flora, cephalexin can create permissive conditions for spore germination and proliferation; I should also remember that symptom onset can be delayed beyond the antibiotic course, sometimes up to 2 months, so a temporal gap does not exclude CDI risk from cephalexin [^112Q1b9U].

> Next, I should review epidemiologic risk signals and comparative data. The highest-risk antibiotics repeatedly implicated are third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones, clindamycin, and carbapenems, whereas first-generation cephalosporins like cephalexin are generally considered lower-risk within the class, yet pediatric data show that cephalosporins still confer increased risk of community-associated CDI relative to amoxicillin, reinforcing a nonzero risk even for early-generation agents [^114VHrEv] [^115DvPt6] [^112PmDrp] [^111zzqwQ].

> I need to check risk modifiers that can magnify cephalexin-associated CDI risk. Older age, multiple comorbidities, hospitalization, immunosuppression, prior CDI, concomitant PPI use, and longer antibiotic durations all elevate baseline risk, and cumulative antibiotic exposure further compounds hazard; asymptomatic carriage also carries a markedly elevated baseline CDI hazard, with antibiotic exposure amplifying risk differently in carriers versus noncarriers in observational cohorts [^113VzHFj] [^1121Ekxh] [^114b6L8h] [^116CpFTX] [^116VArrJ].

> Let me consider comparative context and avoid overstating. Clindamycin, fluoroquinolones, and third-generation cephalosporins consistently show higher association with CDI than first-generation agents; cephalexin's risk is not negligible, but it is lower than these high-risk classes, and this distinction matters when choosing among oral options for skin and soft tissue infections or UTIs in patients with CDI risk factors [^114VHrEv] [^115DvPt6].

> I should confirm guideline-based recommendations to anchor practice. IDSA/SHEA and SHEA prevention guidance emphasize minimizing frequency, duration, and number of high-risk antibiotics, with explicit targeting of clindamycin, fluoroquinolones, and broad-spectrum cephalosporins, while recommending implementation of stewardship programs that reduce CDI incidence by roughly 30–50%, which supports favoring narrower agents when clinically appropriate [^114jgARP] [^1133FYzK] [^114KiZcB]

Evaluation of suspected Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) — When CDI is suspected, a disease-specific history should be performed emphasizing risk factors, symptoms, underlying comorbidities, and signs of severe or fulminant disease. Grade of recommendation: Strong recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 1C. Symptoms typically manifest soon after starting antibiotic therapy for another disease process, but can be delayed for up to 3 months after discontinuation of antimicrobial therapy. The strongest risk factor for developing CDI is recent antibiotic use (within 3 months), and increased duration of exposure and number of antibiotics used are associated with higher risk for developing CDI, with drugs such as clindamycin, ampicillin, penicillin with beta-lactamase inhibitors, fluoroquinolones, and thirdgeneration cephalosporins more commonly associated with developing CDI.

Conclusions

This cohort study emphasizes the need for nuanced CDI prevention strategies that address distinct risks in carriers and noncarriers of C difficile. While antibiotic stewardship is crucial for reducing CDI in general, additional approaches are needed for carriers to mitigate their substantially high baseline risk. Further research should explore modifiable factors beyond antibiotic use to improve outcomes in patients with CDI and to reduce the overall burden of CDI in health care settings. Shortened duration of antibiotic therapy and restriction of BLBLIs may reduce CDI among hospitalized patients.

Key Points

Question

What is the hazard of Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) between asymptomatic carriers compared with noncarriers of C difficile, and is this hazard associated with antibiotic exposure?

Findings

In this cohort study of 33 756 hospitalizations among 23 001 patients, asymptomatic carriers had a higher hazard of CDI. Antibiotic exposure, particularly to amoxicillin and clavulanate and piperacillin and tazobactam, was associated with an increased hazard of CDI, especially among noncarriers, with no additional hazard among carriers.

Meaning

These findings suggest that while antibiotic stewardship may be associated with a reduced hazard of CDI in asymptomatic carriers given their already elevated hazard, additional strategies may be warranted.

Antibiotic-associated diarrhea and Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) occur frequently among adults. The pathophysiology of CDI is related to disruption of normal gut flora and risk factors include hospitalization, use of antibiotic therapy, and older age. Clinical manifestations can range from mild disease to toxic megacolon. Diagnosis is challenging and is based on a combination of clinical symptoms and diagnostic tests. Therapy includes cessation of antibiotics, or use of other agents depending on the severity of illness. Many novel agents for the treatment and prevention of CDI show promise and are under investigation.

### Evidence-based clinical practice guideline on antibiotic use for the urgent management of pulpal-and periapical-related dental pain and intraoral swelling: a report from the American dental association [^117GMboX]. Journal of the American Dental Association (2019). High credibility.

American Dental Association guideline — undesirable effects of systemic antibiotics are quantified across outcomes, including community-associated Clostridioides difficile (C. difficile) infection, antibiotic-resistant infections, costs, hospitalizations, and anaphylaxis. Of 10,000 people with a community-associated C. difficile infection in 2011, approximately 640 may have been exposed to antibiotics received from a dentist; of 10,000 people with a community-associated C. difficile infection, approximately 80 people probably died due to exposure to antibiotics. At least 2 million people may experience an antibiotic-resistant infection annually in the United States, and annually, there may have been approximately 23,000 deaths due to antibiotic-resistant infections. In 2011, the mean community-associated C. difficile — attributable cost was likely $3 billion, and the guideline authors approximated that in 2011 $300 million may have been related to community-associated C. difficile infections that were associated with a dental prescription for antibiotics. In 2008, antibiotic resistance may have caused $20 billion in direct costs with an additional $35 billion associated with productivity losses; the guideline authors approximate that $2 billion in direct costs with an additional $3.5 billion associated with productivity losses may have been related to antibiotic resistance associated with a dental prescription for antibiotics. Of 10,000 people with a community-associated C. difficile infection, 1,270 patients probably listed community-associated C. difficile infection as the primary reason for admission to the hospital, and the guideline authors approximated that in 2006, 0.24% of infection-related hospitalizations due to antibiotic-resistant infections may have been associated with a dental prescription for antibiotics. Of 100,000 hospitalizations from 1995 through 2013, approximately 46 patients may have reported anaphylaxis due to a penicillin drug class and received the antibiotic from a dentist; 2 patients may have reported anaphylaxis due to amoxicillin and received the antibiotic from a dentist; 6 patients may have reported anaphylaxis due to a cephalosporin drug class and received the antibiotic from a dentist; and 1 patient may have reported anaphylaxis due to cephalexin and received the antibiotic from a dentist.

### Antibiotic use and the risk of hospital-onset Clostridioides difficile infection [^116VNYpS]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Clostridioides difficile is a leading cause of health care–associated infections. Patients with C difficile infection (CDI) endure considerable morbidity and mortality, while health care facilities face substantial costs related to treatment and infection control efforts. Despite various preventive strategies, the incidence of CDI remains high, necessitating further exploration of risk factors and targeted interventions.

C difficile infection occurs primarily in individuals with disrupted gut microbiota, and antibiotic exposure is a well-recognized risk factor. Broad-spectrum antibiotics, such as fluoroquinolones, clindamycin, and broad-spectrum cephalosporins, substantially increase CDI risk by altering the gut microbiome and creating conditions favorable for C difficile colonization and proliferation. Moreover, the risk of CDI is influenced by the duration and intensity of antibiotic exposure, with prolonged and multiple courses of antibiotics considered particularly hazardous. Other risk factors include advanced age, comorbidities, proton pump inhibitor use, and prior CDI events.

In addition to these general risk factors, asymptomatic carriers of C difficile, ie, individuals with positive test results for the bacterium without exhibiting symptoms, present unique challenges in health care settings. These carriers not only act as potential reservoirs for transmission but also are at an elevated risk of progressing to clinical CDI. However, the specific interactions among antibiotic use, type, and duration of treatment in this high-risk group remain poorly understood. The aim of our study was to address these knowledge gaps by quantifying the rate of hospital-onset CDI among carriers of C difficile compared with noncarriers and by evaluating the role of antibiotic exposure in shaping this risk.

### Cephalexin [^112Q1b9U]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions

Allergic reactions in the form of rash, urticaria, angioedema, anaphylaxis, erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, or toxic epidermal necrolysis have been reported with the use of cephalexin. Before therapy with cephalexin is instituted, inquire whether the patient has a history of hypersensitivity reactions to cephalexin, cephalosporins, penicillins, or other drugs. Cross-hypersensitivity among beta-lactam antibacterial drugs may occur in up to 10% of patients with a history of penicillin allergy.

If an allergic reaction to cephalexin occurs, discontinue the drug and institute appropriate treatment.

5.2 Clostridium difficile -Associated Diarrhea

Clostridium difficile - associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including cephalexin, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile.

C. difficile produces toxins A and B, which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin-producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents.

If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated.

5.3 Direct Coombs' Test Seroconversion

Positive direct Coombs' tests have been reported during treatment with the cephalosporin antibacterial drugs including cephalexin. Acute intravascular hemolysis induced by cephalexin therapy has been reported. If anemia develops during or after cephalexin therapy, perform a diagnostic work-up for drug-induced hemolytic anemia, discontinue cephalexin and institute appropriate therapy.

5.4 Seizure Potential

Several cephalosporins have been implicated in triggering seizures, particularly in patients with renal impairment when the dosage was not reduced. If seizures occur, discontinue cephalexin. Anticonvulsant therapy can be given if clinically indicated.

INTRODUCTION

As the causative agent of Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI), the bacterium C. difficile is a Gram-positive, anaerobic spore forming pathogen of the gastrointestinal tract. As a toxin-mediated disease, CDI poses a significant burden to patients and healthcare systems globally. CDI causes a wide range of symptoms, ranging from mild self-limiting diarrhoea to life-threatening complications such as pseudomembranous colitis and toxic mega-colon. Antibiotic treatment can fail to fully resolve the primary infection, resulting in the relapse of disease in up to 20% of cases. C. difficile has been listed as an urgent threat by the Centre for Disease Control (CDC, USA) with an estimated 500 000 cases per year and 12 800 deaths with $1B attributable costs in the United States. The economic impact of CDI also represents a significant burden in Europe, with costs to healthcare systems estimated at €3000M per year. Risk factors for the development of primary CDI include age ≥ 65 years, antibiotic use, with increased risk for each extra antibiotic prescribed, and prior hospital admission.

### ACG clinical guidelines: prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of Clostridioides difficile infections [^115rzSJH]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Clostridioides difficile infection occurs when the bacterium produces toxin that causes diarrhea and inflammation of the colon. These guidelines indicate the preferred approach to the management of adults with C. difficile infection and represent the official practice recommendations of the American College of Gastroenterology. The scientific evidence for these guidelines was evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation process. In instances where the evidence was not appropriate for Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation but there was consensus of significant clinical merit, key concept statements were developed using expert consensus. These guidelines are meant to be broadly applicable and should be viewed as the preferred, but not the only, approach to clinical scenarios.

### Clostridium difficile infection: a review of current and emerging therapies [^112MJZgy]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on Clostridioides difficile infection:

- Definition: CDI is an antibiotic-induced infectious diarrheal disease that is associated with significant mortality and morbidity.
- Pathophysiology: The shift in intestinal microbiota induced by repeated antibiotic use facilitates C. difficile colonization in the colon, with production of exotoxins (TcdA and TcdB) that cause colonocyte death.
- Epidemiology: The incidence of CDI is estimated at 1.1–631.8 cases per 100,000 person-years. In patients admitted to the ICU, the incidence of CDI is estimated at 11.1 cases per 1,000 admissions-year (95% CI, 7.2–17.1), while in patients admitted to the internal medicine ward, it is estimated at 10.8 cases per 1,000 admissions-year (95% CI, 3.2–37.1).
- Risk factors: The primary risk factor for CDI is the use of antibiotics, especially clindamycin, fluoroquinolones, certain cephalosporins, and carbapenems, as well as penicillins, macrolides, and sulfonamides. Other risk factors include advanced age, hospitalization, the presence of comorbidities, IBD, immunosuppression, and the use of PPIs.
- Disease course: The resultant loss of intestinal barrier function leads to clinical manifestations of diarrhea, and can progress to pseudomembranous colitis, toxic megacolon, bowel perforation, sepsis, shock, multiple organ failure, and death.
- Prognosis and risk of recurrence: CDI has a mortality of 5% and is associated with a recurrence rate of 20–60%.

Antibiotics to be targeted should be based on the local epidemiology and the C. difficile strains present, and restriction of fluoroquinolones, clindamycin, and cephalosporins (except for surgical antibiotic prophylaxis) should be considered (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence).

Rationale for recommendation — The panel states that the balance of benefits and harms "favors adding bezlotoxumab to SOC antibiotics for patients with a CDI episode and at least 1 risk factor for recurrence (recurrent CDI episode within the last 6 months, age ≥ 65 years, immunocompromised host, and severe CDI on presentation)", and notes it "seems more favorable in patients with multiple risk factors for recurrent CDI and especially in patients with a prior CDI in the last 6 months". The certainty of evidence is described as "moderate overall, but very low in subpopulations at high risk of CDI recurrence".

Introduction

Clostridioides difficile (C. difficile) is a Gram-positive, obligate anaerobic bacterium that is a member of the Firmicutes phylum. Its highly resistant spores survive on surfaces for long periods, rendering it highly transmissible from person to person. This occurs mainly in hospitalization facilities, categorizing C. difficile infection (CDI) as a nosocomial infection. This bacterium can also colonize the gut asymptomatically, potentially leading to a "silent" onward transmission. Symptomatic infection, also called CDI, is characterized by diarrhea, fever, abdominal pain and an increase in the white blood cell count. The major risk factor for CDI is antibiotic administration, which triggers diarrheal diseases, termed antibiotic-associated diarrhea. Although nearly all antimicrobial classes have been associated with CDI, clindamycin, third generation cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones, and penicillins are most commonly implicated.

The gut microbiome plays a central role in CDI. The human body is colonized by a large number of microorganisms, including bacteria, fungi, parasites, and viruses, together termed the human microbiome, whose composition is influenced by several factors, such as diet and host genetics. Opportunistic pathogens are primarily blunted by activation of the immune system. This colonization resistance is altered by antibiotics; bacterial composition, richness, and diversity change (dysbiosis) several days after antibiotic administration, generating a convenient niche for spore germination, proliferation, and toxin production. Indeed, data from human studies have shown that the presence of C. difficile, either as a colonizer or as a pathogen, is associated with reduced microbiota diversity. The various antibiotics families may have differential effects on the gut microbiota, thus varying in their impact on predisposition for CDI. The current study examined the changes in the gut microbiota occurring following antibiotic treatment of patients with CDI.

### Antimicrobial-associated risk factors for Clostridium difficile infection [^111eTaS8]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Antimicrobial therapy plays a central role in the pathogenesis of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI), presumably through disruption of indigenous intestinal microflora, thereby allowing C. difficile to grow and produce toxin. Investigations involving animal models and studies performed in vitro suggest that inhibitory activity against C. difficile and differences in the propensity to stimulate toxin production may also influence the likelihood that particular drugs may cause CDI. Although nearly all antimicrobial classes have been associated with CDI, clindamycin, third-generation cephalosporins, and penicillins have traditionally been considered to harbor the greatest risk. Recent studies have also implicated fluoroquinolones as high-risk agents, a finding that is most likely to be related in part to increasing fluoroquinolone resistance among epidemic strains (i.e., restriction-endonuclease analysis group BI/North American PFGE type 1 strains) and some nonepidemic strains of C. difficile. Restrictions in the use of clindamycin and third-generation cephalosporins have been associated with reductions in CDI. Because use of any antimicrobial has the potential to induce the onset of CDI and disease caused by other health care-associated pathogens, antimicrobial stewardship programs that promote judicious use of antimicrobials are encouraged in concert with environmental and infection control-related efforts.

Asymptomatic carriage is frequent, with the bacterium "present in the stool of approximately 3% of healthy adults" and "up to 50% of those exposed to an inpatient facility may be asymptomatic carriers". Antibiotic exposure and comorbidity are implicated, as "Alterations in the bacterial component of the microbiota, most often due to the use of antibiotics, can lead to ecological changes" and "Higher rates of CDI have been reported in patients after exposure to a prolonged duration of antibiotics including perioperative antibiotics and in patients with underlying comorbid conditions such as IBD or immunosuppression".

### Antibiotic use and the risk of hospital-onset Clostridioides difficile infection [^116VArrJ]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Importance

Clostridioides difficile is a leading cause of health care-associated infections. Understanding the association among C difficile carriage, antibiotic use, and infection hazard is essential for infection prevention.

Objective

To evaluate the hazard of C difficile infection (CDI) among asymptomatic carriers vs noncarriers of C difficile and whether it is associated with antibiotic exposure.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This retrospective cohort study conducted between June 18, 2017, and June 21, 2023, analyzed hospitalizations from Sheba Medical Center in Ramat Gan, Israel, which routinely screens for C difficile in high-risk patients admitted to internal medicine. Adult patients (aged > 18 years) without active CDI at admission were included.

Exposure

Antibiotic exposure during hospitalization, including specific classes.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was the development of CDI, as confirmed by laboratory testing for C difficile. Antibiotic exposure was assessed as a time-varying variable.

Results

The study included 33 756 hospitalizations among 23 001 patients (median [IQR] age, 78 [68–87] years; 52.8% men). C difficile infection occurred in 67 of 1624 hospitalizations (4.1%) with positive screening results and in 47 of 32 132 hospitalizations (0.1%) with negative screening results. A positive C difficile screening result at admission was associated with a high hazard of infection (hazard ratio [HR], 27.5; 95% CI, 18.7–40.3). Antibiotic exposure was associated with an increased hazard for CDI (HR, 1.98; 95% CI, 1.24–3.16). Piperacillin and tazobactam showed the most pronounced hazard for CDI (HR, 2.18; 95% CI, 1.41–3.36). Among asymptomatic carriers, antibiotic exposure was not significantly associated with a further increase in CDI hazard (HR, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.73–1.58).

Conclusions and Relevance

In this cohort study, carriers of C difficile had a substantially higher baseline hazard for hospital-onset CDI. Antibiotic exposure was associated with an increased hazard among noncarriers but was not significantly associated with additional hazard among carriers. These findings suggest that while antibiotic stewardship may reduce CDI risk in noncarriers, additional strategies may be needed for carriers given their elevated baseline risk.

Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) antimicrobial stewardship — evidence overview: fifteen quasi-experimental studies published between 1994 and 2013 were identified, with most considered moderate (n = 13) or low (n = 2) quality and no randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Predominant strategies were formulary restriction (n = 11) or prospective audit and feedback (n = 4), targeting fluoroquinolones (n = 7 studies), cephalosporins (n = 10), clindamycin (n = 5), amoxicillin or amoxicillin-clavulanate (n = 3), and others (n = 1 each), and many studies targeted more than one antibiotic (n = 6). Interventions decreased targeted antibiotic use by 50% to > 90% with a global decrease for all antibiotics in 5/9 studies, and CDI incidence rates decreased 33% to > 90% with post-intervention rates of 0.3–1.2 cases per 10 000 patient days. In patient-level analyses, use of multiple antibiotics (mean number of classes 1.8 vs 1.4 antibiotics) tended not to be an important risk factor in a prospective study (relative risk, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.23–1.81), while cumulative exposure showed adjusted hazard ratios 2.5 (95% CI, 1.6–4.0), 3.3 (95% CI, 2.2–5.2), and 9.6 (95% CI, 6.1–15.1) for 2, 3, or 4 or ≥ 5 antibiotics compared to 1.

Objectives

Recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) poses healthcare challenges and morbidity. Preventing recurrence with prophylactic oral CDI antibiotics lack consensus.

Methods

We used data from the largest healthcare provider in Israel to identify all adults aged 18 years or older diagnosed with a first episode of CDI (Index CDI) between February 2018 and December 2022 and subsequently received a non-CDI antibiotic within 2–8 weeks. Patients who received a concurrent prophylactic CDI antibiotic constituted the CDI prophylaxis group. Multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to examine the association of secondary CDI prophylaxis with CDI recurrence according to the severity of the index CDI (primary objective) and with 4- and 8-week all-cause mortality (secondary objective).

Results

A total of 434 eligible patients were included. Among them, 327 did not receive CDI antibiotic prophylaxis, while 107 did. CDI antibiotic prophylaxis was associated with a significant risk reduction of CDI recurrence with an adjusted HR of 0.51 (95% CI, 0.27–0.97). The magnitude of the association was modified by the severity of the index CDI episode (P for interaction 0.0182). Specifically, the HR for recurrence was 0.163 (95% CI 0.045–0.593) for non-severe CDI, and 1.242 (95% CI 0.524–2.946) for severe CDI. No significant association was found between CDI antibiotic prophylaxis and 4–8 weeks mortality.

Conclusion

Secondary prophylaxis with CDI antibiotics appears to be associated with a reduced risk of recurrence in patients with previous non-severe CDI episode. Further studies are needed to confirm this finding.

Trial enrichment using gut microbiota derived biomarkers by high-risk individuals can improve the feasibility of randomized controlled trials for prevention of Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI). Here, we report in a prospective observational cohort study the incidence of CDI and assess potential clinical characteristics and biomarkers to predict CDI in 1,007 patients ≥ 50 years receiving newly initiated antibiotic treatment with penicillins plus a beta-lactamase inhibitor, 3 rd /4 th generation cephalosporins, carbapenems, fluoroquinolones or clindamycin from 34 European hospitals. The estimated 90-day cumulative incidences of a first CDI episode is 1.9% (95% CI 1.1–3.0). Carbapenem treatment (Hazard Ratio (95% CI): 5.3 (1.7–16.6)), toxigenic C. difficile rectal carriage (10.3 (3.2–33.1)), high intestinal abundance of Enterococcus spp. relative to Ruminococcus spp. (5.4 (2.1–18.7)), and low Shannon alpha diversity index as determined by 16S rRNA gene profiling (9.7 (3.2–29.7)), but not normalized urinary 3-indoxyl sulfate levels, predicts an increased CDI risk.

### Microbiota-based markers predictive of development of Clostridioides difficile infection [^113Qa1T2]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Clostridioides difficile is the most common cause of infectious antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) and is the pathogen responsible for the largest number of healthcare-associated infections world-wide –. C. difficile infection (CDI) is characterized by watery stool accompanied by toxin-mediated inflammation of the bowel where primary risk factors include hospitalization, age, colonization by toxigenic C. difficile, and most importantly, antibiotic exposure where use of fluoroquinolones (FQNs), clindamycin, carbapenems, cephalosporins, and penicillins combined with beta-lactamase inhibitors (PBLs) are associated with increased CDI risk –. However, markers predictive of CDI or AAD development are as yet lacking. Such markers could be utilized to stratify patients into different risk categories and to enrich patient populations for clinical trials assessing preventive measures against or therapeutics for CDI.

Patients suffering from CDI, as well as from other forms of AAD harbor a disrupted intestinal microbiota characterized by reduced diversity and elevated levels of Enterococcus alongside reduced levels of members of the Bacteroidetes phylum, the Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae families, and Prevotella spp. during disease manifestation –. 16S rRNA gene profiling provides a useful method for studying changes in microbial composition. More importantly, it might allow identification of microbial markers predictive of the risk of CDI development. Although the microbial composition at CDI onset has been well-studied, the pre-CDI microbiota remains largely unexplored. To our knowledge, only one prospective study has investigated microbial composition as a potential predictor of CDI. This single-center Canadian study, part of a larger clinical study assessing CDI risk factors, demonstrated that the absence or reduction in Clostridiales, namely members of Clostridiales Incertae Sedis XI, in the intestinal microbiota was associated with an increased risk of CDI. Collateral damage on the microbiota induced by antibiotic treatment has been further shown to result in reduced alpha diversity, as well as an increase in the presence of antibiotic resistance genes, and long-lasting effects ranging from weeks to years depending on the antibiotic –. Several small studies in healthy adults have investigated specific short-term changes induced by antibiotics, often in combination with multiple compounds –. None of these, however, link antibiotic-induced dysbiosis to development of CDI.

### Clostridioides difficile infection in children: the role of infection prevention and antimicrobial stewardship [^115kWmSC]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2021). Medium credibility.

There are 2 primary approaches to prevent Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) in children: prevent transmission and acquisition of the organism and prevent the progression from colonization to disease. The most important interventions to reduce the risk of transmission include contact precautions, hand hygiene, and environmental disinfection. Glove use minimizes contamination of the hands by spores and is associated with reductions in CDI incidence. Hand hygiene with soap and water and disinfection with a sporicidal agent are recommended as the best approaches in hyperendemic settings. Because antibiotic exposure is the most important modifiable risk factor for CDI, antimicrobial stewardship focused on identified high-risk antibiotic classes (including clindamycin, fluoroquinolones, and third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins) is critical to preventing progression from colonization to infection. Despite clear evidence that antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASPs) are associated with reduced CDI rates in adults, data demonstrating the ASP impact on pediatric CDI are lacking.

MDRO colonization or infection 1–12 months before CDI testing significantly increased risk of positive CDI diagnosis (odds ratio 4.71, P = .02 and odds ratio = 5.03, P = .05, respectively) independent of antibiotic use, age, and comorbidity status. MDRO colonization and infection are associated with CDI, most significantly if they precede CDI.

- healthcare-associated CDI

- prior hospitalization in the last 3 months

- use of concomitant antibiotics

- PPIs started during/after CDI diagnosis

### Epidemiology of community-acquired and recurrentinfection [^113GSzbg]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Clostridioides difficile infection is a leading cause of healthcare-associated infections with significant morbidity and mortality. For the past decade, the bulk of infection prevention and epidemiologic surveillance efforts have been directed toward mitigating hospital-acquired C. difficile. However, the incidence of community-associated infection is on the rise. Patients with community-associated C. difficile tend to be younger and have lower mortality rate. Rates of recurrent C. difficile infection overall have decreased in the United States, but future research and public health endeavors are needed to standardize and improve disease detection, stratify risk factors in large-scale population studies, and to identify regional and local variations in strain types, reservoirs and transmission routes to help characterize and combat the changing epidemiology of C. difficile.

### Infection prevention approaches for Clostridioides difficile [^114pUiN1]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

Clostridioides difficile prevention is challenging as spores are highly resilient and transmission sources diverse. Hand hygiene, contact precautions, and environmental decontamination are fundamental infection prevention strategies. Antimicrobial stewardship is highly effective at reducing C difficile risk at both the individual and institutional level. Supplemental control measures such as no-touch disinfection technologies and screening/isolation of carriers are generally reserved for situations in which fundamental control measures prove insufficient. Reducing host vulnerability through immunization, prophylactic antibiotics directed against C difficile, or products that protect/augment the microbiome may offer promise in the future.

### Evolution of clinical guidelines for antimicrobial management ofinfection [^113bv8ST]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) has been an epidemic for many years. Our biggest challenge in treating CDI is preventing recurrence, which is seen in approximately 25% of patients with initial infection and in 40–60% of those with subsequent episodes. Given the major disease burden of this infection, appropriate data-driven treatment remains essential. Clinical treatment guidelines provide an unbiased critical analysis of the literature, integrating the quality of the available data to make recommendations. As CDI has been evolving and more research has become available, the frequency of guideline issue from various global societies has increased, as has the detail of the recommendations to fit more relevant clinical scenarios. In this review, we will discuss clinical guideline recommendations over three time periods: The Initial Guidelines 1995–1997, The Second Wave 2009–2013, and The Modern Era 2014–present. We see the changing recommendations from metronidazole or vancomycin for initial infection during earlier times to preferential treatment with fidaxomicin within the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and Society of Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA) joint guidelines provisional update in late 2020. The recommended treatments for first recurrence were initially with the same antimicrobial as the first episode but have since changed to having multiple options for one or more recurrences. We have also seen the addition of immune boosting treatments, including fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT)/microbiota restoration therapy (MRT) and bezlotoxumab in the more modern recommendations. As the guidelines are evolving with the times, it remains important to understand the differences among them so we can apply this information clinically and optimize patient outcomes.

### Association of household exposure to primary Clostridioides difficile infection with secondary infection in family members [^1157DEBf]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Statistical Analysis

For each enrollment month, we assigned individuals to 1 of 4 outcome groups based on CDI status and family exposure to CDI. Enrollees were defined to have family exposure to CDI if another family member had any CDI diagnosis during the prior 60 days (regardless of where the prior family member's index diagnosis occurred). For patients without CDI, we identified family exposure within 60 days prior to the start of the month. For patients with CDI, we considered exposure in the 60-day period prior to the index CDI diagnosis. Thus, in each enrollment month, enrollees were placed into 1 of 4 categories: (1) CDI and prior family exposure, (2) no CDI and prior family exposure, (3) CDI and no family exposure, and (4) no CDI and no family exposure.

Next, we estimated CDI incidence in nonexposed and exposed groups by comparing monthly counts between groups (1) and (2) or between groups (3) and (4), respectively (Figure). Individuals were excluded from analysis (considered not to be at risk) for the 60 days following their index CDI visit and returned to eligibility in the first full month that occurred 60 days following a prior CDI diagnosis.

Figure.
Study Population by Month of Enrollment

CDI indicates Clostridioides difficile infection.

We used 2 approaches to compare the incidence of CDI in individuals with and without family exposure to CDI. First, we performed a bivariate comparison across multiple confounding factors. Specifically, we compared the incidence rate ratio (IRR) between exposed and nonexposed individuals by age group, sex, prior antibiotic exposure, prior hospitalization, and year. For prior antibiotic exposure, we considered prescriptions filled within 60 days prior to the CDI diagnosis or enrollment month. We created separate categories for high risk of CDI antibiotics (ie, clindamycin, fluoroquinolones, or cephalosporins) vs low risk of CDI antibiotics (ie, penicillins, macrolides, sulfonamides, or trimethoprim), as the antibiotics with a high risk of CDI have been shown to pose the greatest risk for community-associated CDI. For prior hospitalization, we identified prior hospitalizations that occurred within 60 days before the CDI diagnosis (or the start of the enrollment month for enrollees without CDI).

### Epidemiology and risk factors for community associated Clostridioides difficile in children [^111zzqwQ]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To assess which risk factors are associated with community-associated Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) in children.

Study Design

This case control study was a retrospective review of all children 1–17 years of age with stool specimens sent for C difficile testing from January 1, 2012, to December 31, 2016. Cases and controls were children who had C difficile testing performed in the community or first 48 hours of hospital admission and > 12 weeks after hospital discharge, with no prior positive C difficile testing in last 8 weeks, without other identified causes of diarrhea, and with clinical symptoms. Cases had positive confirmatory testing for C difficile. Controls had negative testing for C difficile and were matched to cases 1:1 by age and year of specimen collection.

Results

The overall incidence rate of community-acquired CDI in this cohort was 13.7 per 100 000 children per year. There was a substantial increase in community-acquired CDI from 9.6 per 100 000 children per year in 2012 to a peak of 16.9 per 100 000 children per year in 2015 (Cochran-Armitage test for trend P = .002). The risk factors for community-acquired CDI included non-Hispanic ethnicity; amoxicillin-clavulanate, cephalosporin, and clindamycin use within the previous 12 weeks; a previous positive C difficile test within 6 months; and increased health care visits in the last year.

Conclusions

As rates of community-acquired CDI are increasing, enhanced antibiotic stewardship and recognition of health care disparities may ease the burden of community-acquired CDI.
