## Question

Can nails fall off following a viral illness?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether nails can fall off following a viral illness. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the precise nail diagnosis implied by "nails falling off". Then, I should confirm which viral infections have documented associations with that nail change. Next, I will review the proposed pathophysiology and typical timing after infection. After that, I need to differentiate this entity from related nail findings that can be confused for it. Finally, I should assess how strong the evidence base is and synthesize practical clinical guidance for counseling and follow-up, making sure I anchor claims to the dermatology and infectious disease literature as I go [^111A7xDc] [^117PAw5U].

> Let me first confirm the terminology. "Nails falling off" most accurately corresponds to onychomadesis, which is the complete separation and shedding of the nail plate from the proximal nail matrix due to a temporary arrest of nail growth; this represents the severe end of a spectrum that also includes Beau's lines as a milder, transverse ridge from transient matrix slowdown rather than full arrest [^111A7xDc] [^116mhJxU].

> Next, I should review direct links between viral infections and onychomadesis. Wait, let me verify the best-supported association first: hand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD). Case series and outbreak investigations consistently describe onychomadesis as a late postinfectious sequela of HFMD, including the 2017 Pediatric Emergency Care series and multiple Emerging Infectious Diseases reports from Finland and Spain, with Coxsackievirus A6 and enteroviral co-infections implicated during clusters where nail shedding was common [^1147g4QJ] [^113Saztg] [^1174P2Az].

> I will now examine whether viruses beyond HFMD are implicated. Hold on, I should verify varicella as a trigger; indeed, a Pediatric Dermatology report documented onychomadesis in two sisters after chickenpox, supporting that other systemic viral illnesses can transiently arrest the matrix. Let me also consider "tomato flu", an HFMD-like enteroviral syndrome, which has been reported to result in nail shedding in some cases, further reinforcing a viral link across related enteroviral illnesses [^116U4dwL] [^116rXd2r].

> I need to check the pathophysiological mechanism. The unifying concept is that a systemic inflammatory insult temporarily halts proliferation of rapidly dividing matrix keratinocytes, leading first to Beau's lines with milder stress or to onychomadesis with more profound injury; COVID-19 literature describing stress-related cutaneous adnexal growth arrest and broader dermatology reviews of nail dystrophies converge on this cell-cycle arrest hypothesis, which is biologically plausible for post-viral states [^1154ZUMs] [^116mhJxU].

> Let me verify the timing because that often clinches the diagnosis. The Spanish HFMD investigations describe an average latency of roughly 40 days from acute illness onset to nail shedding, emphasizing that onychomadesis is a delayed, postinfectious event rather than an acute-phase finding; this delay is corroborated by clinical series of HFMD-associated nail changes where shedding appears weeks after the exanthem resolves [^1174P2Az] [^1147g4QJ].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions without weighing evidence strength. Although several reports are case series or outbreak investigations rather than randomized trials, the consistency across geographies, pathogens, and study types, together with a coherent mechanism and reproducible latency, yields a credible causal association; a recent dermatology systematic review also lists infections, including HFMD, among established causes of Beau's lines and onychomadesis, supporting external validity despite variable study quality [^113Saztg] [^117F76zT] [^111A7xDc].

> I should double-check that I am distinguishing onychomadesis from similar but different findings. Hmm, wait a minute — initially I almost called partial detachment "onycholysis", but that would be incorrect here; onycholysis is a distal or partial separation, whereas onychomadesis is complete proximal shedding from matrix arrest. Likewise, Beau's lines are transverse grooves reflecting transient slowdown rather than full shedding; pediatric HFMD reports describe both phenomena and emphasize that these nail dystrophies, though alarming, are self-limited and typically resolve as the nail grows out [^111j8gRE] [^112JL4DW].

> Next, I should review who is most affected. Let me verify the age distribution: HFMD-associated onychomadesis clusters largely involve young children in childcare settings, consistent with HFMD epidemiology. But wait, what if I assume it's only pediatric? That would be too narrow; adults can develop onychomadesis as well during severe systemic illness, as illustrated by a critical-care case with complete nail shedding after a prolonged infectious course, underscoring that the trigger is the intensity of systemic stress rather than age alone [^1174P2Az] [^116PXfPx].

> I need to ensure the clinical implications are clear. The bottom line is yes — nails can fall off after a viral illness, most classically after HFMD, and less commonly after other viral infections such as varicella or HFMD-like enteroviral syndromes; the mechanism is a transient matrix arrest from systemic inflammatory stress, with shedding usually appearing 4–8 weeks later. Management is supportive with reassurance, nail protection, and watchful waiting for regrowth; in pediatric practice, these post-HFMD dystrophies should generally be framed as benign and self-limited, while clinicians should take a brief history probing for a viral illness 1–2 months prior and counsel on HFMD prevention and hygiene during outbreaks [^1147g4QJ] [^112JL4DW] [^117PAw5U].

Yes, nails can fall off following a viral illness, most often as **onychomadesis** (nail shedding) following hand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD) [^117PAw5U] caused by enteroviruses such as coxsackievirus A6/A10 [^113Saztg] or enterovirus 71. This occurs due to **temporary nail matrix arrest** [^111A7xDc] from systemic inflammation or direct viral effects [^116mhJxU], typically appearing 4–8 weeks after illness [^1147g4QJ] and resolving without scarring [^112JL4DW]. Similar shedding has been reported after varicella [^116U4dwL] and COVID-19, and nails usually regrow normally within months [^112JL4DW].

## Viral illnesses associated with nail shedding

Several viral illnesses can cause nail shedding, primarily via **temporary arrest of nail matrix activity** [^111A7xDc]:

| **Viral illness** | **Associated nail shedding** | **Mechanism** |
|-|-|-|
| Hand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD) | Onychomadesis (nail shedding) [^113Saztg] | Temporary nail matrix arrest due to systemic inflammation or direct viral effect [^111A7xDc] [^111Qtomf] |
| Varicella (chickenpox) | Onychomadesis [^116U4dwL] | Temporary nail matrix arrest [^111A7xDc] |
| COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2 infection) | Onychomadesis, Beau's lines | Systemic inflammation, vascular injury, or direct viral effect [^1162qpoB] |

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms

The primary mechanism underlying nail shedding after viral illness is **temporary arrest of nail matrix activity**, resulting in separation of the nail plate from the nail bed (onychomadesis) [^116mhJxU]. This can result from:

- **Systemic inflammation**: Viral infections can trigger a systemic inflammatory response [^1154ZUMs], temporarily disrupting nail matrix function.

- **Direct viral effect**: Some viruses may directly infect or damage the nail matrix [^116mhJxU], causing temporary arrest of nail growth [^113Saztg].

- **Vascular injury**: Viral infections can cause vascular injury or microthrombi, impairing blood supply to the nail matrix and leading to temporary arrest of nail growth [^1162qpoB].

---

## Clinical presentation and timeline

Nail shedding typically appears **several weeks after the initial viral illness** [^111A7xDc], reflecting the time needed for the nail plate to grow out and separate from the nail bed. The clinical presentation includes:

- **Onychomadesis**: Proximal separation of the nail plate from the nail bed, leading to partial or complete nail shedding [^116mhJxU].

- **Beau's lines**: Transverse grooves or depressions in the nail plate, indicating temporary arrest of nail growth [^111A7xDc].

- **Timing**: Nail shedding typically [^112JL4DW] occurs 4–8 weeks after the initial viral illness [^1147g4QJ].

---

## Prognosis and nail regrowth

The prognosis for nail regrowth after viral illness is **generally excellent** [^112JL4DW]; nails usually regrow within several months without permanent damage or scarring [^1147g4QJ]. Supportive care, including gentle nail care and avoidance of trauma, is recommended during the regrowth period.

---

## Preventive measures and treatments

There are **no specific preventive measures** or treatments to prevent nail shedding after viral illness [^117PAw5U]. General supportive care and hygiene can reduce the risk of secondary infections and promote healthy nail regrowth [^111VmDoV]:

- **Hand hygiene**: Regular handwashing to prevent secondary infections [^115i6mhy].

- **Gentle nail care**: Avoiding trauma or aggressive nail care practices [^112eTWej].

- **Supportive care**: Providing reassurance and supportive care during the regrowth period [^111j8gRE].

---

Nail shedding can occur after viral illnesses, particularly HFMD, varicella, and COVID-19, due to **temporary arrest of nail matrix activity** [^111A7xDc]. The prognosis is generally excellent, with normal nail regrowth occurring within several months.

Hand-foot-mouth disease is a viral illness frequently caused by enterovirus and coxsackievirus. Traditionally, this disease initially causes malaise, fever, and rash with vesicles in the mouth, as well as on the hands and feet. Occasionally, more severe presentations and late postinfectious sequelae occur, including onychomadesis, which involves nail matrix arrest. We describe a series of four cases of onychomadesis and its evaluation following recent hand-foot-mouth disease during this enteroviral season as a way to ensure appropriate clinician diagnosis and guidance.

### Telogen effluvium, Beau lines, and acral peeling associated with COVID-19 infection [^1154ZUMs]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

A sudden systemic event, such as a viral illness, can often disrupt the growth of keratinocytes of the skin, germinal follicles of the hair, and keratin of the nails. The pathophysiology of these cutaneous manifestations has not been extensively studied. However, it may be explained by the virus invoking a heightened systemic inflammatory response leading to cell cycle anergy or arrest of rapidly dividing cells.

Telogen effluvium and Beau lines are both cutaneous changes associated with acute stressors. Telogen effluvium is characterized by diffuse hair loss often following a triggering event, such as severe illness, drugs, hormonal changes, or psychosocial stress. The pathophysiology involves the abrupt arrest of the hair cycle, during which large numbers of anagen hair follicles are prematurely triggered to enter the involution phase (catagen) and resting phase (telogen), resulting in sudden hair shedding (exogen), often after showering or during combing. The interval between the inciting event or exposure and the hair loss is usually weeks to months and may continue for 6 months with spontaneous recovery.

Similarly, Beau lines are transverse grooves in the nail plate that result from a temporary arrest of proximal nail matrix proliferation often following local trauma, cutaneous diseases such as hand-foot-mouth disease, or severe febrile illnesses, including previously reported cases of COVID-19 infection. The distance from the proximal nail fold to the leading edge of a Beau line can be used to estimate the approximate elapsed time since the initial inciting factor.

### Leukonychia: What can white nails tell us [^111jcHBD]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2022). Low credibility.

Sometimes, the circumstances in which total apparent leukonychia appears can easily be explained by changes in the nail bed, such as nail bed edema in lymphoedema, paleness of the nail bed in severe anemia, and cicatricial changes after total skin electron beam irradiation therapy. Among other culprits, selenium deficiency has been reported several times. It has been assumed that selenium deficiency may be responsible for apparent leukonychia in vegetarians in selenium-deficient areas, patients undergoing long-term hemodialysis, long-term parenteral nutrition, weight loss, phenylketonuria, malabsorption disorders, and human immunodeficiency virus. Remarkably, selenium deficiency has also been attributed to true leukonychia in Crohn's disease where selenium supplementation was able to induce complete regression.

Partial or total pseudo-leukonychia can instead be caused by onychomycosis, especially proximal subungual, but also by onycholysis. In these instances, scraping is not possible, and differentiation from true leukonychia can be difficult.

With the onset of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, a number of nail unit changes have been associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. We report a new unique nail finding within one month of infection and RT-PCR test positivity, characterized by an abrupt proximal superficial nail plate change characteristic of shoreline nails. The possibility that this nail change may represent a Koebner phenomenon in patients prone to lichen planus is raised.

### Leukonychia: What can white nails tell us [^115mRfS4]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2022). Low credibility.

Newton's theorem states that a surface appears white when it reflects all the radiation of visible light. The nail plate surface in true leukonychia looks white because it reflects visible light in a diffuse way, preventing the visualization of the underlying vascularized nail bed. This is due to an abnormal distal matrix keratinization, resulting in persistent and odd-appearing parakeratosis with disorganized large and globular onychocytes with perinuclear vacuolization and keratohyaline granules in intermediate and ventral nail plates. Under the electron microscope, the keratin fibers are also dissociated, fragmented, and irregularly aligned.

Parakeratosis can be induced by numerous factors damaging the distal nail matrix. Once the trigger stops or is removed (when feasible), the white color starts to grow out. The white color in apparent leukonychia is instead the result of blood vessel compression of the nail bed. Histologically, the white area is considered to be caused by chronic anemia, secondary to increased wall thickness of capillaries, by modification of subungual keratin, or by overgrowth of connective tissue between the nail and the bone with the reduction of blood in the subpapillary plexus. Localized or general edema of the nail bed is one of the possible factors that induces compression and constriction of subungual vasculature and affects the organization of the collagen fibers of the nail bed. The role of edema is also suggested by a higher prevalence of apparent leukonychia in the involved limb in unilateral lymphedema.

The human fingernail contributes to the precise dexterity of the fingers, enhances sensibility, allows manipulation of fine objects, and shields the fingertip from traumatic injury. Nail abnormalities are a common incidental finding in the course of a hand surgeon's daily practice. These abnormalities may be clues to systemic, dermatologic, traumatic, and infectious processes that would benefit from further evaluation and treatment. The purpose of this review is to discuss common nail dystrophies and their related diagnoses.

### How does post COVID differ from other post-viral conditions in childhood and adolescence (0–20 years old)? A systematic review [^113v68ZT]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Low credibility.

Some viral infections are known to cause post-acute infection syndromes and may represent a considerable healthcare burden, with social and economic consequences for children, adolescents, and their families. The clinical presentation is heterogeneous and includes both physical and psychological symptoms, usually without any specific clinical findings or laboratory abnormalities. The features may vary according to the etiology of the viral infection, individual patient response (complete recovery, relapse, or remitting pattern), and age, with younger children being more prone to respiratory symptoms and older children often presenting with chronic fatigue.

It can be argued that post-viral syndromes often share a similar symptom profile, irrespective of the involved pathogen, which suggests the potential existence of a common etiopathogenesis. Post-viral fatigue syndrome, also referred to as myalgic encephalomyelitis or chronic fatigue syndrome, presents symptoms of fatigue, muscle weakness, and variable neurological abnormalities. Many viruses have been thought to be associated with post-acute infection syndromes, most commonly Coxsackie viruses, but also Influenza, Varicella, Epstein–Barr, Ebola, and tick-borne encephalitis viruses. Similarly, SARS-CoV-2 infection may be followed by a comparable post-acute, long-lasting multi-organ syndrome.

The most commonly reported symptoms of long/post-COVID conditions include fatigue, headache, attention disorder, hair loss, cough, chest pain, and dyspnea; however, with a lower prevalence in children to young adults as compared to adults.

Nail degloving refers to the partial or total avulsion of the nail and surrounding tissue (perionychium). It typically appears as a thimble-shaped nail shedding or a partial or total loss of the nail organ with soft tissue. Nail degloving represents the end result of various insults to the nail apparatus, including trauma, dermatologic diseases, and drug reactions.

### Laboratory-acquired dengue virus infection, United States, 2018 [^1165Bede]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2020). Low credibility.

The case-patient reported that small splashes often occurred during virus production and purification. The case-patient did not change gloves when splashes occurred but occasionally performed surface decontamination of gloves and the biological safety cabinet (BSC) with 70% ethanol. The case-patient estimated entering and exiting the BSC 6–8 times per day on most days of the protocol but was not vigilant about handwashing after removing gloves. The case-patient reported taking online Biosafety Level 2 (BSL-2) training upon joining the laboratory, receiving hands-on training for BSL-2 work, and annually reviewing laboratory safety plans and procedures.

The case-patient reported having sustained a compression wound on the ring finger of the left hand on July 9 or 10; the wound later appeared infected and oozing. The case-patient did not bandage or cover this wound before donning a single pair of gloves while working on the protocol for virus production and purification. The case-patient demonstrated their technique for doffing gloves: the base of the glove of the left hand was pinched with the thumb and forefinger of the right hand and the glove removed while turning it inside out, after which the base of the glove on the right hand was pinched with the thumb and forefinger of the now ungloved left hand. The case-patient acknowledged that the wound on the ring finger of the left hand could have contacted the potentially contaminated glove on the right hand. The case-patient also mentioned having potentially touched mucosal surfaces of the nose or mouth with the lab coat sleeve.

Results

- **Studied persons**: Sixty-five fecal samples, collected from 44 onychomadesis case-patients (28 with HFMD) and 21 children who were exposed to onychomadesis case-patients (3 with HFMD), were tested for EVs. Of these, 38 (59%) samples collected from 29 onychomadesis case-patients (23 with HFMD) and 9 exposed persons (1 with HFMD) tested positive. To eliminate likely incidental serotypes not related to onychomadesis, we selected clinical samples from children with sporadic onychomadesis–HFMD using the following tentative exclusion criteria: time between HFMD symptom onset and specimen collection > 90 days and a latency period between the onset for HFMD and the onset for onychomadesis of < 2 weeks, which is considerably shorter than the corresponding average in other onychomadesis outbreaks (≈40 days). As a result, 6 EV-positive samples were excluded from the study.

All 32 children studied (19 boys) were < 5 years of age (mean 2.1, range 1.3–4.2 years). They attended 9 different childcare centers, except for 5 children, 3 of whom were siblings. A cluster of onychomadesis cases during May–July 2008 was first reported in childcare center 1, from which 17 samples from onychomadesis patients and exposed children were studied. By the time the epidemiologic study was conducted in childcare center 1, some sporadic onychomadesis cases were reported in other childcare centers, and EV-positive samples from corresponding case-patients and 1 exposed person were analyzed (childcare centers 2–8). In October 2008, another cluster of HFMD cases was identified in childcare centers.

- **Answers**:
	- A. The incidence of onychomatricoma is greater in men than in women – Incorrect. The approximate gender ratio is 1:1, and it is thought that the tumor has no gender predilection.
	- B. Surgical excision is not recommended – Incorrect. Although no case of malignant transformation has been reported, complete excision of an onychomatricoma is recommended. One case of local recurrence has been reported after an excision.
	- C. Surgical excision, including the removal of the normal nail matrix proximal to the tumor, is the treatment of choice – Correct. Complete excision, as well as surgical removal of the normal nail matrix proximal to the tumor, is recommended to prevent recurrence.
	- D. The lesion is typically painful – Incorrect. Pain with nail compression is only observed in 30% of cases. Inflammation of the proximal nail fold is more commonly observed in long-lasting tumors.
	- E. Onychomatricoma is a tumor of the nail bed – Incorrect. Onychomatricoma is a rare benign tumor arising from the nail matrix.
	- F. Onychomatricoma is exclusively seen in adults – Incorrect. A sporadic pediatric case has been reported in a 4-year-old Pakistani girl.

### Survival of influenza virus on human fingers [^111mJsA7]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2014). Low credibility.

Indirect transmission of the influenza virus via finger contamination with respiratory mucus droplets has been hypothesized to contribute to transmission in the community. Under laboratory conditions, influenza-infected respiratory droplets were reconstituted as close as possible to natural conditions. We investigated experimentally the survival of influenza A (H3N2) and A (H1N1)pdm09 viruses on human fingers. Infectious virus was easily recoverable on all fingers 1 min after fingertip contamination but then decreased very rapidly. After 30 min, infectious virus was detectable in only a small minority of subjects. Infectious viruses were detected for a longer period of time when droplets of larger size containing a higher number of particles were tested or when the viral concentration increased. A rapid decrease in infectiousness was observed when droplet integrity was disrupted. Our findings could help to set up the promotion of hand hygiene to prevent influenza hand contamination.

### Cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19: An evidence-based review [^112DKRgP]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2020). Low credibility.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has affected 18 million people and killed over 690,000 patients. Although this virus primarily causes respiratory symptoms, an increasing number of cutaneous manifestations associated with this disease have been reported.

- **Objective**: The aim of this review was to collate and categorize the dermatologic findings reported in patients with COVID-19 and identify specific lesions that may facilitate diagnosis and prognostication.

- **Methods**: An evidence-based review of the PubMed database was conducted on 14 May 2020, using the search terms "Covid-19 skin", "Covid-19 rash", "Covid-19 exanthem", and "Covid-19 chilblains". Peer-reviewed publications containing original COVID-19 patient cases and a discussion of the associated cutaneous findings were included in the analysis.

- **Results**: The literature search identified 115 records, of which 34 publications describing 996 patients with dermatologic conditions were included. Case reports (n = 15), case series (n = 13), and observational prospective studies (n = 4) were the most common publication types. Acral lesions resembling pseudo-chilblains were the most frequent lesion identified (40.4% of cases), appearing in young adults (mean age, 23.2 years) after the onset of extracutaneous COVID-19 symptoms (55/100 patients). Erythematous maculopapular rashes affected 21.3% of patients, most frequently impacting middle-aged adults (mean age, 53.2 years) and occurring at the same time as non-cutaneous symptoms (110/187 patients). Vesicular rashes affected 13.0% of patients.

### Leukonychia: What can white nails tell us [^11124GiP]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2022). Low credibility.

Different morphological aspects of leukonychia can coexist in the same digit and in different digits of the same patient. Leukonychia is always asymptomatic and can even go unnoticed.

- **Punctate leukonychia**: Punctate true leukonychia is probably the most common clinical presentation of leukonychia, especially in children. Not all nail plates are necessarily affected, and every nail plate may be affected in different ways. The pattern and number of spots may change as the nail grows. It is not related to reduced calcium or iron content of the nail plate, as popularly believed. Usually, it is due to trauma (see Fig. 1) but may also result from inflammatory diseases such as alopecia areata or psoriasis.

Pseudo-leukonychia often presents as punctate leukonychia. Typical causes include superficial white onychomycosis (see Fig. 2) and nail fragility due to nail cosmetics (see Figs. 3, 4). Punctate areas of leukonychia from fungal invasion can eventually coalesce to involve the entire surface of the nail plate or may present with single or multiple transverse leukonychial bands separated by a normal nail plate. Artificial nails and frequent use of polish removers damage the superficial layers of the nail plate, causing dehydration of the nail keratins, which clinically appear as fine and scaling white spots (keratin granulation). The use of cyanoacrylate glue should also be excluded.

Beau's lines can have various causes, including hypopituitarism, critical illness, hypocalcemia, zinc deficiency, nail trauma, and infections such as syphilis, typhoid fever, malaria, scarlet fever, mumps, and measles. Other associated conditions include glomerulonephritis, chronic kidney disease, epilepsy, hypertension, gout, hyperthyroidism, bacterial pneumonia, diabetes mellitus, myocarditis, malnutrition, and Kawasaki disease.

### Unilateral Beau's lines associated with a fingertip crushing injury [^113unGM6]. The Journal of Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

Beau's lines are transverse depressions or ridges on the nail surface resulting from a temporary arrest of nail matrix formation. These lines can be caused by systemic diseases, local trauma, drugs, and infections. Typically, Beau's lines appear only on the affected finger following a fingertip injury, not on the entire extremity. In this report, we present the case of a 36-year-old man who developed transverse ridges in the nail plates of all five fingers on the affected extremity following a crushing injury to the thumb. During follow-up, the growth rate of the affected fingernails was normal. The transverse ridges advanced as the nails grew linearly and eventually disappeared. To the best of our knowledge, no association between unilateral Beau's lines and fingertip injury has been reported in the English literature.

### Two discrete bands of longitudinal melanonychia on one fingernail [^115dAVyN]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

A 52-year-old African-American man with no history of immunosuppression or human papillomavirus infection presented with a 5-month history of a 3.5-mm brown longitudinal band on the medial left fourth digit nail and a 2-month history of a 2-mm brown band on the lateral aspect of the same nail (Fig 1). Hypopigmentation proximal to the lateral nail fold was noted, with a negative Hutchinson sign. He was treated with topical econazole for 1 month without improvement, and a nail fungal culture returned negative. The patient reported no local trauma and had no personal or family history of skin cancer. Two tangential shave biopsies of the nail matrix were performed, one from each band (Fig 2).

Question 1: Given the clinical picture (Fig 1) and histology (Fig 2), which of the following is the best diagnosis?
A. Junctional nevus
B. Squamous cell carcinoma in situ (SCCis)
C. Hemorrhage
D. Melanoma in situ
E. Lentigo

### An irregular black patch on the nail plate [^114bu1Le]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

- **Question 3: What is the best next step in confirming the diagnosis**: What is the best next step in confirming the diagnosis?
	- A. Dermoscopic short-term monitoring alone
	- B. Nail matrix biopsy
	- C. Nail clipping
	- D. Reassurance
	- E. Amputation

- **Answers**:
	- A. **Dermoscopic short-term monitoring alone — Incorrect**: Although monitoring for pigment clearance is important, short-term monitoring with dermoscopy does not confirm the diagnosis of fungal melanonychia. Pigmented onychomycosis requires antifungal treatment to assist with infection clearance, allowing pigment to clear as the nail grows out.

	- B. **Nail matrix biopsy — Incorrect**: If clinical or dermoscopic features were concerning for subungual melanoma, a nail matrix biopsy would be recommended as the best next step. Given the lack of melanoma-specific clinical or dermoscopic features, alternative diagnostic evaluation should be performed first. However, a nail matrix biopsy may be considered for cases refractory to antifungal treatment to rule out subungual melanoma.

	- C. **Nail clipping — Correct**: Nail clipping is the best next step to confirm onychomycosis. Nail clipping in this patient case demonstrated a dystrophic nail plate with subungual parakeratosis and neutrophil collections. Fontana-Masson stain and periodic acid–Schiff stain with diastase revealed numerous fungal organisms that contained melanin, preferentially located on the nail plate surface. However, pigment associated with fungus is often best observed on hematoxylin-eosin staining of a nail clipping.

	- D. **Reassurance — Incorrect**: Reassurance alone without follow-up or treatment would not be appropriate for this patient.

### Pediatric COVID toes and fingers [^116LoFgm]. Clinics in Dermatology (2021). Low credibility.

The emergence of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) worldwide pandemic has been associated with a new constellation of cutaneous features in children. Among the unusual dermatologic presentations are the so-called COVID toes, inflammatory nodules of the feet and toes, sometimes involving the hands and fingers. These lesions mimic acral pernio, also known as chilblains. Unlike adult patients with COVID toes, children are less likely to manifest symptomatic COVID-19.

Although a few studies have found some linkage to COVID-19 through the serum IgA or IgG severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike protein, other studies have demonstrated no such linkage, suggesting that barefoot children in cold weather develop these lesions.

It appears that the chilblain-like lesions related to the period of the COVID-19 pandemic may reflect a brisk immune response, indicating a good prognosis and possibly some form of innate immunity. The possible need to screen for coagulopathy is unclear; however, this has been suggested in one report. Until we fully understand the pattern of immune response to COVID-19, questions may persist regarding how disease manifestations are linked to SARS-CoV-2 exposures.

### Diagnostic value of cutaneous manifestation of SARS-CoV-2 infection [^112ZTicQ]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2021). High credibility.

During the COVID‐19 pandemic, it became clear that the SARS‐CoV‐2 virus, while mainly targeting the lungs, also affected other organs. The first cases of COVID‐19 cutaneous manifestation were documented in China, but the prevalence was very low, at 0.2% in 1,099 hospital cases. Italy then reported that 20% of patients on a COVID‐19 ward (n = 88) had skin clinical signs. Subsequently, other groups have described urticarial rashes, vesicular lesions, and less frequent cases of chilblains affecting fingers or toes (acral rash).

Here, using a population approach, we investigated the diagnostic value of body and acral rashes for SARS‐CoV‐2 infections using data from 336,847 users of the COVID Symptom Study app, and from an independent survey on COVID‐19‐related cutaneous symptoms in 11,544 respondents, 2,328 of whom also shared photographs of their skin complaints.

- **Study summary**: We used data collected through the COVID Symptom Study app to investigate the ability of cutaneous symptoms to identify SARS‐CoV‐2 infection (Phase 1). An independent online survey was used to collect skin-specific symptoms in order to explore their presentation, duration, and timing in relation to other COVID‐19 symptoms, and to collect photographs of skin symptoms (Phase 2). Light-coloured rectangles highlight the data used in the analyses; dark-coloured rectangles represent the observations generated by this study; and the rectangles at the bottom summarize the main findings.

### Beau lines, onychomadesis, and retronychia: A unifying hypothesis [^116mhJxU]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Beau lines, onychomadesis, and retronychia are nail dystrophies with distinctive clinical findings. Trauma has been reported as the initiating factor in each of these entities. Infections, severe medical illnesses, major surgery/anesthesia, medication side effects, and autoimmune disease can produce Beau lines and onychomadesis. This article illustrates the common underlying pathophysiological mechanism that produces each of these nail dystrophies.

### How does post COVID differ from other post-viral conditions in childhood and adolescence (0–20 years old)? A systematic review [^116KwTQU]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). High credibility.

The two studies by Kikkenborg Berg et al. on children aged 0 to 14 years and adolescents aged 15 to 18 years identified a considerable burden of symptoms not only among patients experiencing Long/post COVID but also among seronegative controls. Symptoms of any kind were slightly more frequent in cases, and there was a paradoxical tendency towards better quality-of-life scores related to emotional and social functioning in cases than in controls among older children. The occurrence of symptoms almost as frequently in seronegative children underlines that a temporal association with an event, such as an infection, does not necessarily imply causality.

Alongside the many studies providing insight on subjective symptoms, few studies reported data on objective measures, highlighting the absence of objective functional or structural abnormalities between cases and healthy controls, for example, Knoke et al. Other studies demonstrated immunological differences between patients recovered after acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and those who developed chronic symptoms, such as Di Sante et al, or observed an extended coagulation profile as noted by Di Gennaro et al. Such aspects warrant further in-depth analysis that may help clarify similarities or differences observed in cases and controls.

Similarities between post-viral and post COVID specific symptoms were noted. For example, fatigue, a dominant feature of the post-EBV condition, was also among the most frequently reported symptoms in studies on post COVID, especially in older children and adolescents. Fatigue may be long-lasting, up to several months.

### Bilateral trigger finger in a 7-year-old following a viral infection: case report [^114YJxPy]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Triggering in young children is rare. In this report, we describe spontaneous bilateral ring finger triggering in a 7-year-old boy following a viral infection. The pathology completely resolved without intervention. We propose that the triggering resulted from a viral synovitis. Such a case highlights the importance of eliciting evidence of recent infections in children presenting to hand clinics with finger triggering. It also implies that the transient synovitis often described in children may actually occur symptomatically in tenosynovium as well as articular synovium.

### Leukonychia: What can white nails tell us [^112i6w8B]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2022). Low credibility.

Changes in nail color can provide important clues of underlying systemic and skin disease. In particular, white discoloration (leukonychia) is prevalent, with a wide array of potential relevant causes, ranging from simple manicure habits to life-threatening liver or kidney failure. Therefore, a reliable assessment of the patient with leukonychia is essential.

In the past, two classifications for leukonychia have been presented. The morphological classification categorizes the nail according to the distribution of the white lines: total, partial, transversal, and longitudinal leukonychia. Mees' and Muehrcke's lines are examples of transversal leukonychia, while Terry's and Lindsay's nails are examples of total and partial leukonychia. The anatomical classification categorizes according to the structure responsible for the white color: the nail plate in true leukonychia, the nail bed in apparent leukonychia, and the surface only in pseudoleukonychia.

In this review, both morphological and anatomical features have been combined into an algorithm that enables clinicians to approach leukonychia efficiently and effectively.

Gastrointestinal and respiratory viruses are particularly common during winter months, and reducing the risk of transmission is challenging. The transfer of bacteria from the hands of one person to another is dramatically reduced with a fist bump compared to a handshake. If the same is true for viruses, should we recommend this change in greeting during the winter?

### Hand cleaning with ASH for reducing the spread of viral and bacterial infections: A rapid review [^1124Lq5N]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Low credibility.

Handwashing is important to reduce the spread and transmission of infectious diseases. Ash, the residue from stoves and fires, is a material used for cleaning hands in settings where soap is not widely available. The objective of this review is to assess the benefits and harms of hand cleaning with ash compared with hand cleaning using soap or other materials for reducing the spread of viral and bacterial infections.

On 26 March 2020, we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, WHO Global Index Medicus, and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. We included all types of studies, in any population, that examined hand cleaning with ash compared to hand cleaning with any other material.

Two review authors independently screened titles and full texts, and one review author extracted outcome data and assessed the risk of bias, which another review author double-checked. We used the ROBINS-I tool for observational studies, RoB 2.0 for three interventional studies, and GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. We planned to synthesize data with random-effects meta-analyses. Our prespecified outcome measures were overall mortality, number of cases of infections (as defined in the individual studies), severity of infectious disease, harms (as reported in the individual studies), and adherence.

We included 14 studies described in 19 records using eight different study designs, but only one randomized trial. The studies were primarily conducted in rural settings in low- and lower-middle-income countries.

### Nail regeneration by elongation of the partially destroyed nail bed [^114eZZDw]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

Patients with partially destroyed fingernails tend to hide them, often finding it difficult to seek help, as fingernails are generally considered to have little functional value. To improve the aesthetic appearance of such nails, a simple excision of the destroyed nail matrix can stimulate the growth of the residual healthy matrix and regenerate the nail. The prerequisite for this procedure is a healthy nail residue of at least the lunula. An excision of an en bloc, crescent-shaped, full-thickness scar, measuring 5 mm at its greatest width and extending from one lateral nail fold to the other, can increase the length of the nail plate. Along with the matrix, the nail will grow approximately 4 mm distally. A second crescent-shaped excision, performed 1 to 2 months later, can further lengthen the nail until it has gained full length. Normal nail growth was achieved in 11 patients who had partially scarred nail beds after mycosis or trauma.

Regarding the medical management of onychomycosis, specifically concerning systemic antifungals, the BAD 2014 guidelines recommend offering terbinafine (250 mg/day for 6 weeks for fingernail infections and 12–16 weeks for toenail infections) as first-line therapy for patients with dermatophyte onychomycosis. Baseline liver function tests (LFTs) and a complete blood count (CBC) should be obtained in adult patients with a history of hepatotoxicity or hematological abnormalities.

### An old virus with atypical presentation - Tomato flu [^116rXd2r]. The Lancet Regional Health. Southeast Asia (2022). Low credibility.

Disease transmission and symptoms

The first evidence showed that Tomato Flu (TF), as with Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease (HFMD), is a very contagious disease transmitted by close contact, making children under five years old a particular group at risk. Infants can be infected mainly through nappies or if they touch unclean surfaces or put infected objects directly into their mouths.

The main symptoms of TF are described as high fever, intense arthralgias with sometimes joint swelling, and a rash localized in the mouth (tongue, gums, inside the cheek), palms, and soles. Doctors now report some atypical localization of the lesions; they can also be found on the buttocks or even result in the shedding of nails. The lesions are described as red, painful, growing blisters.

Additional symptoms, like many viral infections, include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dehydration, fatigue, body aches, and influenza-like symptoms. The symptoms may vary in presentation or intensity from one child to another, as illustrated by two cases diagnosed in the United Kingdom a week after returning from a trip to Kerala. The two siblings, a five-year-old boy and a 13-month-old girl, presented a vesicular rash without fever or other systemic symptoms. The girl's rash was more florid, and she developed painful oral lesions two days after, while her brother was in the healing process. After six days, the boy's lesions completely healed without scarring, while his sister had to wait until 16 days for the same result. The Enterovirus PCR was positive for both children, and the EV typing by sequencing showed Coxsackie A-16, another finding in favor of the likelihood of the Tomato Flu diagnosis.

### How does post COVID differ from other post-viral conditions in childhood and adolescence (0–20 years old)? A systematic review [^111AugBC]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). High credibility.

Post Coronavirus disease (COVID) and other post-viral infection syndromes present an overlap of pathogenesis, onset, progression, and symptom profile. We aimed to systematically describe studies on post-viral conditions and determine the entity of post COVID compared to other post-viral conditions in children.

- **Methods**: We conducted a systematic search of the Embase, MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar databases (January 1946 - November 3, 2023), according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The main outcomes were differences in condition duration, symptom type, and development of chronic symptoms. This systematic review was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42023401789).

- **Findings**: Thirty-five out of 5051 studies were included, with a total of 42,934 children, adolescents, and young adults (0–20 years old). Twenty-eight studies focused on post COVID symptoms, followed by five papers on Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) and Rhinovirus, one study on Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV), and one on gastrointestinal viruses. Studies on post COVID mainly reported data on older children and adolescents, describing long-lasting symptoms including fatigue, neurological, cardiorespiratory, musculoskeletal, mental health, and gastrointestinal symptoms. The maximum described symptom duration was eighteen months, with an average follow-up of seven months. The development of chronic symptoms was reported by 30 studies (93.8%) for 10,473 out of 28,474 patients (36.8%). Recovery was achieved in 18,001 out of 28,474 cases (63.2%). The study on EBV reported persistent symptoms.

### Cutaneous signs in SARS-CoV-2 infection: A plea for more rigorous peer review in the time of COVID-19 [^112cZC9n]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2020). Low credibility.

The occurrence of cutaneous signs in SARS-CoV-2 infections has sparked considerable interest in the dermatological community. During the COVID-19 pandemic, numerous reports emerged describing various skin manifestations associated with the virus. However, the need for more rigorous peer review processes has become evident, particularly due to the rapid dissemination of findings without sufficient validation.

- **Classification of cutaneous signs**: Various dermatological symptoms linked to SARS-CoV-2 include maculopapular eruptions, urticarial rashes, and vesicular lesions. These symptoms sometimes overlap with other viral exanthems, making differential diagnosis challenging.

- **Importance of peer review**: The fast-tracking of research publication may lead to misinformation. Hence, maintaining high standards through thorough peer review is essential to ensure the reliability of published data.

The dermatological community urges a more structured approach to publishing to prevent the spread of inaccuracies during health crises, underscoring the vital role of peer-reviewed research in informing clinical practice.

### Characteristics associated with adults remembering to wash hands in multiple situations before and during the COVID-19 pandemic - United States, October 2019 and June 2020 [^111VmDoV]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2020). High credibility.

Washing hands often, especially during times when one is likely to acquire and spread pathogens, is an important measure to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), as well as other pathogens spread by respiratory or fecal-oral transmission. Studies have reported moderate to high levels of self-reported handwashing among adults worldwide during the COVID-19 pandemic; however, little is known about how handwashing behavior among U.S. adults has changed since the start of the pandemic. For this study, survey data from October 2019 (prepandemic) and June 2020 (during pandemic) were compared to assess changes in adults' remembering to wash their hands in six situations.

- **Statistical findings**: Statistically significant increases in reported handwashing were seen in June 2020 compared with October 2019 in four of the six situations. The odds of remembering to wash hands was 2.3 times higher among respondents after coughing, sneezing, or blowing their nose, 2.0 times higher before eating at a restaurant, and 1.7 times higher before eating at home.

- **Demographic insights**: Men, young adults aged 18–24 years, and non-Hispanic White (White) adults were less likely to remember to wash hands in multiple situations.

Strategies to help individuals remember to wash their hands frequently and at important times should be identified and implemented, especially among groups reporting a low prevalence of remembering to wash their hands.

Data from ConsumerStyles fall and summer surveys conducted by Porter Novelli Public Services in October 2019 and June 2020 were analyzed.

### Leukonychia: What can white nails tell us [^1128mo8L]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2022). Low credibility.

Diagnosis of leukonychia is clinical, with the need for an additional test in a minority of cases. The diagnostic algorithm can be a useful tool in most patients by combining both the anatomical and the morphological classification to identify or exclude the most likely causes. Dermoscopy is very useful in integrating the clinical examination by unmasking minor alterations that are not visible or unclear to the naked eye. This technique has become increasingly popular in recent years to facilitate the clinical diagnosis of nail disorders, opening up a valuable second front with the potential to avoid invasive diagnostic methods. Dermoscopy is also valuable in monitoring the evolution of a disease and response to treatment through stored images.

When dealing with leukonychia, besides the morphological aspect that is clearly distinguishable to the naked eye, dermoscopy allows true leukonychia to be better distinguished from apparent leukonychia and pseudoleukonychia. The test of the whitish discoloration of the nail plate that disappears with pressure in cases of apparent leukonychia, but not in true leukonychia, can also be done with the lens of the dermoscope. Moreover, being a color abnormality, leukonychia is better appreciated with an interface solution (ultrasound gel) between the nail plate and the dermoscope lens.

In pseudoleukonychia, due to keratin granulation, dermoscopy should be done without interface solution. Granulation is constituted by scales, which are better visible using the dry technique.

### Double little toenails: Report of 4 familial cases [^115RKGQF]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

The patients did not report any history of trauma to the foot. The older sister had a staphylococcal infection in one of the abnormal toenails. All patients were healthy and had no skeletal, hair, or tooth abnormalities. The proband had been treated for epilepsy and had paroxysmal tachycardia.

The examination showed that these nails, in addition to being small compared with the main nail, were separated from it by a vertical groove that departed from the cuticle up to the hyponychium. These were grayish yellow, and the perionychium appeared normal. Dermoscopy of these nails highlighted a proximal fold, lateral nail fold, and the hyponychium. The size varied between 3 and 6 mm in diameter at the base and 4 and 7 mm long. Moreover, some accessory toenails showed a pattern with transverse bands and grooves reminiscent of staves of a barrel (Fig 2, B).

The superficial texture of accessory toenails was reproduced by a silicone cast technique. Its analysis by scanning electron microscopy showed a shrunken and stumpy nail with a wrinkled surface (Fig 2, C). Ultrasonography of the fifth toe showed two distinct nail plates with two matrices: one main and a smaller connected one located more laterally. The latter, which is the basis of the double little toenail, appears as a hypoechoic area connected by an offshoot or isthmus to the primary nail matrix portion in an intermediate position (Fig 2, D–F). No abnormalities were observed in karyotype analysis. The radiograph of the feet and the distal phalanx did not show any bone abnormalities.

### How does post COVID differ from other post-viral conditions in childhood and adolescence (0–20 years old)? A systematic review [^111VugLj]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Low credibility.

The results of the present systematic review confirm an overlap between post-viral infection symptoms following acute COVID and other viral infections, with some shared clinical features, duration of symptoms, and affected age subgroups. Potential risk factors for post COVID development, such as gender prevalence, socio-economic status, or comorbidities, did not emerge or were not identified with certainty.

Considering our primary outcomes, symptom duration was similar for post COVID and post-EBV/post-gastrointestinal virus syndromes. However, recovery was achieved in more than half of the children with post COVID and post-EBV condition, with a smaller proportion of children developing chronic symptoms. The timing for symptom resolution for post COVID was similar to what has been reported by previously published studies. Nevertheless, post COVID symptoms, in terms of severity and duration, have not been compared to those occurring after other respiratory viruses in the literature.

The underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of post-viral conditions are still unclear, and multiple mechanisms have been proposed: chronic activation of the immune system and the neuro-immuno-endocrinological pillars may be critical points to understanding the complexity of the disease. Viral persistence has also been postulated; however, in most cases, no changes in viral antibody titers can be found, which is not surprising as the symptoms usually appear long after the initial infection. For Long COVID, the possible mechanisms for prolonged symptoms are still under investigation.

### Critical illness onychomadesis [^116PXfPx]. Intensive Care Medicine (2000). Low credibility.

The objective of this case report is to present our observation of the development of a rare nail deformity in the prolonged course of disease of a critically ill patient with a pulmonary abscess.

- **Design**: Case report.
- **Setting**: Tertiary referral, 16-bed, level I surgical ICU in an academic hospital.
- **Patient**: A 48-year-old Caucasian male was treated with penicillin for pneumococcal meningitis and pneumonia. He developed a large pulmonary abscess of the right upper lobe and required prolonged mechanical ventilation. Extensive surgical treatment was eventually successful.

A remarkable feature of this case was the occurrence of onycholysis of all fingernails and toenails, resulting in complete shedding of the nails (onychomadesis). This phenomenon can be regarded as an extreme manifestation of Beau's lines, precipitated by a severe systemic insult.

In conclusion, we observed the development of onychomadesis in a critically ill patient with a large pulmonary abscess. This association has not been described before.

### Hand cleaning with ASH for reducing the spread of viral and bacterial infections: A rapid review [^113WxHzL]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Low credibility.

Contamination of hands with fecal coliform bacteria was used as a surrogate measure for infection.

Four studies evaluated the presence of fecal coliform bacteria on hands using either finger-dip or swab methods (Anuradha 1999; Hoque 1991; Hoque 1995; Khin 1997). The studies exhibited heterogeneous designs, and their results were not synthesized. Hoque 1995 conducted a non-randomized trial, measuring bacterial levels post-defecation handwashing among rural women in Bangladesh. Hoque 1991 conducted a randomized trial, collecting samples from women living in a slum in Bangladesh, with no specific activities linked to sample collection. The women used five different washing materials (water, soap, mud, ash, no handwash) over five days. Anuradha 1999 was a prospective cohort study where Indian mothers' hands were swabbed after using soap, water, ash, or no handwash, just before feeding their babies. Khin 1997 conducted a non-randomized trial involving several soaps and other materials, including ash, on an unknown population in Myanmar.

Quantitative analyses varied across the studies. Hoque 1991 reported the presence of colony-forming units as a dichotomous outcome, while the other studies quantified the number of colony-forming units. Several uncertainties were noted in the results. In Hoque 1995, the number of observations did not align with the reported population of 60 women. In Khin 1997, it was unclear whether the unit of analysis was one hand, one participant, or one group. The report from Hoque 1991 did not specify the numbe… (text truncated or missing).

### Curly fingernails as a potential new nail variant: A report of two cases [^116QtcZf]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Low credibility.

A 40-year-old woman undergoing in vitro fertilization presented with a 30-year history of curly fingernails. She reported keeping her nails long regularly and noted that the curling was less notable when nails were short. She denied family history of similar nails, frequent use of hands for work or hobbies, or toenail involvement. She had a childhood history of right third digit trauma and a history of osteoarthritis. On physical examination, the fingernails were long and curled with minimal onycholysis (Figures 1 and 2). Toenails were normal. Histopathology of fingernail clippings was negative for the presence of hyphae and parakeratosis with neutrophil infiltration, making diagnoses of onychomycosis and nail psoriasis unlikely. Bilateral hand X-rays were negative for psoriatic arthritis. She had curly hair and reported a temporary episode of hair loss coinciding with her in vitro fertilization cycle, which resolved without treatment. At her 2-year follow-up, she reported that her nails remained status quo and that she kept them short to minimize curliness.

- **Figure 1**: A 40-year-old woman patient with curly fingernails of the right hand.
- **Figure 2**: A 40-year-old woman patient with wavy and curly fingernails of the left hand.

A 38-year-old woman, 34 weeks pregnant, presented with curved and wavy nails. She reported that her fingernails began growing curved and wavy at 30 to 31 weeks of pregnancy. She recalled a brief episode of curly nails in the remote past. She complained that the curved areas of the nails were painful, which was relieved by cutting them.

### Local and systemic nail plate abnormalities: A clinical review [^112pKEYW]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2023). Low credibility.

Nail disorders are often difficult to recognize and diagnose because of the subtlety of their presentation and their shared, overlapping features that are common to several conditions. Experientially, this is further complicated by the fact that specific training on the diagnosis of nail pathologies varies substantially across most residency programs and for a majority of medical and surgical specialties. To distinguish these presentations from true, potentially deleterious nail disorders, clinicians should be familiar with the most commonly occurring nail pathologies and their associations, and use a systematic approach when examining or evaluating alterations in the nails. In the present study, we review the most common clinical disorders affecting the nail apparatus.

### Hand-foot-and-mouth disease: Rapid evidence review [^117PAw5U]. American Family Physician (2019). Low credibility.

Hand-foot-and-mouth disease is caused by human enteroviruses and coxsackieviruses. Outbreaks can occur from spring to fall and are common in North America, with most cases occurring in patients younger than 10 years. The disease is transmitted through fecal-oral, oral-oral, and respiratory droplet contact. Patients typically present with a low-grade fever, a maculopapular or papulovesicular rash on the hands and soles of the feet, and painful oral ulcerations. Lesions usually resolve in seven to 10 days; however, in rare cases, patients may experience neurologic or cardiopulmonary complications.

The differential diagnosis for childhood rashes and oral enanthems is broad and includes erythema multiforme, herpes, measles, and varicella. Treatment is supportive, focusing on hydration and pain relief as needed with acetaminophen or ibuprofen. Oral lidocaine is not recommended, and antiviral treatment is not available. The best methods to prevent the spread of hand-foot-and-mouth disease are handwashing and disinfecting potentially contaminated surfaces and fomites.

### Leukonychia: What can white nails tell us [^111HaYtG]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2022). Low credibility.

A reliable assessment of the patient with leukonychia is essential because a wide array of potential relevant causes may be responsible for the abnormal color, ranging from simple manicure habits to life-threatening liver or kidney failure. In this publication, an easy diagnostic algorithm that combines both morphological and anatomical classifications is proposed to assist clinicians in managing this common color abnormality.

### Two discrete bands of longitudinal melanonychia on one fingernail [^116pmWdR]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

Answers:

- **Junctional nevus**: Incorrect. Junctional nevi of the nail matrix can present as longitudinal melanonychia (LM) but usually develop during childhood. A biopsy would show melanocyte nests in the basal layer of the epidermis at the dermoepidermal junction.

- **SCCis**: Correct. LM is an uncommon presentation of nail unit SCCis. Risk factors for nail unit SCCis include radiation exposure, trauma, immunosuppression, and high-risk human papillomavirus infection. The disease typically progresses slowly and can be misdiagnosed as a benign nail injury, bacterial infection, or melanoma. The presence of nail plate splitting, single digit involvement, rapid growth, or heterogeneity can be concerning for malignancy. In our patient, biopsies were taken sampling both the nail matrix and the nail bed of both pigmented bands. Histopathology showed full-thickness keratinocyte atypia without invasion, diagnostic of SCCis (Fig 2). SOX-10 staining was negative for increased melanocytes.

- **Hemorrhage**: Incorrect. Trauma can lead to the accumulation of blood under the nail plate, creating a subungual hematoma. This is generally associated with pain secondary to increased pressure under the nail plate. Histopathology shows erythrocyte extravasation without inflammation.

- **Melanoma in situ**: Incorrect. Nail unit melanoma is a rare cause of LM and is associated with a poor prognosis because of delayed diagnosis. Concerning features include the ABCDEs for melanoma (asymmetry, irregular borders, heterogeneous color, diameter > 6 mm, and evolution) and a positive Hutchinson sign (periungual pigmentation).

### From viral infection to skin affliction: Unveiling mechanisms of cutaneous manifestations in COVID-19 and post-COVID conditions [^1162qpoB]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2025). Low credibility.

COVID-19 skin manifestations are multifaceted, ranging from urticaria, morbilliform or papulovesicular rash, livedoid purpuric lesions, to pseudochilblains (also called COVID toes). Recent insights into the mechanism of these manifestations have highlighted that morbilliform, papulovesicular, and livedoid/purpuric rashes are related to virus-induced endothelial cell damage and linked to moderate-to-severe disease, whereas pseudochilblains are related to an exaggerated IFN-1 production by plasmacytoid dendritic cells in protected individuals.

In this paper, we will review the clinical and physiopathological features of cutaneous COVID-19 manifestations in relation to the direct viral cytopathic effects and dysregulated IFN-1 responses. We will also review the emerging insights into post-COVID conditions (also termed long COVID) and how they may be implicated in the persistence of COVID-19-associated skin diseases.

### Terbinafine [^117GtQHB]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

The efficacy of terbinafine tablets in the treatment of onychomycosis is illustrated by the response of subjects with toenail and/or fingernail infections who participated in three US/Canadian placebo-controlled clinical trials.

- **Clinical studies**: Results of the first toenail trial, as assessed at week 48 (12 weeks of treatment with 36 weeks follow-up after completion of therapy), demonstrated mycological cure, defined as simultaneous occurrence of negative KOH plus negative culture, in 70% of subjects. Fifty-nine percent (59%) of subjects experienced effective treatment (mycological cure plus 0% nail involvement or greater than 5 mm of new unaffected nail growth); 38% of subjects demonstrated mycological cure plus clinical cure (0% nail involvement).

- **Second trial and additional observations**: In a second toenail trial of dermatophytic onychomycosis, in which nondermatophytes were also cultured, similar efficacy against the dermatophytes was demonstrated. The pathogenic role of the nondermatophytes cultured in the presence of dermatophytic onychomycosis has not been established. The clinical significance of this association is unknown.

- **Fingernail trial results**: Results of the fingernail trial, as assessed at week 24 (6 weeks of treatment with 18 weeks follow-up after completion of therapy), demonstrated mycological cure in 79% of subjects, effective treatment in 75% of the subjects, and mycological cure plus clinical cure in 59% of the subjects.

The mean time to overall success was approximately 10 months for the first toenail trial and 4 months for the fingernail trial.

### Leukonychia: What can white nails tell us [^117GE5bs]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2022). Low credibility.

Leukonychia, or white nails, is usually not an alarming sign, but it can sometimes unmask severe systemic disorders or congenital conditions. The white color can be due to nail plate or nail bed abnormalities. Differentiating between these two is essential in the classification and interpretation of leukonychia. The aim of this article is to guide clinical practice by reviewing data concerning several types of leukonychia, with particular reference to all clinical and dermoscopic features, associated medical conditions, pathogenesis, and necessary work-up.

Regarding the medical management of onychomycosis, specifically concerning systemic antifungals, the 2014 BAD guidelines recommend considering fluconazole (150–450 mg/week for 3 months in fingernail infection and at least 6 months in toenail infection) as an alternative for patients unable to tolerate terbinafine or itraconazole. Obtain baseline liver function tests (LFTs) and a complete blood count (CBC). Monitor LFTs in cases of high-dose or prolonged therapy and in patients at risk due to concomitant hepatotoxic drug use.

Concerning specific circumstances for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, particularly for patients receiving organs from HCV-infected donors, the AASLD/IDSA 2020 guidelines recommend including the following elements in the informed consent:

- **Risk of transmission**: From an HCV-viremic donor and, with a public health service-defined increased risk donor, the potential risks for other viral infections

- **Risk of liver disease**: If HCV treatment is not available or treatment is unsuccessful

- **Risk of graft failure**

- **Risk of extrahepatic complications**: Such as HCV-associated renal disease

- **Risk of HCV transmission**: To a partner

- **Benefits**: Specifically, reduced waiting time and possibly lower waiting list mortality

- **Other unknown long-term consequences**: Hepatic and extrahepatic of HCV exposure, even if a cure is attained.

### Leukonychia: What can white nails tell us [^1164k4ez]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2022). Low credibility.

- **Transversal true leukonychia**: Fig. 5 illustrates transversal true leukonychia caused by a traumatic manicure.

- **Trauma-induced transversal true leukonychia**: Fig. 6 highlights matrix damage due to axial pressure on overly long toenails, resulting in trauma-induced transversal true leukonychia.

- **Systemic erythematosus-induced transversal true leukonychia**: Fig. 7 shows this condition as a result of systemic lupus erythematosus.

When the bands of leukonychia fade with pressure, they indicate an apparent form of leukonychia, as shown in Fig. 8. Initially described by Dr. Robert Muehrcke in 1956 in patients with severe and long-standing hypoalbuminemia (< 2.2 g/100 mL), these lines are now considered indicative of various systemic pathologies without hypoalbuminemia, including kidney disease, rheumatoid arthritis, heart transplants, and post-placement of a left ventricular assist device. Systemic retinoids and various cytostatic regimens have also been observed to cause Muehrcke lines. These are paired, narrow, arcuate pale bands parallel to the lunula, affecting all 20 nails and are most prominent on the second, third, and fourth fingernails. They are not permanent and resolve with the normalization of the nail bed, for example, with the normalization of albumin levels.

- **Transversal apparent leukonychia**: Muehrcke's lines are depicted in Fig. 8.

### Imlygic [^112ZhkBJ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

To avoid spreading the IMLYGIC virus to other areas of your body or to your close contacts (such as household members, caregivers, sex partners, or persons sharing the same bed), you should:

- **Avoid direct contact** with your treatment sites, dressings, or body fluids and close contacts. For example, use condoms when engaging in sexual activity and avoid kissing close contacts if either party has an open mouth sore.
- **Wear gloves** when putting on or changing your dressings.
- **Keep treatment sites covered** with airtight and watertight dressings for at least 1 week after each treatment, or longer if the treatment site is weeping or oozing.
- **Replace loose or fallen dressings** right away with a clean dressing.
- **Dispose of used dressings and cleaning materials** by placing them in a sealed plastic bag and throwing them away in the garbage.
- **Avoid touching or scratching** the treatment sites.

Possible side effects of IMLYGIC include tiredness, chills, fever, nausea, flu-like symptoms, and pain at the treatment site. Notify your doctor immediately if you experience any signs and symptoms of a herpes infection, including but not limited to:

### Leukonychia: What can white nails tell us [^1141fJyE]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2022). Low credibility.

Changes in nail color can provide important clues of underlying systemic and skin disease. In particular, white discoloration (leukonychia) has a high prevalence with a wide array of potential relevant causes, from simple manicure habits to life-threatening liver or kidney failure. Therefore, a reliable assessment of the patient with leukonychia is essential.

- **Morphological classification**: The morphological approach classifies the nail according to the distribution of the white lines: total, partial, transversal, and longitudinal leukonychia. Mees' and Muehrcke's lines are examples of transversal leukonychia, while Terry's and Lindsay's nails are examples of total and partial leukonychia.

- **Anatomical classification**: The anatomical approach classifies according to the structure responsible for the white color: the nail plate in true leukonychia, the nail bed in apparent leukonychia, and the surface only in pseudoleukonychia.

In this review, both morphological and anatomical features have been combined in an algorithm that enables clinicians to approach leukonychia efficiently and effectively.

### Enterovirus co-infections and onychomadesis after hand, foot, and mouth disease, Spain, 2008 [^117F76zT]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD), a common disease caused by enteroviruses (EVs), usually affects children. Clustered and sporadic HFMD cases, followed by onychomadesis (nail shedding), occurred during summer and fall 2008 in Valencia, Spain. Fecal samples from onychomadesis patients, who did or did not have previous HFMD, and from healthy children exposed to onychomadesis patients tested positive for EV. The complete viral protein 1 capsid gene sequence was obtained for typing and phylogenetic analysis.

Two EV serotypes, coxsackievirus A10 and coxsackievirus B1 (CVB1), were mainly detected as a monoinfection or co-infection in a childcare center where an onychomadesis outbreak occurred. Based on our results and the detection of CVB1 in two other contemporary onychomadesis outbreaks in childcare centers in Spain, we propose that mixed infection of an EV serotype that causes HFMD, plus the serotype CVB1, could explain the emergence after HFMD of onychomadesis, a rare and late complication.

### Nail plate split of the fifth toenail [^113iyYYN]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Low credibility.

What is the next best step in diagnosis?

A. Nail bed biopsy - Incorrect. Well-developed accessory toenails, as seen in this patient, have no histologic abnormality of the nail matrix or bed. Excision shows all characteristics of a normal fifth toenail: proximal nail fold, matrix, and short nail bed.

B. Nail clipping for hematoxylin and eosin - Incorrect. Similar to answer choice A, there is no histologic abnormality of well-developed accessory toenails.

C. Referral to genetics - Incorrect. Double fifth toenail is thought to be autosomal dominant, but expression is variable. There have been reports that this is common in Han Chinese, but additional reports have shown a broad range of races and ethnicities with this presentation. Double fifth toenail diagnosis alone does not require a genetics evaluation.

D. Radiograph - Correct. In a previous series, 10 patients with clinical findings of a double fifth toenail underwent foot radiographs, with 30% demonstrating a Y-shaped distal phalanx. Other reports have not shown any abnormalities on foot radiographs, but 2 nail plates and 2 matrices were seen on ultrasound. The pathophysiology of the accessory nail is not well understood. There is question of whether the presence of bone in some patients induces nail formation or if the presence of nail epithelium causes underlying mesenchymal cells to generate bone. Our patient underwent radiographs of his feet which did not show any bone abnormalities.

E. Magnetic resonance imaging

### Covid toes: Pernio-like lesions [^113QJ4zY]. Clinics in Dermatology (2021). Low credibility.

More than 40 million people have been infected with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 since the first infection was reported in December 2019 from Wuhan, China. Multiple reports of cutaneous manifestations of the virus have been described, including a pernio-like eruption, recently termed "COVID toes". We have reviewed the published case series on "COVID toes", in addition to studies identifying possible pathogenic mechanisms behind the eruption.

### Life-threatening cutaneous viral diseases [^114s8aJH]. Clinics in Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

Most viral infections present with a cutaneous eruption that, in the majority of cases, is self-healing. Only rarely is the eruption accompanied by constitutional symptoms, and even more rarely, irreversible damage may occur, or death may ensue. As with other infectious diseases, the prognosis depends on the status of immunologic surveillance. Immunodepressed patients are, therefore, at the greatest risk. However, it has become more evident that even in immunocompetent patients, eruptions previously considered benign may, in fact, result in complications and even death.

The introduction of polymerase chain reaction assays has allowed us to attribute certain conditions to specific viral infections, which was not possible in the past. Therefore, dermatologists may encounter patients presenting with skin lesions that may be related to a viral disease and could lead to severe systemic complications. Dermatologists may not be fully prepared for such developments, and thus the goal of this article is to suggest some possibilities. Discussing all viral diseases with cutaneous manifestations would be cumbersome; thus, this article is limited to diseases that may endanger the life of a patient seeking dermatologic advice and who does not initially appear to have severe systemic involvement.

### Nail scissors and fingernails as reservoirs of hepatitis B virus DNA: Role of nail scissors in household transmission of hepatitis B virus [^114xTeKY]. American Journal of Infection Control (2018). High credibility.

No study in the literature has scientifically clarified the transmission of hepatitis B virus (HBV) via personal hygiene tools. We determined the risk of household transmission of HBV via nail scissors. Moreover, we assessed whether nails from HBV-infected people contained HBV and evaluated the correlations of HBV DNA levels in serum, nail specimens, and nail scissors.

- **Methods**: Seventy patients testing positive for the surface antigen of the hepatitis B virus (63 positive for HBV DNA) treated for HBV infection and 27 healthy individuals were included. The real-time polymerase chain reaction method was used to detect HBV DNA levels in sera, nail, and nail scissors.

- **Results**: HBV DNA was detected on 27% of nail scissors and in 50% of nail specimens from 63 serum HBV DNA-positive patients. A serum HBV DNA level > 10⁵ IU/mL was associated with a 71.8% probability of nail scissors being HBV DNA-positive. Serum HBV DNA level > 10⁷ IU/mL was associated with a 71.5% probability of fingernails being HBV DNA-positive (P > .05). Shared use of nail scissors was correlated with surface antigen of the hepatitis B virus positivity and total hepatitis B core antibody/immunoglobulin G positivity. A high HBV DNA level was detected in nail scissors and a low level of HBV DNA in the nails of persons with high serum HBV DNA levels.

- **Conclusions**: Nail scissors, shared use of nail scissors, and duration of shared use play important roles in household transmission of HBV. The level of education within society in this regard should be increased via mass media.

### Terbinafine hydrochloride [^111CSb5S]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The efficacy of terbinafine tablets in the treatment of onychomycosis is demonstrated through responses in subjects with toenail and/or fingernail infections who participated in three US/Canadian placebo-controlled clinical trials.

In the first toenail trial, assessed at week 48 (12 weeks of treatment followed by 36 weeks of follow-up), 70% of subjects achieved a mycological cure, defined as the simultaneous occurrence of a negative KOH test and negative culture. Additionally, 59% of subjects experienced effective treatment, evidenced by mycological cure plus 0% nail involvement or greater than 5mm of new unaffected nail growth. Moreover, 38% of subjects demonstrated both mycological cure and clinical cure, indicated by 0% nail involvement.

In a second toenail trial focused on dermatophytic onychomycosis, where nondermatophytes were also cultured, similar efficacy against dermatophytes was observed. However, the pathogenic role of the nondermatophytes cultured alongside dermatophytic onychomycosis remains unestablished and its clinical significance is unknown.

The fingernail trial, assessed at week 24 (6 weeks of treatment followed by 18 weeks of follow-up), showed a mycological cure in 79% of subjects. Effective treatment was observed in 75% of the subjects, while 59% achieved both mycological and clinical cure.

The mean time to overall success was approximately 10 months for the first toenail trial and 4 months for the fingernail trial.

### Leukonychia: What can white nails tell us [^113Bd67B]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2022). Low credibility.

Congenital partial or total true leukonychia can be idiopathic or inherited. The nails are typically milky, chalky, or porcelain white (Fig. 11). In publications reporting on idiopathic congenital true leukonychia, all patients were male, with only one exception. This sex preference is hard to explain. It could indicate that idiopathic true leukonychia is rather an inherited leukonychia with a recessive X-linked pattern of inheritance, or it could be due to Y-chromosomal inheritance with a variable penetrance.

Hereditary leukonychia may exist as an isolated feature or in association with other cutaneous or systemic pathologies. An autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance is most frequent, but an autosomal recessive pattern has also been reported. A pathogenic mutation in the gene coding for phospholipase C delta-1 (PLCd1) on chromosome 3p22.2, which regulates nail formation downstream of FOXn1, has been identified as relevant in both hereditary autosomal dominant and recessive leukonychia and probably also in leukonychia with sebaceous cysts. Occurring within the context of other pathologies, it has been postulated that congenital familial leukonychia is a symptom of a more complex ectodermal dysplasia involving inconstantly other keratinizing structures and most probably is related to a deficiency of a gene regulating the structure of hard keratin. The 12q13 chromosome encodes the basic and hard keratins responsible for this condition.

### Environmental contamination with rhinovirus and transfer to fingers of healthy individuals by daily life activity [^111954H9]. Journal of Medical Virology (2007). Low credibility.

Rhinovirus infection may be acquired through the inoculation of the virus on fingertips to the conjunctiva or nose (self-inoculation). The virus contaminating the fingertips may originate from hand contact with someone experiencing a cold or from the virus in mucus on environmental surfaces. This study was designed to assess rhinovirus contamination of surfaces by adults with colds and the transfer of rhinovirus from surfaces to fingertips during normal daily activities.

Fifteen adults with natural rhinovirus colds stayed overnight in a local hotel. Ten touched sites in each room were tested for rhinovirus RNA using RT-PCR. The transfer to the fingertips of five subjects was examined by drying 10 microliters of virus-containing mucus from each subject onto light switches, telephone dial buttons, and telephone handsets. After an interval of 1 or 18 hours, the subject flipped the light switch, pressed the button, and held the handset. Fingertip rinses were tested for the virus.

Thirty-five percent of the 150 environmental sites in the rooms were found to be contaminated. Common virus-positive sites included door handles, pens, light switches, TV remote controls, faucets, and telephones. Rhinovirus was transferred from surfaces to fingertips in 18 out of 30 (60%) trials one hour after contamination and in 10 out of 30 (33%) of trials 18 hours (overnight) after contamination. Adults with colds commonly contaminate environmental surfaces with rhinovirus; virus on surfaces can be transferred to a fingertip during normal daily activities.
