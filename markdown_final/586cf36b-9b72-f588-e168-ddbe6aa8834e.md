## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what would happen to the free retained earnings if the reserve for contingencies increases by $10,000, given the current retained earnings structure. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the current components of retained earnings and verify the arithmetic. Then, I should confirm the relationship between total retained earnings, reserves, and free retained earnings. Next, I will calculate the new contingency reserve and the new total reserves after the $10,000 increase. Finally, I will subtract the new total reserves from the unchanged total retained earnings to find the new free retained earnings and select the correct option.

> Let me first confirm the current structure and make sure the numbers add up correctly. Total retained earnings are $95,000, which equals total reserves of $45,000 plus free retained earnings of $50,000, so the baseline reconciliation checks out: $45,000 + $50,000 = $95,000. I should double-check that before proceeding, and yes, it matches the stated total retained earnings.

> Now, I need to think about the effect of increasing the contingency reserve by $10,000. The contingency reserve is currently $25,000, so adding $10,000 makes it $35,000. Wait, let me verify that calculation: $25,000 + $10,000 = $35,000, which is correct. The plant expansion reserve remains unchanged at $20,000, so the new total reserves will be $35,000 + $20,000 = $55,000. Hold on, I should verify that addition as well: $35,000 + $20,000 does equal $55,000, so the new total reserves are $55,000.

> Next, I should review the relationship that determines free retained earnings. Free retained earnings equal total retained earnings minus total reserves. Since total retained earnings are not changing in this scenario, the new free retained earnings will be $95,000 minus the new total reserves of $55,000. Let me calculate that: $95,000 − $55,000 = $40,000. I should confirm that subtraction, and yes, it is correct.

> Therefore, the free retained earnings will decrease from $50,000 to $40,000 when the contingency reserve increases by $10,000. Looking at the answer choices, the correct selection is A. $40,000. I should double-check that I'm mapping to the right letter, and yes, A corresponds to $40,000.

The free retained earnings will decrease by $10,000 to **$40,000** if the reserve for contingencies increases by $10,000, because total retained earnings remain $95,000 and total reserves rise to $55,000. The correct answer is **A. $40,000**.

## Current financial position

| **Item** | **Amount ($)** |
|-|-|
| Reserved for contingencies | 25,000 |
| Reserved for plant expansion | 20,000 |
| Total reserves | 45,000 |
| Free retained earnings | 50,000 |
| Total retained earnings | 95,000 |

## Impact of increasing the reserve for contingencies

When the reserve for contingencies increases by $10,000, the new reserve for contingencies becomes **$35,000**. Total reserves then increase to **$55,000** ($35,000 + $20,000). Because total retained earnings are unchanged at $95,000, the new free retained earnings are **$40,000** ($95,000 − $55,000).

---

## Calculation summary

- **Initial free retained earnings**: $50,000
- **Increase in contingency reserve**: $10,000
- **New free retained earnings**: $50,000 − $10,000 = **$40,000**

---

## Conclusion

The free retained earnings will decrease to **$40,000** if the reserve for contingencies increases by $10,000. The correct answer is **A. $40,000**.

Covariates from the EHR included age (18–34, 35–49, 50–64 [reference group], ≥ 65 years), sex (male = 0, female = 1), race (American Indian or Alaska Native or Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander [grouped due to low sample numbers], Asian, Black, White [reference group], multiracial, missing), and Hispanic ethnicity (yes = 1, no = 0). Race and ethnicity were included because they are known risk factors of type 2 diabetes. Covariates from wage data included a binary indicator for having any reported wage earnings as of the baseline period (October to December 2017) and the amount of quarterly wage earnings reported, in categories ($1-$9999, $10 000-$19 999 [reference group], $20 000-$29 999, $30 000-$39 999, ≥ $40 000). We interacted the binary indicator for no wages as of the first quarter (Q1) with the age category of 65 years or older, as no wage earnings may have a different association with adverse financial outcomes after older adults exit the labor force compared with younger adults. Covariates from credit data included the duration of the exposure period (1–17 quarters) and 16 binary quarter-year indicators for the outcome measure (outcome observed = 1, outcome not observed = 0) to account for changes in policy or macroeconomic conditions over time (Q4 2017 to Q4 2021 [reference category]). Covariates from EHR billing data included ever having a given type of health insurance (private, Medicare, Medicaid, other [Ohio Bureau of Workers Compensation and US Veterans Administration, as well as coverage through the Bureau of Disability, Columbus Free Clinic, drug advocacy programs, and programs supporting people harmed by criminal acts], self-pay) recorded during the exposure period.

### Deep reinforcement learning can promote sustainable human behaviour in a common-pool resource problem [^024564ee]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

To evaluate our RL model, we first chose a space of simple mechanisms, drawn from a continuum along which allocations depend to varying degrees on the level of reciprocation made by each player. These baseline mechanisms expose why the problem is theoretically interesting. At one extreme, the social planner could offer equal resources to recipients irrespective of their past reciprocation. However, this "equal" policy incentivises free riding, as self-interested recipients can rely on others to carry the burden of reciprocation without jeopardising their own relative future receipt. Thus, some argue that unconditional welfare — or a universal basic income — from the state discourages citizens from seeking work. At the other extreme, a social planner could offer recipients investments that are proportional to their past reciprocation, so that self-interested agents are encouraged to reciprocate in expectation of future receipt. However, this "proportional" policy means that trustees receiving less will have reduced capacity to reciprocate, further diminishing their subsequent allocation – and thus locking them into a cycle of ever-diminishing resources. For example, cutting unemployment benefits may itself create circumstances unfavourable to reemployment, such as long-term ill-health, leading to workers being permanently excluded from the labour market.

In this work, our approach to identifying a sustainable allocation policy draws on ideas from game theory and cognitive science as well as AI research. We first collect data from a large group of humans playing a multiplayer trust game. Using machine learning techniques, we build an accurate simulation of human behaviour in the game, populated by neural networks that behave like human players. We then use RL to train an artificial agent to allocate resources to simulated people in a way that should maximise sustainable exchange. We then test the mechanism with real human participants. Surprisingly, the RL social planner identifies a resource allocation mechanism that successfully promotes sustainable behaviour among people, even without endogenous mechanisms that allows them to communicate or self-organise. We then investigate the properties of this mechanism, and build a simple, explainable heuristic that can recreate it, which we find to be equally successful at promoting sustainable behaviour.

### Coverage retention and plan switching following switches from a zero-to a positive-premium plan [^62add4fd]. JAMA Health Forum (2025). High credibility.

Conclusions

We examined how zero-premium silver plan turnover is associated with Marketplace enrollment on the federally-facilitated Marketplace. We found that turnover was associated with reduced automatic reenrollment by roughly 7%, and that it nudged some returning enrollees to select a new plan rather than opting to stay in their previous one. Expiration of the IRA subsidies will likely lead to coverage losses due to price increases; our findings suggest further coverage losses may occur for lower-income enrollees as a result of the administrative burdens created by turnover.

### Coverage retention and plan switching following switches from a zero-to a positive-premium plan [^090767bd]. JAMA Health Forum (2025). High credibility.

We also found that, although turnover was not associated with overall changes in returning enrollees actively selecting their plan, it was associated with a 15–percentage point increase in reenrollees actively switching their plans and a roughly offsetting 13–percentage point decrease in reenrollees actively choosing to stay with the same plan. Independently of changes in premium affordability, these findings suggest that returning, lower-income enrollees may be more likely to switch plans when they are defaulted away from zero-dollar silver plan coverage. Lower-income enrollees, who often have limited access to credit cards and bank accounts, may value avoiding the hassle costs of making a monthly premium payment to their insurer and switch to new zero-premium plans accordingly.

These findings are broadly consistent with prior studies examining turnover in Massachusetts and California. Our analysis generalized these findings to HealthCare.gov, the model platform for Marketplace coverage, as well as the post-ARPA and IRA subsidy regime. Collectively, this expanding body of work continues to demonstrate that the administrative burdens of paying small premiums poses considerable barriers to continuity of coverage for Marketplace enrollees, particularly those with lower incomes. Enhanced Marketplace subsidies are scheduled to expire in 2026. The Congressional Budget Office projected that subsidy reductions will reduce Marketplace enrollment by 2.2 million enrollees, about 9% of total Marketplace enrollment. It is unclear if these projections account for coverage losses due to administrative burdens. Zero-dollar silver plans will largely cease to exist without enhanced subsidies, so zero- to positive-premium silver plan turnover will affect lower-income Marketplace enrollees nationwide unless enhanced subsidies are extended.

### Behavior engineering using quantitative reinforcement learning models [^ab9d4fd0]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

The data presented in the paper were collected in three phases:

Phase 1: In the formal part of the competition, we used the method of Successive Rejects with a confidence level of 95%, and tested 10 of the schedules (0–6, 8–9, and 11, see below) on 941 participants. We found that schedule 0 was the most effective schedule, and schedule 1 was the second most effective schedule. We declared schedule 1 to be the winner of the competition.

Phase 2: After concluding the competition, we decided to test two additional schedules that were not included in the formal part of the competition (schedules 7 and 10). To do that, we ran a pseudo-competition over all 12 schedules using the same Successive Reject method, this time requiring a confidence level of 99%. A higher confidence level entails a larger number of participants per iteration, and a larger number of schedules entails a larger number of iterations. We repeated the process of Successive Rejects for the pseudo-competition. The initial participants used in the earlier iterations were those collected in the formal part of the competition, and when needed, we collected additional participants. We concluded this pseudo-competition with 2633 participants (941 of those collected in the formal competition). The results of the pseudo-competition were similar to those of the competition: schedule 0 was the most effective schedule, followed by schedule 1.

Phase 3: By the end of phase 2, the bias induced by schedules 1–3 was rather similar. We were wondering if by increasing the number of participants, we would be able to better distinguish between them statistically. We added participants to equalize to number of participants per schedule (as before, we allocated more participants than necessary, by a factor of 1.3, because of dropouts). This increased the total number of participants to 3332. The ranking of the schedules was not different from that of Phase 2.

### China's urban EV ultra-fast charging distorts regulated price signals and elevates risk to grid stability [^c50f857d]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Fig. 4
Grid stability risks induced by Ultra-fast Fast Charging System (UFCS) deployment.

a − f Temporal distribution of the probability of exceeding illustrative Regulating Reserve levels in Beijing (a, d), Guangzhou (b, e), and Shanghai (c, f) for 2030 (a − c) and 2035 (d − f). g − i probability of exceeding Capacity Reserve thresholds under different UFCS deployment scales. The thresholds represent the baseline maximum charging load plus an additional reserve margin equivalent to 15% (g), 20% (h), or 25% (i) of the maximum simulated charging load. Points and the error bars on the lines indicate the mean value and standard deviation derived from M = 50 independent simulations for each deployment scale (at intervals of 250 UFCS).

Furthermore, the high-power nature of UFCS places substantial short-term stress on local grid capacity, creating a risk of exceeding the CR. We define the baseline as the maximum simulated public-charging load in a non-UFCS scenario and impose three illustrative reserve buffers-15%, 20%, and 25%-in line with leading planning-reserve guidelines, which all recommend maintaining total reserve margins in the 15−20% range of system peak load. Applying these percentages specifically to the public-charging component allows us to isolate the incremental capacity stress introduced by UFCS. Figure 4 g–i plots, for each city, the probability that the aggregate charging load surpasses the three CR thresholds as UFCS deployment scales up. The results reveal that 15% CR becomes insufficient once 1,000 UFCS are deployed in the 2030 case, as all three cities register a non-negligible chance of reserve exhaustion. 25% CR remains adequate only up to 1,500 UFCS, as beyond that level, approaching the 2035 target of 2,000 stations, the exceedance probability again rises sharply. Consequently, adherence to the current Chinese planning standard of 20% total reserve would leave the grid increasingly exposed between the 1,000 station and 2,000 station milestones, signaling that capacity-reinforcement or alternative flexibility measures will become imperative in the 2030−2035 window.

### Potential smoke-free dividend across local areas in england: a cross-sectional analysis [^74c09551]. Tobacco Control (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Almost all the money spent on tobacco flows directly out of local economies. Expenditure on tobacco also places a significant financial burden on people who smoke, especially those with little disposable income, which is in addition to any loss of income and additional healthcare expenditure caused by the health consequences of smoking. The experience of this financial burden in the population is made more acute because rates of smoking are highest for people in poorer socioeconomic circumstances. For example, in England in 2020, 9.6% of people in managerial and professional occupations smoked tobacco, compared with 24.5% for people in routine and manual occupations. Expenditure on tobacco can directly exacerbate poverty by reducing the resources available to spend on other goods and services. A UK study found that 230 000 households, comprising 400 000 adults and 180 000 children, fell below the poverty line because of tobacco expenditure. Another study has estimated that 135 000 adults with a common mental disorder in the UK would be defined as living in poverty if their income were assessed after their expenditure on tobacco had been subtracted from it. In the face of rapidly rising living costs, there is an increased urgency to highlight the financial burden that tobacco use places on households and communities, and the potential financial dividend to local economies that quitting smoking might bring.

In 2019, the government set an objective for England to be smoke free (defined as achieving smoking rates of 5% or less) by 2030, and in 2022 they commissioned an independent report led by Khan that recommended bold new policies to set the country towards making smoking obsolete. As smoking rates approach the smoke-free target, and then continue to fall to make smoking obsolete (ie, to approach zero), money that would otherwise have been spent on tobacco will be available to people who used to smoke, freeing up household budgets. This additional money might then be used to purchase other goods and services, which are more likely to benefit local economies than money spent on tobacco. The 'smoke-free dividend' to the economy stems from the financial redistribution that occurs when people who smoke quit and hence stop spending money on tobacco. It is specifically the part of tobacco expenditure which currently flows out of the local economy as tax, industry profit and spending on illicit products. When this spending is redistributed to other consumption goods with larger profit margins to local retailers, more of the spending is retained as income locally, rather than leaving the local economy as profit to tobacco corporations or tax to central government.

2.2.3 Subjective Memory

For subjective memory, participants were evaluated on their self‐rating of current memory with the inquiry, "How would you rate your memory at the present time?", "Would you say it is excellent, very good, good, fair, or poor?", which had response options on a scale of 1–5. The response was reverse‐scored so that higher scores indicate better subjective memory at "present‐time". This single item was used to measure subjective memory in studies using the HRS and international population‐based data sets of older adults. Additional supplementary analyses were conducted on two alternate measures for subjective memory. The first assessed self‐report of changes in memory in comparison to the previous 2 years, with the prompt, "Compared to 2 years ago, would you say your memory is better now, about the same, or worse now than it was then?". The other supplementary measure was a subjective memory summary score, which consisted of the primary "present‐time" subjective memory outcome, and the supplementary "2‐year comparison" subjective memory outcome. To create the subjective memory summary score, first, these two items were reverse scored and the "2‐year comparison" variable was rescaled via linear transformation before summing these items for an overall subjective memory summary score.

2.2.4 Covariates

Covariates, which were demographic, socioeconomic, lifestyle, health, and psychosocial work at baseline, as well as time‐varying employment status, were chosen for their relation to cognitive outcomes. Demographic data were age in years, sex (male, female), marital status as (1) "married", (2) "never married", and (3) "other" for separate or divorced, widowed, or unknown; and race as (1) "White or Caucasian", (2) "Black or African American", and (3) "Other". Socioeconomic factors were educational attainment, categorized as (1) "university or more" for participants with 4‐year college, Master's, or professional degrees; (2) "some college" for 2‐year college or some college; and (3) "high school or less" for high school diploma or equivalent, or none. In US dollars (USD), household income brackets were (1) over US$99,999; (2) 45,000–99,999; and (3) < 45,000.

### The exceptional nature of health care as an economic good [^5dc35c51]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Health care reform proposals often differ on the appropriate balance of free market incentives versus government involvement. Often neglected is a basic question: is health care, desirable and scarce, similar to other economic goods? This perspective describes eight characteristics inherent in health care that make it exceptional as an economic good, not only in the USA but also in other rich countries. These are the following: disparity in knowledge between patient and provider; disparity in negotiating power; poorly defined "goods"; insurers acting as purchasers for patients; skewed concentration of expenses across individuals; the magnitude of costs and consequences; limits on the supply of health professionals; and an unavoidable moral dimension. The resulting complexity creates many opportunities to take financial advantage of patients. Even without taking advantage, market forces have predictable consequences, such as denying care to those unable to pay. While excesses traditionally have been constrained by professional ethics, concerns are growing that monetizing medicine has gone too far. Addressing these concerns with greater government involvement brings its own issues, however. Intervention can be inflexible, political, legalistic, costly, and one size fits none. Market forces can also work well when products and services are well defined, information sources are good, purchasers have time to choose carefully, and barriers to entry are modest. Health policy is hard because the right balance between free markets and government involvement is elusive. Anyone advocating changes to markets - one way or the other - must take into account the exceptional nature of health care as an economic good.

### Coverage retention and plan switching following switches from a zero-to a positive-premium plan [^1dfae4fb]. JAMA Health Forum (2025). High credibility.

Importance

Millions of lower-income Health Insurance Marketplace enrollees were defaulted from zero-premium to positive-premium health plans in 2022, 2023, and 2024. This turnover in zero-premium plans may cause coverage losses by creating administrative burdens that complicate enrollees' ability to maintain coverage.

Objective

To determine how turnover affected Marketplace reenrollment.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cross-sectional study used log-linear fixed-effects models including counties in 29 states that used the HealthCare.gov platform from 2022 through 2024.

Exposure

HealthCare.gov enrollees living in a county that experienced turnover that year.

Main Outcomes and Measures

County-year-level counts of overall reenrollment, automatic and active enrollment, and active reenrollment split by whether enrollees stayed with or switched from their previous plan. We controlled for premium affordability, insurer competition, other county characteristics, and state-by-year policy changes.

Results

The sample consisted of 2159 counties representing roughly 10 million HealthCare.gov enrollees annually in 29 states that used the HealthCare.gov platform from 2022 through 2024. The share of enrollees living in counties exposed to turnover increased from 10.3% to 93.9% from 2021 to 2022 as the American Rescue Plan Act subsidies were implemented. These increases have persisted into 2024. Turnover across insurers was associated with a 7.0% (95% CI, -12.7 to -1.3) decrease in automatic reenrollment. Any turnover was not associated with changes in active enrollment, though it was associated with a 13.4% decrease (95% CI, -17.7 to -9.1) in enrollees choosing to stay with their previous, default plan and a roughly equivalent 15.0% increase (95% CI, 11.5–18.5) in enrollees choosing to switch plans.

Conclusions

Turnover affects coverage losses by decreasing automatic, passive reenrollment among lower-income enrollees that may not realize they need to start paying premiums to retain coverage that previously did not have a premium. Turnover also nudges returning enrollees to select new plans rather than selecting their previous plans. This likely increases insurer price competition but also may create hassles for enrollees. These findings suggest that coverage losses from turnover in 2026 among lower-income Marketplace enrollees may be particularly large if enhanced subsidies from the Inflation Reduction Act expire.

Sample Characteristics

The primary sample included 26 240 observations reflecting 170 221 355 beneficiary-years (55.1% [95% CI, 54.1%-56.0%] were female and 44.9% [95% CI, 44.0%-45.9%] were male); 14.0% (95% CI, 13.4%-14.5%) were younger than 65 years, meaning that they received Medicare because of a qualifying disability; 37.7% (95% CI, 36.0%-39.4%) had a high school degree or lower; 14.8% (95% CI, 13.7%-15.8%) had income under 100% of the federal poverty level (FPL); and 32.8% (95% CI, 31.4%-34.1%) had countable assets under $3000 (Table 1). The sample was 1.2% (95% CI, 0.6%-1.7%) American Indian or Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander (data for these groups were merged due to small sample sizes and CMS restrictions on minimum required cell sizes for reporting), 2.8% (95% CI, 2.3%-3.3%) Asian, 11.0% (95% CI, 10.2%-11.9%) Black or African American, 8.3% (95% CI, 7.2%-9.4%) Hispanic, and 85.5% (95% CI, 84.5%-86.5%) White. Just over half the sample (53.5% [95% CI, 52.6%-54.5%]) reported having a difficulty in 1 or more instrumental activities of daily living.

### Projected effects of proposed cuts in federal medicaid expenditures on medicaid enrollment, uninsurance, health care, and health [^e22afd18]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

In January 2025, the Republican majority in the House of Representatives' Budget Committee offered a list of possible spending reductions to offset revenue losses from proposed tax cuts. In May, the Committee advanced a bill incorporating several reductions on the list. The Committee estimated that the 6 largest potential Medicaid cuts (for example, work requirements for some Medicaid enrollees) would each reduce the federal government's Medicaid outlays by at least $100 billion over 10 years. On the basis of the Committee's estimates of savings; Congressional Budget Office analyses; and peer-reviewed studies of the coverage, financial, and health impacts of past Medicaid expansions and contractions, the authors project the likely effects of each option and of the House bill advanced by the Budget Committee in May.

Each option individually would reduce federal Medicaid outlays by between $100 billion and $900 billion over a decade, increase the ranks of the uninsured by between 600000 and 3900000 and the annual number of persons forgoing needed medical care by 129060 to 838890, and result in 651 to 12626 medically preventable deaths annually. Enactment of the House bill advanced in May would increase the number of uninsured persons by 7.6 million and the number of deaths by 16642 annually, according to a mid-range estimate. These figures exclude harms from lowering provider payments and shrinking benefits, as well as possible repercussions from states increasing taxes or shifting expenditures from other needs to make up for shortfalls in federal Medicaid funding.

Policy makers should weigh the likely health and financial harms to patients and providers of reducing Medicaid expenditures against the desirability of tax reductions, which would accrue mostly to wealthy Americans.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) cost/value methodology — U.S. cost-effectiveness thresholds and guideline recommendation are as follows: Empirical updates suggest a cost-effectiveness threshold of $117 000 per QALY, with other demand-side approaches yielding willingness to pay of approximately $142 000 (range: $120 000-$175 000) for 1 QALY based on a per capita disposable income of $60 300, and an alternative US estimate of $95 958 ($81 672-$120 181) per QALY corrected to $112 000 ($96 000-$141 000) per QALY. Given the available evidence, the consensus of the writing committee is to recommend the use of $120 000 per QALY as the cost-effectiveness threshold for clinical guidelines, which should be periodically reexamined, should not be adjusted annually for inflation, and should be revised every 10 years or sooner in case of large shocks to the United States health care economy that cause a substantial shift in health care costs.

### Medical debt and entry of satellite freestanding emergency departments [^914e3797]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Importance

Existing evidence suggests the growth of freestanding emergency departments (EDs) is associated with net increases in health care spending and inefficient use of emergency services; however, empirical research examining how these facilities are associated with patients' financial well-being is lacking.

Objective

To examine whether the entry of hospital-owned satellite freestanding EDs was associated with changes in county-level medical debt in collections.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cross-sectional study examined the association of the entry of hospital-owned satellite freestanding EDs with medical debt between January 1, 2014, and December 31, 2021, using a difference-in-differences design comparing counties with a freestanding ED opening with counties that did not experience an opening (unexposed). The sample was restricted to counties consistently observed in the Urban Institute Credit Bureau Panel between 2011 and 2021; counties with an existing freestanding ED on or before 2014 were excluded from analysis. Data analysis was conducted between August 2024 and April 2025.

Exposure

Entry of freestanding EDs between 2015 and 2021.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The median medical debt in collections (among individuals with medical debt in collections) was the main outcome measure. Freestanding ED entry and medical debt outcomes were measured on the county-year level. County-by-year data on medical debt came from the Urban Institute Credit Bureau Panel, and data on freestanding ED openings came from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Provider of Services File.

Results

The study sample included 1368 counties (48 exposed, 1320 unexposed) observed between 2011 and 2021. The baseline characteristics of exposed and unexposed counties suggested that counties exposed to freestanding EDs, on average, had a larger proportion of younger residents (≤ 17 years, 23.9% vs 22.8%; P = 0.01; ≥ 65 years, 15.0% vs 16.5%; P = 0.007), had a higher median household income ($53 284 vs $46 535; P < .001), and were more likely to be designated as urban (75.0% vs 35.1%; P < .001). Freestanding ED entry was associated with an increase of $98.20 (95% CI, $17.60-$178.81) in county-level median medical debt in collections and a 2.0-percentage point increase (95% CI, 0.7–3.2 percentage points) in the proportion of the population with medical debt in collections.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this cross-sectional study, freestanding ED entry was associated with increased medical debt. Additional research is needed to better understand the mechanisms to aid the development of policies aimed at protecting patients' financial health.

### Humans rationally balance detailed and temporally abstract world models [^91f874e1]. Communications Psychology (2025). Medium credibility.

How do people model the world's dynamics to guide mental simulation and evaluate choices? One prominent approach, the Successor Representation (SR), takes advantage of temporal abstraction of future states: by aggregating trajectory predictions over multiple timesteps, the brain can avoid the costs of iterative, multi-step mental simulation. Human behavior broadly shows signatures of such temporal abstraction, but finer-grained characterization of individuals' strategies and their dynamic adjustment remains an open question. We developed a task to measure SR usage during dynamic, trial-by-trial learning. Using this approach, we find that participants exhibit a mix of SR and model-based learning strategies that varies across individuals. Further, by dynamically manipulating the task contingencies within-subject to favor or disfavor temporal abstraction, we observe evidence of resource-rational reliance on the SR, which decreases when future states are less predictable. Our work adds to a growing body of research showing that the brain arbitrates between approximate decision strategies. The current study extends these ideas from simple habits into usage of more sophisticated approximate predictive models, and demonstrates that individuals dynamically adapt these in response to the predictability of their environment.

### The timescale and direction of influence of a third inferior alternative in human value-learning [^92fda54f]. Communications Psychology (2025). Medium credibility.

Model simulations

The model predictions shown in Fig. 1 were generated using numerical approximations (see Eq. S3). In all models, we used the same value sets: HV = 50, LV = 45, and DV = {0, 7, 13, 20, 27, 33, 40}. The parameters for each model were fixed as follows: Pr: σ_f² = 30.25, DN: σ_f² = 9, k = 100, σ = 50 and w = 1, and RN: σ_f² = 0.25, and w = 1. In Fig. 5 D, E, the parameters to simulate the RB model in equal binary comparison were: σ_f² = 36, τ = 20, k HVvsLV = k HVvsDV = k LVvsDV = 40, and in unequal binary comparison were: σ_f² = 400, τ = 20, k HVvsLV = 60, k HVvsDV = 40, k LVvsDV = 20. In Fig. 5F, we used the same value sets as Fig. 5 D, E: HV = 50, LV = 45, but only two levels of distractors DV = {18, 40} to be able to calculate the distractor effect (Eq. 2) and the parameters were: σ_f² = 100, τ = 20, k HVvsLV = 20–60, k HVvsDV = 20–60, k LVvsDV = 20–60.

Model fitting procedure

We fitted the models by minimizing the negative log-likelihood (NLL) summed over all choice trials (including all ternary and binary trials). For each participant, we fitted each model once on the entire set of choice trials, including both "Feedback" and "No-Feedback" mini-blocks (~1152 choice trials). We optimized the parameters using Matlab's fmincon.m function (MaxFunEvals = 5000; MaxIter = 5000; TolFun = 1e-20; TolX = 1e-20). To avoid local optima, we refitted each model for each participant 10 times using a grid of randomly generated starting values for the free parameters.

### Estimation-uncertainty affects decisions with and without learning opportunities [^007708b1]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Motivated behavior during reinforcement learning is determined by outcome expectations and their estimation-uncertainty (how frequently an option has been sampled), with the latter modulating exploration rates. However, although differences in sampling-rates are inherent to most types of reinforcement learning paradigms that confront highly rewarded options with less rewarded ones, it is unclear whether and how estimation-uncertainty lingers to affect long-term decisions without opportunities to learn or to explore. Here, we show that sampling-rates acquired during a reinforcement learning phase (with feedback) correlate with decision biases in a subsequent test phase (without feedback), independently from outcome expectations. Further, computational model-fits to behavior are improved by estimation-uncertainty, and specifically so for options with smaller sampling-rates/larger estimation-uncertainties. These results are replicated in two additional independent datasets. Our findings highlight that estimation-uncertainty is an important factor to consider when trying to understand human decision making.

Results

Descriptive Analyses

The sample consists of 6471 county-years representing 36.7 million enrollee-years in 2157 unique counties in 29 states from 2022 to 2024. Of those county-years, 4452 experienced any turnover and 211 experienced turnover across insurers, representing 28.4 and 0.8 million enrollee-years, respectively. Roughly 9.6 million enrollees received Marketplace coverage in these counties in 2022 during open enrollment, which increased to 11.5 million in 2023 and 15.9 million in 2024. As shown in Table 1, approximately 75.2% of total Marketplace enrollment from 2022 through 2024 was enrollees from the previous year reenrolling. Among these reenrollees, roughly 28.6% automatically reenrolled in their previous plan and 71.4% actively selected a plan each year — 40.4% staying with their previous plan and 31.0% switching. These percentages were stable over time.

HealthCare.gov Reenrollment by Year, 2022 to 2024 a, b

Table 2 reports 2021 enrollment-weighted mean outcomes overall, by whether counties experienced any turnover, by turnover across insurers, and differences between these groups. Active staying was 5.7–percentage points (95% CI, −7.8 to −3.6) lower in county-years experiencing any turnover — relative to those not experiencing it — and active switching was 8.0–percentage points (95% CI, 4.3–11.7) higher. Counties with 3 or more insurers were significantly more likely to experience turnover, which is indicative of price competition changing which plans are the lowest-premium silver plans.

DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION

The initial dosage of prednisone may vary from 5 mg to 60 mg per day, depending on the specific disease entity being treated. In situations of less severity lower doses will generally suffice, while in selected patients higher initial doses may be required. The initial dosage should be maintained or adjusted until a satisfactory response is noted. If after a reasonable period of time there is a lack of satisfactory clinical response, prednisone should be discontinued and the patient transferred to other appropriate therapy. IT SHOULD BE EMPHASIZED THAT DOSAGE REQUIREMENTS ARE VARIABLE AND MUST BE INDIVIDUALIZED ON THE BASIS OF THE DISEASE UNDER TREATMENT AND THE RESPONSE OF THE PATIENT. After a favorable response is noted, the proper maintenance dosage should be determined by decreasing the initial drug dosage in small decrements at appropriate time intervals until the lowest dosage which will maintain an adequate clinical response is reached. It should be kept in mind that constant monitoring is needed in regard to drug dosage. Included in the situations which may make dosage adjustments necessary are changes in clinical status secondary to remissions or exacerbations in the disease process, the patient's individual drug responsiveness, and the effect of patient exposure to stressful situations not directly related to the disease entity under treatment; in this latter situation, it may be necessary to increase the dosage of prednisone for a period of time consistent with the patient's condition. If after long-term therapy the drug is to be stopped, it recommended that it be withdrawn gradually rather than abruptly.

### Medicare savings program take-up estimates and profile of enrolled and unenrolled individuals [^85085b46]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Importance

Medicare enrollees with low income report challenges affording out-of-pocket costs for health care. Although the Medicare Savings Programs (MSPs) were established to provide financial support, recent patterns in program take-up are understudied.

Objectives

To provide national and state-level estimates of take-up of the MSPs from 2018 to 2020 and describe the profile of enrolled and unenrolled individuals eligible for the MSPs.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cross-sectional analysis used data from the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey (MCBS), a nationally representative survey of community-dwelling Medicare beneficiaries. Respondents from 2018 to 2020 who completed the income and assets questionnaire, which allowed assessment of MSP eligibility, were analyzed. Data were analyzed in July 2024.

Exposures

Eligibility for the MSPs.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The take-up rate of the MSPs, defined as the proportion of eligible beneficiaries enrolled in the program. The MCBS survey weights were applied to create a subsample that was nationally representative of the community-dwelling Medicare population.

Results

The primary sample included 26 240 respondent-year observations, representing 179 221 355 beneficiary-years (14.0% [95% CI, 13.4%-14.5%] of respondents were < 65 years, 55.1% [95% CI, 54.1%-56.0%] were female, and 37.7% [95% CI, 36.0%-39.4%] had a high school education or lower). A total of 20.9% (95% CI, 19.8%-22.0%) of the primary sample was eligible for the MSPs. Of those eligible, 56.7% (95% CI, 54.5%-59.0%) were enrolled. Take-up rates varied widely across states, ranging from 41.5% (95% CI, 25.7%-57.3%) in Ohio to 72.9% (95% CI, 67.6%-78.2%) in California. Take-up among Medicare Advantage beneficiaries was higher than among those in traditional Medicare (61.3% vs 52.9%; difference, 8.4 percentage points [pp] [95% CI, 3.5–13.2 pp]). Compared with eligible beneficiaries who were not enrolled, enrolled individuals had greater economic insecurity, including being 30.0 pp (95% CI, 25.4–34.6 pp) more likely to report income below 100% of the federal poverty level and 16.4 pp (95% CI, 13.2–19.6 pp) more likely to report assets less than $3000.

Conclusions and Relevance

This cross-sectional study of Medicare beneficiaries suggests that MSP take-up remains incomplete and varied across states despite policy efforts. A policy to encourage participation in the MSPs among eligible populations that target less socially and financially vulnerable-although still with low income and eligible for the MSPs-individuals may be more likely to be associated with gains in the MSP take-up.

### 2025 AHA / ACC statement on cost / value methodology in clinical practice guidelines (update from 2014 statement): a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^68cfa501]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Cost-effectiveness thresholds — framework and updates explain that the 2014 ACC/AHA statement provided per–capita GDP–based thresholds such that an intervention with an ICER < $50 000 per QALY gained should be considered high value, $50 000 to < $150 000 (1-3x per capita GDP) per QALY gained should be considered intermediate value, and ≥ $150 000 per QALY gained should be considered low value. The World Health Organization's program suggested that costs less than 3 times the national annual GDP per capita per disability-adjusted life year averted should be considered cost-effective, whereas costs less than 1 times should be considered highly cost-effective; however, experts have argued this approach lacks theoretical justification, and World Health Organization experts now also advise against the use of per capita GDP-based cost effectiveness thresholds and instead suggest considering cost-effectiveness information alongside other contextual information in a transparent multicriterion decision process. The writing committee reviewed alternative approaches, including relying on US-based studies; for example, a health opportunity cost analysis estimated that at 2019 prices, for every $1000000 increase in health care expenditures 1860 persons were projected to become uninsured with 81 QALYs lost due to mortality and 15 QALYs lost due to morbidity, implying a cost-effectiveness threshold of $104 000 per QALY ($51 000 to $209 000 per QALY) in 2019 US dollars, and in the probabilistic analysis 40% of the simulations suggested the threshold was less than $100 000 per QALY.

### Surgery doesn' T pay-but does it matter? Payment by results in the UK national health service [^dc35f342]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Studies show that the main system of hospital reimbursement in the UK National Health Service (NHS), Payment by Results, does not meet the actual costs of surgical procedures, which contributes to hospitals' financial deficit. The resulting local cost cutting measures in turn constrain capacity and quality. This article examines some limitations in analysing Payment by Results in isolation. Although funding might not meet the costs of surgical services, the proportion of overall costs influenced by clinicians is small, because the bulk of costs are fixed. While on one level this seems frustrating, it can also be viewed as liberating; freeing clinicians from the futility of adjusting clinical practice to attempt to balance the books. They should instead correctly focus on quality of care and patient outcomes.

### The translation inhibitors kasugamycin, edeine and GE81112 target distinct steps during 30S initiation complex formation [^a6c8e913]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Translation initiation is the first phase of protein synthesis where the start codon of the mRNA is recognized by the initiator fMet-tRNA fMet and, as such, is a critical step for selecting the correct open reading frame of the mRNA –. In bacteria, translation is facilitated by three conserved initiation factors, IF1, IF2 and IF3, which play essential roles in the efficiency and fidelity of the process. The first step during bacterial translation initiation is the formation of a 30S pre-initiation complex (30S-PIC), which comprises the 30S ribosomal subunit, mRNA, initiator tRNA and all three initiation factors. Upon correct decoding of the start codon by the initiator tRNA, the 30S head shifts from an open to a closed conformation, and the 30S-PIC transitions to a 30S initiation complex (30S-IC). Formation of 30S-IC involves conformational rearrangements that increase the IF3 dissociation rate (or at least the C-terminal domain (CTD) of IF3) from its binding site near the P-site, as well as an affinity increase of IF1, IF2 and the initiator tRNA (refs. –). The dissociation of IF3 relieves a steric hindrance that enables association of the 50S subunit with the 30S-IC, which in turn activates the GTPase activity of IF2. Once the initiator tRNA is accommodated at the peptidyl-transferase center (PTC) of the 50S, IF1 and IF2-GDP dissociate and the 70S-IC becomes elongation competent.

Coroflow findings

The median CFR was 2.8 (IQR: 1.9–3.9), with 113 (110/253; 43%) patients having a CFR < 2.5. The median IMR was 17 (IQR: 12–28), with 72 (72/253; 28%) patients having an IMR ≥ 25. The median transit time at rest was 0.72 (IQR: 0.42–1.12) seconds and the mean transit time with hyperemia was 0.23 (IQR: 0.15–0.39) seconds. These values were 0.54 (IQR: 0.27–1.0) and 0.32 (IQR: 0.18–0.62) seconds, respectively, among patients with CFR < 2.5, and 0.85 (IQR: 0.59–1.25) and 0.19 (IQR: 0.14–0.29) seconds among those with CFR ≥ 2.5.

There were 44 (44/251; 18%) patients with both CFR < 2.5 and IMR ≥ 25, 25 (25/251; 10%) with CFR ≥ 2.5 and IMR ≥ 25, 63 (63/251; 25%) with CFR < 2.5 and IMR < 25, and 119 (119/251; 47%) with CFR ≥ 2.5 and IMR < 25 (Figure 2). The median CFR among patients with an IMR ≥ 25 was 2.1 (IQR: 1.4–2.9), as compared with 3.1 (IQR: 2.1–4.4) among those with IMR < 25 (P < 0.0001).

NHL Study 7

A total of 632 patients age greater than or equal to 60 years with DLBCL (including primary mediastinal B‑cell lymphoma) were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to treatment with CHOP or R-CHOP. Patients received 6 or 8 cycles of CHOP, each cycle lasting 21 days. All patients in the R-CHOP arm received 4 doses of rituximab 375 mg/m² on Days –7 and –3 (prior to Cycle 1) and 48–72 hours prior to Cycles 3 and 5. Patients who received 8 cycles of CHOP also received rituximab prior to Cycle 7. The main outcome measure of the study was progression‑free survival, defined as the time from randomization to the first of progression, relapse, or death. Responding patients underwent a second randomization to receive rituximab or no further therapy.

Among all enrolled patients, 62% had centrally confirmed DLBCL histology, 73% had Stage III–IV disease, 56% had IPI scores greater than or equal to 2, 86% had ECOG performance status of less than 2, 57% had elevated LDH levels, and 30% had two or more extranodal disease sites involved. Efficacy results are presented in Table 10. These results reflect a statistical approach which allows for an evaluation of rituximab administered in the induction setting that excludes any potential impact of rituximab given after the second randomization.

Analysis of results after the second randomization in NHL Study 7 demonstrates that for patients randomized to R-CHOP, additional rituximab exposure beyond induction was not associated with further improvements in progression-free survival or overall survival.

NHL Study 8

A total of 399 patients with DLBCL, age greater than or equal to 60 years, were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive CHOP or R-CHOP. All patients received up to eight 3-week cycles of CHOP induction; patients in the R-CHOP arm received rituximab 375 mg/m² on Day 1 of each cycle. The main outcome measure of the study was event-free survival, defined as the time from randomization to relapse, progression, change in therapy, or death from any cause. Among all enrolled patients, 80% had Stage III or IV disease, 60% of patients had an age-adjusted IPI greater than or equal to 2, 80% had ECOG performance status scores less than 2, 66% had elevated LDH levels, and 52% had extranodal involvement in at least two sites. Efficacy results are presented in Table 10.

NHL Study 4

A total of 322 patients with previously untreated follicular NHL were randomized (1:1) to receive up to eight 3-week cycles of CVP chemotherapy alone (CVP) or in combination with rituximab 375 mg/m² on Day 1 of each cycle (R-CVP) in an open-label, multicenter study. The main outcome measure of the study was progression-free survival (PFS) defined as the time from randomization to the first of progression, relapse, or death.

Twenty-six percent of the study population was > 60 years of age, 99% had Stage III or IV disease, and 50% had an International Prognostic Index (IPI) score greater than or equal to 2. The results for PFS as determined by a blinded, independent assessment of progression are presented in Table 10. The point estimates may be influenced by the presence of informative censoring. The PFS results based on investigator assessment of progression were similar to those obtained by the independent review assessment.

NHL Study 5

An open-label, multicenter, randomized (1:1) study was conducted in 1,018 patients with previously untreated follicular NHL who achieved a response (CR or PR) to rituximab in combination with chemotherapy. Patients were randomized to rituximab as single-agent maintenance therapy, 375 mg/m² every 8 weeks for up to 12 doses or to observation. Rituximab was initiated at 8 weeks following completion of chemotherapy. The main outcome measure of the study was progression-free survival (PFS), defined as the time from randomization in the maintenance/observation phase to progression, relapse, or death, as determined by independent review.

Of the randomized patients, 40% were greater than or equal to 60 years of age, 70% had Stage IV disease, 96% had ECOG performance status (PS) 0–1, and 42% had FLIPI scores of 3–5. Prior to randomization to maintenance therapy, patients had received R-CHOP (75%), R-CVP (22%), or R-FCM (3%); 71% had a complete or unconfirmed complete response and 28% had a partial response.

PFS was longer in patients randomized to rituximab as single agent maintenance therapy (HR: 0.54, 95% CI: 0.42, 0.70; see Figure 1). The PFS results based on investigator assessment of progression were similar to those obtained by the independent review assessment.

### On the way to diploidization and unexpected ploidy in the grass sporobolus section spartina mesopolyploids [^16626b7f]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Plant history is characterized by cyclical whole genome duplication and diploidization with important biological and ecological consequences. Here, we explore the genome history of two related iconic polyploid grasses (Sporobolus alterniflorus and S. maritimus), involved in a well-known example of neopolyploid speciation. We report particular genome dynamics where an ancestral Sporobolus genome (n = 2x = 20) duplicated 9.6–24.4 million years ago (MYA), which was followed by descending dysploidy resulting in a genome with an unexpected base chromosome number (n = 15). This diploidized genome duplicated again 2.1–6.2 MYA to form a tetraploid lineage (2n = 4x = 60), thus reshuffling the ploidy of these species previously thought hexaploids. We also elucidate the mechanism accompanying the speciation between S. maritimus (2n = 60) and S. alterniflorus (2n = 62), resulting from chromosome restructuring, and identify key adaptive genes in the corresponding regions. This represents critical findings to decipher molecular mechanisms underlying species expansion, adaptation to environmental challenge and invasiveness.

### 2025 AHA / ACC statement on cost / value methodology in clinical practice guidelines (update from 2014 statement): a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^63fa1003]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Cost-effectiveness thresholds for cardiovascular cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs) — The 2014 ACC/AHA cost-value methodology statement provided thresholds to identify high-, intermediate-, and low-value care based on U.S. per capita gross domestic product, and the writing committee determined that an intervention with an ICER < $50 000 per QALY gained should be considered high value, $50 000 to < $150 000 (1–3× per capita GDP) per QALY gained should be considered intermediate value, and ≥ $150 000 per QALY gained should be considered low value. WHO-origin GDP benchmarks suggested an intervention that costs less than 3 times the national annual GDP per capita per disability-adjusted life year averted should be considered cost-effective and that costs less than 1 times should be considered highly cost-effective, but critics note they "set such a low bar for cost effectiveness that very few interventions with evidence of efficacy can be ruled out"; WHO experts now also advise against per capita GDP-based thresholds and suggest considering cost-effectiveness alongside other contextual information in a transparent multicomponent decision process. Reflecting these concerns, the writing committee reviewed alternative approaches to incorporating CEA results into guidelines, including relying on US-based studies for identifying a cost-effectiveness threshold or thresholds for cardiovascular CEAs, and Vanness et al used a health opportunity cost approach estimating that for every $1 000 000 increase in health care expenditures, 1869 persons become uninsured, resulting in 81 QALYs lost due to mortality and 15 QALYs lost due to morbidity, implying a cost-effectiveness threshold of $104 000 per QALY ($51 000 to $209 000 per QALY) in 2019 US dollars; in the probabilistic analysis, 40% of the simulations suggested the threshold was less than $100 000 per QALY.

### RNA-peptide interactions tune the ribozyme activity within coacervate microdroplet dispersions [^171689bd]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Membrane-free complex coacervate microdroplets are compelling models for primitive compartmentalisation with the ability to form from biological molecules. However, understanding how molecular interactions can influence physicochemical properties and catalytic activity of membrane-free compartments is still in its infancy. This is important for defining the function of membrane-free compartments during the origin of life as well as in modern biology. Here, we use RNA-peptide coacervate microdroplets prepared with prebiotically relevant amino acids and a minimal hammerhead ribozyme. This is a model system to probe the relationship between coacervate composition, its properties and ribozyme activity. We show that ribozyme catalytic activity is inhibited within the coacervate compared to buffer solution, whilst variations in peptide sequence can modulate rates and yield of the ribozyme within the coacervate droplet by up to 15-fold. The apparent ribozyme rate constant is anti-correlated with its concentration and correlated to its diffusion coefficient within the coacervates. Our results provide a relationship between the physicochemical properties of the coacervate microenvironment and the catalytic activity of the ribozyme where membrane-free compartments could provide a selection pressure to drive molecular evolution on prebiotic earth.

### Fluoxetine [^221a57f6]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.2 Obsessive Compulsive Disorder

Initial Treatment

Adult — Initiate fluoxetine 20 mg/day, orally in the morning. Consider a dose increase after several weeks if insufficient clinical improvement is observed. The full therapeutic effect may be delayed until 5 weeks of treatment or longer. Administer doses above 20 mg/day once daily in the morning or twice daily (i.e., morning and noon). A dose range of 20 to 60 mg/day is recommended; however, doses of up to 80 mg/day have been well tolerated in open studies of OCD. The maximum fluoxetine dose should not exceed 80 mg/day.

In the controlled clinical trials of fluoxetine supporting its effectiveness in the treatment of OCD, patients were administered fixed daily doses of 20, 40, or 60 mg of fluoxetine or placebo [see Clinical Studies (14.2)]. In one of these studies, no dose-response relationship for effectiveness was demonstrated.

Pediatric (children and adolescents) — In adolescents and higher weight children, initiate treatment with a dose of 10 mg/day. After 2 weeks, increase the dose to 20 mg/day. Consider additional dose increases after several more weeks if insufficient clinical improvement is observed. A dose range of 20 to 60 mg/day is recommended.

In lower weight children, initiate treatment with a dose of 10 mg/day. Consider additional dose increases after several more weeks if insufficient clinical improvement is observed. A dose range of 20 to 30 mg/day is recommended. Experience with daily doses greater than 20 mg is very minimal, and there is no experience with doses greater than 60 mg.

In the controlled clinical trial of fluoxetine supporting its effectiveness in the treatment of OCD, patients were administered fluoxetine doses in the range of 10 to 60 mg/day [see Clinical Studies (14.2)].

Periodically reassess to determine the need for treatment.

2.3 Bulimia Nervosa

Initial Treatment — Administer fluoxetine 60 mg/day in the morning. For some patients it may be advisable to titrate up to this target dose over several days. Fluoxetine doses above 60 mg/day have not been systematically studied in patients with bulimia. In the controlled clinical trials of fluoxetine supporting its effectiveness in the treatment of Bulimia Nervosa, patients were administered fixed daily fluoxetine doses of 20 or 60 mg, or placebo [see Clinical Studies (14.3)]. Only the 60 mg dose was statistically significantly superior to placebo in reducing the frequency of binge-eating and vomiting.

Periodically reassess to determine the need for maintenance treatment.

### Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^0c958057]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on heart failure with preserved ejection fraction:

- **Definition**: HFpEF is HF in which the LVEF is ≥ 50% at the time of diagnosis and there is objective evidence of elevated left heart filling pressures either at rest or with exertion.
- **Pathophysiology**: Multiple organ systems contribute. Cardiac abnormalities include impaired LV relaxation, increased LV stiffness, subtle reductions in systolic reserve, myocardial fibrosis, coronary microvascular dysfunction, LA enlargement, and changes in pericardial constraint. Pulmonary and right heart changes include postcapillary pulmonary hypertension, small vessel remodeling, and RV dysfunction in many patients. The arterial system commonly shows increased arterial stiffness and impaired microvascular function. Systemic contributors include obesity, insulin resistance, chronic low grade inflammation, reduced skeletal muscle mass and function, kidney dysfunction with impaired sodium handling, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Several proposed biological pathways link comorbid conditions to myocardial and vascular changes, and greater heterogeneity among patients implies that distinct mechanistic subgroups exist.
- **Epidemiology**: About 3 million people in the US and up to 32 million people worldwide have this condition. It represents roughly half of all people diagnosed with HF. Incidence estimates vary by cohort and time period but are generally about 1–4 new cases per 1,000 person-years. Major risk factors include older age, high BP, obesity, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and coronary artery disease. Women are overrepresented among patients diagnosed in many observational series, although adjusted incidence differences by sex are small in some cohort studies.
- **Disease course**: Presentation is heterogeneous. About two thirds of patients present with overt congestion and volume overload, with signs such as peripheral edema, elevated jugular venous pressure, pulmonary congestion on chest imaging, and resting echocardiographic indicators of high filling pressure. About one third present with exertional dyspnea without clear resting evidence of congestion; many of these patients demonstrate elevated left heart filling pressures only during exercise testing. Common comorbidities that affect presentation and trajectory include AF, chronic lung disease, anemia, obesity, and frailty. Episodes of acute decompensation are common and may be precipitated by uncontrolled BP, rapid AF, infection, anemia, medication nonadherence, or other physiologic stressors.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Clinical outcomes are substantial. Patients with this syndrome are hospitalized about 1.4 times per year on average. Annual mortality in observational cohorts is approximately 15%, with higher mortality in older patients. After a hospitalization for HF, 5-year rehospitalization rates approach 80 percent and five-year mortality ranges from about 50% to 75% in many series. Patients who have abnormal filling pressures only with exercise nonetheless have higher risks of hospitalization or death than people without elevated exercise pressures.

### Standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^3bdbc25f]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for obesity, more specifically with respect to patients with diabetes mellitus (post-bariatric care), ADA 2025 guidelines recommend to obtain clinical evaluation to exclude other potential disorders contributing to hypoglycemia in patients with suspected post-metabolic surgery hypoglycemia, and provide education, medical nutrition therapy with a registered dietitian nutritionist experienced in post-metabolic surgery hypoglycemia, and medication treatment as needed.
Obtain continuous glucose monitoring to improve safety.

### Triazolam [^59f91090]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

WARNING: RISKS FROM CONCOMITANT USE WITH OPIOIDS; ABUSE, MISUSE, AND ADDICTION; and DEPENDENCE AND WITHDRAWAL REACTIONS

Concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. Follow patients for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Drug Interactions (7.1)].
The use of benzodiazepines, including triazolam, exposes users to risks of abuse, misuse, and addiction, which can lead to overdose or death. Abuse and misuse of benzodiazepines commonly involve concomitant use of other medications, alcohol, and/or illicit substances, which is associated with an increased frequency of serious adverse outcomes. Before prescribing triazolam and throughout treatment, assess each patient's risk for abuse, misuse, and addiction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].
The continued use of benzodiazepines, including triazolam, may lead to clinically significant physical dependence. The risks of dependence and withdrawal increase with longer treatment duration and higher daily dose. Abrupt discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of triazolam after continued use may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, which can be life-threatening. To reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, use a gradual taper to discontinue triazolam or reduce the dosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

### Infants in control-evidence for agency in 6-to 10-months-old infants in a gaze-contingent eye tracking paradigm [^ba0a0717]. Child Development (2025). Medium credibility.

3 Discussion

The ability to control one's movement is a core characteristic of agency. This is what differentiates what merely happens to a person from what they make happen. A marker of agentic control is the ability to flexibly adapt one's actions to changing circumstances. To investigate whether infants possess such control and how agentic control develops between 6 and 10 months, we tested infants' ability to flexibly control their eye movements in an eye tracking experiment where they were able to scratch free different images underlying a unicolored surface with their gaze. We found that infants flexibly adapted their eye movements depending on where they could reveal most information from the underlying image.

Infants were first presented with the images in a baseline phase, which established that infants indeed looked more at objects depicted in some corners of the image than at the background. In the following contingent phase, infants could scratch free the images with their gaze. Despite no longer seeing the objects, infants looked more at the quadrants containing objects in the underlying image than at the quadrants without an object. They flexibly adapted this gaze behavior on a trial‐by‐trial basis depending on where the object could be found in the underlying image. Importantly, this effect was found although the image was fully covered at the beginning of the contingent phase. Further, the effect was greater in the second half of the contingent phase than in the first half. That is, infants' looks at the objects increased throughout the contingent phase. This indicates that, as infants learned about the contingency, they increasingly directed their gaze to uncover the objects on the screen. Even after the contingency between infants' gaze and the scratching of the screen was interrupted in the disruption phase, infants continued to gaze more at the areas containing objects in the underlying image. That is, infants flexibly controlled their gaze to uncover information, even when this behavior was no longer positively reinforced. This enhanced gazing at the object areas increased with age between 6 and 10 months.

### Children's understanding of how past experience shapes future expectations [^eb7a23e7]. Child Development (2025). Medium credibility.

As adults, we do not expect ignorant agents to behave randomly or always get things wrong. Instead, we expect them to act reasonably, guided by past experiences. We test whether 4-to-6-year-olds share this intuition and use it to infer others' knowledge, or whether they rely on a simple "ignorance = error" heuristic identified in past work. Across three pre-registered experiments (n = 264 4-to-6-year-olds recruited in the US between 2018–2022; demographic data not collected), we find that 4-year-olds expect agents to draw on past experiences when acting in new situations. However, only 6-year-olds reliably use this expectation to infer others' knowledge from behavior. These findings suggest that by age 6, children use a causal model of how ignorance shapes behavior, and not just a cue-based understanding of epistemic states.
