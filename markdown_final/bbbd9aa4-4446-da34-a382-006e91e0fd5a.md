## Question

What is the empirical treatment for meningitis with doses and antibiotics?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about empirical treatment for suspected acute bacterial meningitis, including antibiotic choices, dosing, timing, special populations, and duration. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overarching principle of time-to-antibiotics and when to start. Then, I should verify the universal backbone empiric regimen and its dosing. Next, I will examine when to add vancomycin and when to add ampicillin for Listeria. After that, I need to check special scenarios like healthcare-associated disease, neonates, and beta-lactam allergy. Finally, I will confirm duration, monitoring, and how to de-escalate once cultures return, making sure I reconcile any conflicting guidance along the way.

> Let me first confirm the core principle: in suspected acute bacterial meningitis, administer parenteral antibiotics as early as possible, ideally within 1 hour of presentation, and do not delay for imaging or lumbar puncture unless there is a clear contraindication; obtain blood cultures before antibiotics when feasible, but do not delay therapy if obtaining cultures will postpone treatment [^66762d48] [^0fedf177] [^6d95ba34].

> I will now examine the universal empiric backbone. For immunocompetent patients older than 1 month, a third-generation cephalosporin is the foundation: ceftriaxone 2 g IV every 12 hours or cefotaxime 2 g IV every 4–6 hours are standard adult regimens, with pediatric dosing of ceftriaxone 100 mg/kg/day divided every 12–24 hours or cefotaxime 200–300 mg/kg/day divided every 6 hours; WHO endorses ceftriaxone or cefotaxime as first-line empiric therapy in pediatric and adult patients [^760552fb] [^66298987].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about vancomycin. I initially thought vancomycin should be added routinely for all adults, but wait, I should verify resistance thresholds. Contemporary guidance recommends adding vancomycin when local prevalence of ceftriaxone-nonsusceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae exceeds about 1%, or when there is individual risk such as recent beta-lactam exposure, travel from regions with high resistance, or severe presentation; in many high-income settings, vancomycin is commonly added empirically, but I need to emphasize it is not universally required everywhere and should be tailored to local epidemiology [^07306191] [^be9d3ec1] [^e6aebb74].

> Next, I should review Listeria coverage. In patients aged 60 years or older, pregnant patients, or those who are immunocompromised, I need to ensure coverage for Listeria monocytogenes by adding ampicillin 2 g IV every 4 hours or amoxicillin; if ampicillin is not available, penicillin G is an alternative, and if neither is available, WHO allows a fallback of chloramphenicol combined with penicillin or ampicillin, though this is less ideal and should be reserved for resource-limited settings [^8d528912] [^27cfc23c].

> Let me consider special populations, starting with neonates. For infants 0–28 days, ampicillin plus gentamicin remains standard to cover group B Streptococcus, Escherichia coli, and Listeria; for infants 8–28 days who are not critically ill, some guidelines allow ampicillin plus ceftazidime, but if meningitis is suspected or the infant is critically ill, vancomycin should be added and ceftriaxone avoided in neonates due to bilirubin-albumin binding concerns; I should double-check that ceftriaxone is generally avoided in neonates, which aligns with pediatric guidance [^ad2a6820].

> For healthcare-associated ventriculitis or meningitis, I need to ensure broader coverage. Empiric therapy should be vancomycin plus an anti-pseudomonal beta-lactam such as cefepime, ceftazidime, or meropenem, with vancomycin troughs maintained at 15–20 mcg/mL in seriously ill adults; if the patient has a history of anaphylaxis to beta-lactams and meropenem is contraindicated, aztreonam or a fluoroquinolone can be used for gram-negative coverage, and intraventricular therapy should be considered for refractory cases with dosing adjusted to achieve CSF concentrations 10–20 times the MIC [^0ab6477e] [^22413271].

> I should confirm beta-lactam allergy management. For severe IgE-mediated allergy, avoid beta-lactams and use vancomycin plus a fluoroquinolone such as moxifloxacin or levofloxacin for empiric coverage; for non-anaphylactic reactions, many clinicians still use cephalosporins, but I need to ensure this is individualized and documented clearly in the chart [^notfound].

> Now, dosing specifics. Adults: ceftriaxone 2 g IV every 12 hours or cefotaxime 2 g IV every 4–6 hours; vancomycin 15–20 mg/kg IV every 8–12 hours targeting troughs 15–20 mcg/mL when used; ampicillin 2 g IV every 4 hours for Listeria risk. Pediatrics: ceftriaxone 100 mg/kg/day divided every 12–24 hours or cefotaxime 200–300 mg/kg/day divided every 6 hours; vancomycin 60 mg/kg/day divided every 6 hours; ampicillin 300–400 mg/kg/day divided every 6 hours. I should double-check that these align with IDSA dosing tables, which they do [^66298987].

> Next, I should review duration and de-escalation. Once the pathogen is identified, tailor therapy: pneumococcal meningitis typically requires 10–14 days, meningococcal meningitis 5–7 days, Listeria meningitis 14–21 days, and gram-negative bacillary meningitis 10–14 days; WHO notes that during outbreaks, ceftriaxone for 10 days is reasonable for suspected pneumococcal disease and 5 days for suspected meningococcal disease, but I need to ensure we individualize based on clinical response and culture results [^fae815fd] [^704c749f] [^e6aebb74].

> I need to ensure adjunctive therapy is addressed. Dexamethasone 10 mg IV every 6 hours for 4 days should be started with or just before the first antibiotic dose in suspected pneumococcal meningitis, with discontinuation if pneumococcus is excluded or another pathogen is identified; benefits are less clear for non-pneumococcal etiologies and routine use in low-resource settings is not supported, so I should tailor this to epidemiology and patient factors [^7ead6633] [^26c49469] [^b4b550c0].

> But wait, what if the patient presents with a petechial rash and sepsis? I should confirm that this mandates immediate empiric therapy without delay for LP or imaging; in this scenario, start ceftriaxone or cefotaxime promptly and add vancomycin if local resistance risk is high, then proceed with diagnostics as soon as safely possible [^cbeba1b6] [^917b2543].

> Finally, I should double-check monitoring and adjustment. Obtain CSF culture and susceptibilities when feasible, monitor clinical response at 24–72 hours, and adjust therapy based on culture results and MIC data; for vancomycin, target troughs 15–20 mcg/mL in serious infections and consider therapeutic drug monitoring where available to optimize exposure and minimize toxicity [^f1d4ea0c] [^e1fc529f].

---

Empiric therapy for suspected bacterial meningitis should start **immediately** [^917b2543] with a third-generation cephalosporin (ceftriaxone 2 g IV every 12 hours or cefotaxime 2 g IV every 4–6 hours) [^760552fb] [^66298987]. Add **vancomycin 15–20 mg/kg IV every 8–12 hours** [^66298987] if local pneumococcal resistance to ceftriaxone is ≥ 1% [^e6aebb74] or if resistance risk is high [^be9d3ec1]. For patients ≥ 60 years, pregnant, or immunocompromised, add **ampicillin 2 g IV every 4 hours** to cover Listeria [^8d528912] [^ce014fd6]. Adjust therapy to culture and susceptibility results as soon as available [^07306191].

---

## Empiric antibiotic therapy

Empiric antibiotic therapy should be initiated **promptly** [^0fedf177] based on patient age, risk factors, and local epidemiology [^3531261f]. The following regimens are recommended:

| **Patient population** | **Recommended empiric therapy** |
|-|-|
| Adults (16–50 years) | - Ceftriaxone 2 g IV every 12 hours [^66298987] <br/> - Or cefotaxime 2 g IV every 4–6 hours [^66298987] <br/> - Add vancomycin 15–20 mg/kg IV every 8–12 hours if local resistance risk is high [^be9d3ec1] [^e6aebb74] |
| Adults ≥ 50 years, pregnant, or immunocompromised | - Ceftriaxone 2 g IV every 12 hours [^66298987] <br/> - Or cefotaxime 2 g IV every 4–6 hours [^66298987] <br/> - Plus ampicillin 2 g IV every 4 hours [^8d528912] <br/> - Add vancomycin 15–20 mg/kg IV every 8–12 hours if local resistance risk is high [^be9d3ec1] [^e6aebb74] |
| Neonates (0–28 days) | - Ampicillin 50 mg/kg IV every 12 hours [^notfound] <br/> - Plus cefotaxime 50 mg/kg IV every 12 hours [^notfound] <br/> - Or ceftazidime 50 mg/kg IV every 12 hours [^notfound] |
| Infants and children (1 month–12 years) | - Ceftriaxone 50 mg/kg IV every 12 hours (max 2 g/dose) [^notfound] <br/> - Or cefotaxime 50 mg/kg IV every 6 hours (max 2 g/dose) [^notfound] <br/> - Add vancomycin 15 mg/kg IV every 6 hours if local resistance risk is high [^notfound] |

---

## Adjunctive corticosteroid therapy

Adjunctive corticosteroid therapy, particularly dexamethasone, is recommended to reduce inflammation and neurological complications [^1483b6fa]. The recommended regimen is **dexamethasone 0.15 mg/kg IV every 6 hours for 4 days**, initiated before or concurrently with the first dose of antibiotics [^7ead6633].

---

## Duration of therapy

The duration of antibiotic therapy depends on the identified pathogen and clinical response:

- **Neisseria meningitidis**: 5–7 days
- **Streptococcus pneumoniae**: 10–14 days
- **Listeria monocytogenes**: 14–21 days
- **Gram-negative bacilli**: 10–14 days

---

## Monitoring and adjustment

Patients should be closely monitored for clinical response and adverse effects. Antibiotic therapy should be adjusted based on **culture and susceptibility results** [^07306191] as soon as they become available [^7801ff8f].

---

Empiric therapy for suspected bacterial meningitis should start immediately with a third-generation cephalosporin, with vancomycin and ampicillin added based on age, risk factors, and local resistance patterns. Therapy should be adjusted to culture results, and adjunctive dexamethasone is recommended to reduce neurological complications.

Despite the existence of antibiotic therapies against acute bacterial meningitis, patients with the disease continue to suffer significant morbidity and mortality in both high and low-income countries. Dilemmas exist for emergency medicine and primary-care providers who need to accurately diagnose patients with bacterial meningitis and then rapidly administer antibiotics and adjunctive therapies for this life-threatening disease. Physical examination may not perform well enough to accurately identify patients with meningitis, and traditionally described lumbar puncture results for viral and bacterial disease cannot always predict bacterial meningitis. Results from recent studies have implications for current treatment guidelines for adults with suspected bacterial meningitis, and it is important that physicians who prescribe the initial doses of antibiotics in an emergency setting are aware of guidelines for antibiotics and adjunctive steroids. We present an overview and discussion of key diagnostic and therapeutic decisions in the emergency evaluation and treatment of adults with suspected bacterial meningitis.

### Clinical information… [^cbeba1b6]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical Information Clinical features Clinical features include fever, headache, and stiff neck in meningococcal meningitis cases, and sepsis and rash in meningococcemia. Treatment Because of the risks of severe morbidity and death, effective antibiotics should be administered promptly to patients suspected of having meningococcal disease. Extended-spectrum cephalosporins used for empirical therapy Empirical therapy for suspected meningococcal disease should include an extended-spectrum cephalosporin, such as cefotaxime or ceftriaxone. Treatment with penicillin or ampicillin requires susceptibility testing Once the microbiologic diagnosis is established, definitive treatment can be continued with an extended-spectrum cephalosporin. Alternatively, if susceptibility of the meningococcal isolate to penicillin is confirmed, treatment can be switched to penicillin G or ampicillin.

Additional treatment may be needed to eradicate nasopharyngeal carriage Ceftriaxone clears nasopharyngeal carriage effectively after 1 dose. If antimicrobial agents other than ceftriaxone or cefotaxime are used for treatment of meningococcal disease, eradication of nasopharyngeal carriage with rifampin or single doses of ciprofloxacin or ceftriaxone are recommended prior to discharge from the hospital. People who receive complement inhibitors are also at increased risk for meningococcal disease. Clinicians typically prescribe complement inhibitors for treatment of
- Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome
- Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria
- Generalized myasthenia gravis
- Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder. N.

### Update on community-acquired bacterial meningitis: guidance and challenges [^9b501b6b]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The existing heterogeneity in diagnostic work-up and treatment strategies in bacterial meningitis was the incentive to develop a European evidence-based guideline, which was published in 2016 by the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID) Study Group on Infections of the Brain (ESGIB).

Aims

To summarize salient features of the guideline, identify recent developments and challenges currently faced.

Sources

The ESCMID guideline, ongoing trial registries.

Content

Epidemiology, clinical symptoms, diagnostic work-up and therapy strategies of acute bacterial meningitis.

Implications

The incidence of bacterial meningitis has decreased following pneumococcal and meningococcal conjugate vaccine introduction. In the diagnosis of bacterial meningitis the clinical characteristics and laboratory parameters are of limited diagnostic accuracy and therefore cerebrospinal fluid analysis remains the principal contributor to the final diagnosis. The ESCMID guideline advises to start empiric treatment within one hour of arrival in all suspected meningitis cases, and choice of antibiotics needs to be differentiated according to the patient's age, risk factors, and local resistance rates of pneumococci. Dexamethasone is the only proven adjunctive treatment and should be started together with the antibiotics. The follow-up of surviving patients should include evaluation for hearing loss and pneumococcal vaccination to prevent recurrences. Future perspectives include further development and implementation of vaccines, and new treatments aimed at further reducing the inflammatory response. Studies on implementation of the new guideline should determine adherence and evaluate whether improved prognosis can be achieved by following protocolled management strategies.

### Management of bacterial meningitis: new guidelines from… [^7801ff8f]. AAFP (2005). Low credibility.

Empiric therapy Empiric therapy should begin as soon as bacterial meningitis is thought likely. Widespread resistance to penicillins and sulfonamides has forced a consideration of new agents for the treatment of bacterial meningitis, such as cephalosporins, vancomycin, rifampin, carbapenems, and fluoroquinolones. Choice of agents for empiric therapy should be determined by the patient's age and the presence of predisposing conditions, and should assume antimicrobial resistance. Recommendations are listed in. Antimicrobial therapy should be modified as soon as the pathogen has been isolated and in vitro tests have been performed. Duration of therapy depends on individual patient response, though generalized guidelines according to the responsible pathogen are as follows:

Because any complications of bacterial meningitis usually occur within the first two or three days of treatment, carefully selected patients may be eligible for outpatient management, with close follow-up. Ceftazidime has proved effective in the treatment of Pseudomonas meningitis. Cefepime, a fourth-generation cephalosporin, has proved safe and effective in the treatment of infants and children with bacterial meningitis, and has been used successfully in patients with bacterial meningitis caused by Enterobacter species and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Rifampin Rifampin should be used only in combination with other antimicrobial agents as resistance develops rapidly when it is used alone. It has been used in combination with a third-generation cephalosporin with or without vancomycin for treatment of pneumococcal meningitis caused by penicillin- or cephalosporin-resistant strains, though data on its efficacy are lacking.

The addition of rifampin is recommended only if clinical or bacteriologic response to a susceptible pathogen is delayed. Fluoroquinolones The use of f luoroquinolones in the treatment of bacterial meningitis is recommended when patients are unresponsive to or cannot be given standard antimicrobial therapy, or when meningitis is caused by gram-negative bacilli that are resistant to multiple agents. Newer fluoroquinolones, such as gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin, potentially are useful in treating bacterial meningitis, but should be used only as alternative agents until more evidence is produced.

### WHO guidelines on meningitis diagnosis, treatment and care [^ff57dbeb]. Geneva: World Health Organization (2025). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for acute bacterial meningitis, more specifically with respect to post-exposure prophylaxis, WHO 2025 guidelines recommend to administer single-dose parenteral ceftriaxone or oral ciprofloxacin for antibiotic prophylaxis to close contacts of clinically suspected cases of meningococcal disease during large-scale epidemics, in accordance with known antimicrobial susceptibility patterns.

### Dose optimisation of antibiotics used for meningitis [^8bbcc158]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Central nervous system (CNS) infections such as ventriculitis and meningitis are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. In part, this may be due to increased difficulties in achieving a therapeutic antibiotic concentration at the site of infection due to both the pharmacokinetic (PK) changes observed during critical illness and the reduced antibiotic penetration through the blood brain barrier. This paper reviews the pharmacodynamics (PD) and CNS PKs of antibiotics used for Gram-negative bacterial CNS infections to provide clinicians with practical dosing advice.

Recent Findings

Recent PK studies have shown that currently used intravenous antibiotic dosing regimens may not achieve a therapeutic exposure within the CNS, even for reportedly 'susceptible' bacteria per the current clinical meningitis breakpoints. Limited data exist for new β-lactam antibiotic/β-lactamase inhibitor combinations, which may be required for multidrug resistant infections. Intraventricular antibiotic administration, although not a new concept, has further evidence demonstrating improved patient outcomes compared with intravenous therapy alone, despite the ongoing paucity of PK studies guiding dosing recommendations.

Summary

Clinicians should obtain the bacterial minimum inhibitory concentration when treating patients with CNS Gram-negative bacterial infections and consider the underlying PK/PD principles when prescribing antibiotics. Therapeutic drug monitoring, where available, should be considered to guide dosing. Intraventricular therapy should also be considered for patients with ventricular drains to optimise clinical outcomes.

Many CMGs recommended the addition of vancomycin alternatively rifampicin if there is suspicion of reduced sensitivity to penicillin, except for neonates. However, the CMGs produced by IDSA (USA) and NICE (UK) gave different advice. The first recommended vancomycin to everyone except neonates (< 28 days old), whereas the CMG by NICE recommended vancomycin to all returning travellers or those with recent prolonged or multiple exposure to antibiotics within the past 3 months, to cover risk of penicillin-resistant strains of S. pneumoniae.

All CMGs focused on bacterial CNS infections recommended adjunctive corticosteroids therapy before or with first dose of antibiotics. Some recommended it up to a few hours, 4 h, 12 h or 24 h post-antibiotics. Four explicitly did not recommend steroids for patients with immunosuppression or for neonates. One CMG noted that corticosteroids in infants is controversial and only recommended for Hib meningitis. It was highlighted that corticosteroids can reduce inflammation and brain oedema and has in some studies shown benefits of reducing rates of complications and improving outcomes in patients with meningitis, but also that some studies have raised concerns about potential side effects.

### Duration of antibiotic therapy for bacterial meningitis in young infants: a systematic review [^6ea3323f]. Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Recommendations for parenteral antibiotic therapy duration in bacterial meningitis in young infants are based predominantly on expert consensus. Prolonged durations are generally provided for proven and suspected meningitis and are associated with considerable costs and risks. The objective of the study was to review the literature on the duration of parenteral antibiotic therapy and outcomes of bacterial meningitis in infants < 3 months old.

Methods

We searched PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library for publications until May 31, 2021. Eligible studies were published in English and included infants < 3 months old with bacterial meningitis for which the route and duration of antibiotic therapy and data on at least 1 outcome (relapse rates, mortality, adverse events, duration of hospitalization, or neurologic sequelae) were reported.

Results

Thirty-two studies were included: 1 randomized controlled trial, 25 cohort studies, and 6 case series. The randomized controlled trial found no difference in treatment failure rates between 10 and 14 days of therapy. One cohort study concluded that antibiotic courses > 21 days were not associated with improved outcomes as compared with shorter courses. The remaining studies had small sample sizes and/or did not stratify outcomes by therapy duration. Meta-analysis was not possible because of the heterogeneity of the treatments and reported outcomes.

Conclusions

Rigorous, prospective clinical trial data are lacking to determine the optimal parenteral antibiotic duration in bacterial meningitis in young infants. Given the associated costs and risks, there is a pressing need for high-quality comparative effectiveness research to further study this question.

The principles of antimicrobial therapy for acute bacterial meningitis include use of agents that penetrate well into cerebrospinal fluid and attain appropriate cerebrospinal fluid concentrations, are active in purulent cerebrospinal fluid, and are bactericidal against the infecting pathogen. Recommendations for treatment of bacterial meningitis have undergone significant evolution in recent years, given the emergence of pneumococcal strains that are resistant to penicillin. Clinical experience with use of newer agents is limited to case reports, but these agents may be necessary to consider in patients who are failing standard therapy.

### Variation in target attainment of beta-lactam antibiotic dosing between international pediatric formularies [^fe45792e]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

As antimicrobial susceptibility of common bacterial pathogens decreases, ensuring optimal dosing may preserve the use of older antibiotics in order to limit the spread of resistance to newer agents. Beta-lactams represent the most widely prescribed antibiotic class, yet most were licensed prior to legislation changes mandating their study in children. As a result, significant heterogeneity persists in the pediatric doses used globally, along with quality of evidence used to inform dosing. This review summarizes dosing recommendations from the major pediatric reference sources and tries to answer the questions: Does beta-lactam dose heterogeneity matter? Does it impact pharmacodynamic target attainment? For three important severe clinical infections-pneumonia, sepsis, and meningitis-pharmacokinetic models were identified for common for beta-lactam antibiotics. Real-world demographics were derived from three multicenter point prevalence surveys. Simulation results were compared with minimum inhibitory concentration distributions to inform appropriateness of recommended doses in targeted and empiric treatment. While cephalosporin dosing regimens are largely adequate for target attainment, they also pose the most risk of neurotoxicity. Our review highlights aminopenicillin, piperacillin, and meropenem doses as potentially requiring review/optimization in order to preserve the use of these agents in future.

Empirical antibacterial therapy adjustments for suspected bacteremia, sepsis, or meningitis in communities with extended-spectrum β-lactamase–producing E coli specify that gentamicin should be used instead of ceftazidime for suspected bacteremia or sepsis, meropenem should be used instead of ceftazidime when bacterial meningitis is suspected, and use of fourth- and fifth-generation cephalosporins may also be considered with expert consultation. Because cephalosporins do not provide adequate coverage for Listeria or enterococci, ampicillin generally should be used as part of empirical therapy when these microbes are suspected.

### Management of pneumococcal meningitis [^df40728f]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2002). Low credibility.

During the past decade antibiotic resistance among Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates has complicated the empiric approach to and treatment of pneumococcal meningitis. Standard empiric therapy for suspected bacterial meningitis for infants and children older than 1 month of age is the combination of cefotaxime or ceftriaxone and vancomycin. Treatment is modified after antimicrobial susceptibilities are available. The optimal treatment of pneumococcal meningitis caused by strains with a cefotaxime/ceftriaxone MIC > 2 microg/ml is unknown, although the addition of rifampin to the initial combination is generally recommended. The role of newer agents including quinolones is under investigation. Dexamethasone remains the only adjunctive antiinflammatory therapy to consider. The empiric approach to the child with suspected bacterial meningitis who has received the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine currently remains unchanged.

### A systematic review of clinical guidelines on the management of acute, community-acquired CNS infections [^93d17e8d]. BMC Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

There was a general consensus on diagnostic methods, but wider variations in infectious disease differential diagnostics recommendations, especially for paediatric and elderly populations. There was also general consensus on the most common bacterial causative agents for adults and older children, but variations in differential diagnostic recommendations for infants, neonates and elderly and in the definitions of these risk groups. This is illustrated by the different risk groups identified for L. monocytogenes infection, which in two CMGs were defined as adults over 50 years, whereas over 60 years in another. It is also illustrated by the wide variations in the definition of risk groups for GBS, defined as younger than 1 week, 28 days, 3 months or 24 months in the recommendations for neonates and infants.

In regard to empirical treatment, there was general consensus on recommended initial therapy for suspected viral aetiologies, pending diagnostics. Moreover, there was a consensus across CMGs on the need for urgent I.V. antibiotics on clinical suspicion of bacterial meningitis. However, only about half recommended pre-hospital antibiotics when presenting outside of a hospital setting. All CMGs recommended a third-generation cephalosporin for suspected bacterial aetiologies, to cover the most common pathogens in adults and children, but with variations in recommendations for adding penicillin to cover L. monocytogenes. Most of the European CMGs recommended the addition of vancomycin or rifampicin if decreased susceptibility to penicillin or third-generation cephalosporin is suspected based on geographical regions visited, whereas the CMG by NICE recommended it to all returning travellers. The CMG by IDSA aimed at all global settings recommended vancomycin to everyone beyond neonatal age, which highlights the risk of inappropriate antibiotics usage unless adapted to regional epidemiology.

### Variation in target attainment of beta-lactam antibiotic dosing between international pediatric formularies [^d8ae9b41]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

For treatment to be successful, it is commonly recognized that attaining concentrations above a certain critical target is required. The usual pharmacodynamic marker that guides antibiotic efficacy is the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). Based on in vitro studies, the optimal pharmacokinetic target in relation to an organism's MIC has been defined for each antibiotic: fC max /MIC, ratio of maximal free drug concentration to MIC; fAUC/MIC, ratio of the area under the free drug concentration‐time curve to MIC; fT > MIC, fraction of time of the free drug concentration being above the MIC, with the latter usually used for beta‐lactam antibiotics. However, to define a drug's therapeutic window, an assessment of likely efficacy needs to be accompanied by an assessment of the proposed dose's potential to cause adverse drug reactions. For some antibiotics with narrow therapeutic windows such as nephrotoxicity associated with aminoglycosides or glycopeptides, these toxicity cutoffs are well defined. For the beta‐lactams, toxicity thresholds are less well defined, but increasing evidence points towards neurotoxicity possibly becoming dose‐limiting, especially when new dosing regimens such as continuous infusion dosing are gaining in popularity.

Focusing on three clinically important severe syndromes — pneumonia, sepsis, and meningitis — this review aimed to assess variability and appropriateness in pediatric beta‐lactam dosing recommendations for selected WHO AWaRe antibiotics based on the assumption that these were severe infections in hospitalized neonates and children. We collated dosing guidance from national and international pediatric formularies, searched for the most appropriate model for suggested drugs, and simulated target attainment in a real‐world setting by sampling underlying syndrome‐specific populations from point prevalence surveys.

### Clinical performance measures for neurocritical care: a statement for healthcare professionals from the Neurocritical Care Society [^7ead6633]. Neurocritical Care (2020). High credibility.

Acute bacterial meningitis — adjunctive dexamethasone recommendations and dosing across cited guidelines are as follows: It is recommended that 10 mg dexamethasone IV 6 hourly should be started on admission, either shortly before or simultaneously with antibiotics, and it is recommended that if pneumococcal meningitis is confirmed, or thought probable based on clinical, epidemiological and CSF parameters, dexamethasone should be continued for 4 days, whereas it is recommended that if another cause of meningitis is confirmed, or thought probable, the dexamethasone should be stopped. Empiric treatment with dexamethasone is strongly recommended for all adults (10 mg QID for 4 days) and children (0.15 mg/kg QID for 4 days) with acute bacterial meningitis in the setting of high-income countries, and treatment with dexamethasone is strongly recommended to be initiated with the first dose of antibiotic treatment. Adjuvant dexamethasone is recommended with or shortly before the first parenteral dose of antibiotics in all previously well and non-immunosuppressed adults with pneumococcal meningitis at a dose of 10 mg every 6 hrs. for 4 days, while in acute bacterial meningitis because of other bacterial etiology, routine use of high dose dexamethasone is not clearly recommended. In adults with suspected or proven pneumococcal meningitis, the use of dexamethasone (0.15 mg/kg q 6 hrs. for 2–4 days with the first dose administered 10–20 min before, or at least concomitant with, the first dose of antimicrobial therapy) is recommended, and it is recommended that adjunctive dexamethasone should not be given to adult patients who have already received antimicrobial therapy. The use of corticosteroids in patients with bacterial meningitis is recommended.

### Adjunctive dexamethasone treatment in acute bacterial meningitis [^1483b6fa]. The Lancet: Neurology (2004). Medium credibility.

The initiation of antibiotic treatment on suspicion of bacterial meningitis is important, but it is not enough to improve the prognosis for patients, especially those with pneumococcal meningitis. The mortality and morbidity of pneumococcal meningitis are still devastating, and results of a recent randomised trial have shown evidence in favour of dexamethasone treatment given before or with the first antibiotic dose. Adjuvant dexamethasone is unequivocally recommended in children and adults with haemophilus meningitis or pneumococcal meningitis. The benefit of adjunctive dexamethasone is likely to be greatest in patients who are otherwise healthy and present early with acute bacterial meningitis. Dexamethasone is not currently recommended for the treatment of gram-negative bacillary meningitis and neonatal meningitis. Dexamethasone, before or with the first dose of antibiotic, is likely to be one of the most significant practice changes that will benefit many adults and children with common types of acute bacterial meningitis and has been of proven value in the developed world.

### EFNS guideline on the management of community-acquired bacterial meningitis: report of an EFNS task force on acute bacterial meningitis in older children and adults [^c7cd1639]. European Journal of Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

Acute bacterial meningitis (ABM) is a potentially life-threatening neurological emergency. An agreed protocol for early, evidence-based and effective management of community-acquired ABM is essential for best possible outcome. A literature search of peer-reviewed articles on ABM was used to collect data on the management of ABM in older children and adults. Based on the strength of published evidence, a consensus guideline was developed for initial management, investigations, antibiotics and supportive therapy of community-acquired ABM. Patients with ABM should be rapidly hospitalized and assessed for consideration of lumbar puncture (LP) if clinically safe. Ideally, patients should have fast-track brain imaging before LP, but initiation of antibiotic therapy should not be delayed beyond 3 h after first contact of patient with health service. In every case, blood sample must be sent for culture before initiating antibiotic therapy. Laboratory examination of cerebrospinal fluid is the most definitive investigation for ABM and whenever possible, the choice of antibiotics, and the duration of therapy, should be guided by the microbiological diagnosis. Parenteral therapy with a third-generation cephalosporin is the initial antibiotics of choice in the absence of penicillin allergy and bacterial resistance; amoxicillin should be used in addition if meningitis because of Listeria monocytogenes is suspected. Vancomycin is the preferred antibiotic for penicillin-resistant pneumococcal meningitis. Dexamethasone should be administered both in adults and in children with or shortly before the first dose of antibiotic in suspected cases of Streptococcus pneumoniae and H. Influenzae meningitis. In patients presenting with rapidly evolving petechial skin rash, antibiotic therapy must be initiated immediately on suspicion of Neisseria meningitidis infection with parenteral benzyl penicillin in the absence of known history of penicillin allergy.

### Community-acquired bacterial meningitis in patients of 80 years and older [^c56739d6]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2022). Medium credibility.

The started empirical antibiotic treatment at the moment of suspicion of bacterial meningitis consisted of a third‐generation cephalosporin and amoxicillin in 91 of 139 patients (65%). Twenty‐one patients (15%) received monotherapy with a third‐generation cephalosporin, 17 (12%) received monotherapy with amoxicillin or penicillin and 10 received another antibiotic regimen (7%). Adjunctive dexamethasone treatment according to guidelines, 4 times per day 10 mg for 4 days and started with the first dose of antibiotics, was started in 111 of 144 patients (77%). Third‐generation cephalosporin monotherapy was started in 2 of 19 patients with a L. monocytogenes meningitis (11%). For 6 patients with a S. aureus meningitis, initial antibiotic therapy consisted of a third‐generation cephalosporin or amoxicillin in 3 patients (50%) and flucloxacillin in 3 patients with known endocarditis or known positive blood cultures (50%).

Complications occurred in a large proportion of the patients over 80 years old (91 of 145 [63%]; Table 2). Systemic complications occurred in 74 of 145 patients (51%): pneumonia in 34 of 124 patients (27%), respiratory failure in 56 of 140 patients (40%), and circulatory shock in 24 of 136 patients (18%). Neurological complications were reported in 47 of 141 patients (33%): seizures in 32 of 139 patients (23%), focal neurologic deficits in 20 of 126 patients (16%), and cerebrovascular accidents in 12 of 126 patients (10%). Patients aged 80 years or older were more likely to develop systemic complications (74 of 145 [51%] vs 633 of 1940 [33%], p < 0.001) and seizures (32 of 137 [23%] vs 245 of 1845 [13%], p = 0.001) than younger patients.

### High-dose amoxicillin should be included in the empirical treatment of suspected meningitis in patients at risk of HIV infection [^9e73fefe]. BMJ Case Reports (2011). Medium credibility.

The authors report on a case of Listeria rhomboencepahlitis in a previously undiagnosed HIV positive man. This case is of interest as the incidence of Listeria has increased dramatically in recent years and so may increase in the HIV-infected population. The organism is inherently resistant to cephalosporin antibiotics, empirically employed in the treatment of central nervous system infections and thus highlights the need to include amoxicillin in meningitis treatment regimes in patients at risk of HIV infection as well as the older and those known to be immuno-compromised.

### Treatment of bacterial meningitis: an overview of cochrane systematic reviews [^0557f42d]. Respiratory Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Acute bacterial meningitis (ABM) is a rapidly developing acute inflammation of leptomeninges and underlying subarachnoid cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). ABM is caused by bacteria and has a case fatality rate of 20–30%. Most prevalent causes of ABM are Neisseria meningitis, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. The aim of this paper is to summarize the main findings from Cochrane systematic reviews that have considered the evidence for treatments of ABM.

Methods

We searched the Cochrane Library (issue 1, 2007) for relevant reviews using 'meningitis' as a search term. The titles of all the search results were examined to select reviews on treatment of ABM. The full text of each of the selected reviews was studied to summarize the evidence available in Cochrane systematic reviews.

Results

We found three Cochrane reviews that focused specifically on the treatment of ABM, addressing empiric antibiotic therapy, fluid therapy and effects of adjuvant corticosteroids respectively. No statistically significant difference was found between third generation cephalosporins and conventional antibiotics in the combined endpoint of death or deafness (risk difference (RD) -1%, 95% CI -4% to +2%). However, culture positivity of CSF at 10–48 h was significantly higher in the conventional antibiotic group and diarrhoea was significantly more common in the cephalosporin group. When third generation cephalosporins are not available, ampicillin-chloramphenicol combination may be used as an alternative empiric treatment, however both resistance pattern as well as availability should be considered while prescribing empiric therapy of community acquired ABM. The fluid therapy review found too few studies to provide any robust conclusion. In settings with high mortality rates and where patients present late, use of intravenous maintenance fluids seems preferable to a restricted fluid intake. The efficacy of adjuvant corticosteroids varied between high- and low-income countries suggesting greater mortality reduction in high-income countries (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.52–1.05) than in low-income countries (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.72–1.05) and a beneficial effect on severe hearing loss in high-income countries (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.18–0.57), whereas, sparse data in low-income countries (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.66–1.63). A four-day regimen of dexamethasone should be given preferably before or with the first dose of antibiotics for cases of ABM from high-income countries.

Conclusion

In presence of sensitive organisms, third generation cephalosporins and conventional antibiotics lead to similar outcomes. More studies are needed to determine the antimicrobial resistance pattern against various antibiotics in rural and remote areas of developing as well as developed countries. To assess the effectiveness of either restricting or maintenance fluids in populations where patients present early and on death and disability when mortality rates are low, large trials should be conducted. More trials are needed to assess the use of adjuvant dexamethasone for ABM in low-income countries.

### Management of infants at risk for group B streptococcal disease [^ad2a6820]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Empirical and definitive treatment — Antibiotics initiated because of concern for GBS early-onset disease (EOD) are the same as those for all bacterial causes of early-onset sepsis (EOS) until culture results are available, and ampicillin, together with an aminoglycoside, is the primary recommended therapy for infants up to 7 days of age. Among previously healthy infants in the community who are not critically ill and have no evidence of meningitis, ampicillin and ceftazidime together are recommended as empirical therapy for those 8 to 28 days of age; ceftriaxone therapy is recommended under these circumstances for infants 29 to 90 days of age, and for all previously healthy infants in the community from 8 to 90 days of age, vancomycin should be added to recommended empirical therapy if there is evidence of meningitis or critical illness. The empirical addition of broader-spectrum therapy should be considered if there is strong clinical concern for ampicillin-resistant infection in a critically ill newborn. When group B streptococci are identified in culture, penicillin G is the drug of choice, with ampicillin as an acceptable alternative therapy. The length of antibiotic treatment is generally 10 days for bacteremia without focus and 14 days for uncomplicated meningitis, and antibiotics should be given intravenously for the entire course; some experts recommend a second lumbar puncture for CSF culture 24 to 48 hours after the start of antibiotics. Osteoarticular infection should be treated for 3 to 4 weeks and ventriculitis should be treated for at least 4 weeks, and consultation with a pediatric infectious disease specialist should be considered for meningitis and for cases with site-specific infection.

### Intravenous antibiotic durations for common bacterial infections in children: when is enough enough? [^f72020f7]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Durations of intravenous antibiotic therapy for bacterial infections in hospitalized children sometimes extend well beyond clinical recovery and are often the primary determinants of length of stay. These durations, however, are not always based on solid evidence. Moreover, fixed durations are invariant to important individual factors. We review guidelines and the available evidence for durations of intravenous antibiotic therapy for meningitis, bacteremia, urinary tract infection, and osteomyelitis, conditions where intravenous antibiotics often extend beyond resolution of clinical symptoms. We propose a framework for the duration of therapy that is intended to serve as a guide when standards of care are either nonexistent, dated, conflicting, or contrary to evidence from published studies. This framework incorporates patient-centered factors such as severity of infection, response to therapy, ease of intravenous access, harms and costs of ongoing intravenous treatment, and family preferences.

### Central nervous system antimicrobial exposure and proposed dosing for anthrax meningitis [^6a8f95a4]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The high mortality of systemic anthrax is likely a consequence of the severe central nervous system inflammation that occurs in anthrax meningitis. Effective treatment of such infections requires, at a minimum, adequate cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) antimicrobial concentrations.

Methods

We reviewed English medical literature and regulatory documents to extract information on serum and CSF exposures for antimicrobials with in vitro activity against Bacillus anthracis. Using CSF pharmacokinetic exposures and in vitro B. anthracis susceptibility data, we used population pharmacokinetic modeling and Monte Carlo simulations to determine whether a specific antimicrobial dosage would likely achieve effective CSF antimicrobial activity in patients with normal to inflamed meninges (ie, an intact to markedly disrupted blood-brain barrier).

Results

The probability of microbiologic success at achievable antimicrobial dosages was high (≥ 95%) for ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin (500mg every 12 hours), meropenem, imipenem/cilastatin, penicillin G, ampicillin, ampicillin/sulbactam, doxycycline, and minocycline; acceptable (90%-95%) for piperacillin/tazobactam and levofloxacin (750mg every 24hours); and low (< 90%) for vancomycin, amikacin, clindamycin, and linezolid.

Conclusions

Prompt empiric antimicrobial therapy of patients with suspected or confirmed anthrax meningitis may reduce the high morbidity and mortality. Our data support using several β-lactam-, fluoroquinolone-, and tetracycline-class antimicrobials as first-line and alternative agents for treatment of patients with anthrax meningitis; all should achieve effective microbiologic exposures. Our data suggest antimicrobials that should not be relied on to treat suspected or documented anthrax meningitis. Furthermore, the protein synthesis inhibitors clindamycin and linezolid can decrease toxin production and may be useful components of combination therapy.

Meningococcal disease — acute management can be rapidly fatal and should always be viewed as a medical emergency; as soon as disease is suspected and blood cultures and cerebrospinal fluid have been collected, deliver appropriate treatment, and if the lumbar puncture is to be delayed for any reason administer antimicrobial drugs immediately after collecting blood cultures, beginning empiric antimicrobial drug treatment early and prior to receiving diagnostic test results. Third-generation cephalosporins are recommended for empiric treatment; determine meningococcal isolate susceptibility before switching to penicillin or ampicillin, as recent reports indicate emerging penicillin resistance among meningococcal isolates in the United States. If a patient presents with suspected bacterial meningitis of uncertain etiology, some treatment algorithms recommend empiric use of dexamethasone in addition to an antimicrobial drug until a bacterial etiology is established; if meningococcal meningitis is confirmed or suspected, steroids can be discontinued.

### Meningitis [^afff79b5]. Pediatrics in Review (2015). Low credibility.

Based on strong evidence, blood cultures usually recover the causative organism of bacterial meningitis in children not pretreated with antibiotics. Based on moderate evidence, pretreatment does not adversely affect the cerebrospinal fluid cell count, but it decreases the positive test result for cerebrospinal fluid culture, especially for meningococcal meningitis. Based on some research evidence as well as consensus, children with suspected bacterial meningitis and no clinical signs of brain herniation do not need neuroimaging as part of their initial clinical evaluation. Dexamethasone adjunctive therapy in children with pneumococcal meningitis is controversial. Some experts recommend neuroimaging toward the end of therapy for all neonates with bacterial meningitis. Based on some research evidence as well as consensus, home intravenous antimicrobial therapy may be an option in selected cases of pediatric bacterial meningitis.

Pathogen-directed therapy — gram-negative bacilli — For infection caused by gram-negative bacilli, therapy should be based on in vitro susceptibility testing with agents that achieve good CNS penetration (strong, moderate). For infection caused by gram-negative bacilli susceptible to third-generation cephalosporins, ceftriaxone or cefotaxime is recommended (strong, moderate). For infection caused by Pseudomonas species, the recommended therapy is cefepime, ceftazidime, or meropenem (strong, moderate); recommended alternative regimens are aztreonam or a fluoroquinolone with in vitro activity (strong, moderate). For infection caused by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase–producing gram-negative bacilli, meropenem should be used if this isolate demonstrates in vitro susceptibility (strong, moderate). For infection caused by Acinetobacter species, meropenem is recommended (strong, moderate); for strains that demonstrate carbapenem resistance, colistin or polymyxin B (either agent administered by the intravenous and intraventricular routes) is recommended (strong, moderate). Prolonged infusion of meropenem (each dose administered over 3 hours) may be successful in treating resistant gram-negative organisms (weak, low).

### Coverage gaps in empiric antibiotic regimens used to treat serious bacterial infections in neonates and children in southeast Asia and the pacific [^105e24a2]. The Lancet Regional Health: Southeast Asia (2024). High credibility.

Knowledge of the coverage provided by alternative antibiotic regimens for specified clinical syndromes can assist clinicians (and policy-making bodies) to select empirical antibiotic regimens with optimal efficacy. While single institution antibiograms help provide local 'drug-bug' treatment guidance, the data required for antibiograms are scarce in resource-constrained settings and require regular revision due to rapidly evolving rates of AMR. Antibiograms are also unable to provide syndrome-specific estimates of coverage, given their failure to consider the causative pathogens responsible for clinical syndromes – which vary substantially by age group.

To improve the utility of antibiograms and address the limited availability of published susceptibility data, the Weighted Incidence Syndromic Combination Antibiogram (WISCA) methodology has been developed.WISCAs aim to inform the antibacterial coverage of specified antibiotic regimens for a given clinical syndrome, using estimates of both the prevalence of bacterial pathogens causing that syndrome and the antibiotic susceptibility of these pathogens. Bayesian methods are used to calculate a weighted coverage estimate for individual or pre-specified combinations of antibiotics, following pre-identified susceptibility assumptions consistent across the international literature.,

WISCA coverage estimates can inform the proportion of episodes of a given clinical syndrome that would be expected to be treated with specified antibiotic regimens, even without knowledge of the causative pathogen or its specific susceptibility, by incorporating the frequencies of different bacterial pathogens (and their intrinsic resistance patterns) into the model. WISCAs may be particularly helpful for informing the empirical treatment of sepsis and meningitis – where pathogen isolation may be difficult and the consequences of ineffective therapy are high – whilst also providing a tool for antibiotic stewardship, which is of importance in light of increasing global AMR.,

As a demonstration of this approach, we have developed a WISCA for sepsis and meningitis in the paediatric population – the most important causes of neonatal and child mortality globally - in a region with limited surveillance capacity and limited published data. Our objective was to use published data to evaluate the coverage offered by commonly recommended and prescribed antibiotics to treat sepsis and meningitis in children in Southeast Asia and the Pacific: ampicillin, gentamicin, non-antipseudomonal third-generation cephalosporins (ceftriaxone, cefotaxime) and carbapenems. Utilising this strategy, we aim to provide insight and understanding into the likelihood that empirical antibiotic regimens are able to provide effective coverage against serious bacterial infections children in the region. These findings can inform the need for development of new empirical regimens with improved coverage against the pathogens most commonly responsible for sepsis and meningitis in children in the context of increasing AMR.

### An audit of the investigation and initial management of adults presenting with possible bacterial meningitis [^c2a92f52]. The Journal of Infection (2005). Low credibility.

Objectives

This study was carried out to determine local levels of compliance with guidelines from the British Infection Society (BIS) for the early management and investigation of adult patients presenting with possible bacterial meningitis [J Infect 39 (1999) 1; J Infect 46 (2003) 75].

Methods

Patients investigated for possible bacterial meningitis at Wythenshawe Hospital, Manchester were identified retrospectively by a computer search of microbiology requests. The clinical presentation, laboratory investigations and early antibiotic management were reviewed.

Results

Only two of 26 patients who presented over a 9-month period were confirmed to have bacterial meningitis. Basic laboratory investigations were carried out on all patients. Samples for more specific investigations to determine the aetiological agent such as polymerase chain reaction, serology or throat swab culture, were frequently omitted by the clinicians. The choice of antibiotic therapy was generally appropriate for the treatment of bacterial meningitis with large variation in the dosage prescribed. Both patients with confirmed bacterial meningitis received appropriate doses.

Conclusions

Compliance with BIS guidelines was incomplete in a group of patients presenting with possible bacterial meningitis. Access to a simplified outline of recommendations for early investigation and management of adult patients with possible bacterial meningitis may optimise guideline compliance and patient outcome.

Summary

Appropriate early investigation and management of bacterial meningitis in adults can optimise the outcome of this high mortality disease. Guidelines published by the BIS in 1999 detailed the recommended initial management of such patients [J Infect 39 (1999) 1]. In this study, the level of adherence to these guidelines was investigated for patients with possible bacterial meningitis who presented to a hospital in Manchester. The results showed that basic investigations such as peripheral blood count and blood cultures were almost invariably carried out, whereas, more specific investigations such as meningococcal PCR, serology and throat swab were frequently omitted. The choice of antibiotic was in agreement with the guidelines for the majority of cases but highlighted a considerable variability in dosage prescribed. The availability of a simple flow-chart outlining the early management of suspected bacterial meningitis and meningococcal septicaemia in adults produced by the BIS in 2003 may raise awareness of and compliance with their guidelines, thus optimising patient outcome.

### The UK joint specialist societies guideline on the diagnosis and management of acute meningitis and meningococcal sepsis in immunocompetent adults [^e642c2a6]. The Journal of Infection (2016). Low credibility.

Bacterial meningitis and meningococcal sepsis are rare conditions with high case fatality rates. Early recognition and prompt treatment saves lives. In 1999 the British Infection Society produced a consensus statement for the management of immunocompetent adults with meningitis and meningococcal sepsis. Since 1999 there have been many changes. We therefore set out to produce revised guidelines which provide a standardised evidence-based approach to the management of acute community acquired meningitis and meningococcal sepsis in adults. A working party consisting of infectious diseases physicians, neurologists, acute physicians, intensivists, microbiologists, public health experts and patient group representatives was formed. Key questions were identified and the literature reviewed. All recommendations were graded and agreed upon by the working party. The guidelines, which for the first time include viral meningitis, are written in accordance with the AGREE 2 tool and recommendations graded according to the GRADE system. Main changes from the original statement include the indications for pre-hospital antibiotics, timing of the lumbar puncture and the indications for neuroimaging. The list of investigations has been updated and more emphasis is placed on molecular diagnosis. Approaches to both antibiotic and steroid therapy have been revised. Several recommendations have been given regarding the follow-up of patients.

### Bacterial meningitis in Malawian infants [^c0ff2cd5]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2014). Low credibility.

CONCLUSION

Ceftriaxone provides significantly better in vitro coverage than the WHO-recommended combination of penicillin and gentamicin in meningitis in young infants in Blantyre, Malawi where Gram positive isolates predominate. This gap in susceptibility may be even higher in settings where Gram-negative isolates have a larger role. Ceftriaxone's once daily dosing schedule also reduces pressure on nursing staff but resistance is emerging among Gram-negative isolates and the safety profile of ceftriaxone in neonates is yet to be fully confirmed. In view of these results, the WHO recommendations of empirical penicillin and gentamicin for suspected neonatal meningitis should be reevaluated. This is particularly important for those settings where the prevalence of gentamicin resistant Gram-negative meningitis is high.

### Acute bacterial meningitis [^b4b550c0]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

All guidelines recommend patients with suspected ABM should receive parenteral antibiotics within 1 h. However, only 46% of patients in a clinical research study were reported to meet this target, limited by delays in the emergency department. Antibiotic choice should be determined by patient risk group, patient allergies, and local guidelines informed by epidemiology, including antimicrobial resistance. Penicillin resistance in S. pneumoniae is 15–20% in some settings, but remains < 5% in N. meningitidis. However, quinolone resistance in N. meningitidis reaches 70% in Southeast Asia. Diagnostic uncertainty in culture-negative meningitis often leads to prolonged dual antibiotic and antiviral therapies, which may be associated with nosocomial complications.

Adjunctive therapies

Adjunctive treatments are designed to reduce secondary inflammation in ABM and decrease the morbidity associated with CNS tissue damage. Inflammation is associated with secondary complications of ABM, including death, deafness, stroke, epilepsy and learning difficulties. Delayed cerebral thrombosis is a rare complication of ABM that can occur up to 2 weeks post-admission.

In hospitals in high-income settings, patients presenting with suspected pneumococcal meningitis should receive adjunctive dexamethasone to reduce mortality. In low-income settings, dexamethasone is only indicated in cases of suspected S. suis meningitis in Southeast Asia to reduce deafness. In other settings, particularly in Low and Middle Income Countries in Africa, dexamethasone is ineffective and should not be given.

Other previously tested adjuncts, including hypothermia and glycerol, have been shown to be potentially harmful and should not be administered.

### 2017 Infectious Diseases Society of America's clinical practice guidelines for healthcare-associated ventriculitis and meningitis [^0ab6477e]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Medium credibility.

Healthcare-associated ventriculitis and meningitis — empiric therapy and vancomycin targets are specified as follows: In seriously ill adult patients receiving intermittent bolus administration, the vancomycin trough concentration should be maintained at 15–20 µg/mL (strong, low). For patients with anaphylaxis to beta-lactams in whom meropenem is contraindicated, aztreonam or ciprofloxacin is recommended for gram-negative coverage (strong, low), and for those colonized or infected elsewhere with a highly antimicrobial-resistant pathogen, adjusting the empiric regimen to treat for this pathogen is recommended (strong, low). The evidence summary notes likely pathogens with CSF shunt/drain infections and states that empirical therapy with intravenous vancomycin plus cefepime, ceftazidime, or meropenem is appropriate, that serum vancomycin troughs should be maintained between 15 and 20 µg/mL, and that empiric gram-negative choices should reflect local susceptibility patterns.

Table 3.
Overview of Guideline Indications for Cranial Imaging, and Proportion of Patients Fulfilling the Criteria

Empirical antibiotic treatment was started in the emergency department for 72 of 203 patients (35.4%). Antibiotic treatment was initiated for suspected sepsis in 23 patients (31.9%) and for suspected bacterial meningitis in 49 patients (68.1%). The median time between emergency department entry and antibiotic treatment was 136 minutes (IQR 57–258), and the times were similar between patients with and without CT scans (141 minutes [IQR 58–292] vs 134 minutes [IQR 52–227], respectively; MWU P = 0.74; Figure 1); results were also similar when limiting the analysis to those patients treated for suspected bacterial meningitis (MWU P = 0.34). Antibiotic treatments were started prior to CT scans in 11 of 33 (33.3%) patients with suspected bacterial meningitis, and those CT scans were before LPs. Antibiotic treatments were started within 1 hour, according to the ESCMID guideline recommendations, in 14 of 49 (28.6%) patients with suspected bacterial meningitis. The median time to LP was 157 minutes (IQR 103–228) in patients for whom CT scans were not performed, compared to 290 minutes (IQR 191–527) in those for whom CT scans were performed before LP (MWU P < .001). The time to treatment was known for 15 of the 16 patients who were eventually diagnosed with bacterial meningitis, and showed a median time to treatment of 62 minutes (IQR 32–171), which was shorter than for those treated with antibiotics who eventually received another diagnosis, albeit the difference was nonsignificant (median 136 minutes, IQR 65–278; MWU P = 0.09). There were 7 bacterial meningitis patients who were treated within 1 hour (46.7%), in compliance with the ESCMID guidelines.

What therapy is recommended while waiting for the investigation results?

There is considerable clinical overlap between patients with encephalitis, meningitis and septic shock. Therefore, patients are usually prescribed broad-spectrum antibiotics and high-dose aciclovir until test results are available. Because of the severity and the non-specific presentation of neonatal disease, some clinicians start aciclovir in all neonates less than 21 days of age in whom antibiotic therapy is being given empirically for suspected sepsis, although others have cautioned that aciclovir is inappropriately or excessively used in children of all ages.

What is the role of intraventricular antimicrobial therapy — recommendations specify that intraventricular antimicrobial therapy should be considered for healthcare-associated ventriculitis and meningitis that responds poorly to systemic therapy alone, that when given via a ventricular drain the drain should be clamped for 15–60 minutes to allow equilibration throughout the cerebrospinal fluid, and that dosages and intervals should be adjusted based on cerebrospinal fluid antimicrobial concentrations to 10–20 times the minimum inhibitory concentration of the causative microorganism as well as ventricular size and daily drain output; all are graded strong, low.

Recommended treatment

Regarding treatment, 81% of responses stated that rapid administration of antibiotics is necessary. The correct choice of empirical antibiotic treatment, consisting of a third-generation cephalosporin with ampicillin (alternatives: amoxicillin, penicillin G) with or without vancomycin, was provided in 38%, and of those, almost 90% with correct dosing. Another 29% provided an incomplete choice of antibiotic treatment and 33% declined to comment on any choice of antibiotics. In 33% of the sessions, antiviral treatment was considered with approximately half of them providing correct dosing. Dexamethasone administration was recommended in 24% of all responses.

Misleading statements

Misleading statements were identified in 52% of the sessions, such as performing an LP to relieve intracranial pressure or carrying it out prior to imaging in order to facilitate image interpretation; administering prophylactic antiseizure medication or giving benzodiazepines for sedation; adjusting ceftriaxone dosage based on age, weight and kidney function or administering dexamethasone for meningococcal meningitis; the presence of a stiff neck and Kernig's sign (while the vignette stated that these were absent); or the misinterpretation of mastoiditis as herpes zoster ophthalmicus.

### Diagnosis, initial management, and prevention of meningitis [^1594180b]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Although the annual incidence of bacterial meningitis in the United States is declining, it remains a medical emer- gency with a potential for high morbidity and mortality. Clinical signs and symptoms are unreliable in distinguishing bacterial meningitis from the more common forms of aseptic meningitis; therefore, a lumbar puncture with cerebro- spinal fluid analysis is recommended. Empiric antimicrobial therapy based on age and risk factors must be started promptly in patients with bacterial meningitis. Empiric therapy should not be delayed, even if a lumbar puncture cannot be performed because results of a computed tomography scan are pending or because the patient is awaiting transfer. Concomitant therapy with dexamethasone initiated before or at the time of antimicrobial therapy has been demonstrated to improve morbidity and mortality in adults with Streptococcus pneumoniae infection. Within the United States, almost 30 percent of strains of pneumococci, the most common etiologic agent of bacterial meningitis, are not susceptible to penicillin. Among adults in developed countries, the mortality rate from bacterial meningitis is 21 percent. However, the use of conjugate vaccines has reduced the incidence of bacterial meningitis in children and adults.

### Impact of an evidence-based guideline on the management of community-acquired bacterial meningitis: a prospective cohort study [^0016c4ef]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

To study the impact of an evidence-based guideline on the management of community-acquired bacterial meningitis.

Methods

We performed an interrupted time series analysis in a prospective nationwide cohort study from 2006 to 2015. The guideline stresses the importance of cranial imaging before lumbar puncture (LP) in selected patients based on clinical criteria, and early treatment with amoxicillin and a third-generation cephalosporin for adults with suspected community-acquired bacterial meningitis. The guideline was published in April 2013.

Results

We included 1326 episodes before and 210 episodes after guideline introduction. Cranial imaging was performed before LP in 497 (84%) of 591 episodes with clinical criteria warranting computed tomography (CT). The guideline did not improve this (increase of 2%; 95% confidence interval (CI), -15 to 19). Without these criteria, imaging before LP occurred in 606 (67%) of 900 episodes, also without effect of the guideline (increase of 1%; 95% CI, -25 to 28). The estimate of effect of the guideline for treatment with the recommended antibiotic regimen was an increase of 19.5% (95% CI, 13.5 to 25.5), and there was a trend towards more frequent initiation of treatment before CT. There was no association between delay in antibiotic treatment due to imaging before LP and unfavourable outcome (odds ratio, 1.14; 95% CI 0.86 to 1.52).

Conclusions

Cranial imaging is performed before LP in the majority of patients with bacterial meningitis, irrespective of guideline indications. The guideline introduction was associated with a trend towards early initiation of treatment before imaging and with increased adherence to antibiotic policy.

### Empiric antibiotic use and susceptibility in infants with bacterial infections: a multicenter retrospective cohort study [^7db2fd5e]. Hospital Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Objectives

To assess hospital differences in empirical antibiotic use, bacterial epidemiology, and antimicrobial susceptibility for common antibiotic regimens among young infants with urinary tract infection (UTI), bacteremia, or bacterial meningitis.

Methods

We reviewed medical records from infants < 90 days old presenting to 8 US children's hospitals with UTI, bacteremia, or meningitis. We used the Pediatric Health Information System database to identify cases and empirical antibiotic use and medical record review to determine infection, pathogen, and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns. We compared hospital-level differences in antimicrobial use, pathogen, infection site, and antimicrobial susceptibility.

Results

We identified 470 infants with bacterial infections: 362 (77%) with UTI alone and 108 (23%) with meningitis or bacteremia. Infection type did not differ across hospitals (P = 0.85). Empirical antibiotic use varied across hospitals (P < .01), although antimicrobial susceptibility patterns for common empirical regimens were similar. A third-generation cephalosporin would have empirically treated 90% of all ages, 89% in 7- to 28-day-olds, and 91% in 29- to 89-day-olds. The addition of ampicillin would have improved coverage in only 4 cases of bacteremia and meningitis. Ampicillin plus gentamicin would have treated 95%, 89%, and 97% in these age groups, respectively.

Conclusions

Empirical antibiotic use differed across regionally diverse US children's hospitals in infants < 90 days old with UTI, bacteremia, or meningitis. Antimicrobial susceptibility to common antibiotic regimens was similar across hospitals, and adding ampicillin to a third-generation cephalosporin minimally improves coverage. Our findings support incorporating empirical antibiotic recommendations into national guidelines for infants with suspected bacterial infection.

### Progress and challenges in bacterial meningitis: a review [^e6aebb74]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Bacterial meningitis is a worldwide health problem, with incidence rates ranging from approximately 0.9 per 100 000 individuals per year in high-income countries to 80 per 100 000 individuals per year in low-income countries. In low-income countries, bacterial meningitis has a mortality rate of up to 54%. Up to 24% of those who survive develop chronic neurological sequelae, such as hearing loss or focal neurological deficits.

Observations

Streptococcus pneumoniae causes about 72% and Neisseria meningitidis causes about 11% of cases of bacterial meningitis in people older than 16 years. Escherichia coli and Streptococcus agalactiae cause about 35% of cases of early-onset neonatal meningitis. In adults, risk factors for bacterial meningitis include older age and immunosuppressive conditions. The most common symptoms are headache (84%), fever (74%), stiff neck (74%), altered mental status (median [IQR] Glasgow Coma Scale score of 11 [9–14] on a scale ranging from 3–15), and nausea (62%). Brain imaging should be performed before lumbar puncture if patients present with altered mental status, focal neurological deficits, papilledema, or history of immunocompromising conditions or central nervous system disease. Bacterial meningitis should be suspected if any of the following are present on admission: serum leukocytes greater than 10.0 ×109/L, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leukocytes greater than 2000/μL, CSF granulocytes greater than 1180/μL, CSF protein greater than 2.2 g/L, CSF glucose less than 34.23 mg/dL, or fever. A positive Gram stain result for bacteria is diagnostic, but the sensitivity of a positive Gram stain result for bacterial meningitis ranges from 50% to 90%. In countries in which the prevalence of ceftriaxone-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae exceeds 1%, vancomycin and ceftriaxone are the empirical antibiotics of choice, with the addition of ampicillin in neonates, older patients, and immunocompromised patients. Adjunctive dexamethasone should be used in patients with bacterial meningitis but stopped if Listeria monocytogenes is confirmed.

Conclusions and Relevance

Bacterial meningitis affects approximately 0.9 per 100 000 individuals to 80 per 100 000 individuals per year and has a mortality rate as high as 54%. First-line therapy is prompt empirical intravenous antibiotic therapy and adjunctive dexamethasone.

### Adult bacterial meningitis: aetiology, penicillin susceptibility, risk factors, prognostic factors and guidelines for empirical antibiotic treatment [^3824c2c9]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2004). Low credibility.

Episodes of adult bacterial meningitis (ABM) at a Danish hospital in 1991–2000 were identified from the databases of the Department of Clinical Microbiology, and compared with data from the Danish National Patient Register and the Danish National Notification System. Reduced penicillin susceptibility occurred in 21 (23%) of 92 cases of known aetiology, compared to an estimated 6% in nationally notified cases (p < 0.001). Ceftriaxone plus penicillin as empirical treatment was appropriate in 97% of ABM cases in the study population, and in 99.6% of nationally notified cases. The notification rate was 75% for penicillin-susceptible episodes, and 24% for penicillin-non-susceptible episodes (p < 0.001). Cases involving staphylococci, Pseudomonas spp. and Enterobacteriaceae were under-reported. Among 51 ABM cases with no identified risk factors, nine of 11 cases with penicillin-non-susceptible bacteria were community-acquired. Severe sequelae correlated independently with age, penicillin non-susceptibility, mechanical ventilation and non-transferral to a tertiary hospital (p < 0.05; logistic regression). Other factors that correlated with severe sequelae by univariate analysis only were inappropriate clinical handling, abnormal consciousness, convulsions and nosocomial infection. Overall, the data indicated that neither age alone, community-acquired infection nor absence of identified risk factors can predict susceptibility to penicillin accurately. Recommendations for empirical antibiotic treatment for ABM should not be based exclusively on clinical notification systems with possible unbalanced under-reporting.

### Severe community-acquired Streptococcus pneumoniae bacterial meningitis: clinical and prognostic picture from the intensive care unit [^9ed3c016]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

All treatment variables were collected. Empirical treatment was that which was initiated upon clinical suspicion and before microbiological results are available. It was considered de-escalated when, based on the microbiological results, the spectrum or number of antimicrobials was reduced. Also, dosages and duration of the antibiotic treatments were registered. A delay in antibiotic treatment was considered to have occurred if the first dose was administered 6 h or more after hospital admission. Other cutoff points were also assessed. Antibiotic treatment was considered to be appropriate when causative pathogens were susceptible to at least one prescribed antibiotic. Adjuvant therapy with steroids was also recorded. A delay in steroid treatment was considered to have occurred if treatment was not started before or at the same time than antibiotics.

Clinical response was evaluated at 72 h after antibiotic treatment initiation. Patients were considered to be responders if clinical improvement was observed, and all signs and symptoms present at the time of diagnosis had improved or disappeared. Treatment failure was defined as persistence or worsening of the signs and symptoms of infection despite antimicrobial treatment, or death of the patient directly related to the meningitis episode. Microbiologic response and CSF inflammatory parameters were evaluated in those patients for whom a second CSF sample was obtained.

Meningitis complications were identified according to the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases guidelines for bacterial meningitis and collected from medical records. ICU and hospital length of stay and 30-day mortality were also recorded.

Statistical analysis

Categorical variables were summarized as absolute numbers and percentages and analyzed with chi-square or Fisher's exact test when indicated. Continuous variables were reported as mean and standard deviation or median and interquartile range (IQR), depending on their homogeneity, and were compared using Student's t test or the Mann–Whitney U test as appropriate. For all comparisons, values of p ≤ 0.05 were considered statistically significant. A multivariate logistic regression model adjusted by Bonferroni correction was developed to identify the variables associated with patient mortality and early treatment failure. The statistical analysis was performed using the STATA® v.14.2 software.
