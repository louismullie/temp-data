## Question

What are the physiologic benefits of supplementing with NAD+

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the physiologic benefits of supplementing with NAD+ and how to interpret the evidence base. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core biology of NAD+ and why levels decline with age. Then, I should verify which NAD+ precursors are used clinically and their bioavailability. Next, I will examine human trial data by organ system, being careful to separate established effects from exploratory signals. After that, I need to consider safety, dosing, and duration. Finally, I will integrate mechanistic plausibility and outline practical, evidence-informed takeaways with appropriate caveats.

> Let me first confirm the foundational biology so I don't jump to conclusions: NAD+ is both a redox cofactor and a co-substrate for sirtuins, PARPs, and CD38, linking energy metabolism to DNA repair, epigenetics, and stress responses; with aging, NAD+ declines due to increased consumption and impaired salvage, which is mechanistically tied to mitochondrial dysfunction and inflammation, so the rationale for boosting NAD+ is strong but needs clinical validation [^115uMP9H] [^111mNu3G] [^1135muiJ].

> Wait, let me verify the precursor landscape and bioavailability because this shapes expectations: oral NAD+ itself has poor bioavailability, so clinical studies use precursors such as nicotinamide riboside (NR), nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), nicotinamide (NAM), and nicotinic acid (NA); NR and NMN reliably increase blood and some tissue NAD+ metabolites in humans, though magnitude varies by dose, tissue, and assay, and NAM can raise NAD+ but may inhibit sirtuins at high levels, which complicates interpretation of outcomes [^114Hay2o] [^111wmB7v] [^113iBtjg] [^111qYZHb].

> I will now examine cardiovascular effects, since this is where human signals are most consistent; chronic NR at 1000 mg/day for 6 weeks increased PBMC NAD+ by about 60% and reduced systolic blood pressure by roughly 8 mmHg and lowered aortic stiffness (carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity) in healthy middle-aged and older adults, with the magnitude of BP reduction greater in those with higher baseline BP, and these exploratory findings have informed ongoing trials in CKD and PAD, where NR improved 6-minute walk distance in PAD, suggesting clinically meaningful functional gains in ischemic muscle [^111wmB7v] [^116xoGg9] [^111t2uBt] [^114Hq3SN].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about metabolism; in healthy or overweight/obese cohorts without baseline dysfunction, NR and NMN often fail to improve insulin sensitivity or mitochondrial function despite raising NAD+ metabolites, whereas NMN at 250 mg/day for 10 weeks improved muscle insulin sensitivity in postmenopausal women with prediabetes, indicating that baseline metabolic status and phenotype likely determine responsiveness; similarly, NR increased acetylcarnitine and slightly altered body composition in obese adults without changing insulin sensitivity, reinforcing a modest, context-dependent metabolic signal rather than broad efficacy [^111CdTkC] [^1172xkJz] [^114so9Uf].

> Let me consider musculoskeletal outcomes carefully; in older men, 250 mg/day NMN for 12 weeks increased blood NAD+ and produced nominally significant improvements in gait speed and grip strength, but a separate analysis highlighted methodological limitations and the need for replication, while a recent mouse model showed that even severe muscle NAD+ depletion did not impair contractile function or accelerate aging, cautioning against assuming that raising NAD+ will universally improve muscle performance in humans without targeted deficits [^113rKxc2] [^115qoo58] [^113UKzbL].

> Next, I should review neurocognitive and neurodegenerative data; in Parkinson's disease, 1000 mg/day NR for 30 days safely increased cerebral NAD+ and altered cerebral metabolism with a trend toward clinical improvement and downregulation of inflammatory markers, supporting neuroprotection as a plausible target, but larger, longer trials are needed; for Alzheimer's disease, preliminary human data with NR show biomarker and cognitive signals, but again, these are early and not definitive for disease modification [^115acmvM] [^116hD21f].

> I need to check systemic and immunometabolic effects; a systems-based oral supplement targeting NAMPT activation and NNMT inhibition increased whole-blood NAD+, SIRT1, and reduced proinflammatory cytokines with a shift in IgG glycosylation toward a younger profile, suggesting that addressing pathway bottlenecks may yield broader physiologic changes than precursor-only strategies, though this requires replication and head-to-head trials [^115wyyv1] [^11263wKN].

> But wait, what about safety and tolerability; across multiple human studies, NR and NMN are generally well tolerated at commonly used doses (NR up to 1000–2000 mg/day, NMN up to 900 mg/day) with transient flushing or GI upset in a minority, and no consistent signal for serious adverse events; however, long-term safety beyond 6–12 months remains limited, and high-dose regimens should be approached cautiously until larger, longer trials are completed [^115HskPw] [^1164XCsB] [^117UqRDz].

> Let me synthesize the strength of evidence by domain so I don't overstate claims: strong signals exist for vascular function (reduced arterial stiffness and modest BP lowering with NR), moderate signals for muscle function in older adults with NMN, preliminary but promising signals in PD and AD, and inconsistent or null effects on insulin sensitivity and mitochondrial function in healthy cohorts; importantly, benefits appear more likely when baseline NAD+ flux is impaired or when multi-target strategies are used, aligning with the concept that precursor supply alone may be insufficient if salvage capacity is constrained [^116xoGg9] [^113rKxc2] [^115acmvM] [^115wyyv1].

> I should double-check mechanistic plausibility to ensure coherence: boosting NAD+ can enhance sirtuin activity, support PARP-mediated DNA repair, and modulate CD38-driven calcium signaling and inflammation; preclinical work consistently shows improved mitochondrial biogenesis, stress responses, and mitophagy, but human translation is uneven, likely reflecting tissue-specific NAD+ metabolism, baseline NAD+ status, and the need for adequate duration and dosing to engage these pathways meaningfully [^115uMP9H] [^115rUz9s] [^113H4xby].

> Finally, I need to translate this into practical guidance with appropriate caveats: for adults over 40 or those with cardiometabolic risk, a 6–12 week trial of NR 1000 mg/day or NMN 250–500 mg/day is reasonable to consider, with attention to BP, energy, and mobility outcomes; for neurodegenerative risk or symptoms, participation in clinical trials is preferable given early-stage evidence; for healthy individuals without deficits, routine supplementation is not clearly beneficial, and lifestyle strategies (caloric restriction, exercise, sleep) remain first-line for supporting NAD+ homeostasis; in all cases, prioritize products with third-party testing and discuss with a clinician, especially if combining with other supplements or medications [^115HskPw] [^113rKxc2] [^115uMP9H] [^1156aKU3].

NAD+ supplementation offers **modest physiologic benefits** in humans, including increased NAD+ levels [^111wmB7v], modest reductions in blood pressure and arterial stiffness [^116xoGg9], and small improvements in muscle strength and gait speed in older adults [^113rKxc2]. However, **most clinical trials show limited or no effects** on insulin sensitivity, mitochondrial function, or metabolic health in healthy or obese individuals [^111CdTkC] [^114so9Uf], and long-term safety data are lacking [^1156aKU3]. Benefits appear **context-dependent**, with stronger signals in older adults or those with baseline deficits, but overall evidence remains preliminary and inconsistent [^115mfFKC].

## Physiological benefits supported by clinical evidence

Key findings from human trials:

| **Physiological benefit** | **Evidence summary** | **Clinical significance** |
|-|-|-|
| Increased NAD+ levels | - NR and NMN reliably raise blood NAD+ metabolites [^111wmB7v] [^113iBtjg] <br/> - Magnitude varies by dose, duration, and tissue [^11263wKN] | Confirmed bioavailability; clinical relevance depends on downstream effects |
| Reduced blood pressure and arterial stiffness | - NR 1,000 mg/day for 6 weeks reduced SBP by ~8 mmHg and aortic stiffness in older adults [^116xoGg9] <br/> - Effects larger in those with higher baseline BP [^115HskPw] | Modest but clinically meaningful cardiovascular risk reduction |
| Improved muscle function | - NMN 250 mg/day for 12 weeks improved gait speed and grip strength in older men [^113rKxc2] <br/> - NR increased acetylcarnitine and altered muscle metabolism in obesity [^111CdTkC] | Small-to-moderate functional gains; relevance to sarcopenia needs confirmation |
| Anti-inflammatory effects | - NR reduced inflammatory cytokines in PD and ALS trials [^115acmvM] <br/> - Systems approaches (NT) lowered IL-2 and shifted IgG glycosylation [^115wyyv1] | Suggests immunometabolic modulation; clinical impact unclear |

---

## Limitations and inconsistencies in clinical evidence

- **Small sample sizes**: Most trials enroll 10–50 participants, limiting power and generalizability [^1156aKU3].
- **Short duration**: Interventions typically last 6–12 weeks, so long-term benefits and safety remain uncertain [^1156aKU3].
- **Heterogeneous outcomes**: Variable NAD+ assays, tissues, and endpoints complicate cross-trial comparisons [^11263wKN].
- **Null findings**: Many studies show no change in insulin sensitivity, mitochondrial function, or metabolic flexibility despite NAD+ increases [^111CdTkC] [^114so9Uf].

---

## Safety and tolerability

NR and NMN are **generally well tolerated** at doses up to 1,000–2,000 mg/day, with mild GI upset or flushing in some studies [^115HskPw] [^1164XCsB]. No serious adverse events have been reported in short-term trials, but **long-term safety data are lacking** [^1156aKU3].

---

## Comparison with other NAD+ precursors

| **Precursor** | **Clinical evidence** | **Key findings** |
|-|-|-|
| NR | Extensive human data | - Increases NAD+ [^111wmB7v] <br/> - Modest BP/stiffness effects [^116xoGg9] <br/> - Limited metabolic effects [^111CdTkC] |
| NMN | Growing human data | - Increases NAD+ [^113iBtjg] <br/> - Improves muscle function in older adults [^113rKxc2] <br/> - Minimal metabolic effects in healthy cohorts |
| NAM | Limited modern trials | - Raises NAD+ <br/> - May inhibit sirtuins <br/> - Unclear net benefit [^111qYZHb] |
| NA | Minimal recent data | - Raises NAD+ <br/> - Flushing limits use <br/> - Limited modern trials |

---

## Current research gaps and future directions

- **Long-term safety**: Trials beyond 6–12 months are needed [^1156aKU3].
- **Dose optimization**: Optimal dosing by age, sex, and health status is unclear [^1156aKU3].
- **Tissue specificity**: Better tools to measure tissue NAD+ and mitochondrial function are needed [^113H4xby].
- **Combination strategies**: Targeting NAD+ consumption (e.g. CD38 inhibition) may enhance efficacy [^114Hay2o].

---

NAD+ supplementation **modestly increases NAD+ levels** and may improve vascular function and muscle strength in older adults, but **evidence for broad metabolic benefits remains limited and inconsistent**. Larger, longer, and better-controlled trials are needed to define clinical indications, dosing, and safety.

Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD +) has emerged as a critical co-substrate for enzymes involved in the beneficial effects of regular calorie restriction on healthspan. As such, the use of NAD + precursors to augment NAD + bioavailability has been proposed as a strategy for improving cardiovascular and other physiological functions with aging in humans. Here we provide the evidence in a 2×6-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover clinical trial that chronic supplementation with the NAD + precursor vitamin, nicotinamide riboside (NR), is well tolerated and effectively stimulates NAD + metabolism in healthy middle-aged and older adults. Our results also provide initial insight into the effects of chronic NR supplementation on physiological function in humans, and suggest that, in particular, future clinical trials should further assess the potential benefits of NR for reducing blood pressure and arterial stiffness in this group.

### NADprecursor supplementation in human ageing: clinical evidence and challenges [^115mfFKC]. Nature Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD +) is an essential molecule involved in cellular metabolism, and its decline has been implicated in ageing and age-related disorders. However, evidence for an age-related decline in NAD + levels in humans has been consistently observed only in a limited number of studies. Similarly, although preclinical studies support the idea that supplementation with NAD + precursors is a promising therapeutic strategy to promote healthy ageing, human clinical trials have shown limited efficacy. Therefore, an increasing understanding of how NAD + metabolism is affected in different tissues during disease and following NAD + precursor supplementation is crucial to defining the therapeutic value of NAD + -targeted therapies. In this Review, we evaluate the clinical evidence supporting the notion that NAD + levels decline with age, as well as the tissue-specific effects of NAD + precursor supplementation. Viewed in perspective, the published body of data on NAD + dynamics in human tissues remains sparse, and the extrapolation of rodent-based data is not straightforward, underscoring the need for more clinical studies to gain deeper insights into systemic and tissue-specific NAD + metabolism.

### Therapeutic potential of NAD-boosting molecules: the in Vivo evidence [^111hmSbp]. Cell Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD), the cell's hydrogen carrier for redox enzymes, is well known for its role in redox reactions. More recently, it has emerged as a signaling molecule. By modulating NAD + -sensing enzymes, NAD + controls hundreds of key processes from energy metabolism to cell survival, rising and falling depending on food intake, exercise, and the time of day. NAD + levels steadily decline with age, resulting in altered metabolism and increased disease susceptibility. Restoration of NAD + levels in old or diseased animals can promote health and extend lifespan, prompting a search for safe and efficacious NAD-boosting molecules that hold the promise of increasing the body's resilience, not just to one disease, but to many, thereby extending healthy human lifespan.

### Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide in aging biology: potential applications and many unknowns [^1133EbhR]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Recent research has unveiled an expansive role of NAD+ in cellular energy generation, redox reactions, and as a substrate or cosubstrate in signaling pathways that regulate health span and aging. This review provides a critical appraisal of the clinical pharmacology and the preclinical and clinical evidence for therapeutic effects of NAD+ precursors for age-related conditions, with a particular focus on cardiometabolic disorders, and discusses gaps in current knowledge. NAD+ levels decrease throughout life; age-related decline in NAD+ bioavailability has been postulated to be a contributor to many age-related diseases. Raising NAD+ levels in model organisms by administration of NAD+ precursors improves glucose and lipid metabolism; attenuates diet-induced weight gain, diabetes, diabetic kidney disease, and hepatic steatosis; reduces endothelial dysfunction; protects heart from ischemic injury; improves left ventricular function in models of heart failure; attenuates cerebrovascular and neurodegenerative disorders; and increases health span. Early human studies show that NAD+ levels can be raised safely in blood and some tissues by oral NAD+ precursors and suggest benefit in preventing nonmelanotic skin cancer, modestly reducing blood pressure and improving lipid profile in older adults with obesity or overweight; preventing kidney injury in at-risk patients; and suppressing inflammation in Parkinson disease and SARS-CoV-2 infection. Clinical pharmacology, metabolism, and therapeutic mechanisms of NAD+ precursors remain incompletely understood. We suggest that these early findings provide the rationale for adequately powered randomized trials to evaluate the efficacy of NAD+ augmentation as a therapeutic strategy to prevent and treat metabolic disorders and age-related conditions.

### NADMetabolism in cardiac health, aging, and disease [^114yQdgP]. Circulation (2021). Medium credibility.

Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD +) is a central metabolite involved in energy and redox homeostasis as well as in DNA repair and protein deacetylation reactions. Pharmacological or genetic inhibition of NAD + -degrading enzymes, external supplementation of NAD + precursors, and transgenic overexpression of NAD + -generating enzymes have wide positive effects on metabolic health and age-associated diseases. NAD + pools tend to decline with normal aging, obesity, and hypertension, which are all major risk factors for cardiovascular disease, and NAD + replenishment extends healthspan, avoids metabolic syndrome, and reduces blood pressure in preclinical models. In addition, experimental elevation of NAD + improves atherosclerosis, ischemic, diabetic, arrhythmogenic, hypertrophic, or dilated cardiomyopathies, as well as different modalities of heart failure. Here, we critically discuss cardiomyocyte-specific circuitries of NAD + metabolism, comparatively evaluate distinct NAD + precursors for their preclinical efficacy, and raise outstanding questions on the optimal design of clinical trials in which NAD + replenishment or supraphysiological NAD + elevations are assessed for the prevention or treatment of major cardiac diseases. We surmise that patients with hitherto intractable cardiac diseases such as heart failure with preserved ejection fraction may profit from the administration of NAD + precursors. The development of such NAD + -centered treatments will rely on technological and conceptual progress on the fine regulation of NAD + metabolism.

### The role of NADmetabolism and its modulation of mitochondria in aging and disease [^11251BbE]. Npj Metabolic Health and Disease. (2025). Medium credibility.

Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD +) is a coenzyme involved in a plethora of physiological reactions, with a key relevance in supporting mitochondrial function. Due to its critical role in these cellular processes, declining levels of NAD + are associated with general aging and chronic disorders, including cognitive decline, sarcopenia, and metabolic diseases. These conditions are also typified by loss of mitochondrial health through dysfunction of homeostatic components such as mitophagy, unfolded protein response, and the antioxidant system. Therefore, raising cellular NAD + through vitamin B3 family precursors or via drug-based interventions has become a broadly used strategy to restore mitochondrial and organismal homeostasis, with NAD + precursors becoming a popular supplementation approach. As increasing components of the NAD + biology are unraveled, this comprehensive review summarizes the advances in mechanisms of NAD + metabolism and its modulation via compound-based strategies. Furthermore, it highlights the role of NAD + in mitochondrial homeostasis in aging and disease conditions, the latest results of NAD + -boosting therapeutics in clinical trials, and areas of further translational development.

### NADream: effects of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide supplementation on sleep quality in healthy individuals (NADream) [^116BZwV3]. ClinicalTrials (2025). Medium credibility.

Study Overview Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide is important for regulating cellular energy metabolism, mitochondrial function, and circadian rhythms, which are key processes involved in the sleep-wake cycle and sleep regulation. Nicotinamide riboside supplementation has been shown to elevate NAD+ levels in humans. Higher NAD+ levels may support better sleep by restoration of mitochondrial efficiency and reducing oxidative stress. As people age, there is evidence of a decline in NAD+ levels, which may lead to mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and disruptions in circadian rhythms. These changes can negatively affect sleep architecture and reduce sleep quality. Impaired NAD+ metabolism has been linked to problems with the molecular clock, which regulates circadian timing through effects on sirtuin activity and clock genes such as BMAL1.

NAD+ also supports brain metabolism by maintaining mitochondrial function, promoting neuroprotection, regulating redox balance, and reducing neuroinflammation. By restoring NAD+ levels, NR supplementation may help improve mitochondrial efficiency, decrease oxidative damage, and enhance sleep-related cellular maintenance. NR may also support synchronization of circadian rhythms, further promoting healthy sleep. Its effects also include modulating neuroinflammatory pathways and strengthening cellular resilience against oxidative stress, both of which are essential for maintaining cognitive functions and neural plasticity during sleep. The NADream study will test whether NR supplementation can improve both objective and subjective measures of sleep in healthy adults. Sleep will be assessed using polysomnography, the gold standard for objective sleep measurement, along with actigraphy, Somnofy sleep monitoring, and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index.

This study will be a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group design. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive ether NR or a placebo for 8 weeks. The findings from this study will help determine whether NR supplementation could be a viable therapeutic option to explore further in this area.

Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD +) is a ubiquitous metabolite that serves an essential role in the catabolism of nutrients. Recently, there has been a surge of interest in NAD + biology, with the recognition that NAD + influences many biological processes beyond metabolism, including transcription, signalling and cell survival. There are a multitude of pathways involved in the synthesis and breakdown of NAD +, and alterations in NAD + homeostasis have emerged as a common feature of a range of disease states. Here, we provide an overview of NAD + metabolism and summarise progress on the development of NAD + -related therapeutics.

Introduction

Advancing age is the primary risk factor for the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD), which remains the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in industrial and post-industrial societies. The increase in CVD risk with aging is driven largely by adverse changes to arteries, including stiffening of the aorta, and by increases in systolic blood pressure. As such, interventions designed to lower blood pressure and/or improve arterial function hold promise for preventing age-related CVD.

Chronic calorie restriction (CR) prevents the development of arterial dysfunction and increases in blood pressure with aging in rodents, and lowers arterial stiffness and blood pressure in overweight-obese middle-aged and older adults. Despite numerous health benefits, adherence to chronic CR remains poor and possibly even unsafe in normal weight older adults –. As such, there is a critical need to establish safe, practical alternatives to regular CR for enhancing cardiovascular function and health with aging in humans.

The recent identification of several key molecular mechanisms responsible for CR-mediated longevity in model organisms has led to an exciting search for "CR-mimetic" interventions to improve cardiovascular and other physiological functions with aging. In this regard, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD +) has emerged as a critical signaling molecule and essential substrate for sirtuins, a class of enzymes that mediate several of the beneficial effects of CR in model organisms, including the maintenance of cardiovascular function. Moreover, CR has been shown to increase NAD + levels in pre-clinical models. The cellular bioavailability of NAD + and related metabolites declines in animals and in humans during normal aging,– and may contribute to physiological aging by reducing sirtuin activity. Although NAD + can be synthesized de novo from the amino acid tryptophan, this process does not occur in all tissues, requiring most cells to rely on a salvage pathway for regenerating NAD + from other intracellular intermediates, which are primarily made available through dietary sources. Vitamin B 3 (niacin: i.e. nicotinic acid and nicotinamide) enters this salvage pathway and acts as a NAD + precursor; however, nicotinic acid is associated with undesirable flushing at therapeutic dosesand nicotinamide does not reliably activate (and may even inhibit) sirtuins despite raising concentrations of NAD + –. Therefore, administration of nicotinic acid or nicotinamide is unlikely to be widely adopted for maintaining health and function with aging.

### Muscle needs NAD, but how much? [^113pFnMV]. Cell Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Supplements that increase nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) have become increasingly popular, and much of the attention has focused on potential benefits to skeletal muscle. In this issue of Cell Metabolism, Chubanava et al. 1 use an inducible model to lower NAD concentration in the muscles of adult mice, revealing a surprising lack of functional consequences.

### Chronic nicotinamide mononucleotide supplementation elevates blood nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide levels and alters muscle function in healthy older men [^113rKxc2]. Npj Aging (2022). Medium credibility.

Preclinical studies have revealed that the elevation of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) upon the administration of nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), an NAD+precursor, can mitigate aging-related disorders; however, human data on this are limited. We investigated whether the chronic oral supplementation of NMN can elevate blood NAD+levels and alter physiological dysfunctions in healthy older participants. We administered 250mg NMN per day to aged men for 6 or 12 weeks in a placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group trial. Chronic NMN supplementation was well tolerated and caused no significant deleterious effect. Metabolomic analysis of whole blood samples demonstrated that oral NMN supplementation significantly increased the NAD+and NAD+metabolite concentrations. There were nominally significant improvements in gait speed and performance in the left grip test, which should be validated in larger studies; however, NMN exerted no significant effect on body composition. Therefore, chronic oral NMN supplementation can be an efficient NAD+booster for preventing aging-related muscle dysfunctions in humans.

### NADhomeostasis in health and disease [^115uMP9H]. Nature Metabolism (2020). High credibility.

The conceptual evolution of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD +) from being seen as a simple metabolic cofactor to a pivotal cosubstrate for proteins regulating metabolism and longevity, including the sirtuin family of protein deacylases, has led to a new wave of scientific interest in NAD +. NAD + levels decline during ageing, and alterations in NAD + homeostasis can be found in virtually all age-related diseases, including neurodegeneration, diabetes and cancer. In preclinical settings, various strategies to increase NAD + levels have shown beneficial effects, thus starting a competitive race to discover marketable NAD + boosters to improve healthspan and lifespan. Here, we review the basics of NAD + biochemistry and metabolism, and its roles in health and disease, and we discuss current challenges and the future translational potential of NAD + research.

### Role of NADand mitochondrial sirtuins in cardiac and renal diseases [^116HtYcE]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2017). Medium credibility.

The coenzyme nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD +) has key roles in the regulation of redox status and energy metabolism. NAD + depletion is emerging as a major contributor to the pathogenesis of cardiac and renal diseases and NAD + repletion strategies have shown therapeutic potential as a means to restore healthy metabolism and physiological function. The pleotropic roles of NAD + enable several possible avenues by which repletion of this coenzyme could have therapeutic efficacy. In particular, NAD + functions as a co-substrate in deacylation reactions carried out by the sirtuin family of enzymes. These NAD + -dependent deacylases control several aspects of metabolism and a wealth of data suggests that boosting sirtuin activity via NAD + supplementation might be a promising therapy for cardiac and renal pathologies. This Review summarizes the role of NAD + metabolism in the heart and kidney, and highlights the mitochondrial sirtuins as mediators of some of the beneficial effects of NAD + -boosting therapies in preclinical animal models. We surmise that modulating the NAD + -sirtuin axis is a clinically relevant approach to develop new therapies for cardiac and renal diseases.

METHODS TO RESTORE NAD+

The evidence demonstrates that the biology behind NAD+ decline is complex. NAD+ restoration using pure exogenous NAD+ is often not practical due to its unstable nature and poor bioavailability to most cell types, so efforts have focused on oral supplementation with the NAD+ precursor compounds nicotinamide (NAM), nicotinamide riboside (NR), and nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN). These precursors are utilized by NAD+ biosynthesis pathways and converted to NAD+ within the cell. However, it is now clear that this popular approach ignores the root causes of NAD+ decline meaning supplementation with precursors alone such as NR or NMN do not offer a long-term efficacious solution for NAD+ restoration. Instead, strategies that simultaneously address the multiple root causes of NAD+ decline such as the combined administration of a NAD+ precursor, a CD38 inhibitor, and an NAMPT activator, hold potential for NAD+ restoration with greater measurable benefits (Fig. 3). Furthermore, there is already a wealth of evidence to support these targets as interventions to successfully restore cellular NAD+ levels and multiple safe and well-tolerated active ingredients against these targets already exist. This presents the opportunity for the development of oral, topical, and injectable formulations, allowing for both whole-body NAD+-restoring benefits alongside more targeted administration, resulting in the ultimate inside-outside approach to aging (Table 2).

Table 2.
Potential Clinical Applications, Routes of Administration and Benefits of NAD+-Restoration Therapies

Fig. 3.
Successful NAD+ restoration requires a multitargeted strategy that simultaneously addresses the root causes of NAD+ decline. Therapies must reduce the excessive consumption of NAD+ with approaches such as CD38 inhibition and reduction of DNA damage, while improving the efficiency of NAD+ recycling by promoting upregulation of the rate-limiting salvage pathway enzyme NAMPT and inhibition of NNMT, an enzyme that promotes the removal of NAD+ breakdown products from the cell rather than recycling.

### Chronic nicotinamide mononucleotide supplementation elevates blood nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide levels and alters muscle function in healthy older men [^116vwJ2E]. Npj Aging (2022). Medium credibility.

Preclinical studies have revealed that the elevation of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD +) upon the administration of nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), an NAD + precursor, can mitigate aging-related disorders; however, human data on this are limited. We investigated whether the chronic oral supplementation of NMN can elevate blood NAD + levels and alter physiological dysfunctions in healthy older participants. We administered 250 mg NMN per day to aged men for 6 or 12 weeks in a placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group trial. Chronic NMN supplementation was well tolerated and caused no significant deleterious effect. Metabolomic analysis of whole blood samples demonstrated that oral NMN supplementation significantly increased the NAD + and NAD + metabolite concentrations. There were nominally significant improvements in gait speed and performance in the left grip test, which should be validated in larger studies; however, NMN exerted no significant effect on body composition. Therefore, chronic oral NMN supplementation can be an efficient NAD + booster for preventing aging-related muscle dysfunctions in humans.

### Supplementation with NAD + precursors for treating Alzheimer's disease: a metabolic approach [^116hD21f]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurocognitive disorder. There is no cure for AD. Maintenance on intracellular levels of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) has been reported to be a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of AD. NAD+ precursors that represent candidate targets include nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) and nicotinamide riboside (NR).

Objective

This systematic review provides insights into the potential therapeutic value of NAD+ precursors including NMN and NR, for the treatment of AD using preclinical and clinical studies published in the last 5 years.

Methods

The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) protocol was followed to systematically search the literature using two databases.

Results

We found 3 studies that used NMN to treat AD in preclinical murine models. However, human clinical trials using NMN as a therapeutic intervention in AD was not available in the current literature. We also found 4 studies that investigated the potential benefits of NR for the treatment of AD in preclinical models. We also found 2 human clinical trials that showed marked improvements in plasma and neuroimaging biomarkers, and cognitive measures following supplementation with NR.

Conclusions

Results of preclinical and clinical studies confirm the potential benefits of NAD+ precursors for the treatment of AD. However, further clinical studies are required to confirm the increasingly important value of NAD+ precursors as effective pharmacological interventions in the clinic.

NAD+ boosters

Nicotinamide adenosine dinucleotide (NAD+) is structurally comprised of two covalently joined mononucleotides (nicotinamide mononucleotide or NMN, and AMP), and has its core function as an enzyme cofactor that mediates hydrogen transfer in oxidative or reductive metabolic reactions. In addition, NAD+ serves as an ADP ribose donor for PARPs that are involved in DNA damage sensing and chromatin opening to initiate repair, and it is required for the histone deacetylase activity of sirtuins to boost peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC1α)-dependent mitochondrial biogenesis and expression of the protective genes implicated in mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPR MT). Thus, DNA repair competes for NAD+ depots with mitochondrial quality control mechanisms, and this competition is especially critical during aging when DNA damage increases, and mitochondrial damage increases too. In addition, NAD+ synthesis declines with age leading to NAD+ exhaustion, with up to ∼40% drop in levels detected for example in the aging mouse brain, and direct negative impact on energy metabolism in aging. With the discovery that organismal NAD+ levels can be improved by dietary supplementation of its precursors like nicotinamide riboside (NR) or NMN, NAD+ boosting became an attractive intervention for healthy aging. Recent studies indeed show that NAD+ repletion has a potential to improve health during aging, with positive effects seen in animal models of diverse aging-associated diseases ranging from cardio-vascular disease to cognitive decline. While improvements of health with NAD+ boosters are seen across organisms, their ability to extend lifespan has been most clearly demonstrated in C. elegans by using NAD+ precursor NR, and NAD+ precursor NAM improved aspects of healthspan but not lifespan in mice. The discrepancy may be due to higher complexity of the mouse system compared to the worm, making life extension more complicated to achieve, but it is also plausible that the kind of NAD+ booster used plays a role, with some drugs being purer and more effective than others. In all cases however the improvement of mitochondrial biogenesis, mitochondrial health and energy metabolism by NAD+ boosters was found to be the key driver of their positive impact. Notably, the reinvigorating effect of NR and NMN on mitochondria is not limited by aging, with even late life treatments showing benefits –. In our view, this is because NAD+ boosting (a) targets the deficit, which is relevant in the aged cohort (e.g. NAD+ exhaustion and associated decline of mitochondrial resilience) and (b) it targets mitochondrial homeostasis very directly at the respective gene expression level without involvement of intermittent adaptive mechanisms that are instead required for connecting interventions like DR and exercise to the same mitochondrial responses. NAD+ boosters are thus promising enhancers of energy metabolism and ATP synthesis at old age.

CLINICAL BENEFITS OF NAD+ RESTORATION

These impressive preclinical results have now shifted the focus to human clinical trials with the hope of translating the benefits of NAD+ restoration to humans (see Table, Supplemental Digital Content 1, which shows human clinical trials that have measured NAD+ levels and clinical outcomes after NAD+ restoration). Notable observations so far include a trend towards an improvement in indicators of cardiovascular function including lower systolic blood pressure and aortic stiffness, a promising reduction in the levels of circulating inflammatory cytokines in older males after only 3 weeks of NAD+ restorationand an NAD+-associated increase in mitochondrial function and decreased proinflammatory factors in heart failure patients. The diverse protective and regenerative capacity of NAD+ has been attributed to its involvement in the prevention of multiple hallmarks of cellular aging (Table 1).

### Chronic nicotinamide riboside supplementation is well-tolerated and elevates NADin healthy middle-aged and older adults [^116Eycah]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

In contrast to these compounds, oral supplementation with either of the NAD + metabolites, nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) or nicotinamide riboside (NR), increases levels of NAD + and improves multiple physiological functions in animal models. Indeed, we recently demonstrated that supplementation of NMN in the drinking water improved cardiovascular function in old mice. Moreover, CR increases concentrations of NR and NAD + and restores normal circadian gene transcription in the liver, further suggesting that NR may act as a CR mimetic. Thus, NMN and NR are NAD + boosting compounds that hold promise for enhancing cardiovascular health and physiological function with aging.

Despite these encouraging results from preclinical studies, the tolerability and effectiveness of chronic supplementation with NMN or NR have not been established in humans. Because NR is readily taken up by cells and acts as a direct vitamin precursor for NAD + synthesis, its recent development as a dietary ingredient (NIAGEN ®, ChromaDex Inc. Irvine, CA) has provided the first opportunity to translate the potential benefits of NAD + boosting molecules to people. In this regard, a recent study showed that single doses of NR stimulated blood cellular NAD + metabolism in healthy humans in a dose-dependent manner. However, the tolerability of chronic NR supplementation and its efficacy for increasing NAD + bioavailability have not been established in humans, and we lack even initial insight into the potential of NR for improving cardiovascular and other physiological functions with human aging.

To address these important research gaps, we conducted a small randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover clinical trial of NR supplementation (500 mg, 2×/day) to assess its overall tolerability and efficacy vs. placebo for raising levels of NAD + -related metabolites in healthy middle-aged and older men and women. We also took the opportunity to gain preliminary insight into the effects of chronic NR supplementation for improving cardiovascular and other physiological functions associated with risk of clinical diseases and/or disability with aging. Our results demonstrate that 6 weeks of NR supplementation at this dose is well-tolerated in humans and effectively increases blood cellular NAD + concentrations. Exploratory analyses of the effects of chronic NR supplementation on physiological function in this cohort of healthy middle-aged and older adults suggest that the potential for reducing systolic blood pressure and arterial stiffness may be the most promising hypotheses to investigate in future larger-scale clinical trials, particularly in individuals with elevated baseline blood pressure.

### Chronic nicotinamide mononucleotide supplementation elevates blood nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide levels and alters muscle function in healthy older men [^116mrhc7]. Npj Aging (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Aging is a risk factor for diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and neurological diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, and the suppression of physiological decline in aging is an important approach to prevent aging-related diseases.

Aging- and age-related diseases have been shown to be closely related to decreased NAD + levels. In animal studies, the administration of intermediate NAD + metabolites, such as nicotinamide (NAM), nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), or nicotinamide riboside (NR), has been shown to increase NAD + concentrations, which helped improve the health and extend the lifespan of the experimental animals –. Thus, the potential of intermediate NAD + metabolites in improving tissue rejuvenation in humans has led to multiple clinical trials on NR and NMN.

NR, a vitamin B3 analog, is a major vitamin component present in milk (~1 mg/L). NMN is present in foods such as edamame, broccoli, and meat (~1 mg/100 g food). However, owing to their extremely low concentrations in foods, it is difficult to obtain these components in sufficient quantity from food. Therefore, purified and concentrated NR and NMN have been used in clinical trials.

### Nicotinamide improves aspects of healthspan, but not lifespan, in mice [^112GhPVE]. Cell Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

The role in longevity and healthspan of nicotinamide (NAM), the physiological precursor of NAD +, is elusive. Here, we report that chronic NAM supplementation improves healthspan measures in mice without extending lifespan. Untargeted metabolite profiling of the liver and metabolic flux analysis of liver-derived cells revealed NAM-mediated improvement in glucose homeostasis in mice on a high-fat diet (HFD) that was associated with reduced hepatic steatosis and inflammation concomitant with increased glycogen deposition and flux through the pentose phosphate and glycolytic pathways. Targeted NAD metabolome analysis in liver revealed depressed expression of NAM salvage in NAM-treated mice, an effect counteracted by higher expression of de novo NAD biosynthetic enzymes. Although neither hepatic NAD + nor NADP + was boosted by NAM, acetylation of some SIRT1 targets was enhanced by NAM supplementation in a diet- and NAM dose-dependent manner. Collectively, our results show health improvement in NAM-supplemented HFD-fed mice in the absence of survival effects.

### Emerging strategies, applications and challenges of targeting NADin the clinic [^1156aKU3]. Nature Aging (2025). High credibility.

Beyond their classical functions as redox cofactors, recent fundamental and clinical research has expanded our understanding of the diverse roles of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP) in signaling pathways, epigenetic regulation and energy homeostasis. Moreover, NAD and NADP influence numerous diseases as well as the processes of aging, and are emerging as targets for clinical intervention. Here, we summarize safety, bioavailability and efficacy data from NAD + -related clinical trials, focusing on aging and neurodegenerative diseases. We discuss the established NAD + precursors nicotinic acid and nicotinamide, newer compounds such as nicotinamide riboside and nicotinamide mononucleotide, and emerging precursors. We also discuss technological advances including in industrial-scale production and real-time detection, which are facilitating NAD + research and clinical translation. Finally, we emphasize the need for further large-scale studies to determine optimal dose, administration routes and frequency, as well as long-term safety and interindividual variability in response.

### Long-term administration of nicotinamide mononucleotide mitigates age-associated physiological decline in mice [^116fH18v]. Cell Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

NAD + availability decreases with age and in certain disease conditions. Nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), a key NAD + intermediate, has been shown to enhance NAD + biosynthesis and ameliorate various pathologies in mouse disease models. In this study, we conducted a 12-month-long NMN administration to regular chow-fed wild-type C57BL/6N mice during their normal aging. Orally administered NMN was quickly utilized to synthesize NAD + in tissues. Remarkably, NMN effectively mitigates age-associated physiological decline in mice. Without any obvious toxicity or deleterious effects, NMN suppressed age-associated body weight gain, enhanced energy metabolism, promoted physical activity, improved insulin sensitivity and plasma lipid profile, and ameliorated eye function and other pathophysiologies. Consistent with these phenotypes, NMN prevented age-associated gene expression changes in key metabolic organs and enhanced mitochondrial oxidative metabolism and mitonuclear protein imbalance in skeletal muscle. These effects of NMN highlight the preventive and therapeutic potential of NAD + intermediates as effective anti-aging interventions in humans.

### The role of NADmetabolism and its modulation of mitochondria in aging and disease [^113H4xby]. Npj Metabolic Health and Disease. (2025). Medium credibility.

The vast number of preclinical studies on NAD + modulation via precursors or modulators of NADase enzymes has established a tight functional relationship between NAD + metabolism and mitochondrial homeostasis. Furthermore, it has emerged that supporting or inducing mitochondrial bioenergetics, stress responses, mitophagy, and other adaptation mechanisms is critical to mediate some of the health or longevity benefits observed in studies using NAD + modulation strategies. Although this is consistent and mechanistically validated across different preclinical models, as reviewed in the "Preclinical and clinical applications of NAD + -modulating interventions for mitochondrial homeostasis and health benefits" section, the correspondence between NAD + changes and mitochondrial or metabolic alterations is more complex in human studies. For instance, NAD + levels and mitochondrial function have been shown to decline in sarcopenia muscle in one cohort, while another study did not observe a difference in NAD + levels in sarcopenic muscle, and even NR supplementation had no effect on NAD + levels. Instead, in mitochondrial myopathy patients, utilizing compounds like NA increased both muscle and blood NAD + levels, muscle strength, and induced mitochondrial biogenesis and respiration. Studies with NR supplementation in PD or HF patients have provided indications of impacting mitochondrial function in peripheral tissues, although evidence for impacting mitochondria in the primary target tissues was not reported. Additionally, in the context of relatively healthy cohorts like aged or overweight individuals, or even in obese cohorts, NAD + modulation by NR did not correspond to significant changes in mitochondrial homeostasis. Only a trial by Lapatto et al.showed increased muscle mitochondrial biogenesis with NR supplementation, although this was not placebo-controlled. Finally, a large proportion of the other studies reviewed herein, including the ones focused on exercise, did not include or report on mitochondrial readouts following NAD + modulation. Therefore, this highlights the need for further establishing and validating the crosstalk between NAD + and the different features of mitochondrial function as a panel of possible molecular efficacy readouts in clinical settings.

### Endogenous nicotinamide riboside metabolism protects against diet-induced liver damage [^1159E23x]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Nicotinamide riboside (NR) is a natural precursor for nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD +) biosynthesis. NAD + levels play a crucial role in energy homeostasis and genome stability by acting as a substrate for different families of enzymes, such as sirtuins (SIRTs) and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs). NAD + bioavailability declines in situations of metabolic disease, including diet-induced obesity and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), as well as during aging, fostering age-related physiological decline –.

Restoring or enhancing NAD + levels through NR or nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) supplementation has been shown to prevent/treat a broad range of metabolic and age-related disorders. For example, dietary supplementation with NR prevented diet-induced obesity and glucose intolerance in mice. NR also had remarkable effects on hepatic metabolism, conferring resistance to hepatic lipid accumulation and reversing NAFLD states. At the molecular level, the benefits of NR/NMN supplementation have been associated with the prevention of mitochondrial dysfunction at least in part via the activation of sirtuin enzymes. Upon high-fat diet (HFD) feeding, however, the activity of another major NAD + -consuming enzyme, PARP1, is induced in order to repair DNA damage, thereby competing with sirtuins for intracellular NAD + resources. Thus, the maintenance of NAD + levels is essential to sustain PARP and sirtuin activities in situations of metabolic stress and delineates the basis for the therapeutic benefits of exogenous NR supplementation.

Cellular metabolism and oxidative stress

Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) is essential for energy generation and cell health. Sirtuins are NAD-dependent enzymes involved in cellular energy metabolism and maintaining undamaged deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). Preclinical data shows that the sirtuin SIRT1 is protective against kidney damage resulting from oxidative injury. The activity of SIRT1 can be augmented by NAD + precursors. A single-center phase 2 RCT in cardiac surgery patients is ongoing to evaluate the efficacy of NAD supplementation (NCT04342975).

### Chronic nicotinamide mononucleotide supplementation elevates blood nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide levels and alters muscle function in healthy older men [^115qoo58]. Npj Aging (2022). Medium credibility.

While this study offers novel insights into NMN as a nutritional supplement and potential therapeutic entity, it has some limitations. First, the 42 enrolled participants were randomized between the two treatment groups that were adjusted for age, body mass index (BMI), and SMI. However, data from 22 participants were excluded, owing to which the adjustment between the two groups was disrupted, which may have compromised some results in this study. Further investigation will be needed to apply our findings to all older men, although the statistical analyses were valid for the population analyzed in this trial. Second, as all analyses were exploratory, and the primary analysis for each endpoint was specified, multiple comparisons were performed only without P value correction. Although the statistical analyses performed were valid for the population analyzed in this trial, further investigation is needed to confirm our findings. Third, we included only healthy older men in this study. Older participants were included in the study because NAD+ levels decrease with age in rodents and humans, and NAD+ supplementation can be more effective in older people. Moreover, only male participants were selected, considering the possibility that data from older females may be affected by the rapid decrease in estrogen or progesterone levels associated with menopause. We speculate that NMN administration might be effective in different populations, such as middle-aged adults or older women, because the apparent difference in the response to NR, another NAD+ precursor, owing to age or sex, has not been reported in human clinical studies –. However, it remains to be determined whether NMN supplementation is effective in populations that are heterogeneous with respect to gender, age, or baseline physiological functions, which is critical in determining the therapeutic potential of oral NMN supplementation. Thus, further clinical studies should be conducted in specific populations in this regard.

### Study details | NCT06971224 | NADream: effects of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide supplementation on sleep quality in healthy individuals… [^111eWdvf]. ClinicalTrials (2025). Medium credibility.

Study Overview Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide is important for regulating cellular energy metabolism, mitochondrial function, and circadian rhythms, which are key processes involved in the sleep-wake cycle and sleep regulation. Nicotinamide riboside supplementation has been shown to elevate NAD+ levels in humans. Higher NAD+ levels may support better sleep by restoration of mitochondrial efficiency and reducing oxidative stress. As people age, there is evidence of a decline in NAD+ levels, which may lead to mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and disruptions in circadian rhythms. These changes can negatively affect sleep architecture and reduce sleep quality. Impaired NAD+ metabolism has been linked to problems with the molecular clock, which regulates circadian timing through effects on sirtuin activity and clock genes such as BMAL1.

NAD+ also supports brain metabolism by maintaining mitochondrial function, promoting neuroprotection, regulating redox balance, and reducing neuroinflammation. By restoring NAD+ levels, NR supplementation may help improve mitochondrial efficiency, decrease oxidative damage, and enhance sleep-related cellular maintenance. NR may also support synchronization of circadian rhythms, further promoting healthy sleep. Its effects also include modulating neuroinflammatory pathways and strengthening cellular resilience against oxidative stress, both of which are essential for maintaining cognitive functions and neural plasticity during sleep. The NADream study will test whether NR supplementation can improve both objective and subjective measures of sleep in healthy adults. Sleep will be assessed using polysomnography, the gold standard for objective sleep measurement, along with actigraphy, Somnofy sleep monitoring, and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index.

This study will be a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group design. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive ether NR or a placebo for 8 weeks. The findings from this study will help determine whether NR supplementation could be a viable therapeutic option to explore further in this area.

Summary

The understanding of the molecular and cellular basis of aging has grown exponentially over recent years, and it is now accepted within the scientific community that aging is a malleable process; just as it can be accelerated, it can also be slowed and even reversed. This has far-reaching implications for our attitude and approach toward aging, presenting the opportunity to enter a new era of cellular regenerative medicine to not only manage the external signs of aging but also to develop therapies that support the body to repair and restore itself back to a state of internal well-being. A wealth of evidence now demonstrates that a decline in cellular nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) is a feature of aging and may play a role in the process. NAD+ plays a pivotal role in cellular metabolism and is a co-substrate for enzymes that play key roles in pathways that modify aging. Thus, interventions that increase NAD+ may slow aspects of the aging trajectory, and there is great interest in methods for cellular NAD+ restoration. Given these recent advancements in understanding the cellular aging process, it is important that there is an integration between the basic scientists who are investigating the underlying mechanisms of cellular aging and the surgeons and aesthetic practitioners who are providing antiaging therapies. This will allow the effective translation of this vastly complex area of biology into clinical practice so that people can continue to not only stay looking younger for longer but also experience improved health and wellness.

Methods

Ethical approval, informed consent, and study location

The study was conducted in accordance with the guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Graduate School of Medicine and Faculty of Medicine, The University of Tokyo Research Ethics Committee (2018013P). The study was registered at UMIN-CTR (UMIN000036321) before the patients were recruited. The participants received oral and written information before they provided written consent. The study was conducted at the Clinical Research Support Center Phase 1 Unit at the University of Tokyo Hospital.

Study design, randomization, and intervention

The study was designed as a placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group trial. Participants were examined at baseline and the 6-week and 12-week visits. After completion of the baseline investigations, participants were randomized to a 12-week supplementation of NMN or a placebo, with daily administration by a third party, C&C QUALITATIVE RESEARCH INSTITUTE INC (Tokyo, Japan); there were no significant differences in age, BMI, or SMI between the two groups (Table 1). The allocation to the NMN or placebo group was also managed by C&C QUALITATIVE RESEARCH INSTITUTE INC until the end of the study. The participants received oral supplementation of 250 mg of NMN (Mitsubishi Corporation Life Sciences Limited, Tokyo, Japan) once daily or a placebo for 12 weeks. The participants and data collectors were blinded to the treatment. Once all participants completed the study, the randomization code was released.

The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the potential benefits of NMN in increasing blood NAD + concentration and its effects on the body composition of older participants after the 12-week treatment. The secondary objective of the study was to evaluate aging-related parameters, such as muscle strength and performance, bone density, vision, and hearing ability.

Preclinical and clinical applications of NAD + -modulating interventions for mitochondrial homeostasis and health benefits

NAD + levels and mitochondrial homeostasis have been linked to symptoms of aging as well as other pathologies, including cancer, progressive muscle diseases, and neurodegenerative diseases. This recognition encouraged preclinical studies aiming to investigate both mechanistic aspects and intervention strategies to characterize and target this biological axis in conditions affecting muscle, brain, the immune system, and metabolic diseases. Findings from these investigations, particularly those involving natural NAD + precursors, have reached the first clinical testing; this has contributed to acquiring a better physiological understanding of their metabolism in humans, while also highlighting the challenges and limitations of the current trials. This chapter will focus on NAD + -modulating interventions that have been more frequently indicated to exert health benefits through regulation of mitochondrial homeostasis; an overview of preclinical and clinical studies performed can be found in Table 1 and Table 2, respectively.

Table 1
Overview of preclinical studies investigating NAD + boosters in aging and age-related conditions

Table 2
Overview of clinical studies investigating NAD + boosters in aging and age-related conditions

Preclinical studies

Age-related declining NAD + levels in aging have been observed in rodents and different human tissues, such as muscle, liver, and brain. Similarly, NAD + levels appear reduced in preclinical models of age-associated diseases, including ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T), mitochondrial myopathies, and Alzheimer's disease (AD), and disease-matched clinical samples. Interestingly, interventions that boost NAD + levels resulted in extended lifespan in worms and mice, suggesting a therapeutic potential for raising NAD + in various pathological conditions or age-associated diseases. A recurring theme across these studies is that mitochondrial dysfunction parallels NAD + metabolism alterations, contributing to the detrimental phenotypes in different tissues or at the organism level.

### NADIntermediates: the biology and therapeutic potential of NMN and NR [^116ifd8L]. Cell Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

Research on the biology of NAD + has been gaining momentum, providing many critical insights into the pathogenesis of age-associated functional decline and diseases. In particular, two key NAD + intermediates, nicotinamide riboside (NR) and nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), have been extensively studied over the past several years. Supplementing these NAD + intermediates has shown preventive and therapeutic effects, ameliorating age-associated pathophysiologies and disease conditions. Although the pharmacokinetics and metabolic fates of NMN and NR are still under intensive investigation, these NAD + intermediates can exhibit distinct behavior, and their fates appear to depend on the tissue distribution and expression levels of NAD + biosynthetic enzymes, nucleotidases, and presumptive transporters for each. A comprehensive concept that connects NAD + metabolism to the control of aging and longevity in mammals has been proposed, and the stage is now set to test whether these exciting preclinical results can be translated to improve human health.

Reversal or mitigation against an age-related decline in NAD + has likely benefits, and this premise has driven academic and commercial endeavour to develop dietary supplements that achieve this outcome. We used a systems-based approach to improve on current supplements by targeting multiple points in the NAD + salvage pathway. In a double-blind, randomised, crossover trial, the supplement - Nuchido TIME+® (NT) - increased NAD + concentration in whole blood. This was associated with an increase in SIRT1 and an increase in nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) in peripheral blood mononucleocytes, lower concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines in plasma, including a reduction in interleukin 2 (IL2), a reduction in glycated serum protein and a shift in the glycosylation profile of immunoglobulin G (IgG) toward a younger biological age, all of which are likely to promote a healthier ageing trajectory.

### NRK1 controls nicotinamide mononucleotide and nicotinamide riboside metabolism in mammalian cells [^113pxoU1]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

NAD + is a vital redox cofactor and a substrate required for activity of various enzyme families, including sirtuins and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases. Supplementation with NAD + precursors, such as nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) or nicotinamide riboside (NR), protects against metabolic disease, neurodegenerative disorders and age-related physiological decline in mammals. Here we show that nicotinamide riboside kinase 1 (NRK1) is necessary and rate-limiting for the use of exogenous NR and NMN for NAD + synthesis. Using genetic gain- and loss-of-function models, we further demonstrate that the role of NRK1 in driving NAD + synthesis from other NAD + precursors, such as nicotinamide or nicotinic acid, is dispensable. Using stable isotope-labelled compounds, we confirm NMN is metabolized extracellularly to NR that is then taken up by the cell and converted into NAD +. Our results indicate that mammalian cells require conversion of extracellular NMN to NR for cellular uptake and NAD + synthesis, explaining the overlapping metabolic effects observed with the two compounds.

Effect of NR on other domains of physiological function

To gain exploratory insight into potential benefits of NR supplementation on other domains of physiological function in healthy middle-aged and older adults, we assessed a wide variety of outcomes indicative of metabolic function, motor function, and exercise capacity/performance. Total energy intake and expenditure, oxidative fuel source (carbohydrate vs. fat), and physical activity patterns were not affected by NR (Supplementary Table 7). Likewise, we observed no difference in body mass, body mass index (BMI) or percent body fat compared with the placebo arm (Supplementary Table 7) and no differences were observed in measures of glucose or insulin regulation (Supplementary Table 7). Finally, there was no effect of the intervention on overall motor function (Supplementary Figure 2), maximal exercise capacity, as assessed by VO₂ max and treadmill time to exhaustion (Supplementary Figure 1A, B), or on markers of submaximal exercise performance (Supplementary Figure 1C−F).

### Chronic nicotinamide riboside supplementation is well-tolerated and elevates NADin healthy middle-aged and older adults [^117VHzwL]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

In addition to cardiovascular parameters, we also assessed the effect of NR on other domains of physiological function. Our findings suggest that a relatively short (6-week) intervention with NR did not change total energy expenditure or energy expenditure from fat oxidation (based on assessment of RER) at rest. We also did not observe any improvement in blood glucose control or insulin sensitivity. In both cases, it is important to note that this study was conducted in lean, healthy middle-aged and older adults without baseline metabolic dysfunction. These observations are in agreement with previous findings that NR modulates resting metabolic rate only in mice exposed to a high-fat diet, and does not influence blood glucose regulation in animals fed normal chow diets. Based on these preclinical observations, it is possible that chronic NR supplementation might improve metabolic function in groups who consume unhealthy diets and/or have metabolic disorders such as obesity, diabetes, and/or the metabolic syndrome.

Our results also suggest that NR does not obviously improve aerobic exercise capacity or motor function in healthy middle-aged and older men and women with good baseline physical status. Although Frederick et al.recently identified a role for NAD + in rescuing neuromuscular function and exercise capacity in mice, these studies were conducted using a genetically induced model of impaired NAD + bioavailability that may represent more severe NAD + depletion than that which occurs with healthy aging. Future studies should explore the role of NR supplementation on aerobic exercise capacity and motor performance in groups with impaired mobility such as frail older adults and in individuals with chronic diseases associated with reduced cardiorespiratory fitness and exercise intolerance.

In summary, the results of the present study provide initial evidence that chronic NR supplementation is well-tolerated in healthy middle-aged and older adults, and extend recent findings that acute supplementation with NR is effective for stimulating NAD + metabolism in humans. Furthermore, we provide the first insight into the effects of NR supplementation on physiological function in humans, and identify SBP and aortic stiffness as promising cardiovascular outcomes to be assessed in larger-scale clinical trials. Future work should also compare the relative increases in NAD + and the physiological benefits of NR with conventional CR in order to further evaluate the use of this dietary supplement as a true "CR-mimetic" compound.

### Chronic nicotinamide riboside supplementation is well-tolerated and elevates NADin healthy middle-aged and older adults [^115HskPw]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The primary finding of this study is that chronic oral supplementation with 1000 mg per day of NR is a well-tolerated and effective strategy for stimulating NAD + metabolism in healthy middle-aged and older humans. Additionally, our exploratory analyses of the effects of NR supplementation on physiological function suggest that the ability of NR to reduce SBP and aortic stiffness, two clinically important risk indicators of cardiovascular function and health, are among the most promising hypotheses to test in a future larger-scale clinical trial, particularly in individuals with above-normal baseline SBP.

In this small initial intervention trial, NR was well tolerated and elicited no serious adverse effects. Additionally, we found that NR stimulated NAD + metabolism without any difference in treatment-emergent AEs compared with placebo, supporting previous suggestions that NR may be a more suitable NAD + precursor than niacin (i.e. nicotinic acid and nicotinamide), which` also is capable of entering the NAD + salvage pathway, but is associated with a painful flushing sensation at therapeutic doses. The flushing response induced by niacin is specifically caused by the binding of nicotinic acid to the Gpr109A receptor on epithelial cells, an action that is not expected to occur with NR, thereby minimizing the risk of this side effect at equivalent doses. Although three of the subjects in our study did report flushing, two of these subjects were taking the placebo capsules, suggesting that NR itself did not appear to be associated with flushing. Despite these promising findings, we wish to emphasize that the size of the cohort in the present study is insufficient to establish the broader safety profile of NR at this dose. Larger, more definitive clinical trials, similar to those conducted with niacin, will be necessary to confirm this preliminary evaluation of tolerability and to more definitively assess its overall safety. However, indirect evidence for the potential safety of NR supplementation is suggested by the widespread use of niacin over past 60 years for the treatment of high cholesterol, with limited side effects other than flushing.

### Chronic nicotinamide riboside supplementation is well-tolerated and elevates NADin healthy middle-aged and older adults [^115NWiC1]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Finally, we wish to emphasize certain limitations of this initial trial on chronic NR supplementation in humans. Because the physiological outcomes in this study were designed to be exploratory in nature, the associated statistical inferences for those variables were based on one-sided hypothesis testing and the alpha level was set at a conservative P < 0.006 to account for multiple testing. More targeted studies (e.g. phase-II clinical trials) with fewer outcomes based on two-sided statistical inference are needed to confirm the effects of NR supplementation on SBP and carotid-femoral PWV (aortic stiffness) before moving towards larger-scale (phase-III) clinical trials and any recommendation of NR supplementation for improving these cardiovascular health indicators. It is also important to note that although NR is presently available as a dietary supplement under the trade name NIAGEN ® (ChromaDex, Inc.), the dose tested in the present study exceeds the label-recommended dose and should be considered investigational until further work can be performed to confirm the safety and efficacy of higher doses for use by the general population. Lastly, the present study assessed the influence of chronic NR supplementation on healthy middle-aged and older adults, which may have reduced the likelihood of observing greater or, in the case of several outcomes assessed, any improvements in physiological function. Thus, future investigations should include studies on groups with cardio-metabolic diseases, motor deficits, impaired NAD + metabolism, and/or other disorders to determine the efficacy of NR supplementation for enhancing health status in populations with impaired baseline physiological function.

### NRK1 controls nicotinamide mononucleotide and nicotinamide riboside metabolism in mammalian cells [^1178sUNj]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

NRK isozymes are highly conserved through evolution, which indicates a primordial need for NR as an NAD + precursor. In addition, the induction of NRK2 in response to cellular damage or stresssuggests the existence of a demand for circulating NR. The natural source of oral NR, NAM and NA is largely the NAD + in the food we eat as broken down by digestion and the microbiome. Interestingly, it was recently shown that human cytosolic 5′-nucleotidases can catalyse the conversion of NMN into NR inside the cell and that at least some cells are able to release nucleoside precursors of NAD + synthesis for other cells, which also suggests that NR is in circulation. Finally, the presence of NR in bodily fluids is also supported by the fact that several bacteria affecting humans, such as Haemophilus influenza and Streptococcus pneumoniae rely on exogenous NR to support NAD + synthesis and life. Future work will be required to fully characterize circulating NAD +, NMN and NR, which may be cell-associated. Nonetheless, the different efficacy of NAM and NR to boost NAD + synthesis and protect against metabolic dysfunctions, indicate that NR and NAM are distinct vitamins with non-identical tissue and cellular activities. This concept was established by a recent study in which orally administered equimolar NAM, NR and NA produced unique effects on hepatic NAD + metabolism through distinct biosynthetic routes. This experiment, conducted in parallel with a human clinical trial at the same effective dose of NR, showed that NR produces the greatest rise in liver NAD + synthesis, followed by NAM and NA.

By establishing NRK1 as a rate-limiting and essential enzyme for NR and NMN metabolism, we highlight NR and NMN as convergent NR supplementation strategies. Further work will be needed to optimize compositions or formulations that may be preferentially targeted to particular organs to provide nutritional and therapeutic benefits.

### Chronic nicotinamide mononucleotide supplementation elevates blood nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide levels and alters muscle function in healthy older men [^1172xkJz]. Npj Aging (2022). Medium credibility.

The results of NR clinical trials have been reported. In these trials, NR (100–2000 mg/day) was administered to healthy participants or individuals with obesity for a maximum of 12 weeks –. Most NR clinical trials have reported the safety of NR administration – and the elevation of NAD + or NAD + -related metabolites in the blood –. The most recent report showed that NR increases the fat-free body mass in participants with obesity, although no effect was observed on insulin sensitivity, mitochondrial function, and hepatic and intramyocellular lipid accumulation.

Recently, for the first time, the safety of single-day NMN oral administration was reported in humans. Moreover, while the drafting of this paper was underway, a 10-week, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial to evaluate the effect of NMN supplementation on metabolic function in 25 postmenopausal women with prediabetes was reported, in which NMN supplementation increased muscle insulin sensitivity, insulin signaling, and remodeling in women with prediabetes who are overweight or obese. Furthermore, the effects of NMN supplementation combined with exercise training have been reported in healthy amateur runners aged 27–50 years. NMN dose-dependently increased the ventilatory threshold and improved aerobic capacity during exercise. However, evidence of the effects of human interventions with NMN remains limited for older adults.

Therefore, to elucidate the safety and efficacy of NMN administration in older adults, we conducted a placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study with the administration of 250 mg of NMN to healthy men aged 65 years or more for 12 weeks. We demonstrated that NMN oral supplementation at 250 mg/day in healthy older men for 12 weeks was safe and well-tolerated and significantly increased the levels of NAD + and NAD +-related metabolites in whole blood. Furthermore, NMN administration partly improved muscle performance, evaluated using gait speed and grip strength, in healthy older men. Thus, the chronic oral administration of NMN could be a therapeutic strategy for aging-related disorders in humans, such as sarcopenia.

### Epigenetic regulation of heart-ECHS [^116JHUrG]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2022). Medium credibility.

As nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD +)–dependent histone deacetylase, some sirtuin proteins are known to reduce H3K9Ac levels. It was also previously reported that Sirt3 increased cellular Echs1 levels by inhibiting its degradation. Therefore, Cai et altested whether adding nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), a precursor of NAD +, into the diet would alleviate the cardiomyopathy in Echs1 +/− mice. They found that the NMN diet increased cellular NAD +, Echs1, nuclear p300, and H3K9Ac levels in the Echs1 +/− mouse hearts. Importantly, the NMN diet resulted in mild but statistically significant improvement of cardiac function and largely prevented cardiac fibrosis in Echs1 +/− mice.

With new discoveries come new questions. Although ECHS1 interacts with p300 in both cardiomyocytes and cardiac fibroblasts, the inhibition of p300 nuclear translocation and ensuing H3K9Ac appear to occur only in fibroblasts. It remains little understood how this cell-type specificity is achieved. NMN diet is likely to affect many cellular NAD + -dependent pathways in multiple cardiac cell types. Which biological processes and cell types are most important for its benefit? Will NMN/NAD + dietary supplementation helps patients with ECHS1 mutations? The findings of Cai et alfurther expand the notion that mitochondrial proteins can regulate nuclear gene transcription through a variety of epigenetic mechanisms. In the case of ECHS1, it seems to engage distinct epigenetic mechanisms in a cell type–specific manner to modulate cardiac function and gene regulation (Figure 1). Future studies will undoubtedly discover additional mechanisms of mitochondria-to-nucleus retrograde signaling and elucidate their importance in both physiology and disease.

### The use of a systems approach to increase NADin human participants [^11263wKN]. Npj Aging (2024). Medium credibility.

CD38 has been described as the principal NAD + hydrolase in the cell. It has been shown to have multiple functions, among which is a role in cell signalling by generating, from NAD +, the second messenger molecule, cyclic ADP ribose (cADPR). cADPR plays a role in intracellular Ca²⁺ signalling through activation of ryanodine receptors to mobilise Ca²⁺ from the endoplasmic reticulum and also has a role in multiple aspects of the inflammatory response. The protection against features of ageing afforded by the pharmacological inhibition or knockout of CD38 in mice, such as protection against obesity, improved glucose tolerance, muscle function, exercise capacity and cardiac functionand increased lifespan, have been attributed to the NAD + -sparing effect of these interventions.

There is currently much interest academically and commercially in approaches to boost NAD + as a potential anti-ageing therapy. In vivo NAD + restoration has been investigated extensively and demonstrates whole body benefits, recently reviewed in detail. The instability and low bioavailability to most cell types of NAD + render direct oral supplementation inefficacious. Dietary supplements intended to increase NAD + in human subjects feed in at points in the process of biosynthesis, of which there are three pathways (see ref.for a full description). Of these, the salvage pathway is the dominant pathway. This pathway recycles NAM released by the cleavage of NAD + through the action of NAD + -consuming enzymes including the sirtuins, PARPs and CD38. Most dietary supplements are based on providing a supply of precursors to the salvage pathway, most commonly NR or NMN (nicotinamide mononucleotide). We summarise the outcomes of 10 we identified, which all provided NR, in a recent review article. Of these, seven measured NAD + in blood (whole blood or peripheral blood mononucleocytes (PBMCs)) and three measured NAD + in skeletal muscle. Significant but variable increases in NAD + are reported. Modest increases (40–59%) were achieved using the dose of 300 mg/d approved by the FDA and EFSA, with larger increases (more than a doubling of the sample mean or doubling of concentration in the highest responder) requiring doses far in excess (1000–2000 mg/d). Even at these very high doses, the three studies that measured NAD + in skeletal muscle detected no increase –. Nine published studies that provided NMN report similarly variable outcomes. Increases in NAD + in whole blood, plasma, serum or PBMCs were measured in six of these –, which include a study that achieved a 5.7-fold mean increase after 60 d at 600 mg/d, but three achieved no increase, despite use of similar doses –. Factors such as duration of the trial period, participant demographics, physical properties of NR or NMN administered (e.g. particle size and crystalline form), methods of sample collection and NAD + measurement likely account for some of this variability. However, we argue that a key factor that limits efficacy is likely to be changes to the NAD + -metabolising machinery in the cell that occur as the cell gets older, which themselves curtail the ability of the cell to generate NAD + from NR, NMN and other precursors or to consume NAD + at a higher rate. Notably, the enzyme nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT), which catalyses the rate-limiting step in the NAD + salvage pathway, has been shown to decline with age in mice and rats –, as well as humans. There is good evidence that CD38, the major cellular NAD + hydrolase and mediator of various aspects of the inflammatory response, becomes overexpressed during ageing, accompanying the high level of inflammation frequently reported in older tissues (referred to as 'inflammaging'). Increased expression of the methylating enzyme nicotinamide-N-methyltransferase (NNMT) also leads to the methylation and excretion of NAM as methyl nicotinamide (MeNAM) further limiting the recycling of NAM to NAD + by the salvage pathway. We argue that a significant limitation of simple, single precursor supplements is that, while providing a supply of substrate into the salvage pathway, this cannot be optimally converted to NAD + because of the aforementioned issues that prevent optimal NAD + conversion and usage. Figure 1a shows the age-related changes to the NAD + salvage pathway and enzymes that contribute to depletion of NAD +. Thus, we took a systems approach to administer participants with a supplement (NT) targeting multiple enzymes involved in NAD+ metabolism whilst also providing NAD + precursor (Fig. 1b). Table 1 lists the components of NT and specifies the basis (intended action) for including them in the supplement –.

### Sirtuins and NADin the development and treatment of metabolic and cardiovascular diseases [^1159z2NY]. Circulation Research (2018). Low credibility.

The sirtuin family of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-dependent deacylases (SIRT1-7) are thought to be responsible, in large part, for the cardiometabolic benefits of lean diets and exercise and when upregulated can delay key aspects of aging. SIRT1, for example, protects against a decline in vascular endothelial function, metabolic syndrome, ischemia-reperfusion injury, obesity, and cardiomyopathy, and SIRT3 is protective against dyslipidemia and ischemia-reperfusion injury. With increasing age, however, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide levels and sirtuin activity steadily decrease, and the decline is further exacerbated by obesity and sedentary lifestyles. Activation of sirtuins or nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide repletion induces angiogenesis, insulin sensitivity, and other health benefits in a wide range of age-related cardiovascular and metabolic disease models. Human clinical trials testing agents that activate SIRT1 or boost nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide levels are in progress and show promise in their ability to improve the health of cardiovascular and metabolic disease patients.

### Endogenous nicotinamide riboside metabolism protects against diet-induced liver damage [^116dnHbS]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Supplementation with the NAD + precursor nicotinamide riboside (NR) ameliorates and prevents a broad array of metabolic and aging disorders in mice. However, little is known about the physiological role of endogenous NR metabolism. We have previously shown that NR kinase 1 (NRK1) is rate-limiting and essential for NR-induced NAD + synthesis in hepatic cells. To understand the relevance of hepatic NR metabolism, we generated whole body and liver-specific NRK1 knockout mice. Here, we show that NRK1 deficiency leads to decreased gluconeogenic potential and impaired mitochondrial function. Upon high-fat feeding, NRK1 deficient mice develop glucose intolerance, insulin resistance and hepatosteatosis. Furthermore, they are more susceptible to diet-induced liver DNA damage, due to compromised PARP1 activity. Our results demonstrate that endogenous NR metabolism is critical to sustain hepatic NAD + levels and hinder diet-induced metabolic damage, highlighting the relevance of NRK1 as a therapeutic target for metabolic disorders.

### The role of NADmetabolism and its modulation of mitochondria in aging and disease [^1164XCsB]. Npj Metabolic Health and Disease. (2025). Medium credibility.

NMN is well tolerated in healthy participants who received 300, 600, or 900 mg per day for a total of 60 days, with all NMN doses increasing blood NAD + levels, and no adverse events were observed. Additionally, a 10-week study in overweight or obese post-menopausal women with prediabetes found that 250 mg NMN per day partially increased muscle insulin signaling and sensitivity, but no change in mitochondrial oxidative capacity was found. Another study with NMN indicated that NMN supplementation of 250 mg per day in aged men was well tolerated, leading to increased NAD + levels in whole blood and improved muscle performance; however, this study did not provide mitochondrial function measurements.

Alternative to supplementation of precursors, as described in the "NAD + and precursors supplementation" section, it is possible to administer NAD + itself through intravenous infusions. These initial studies reported increased NAD + and NAM levels in plasma, and in urine, the excreted NAD + levels increased after 6 h, but it must be noted that these trials utilized small cohorts and short testing periods, and only a minor trend for cognitive improvement was observed. Furthermore, evidence for changes in the level of blood or tissue mitochondrial function or metabolic readouts is currently lacking for these studies.

### The role of NADmetabolism and its modulation of mitochondria in aging and disease [^115rUz9s]. Npj Metabolic Health and Disease. (2025). Medium credibility.

Given the role of NAD + in modulating the processes described above, NAD + -boosting interventions are being investigated for supporting mitochondrial homeostasis. For instance, treatment with the NRK-salvage precursor NR in mice, C. elegans, and mammalian cells resulted in increased mitochondrial function and biogenesis, UPR mt, and antioxidant response gene expression –. In C. elegans, NR and NMN improved mitophagy through pink1 and Parkin homologs pdr-1. NMN supplementation in mice also improved mitochondrial morphology through DRP1, and reduced ROS through antioxidant response expression. Treatment with NR or the PARP inhibitor Olaparib also improved mitochondrial morphology in aged nematodes and mammalian muscle cells during proteotoxic stress. NAM treatment increased mitochondrial NAD + /NADH ratios and improved mitochondrial membrane potential in human primary cells.

As exemplified above, these and other studies have shown the mechanistic role of NAD + in mitochondrial function in cellular and animal models. The relevance of NAD + -boosting strategies for mitochondrial homeostasis and implications for health benefits in the context of aging and disease in preclinical and clinical studies will be discussed in the "Preclinical and clinical applications of NAD + -modulating interventions for mitochondrial homeostasis and health benefits" section.

### Is there a role for novel supplements in the management of fatigue in rheumatic diseases? [^116t4Tm7]. RMD Open (2024). Medium credibility.

Fatigue is a common symptom of rheumatic diseases and frequently persists even when patients are in a near-remission state. In seeking options to manage troublesome symptoms such as fatigue, complementary and alternative medicines (CAM) are often used by patients despite a lack of evidence base behind such treatment strategies. CAM use is further promoted by social media and 'influencer' marketing without rigorous process to ensure scientific accuracy. One mechanism of recent interest in the CAM market is enhancing cellular pathways of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), purported to restore mitochondrial function. However, clinical trials of NAD+ pathway supplements lack rigorous trial design, many declare conflicts of interest, and safety data is limited. Ultimately, CAM use by our patients is unavoidable. To adequately inform patients about CAM, we need to keep updated on both the latest scientific literature and social media trends. In so doing, we can then propose to patients how standard-of-care therapies, evidence-based lifestyle modifications and CAM might safely and effectively integrate to form a treatment plan.

### NRK1 controls nicotinamide mononucleotide and nicotinamide riboside metabolism in mammalian cells [^111qYZHb]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Supplementation with NR and NMN has recently been shown to promote largely overlapping benefits on metabolic health, mitochondrial and neurodegenerative disorders. Although both compounds lead to NAD + synthesis, specific analysis of their bioavailability and metabolism remained to be elucidated. Our work identifies NRK1 as the central rate-limiting enzyme for the utilization of both compounds and, consequently, for their metabolic benefits.

NRK1 and NRK2 were initially described as highly conserved mammalian homologs of yeast Nrk1 with the ability to convert NR to NMN in a newly identified pathway of eukaryotic NAD + biosynthesis. Despite similar enzymatic activities, these enzymes display distinct tissue expression patterns. The baseline expression of the Nmrk2 gene is highly restricted to muscle and this enzyme proved to be unstable when ectopically expressed in cultured fibroblasts. This led us to focus on the more ubiquitously expressed NRK1 isozyme. Here we show that although NRK1 is dispensable for maintenance of basal NAD + levels in cells cultured in standard NAM-containing media, it is rate-limiting for cells to utilize NR and NMN as sources of NAD +. In sharp contrast, NRK1 is dispensable for conversion of NAM and NA into NAD +. In addition, our data from quantitative mass spectrometry clearly show that in vitro NR supplementation does not lead to NAM accumulation in the media at any point before NAD + synthesis. In vivo, however, intraperitoneal NR and NMN administration quickly lead to increases in NAM. Our results further demonstrate that while NR is spontaneously converted to NAM in cell-free plasma, NMN is more resistant to this process in vitro. This indicates that the comparable increases in NAM levels observed after NMN administration likely derive from NMN to NR dephosphorylation. The chronic effects of NR or NMN on health, however, are unlikely to rely on their transformation to NAM, for example, many of the benefits of NR and NMN are attributed to sirtuin activation, as both compounds led to higher sirtuin activities from yeast to mammals. NAM, in contrast, is a well reported and widely used sirtuin inhibitorand has been recently shown to inhibit NAD + -consuming activities in vivo. Similarly, both NMN and NR protect against insulin resistance and axotomy-induced axonal degeneration, an effect that has not been observed with NAM.

### NR-SAFE: a randomized, double-blind safety trial of high dose nicotinamide riboside in Parkinson's disease [^11789Wsf]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Parkinson's disease (PD) affects 1–2% of the population over 65 years, and is one of the fastest growing neurological disorders worldwide. Current treatments for PD provide partial and temporary symptomatic relief for motor symptoms, but make no impact on the rate of neurodegeneration and disease progression.

Increasing cellular levels of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) has been proposed as a potential neuroprotective therapeutic strategy for neurodegeneration. NAD, which constantly shuttles between its oxidized (NAD +) and reduced (NADH) state, is a coenzyme required for metabolic reduction-oxidation (redox) reactions, including mitochondrial respiration, which are integral to cellular energy metabolism. In addition, NAD + is substrate for a number of vital non-redox reactions that continuously degrade the molecule, requiring constant replenishment.

NAD levels decline with age, possibly due to multiple and only partially understood processes, and this has been proposed to contribute to age-related diseases, including parkinsonisms –. Conversely, increasing the NAD replenishment rate via supplementation of precursors has shown beneficial effects on life- and healthspan in multiple animal models, and evidence of neuroprotection in models of parkinsonism and other neurodegenerative diseases –. NAD-replenishment may target multiple processes associated with PD and other neurodegenerative disorders, including mitochondrial function and energy metabolism, DNA-repair –, epigenetic regulation, neuroinflammation, mitophagy, and lysosomal and proteasomal pathways. In this manner, NAD-replenishment may increase neuronal resilience, shielding neurons against multiple forms of disease-associated stress.

In the NADPARK study, a recent randomized double-blind clinical trial of NAD replenishment therapy with nicotinamide riboside (NR) in PD, we showed that oral intake of 1000 mg NR daily for 30 days significantly augments cerebral NAD levels. This was, in turn, associated with altered cerebral metabolism and a mild trend for clinical improvement. Furthermore, NR was associated with transcriptional upregulation of processes related to mitochondrial, lysosomal, and proteasomal function in blood cells and/or skeletal muscle.

### Chronic nicotinamide mononucleotide supplementation elevates blood nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide levels and alters muscle function in healthy older men [^111kFFJH]. Npj Aging (2022). Medium credibility.

In this study, we also performed a preliminary evaluation of the auditory capacity of participants using an audiometer before and after the intervention with NMN. In mice, SIRT3, an NAD+-dependent protein deacetylase localized to the mitochondria, is reportedly involved in the regulation of hearing ability during aging. NR supplementation in rodents has also been reported to improve noise-induced and age-related hearing loss via SIRT3 activation –. In our study, NMN supplementation partly tended to improve the auditory capacity of older people. However, there is limited information about the underlying mechanisms by which NAD + precursors may improve hearing in humans. Based on findings from preclinical studies –, NMN could similarly affect hearing in humans through mechanisms involving SIRT3 activation and the increased reduced-to-oxidized glutathione ratio in the mitochondria. However, in future, mechanistic studies are needed to test this hypothesis. Such studies will be technically challenging in humans, and it will be important to dissociate the effects of SIRT3 activation from the possible pleiotropic effects of the elevation of NAD+ metabolites.

### SLC29A1 and SLC29A2 are human nicotinamide cell membrane transporters [^115U8si7]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Nicotinamide (NAM), an active form of vitamin B3, is widely studied and utilized for its antiaging, metabolic regulation, organ protective and reparative effects. NAM participates in a variety of intracellular and intercellular processes and regulates cellular metabolism, stress and immune responses, all of which are molecular mechanisms of its physiological and biochemical functions. NAM is an important precursor of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), also called coenzyme I, and NAD+ plays a key role in cellular metabolic processes, including glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation, and ATP generation. In addition to acting as an electron receptor, NAD+ is an essential substrate of multiple signaling enzymes, including sirtuins (SIRTs), poly ADP-ribose polymerases, and cyclic ADP-ribose synthases, which are involved in metabolic configuration, stress resistance, mitochondrial biogenesis, DNA repair, transcription regulation and other activities. The functions of these enzymes depend on the cellular NAD+ pool. The salvage synthesis pathway, which involves a multistep enzymatic reaction originating from NAM in the cytoplasm, is the main source of cellular NAD+ in mammalian cells, implying that NAM supplementation directly affects the level and function of NAD+, and even cellular behavior and fate. Therefore, it is critical to elucidate how NAM enters cells.

### New horizons in life extension, healthspan extension and exceptional longevity [^1154xGj4]. Age and Ageing (2022). Medium credibility.

NAD precursors

NAD is a ubiquitous metabolite involved in many fundamental cellular pathways including those maintaining redox status, DNA repair and bioenergetics. Ageing is associated with reduced levels of NAD in many tissues, and depletion of NAD influence many ageing hallmarks.

Because NAD is a naturally occurring metabolite, there has been considerable interest in establishing the effects of NAD supplementation on ageing. Most studies have used NAD precursors (nicotinamide mononucleotide, NMN; nicotinamide riboside NR and nicotinamide NAM) because of their greater intracellular bioavailability. In vitro and animal experiments have shown that NAD supplementation can prevent or reverse a wide range of age-related pathologies and Hallmarks.

Lifespan studies have been undertaken in mice. One study reported an increase in lifespan of 5% when old mice were administered NR in food for 6 weeks, whereas another reported that 62 weeks of supplementation with NAM commenced in midlife did not increase lifespan. Recently the Interventions Testing Program confirmed that NR commenced in midlife or old age had no effect on lifespan.

There are > 30 human clinical trials of NR and NMN registered in. To date, published studies of NR have mostly evaluated its bioavailability, whereas there have been some recent studies of NMN that have evaluated clinical outcomes in older adults. A 12-week period of treatment with NMN reduced drowsiness and improved leg function in older people. A randomised clinical trial in 25 obese postmenopausal women found that 10 weeks of NMN compared to placebo was associated with improved insulin sensitivity in muscle but not liver or adipose tissue. It should be noted that these are all very small studies where multiple outcomes were evaluated.

### The role of NAD + in regenerative medicine [^1135muiJ]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

This overactivation of NAD+-consuming pathways with age and disease can severely compromise NAD+ availability in cells, subsequently limiting utilization of NAD+ by other critical NAD+-dependent enzymes that promote good health, such as the SIRTs. Despite this increased demand for NAD+ throughout life, NAD+ levels should, in theory, be self-sustaining as cells have the ability to rapidly recycle the breakdown products of NAD+ consumption to replenish NAD+. This occurs via the salvage pathway, which plays a major role in restoring NAD+. Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) is the rate-limiting enzyme in this recycling process, and it is now known that NAMPT levels decline with age in parallel with the decline of NAD+ in aged tissues.– This reduction in NAD+ biosynthesis via the salvage pathway is a significant factor in older cells because, as NAD+ consumption increases concurrently with age and demands for NAD+ replenishment and recycling increase, the resulting degraded NAD+ is no longer efficiently recycled, exacerbating a situation of declining NAD+ levels.

### Mechanisms and disease implications of sirtuin-mediated autophagic regulation [^117CstqB]. Experimental & Molecular Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Fig. 2
A potential model for the connection between NAD +, sirtuins and autophagy.

Nutrient limitation increases the level of the essential cellular metabolite NAD +, which activates sirtuins by inducing autophagy within cells and tissues. In contrast, the activity of sirtuins and autophagy decreases during normal aging, as well as due to some diseases, and correlates with the known reduction in levels of tissue NAD +

The link between sirtuins and autophagy may explain one other important aspect of regulation that was intimated in this review. It is generally believed that autophagic flux slows down as organisms age. Recent evidence has suggested that this is also true for more specialized forms of autophagy, such as mitophagy. The molecular basis for this phenomenon is not understood. Again, it is tempting to hypothesize that the well-known age-dependent decline in NAD + levels might provide a basis for this effect. Under this scenario, a primary fall in tissue levels of NAD + would limit sirtuin activity and thereby limit autophagic flux (Fig. 2). Given the growing interest in NAD biology, it will be important in the future to determine whether NAD supplementation exerts its beneficial effects through sirtuin-dependent autophagy induction. In addition, since direct sirtuin-activating compounds (STACs), including resveratrol and SRT2104, and indirect activators, such as nicotinamide riboside, are currently in clinical trials for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes, and neuropathy, it is critical to more fully understand how these agents work. Again, it is tempting to hypothesize that their clinical benefits might result from the link between sirtuin activity and autophagic flux. Finally, the small molecule activation of sirtuins and hence the indirect activation of autophagy might be advantageous over the direct and constitutive activation of autophagy. This supposition is based on the growing literature that autophagy might provide a survival advantage for tumor cells. In such a scenario, there may be safety concerns for the long-term administration of direct autophagy inducers. In contrast, therapeutic strategies that exploit the interaction between sirtuins and the autophagy machinery might provide for a more regulated and physiological approach. Undoubtedly, a fuller understanding of the cross-regulation between sirtuins and autophagy will likely provide important insights and potentially novel therapeutic avenues to combat a host of age-related diseases, as well as potentially a strategy to slow aging itself.

In addition to boosting NAD + -specific metabolites in PBMCs, we also observed increases in the mean concentration of other metabolites involved in the regulation of energy production and metabolism, including adenosine and adenosine triphosphate (ATP; mean change = 699 pmol per mg protein; one-sided 95% CI (84, ∞); Fig. 2 and Table 3); however, analysis of this metabolite was considered a secondary outcome and the increase did not attain statistical significance after correction for multiple comparisons. NR supplementation also tended to raise levels of adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and adenosine monophosphate (AMP), though increases in these metabolites did not reach statistical significance (Supplementary Table 4). Collectively, these findings indicate that chronic NR supplementation effectively stimulates NAD + metabolism in healthy middle-aged and older men and women.

### Nicotinamide riboside supplementation alters body composition and skeletal muscle acetylcarnitine concentrations in healthy obese humans [^111CdTkC]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Nicotinamide riboside (NR) is an NAD+ precursor that boosts cellular NAD+ concentrations. Preclinical studies have shown profound metabolic health effects after NR supplementation.

Objectives

We aimed to investigate the effects of 6 wk NR supplementation on insulin sensitivity, mitochondrial function, and other metabolic health parameters in overweight and obese volunteers.

Methods

A randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, crossover intervention study was conducted in 13 healthy overweight or obese men and women. Participants received 6 wk NR (1000 mg/d) and placebo supplementation, followed by broad metabolic phenotyping, including hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps, magnetic resonance spectroscopy, muscle biopsies, and assessment of ex vivo mitochondrial function and in vivo energy metabolism.

Results

Markers of increased NAD+ synthesis-nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide and methyl nicotinamide-were elevated in skeletal muscle after NR compared with placebo. NR increased body fat-free mass (62.65% ± 2.49% compared with 61.32% ± 2.58% in NR and placebo, respectively; change: 1.34% ± 0.50%, P = 0.02) and increased sleeping metabolic rate. Interestingly, acetylcarnitine concentrations in skeletal muscle were increased upon NR (4558 ± 749 compared with 3025 ± 316 pmol/mg dry weight in NR and placebo, respectively; change: 1533 ± 683 pmol/mg dry weight, P = 0.04) and the capacity to form acetylcarnitine upon exercise was higher in NR than in placebo (2.99 ± 0.30 compared with 2.40 ± 0.33 mmol/kg wet weight; change: 0.53 ± 0.21 mmol/kg wet weight, P = 0.01). However, no effects of NR were found on insulin sensitivity, mitochondrial function, hepatic and intramyocellular lipid accumulation, cardiac energy status, cardiac ejection fraction, ambulatory blood pressure, plasma markers of inflammation, or energy metabolism.

Conclusions

NR supplementation of 1000 mg/d for 6 wk in healthy overweight or obese men and women increased skeletal muscle NAD+ metabolites, affected skeletal muscle acetylcarnitine metabolism, and induced minor changes in body composition and sleeping metabolic rate. However, no other metabolic health effects were observed. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02835664.

### De novo NADsynthesis enhances mitochondrial function and improves health [^115BY3Br]. Nature (2018). Excellent credibility.

Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD +) is a co-substrate for several enzymes, including the sirtuin family of NAD + -dependent protein deacylases. Beneficial effects of increased NAD + levels and sirtuin activation on mitochondrial homeostasis, organismal metabolism and lifespan have been established across species. Here we show that α-amino-β-carboxymuconate-ε-semialdehyde decarboxylase (ACMSD), the enzyme that limits spontaneous cyclization of α-amino-β-carboxymuconate-ε-semialdehyde in the de novo NAD + synthesis pathway, controls cellular NAD + levels via an evolutionarily conserved mechanism in Caenorhabditis elegans and mouse. Genetic and pharmacological inhibition of ACMSD boosts de novo NAD + synthesis and sirtuin 1 activity, ultimately enhancing mitochondrial function. We also characterize two potent and selective inhibitors of ACMSD. Because expression of ACMSD is largely restricted to kidney and liver, these inhibitors may have therapeutic potential for protection of these tissues from injury. In summary, we identify ACMSD as a key modulator of cellular NAD + levels, sirtuin activity and mitochondrial homeostasis in kidney and liver.

Clinical studies

As summarized above, a multitude of preclinical studies have investigated the therapeutic effects of stimulating NAD + metabolism to ameliorate symptoms of aging and various pathologies, yielding promising results. These findings have stimulated clinical development attempts, particularly for NAD + modulators deemed suitable for human trials in terms of safety and upscaling, such as natural precursors. However, the extent of clinical testing differs between precursors. For instance, a review we conducted at this time of ClinicalTrials.gov.org using NAD + as " other term " input and the following precursors as intervention reveals that there are 4 clinical trials investigating NA, 7 trials focused on NAM, 8 trials administering NAD +, 16 trials studying NMN, and over 60 trials exploring NR with NAD + measurements included as readout. When reviewing the database with NAD + precursors as interventions yet with the " other term " input using " aging ", it indicates that there are currently no ongoing or published clinical trials for NA, 2 trials exploring NAM, 4 trials examining NAD +, 5 trials investigating NMN, and 18 trials focused on NR in elderly cohorts.

One key factor in evaluating clinical translation is determining the optimal dose and safety of that specific therapy. Given the current clinical landscape, the precursor NR is still the most utilized NAD + precursor and regulator overall. For instance, it has been demonstrated that NR supplementation is safe up to 3000 mg daily, with readouts reported for NAD + levels, mitochondrial function, and clinical phenotypes measured in several trials.

One clinical study investigated the effects of NR supplementation on skeletal muscle in 12 healthy elderlies. They demonstrated that a three-week supplementation of 1000 mg NR per day increased muscle NAD + metabolome, specifically NAAD and products of NAM clearance pathways, yet NAD + levels were not altered. Additionally, mitochondrial energy metabolism and inflammatory cytokines pathways were unaffected or downregulated, and no changes in functional readouts like hand grip strength were observed.

### Chronic nicotinamide mononucleotide supplementation elevates blood nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide levels and alters muscle function in healthy older men [^113iBtjg]. Npj Aging (2022). Medium credibility.

Chronic oral administration of NMN increases the levels of NAD+ and NAD+-related metabolites in whole blood

Whole blood samples were collected at baseline and at the 12-week visit from participants for the subsequent analysis of NAD+ and NAD+-related metabolites using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Oral NMN supplementation effectively elevated the levels of NMN and NAD+ as compared to placebo supplementation (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table S4). We also observed an increase in NR, which could indicate the possible conversion of NMN to NR by CD73. Notably, NMN also significantly elevated the levels of nicotinic acid mononucleotide (NAMN) (an intermediate of the NAD+ de novo synthesis pathway) and nicotinic acid riboside (NAR). Collectively, these findings indicate that the chronic oral supplementation of NMN effectively stimulates NAD+ metabolism in healthy older men.

### Nicotinamide riboside supplementation for treating arterial… [^114Hq3SN]. ClinicalTrials (2019). Medium credibility.

Research has shown that boosting NAD+ bioavailability to stimulate SIRT-1, a "CR mimetic" approach, reduces CFPW and oxidative stress in old mice, and this lab recently took the first step in translating these findings in a study of adults with normal kidney function and elevated systolic blood pressure. The data found that supplementation with nicotinamide riboside, a natural, commercially available precursor of NAD+ and novel CR mimetic, increased NAD+ bioavailability and reduced CFPWV and SBP. A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, single-site phase IIa clinical trial to assess the safety and efficacy of oral nicotinamide riboside for 3 months vs. placebo for decreasing aortic stiffness and SBP in patients with stage III and IV CKD is being proposed.

It is hypothesized that treatment will reduce CFPWV and SBP, as related to increases in systemic NAD+ bioavailability and reductions in oxidative stress, and inflammation. Nicotinamide riboside is a naturally occurring precursor of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, a critical mediator of the beneficial effects of CR, and therefore, a novel CR mimetic compound. We recently completed a study of nicotinamide riboside supplementation in healthy middle-age and older adults and demonstrated that 6 weeks of supplementation with nicotinamide riboside lowered carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity, the gold-standard clinical measure of aortic stiffness and a strong independent predictor of CVD and related morbidity and mortality in patients with and without kidney disease. In addition, treatment with nicotinamide riboside decreased systolic blood pressure by 8 mmHg compared with placebo.

As a next translational step, we propose to conduct a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, single site phase IIa clinical trial to further assess the safety and efficacy of oral nicotinamide riboside for decreasing aortic stiffness and SBP in patients with stage III and IV CKD. We hypothesize that nicotinamide riboside will lower aortic stiffness and SBP and that these improvements will be related to increases in systemic NAD+ bioavailability, selective influences on vascular smooth muscle tone, and reductions in markers of systemic oxidative stress and/or inflammation.

### Chronic nicotinamide riboside supplementation is well-tolerated and elevates NADin healthy middle-aged and older adults [^111wmB7v]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Efficacy of NR for increasing NAD + and related metabolites

After demonstrating the tolerability of chronic NR supplementation, our primary objective was to determine if NR raises blood cellular NAD + metabolism in humans. Because blood NAD + and several related metabolites of interest have recently been shown to be measurable in circulating peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), but undetectable in plasma and urine, we assessed the NAD + metabolome in circulating PBMCs, as previously established.

Oral NR supplementation effectively elevated levels of NAD + in PBMCs by ~60% compared with placebo (mean change = 6.2 pmol per mg protein; one-sided 95% CI (0.074, ∞)). The mean level of NADP + also increased, but did not reach statistical significance (mean change = 1.2 pmol per mg protein; one-sided 95% CI (−2.15, ∞)) (Fig. 2 and Table 3). Of note, NR also elevated levels of nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide (NAAD) nearly fivefold above the placebo condition (mean change = 1.1 pmol per mg protein; 95% CI (0.26, ∞)), confirming a previous report that NAAD is a highly sensitive and reliable biomarker of increased NAD + metabolism and a product of NR utilization in humans. NR also elevated the mean concentration of nicotinamide (NaM), but this was not statistically significant (mean change = 106.5 pmol per mg protein; one-sided 95% CI (−10.03, ∞)). An increase in NaM would suggest an increase in the activity of NAD + -consuming enzymes, which catalyze the breakdown of NAD + into NaM and ADP-Ribose. Though not significant, we also observed an ~1.5-fold increase in NMN (mean change = 0.72 pmol per mg protein; one-sided 95% CI (−0.60, ∞)), which may indicate the possible conversion of NR to NMN by nicotinamide riboside kinase (NRK) enzymes or further metabolism of NaM into NMN by nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT). Consistent with the only other report of NR ingestion in humans, we were unable to detect NR concentrations in PBMCs during either treatment condition, despite using optimized recovery methods. The magnitude by which NAD + increased in response to NR supplementation was negatively associated with blood cellular NAD + concentration during the placebo condition (R = −0.49, R² = 0.25), suggesting a greater response in individuals with naturally low blood cellular NAD + levels.

### The NAD⁺ precursor nicotinamide riboside enhances oxidative metabolism and protects against high-fat diet-induced obesity [^115KLZKq]. Cell Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

As NAD⁺ is a rate-limiting cosubstrate for the sirtuin enzymes, its modulation is emerging as a valuable tool to regulate sirtuin function and, consequently, oxidative metabolism. In line with this premise, decreased activity of PARP-1 or CD38-both NAD(+) consumers-increases NAD(+) bioavailability, resulting in SIRT1 activation and protection against metabolic disease. Here we evaluated whether similar effects could be achieved by increasing the supply of nicotinamide riboside (NR), a recently described natural NAD(+) precursor with the ability to increase NAD(+) levels, Sir2-dependent gene silencing, and replicative life span in yeast. We show that NR supplementation in mammalian cells and mouse tissues increases NAD(+) levels and activates SIRT1 and SIRT3, culminating in enhanced oxidative metabolism and protection against high-fat diet-induced metabolic abnormalities. Consequently, our results indicate that the natural vitamin NR could be used as a nutritional supplement to ameliorate metabolic and age-related disorders characterized by defective mitochondrial function.

### The use of a systems approach to increase NADin human participants [^1146noT5]. Npj Aging (2024). Medium credibility.

In addition to the primary reason for which components of the supplement were selected - reported action at specific points in the cellular processes that affect NAD + levels - some also have antioxidant and other actions that could potentially augment any efficacy of the supplement to slow the ageing process. Specifically, the catechins, included primarily as inhibitors of NNMT, are powerful antioxidants, as is the polyphenol troxerutin, which was incorporated with the aim that its reported action to increase NAMPT expression would stimulate the salvage pathway of NAD + biosynthesis. Moreover, an added potential, incidental benefit of deriving apigenin, EGCG and quercetin - intended to influence cellular NAD + content - from the natural extracts of parsley leaf, green tea leaf and rutin respectively (included in the supplement as a mixed 'botanical blend' of extracts), is that these are also rich in additional natural antioxidants and polyphenols. Further potential benefits of these components include stimulation of the removal of senescent cells (senolysis) by quercetin, and suppression by rutin of inflammation associated with cellular senescence (senomorphic activity).

### NAD precursors cycle between host tissues and the gut microbiome [^111uRVU9]. Cell Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) is an essential redox cofactor in mammals and microbes. Here we use isotope tracing to investigate the precursors supporting NAD synthesis in the gut microbiome of mice. We find that dietary NAD precursors are absorbed in the proximal part of the gastrointestinal tract and not available to microbes in the distal gut. Instead, circulating host nicotinamide enters the gut lumen and supports microbial NAD synthesis. The microbiome converts host-derived nicotinamide into nicotinic acid, which is used for NAD synthesis in host tissues and maintains circulating nicotinic acid levels even in the absence of dietary consumption. Moreover, the main route from oral nicotinamide riboside, a widely used nutraceutical, to host NAD is via conversion into nicotinic acid by the gut microbiome. Thus, we establish the capacity for circulating host micronutrients to feed the gut microbiome, and in turn be transformed in a manner that enhances host metabolic flexibility.

Figure 1
A simplified diagram of the cellular functions of NAD+. NAD+ is synthesised from tryptophan (via the kynurenine pathway), NA (via the Preiss-Handler pathway) and NAM (via the intermediate, NMN, through salvage/recycling pathways). The reduction reaction of NAD+ to NADH is involved in the oxidative steps of glycolysis and the citric acid cycle, as well as the reduction of reactive oxygen species produced from other cellular oxidation reactions. Additionally, NAD+ facilitates PARP, an enzyme involved with DNA repair in the nucleus and protein synthesis in the nucleus and cytoplasm. ATP, adenosine triphosphate; NA, nicotinic acid; NAD, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; NADH, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide+hydrogen; NAM, nicotinamide; NMN, nicotinamide mononucleotide; PARP, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase.

The desired effect of increasing cellular NAD+ to restore mitochondrial function has been proposed through three main mechanisms:

Directly supplementing NAD+
Supplementing NAD+ precursors (nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), nicotinamide riboside (NR), L-tryptophan, nicotinic acid or niacin (NA))
Inhibiting NAD+ degradation by CD38 and poly-ADP-ribose polymerases (PARP)

Public interest in NAD+ supplements continues to grow, with consumer market research anticipating accelerating interest this decade. Trends of increasing supplement use appear to be fuelled by early and generally scant research findings, ageing populations focusing on the pursuit of supplements with anti-ageing properties and the profound influence that social media holds on today's society. As dietary supplements rather than pharmaceuticals, NAD+ pathway effectors have also become readily available without rigorous experimental evidence supporting their use.

### Protective effects of sirtuins in cardiovascular diseases: from bench to bedside [^114G483r]. European Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

While Sirt1-specific activators may ultimately prove operative, there is increasing evidence that pan-sirtuin activators might be more effective. – The metabolite NAD + is an essential co-substrate for the activity of all sirtuins. Its levels decline in response to high-fat diet, DNA damage, and aging. Reports on sirtuin-dependent beneficial effects of increasing NAD + levels on metabolic homeostasis suggest that this strategy provides a novel and promising concept for cardiovascular protection.

NAD + levels are maintained by balancing its biosynthesis/salvage and breakdown (Figure 1). NAD + content can be boosted by exercise, inhibition of NAD + -consuming enzymes [sirtuins, poly-ADP-ribose-polymerases (PARPs), and cyclic ADP-ribose synthases], and administration of NAD + precursors, such as nicotinic acid, nicotinamide, nicotinamide mononucleotide, and nicotinamide riboside. NAD + precursor compounds as well as PARP and CD38 inhibitors have been used in several long-term mouse studies confirming wide-ranging health benefits on the metabolic, immune, and nervous systems. Raising NAD + levels may improve cardiac function in the context of ischaemia-reperfusion, but may be damaging in the setting of acute myocardial infarction. Thus, the net effects of increasing NAD + levels are likely to be dose- and time-dependent; such a biphasic response is well known from nitric oxide. The effects of raising NAD + levels long term in the context of chronic cardiovascular disease are likely to be beneficial. Yet, this has to be formally tested.

### Obesity accelerates cardiovascular ageing [^114LyxHd]. European Heart Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

NAD + precursors

Besides its crucial role in energy metabolism, the redox cofactor NAD + serves as a rate-limiting substrate for poly ADP-ribose polymerases (PARPs), sirtuin deacetylases, and cyclic ADP-ribose synthases, like CD38, thereby regulating DNA repair, post-translational modifications, and Ca²⁺ signalling. Notably, intracellular NAD + levels decrease with ageing and obesity. Mechanistically, a combination of increased DNA damage and increased expression of CD38 due to chronic inflammation reduces NAD + availability and limits sirtuin activity, leading to impaired mitochondrial function and accentuated ageing.

In animals, NAD + replenishment mimics the metabolic and anti-ageing benefits of CR. Indeed, administration of NAD + precursors, such as nicotinamide and nicotinamide riboside (NR) or the NAD + intermediate nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), protects mice from glucose intolerance and insulin resistance associated with ageing or obesity, with additive benefits when mice are aged and obese. Importantly, NAD + precursors also attenuate cardinal signs of ageing in the heart. Specifically, nicotinamide improves diastolic dysfunction and cardiac hypertrophy in aged mice and protects obese hypertensive rats with cardiometabolic syndrome from HFpEF. Protective effects against signs of vascular ageing, such as endothelial dysfunction, arterial stiffness, and cerebrovascular uncoupling, have also been observed in aged mice treated with NMN. Notably, despite these clear benefits of NAD + precursors on cardiovascular and general healthspan, the evidence supporting a positive effect on lifespan extension in mammals remains controversial.

In humans, aged patients with overweight and HFpEF exhibit reduced levels of cardiac NAD +. In pairs of monozygotic twins with disparate BMIs, twins with overweight presented a lower NAD + pool, higher activity of PARPs, and reduced regulation of mitochondrial proteostasis, demonstrating that obesity reduces NAD + levels and its downstream activity in humans. Moreover, exploratory human trials have shown a potential beneficial effect of NR on blood pressure in middle-aged and elderly otherwise healthy women and men.NMN exerted a similar vasoprotective effect as NR, but only in individuals with high BMI.NMN also improved insulin signalling in women with overweight or obesity and pre-diabetes. In patients with heart failure, early-phase trials suggest that NR reduces inflammation and increases mitochondrial respiration in peripheral blood mononuclear cells.

### A narrative review of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) + intermediates nicotinamide riboside and nicotinamide mononucleotide for keratinocyte carcinoma risk reduction [^111epdgV]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Oral nicotinamide (NAM) supplementation has been shown to decrease the incidence of keratinocyte carcinoma (KC) in high-risk skin cancer patients. NAM is a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) intermediate and thus directly leads to increased NAD+. This increase in NAD+ is believed to be responsible for NAM&rsquo; s impact on keratinocyte carcinoma risk. NAD+ has protective cellular effects and is a necessary cofactor for DNA repair, helping to prevent potentially oncogenic mutations. Nicotinamide riboside (NR) and nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) are NAD+ intermediates like NAM; however, their protective roles on cellular DNA and effects on cancer have been under-explored. Research into cellular metabolism and aging suggests that NR and NMN can lead to greater increases in NAD+ vs NAM. NR and NMN are safe and well-tolerated and are consequently currently undergoing investigation as agents able to protect against age-associated disease caused by NAD+ depletion. We hypothesize that oral supplementation with NR or NMN may lead to greater reductions in KC than NAM. J Drugs Dermatol. 2022;21(10): 1129–1132. doi:10.36849/JDD.6870.

### Protective effects of sirtuins in cardiovascular diseases: from bench to bedside [^117NxGSx]. European Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Sirtuins: mediators of caloric restriction

Silent Information Regulator 2 (SIR2) proteins — Sirtuins — are a family of histone deacetylases (HDACs) that catalyse deacetylation of both histone and non-histone lysine residues. Beyond deacetylase and deacylase activity, some sirtuins exert adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-ribosylase, demalonylase, desuccinylase, or glutarylase properties. Post-transcriptional modification of a wide range of protein targets of the seven mammalian orthologs (Sirt1–7) has been described in diverse settings. Their requirement for nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD +) distinguishes sirtuins from other HDAC classes and defines them as class III HDACs. This need of NAD + for their enzymatic activity closely links sirtuins to the cellular energy status, increasing their activity at times of low energy availability such as caloric restriction and exercise (Figure 1). –

Figure 1
Specific and unspecific sirtuin activation. Caloric restriction, exercise, and increased activity of 5′-adenosine monophosphate activated protein kinase drive mitochondrial metabolism and expression of nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase. Consecutive synthesis of nicotinamide adenine diphosphate activates sirtuins. Another route of sirtuin activation is increased nicotinamide adenine diphosphate biosynthesis via supplementation of nicotinamide adenine diphosphate precursors such as nicotinic acid, nicotinamide, nicotinamide mononucleotide, and nicotinamide riboside or through inhibition of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-consuming activities, such as poly-adenosine diphosphate-ribose-polymerases or CD38. Sirt1-activating compounds may mimic the effects of Sirt1. Stimulation of Sirt1 activity by these distinct pathways improves the capacity of the cells/organism for metabolic adaptation and/or cardiovascular protection.

To date, caloric restriction is the most robust intervention that has been reproducibly shown to prolong life span and maintain health in both invertebrates and vertebrates, including mammals. The first association between sirtuins and longevity in budding yeast 16 years agosparked efforts in numerous laboratories to unravel the mechanisms underlying sirtuin-mediated prolongation of life span and elucidate their potential to postpone the onset of age-related diseases. In this context, the seven mammalian sirtuin orthologs have been studied in diverse disease models, including insulin resistance and diabetes, inflammation, neurodegenerative disease, cancer, and more recently, in cardiovascular pathologies such as cardiac hypertrophy, heart failure, endothelial dysfunction, and atherosclerosis.

### Nicotinic acid riboside maintains NADhomeostasis and ameliorates aging-associated NADdecline [^115rVvC9]. Cell Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Liver-derived circulating nicotinamide from nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD +) catabolism primarily feeds systemic organs for NAD + synthesis. We surprisingly found that, despite blunted hepatic NAD + and nicotinamide production in liver-specific nicotinamide nucleotide adenylyltransferase 1 (NMNAT1) deletion mice (liver-specific knockout [LKO]), circulating nicotinamide and extra-hepatic organs' NAD + are unaffected. Metabolomics reveals a massive accumulation of a novel molecule in the LKO liver, which we identify as nicotinic acid riboside (NaR). We further demonstrate cytosolic 5'-nucleotidase II (NT5C2) as the NaR-producing enzyme. The liver releases NaR to the bloodstream, and kidneys take up NaR to synthesize NAD + through nicotinamide riboside kinase 1 (NRK1) and replenish circulating nicotinamide. Serum NaR levels decline with aging, whereas oral NaR supplementation in aged mice boosts serum nicotinamide and multi-organ NAD +, including kidneys, and reduces kidney inflammation and albuminuria. Thus, the liver-kidney axis maintains systemic NAD + homeostasis via circulating NaR, and NaR supplement ameliorates aging-associated NAD + decline and kidney dysfunction.

### The use of a systems approach to increase NADin human participants [^116Hk65J]. Npj Aging (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

We aimed to improve on current approaches to increasing systemic NAD + levels by formulating a dietary supplement (NT) based on targeting multiple points in the network of NAD + metabolism. We provided the substrate for NAD + synthesis though the salvage pathway as NAM, a compound present in a normal diet. Uniquely, we aimed to overcome limitations with current approaches that fail to address the root causes of NAD + decline, namely a reported age-related decline in NAMPT, the rate-limiting enzyme essential for endogenous NAD + recycling. Our approach to achieving this was to include in NT alpha lipoic acid and rutin, both of which have been reported to activate NAMPT. Significantly, a measured increase in the expression of NAMPT in PBMCs of participants while taking NT, but not placebo, demonstrated the efficacy of the supplement to achieve this key, target outcome.

Our trial was afforded particular statistical power by being of crossover design. Compared with placebo, NT increased NAD + concentration in whole blood at each of 4 weekly sampling time points. Also, changes in established ageing-related markers, including SIRT1 protein in PBMCs and pro-inflammatory cytokines in plasma, in a direction favourable to slower ageing were observed in parallel.

Participants in this study spanned an age range of 21–72 y. While not designed to test an effect of age on response, we nonetheless analysed the data for any evidence that age had any effect on the increase in whole blood NAD + concentration achieved. We found no statistically significant correlation between participant age and the size of the increase in NAD + in response to NT (R = 1.64; p = 0.229 by Spearman's rank correlation). Also, analysis by Student's unpaired t -test does not show that the age profile of the 4 participants who showed the biggest increases in whole blood NAD + concentration (40 y, 59 y, 61 y, 66 y -mean 56.5 ± 11.4 years (mean ± SD)) differs significantly from that of the other participants (46 ± 15.0 years (mean ± SD)) (p = 0.20).

### NAD depletion in skeletal muscle does not compromise muscle function or accelerate aging [^113UKzbL]. Cell Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) is a ubiquitous electron carrier essential for energy metabolism and post-translational modification of numerous regulatory proteins. Dysregulations of NAD metabolism are widely regarded as detrimental to health, with NAD depletion commonly implicated in aging. However, the extent to which cellular NAD concentration can decline without adverse consequences remains unclear. To investigate this, we generated a mouse model in which nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT)-mediated NAD + biosynthesis was disrupted in adult skeletal muscle. The intervention resulted in an 85% reduction in muscle NAD + abundance while maintaining tissue integrity and functionality, as demonstrated by preserved muscle morphology, contractility, and exercise tolerance. This absence of functional impairments was further supported by intact mitochondrial respiratory capacity and unaltered muscle transcriptomic and proteomic profiles. Furthermore, lifelong NAD depletion did not accelerate muscle aging or impair whole-body metabolism. Collectively, these findings suggest that NAD depletion does not contribute to age-related decline in skeletal muscle function.

### Nicotinamide riboside supplementation alters body composition and skeletal muscle acetylcarnitine concentrations in healthy obese humans [^114so9Uf]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Nicotinamide riboside (NR) is a naturally occurring vitamin B-3 present in the human diet that acts as an NAD + precursor and is suggested to improve mitochondrial function and insulin sensitivity. NR acts via activation of the NAD + -dependent sirtuin enzyme family, thereby regulating oxidative metabolism. In vitro experiments of NR supplementation have shown its successful NAD + -restoring capability and subsequent increased oxidative gene expression in skeletal muscle cells. Results from in vivo mouse models have shown improvements in insulin sensitivity and oxidative energy metabolism, including enhanced metabolic flexibility, increased aerobic exercise capacity, and indications of improved mitochondrial biogenesis. In these mouse models NR seems to specifically act on muscle, liver, heart, and brown adipose tissue. Reports indicate that NAD + metabolism, including NAD + concentrations, decreases in obese and older populations. The number of human interventions with NR is small and the evidence that NR may have beneficial effects in humans is limited. Human pharmacokinetic studies showed increased circulatory NAD + metabolite concentrations in whole blood, peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and urine after various dosages of NR supplementation, varying from 300 to 2000 mg/d, indicating that NR supplementation is able to increase the NAD + pool in humans. So far, 3 randomized placebo-controlled NR supplementation studies have been performed in humans, in which the effect of NR supplementation on human metabolic health was investigated. Dollerup et al. investigated the effect of 2000 mg NR/d for 12 wk in insulin-resistant middle-aged obese men. No effects of NR supplementation were found on insulin sensitivity, muscle mitochondrial function, or metabolic flexibility. In addition, Martens et al. investigated the effect of 1000 mg NR/d for 6 wk in healthy normal-weight middle-aged and older men and women. Besides a trend toward reduced arterial stiffness and lower blood pressure (BP) after NR supplementation, no effects were found on a wide variety of outcomes indicative of metabolic function, glucose metabolism, motor function, and exercise capacity. Furthermore, Elhassan et al. investigated the effects of 1000 mg NR/d for 3 wk in older men and showed increased skeletal muscle NAD + metabolite concentrations; however, again no effect on skeletal muscle mitochondrial function was observed. To date, the effect of NR supplementation on both insulin sensitivity and skeletal muscle mitochondrial function has only been recently published in 1 human clinical trial, as far as we know. Based on the promising preclinical findings reported until 2017, we designed a double-blinded randomized placebo-controlled crossover study in which we aimed to investigate the effect of 1000 mg NR/d supplementation on metabolic health in healthy obese or overweight men and women. The primary focus was on insulin sensitivity and muscle mitochondrial function, and secondary outcomes were related to energy metabolism and skeletal muscle NAD + metabolites. Therefore, our study expands the limited knowledge of the effect of NR supplementation on human metabolic health and aims to investigate the translational value of the previous promising preclinical findings.

### BST1 regulates nicotinamide riboside metabolism via its glycohydrolase and base-exchange activities [^115JZcPz]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD +) is an essential molecule present in all living cells. Several important metabolic pathways, including glycolysis, tricarboxylic acid cycle, and fatty acid oxidation, use NAD + as a cofactor to catalyze redox reactions by transferring electrons between NAD + (oxidized form of NAD) and NADH (reduced form of NAD). It is also used as a substrate by other cellular enzymes, such as sirtuin, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), and NAD + glycohydrolases CD38 and SARM1, to regulate various fundamental cellular processes including DNA repair, energy metabolism, epigenetic regulation, stress responses, and neuronal axon homeostasis –. Recent studies have shown that NAD + can also be used as a nucleotide analog in DNA ligation and mRNA capping mechanisms. Therefore, NAD + is a crucial molecule for maintaining cellular homeostasis under both physiological and pathological conditions. Depending on the type of tissue, mammalian cells can synthesize NAD + from tryptophan (Trp), nicotinic acid (NA), and nicotinamide (NAM) in the de novo, Preiss–Handler, and salvage pathways, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 1) –. Nicotinamide riboside (NR), nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), and nicotinic acid riboside (NAR) are also reported to be NAD + precursors in several organisms and cells –. These pathways can also be classified as amidated or deamidated pathways based on the presence or absence of an amide group in the precursor and intermediate molecules. The NAD + levels in cells are determined by the relative rates of synthesis and degradation. Studies have shown that NAD + levels are decreased in various metabolic diseases and aging. Reduced synthesis and increased degradation of NAD + by PARP and CD38 have been suggested to contribute to the decline in NAD + levels in these conditions. In fact, the expression levels of nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (Nampt), a major rate-limiting enzyme in the salvage pathway, have been shown to be decreased with age, while those of PARP and CD38 were increased. Decreased NAD + levels disturb cellular metabolism and stress responses by affecting the activities of NAD + -dependent and NAD + -utilizing enzymes, resulting in acceleration of aging. Conversely, elevated NAD + levels in tissue have been shown to have beneficial effects in both physiological and pathological conditions. Various approaches, such as supplementation with NAD + precursors, activation of NAD + biosynthetic pathways, and inhibition of NAD + degradation, have been used to increase NAD + levels in tissue. Oral administration of amidated NAD + precursors, NAM, NR, and NMN, has been demonstrated to be as an effective and practical approach to elevate NAD + levels in vivo. Of these NAD + precursors, NR is the most widely studied NAD + precursor to date. NR is safe in human, and is considered more efficient in raising NAD + levels compared to NAM and NA. Additionally, NR administration has been shown to have beneficial effects in different disease conditions in both preclinical and clinical settings. It has been reported that NR generates NAD + via the NR salvage pathway, in which NR kinase (NRK) phosphorylates NR to generate NMN, followed by the transfer of the adenyl moiety of ATP to NMN by nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase (Nmnat) to generate NAD +. Thus, NRK and Nmnat in the NR salvage pathway are considered as important enzymes for NAD + synthesis from NR. However, a previous study found that orally administered NR unexpectedly elevated levels of nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide (NAAD) and nicotinic acid mononucleotide (NAMN) in various tissues of mouse and human. Although this study demonstrated that the increased NAAD and NAMN were produced from the orally administered NR, the specific metabolic pathways involved have not yet been elucidated. According to the current knowledge of NAD + metabolic pathways, NAAD and NAMN are not formed during conversion of NR to NAD +. Recently, Shats et al.showed that orally administered NAM is deamidated into NA by the gut microbiota and contributes to the generation of deamidated NAD + metabolites, including NAAD and NAMN. The converted NA can be absorbed from the large intestine and contribute to the generation of NAAD and NAMN in different organs via the Preiss–Handler pathway. They also demonstrated that gut microbiota is necessary for NAD + production from NR. Thus, this study raises a question whether orally administered NR uses the conventional amidated pathway to elevate NAD + levels. Additionally, how these deamidated NAD + intermediates generated by gut microbiota contribute to NAD + generation after NR oral administration is still unclear.

### Nicotinamide riboside for peripheral artery disease: the NICE randomized clinical trial [^111t2uBt]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

People with lower extremity peripheral artery disease (PAD) have severe walking disability, but few effective treatments exist. In PAD, lower extremity ischemia causes insufficient oxygen and nutrient delivery to lower extremity skeletal muscle, which increases oxidative stress, damages skeletal muscle fibers, and impairs mitochondria function. –.

NAD+ is an essential coenzyme for mitochondrial respiration and a co-substrate for enzymes involved in metabolic regulation, cellular stress resistance, and DNA damage repair, such as poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). In preclinical study, NAD+ activated endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and reduced oxidative stress to increase nitric oxide abundance. Greater NAD+ abundance increased sirtuin1 (SIRT1) expression and improved skeletal muscle health, mitochondrial activity, and nitric-oxide-mediated endothelial function –. Nicotinamide riboside (NR) is a precursor to NAD+ and is available as an over-the counter supplement. In 2022, sales of NR in the U.S. exceeded 60 million dollars. In mice, oral NR, a precursor to NAD+, increased skeletal muscle SIRT-1 and mitochondrial activity and improved limb strength and running endurance. In humans, oral NR increased NAD+ abundance.

Resveratrol, a naturally occurring polyphenol, may increase SIRT1 affinity for NAD+. Therefore, the NIC otinamid E riboside with and without resveratrol to improve functioning in PAD (NICE) clinical trial tested the hypotheses that NR alone improves 6-min walk distance, compared to placebo, and that NR + resveratrol improves 6-min walk distance, compared to placebo, in people with PAD.

Here we show that NR meaningfully improves 6-min walk, and resveratrol does not add benefit to NR alone in PAD.

### NRK1 controls nicotinamide mononucleotide and nicotinamide riboside metabolism in mammalian cells [^113uX3VR]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

As a phosphorylated compound, NMN is not a vitamin precursor of NAD + but rather a biosynthetic intermediate. However, administration of NMN to mice produces multiple beneficial effects. It improves insulin sensitivity in high-fat diet-induced diabetes, protects the heart from ischaemia-reperfusion injuryand restores mitochondrial function in aged muscles. Though the phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate substrate of NAMPT has not been detected extracellularly, it has been speculated that NMN might be a circulating NAD + precursor, produced by a circulating extracellular NAMPT activity. However, there are discordant reports on circulating NMN concentrations, which have been reported to be < 50 nM by LC-tandem mass spectrometryto > 80 μM. The mechanisms by which extracellular NMN is converted to cellular NAD + also remain elusive. On the one hand, it was claimed that NMN is transported intact to hepatocytes. On the other hand, it has been proposed that extracellular dephosphorylation of NMN to nicotinamide riboside (NR) is required to elevate cellular NAD + metabolism.

NR is a recently described NAD + precursor that might overcome the problems linked to the administration of higher doses of NA and NAM. NR boosts NAD + synthesis and sirtuin activation without affecting GPR109A. NR supplementation increases lifespan in yeast, Caenorhabditis elegans and miceand improves high-fat diet-induced metabolic complications in mice. NR has recently been shown to be the favoured orally available hepatic precursor to NAD + in mice and to safely boost human NAD + metabolism in single oral doses.

NR naturally occurs in milkand its conversion to NAD + is initiated by phosphorylation of NR to NMN by NR kinases (NRKs). NRKs, encoded by the Nmrk genes, are highly conserved enzymes in all eukaryotes. In mammals there are two NRK enzymes, NRK1 and NRK2, but little is known about their physiological roles. In this study, we explore how modulation of NRK activity influences the action of NAD + precursors. For this purpose, we created NRK gain- and loss-of function cellular models as well as an Nmrk1 -deficient mouse model (NRK1KO). Our results indicate that NRKs are rate-limiting for NR metabolism in mammalian cells, and also a required enzymatic activity for conversion of exogenously administered NMN to NAD +.

### SnapShot: sirtuins, NAD, and aging [^113fWdAk]. Cell Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

Sirtuins are highly conserved nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)-dependent enzymes that regulate a wide range of biological processes, including aging, in several species.

### Metabolic profiles of cutaneous lupus have abnormalities in the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide pathway [^115JoKmX]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Figure 2
CD38 in the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD +) salvage pathway. At the cell membrane, CD38 is a NADase that catabolyses NAD + into nicotinamide (NAM). On the membranes of cellular organelles such as mitochondria, CD38 has multiple enzymatic activities by converting NAD + into cyclic ADP ribose (cADPr) as a cyclase or ADPr as a glycohydrolase, and hydrolyses cADPr to ADPr as a hydrolase. We hypothesise that increased CD38 activity in lupus can lead to decreased NAD + and cADPr levels in cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) skin, as shown in the metabolomics assay. Potential treatment strategies for CLE include NAD + supplementation through nicotinamide and CD38 antibody blockade via daratamumab and mezagitamab (labelled in green).

Lower level of NAD + in CLE skin has additional therapeutic implications. NAD + is a co-factor in multiple cellular oxidation-reduction functions important to cellular homeostasis including the generation of adenoside triphosphate (ATP). Oral nicotinamide is already being used as a supplement to treat autoimmune skin conditions and prevent non-melanoma skin cancers and can increase circulating levels of NAD +. Nicotinamide prevents ATP depletion, boosts cellular energy, improves protective responses within keratinocytes through enhancing DNA repair and anti-inflammatory effects, and enhances local cutaneous immunity. A topical version of nicotinamide has shown clinical benefit in patients with discoid lupus. In addition, NAD + boosting compounds confer anti-inflammatory effects. For example, nicotinamide riboside, an NAD + precursor, can attenuate type I IFN levels in myeloid cells in an NAD + -dependent manner, making it a potential adjunct for SLE management.

### Is there a role for novel supplements in the management of fatigue in rheumatic diseases? [^115LaGoJ]. RMD Open (2024). Medium credibility.

The impact of coupling favourable preclinical research with the ignition of social media promotion is demonstrated by the supplement resveratrol, which is frequently combined with NAD+ precursors such as NMN. Initial promising research into resveratrol, published in Nature, demonstrated anti-ageing effects in yeast, roundworms and Drosophila flies, and protective effects in mice from a high-calorie diet. At a molecular level, resveratrol activates sirtuins, a group of deacetylase enzymes that require NAD+ as a co-substrate to function. Consequently, one of the purported benefits of consuming NAD+ and resveratrol supplements together is synergistic mitochondrial activation.

However, extensive efforts to translate resveratrol from in vitro and animal models to human research have largely been unsuccessful and remain controversial. Clinical trials of resveratrol use for cancer, metabolic syndrome and neurological disorders have ambiguous results with endpoints that do not translate to clinical outcomes. Nevertheless, resveratrol's protean benefits continue to be marketed, and now, NAD+ supplements are embarking on a similar trajectory of public interest predicated on limited scientific evidence.

Human trials involving supplements that aim to replete NAD+ have only occurred with small sample sizes and many declare conflicts of interest. Trial outcomes are conflicting, and even though there are reports of self-reported drowsiness improving with NMN supplementation, the use of unvalidated outcome measures and a lack of rigorous trial design limit the generalisability of results. Although frequently aimed at bolstering mitochondrial function, there is no good evidence that this is achieved through supplementing the NAD+ pathway. There is some interest in clinical trials of NAD+ supplementation for post-COVID-19 fatigue and long-term COVID-19 syndromes but results, whether favourable or not, have yet to be published. Limited safety data are available from clinical trials, and very few reports have been made to adverse event reporting databases such as the Food and Drug Administration or the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency. Except for a single 6-month trial, all other trials of NAD+ pathway supplementation have been less than 3 months and so lack long-term safety data. In a mouse model of adjuvant-induced inflammatory arthritis, NMN supplementation actually exacerbated arthritis severity.

### Microbiome and micronutrient in ALS: from novel mechanisms to new treatments [^1156xBTu]. Neurotherapeutics (2024). Medium credibility.

Micronutrients, e.g. Vitamins, in the progression and treatment of ALS

Micronutrients, including vitamins, play a crucial role in maintaining overall health and supporting various physiological processes in the body. Microbiome can regulate the levels of micronutrients, by intervening in the biosynthetic processes and by modulating their absorption. Dietary supplementation with vitamins, such as A or B, promote beneficial genera such as Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, and Roseburia. to expand and colonize in the intestinal mucosa. There is no definitive evidence to suggest that vitamins can prevent or cure ALS, whereas research has explored the potential role of certain vitamins in managing symptoms and supporting overall health in individuals with ALS. We summarized the research of various vitamins that have been studied in ALS (Table 2, Table 3).

Table 2
Vitamin Bs in ALS.

Table 3
Vitamin D in patients with ALS and experimental models.

Vitamin Bs are known to be critical in maintaining the health of the nervous system. In the context of ALS, there is research interest in vitamin B3, particularly in the form of nicotinamide (a form of vitamin B3), in the management of ALS. Blacher et al. found that nicotinamide (Vitamin B3) and nicotinate were reduced in SOD1 G93A mice, related to dysbiosis. One of the key mechanisms through which nicotinamide may exert its potential benefits in ALS is by boosting levels of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), a coenzyme that plays a critical role in cellular energy production and various cellular processes. NAD ​+ ​has been shown to have neuroprotective effects and may help support the health and function of nerve cells. However, nicotinamide supplement did not show significant protection in the SOD1 G93A mice, compared to the SOD1 G93A mice without treatment.

### Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide biosynthesis promotes liver regeneration [^111JpiNA]. Hepatology (2017). Low credibility.

The regenerative capacity of the liver is essential for recovery from surgical resection or injuries induced by trauma or toxins. During liver regeneration, the concentration of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) falls, at least in part due to metabolic competition for precursors. To test whether NAD availability restricts the rate of liver regeneration, we supplied nicotinamide riboside (NR), an NAD precursor, in the drinking water of mice subjected to partial hepatectomy. NR increased DNA synthesis, mitotic index, and mass restoration in the regenerating livers. Intriguingly, NR also ameliorated the steatosis that normally accompanies liver regeneration. To distinguish the role of hepatocyte NAD levels from any systemic effects of NR, we generated mice overexpressing nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase, a rate-limiting enzyme for NAD synthesis, specifically in the liver. Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase overexpressing mice were mildly hyperglycemic at baseline and, similar to mice treated with NR, exhibited enhanced liver regeneration and reduced steatosis following partial hepatectomy. Conversely, mice lacking nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase in hepatocytes exhibited impaired regenerative capacity that was completely rescued by administering NR.

Conclusion

NAD availability is limiting during liver regeneration, and supplementation with precursors such as NR may be therapeutic in settings of acute liver injury. (Hepatology 2017;65:616–630).

### Nicotinamide riboside supplementation alters body composition and skeletal muscle acetylcarnitine concentrations in healthy obese humans [^1178JbMq]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

We hypothesized that NR supplementation in humans would increase NAD + availability and thereby would improve a broad range of metabolic health parameters, mainly via improving mitochondrial function. To investigate this hypothesis we performed a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, crossover study with detailed metabolic phenotyping in which we provided healthy overweight or obese men and women 1000 mg NR/d for 6 wk. In line with our hypothesis, NR supplementation did significantly increase markers of NAD + metabolism — NAAD and MeNAM — in skeletal muscle. This effect was accompanied by small but significant improvements in body composition, sleeping metabolic rate, and skeletal muscle acetylcarnitine concentrations, and a trend toward increased circulatory IL-1α concentrations. No further effects on skeletal muscle mitochondrial function, hepatic and whole body insulin sensitivity, substrate oxidation, cardiovascular health markers, and ectopic lipid accumulation were observed. However, it should be noted that many outcomes have been tested in our study and no adjustments for multiple comparisons were performed, therefore the possibility of false positive findings cannot be excluded. These results suggest that NR, at the dosage of 1000 mg/d for 6 wk, did have, albeit relatively small, effects on metabolic parameters in humans, but was not effective in boosting muscle mitochondrial function or insulin sensitivity.

Animal studies showed that NR is able to increase plasma and tissue NAD + concentrations. Also in humans, NR is able to increase circulatory NAD + metabolites after several dosages ranging from 100 mg/d to 2000 mg/d. Here, we used a dosage of 1000 mg/d for 6 wk, and in line with other data presented we did not report side effects during 6 wk 1000 mg NR/d supplementation. We investigated if NR supplementation was able to increase the NAD + metabolome in skeletal muscle tissue. In agreement with findings by Elhassan et al. and Dollerup et al. we have shown that NR supplementation increased the NAD + metabolites NAAD and MeNAM in skeletal muscle, but without an increase in total NAD + content itself. NAAD is a highly sensitive biomarker of NR supplementation and an increased NAD + synthesis rate in tissues. MeNAM is part of the NAD + degradation pathway and is a marker for increased NAD + flux. These results might suggest that NR increases NAD + turnover rate, without affecting steady-state NAD + concentrations in skeletal muscle.

### Trigonelline is an NADprecursor that improves muscle function during ageing and is reduced in human sarcopenia [^114XXrDd]. Nature Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Mitochondrial dysfunction and low nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD +) levels are hallmarks of skeletal muscle ageing and sarcopenia 1–3, but it is unclear whether these defects result from local changes or can be mediated by systemic or dietary cues. Here we report a functional link between circulating levels of the natural alkaloid trigonelline, which is structurally related to nicotinic acid 4, NAD + levels and muscle health in multiple species. In humans, serum trigonelline levels are reduced with sarcopenia and correlate positively with muscle strength and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation in skeletal muscle. Using naturally occurring and isotopically labelled trigonelline, we demonstrate that trigonelline incorporates into the NAD + pool and increases NAD + levels in Caenorhabditis elegans, mice and primary myotubes from healthy individuals and individuals with sarcopenia. Mechanistically, trigonelline does not activate GPR109A but is metabolized via the nicotinate phosphoribosyltransferase/Preiss-Handler pathway 5,6 across models. In C. elegans, trigonelline improves mitochondrial respiration and biogenesis, reduces age-related muscle wasting and increases lifespan and mobility through an NAD + -dependent mechanism requiring sirtuin. Dietary trigonelline supplementation in male mice enhances muscle strength and prevents fatigue during ageing. Collectively, we identify nutritional supplementation of trigonelline as an NAD + -boosting strategy with therapeutic potential for age-associated muscle decline.

### Evidence for a direct effect of the NAD + precursor acipimox on muscle mitochondrial function in humans [^112DsCph]. Diabetes (2015). Low credibility.

Recent preclinical studies showed the potential of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD(+)) precursors to increase oxidative phosphorylation and improve metabolic health, but human data are lacking. We hypothesize that the nicotinic acid derivative acipimox, an NAD(+) precursor, would directly affect mitochondrial function independent of reductions in nonesterified fatty acid (NEFA) concentrations. In a multicenter randomized crossover trial, 21 patients with type 2 diabetes (age 57.7 ± 1.1 years, BMI 33.4 ± 0.8 kg/m(2)) received either placebo or acipimox 250 mg three times daily dosage for 2 weeks. Acipimox treatment increased plasma NEFA levels (759 ± 44 vs. 1,135 ± 97 μmol/L for placebo vs. acipimox, P < 0.01) owing to a previously described rebound effect. As a result, skeletal muscle lipid content increased and insulin sensitivity decreased. Despite the elevated plasma NEFA levels, ex vivo mitochondrial respiration in skeletal muscle increased. Subsequently, we showed that acipimox treatment resulted in a robust elevation in expression of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial gene sets and a mitonuclear protein imbalance, which may indicate activation of the mitochondrial unfolded protein response. Further studies in C2C12 myotubes confirmed a direct effect of acipimox on NAD(+) levels, mitonuclear protein imbalance, and mitochondrial oxidative capacity. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to demonstrate that NAD(+) boosters can also directly affect skeletal muscle mitochondrial function in humans.

### Boosting NADwith a small molecule that activates NAMPT [^1133FfmT]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

NAD + plays a vital role in diverse cellular processes that govern human health and disease. The long-standing focus on NAD + as a redox enzyme cofactor has been eclipsed by recent seminal discoveries establishing NAD + as a co-substrate for sirtuins and poly-ADP-ribose polymerases (PARPs). These revelations have implicated NAD + in additional cellular processes including cell signaling, DNA repair, cell division, and epigenetics. Elevated tissue levels of NAD + were linked to salutary effects including healthy aging. Thus, there is keen interest in pharmacological and nutraceutical strategies to boost intracellular NAD + levels.

Enzymatic activities catalyzed by sirtuins and PARPs consume intracellular NAD +. Hence, a cellular biosynthetic pathway to preserve the NAD + level is imperative. In mammalian cells, the principle contributor to NAD + synthesis is the nicotinamide (NAM) salvage pathway involving sequential actions of nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) and NMN adenylyltransferases (NMNAT1-3). NAMPT forms NMN and pyrophosphate (PP) from NAM (generated by sirtuins and PARPs) and α-D-5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate (PRPP). In turn, NMNAT1-3 produce NAD + from NMN and ATP.

### The NADPARK study: a randomized phase I trial of nicotinamide riboside supplementation in Parkinson's disease [^115acmvM]. Cell Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

We conducted a double-blinded phase I clinical trial to establish whether nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) replenishment therapy, via oral intake of nicotinamide riboside (NR), is safe, augments cerebral NAD levels, and impacts cerebral metabolism in Parkinson's disease (PD). Thirty newly diagnosed, treatment-naive patients received 1,000 mg NR or placebo for 30 days. NR treatment was well tolerated and led to a significant, but variable, increase in cerebral NAD levels-measured by 31 phosphorous magnetic resonance spectroscopy-and related metabolites in the cerebrospinal fluid. NR recipients showing increased brain NAD levels exhibited altered cerebral metabolism, measured by 18 fluoro-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography, and this was associated with mild clinical improvement. NR augmented the NAD metabolome and induced transcriptional upregulation of processes related to mitochondrial, lysosomal, and proteasomal function in blood cells and/or skeletal muscle. Furthermore, NR decreased the levels of inflammatory cytokines in serum and cerebrospinal fluid. Our findings nominate NR as a potential neuroprotective therapy for PD, warranting further investigation in larger trials.

### Too old for healthy aging? Exploring age limits of longevity treatments [^116wEhHk]. Npj Metabolic Health and Disease (2024). Medium credibility.

Chapter 2: Is there a solution for the elderly? Stress-reducing interventions work well late in life

Because some of the most effective longevity treatments appear to lose efficacy at old age due to aging-associated decline of energy metabolism, it becomes critical to identify interventions that act independently of age. These remedies should ideally (a) not rely on mechanisms which fail with age such as the ability of mitochondria to respond to stressors and (b) better focus on prevalent metabolic deficits of old organisms such as lowered ATP production and depletion of energy depots. Interestingly, interventions that combine these two features are indeed effective at any age as discussed below and summarized in Fig. 3.

Fig. 3
Interventions that blunt anabolism thus reducing metabolic damage build-up and/or directly boost mitochondrial health are effective independently of age.

The figure lays out a mechanism, which connects the reduction of ribosome biogenesis by either rapamycin treatment or direct inactivation of Pol I to healthy longevity. As ribosome biogenesis is highly energy consuming (∼60% of total cellular ATP expenditure), its blunting liberates ATP reserves and reduces energy expenditure. Cells respond to drastically reduced energy demand by slowing down the consumption of triglyceride (TAG) reserves thus reducing the flux of fatty acids (FA) into mitochondria and dampening OXPHOS. Lowered OXPHOS levels downregulate mitochondrial stress and ROS production and thereby reduce the build-up of metabolic damage. This direct "de-stressing" of mitochondria is effective independently of age and elicits benefits even very late in life. Similar mitochondrial "de-stressing" and improvement of mitochondrial health can be achieved in both young and old organisms by supplementation of NAD+ precursors via NAD+-dependent epigenetic de-repression of the genes implicated in mitochondrial biogenesis and quality control.

### The use of a systems approach to increase NADin human participants [^111NyF38]. Npj Aging (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Changes in many interrelated cellular processes and metabolic functions contribute to ageing. The key changes identified as underpinning cellular ageing are collectively known as the hallmarks of ageing. Cellular senescence, mitochondrial dysfunction and deregulated nutrient sensing are among those studied most intensively, and chronically low NAD + (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) has been identified as a central mediator of multiple hallmarks of ageing. Interventions to prevent or reverse ageing-related changes in these variables, processes and pathways, or to stimulate counteracting cellular pathways, are made with the aim to slow or reverse the process of ageing and thus increase years of healthy life.

NAD + is an attractive target point of intervention because, as the conduit of reducing power between the fundamental metabolic pathways of glycolysis, the TCA cycle and the mitochondrial electron transport chain, it plays a central role in the generation of cellular energy (ATP). Also, a sizable body of data provides evidence for an age-related decline in NAD + levels in tissues including plasma and muscle, though this is not a universally consistent observation (reviewed in ref.). Also, NAD + depletion is a feature of some diseases of accelerated ageing, including Ataxia Telangiectasia (AT), Xeroderma Pigmentosum group A (XPA), and Cockayne Syndrome (CS) (reviewed in ref.). NAD + is also a cofactor for a number of enzymes, including enzymes with functions that impinge on cellular processes that have a role in ageing. Among these, the sirtuins are of likely particular importance. These enzymes, of which there are seven human members, are a family of deacylases and ADP-ribosyltransferases. SIRT1, the first named of the mammalian sirtuin family and the most extensively studied, catalyses the deacetylation of protein substrates at lysine residues in a reaction in which NAD + is cleaved to release nicotinamide (NAM; see ref.for recent review), and, like some other members of the family, catalyses the deacetylation of a range of substrates that have functions in a myriad of processes that impinge on ageing (see ref.for a recent review). These include the transcription factor PGC1α (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator), which is activated as a result to stimulate mitochondrial biogenesis among other cellular processes, members of the FOXO family of transcription factors, resulting in downstream beneficial effects on glucose metabolism and insulin signalling, and NF-κβ, with consequent tempering of pro-inflammatory pathways.

### Nicotinamide enhances treg differentiation by promoting foxp3 acetylation in immune thrombocytopenia [^116iAqte]. British Journal of Haematology (2024). Medium credibility.

Imbalanced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD +) homeostasis has been reported in multiple autoimmune diseases and supplementation with NAD + precursors has consistently demonstrated positive therapeutic benefits for these conditions. Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an acquired autoimmune disease, in which the decreased number and impaired function of regulatory T cells (Tregs) contribute to the main pathogenesis. Here we found NAD + level was decreased in the plasma and CD4 + T cells of ITP patients. Supplementation with NAD + precursor nicotinamide (NAM), but not nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), increased Treg frequency and ameliorated thrombocytopenia in an ITP murine model. Moreover, whilst both NAM and NMN restored cytosolic NAD + level in the CD4 + T cells from ITP patients, only NAM promoted Treg differentiation. Mechanistically, Sirtuin1 (Sirt1), a major consumer of NAD +, was highly expressed in the CD4 + T cells of ITP patients, potentially contributing to the low level of NAD +. NAM, which could act as Sirt1 inhibitor, promoted Foxp3 acetylation and stability in induced Tregs derived from naïve CD4 + T cells of ITP patients. These findings suggest that NAM holds promise as a novel therapeutic strategy for restoring immune balance in ITP.

### Nutraceutical activation of sirt1: a review [^111av5Hi]. Open Heart (2022). Medium credibility.

The deacetylase sirtuin 1 (Sirt1), activated by calorie restriction and fasting, exerts several complementary effects on cellular function that are favourable to healthspan; it is often thought of as an 'anti-aging' enzyme. Practical measures which might boost Sirt1 activity are therefore of considerable interest. A number of nutraceuticals have potential in this regard. Nutraceuticals reported to enhance Sirt1 synthesis or protein expression include ferulic acid, tetrahydrocurcumin, urolithin A, melatonin, astaxanthin, carnosic acid and neochlorogenic acid. The half-life of Sirt1 protein can be enhanced with the natural nicotinamide catabolite N1-methylnicotinamide. The availability of Sirt1's obligate substrate NAD+ can be increased in several ways: nicotinamide riboside and nicotinamide mononucleotide can function as substrates for NAD+ synthesis; activators of AMP-activated kinase — such as berberine — can increase expression of nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase, which is rate limiting for NAD+ synthesis; and nutraceutical quinones such as thymoquinone and pyrroloquinoline quinone can boost NAD+ by promoting oxidation of NADH. Induced ketosis — as via ingestion of medium-chain triglycerides — can increase NAD+ in the brain by lessening the reduction of NAD+ mediated by glycolysis. Post-translational modifications of Sirt1 by O-GlcNAcylation or sulfonation can increase its activity, suggesting that administration of glucosamine or of agents promoting hydrogen sulfide synthesis may aid Sirt1 activity. Although resveratrol has poor pharmacokinetics, it can bind to Sirt1 and activate it allosterically — as can so-called sirtuin-activating compound drugs. Since oxidative stress can reduce Sirt1 activity in multiple ways, effective antioxidant supplementation that blunts such stress may also help preserve Sirt1 activity in some circumstances. Combination nutraceutical regimens providing physiologically meaningful doses of several of these agents, capable of activating Sirt1 in complementary ways, may have considerable potential for health promotion. Such measures may also amplify the benefits of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors in non-diabetic disorders, as these benefits appear to reflect upregulation of Sirt1 and AMP-activated protein kinase activities.

### Blood levels of nicotinic acid negatively correlate with hearing ability in healthy older men [^112jYrBX]. BMC Geriatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Extension of healthy life expectancy has become a key challenge with the aging of the population. Age is a risk factor for several diseases, such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and Alzheimer's disease. Aging and age-related diseases has been reported to be closely associated with age-related decline in blood and tissue nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD +) content. Moreover, preclinical studies revealed that the administration of NAD + -related metabolites, such as nicotinamide (NAM), nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), or nicotinamide riboside (NR), reverses the aging-related decline in physiological function and prevents the onset of age-related diseases partly via the activation of NAD + dependent deacetylase sirtuin. If the correlation between NAD + -related metabolites and any specific aging-related disorders in humans are demonstrated, the application of NAD + replenishment to them can be expected.
