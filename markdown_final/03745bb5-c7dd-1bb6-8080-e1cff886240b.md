## Question

GFR 76 and cystatin

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to interpret an estimated GFR of 76 mL/min/1.73 m² in the context of cystatin C testing, including whether cystatin C is indicated, how to interpret discordance, and what actions to take next. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what an eGFR of 76 means for CKD staging and risk. Then, I should verify when cystatin C is recommended to refine GFR estimation. Next, I will examine how to interpret discordance between creatinine- and cystatin C–based eGFR and its prognostic implications. After that, I need to check non-GFR determinants that can bias each marker. Finally, I will outline practical next steps, including when to use combined eGFR or measured GFR, and how to monitor over time.

> Let me first confirm the clinical significance of an eGFR of 76 mL/min/1.73 m². By KDIGO CKD classification, an eGFR ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m² is considered normal or high, so 76 falls into CKD G1/G2 and would not meet criteria for CKD on GFR alone unless there is albuminuria or another marker of kidney damage, which means I should not jump to conclusions about CKD solely from this number [^c8463285].

> Wait, let me verify when cystatin C is actually indicated here. Guidelines recommend adding cystatin C when eGFRcr is expected to be inaccurate or when a more accurate GFR estimate will change management, particularly around the 45–59 mL/min/1.73 m² range or when muscle mass, diet, or medications may confound creatinine; at 76, cystatin C is not routinely indicated unless there is clinical uncertainty or a specific decision hinges on precision, such as dosing narrow-therapeutic-index drugs or confirming suspected CKD in the setting of atypical body composition or inflammation [^02fbc0e4] [^fb147f6f] [^cf7d366c].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about accuracy just because the number looks "normal". I should double-check the magnitude of individual-level error in eGFRcr. Population-level agreement can look acceptable, but individual eGFRcr can differ from measured GFR by more than 30% in a substantial fraction of patients, so a "normal" eGFRcr of 76 could still mask true GFR anywhere roughly 53–99 mL/min/1.73 m², which is why discordance with cystatin C can be informative even when the creatinine-based estimate is "normal" [^ed162cc3] [^1a99e6b5].

> I will now examine the prognostic implications of discordance if cystatin C is measured and yields a materially different eGFR. Large cohort data show that when eGFRcys is at least 30% lower than eGFRcr, risks of mortality, cardiovascular events, heart failure, and kidney failure are higher, even when eGFRcr is ≥ 60; conversely, when eGFRcys is higher than eGFRcr, risks tend to be lower, suggesting that cystatin C captures risk signals that creatinine can miss in some individuals [^92d195fa] [^f3f60355].

> Let me consider non-GFR determinants that could bias creatinine and cystatin C in opposite directions. Creatinine is influenced by muscle mass, diet, and tubular secretion, so low muscle mass can overestimate GFR, whereas cystatin C is less affected by muscle but can be elevated with inflammation, obesity, thyroid dysfunction, smoking, and corticosteroids; therefore, if eGFRcys is lower than eGFRcr, I should confirm whether inflammation, adiposity, or endocrine factors are present before concluding true GFR is lower [^595c75e4] [^906897bb] [^22718beb].

> Next, I should review what to do if cystatin C is measured and shows discordance. If eGFRcys is more than 20% different from eGFRcr, I should repeat both markers on the same sample to exclude analytical error, interpret the results in clinical context, and consider using the combined creatinine–cystatin C equation, which is consistently more accurate than either marker alone; if the clinical decision requires high precision, such as dosing nephrotoxic or narrow-therapeutic-index drugs, I should proceed to measured GFR using an exogenous marker rather than relying on estimates [^02fbc0e4] [^b2ca25e0] [^ff591d11].

> But wait, what if the patient is older, has low muscle mass, or is on medications that affect creatinine secretion? In those scenarios, cystatin C–based eGFR or the combined equation is preferred to mitigate creatinine bias; conversely, if there is marked inflammation, thyroid disease, or exogenous steroids, I should be cautious about interpreting a high cystatin C as reduced GFR and consider repeating testing after addressing the confounder or using measured GFR when feasible [^18f3e4ad] [^595c75e4].

> I should confirm how to monitor over time. If discordance is present, serial measurement of both creatinine and cystatin C can track divergence, which itself carries prognostic information; changes in the gap between eGFRcys and eGFRcr correlate with mortality and ESRD risk, so documenting and trending that difference can refine risk stratification beyond a single static eGFR value [^fd16e6ce] [^964f883f].

> Let me reconsider the bottom line for this case. With an eGFRcr of 76, CKD is not diagnosed by GFR alone in the absence of albuminuria or other markers, and routine cystatin C is not mandated; however, if there is clinical uncertainty about kidney function, atypical body composition, confounding by diet or medications, or a high-stakes decision requiring precise GFR, then adding cystatin C and using the combined equation is reasonable, and a meaningful discordance should trigger confirmatory strategies rather than automatic reclassification of CKD stage [^c8463285] [^02fbc0e4] [^b2ca25e0].

---

An eGFR of 76 mL/min/1.73 m² is **normal or mildly reduced** and does not alone indicate CKD. Cystatin C can improve GFR estimation when creatinine is unreliable or when **discordance** is suspected, especially in older adults, those with low muscle mass, or when narrow-therapeutic-index drugs are used. If eGFRcys is significantly lower than eGFRcr, it may reveal **true CKD** or higher cardiovascular risk; if similar or higher, it supports preserved kidney function. Use **eGFRcr-cys** when available for more accurate staging and risk assessment, and consider mGFR if critical decisions depend on precise GFR [^02fbc0e4] [^b2ca25e0].

---

## Clinical significance of eGFR 76 mL/min/1.73 m²

By KDIGO, an eGFR ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m² is **normal or mildly reduced** and does not meet CKD criteria unless albuminuria or other kidney damage is present. Thus, 76 mL/min/1.73 m² is **not diagnostic of CKD** on its own.

---

## Limitations of creatinine-based eGFR

Creatinine-based eGFR can be biased by muscle mass, diet, age, sex, and tubular secretion; in older adults or those with low muscle mass, **eGFRcr may overestimate true GFR**, masking CKD.

---

## Role of cystatin C in GFR estimation

Cystatin C is less affected by muscle mass, diet, and sex, and is **more sensitive to mild GFR reductions**. It is useful when eGFRcr is unreliable or when discordance is suspected.

---

## Interpretation of cystatin C in the context of eGFR 76

When eGFRcr is 76, cystatin C helps detect **early CKD** or refine risk:

- **eGFRcys similar to eGFRcr**: supports preserved function and low likelihood of CKD.
- **eGFRcys significantly lower than eGFRcr**: suggests true GFR reduction or higher cardiovascular risk.
- **eGFRcys higher than eGFRcr**: less common, may reflect low muscle mass or creatinine underproduction.

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

KDIGO 2024 recommends using **eGFRcr-cys** when available for more accurate GFR estimation, especially when eGFRcr is unreliable or when clinical decisions require greater precision [^02fbc0e4] [^b2ca25e0]. Cystatin C is particularly useful in older adults, those with low muscle mass, or when dosing narrow-therapeutic-index drugs [^18f3e4ad] [^cf7d366c].

---

## Clinical implications of discordance between eGFRcr and eGFRcys

Discordance is common and carries prognostic meaning: when **eGFRcys is ≥ 30% lower than eGFRcr**, mortality, cardiovascular events, and kidney failure risks are higher [^92d195fa]. Monitoring both markers over time improves risk stratification [^964f883f].

---

## Practical clinical approach

- **Initial assessment**: Use eGFRcr; if reliable and no discordance, no immediate need for cystatin C.
- **When to add cystatin C**: Use if eGFRcr is unreliable, discordance is suspected, or high-stakes decisions require precise GFR [^02fbc0e4].
- **Interpretation**: Compare eGFRcr and eGFRcys; use eGFRcr-cys for staging and risk assessment [^b2ca25e0].
- **Further testing**: Consider mGFR if critical decisions depend on accurate GFR [^22e8c64f].

---

## Conclusion

An eGFR of 76 mL/min/1.73 m² is **not diagnostic of CKD**. Cystatin C helps when creatinine is unreliable or discordant, improving detection of early CKD and refining risk. Use **eGFRcr-cys** when available, and escalate to mGFR when precision is essential.

Kidney function monitoring using creatinine-based glomerular filtration rate estimation is a routine part of clinical practice. Emerging evidence has shown that cystatin C may improve classification of glomerular filtration rate for defining chronic kidney disease in certain clinical populations and assist in understanding the complications of chronic kidney disease. In this review and update, we summarize the overall literature on cystatin C, critically evaluate recent high-impact studies, highlight the role of cystatin C in recent kidney disease guidelines, and suggest a practical approach for clinicians to incorporate cystatin C into practice. We conclude by addressing frequently asked questions related to implementing cystatin C use in a clinical setting.

Key Points

Question

Does estimation of kidney function by cystatin C level improve risk-stratification for cardiovascular disease and mortality?

Findings

In this cohort study, patients with estimated glomerular filtration rate based on serum creatinine level less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 were at low or high risk of future cardiovascular disease and death. Estimated glomerular filtration rate based on cystatin C acurately stratified risk in these individuals.

Meaning

The findings of this study suggest that, in the absence of cystatin C testing, estimated glomerular filtration rate inadequately distinguishes the broader risks associated with mild chronic kidney disease based on serum creatinine level.

Conclusions

The association of elevated circulating levels of cystatin C with adverse medium‐ and long‐term outcomes underscores the importance of CKD as a cardiovascular risk factor in our aging societies. However, our data also support the additional prognostic value for major CVD events and long‐term mortality of measurement of circulating cystatin C beyond allowing improved assessment of eGFR.

The KDOQI Work Group agrees with the practice points that endorse both UACR and eGFR for CKD testing, with confirmatory repeat testing in those found incidentally to have elevated UACR or low eGFR, and while they agree that cystatin C should be combined with Scr to provide the most reliable estimation of GFR, if these results are readily available to impact critical medical or medication-related decision making, both Scr (cr) and cystatin C (cys) should be obtained at the same time and used to estimate the GFR (eGFRcr-cys).

### GFR estimating equations: getting closer to the truth? [^13e443dd]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

The application of serum creatinine and cystatin C in patients with CKD has been limited to using estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Criteria for choosing the best GFR estimating equation are 1) accuracy in estimating measured GFR, 2) optimal discrimination of clinical outcomes, and 3) association with CKD risk factors and outcomes similar to that of measured GFR. Notably, these criteria are often not in agreement; and while the last criterion is the most important, it has been widely overlooked. The primary problem with eGFR is that the non-GFR determinants of serum creatinine and cystatin C, as well as their surrogates (age, sex, and race), associate with CKD risk factors and outcomes. This leads to a distorted understanding of CKD, though eGFR based on serum creatinine appears to be less biased than eGFR based on cystatin C. Because of this problem, the use of eGFR should be limited to settings where knowing actual GFR is relevant and eGFR is more informative about GFR than serum creatinine or cystatin C alone. Such settings include staging CKD severity by GFR and dosing medications cleared by glomerular filtration. Alternatively, the diagnosis of CKD, the longitudinal progression of CKD, and prognostic models for CKD are settings where serum creatinine and cystatin C can be better applied and interpreted without eGFR.

Results

There were 428 402 participants with median age of 57 (IQR, 50–63) years, 237 173 (55.4%) were women, and 191 229 (44.6%) were men. Among 76 629 older participants (median follow-up, 11.4; IQR, 10.6–12.1 years), there were 9335 deaths, 5205 CVD events (2158 CVD-associated deaths), and 46 kidney failure events. Among 351 773 younger participants (median follow-up, 11.6; IQR, 10.9–12.3 years), there were 14 776 deaths, 9328 CVD events (3117 CVD-associated deaths), and 124 kidney failure events.

Baseline Characteristics

Compared with individuals without evidence of CKD by any criterion, those with evidence of CKD G3 by both eGFRcr and eGFRcys were more likely to have baseline diabetes and hypertension and to use blood pressure– and cholesterol-lowering medications. Similarly, participants with evidence of CKD G3 by eGFRcys (Table) and eGFRcr-cys (eTable 1 in the Supplement) had a higher prevalence of baseline comorbidities and medication use compared with those with CKD G3 by eGFRcr only.

This recommendation places a high value on using estimates of GFR derived from a combination of creatinine and cystatin C in clinical situations where eGFRcr is an unreliable or inadequate assessment of GFR, and there is consistent evidence that eGFRcr-cys provides more accurate estimates of mGFR than eGFRcr and eGFRcys in ambulatory people.

### Understanding estimated glomerular filtration rate: implications for identifying chronic kidney disease [^eceecd84]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) can be estimated using serum markers such as serum creatinine (SCr) or cystatin C. This review presents new insights into estimated GFR based on theory, validation studies, SCr assay standardization, cystatin C, and longitudinal comparison with measured GFR.

Recent Findings

The estimation of GFR by SCr differs in health and in chronic kidney disease (CKD) due to differences in GFR range and in creatinine production between these two populations. Among populations with normal baseline GFR, there is a more rapid decline in measured GFR than in SCr-based estimated GFR. While elevated SCr is specific for CKD, other disease processes may lead to elevated cystatin C. Validation is improved by refitting equation coefficients to compare populations, recognizing the asymmetry between estimated GFR and measured GFR, and using residual plots instead of Bland-Altman plots to assess bias.

Summary

As a screening test, SCr should be interpreted as a marker of CKD probability in the context of the patient's clinical presentation. Measured GFR or creatinine clearance may be helpful in high-risk patients with normal SCr levels. GFR estimating equations should be reserved for patients with identified CKD. Standardized SCr and cystatin C assays are needed.

Guidance to clinicians — framework and when to obtain mGFR: A framework is described beginning with an initial test and followed by additional supportive tests, with an algorithm that starts from an initial test using eGFRcr and then decisions for supportive tests such as cystatin C or mGFR; healthcare providers should consider both potential sources of error in eGFR and whether the clinical decision requires a highly accurate GFR, as the level of accuracy needed for potentially toxic medications or narrow therapeutic window therapies may exceed the capability of any eGFR equation, and in such cases, mGFR should be performed, ideally reassessed every time such a treatment is initiated or adjusted.

### Quantifying individual-level inaccuracy in glomerular filtration rate estimation: a cross-sectional study [^ed162cc3]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Although the population-level differences between estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and measured glomerular filtration rate (mGFR) are well recognized, the magnitude and potential clinical implications of individual-level differences are unknown.

Objective

To quantify the magnitude and consequences of the individual-level differences between mGFRs and eGFRs.

Design

Cross-sectional study.

Setting

Four U.S. community-based epidemiologic cohort studies with mGFR.

Patients

3223 participants in 4 studies.

Measurements

The GFRs were measured using urinary iothalamate and plasma iohexol clearance; the eGFR was calculated from serum creatinine concentration alone (eGFR CR) and with cystatin C. All GFR results are presented as mL/min/1.73 m².

Results

The participants' mean age was 59 years; 32% were Black, 55% were women, and the mean mGFR was 68. The population-level differences between mGFR and eGFR CR were small; the median difference (mGFR - eGFR) was -0.6 (95% CI, -1.2 to -0.2); however, the individual-level differences were large. At an eGFR CR of 60, 50% of mGFRs ranged from 52 to 67, 80% from 45 to 76, and 95% from 36 to 87. At an eGFR CR of 30, 50% of mGFRs ranged from 27 to 38, 80% from 23 to 44, and 95% from 17 to 54. Substantial disagreement in chronic kidney disease staging by mGFR and eGFR CR was present. Among those with eGFR CR of 45 to 59, 36% had mGFR greater than 60 whereas 20% had mGFR less than 45; among those with eGFR CR of 15 to 29, 30% had mGFR greater than 30 and 5% had mGFR less than 15. The eGFR based on cystatin C did not provide substantial improvement.

Limitation

Single measurement of mGFR and serum markers without short-term replicates.

Conclusion

A substantial individual-level discrepancy exists between the mGFR and the eGFR. Laboratories reporting eGFR should consider including the extent of this uncertainty to avoid misinterpretation of eGFR as an mGFR replacement.

KDIGO 2024 CKD — eGFR uncertainty and laboratory measurement quality — eGFR is an imperfect estimate of measured GFR (mGFR), with the report stating, "At best, 90% of eGFR will fall within 30% of mGFR". Uncertainty can be mitigated because "Optimization of laboratory measurements of creatinine and cystatin C can help to reduce the uncertainty inherent in GFR estimation", and laboratories must address "accuracy… imprecision… and specificity". Performance targets align to biologic variation since "Analytical variability that is less than half the within-person biological variability is generally considered desirable", and use of international reference standards for creatinine and cystatin C "help to ensure the accuracy of results".

### The complexity of kidney disease and diagnosing it-cystatin C, selective glomerular hypofiltration syndromes and proteome regulation [^9664d3c7]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Knowledge of kidney function, expressed as glomerular filtration rate (GFR), is pivotal in most clinical situations. Measuring GFR involves invasive and cumbersome procedures, and estimations of GFR (eGFR) based on the plasma or serum level of endogenous marker molecules are therefore widely applied in clinical practice. Although creatinine has been used for this purpose since the late 1950s, it was not until 1979 that studies of the plasma concentration of cystatin C, then called γ‐trace, indicated that this protein might serve as an alternative to creatinine for an estimation of GFR. Early investigations of cystatin C, as a marker of GFR, suggested that a raised plasma level not only indicated a reduction in GFR but also significant changes in the human proteome in patients with kidney disease. Further studies of cystatin C have shown that the protein in many respects is superior to creatinine as a marker of GFR. In addition, recent investigations of cystatin C and kidney disease have demonstrated that mere GFR‐determination is insufficient to diagnose a significant part of kidney disorders and must be supplemented with measurements of the quality of the glomerular filtrate. These observations strongly urge the necessity to complement present recommendations for detecting kidney diseases (i.e. measurement, or estimation, of GFR, and determining the presence and level of albuminuria) with analysis of cystatin C to identify defects in the glomerular filtration process and the subsequent proteome changes in kidney disorders. This review describes those observations in the studies of cystatin C and kidney disorders, which prompt these conclusions.

GFR evaluation approach in chronic kidney disease — initial testing and supportive options: The first method to evaluate GFR should be eGFRcr, with subsequent supportive tests if needed for greater accuracy from either the more accurate eGFRcr-cys or measurement of GFR using urinary or plasma clearance of exogenous filtration markers; the guideline emphasizes the use of eGFRcr-cys based on accumulating evidence for its greater accuracy across populations and the use of mGFR, and highlights the importance of standardization of assays for creatinine and cystatin C and quality control procedures for exogenous markers.

### Cystatin C is ready for clinical use [^cc7c2fb9]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The goal of this update is to raise awareness of clinical scenarios where cystatin C has clear and immediate benefits as an alternative glomerular filtration rate (GFR) biomarker to supplement creatinine. An additional goal is to focus the estimated GFR (eGFR) controversy onto medication prescribing for agents with narrow therapeutic windows where better GFR estimation will lead to improved medical care.

Recent Findings

Equations that include cystatin C predict GFR more accurately than serum creatinine in children, adults, and older adults with larger effects among persons who are acutely ill. Numerous studies have evaluated medication dosing based on either GFR estimate; vancomycin was the most frequently studied drug and its target level and elimination were better predicted by cystatin C. Overall, approaches to medication dosing and monitoring that include cystatin C concentrations have been shown to result in a better achievement of drug trough levels. Furthermore, cystatin C offers the opportunity to avoid the race coefficient that is required for any current creatinine-based eGFR equation, which has been appropriately criticized for introducing unnecessary imprecision, assumptions and values on GFR estimation.

Summary

Hospital laboratories must make cystatin C available for clinical care to improve the safety and efficacy of medications that have narrow therapeutic windows.

There is no consistent definition of what constitutes renal progression in the literature. Many studies have used a doubling of serum creatinine, corresponding to an approximate halving of GFR, as an end-point defining progression, but this is insufficiently sensitive to be useful in clinical practice. Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) have defined progression as a move to a higher disease category (e.g. stage 3A [GFR 45–59 mL/min/1.73 m²] to stage 3B [GFR30-44 mL/min/1.73 m²]) confirmed by a fall in GFR of greater than or equal to 25%, an increase in albuminuria, a greater than 25% decline in GFR (e.g. a decline from 60 mL/min/1.73 m² to less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m²) or a greater than 10%/year decline in GFR (e.g. a decline from 60 mL/min/1.73 m² to less than 54 mL/min/1.73 m² in one year). NICE defined progression as a decline in GFR of more than 5 mL/min/1.73 m²/year, or more than 10 mL/min/1.73 m² averaged over 5 years.

Progression is not necessarily common even amongst people with known CKD e.g. amongst people with stage 3 CKD only 1.3% progressed to stage 5 CKD (established renal failure, typically requiring dialysis or transplantation) over 5 years. Amongst community dwelling older (greater than 65 years) adults with stage 3 CKD mean GFR declines of 3.6 mL/min/1.73 m²/year and 2.8 mL/min/1.73 m²/year have been reported respectively in male and female subjects with diabetes and somewhat lower values amongst subjects without diabetes (1.9 mL/min/1.73 m²/year and 1.1 mL/min/1.73 m²/year amongst males and females respectively). In the REIN study proteinuric (greater than 1 g/24 h) non-diabetic subjects with GFRs in the approximate range 30–50 mL/min/1.73 m² showed a decline of GFR of 7.0 mL/min/1.73 m²/year with slightly lower values being observed in those receiving renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) blockade.

This recommendation places a high value on using estimates of GFR derived from a combination of creatinine and cystatin C in clinical situations where eGFRcr is an unreliable or inadequate assessment of GFR, and there is consistent evidence that eGFRcr-cys provides more accurate estimates of mGFR than eGFRcr and eGFRcys in ambulatory people.

### Assessment of cystatin C level for risk stratification in adults with chronic kidney disease [^f3f60355]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Conclusions

In this study, categorization of CKD by eGFRcr alone included a large proportion of low-risk individuals and failed to capture a substantial proportion of individuals at higher risk for CVD and mortality. Testing using eGFRcys is more sensitive than eGFRcr and improves the specificity of diagnosis of high-risk CKD, where there are substantially higher risks of CVD and death than of kidney failure. These findings suggest that, in the absence of cystatin C testing, eGFRcr inadequately detects the broader risks associated with mild CKD.

### Medication-related AEs and discordancies in cystatin C-based vs serum creatinine-based eGFR in patients with cancer… [^22718beb]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

Logistic regression models were used to estimate the association between baseline characteristics and having a cystatin C–based eGFR that was more than 30% lower than the serum creatinine–based eGFR or an eGFRcys that was more than 30% higher than the eGFRcr. Cystatin C is a low-molecular-weight protein produced by all nucleated cells that has been increasingly used as an alternative to SCr to estimate GFR. 2, 5, 7 Cystatin C is not readily affected by age, sex, muscle mass, or diet; however, there are non-GFR factors associated with cystatin C. It is elevated in acute inflammation, obesity, and thyroid disease and with corticosteroid use. 8–11 A recent large study in patients with solid tumors found that SCr overestimated GFR, cystatin C underestimated GFR, and an equation that combines both SCr and cystatin C was the most accurate and precise way to estimate GFR. 12, 13.

In a cohort of 1869 patients with cancer with simultaneous SCr and cystatin C measurement as a part of clinical care, discordancies between eGFRcr and eGFRcys were common. We found a considerably higher rate of supratherapeutic drug levels and AEs associated with select renally cleared medications and increased risk of death in patients with an eGFRcys that was more than 30% lower than the eGFRcr compared with patients with a concordant eGFR or those whose eGFRcys was more than 30% higher than the eGFRcr. There have been conflicting reports regarding the use of SCr vs cystatin C to estimate digoxin clearance. 37–41 Herein, we found that patients with an eGFRcys that was more than 30% lower than the eGFRcr were more likely to have supratherapeutic digoxin trough levels, and 2 patients had symptomatic digoxin toxic effects.

Consistent with prior knowledge that incorporation of cystatin C adds precision to the eGFR equation in patients with malnutrition, sarcopenia, and cirrhosis, 12, 44, 45 we found that hypoalbuminemia and anemia had an important role in detecting an eGFRcys that was more than 30% lower than the eGFRcr in patients with cancer.

### How best to estimate glomerular filtration rate? Novel filtration markers and their application [^b28217d0]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Chronic kidney disease is an increasing health burden. Estimating equations using serum concentrations of creatinine and cystatin C facilitate the assessment of kidney function as reflected in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Reduced eGFR is associated with increased risk for numerous adverse outcomes and is an important aspect in many clinical situations. However, current equations are suboptimal in some clinical settings. The review focuses on approaches to improve the estimation of GFR and aims to familiarize the reader with the underlying methodological hypotheses how new markers could contribute to improve the overall performance of estimating equations.

Recent Findings

Low molecular weight proteins such as β-trace-protein and β-2-microglobulin, as well as newly discovered metabolites, show promise as new filtration markers, as they might be beneficial in populations in which creatinine or cystatin C are inaccurate. We propose that the combination of multiple novel markers, alone or in combination with creatinine, cystatin C or demographics, can potentially improve GFR estimation. For special populations such as dialysis patients, separate equations have been developed to estimate residual kidney function.

Summary

Current GFR estimating equations are an essential part of routine clinical practice but have limitations. The use of multiple markers combined in a single equation appears to be the most promising approach. Future research is required to validate proposed equations in diverse populations.

KDIGO 2024 CKD — Practice Point 1.2.2.6 (cystatin C–based eGFR): Consider the use of cystatin C–based estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFRcys) in some specific circumstances. The combination of eGFRcr and eGFRcys together is more accurate than eGFRcr or eGFRcys alone, and when there is discordance, eGFRcr-cys is more accurate than either eGFRcr or eGFRcys. In individuals where non-GFR determinants of creatinine or cystatin C are substantially greater than for the other marker, eGFRcr-cys would not provide the more accurate estimate and, in such cases, it would be reasonable to use eGFRcys. When eGFRcr and eGFRcys are discordant, it is reasonable to continue to measure cystatin C serially in addition to creatinine in those settings where GFR will affect clinical decisions, and it is also reasonable to consider performing/ conducting mGFR when using medications with narrow therapeutic index or high toxicity or to inform critical treatment decisions.

Errors often arise from "non-GFR determinants of either creatinine or cystatin C"; for creatinine these include "generation by diet and muscle mass, tubular secretion, and extrarenal elimination", while for cystatin C they are "thought to be higher adiposity, smoking, hypo- and hyperthyroidism, glucocorticoid excess, and chronic inflammation (as indicated by insulin resistance, higher levels of C-reactive protein and tumor necrosis factor, or lower levels of serum albumin)".

### Cystatin C as a biomarker for estimating glomerular filtration rate [^5ade0b91]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is rarely measured in clinical practice because of the complexity of the measurement. As such, kidney function is typically estimated using validated study equations, which use readily available data including age, sex, race, and serum creatinine as filtration marker. Contemporary research suggests that cystatin C may be an improved alternative to creatinine for inclusion in GFR estimating equations. The purpose of this article is to evaluate the benefits and limitations of using cystatin C as a biomarker of filtration.

Recent Findings

Cystatin C has fewer non-GFR determinants, when compared with serum creatinine. Use of serum cystatin C avoids the limitations related to both diet and muscle mass that affect serum creatinine. Cystatin C may be more accurate than serum creatinine in estimating GFR, and is more strongly associated with all-cause mortality and cardiovascular events.

Summary

Cystatin C has some advantages over serum creatinine in estimating GFR. The use of cystatin C as a confirmatory biomarker in deciding medication dosages or as a confirmatory test in patients with an uncertain diagnosis of chronic kidney disease may be beneficial.

### Discordance in creatinine-and cystatin C-based eGFR and clinical outcomes: a meta-analysis [^92d195fa]. JAMA (2025). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Estimated glomerular filtration rates (eGFRs) can differ according to whether creatinine or cystatin C is used for the eGFR calculation, but the prevalence and importance of these differences remain unclear.

Objectives

To evaluate the prevalence of a discordance between cystatin C-based eGFR (eGFRcys) and creatinine-based eGFR (eGFRcr), identify characteristics associated with greater discordance, and evaluate associations of discordance with adverse outcomes.

Data Sources

Participants in the Chronic Kidney Disease Prognosis Consortium (CKD-PC).

Study Selection

Participants with concurrent cystatin C and creatinine measurements and clinical outcome measurement.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Between April 2024 and August 2025, data were synthesized using individual-level meta-analysis.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary independent measurement was a large negative eGFR difference (eGFRdiff), defined as an eGFRcys that was at least 30% lower than eGFRcr. Secondary (dependent) outcomes included all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, heart failure, and kidney failure with replacement therapy.

Results

A total of 821 327 individuals from 23 outpatient cohorts (mean [SD] age, 59 [12] years; 48% female; 13.5% with diabetes; 40% with hypertension) and 39 639 individuals from 2 inpatient cohorts (mean [SD] age, 67 [16] years; 31% female; 30% with diabetes; 72% with hypertension) were included. Among outpatient participants, 11% had a large negative eGFRdiff (range, 3%-50%). Among inpatients, 35% had a large negative eGFRdiff. Among outpatient participants, at a mean (SD) follow-up of 11 (4) years, a large negative eGFRdiff, compared with an eGFRdiff between -30% and 30%, was associated with higher rates of all-cause mortality (28.4 vs 16.8 per 1000 person-years [PY]; hazard ratio [HR], 1.69 [95% CI, 1.57–1.82]), cardiovascular mortality (6.1 vs 3.8 per 1000 PY; HR, 1.61 [95% CI, 1.48–1.76]), atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (13.3 vs 9.8 per 1000 PY; HR, 1.35 [95% CI, 1.27–1.44]), heart failure (13.2 vs 8.6 per 1000 PY; HR, 1.54 [95% CI, 1.40–1.68]), and kidney failure with replacement therapy (2.7 vs 2.1 per 1000 PY; HR, 1.29 [95% CI, 1.13–1.47]).

Conclusions and Relevance

In the CKD-PC, 11% of outpatient participants and 35% of hospitalized patients had an eGFRcys that was at least 30% lower than their eGFRcr. In the outpatient setting, presence of eGFRcys at least 30% lower than eGFRcr was associated with significantly higher rates of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular events, and kidney failure.

### Cystatin C as a marker of glomerular filtration rate: prospects and limitations [^b0a251d3]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

There is much interest in cystatin C to replace or supplement serum creatinine to estimate the glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Here we review the performance of cystatin C and combined creatinine-cystatin C estimating equations compared to creatinine-based estimating equations in chronic and acute kidney disease.

Recent Findings

Drift in the cystatin C assay has had a large effect on the results reported using cystatin C, but these issues are not routinely considered in evaluation of GFR-estimating equations. The recently released primary reference material for cystatin C will allow less difference among assays in the future. There does not appear to be a consistent message among published studies as to whether cystatin C-based equations are better than creatinine-based equations in the general population or those with chronic kidney disease (CKD), as well as those with reduced muscle mass or chronic illness, or acute kidney injury. Cystatin C could be used in combination with creatinine as a confirmatory test for estimated GFR from creatinine.

Summary

Cystatin C may have a role to estimate GFR in selected circumstances, and the next set of studies should be directed at developing implementation strategies for its use.

### Association between elevated cystatin C levels and obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea syndrome: a systematic review and updated meta-analysis [^36373771]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) is a sleep-breathing disorder marked by recurrent upper airway obstruction. Intermittent hypoxemia caused by frequent apnea and hypopnea during sleep in patients with OSAHS is accompanied by a series of systemic pathophysiological changes. Recently, there has been a growing global concern regarding the systemic damage inflicted by OSAHS, particularly its detrimental effects on the cardiovascular system. However, there are fewer studies on renal damage by OSAHS. The kidney, characterized by its high blood flow and perfusion rates, is particularly sensitive to fluctuations in oxygen supply, rendering it susceptible to hypoxic injury. Therefore, the kidney stands as one of the significant target organs damaged in patients with OSAHS. However, due to the atypical clinical manifestations of early renal function injury caused by OSAHS, it is challenging to detect positive results in routine examinations, resulting in misdiagnosis or missed diagnosis.

In clinical practice, the main index for evaluating the overall renal function is the glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Key indicators frequently utilized to estimate GFR include serum urea nitrogen and serum creatinine levels. Despite widespread use in clinical practice, these indicators suffer shortcomings and have a low detection rate for early renal function impairment. In recent years, cystatin C has been recognized as a highly sensitive indicator for evaluating changes in GFR. Canales MT et al. employed cystatin C as an assessment marker for renal impairment, highlighting a higher proportion of sleep apnea in elderly individuals with elevated cystatin C levels. Serum cystatin C has been determined as an earlier and more sensitive biomarker for detecting renal impairment. Emerging investigations have revealed a prominent link between OSAHS and elevated cystatin C levels in patients without chronic kidney disease. However, some studies indicated that elevated cystatin C was only present in patients with severe OSAHS. Therefore, meta-analysis is needed for further evaluation. This study executed a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies reporting serum/plasma cystatin C levels in patients with OSAHS across varying degrees of disease severity. The aim was to explore the link between this biomarker and OSAHS. In addition, differences in cystatin C levels between daytime and nighttime were analyzed. Further, the impact of CPAP on serum cystatin C levels in patients with OSAHS was evaluated. Overall, these findings help to provide new treatment strategies and risk assessment methods for patients with OSAHS.

### Serum cystatin C as a marker of glomerular filtration rate [^886cc64a]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Glomerular filtration rate is widely accepted as the best overall measure of kidney function. Currently available methods to estimate glomerular filtration rate have strengths and limitations. Cystatin C is a novel endogenous filtration marker being considered as a potential replacement for serum creatinine. This review summarizes the currently available glomerular filtration rate estimating equations based on cystatin C and the literature comparing cystatin C and creatinine as filtration markers.

Recent Findings

In most cystatin C estimating equations, inclusion of age and sex did not substantially improve their performance. Equations yield different glomerular filtration rate estimates for the same level of cystatin C. Variation among equations may be due to differences among the assays or populations in the individual studies. Studies comparing cystatin C with creatinine or creatinine-based estimating equations show heterogeneous results, with some showing improved performance and others showing equivalent performance even in similar populations. These heterogeneous results may be due to inappropriate comparisons between equations developed in one population with those developed in another, or to the differences between assays or population characteristics.

Summary

Cystatin C shows promise as an alternative to serum creatinine but several important questions remain before it can be recommended for use in clinical practice.

KDIGO 2024 CKD — Approach to glomerular filtration rate (GFR) evaluation uses an initial creatinine-based estimate with supportive testing when greater accuracy is needed. The initial test for the evaluation of GFR is creatinine-based estimated GFR (eGFRcr). If eGFRcr is expected to be inaccurate, or a more accurate assessment of GFR is needed for clinical decision-making, then, if available, cystatin C should be measured, and creatinine and cystatin C–based estimated GFR (eGFRcr-cys) should be estimated; if eGFRcr-cys is expected to be inaccurate, or if an even more accurate assessment is needed, then, if available, GFR should be measured using plasma or urinary clearance of exogenous filtration markers. Initial test may be estimated GFR by cystatin C (eGFRcys or eGFRcr-cys) in otherwise healthy populations with changes in creatinine generation due to non-GFR determinants, and sources of error in eGFRcr-cys include very low muscle mass, very high levels of inflammation, high catabolic states, or exogenous steroid use.

"Use of cystatin C in combined creatinine-cystatin C GFR equations can also further improve GFR estimation, but cystatin C measurement adds significantly to the cost", and despite per-patient increases being "relatively small", system-wide implementation has "significant cost implications". Implementation notes include: "Resource limitations that may restrict access to enzymatic creatinine should not be seen as a barrier" to Jaffe-based programs; for cystatin C, "Ideally, cystatin C will be available for timely same-day results", achievable locally or as a "reflexed test in centralized laboratories", with analyzers that "will allow turnaround time for results as rapid as that for routine electrolytes and creatinine when provided locally"; timeliness affects use because "if results are available on the same day, then the test is more likely to be useful for routine or urgent decisions".

### Estimating glomerular filtration rate: is it good enough? And is it time to move on? [^98203710]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The aim is to examine a dominant narrative in nephrology over the past decade: that measured glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is the gold standard measure of kidney function; accurate assessment of GFR is critical and paramount; and further efforts to refine GFR estimation should continue.

Recent Findings

Studies that have simultaneously compared measured GFR and estimated GFR (using endogenous filtration markers such as creatinine, or newer ones such as cystatin C or β-trace protein) against some external metric of kidney function have failed to show that measured GFR is consistently superior, which is what one would expect if measured GFR were truly the 'gold standard'.
Summary

Compared with estimated GFR, measured GFR does not consistently predict renal-related outcomes better. Clinical decision-making almost never requires precise and accurate knowledge of a patient's static GFR value. Efforts at perfecting cross-sectional estimates of GFR may have reached a point of diminishing returns.

Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) evaluation using initial and supportive tests begins with creatinine-based estimated GFR (eGFRcr) as the initial test; if eGFRcr is expected to be inaccurate or a more accurate assessment is needed for clinical decision-making, "cystatin C should be measured, and creatinine and cystatin C–based estimated GFR (eGFRcr-cys) should be estimated"; if eGFRcr-cys is expected to be inaccurate or an even more accurate assessment is needed, "measured GFR should be measured using plasma or urinary clearance of exogenous filtration markers". In otherwise healthy populations without changes in creatinine generation due to non-GFR determinants, "Initial test may be estimated GFR by cystatin C (eGFRcys or eGFRcr-cys)", and "Sources of error in eGFRcr-cys include very low muscle mass or very high levels of inflammation, high catabolic states, or exogenous steroid use", so "Consider eGFRcys rather than eGFRcr-cys in otherwise healthy populations with decreased creatinine generation due to reduced muscle mass or decreased creatinine secretion or external elimination due to the use of specific medications".

### Assessment of cystatin C level for risk stratification in adults with chronic kidney disease [^e803b4bd]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes guidelines recommended estimation of glomerular filtration rate based on cystatin C level (eGFRcys) testing for confirmation of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in the absence of other markers of kidney damage and in circumstances when estimated glomerular filtration rate is based on serum creatinine (eGFRcr) level may be less accurate. Glomerular filtration rate decreases with age; however, muscle mass and activity are the main determinants of serum creatinine levels at fixed GFR. Older people tend to have lower muscle mass, leading to lower creatinine generation, which may result in overestimation of GFR. These competing factors lead eGFRcr to have potential discordance with eGFRcys, which may be especially pronounced in older adults. Furthermore, eGFRcys has a greater association vs eGFRcr with future risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and death. However, the recommendation to conduct concordance testing for CKD with cystatin C is rarely implemented.

To examine whether the use of cystatin C as a concordance test for CKD could improve detection of high-risk CKD, we compared the estimated prevalence of CKD based on eGFRcr, eGFRcys, and parallel analysis (eGFRcr-cys) among people with an eGFRcr greater than or equal to 45 mL/min/1.73 m² and no albuminuria. We stratified the analyses by age to assess whether concordance testing had similar value in younger compared with older adults. We hypothesized that there would be substantially higher risk for adverse outcomes (including CVD, all-cause mortality, and kidney failure) in the subset of patients with CKD confirmed by eGFRcys testing.

Relative and absolute risks associated with CKD — Very low levels of SCr often represent poor health status, such as frailty or sarcopenia, and because creatinine is related to muscle mass, this limits prognostic utility, reducing risk associations for eGFRcr 45–60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 and elevating risks for eGFRcr > 110 ml/min per 1.73 m2; these limitations are not observed with eGFRcr-cys or cystatin C–based eGFR (eGFRcys). When comparing filtration markers, risk gradients are consistently stronger for most outcomes for eGFRcys than for eGFRcr; therefore, for evaluating the association of eGFR with outcomes, the eGFRcys or eGFRcr-cys can be considered more accurate.

Relative and absolute risks associated with CKD — Very low serum creatinine (SCr) limits prognostic utility and results in reducing the risk associations for eGFRcr 45–60 ml/min per 1.73 m² and elevating risks for eGFRcr > 110 ml/min per 1.73 m², whereas these limitations are not observed when risk is estimated using eGFRcr-cys or cystatin C–based eGFR (eGFRcys). When comparing GFR estimates using these 2 filtration markers, risk gradients are consistently stronger for most outcomes for eGFRcys in comparison with eGFRcr; therefore, for the purpose of evaluating the association of eGFR with outcomes (i.e., projecting prognosis for people with CKD), the eGFRcys or eGFRcr-cys can be considered more accurate.

### Association of intraindividual difference in estimated glomerular filtration rate by creatinine vs cystatin C and end-stage kidney disease and mortality [^fd16e6ce]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Current practice guidelines for CKD recommend measuring cystatin C when precision of eGFR is required and suggest adding cystatin C for confirmatory testing in situations when creatinine is less accurate, such as in persons who may underproduce creatinine because they are frail. As efforts advance to improve CKD detection and monitoring and to eliminate the use of race in estimating kidney function, cystatin C will be increasingly incorporated into routine clinical care, and clinicians will commonly encounter persons with large eGFRdiff cys-cr.,

Persons with large eGFRdiff cys-cr may have different risk profiles from those with similar eGFRcys and eGFRcr values. Furthermore, the eGFRdiff cys-cr would evolve if eGFRcys and eGFRcr changed at different rates over time, thus potentially offering further prognostic information. Two prior studies have demonstrated associations of baseline eGFRdiff cys-cr with mortality risk, but the implications of changes in eGFRdiff cys-cr are unknown. Furthermore, examining kidney-specific end points, such as ESKD, among a CKD population is important for determining the prognostic utility of eGFRcys as a component of eGFRdiff cys-cr. In this study, we sought to address the following questions among a cohort of individuals with CKD: (1) is eGFRdiff cys-cr at baseline independently associated with progression to ESKD and mortality; (2) compared with baseline values, do time-updated measures of eGFRdiff cys-cr yield different associations with ESKD and mortality; and (3) are longitudinal divergences between eGFRcys and eGFRcr independently associated with progression to ESKD and mortality?

### Metabolic abnormalities are present in adults with elevated serum cystatin C [^00c8d984]. Kidney International (2009). Low credibility.

Although metabolic anomalies are often seen in advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD), their presence in more mild states is unknown. We studied 6722 participants in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, dividing them into three mutually exclusive groups consisting of those having a normal or mildly reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) formula), those with normal or elevated serum cystatin C, and those with clinically relevant moderate or severely reduced eGFR (stage 3 or 4 of CKD). The prevalence of several metabolic abnormalities associated with moderate to advanced CKD was determined after standardization for age, race-ethnicity, and gender. In the absence of stage 3 or 4 CKD, patients with elevated serum cystatin C had a higher prevalence of low hemoglobin and elevated uric acid, homocysteine, phosphorus, fibrinogen, and C-reactive protein than patients with a normal serum cystatin C. Our results show that in adults with normal or mildly reduced eGFR, elevated serum cystatin C is associated with an increased prevalence of metabolic abnormalities traditionally found in moderate or severe CKD. Elevated serum cystatin C may identify patients with 'preclinical' kidney disease not detected by traditional serum creatinine measurements.

Practice point 1.2.3.1 — Given available resources, "clinical laboratories may consider the possibility of measurement of both creatinine and cystatin either as an in-house test or as a referral test". The guideline emphasizes "consistency, standardization, and comparability of laboratory measures of creatinine and cystatin C; the reporting of results and of GFR estimates; and the flagging of reported results where indicated are of paramount importance". Creatinine is commonly measured by the Jaffe method ("Globally, most creatinine measurements are undertaken using a calorimetric method [Jaffe]"), whereas "Enzymatic assays are available that are more specific for creatinine and less susceptible to chemical and chromogenic (e.g., icterus and hemolysis) interferences", and "in the majority of people, use of an enzymatic method will reduce the possibility of interference". Specimen handling affects Jaffe results: "After venipuncture, in unseparated samples, there is a gradual increase in measured SCr over time when the Jaffe method is used".

### Genetic analysis of elevated levels of creatinine and cystatin C biomarkers reveals novel genetic loci associated with kidney function [^18733109]. Human Molecular Genetics (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

The rising prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD), affecting an estimated 37 million adults in the United States, presents a significant global health challenge. CKD is typically assessed using estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR), which incorporates serum levels of biomarkers such as creatinine and cystatin C. However, these biomarkers do not directly measure kidney function; their elevation in CKD results from diminished glomerular filtration. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) based on eGFR formulas using creatinine (eGFRcre) or cystatin C (eGFRcys) have identified distinct non-overlapping loci, raising questions about whether these loci govern kidney function or biomarker metabolism. In this study, we show that GWAS on creatinine and cystatin C levels in healthy individuals reveal both nonoverlapping genetic loci impacting their metabolism as well as overlapping genetic loci associated with kidney function; whereas GWAS on elevated levels of these biomarkers uncover novel loci primarily associated with kidney function in CKD patients.

### Factors other than glomerular filtration rate affect serum cystatin C levels [^906897bb]. Kidney International (2009). Low credibility.

Cystatin C is an endogenous glomerular filtration marker hence its serum level is affected by the glomerular filtration rate (GFR). To study what other factors might affect it blood level we performed a cross-sectional analysis of 3418 patients which included a pooled dataset of clinical trial participants and a clinical population with chronic kidney disease. The serum cystatin C and creatinine levels were related to clinical and biochemical parameters and errors-in-variables models were used to account for errors in GFR measurements. The GFR was measured as the urinary clearance of 125I-iothalamate and 51Cr-EDTA. Cystatin C was determined at a single laboratory while creatinine was standardized to reference methods and these were 2.1 ± 1.1 mg/dL and 1.8 ± 0.8 mg/L, respectively. After adjustment for GFR, cystatin C was 4.3% lower for every 20 years of age, 9.2% lower for female gender but only 1.9% lower in blacks. Diabetes was associated with 8.5% higher levels of cystatin C and 3.9% lower levels of creatinine. Higher C-reactive protein and white blood cell count and lower serum albumin were associated with higher levels of cystatin C and lower levels of creatinine. Adjustment for age, gender and race had a greater effect on the association of factors with creatinine than cystatin C. Hence, we found that cystatin C is affected by factors other than GFR which should be considered when the GFR is estimated using serum levels of cystatin C.

### Creatinine-and cystatin C-based estimated glomerular filtration rate slopes for the prediction of kidney outcome: a comparative retrospective study [^325b5e03]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

This study investigated the prognostic efficacy of eGFR slopes calculated by simultaneous measurement of two endogenous filtration markers, creatinine and cystatin C levels, over a 1-year period in patients with decreased kidney function. Both eGFR slopes were effective in identifying subjects at a higher risk of ESRD, and the eGFRcr slope was not different to the eGFRcys slope as a predictor of renal outcome in patients with CKD. Although serum cystatin C level has been reported to be a better predictor of cardiovascular disease and mortality than serum creatinine level, the latter may reflect GFR trends more directly, which may be useful for proper management of renal replacement therapy.

### Association of intraindividual difference in estimated glomerular filtration rate by creatinine vs cystatin C and end-stage kidney disease and mortality [^964f883f]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Are differences between estimated glomerular filtration rate by cystatin C (eGFRcys) vs creatinine (eGFRcr) associated with the risk of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) and mortality among individuals with chronic kidney disease (CKD)?

Findings

In this cohort study of 4956 participants with CKD, differences between eGFRcys and eGFRcr identified high- and low-risk groups with more than 3-fold difference in ESKD risk and 5-fold difference in mortality risk. Divergence between eGFRcys and eGFRcr slopes over time was strongly associated with mortality risk.

Meaning

These findings suggest that among patients with CKD, longitudinal monitoring of both cystatin C and creatinine may be warranted to enhance risk stratification.

Chronic kidney disease — laboratory measurement of creatinine and cystatin C emphasizes preanalytical handling, assay selection, and precision targets. The guideline advises that serum should be removed from red blood cells within 12 hours of venipuncture when the Jaffe assay is used, notes that estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is imperfect with "At best, 90% of eGFR will fall within 30% of mGFR", and specifies that "Analytical variability that is less than half the within-person biological variability is generally considered desirable". For creatinine assays, enzymatic methods can improve estimation but "are more expensive than Jaffe assays", while for cystatin C, combined creatinine–cystatin C equations can "further improve GFR estimation" though "adds significantly to the cost", and system-wide adoption has "significant cost implications"; nonetheless, "Resource limitations… should not be seen as a barrier" to Jaffe-based programs. For cystatin C implementation, timely same-day availability may be via local or centralized testing, common analyzers support cystatin C with "turnaround time for results as rapid as that for routine electrolytes and creatinine when provided locally", and timeliness influences utilization and may increase pressure to provide local testing.

KDIGO 2024 CKD — Approach to glomerular filtration rate (GFR) evaluation using initial and supportive tests outlines a stepwise algorithm: the initial test for the evaluation of GFR is creatinine-based estimated GFR (eGFRcr); if eGFRcr is expected to be inaccurate or a more accurate assessment is needed for clinical decision-making, cystatin C should be measured and creatinine and cystatin C-based estimated GFR (eGFRcr-cys) should be estimated; if eGFRcr-cys is expected to be inaccurate or an even more accurate assessment is needed, measured GFR should be measured using plasma or urinary clearance of exogenous filtration markers. The flowchart directs users to consider sources of error and need for more accurate assessment and, based on the answer, to use eGFRcr or measure cystatin C, then to consider potential sources of error in eGFRcr-cys and decide whether to proceed with eGFRcr-cys or measure GFR. Additional notes specify that the initial test may be estimated GFR by cystatin C (eGFRcys or eGFRcr-cys) in otherwise healthy populations with non-GFR determinants affecting creatinine, list sources of error in eGFRcr-cys such as very low muscle mass, very high levels of inflammation, high catabolic states, or exogenous steroid use, and advise considering eGFRcys rather than eGFRcr-cys in otherwise healthy populations with decreased creatinine generation.

### Association of intraindividual difference in estimated glomerular filtration rate by creatinine vs cystatin C and end-stage kidney disease and mortality [^4c7a9e54]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Our findings suggest that monitoring of eGFRcys is critical for patients with the worst health status, as they are the most likely to have their eGFRcr biased by creatinine underproduction and thus to have more negative eGFRdiff cys-cr. Conversely, participants with positive eGFRdiff cys-cr or steeper declines in eGFRcr than eGFRcys (positive eGFRdiff cys-cr slope) were relatively healthy and had lower risks for ESKD and mortality. In these individuals, higher levels of physical activity and muscle mass may increase creatinine production, leading to underestimation of kidney function and overestimation of ESKD and mortality risk. Hypothetically, accounting for all non-GFR factors that may possibly affect creatinine more than cystatin C over time could explain the substantial differences in risk of adverse outcomes among patients with varying degrees of eGFRdiff cys-cr. However, eGFRdiff cys-cr captures a conglomerate of non-GFR factors that are associated with overall health status. Accurately measuring and quantifying all of these factors is both impractical and likely impossible in either well-designed research cohorts or in real-world clinical practice. Our findings show that obtaining a cystatin C measurement and assessing differences between eGFRcr and eGFRcys is a simple approach to distinguish risk among individuals with CKD.

Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) assessment implementation standards using creatinine and cystatin C specify to report eGFR with validated equations and appropriate rounding, flag low eGFR values, meet assay precision and bias targets, use enzymatic creatinine methods when possible, process specimens promptly, and co-measure creatinine with cystatin C to enable combined estimates. Specifically, "Report eGFR in addition to the serum concentrations of filtration markers using validated equations", "Report eGFR rounded to the nearest whole number and relative to a body surface area (BSA) of 1.73 m² in adults using the units ml/min per 1.73 m²", and "Reported eGFR levels < 60 ml/min per 1.73 m² should be flagged as being low". When reporting markers, follow rounding rules: "(i) SCr concentration rounded to the nearest whole number when expressed as standard international units (μmol/l) and rounded to the nearest 100th of a whole number when expressed as conventional units (mg/dl); (ii) serum cystatin C concentration rounded to the nearest 100th of a whole number when expressed as conventional units (mg/l)".

### Update on cystatin C: new insights into the importance of mild kidney dysfunction [^92b0ddb8]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Using cystatin C, a novel serum marker of kidney function, several studies have shown that mild kidney dysfunction is associated with increased risk for cardiovascular disease and mortality. Studies have questioned, however, whether cystatin C is predominantly a measure of kidney function. This review summarizes the research literature on cystatin C.

Recent Findings

One longitudinal study in patients with diabetes found cystatin C to approximate glomerular filtration rate measures over 4 years much better than creatinine. Studies in several cohorts found cystatin C to be linearly associated with mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and heart failure risk, whereas creatinine predicted increased risk only in subjects with the worst kidney function. One study, however, found that increased age, male sex, increased height and weight, smoking, and higher C-reactive protein levels were associated with cystatin C after adjustment for creatinine clearance, which may suggest nonrenal influences on cystatin C concentrations.

Summary

Cystatin C appears to capture the association of mild kidney dysfunction with increased risk for cardiovascular disease and death. Future research needs to evaluate whether cystatin C will have an important role in clinical medicine.

### Prevalence estimates for CKD using race-free equation to estimate GFR… [^c8463285]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

Classifications use the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes CKD G classifications, based on eGFR, as follows: G1 or G2, 60 mL/min/1.73 m² or greater; G3a, 45 to 59 mL/min/1.73 m²; G3b, 30 to 44 mL/min/1.73 m²; G4, 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73 m²; and G5, less than 15 mL/min/1.73 m². We calculated eGFR using serum creatinine–based CKD-EPI equations; G stage6 was calculated for eGFRs of less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m². Multiple imputation was performed for missing laboratory values. Analyses were performed with Stata version 14.
2. Additional details are in the eAppendix in the Supplement. Overall, 39 156 individuals participated in NHANES 2011–2018. An estimated
18. 1 million adults had an eGFR of less than 60 ml/min/1.73 m² using either equation. The mean age was 71 years, and an estimated 10. 5 million were female.

Transitioning from the 2009 equation to the 2021 equation resulted in more than 5 million US adults changing CKD G stage classification, mostly in moderate CKD stages. Limitations include use of single laboratory measurements. Limited numbers in some subgroups prevented precise estimates, including of complications, and prevented separate analysis of smaller racial and ethnic groups. Cystatin C levels are not available for these years. In this study, estimation of eGFR using the 2021 CKD-EPI equation resulted in substantial reclassification in CKD G stage in US adults. However, CKD-related complication prevalence estimates were not substantially altered.

### Association of intraindividual difference in estimated glomerular filtration rate by creatinine vs cystatin C and end-stage kidney disease and mortality [^bd34700f]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Conclusions

This cohort study found that substantial differences between eGFRcys and eGFRcr were common and that eGFRdiff cys-cr conveys important prognostic information that is currently missed when only eGFRcr is monitored over time. When eGFRcys and eGFRcr were discrepant by more than 15 mL/min/1.73 m², risk of ESKD and mortality was associated with whether eGFRcys was lower or higher than eGFRcr. The widening of eGFRdiff cys-cr over time, which depicted divergence between the slopes of eGFRcys and eGFRcr, captured clinically important changes in health status that manifested as significant associations with mortality risk. Our results support the clinical utility in regularly obtaining measures of cystatin C in addition to creatinine throughout the longitudinal care of persons with CKD.

### Cystatin C identifies chronic kidney disease patients at higher risk for complications [^815bdffd]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2011). Low credibility.

Although cystatin C is a stronger predictor of clinical outcomes associated with CKD than creatinine, the clinical role for cystatin C is unclear. We included 11,909 participants from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) and the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) and assessed risks for death, cardiovascular events, heart failure, and ESRD among persons categorized into mutually exclusive groups on the basis of the biomarkers that supported a diagnosis of CKD (eGFR < 60 ml/min per 1.73 m(2)): creatinine only, cystatin C only, both, or neither. We used CKD-EPI equations to estimate GFR from these biomarkers. In MESA, 9% had CKD by the creatinine-based equation only, 2% had CKD by the cystatin C-based equation only, and 4% had CKD by both equations; in CHS, these percentages were 12, 4, and 13%, respectively. Compared with those without CKD, the adjusted hazard ratios (HR) for mortality in MESA were: 0.80 (95% CI 0.50 to 1.26) for CKD by creatinine only; 3.23 (95% CI 1.84 to 5.67) for CKD by cystatin C only; and 1.93 (95% CI 1.27 to 2.92) for CKD by both; in CHS, the adjusted HR were 1.09 (95% CI 0.98 to 1.21), 1.78 (95% CI 1.53 to 2.08), and 1.74 (95% CI 1.58 to 1.93), respectively. The pattern was similar for cardiovascular disease (CVD), heart failure, and kidney failure outcomes. In conclusion, among adults diagnosed with CKD using the creatinine-based CKD-EPI equation, the adverse prognosis is limited to the subset who also have CKD according to the cystatin C-based equation. Cystatin C may have a role in identifying persons with CKD who have the highest risk for complications.

### KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease [^97545da0]. Kidney International (2024). High credibility.

KDIGO 2024 CKD — Indications for cystatin C in abnormal body habitus and muscle mass: For increased muscle mass (e.g., extreme sport/exercise or body builder), eGFRcys may be appropriate if increase in muscle mass is the only abnormality. In class III obesity, eGFRcr-cys demonstrated to be most accurate; class III obesity commonly corresponds to body mass index > 40 or > 35 kg/m2. Abbreviations used: estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), creatinine-based eGFR (eGFRcr), creatinine and cystatin C–based eGFR (eGFRcr-cys), cystatin C–based eGFR (eGFRcys), measured GFR (mGFR), serum creatinine (SCr), and serum cystatin C (SCys).

### Rounding creatinine, cystatin C or both: impact on discordance group assignment and GFR-estimating equation performance [^915760d2]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

The assumptions underlying different GFR-estimating equations can also influence eGFR accuracy, depending on the usage context. Inclusion of age and sex as variables in currently recommended GFR-estimating equations partially accounts for variability in creatinine and cystatin C levels unrelated to GFR, known as 'non-GFR determinants'. However, this inherently holds the assumption that non-GFR determinants are consistent among individuals of identical age and sex, which leaves eGFR subject to residual confounding if this assumption is not met. Moreover, there may be (unidentified) non-GFR determinants unrelated to age and sex that affect eGFR.

In summary, our findings underscore the necessity of adhering to a logical set of rules for appropriate rounding of biological measurements, a process that involves gathering the expanded uncertainty of a particular assay and identifying the number of significant decimals. For serum creatinine (in mg/dL) and cystatin C (in mg/L), this means using real numbers with two decimal places as per typical measurement imprecision of assays. Adherence to these rules will maximize accuracy in both clinical practice and research.

### Kidney function estimated from serum creatinine and cystatin C and peripheral arterial disease in NHANES 1999–2002 [^2528df8e]. European Heart Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Aims

Serum cystatin C, a novel marker of kidney function, is reported to be superior to serum creatinine as a risk factor for atherosclerotic disease, but associations may vary across vascular beds.

Methods and Results

A cross-sectional study of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and peripheral arterial disease (PAD) in 3089 adult participants aged 40+ from the 1999–2002 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Kidney function, assessed by estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), was determined from serum creatinine and cystatin C using established equations. Peripheral arterial disease defined by an ankle brachial index < 0.90. Glomerular filtration rate estimated using cystatin C was more strongly associated with PAD compared with eGFR using serum creatinine before and after multivariable adjustment. Further, after adjustment for cystatin C, kidney function based on serum creatinine was no longer significantly associated with PAD. However, cystatin C remained significantly associated with PAD even after adjustment for GFR estimated by serum creatinine. Compared with optimal kidney function (eGFR(serum creatinine) ≥ 60, eGFR(cystatin C) > 90), the odds ratio for PAD was 3.11 (95% confidence interval 1.26–7.64) for preclinical CKD (eGFR(serum creatinine) ≥ 60, eGFR(cystatin C) < 76.7) and 5.07 (3.01–8.52) for 'confirmed' CKD (eGFR(serum creatinine) < 60, eGFR(cystatin C) < 60).

Conclusion

Chronic kidney disease was strongly and independently associated with PAD. Cystatin C was a more potent marker of lower extremity PAD when compared with the serum creatinine equation currently used in clinical practice. Our results suggest that cystatin C may have clinical utility when combined with serum creatinine in evaluation of individuals who may have PAD.

### KDOQI clinical practice guidelines and clinical practice recommendations for diabetes and chronic kidney disease [^fa433080]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2007). Medium credibility.

Guideline 1. Screening and diagnosis of diabetic kidney disease — Microalbuminuria is the best available test for screening of DKD, but it is imprecise, and markers under study include urinary immunoreactive intact albumin and shed podocytes, genetic risk indicators, blood and/or urine changes in growth factors, cytokines, inflammatory markers, or markers of oxidative stress, and innovative kidney imaging or tissue studies. Appropriately weighted risk algorithms should be derived using predictive variables, including AER within the normalalbuminuric or microalbuminuric range, retinopathy status, clinical and ambulatory blood pressure measurements, glycemic control, lipid levels, age, sex, race, and family history. Improved measures of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) should be developed and may include more reliable creatinine measurement methods, modifications of existing formulas, application of new GFR markers, such as cystatin C, and development of simplified direct GFR measurements. Additional studies on urinary albumin measurements, including predictive values of gender-specific ACR cutoffs, urine collection methods, and processing of urine samples, are warranted, and research questions include the rate of progression of DKD in people with reduced GFR but normal urinary albumin excretion compared with those with elevated urinary albumin excretion, whether regression of albuminuria modifies long-term progression, the effect of promising agents to prevent RCN in CKD across both types of diabetes, and the best common definition of RCN.

### Creatinine-or cystatin C-based equations to estimate glomerular filtration in the general population: impact on the epidemiology of chronic kidney disease [^4622844e]. BMC Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusions

The present study has illustrated large discrepancies for the prevalence of stage 3 CKD according to the biomarker used to estimate the GFR. Moving from strictly creatinine-based equations (MDRD or CKD-EPI) to cystatin C-based or combined equations will decrease prevalence of stage 3 CKD by half, which is highly significant from an epidemiological point of view. Additional studies are thus necessary before asserting we know the true prevalence of CKD in the general population.
