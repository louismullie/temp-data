## Question

Hypertensive urgency in Tia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to manage hypertensive urgency in a patient with transient ischemic attack (TIA). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether this is truly hypertensive urgency versus hypertensive emergency. Then, I should verify the timing of blood pressure lowering after TIA. Next, I will review the target blood pressure goals and preferred antihypertensive classes. After that, I need to check for special situations like intracranial atherosclerosis or reperfusion therapy. Finally, I will consider monitoring, follow-up, and how to integrate this with the broader TIA workup and secondary prevention plan.

> Let me first confirm the terminology so I don't conflate urgency with emergency. Hypertensive urgency is severe blood pressure elevation, typically ≥ 180/110 mmHg, without acute target organ damage, whereas hypertensive emergency implies acute end-organ injury such as encephalopathy, acute coronary syndrome, aortic dissection, or intracerebral hemorrhage. In suspected TIA, I need to ensure there is no evolving stroke or hemorrhage on imaging before labeling this as urgency rather than emergency [^116LxkPu] [^113hBaaB].

> Wait, let me verify the timing of antihypertensive initiation after TIA, because this differs from acute ischemic stroke. I initially thought we should delay treatment for 48–72 hours as in AIS, but hold on, that's not correct for TIA; guidelines explicitly recommend initiating or intensifying antihypertensive therapy immediately after TIA, whereas in ischemic stroke we generally delay unless there are special indications, so I should correct that assumption and start BP control promptly in TIA [^116hZDnK] [^117455SV] [^1164rirV].

> Next, I should review the blood pressure target. For most patients with TIA and confirmed hypertension, a clinic target of less than 130/80 mmHg is recommended to reduce recurrent stroke and vascular events. If tolerated, some European guidance supports aiming for 120–129 mmHg, but I need to individualize based on age, comorbidities, and tolerability, and avoid excessive early lowering in frail or very elderly patients [^114odfcZ] [^114VeeqR] [^114rt2zQ] [^115et9yM].

> I will now examine which drug classes to choose. Thiazide-type diuretics, ACE inhibitors, or ARBs are preferred first-line agents after TIA because they have randomized evidence for reducing recurrent stroke; calcium channel blockers can be used for BP control but have less robust secondary stroke prevention data, so I should prioritize the former unless there is a compelling indication for CCBs or they are needed for additional control [^111LyqrD] [^111XQYd8] [^114PTvNW].

> Hold on, I should verify special scenarios that modify management. If the TIA is attributable to high-grade intracranial atherosclerosis with hemodynamic compromise, there is insufficient evidence to support permissive or induced hypertension, so I should target normotension rather than allowing higher pressures. Conversely, after successful endovascular reperfusion for large-vessel occlusion, I should avoid aggressive early lowering below 140 mmHg in the first 24–72 hours to mitigate reperfusion injury risk, which does not directly apply to a typical TIA but is important if the clinical course evolves toward thrombectomy [^117P3Kt2] [^113sfG88] [^111UvUrJ] [^116r342b].

> Let me consider the pace of blood pressure reduction. In hypertensive urgency without end-organ damage, rapid intravenous or aggressive intermittent oral dosing to acutely drop BP is not recommended; instead, I should initiate or adjust oral therapy and aim for control over 24–48 hours with close follow-up, avoiding precipitous falls that could compromise cerebral perfusion in a patient with recent cerebrovascular symptoms [^111TACCY] [^116LxkPu] [^1141GdiK].

> Next, I should review monitoring and disposition. I need to ensure the TIA workup proceeds in parallel: brain imaging, vascular imaging of the brain and neck, cardiac evaluation including rhythm monitoring for atrial fibrillation, and rapid initiation of antithrombotic and statin therapy where indicated; structured TIA clinics or expedited outpatient pathways can be as safe as inpatient care for appropriately selected patients, but I must not discharge without guaranteed early follow-up given the high early stroke risk after TIA [^1139sjXk] [^11365kHr] [^113bQT8n].

> I should double-check that my plan aligns with secondary prevention targets beyond BP. Intensive LDL lowering with high-intensity statins, antiplatelet therapy tailored to mechanism, anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation, lifestyle modification including sodium restriction and Mediterranean-style diet, and diabetes optimization all contribute to risk reduction; importantly, hypertension management is one of the most impactful modifiable interventions after TIA, reinforcing the need to act promptly and persistently [^1164rirV] [^114rZGS2] [^114KQVee].

> Putting this together, my final approach is: confirm hypertensive urgency without acute end-organ damage, initiate or intensify oral antihypertensive therapy immediately after TIA, target less than 130/80 mmHg if tolerated using a thiazide-type diuretic, ACE inhibitor, or ARB, avoid rapid BP drops or IV agents in the absence of emergency indications, and integrate this with urgent TIA evaluation and secondary prevention to mitigate the high early recurrence risk [^116hZDnK] [^114odfcZ] [^111LyqrD] [^111TACCY].

---

In TIA, hypertensive urgency (≥ 180/110 mmHg without acute target organ damage) **requires prompt but gradual BP reduction** to avoid cerebral hypoperfusion or ischemia. Immediate IV therapy is not indicated unless there is end-organ damage; instead, initiate or adjust oral agents (ACEi/ARB, thiazide, or CCB) and titrate to a target of < 130/80 mmHg if tolerated [^114odfcZ] [^114rt2zQ]. Monitor closely for neurologic changes and hypotension, and address secondary prevention in parallel [^1139sjXk].

---

## Definition and clinical significance

Hypertensive urgency is defined as **severe BP elevation (≥ 180/110 mmHg) without acute target organ damage** (e.g. encephalopathy, acute coronary syndrome, renal failure, or intracranial hemorrhage) [^notfound]. In TIA, it is common and reflects the underlying cerebrovascular risk profile; however, rapid BP reduction can precipitate cerebral hypoperfusion and worsen ischemia, so management must balance prompt control with cerebral perfusion needs [^notfound].

---

## Recommended blood pressure targets

Guidelines recommend a **target BP of < 130/80 mmHg** for most patients with TIA to reduce recurrent stroke and vascular events [^114odfcZ] [^115CvLLA]. In older adults or those with significant comorbidities, a more conservative target of < 140/90 mmHg may be reasonable, with individualized decisions based on tolerance and clinical context [^115et9yM].

---

## Pharmacological management

### Initial pharmacological approach

- **Oral antihypertensive agents**: Preferred initial therapy includes ACE inhibitors, ARBs, thiazide diuretics, or calcium channel blockers (CCBs) [^111LyqrD] [^112CxWQq].

- **Combination therapy**: Often required to achieve targets; RAS blockers combined with CCBs or thiazide-like diuretics are effective strategies [^116hZDnK].

- **Avoid rapid BP reduction**: Rapid lowering can cause cerebral hypoperfusion; aim for gradual reduction over 24–48 hours [^115TEy9r].

---

### Specific pharmacological agents and dosing

| **Medication class** | **Examples** | **Initial dose** | **Comments** |
|-|-|-|-|
| ACE inhibitors | - Lisinopril <br/> - Ramipril | - 10–20 mg daily <br/> - 2.5–5 mg daily | Effective for secondary stroke prevention [^111LyqrD] |
| ARBs | - Losartan <br/> - Valsartan | - 50–100 mg daily <br/> - 80–160 mg daily | Alternative to ACE inhibitors [^111LyqrD] |
| Thiazide diuretics | - Chlorthalidone <br/> - Hydrochlorothiazide | - 12.5–25 mg daily <br/> - 25 mg daily | Effective in combination therapy [^116hZDnK] |
| Calcium channel blockers | - Amlodipine <br/> - Diltiazem | - 5–10 mg daily <br/> - 180–240 mg daily | Useful if additional BP control needed [^111XQYd8] |

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

- **Frequent BP monitoring**: Check BP every 2–4 hours initially, then daily once stable.

- **Neurological monitoring**: Watch for recurrent TIA symptoms, stroke, or hypotension-related deficits.

- **Laboratory monitoring**: Assess renal function and electrolytes within 1–2 weeks after initiating or adjusting therapy.

- **Follow-up**: Arrange close outpatient follow-up within days to weeks to ensure BP control and adherence [^1139sjXk].

---

## Potential risks and complications

- **Cerebral hypoperfusion**: Rapid BP reduction can worsen ischemia; avoid abrupt drops [^115TEy9r].

- **Hypotension**: Monitor for dizziness, syncope, or falls, especially in older adults.

- **Medication side effects**: ACE inhibitors/ARBs can cause hyperkalemia or renal impairment; thiazides can cause hyponatremia or hypokalemia.

---

## Integration with secondary prevention strategies

Hypertension management should be integrated with other secondary prevention measures, including antiplatelet therapy, statins, lifestyle modification, and risk factor control (e.g. diabetes, smoking cessation) [^114KQVee]. Early, guideline-concordant care — including timely BP control — significantly reduces recurrent stroke and mortality after TIA [^114DCHLK] [^111yiitw].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Target BP**: < 130/80 mmHg if tolerated; < 140/90 mmHg in older adults or those with comorbidities [^114odfcZ] [^114rt2zQ].

- **Initial therapy**: Oral ACE inhibitors, ARBs, thiazide diuretics, or CCBs; combination therapy often needed [^111LyqrD] [^112CxWQq].

- **Avoid rapid reduction**: Gradual BP lowering over 24–48 hours to prevent cerebral hypoperfusion [^115TEy9r].

- **Monitoring**: Frequent BP checks, neurological assessment, and laboratory monitoring.

- **Integration**: Combine with antiplatelet therapy, statins, lifestyle changes, and risk factor control [^114KQVee].

Hypertensive urgency in TIA requires **careful, gradual BP reduction** with oral agents, close monitoring, and integration with secondary prevention to reduce recurrent stroke risk.

Hypertensive emergency BP-lowering targets — compelling condition versus no compelling condition: For adults with a hypertensive emergency related to a compelling condition, systolic BP (SBP) should be reduced to < 140 mm Hg for most conditions and to < 120 mm Hg in acute aortic dissection during the first hour while monitoring for other target organ dysfunction (1 C-LD). For adults with a hypertensive emergency but without a compelling condition, SBP should be reduced by no more than 25% within the first hour, then if stable to < 160/100 mm Hg within the next 2 to 6 hours, and then cautiously to 130 to 140 mm Hg during the next 24 to 48 hours to limit target organ injury (1 C-LD). Hypertensive emergencies in patients with acute ICH or acute ischemic stroke and in pregnant adults are addressed in separate sections.

### Current diagnosis and management of hypertensive emergency [^113hBaaB]. Seminars in Dialysis (2006). Low credibility.

The appropriate and timely evaluation and treatment of patients with severely elevated blood pressure is essential to avoid serious adverse outcomes. Most importantly, the distinction between a hypertensive emergency (crisis) and urgency needs to be made. A sudden elevation in systolic (SBP) and/or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) that is associated with acute end organ damage (cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, or renal) is defined as a hypertensive crisis or emergency. In contrast, acute elevation in SBP and/or DBP not associated with evidence of end organ damage is defined as hypertensive urgency. In patients with a hypertensive emergency, blood pressure control should be attained as expeditiously as possible with parenteral medications to prevent ongoing and potentially permanent end organ damage. In contrast, with hypertensive urgency, blood pressure control can be achieved with the use of oral medications within 24–48 hours. This paper reviews the management of hypertensive emergencies.

Transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) are common and portend a high short-term risk of stroke. Evidence-based recommendations for the urgent evaluation and treatment of patients with TIA have been published. However, implementation of these recommendations reliably and consistently will require changes in the systems of care established for TIA. The National Stroke Association convened a multidisciplinary panel of experts to develop recommendations for the essential components of systems of care at hospitals to improve the quality of care provided to patients with TIA. The panel recommends that hospitals establish standardized protocols to assure rapid and complete evaluation and treatment for patients with TIA, with particular attention to urgency and close observation in patients at high risk of stroke.

Definitions of elevated BP states

Various terminologies have been applied to describe severe elevation in BP, including acute severe hypertension, hypertensive urgency, hypertensive emergency, malignant hypertension (MHT), accelerated phase hypertension and hypertensive crisis. It is important to distinguish between the key terms to guide appropriate management and minimise the potential for iatrogenic harm.

Acute severe hypertension

The definition of 'severe' has changed progressively in the last 70 years. Most experts would accept that a BP of > 200/120 mmHg is severe, and needs urgent attention, but the degree of urgency depends on the precise circumstances. For example, a BP of 180/100 mmHg in a poorly adherent, uncontrolled chronically hypertensive patient, would not usually be considered as acute severe HTN needing immediate treatment, whereas a BP of 160/100 mmHg would be a medical (hypertensive) emergency in the context of acute end organ damage (EOD), such as preeclampsia. We prefer the term 'acute severe hypertension' to indicate patients with severe elevation in BP without evidence of acute and/or life-threatening EOD. Most patients presenting to emergency departments (ED) belong to this category and it is difficult to distinguish whether the rise in BP is acute or chronic especially if BP has not been measured recently. National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines (NG 136) refer to this subgroup as severe hypertension {NICE, 2019 }. The term 'hypertensive urgency' in patients who are asymptomatic is not necessarily useful as this can lead to undue anxiety in patients and increased costs to healthcare with low associated morbidity; we prefer to avoid the use of this term.

Hypertensive emergency

Hypertensive emergency is elevated BP, which when sustained over the next few hours may lead to progressive life-threatening EOD. It primarily includes conditions such as acute pulmonary oedema, hypertensive encephalopathy, acute renal failure, aortic dissection, intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH), severe preeclampsia/eclampsia, pheochromocytoma crisis and acute coronary syndrome (ACS). In several of these diagnoses, BP may be severely elevated though not necessarily. Even a moderate elevation of BP can be potentially life-threatening in certain situations, particularly if the elevation of BP is rapid. Rise in BP may not be the immediate causal factor in some emergency states like acute ischaemic stroke (AIS) and sub-arachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) but may co-exist and complicate management.

### Processes of care associated with risk of mortality and recurrent stroke among patients with transient ischemic attack and nonsevere ischemic stroke [^11365kHr]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Patients with transient ischemic attack (TIA) and nonsevere ischemic stroke are at high risk of recurrent vascular events. However, studies have demonstrated that timely delivery of guideline-concordant care can dramatically reduce this risk. Studies reporting risk reductions of at least 70% for recurrent events among patients with TIA or nonsevere ischemic stroke have emphasized early evaluation and management; however, these studies differed in terms of the processes of care that were provided. 4–8 The American Heart Association/American Stroke Association (AHA/ASA) stroke prevention guidelines recommend a broad range of processes, including diagnostic processes (eg, brain imaging) and secondary prevention interventions (eg, hypertension management). Our objective was to identify the guideline-concordant processes of care that were associated with a reduction in the risk of recurrent ischemic stroke or death among patients with TIA or nonsevere stroke, adjusting for baseline patient characteristics.

Previous stroke or transient ischaemic attack — RCTs of antihypertensive treatment (placebo controlled) in patients with a previous stroke or TIA, in a stable clinical condition, and with a BP > 140/90 mmHg, have shown that BP lowering reduces the risk of recurrent stroke. Evidence is not available that the recurrent stroke is prevented by initiating therapy when BP is in the high–normal range. We recommend resumption of BP-lowering therapy several days after stroke, or immediately after TIA, for previously treated or untreated patients with hypertension, for prevention of both recurrent stroke and other CV events. The recent Secondary Prevention of Small Subcortical Strokes 3 study in patients with a recent lacunar stroke suggested an SBP target of < 130 mmHg.

Secondary stroke prevention — evidence base for BP targets summarizes randomized and meta-analytic data. Data from 4 RCTs and recent meta-analyses support the benefit of treating patients with prior stroke or TIA to achieve a BP goal of < 130/80 mm Hg. Trials compared intensive control (SBP targets < 120 to < 130 mm Hg) with standard control (SBP targets < 140 to < 150 mm Hg). A meta-analysis of these trials showed a significant reduction in recurrent stroke risk with an intensive versus standard target (relative risk: 0.78 [95% CI: 0.64–0.96]). An independent Cochrane analysis reported a pooled relative risk for recurrent stroke of 0.80 [95% CI: 0.63–1.00]. The largest meta-analysis to date included > 40,000 patients from 14 RCTs.

### 2018 guidelines for the early management of patients with acute ischemic stroke: a guideline for healthcare professionals from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^115hAWk6]. Stroke (2018). Medium credibility.

Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) — blood pressure (BP) management specifies that in patients with AIS, early treatment of hypertension is indicated when required by comorbid conditions (eg, concomitant acute coronary event, acute heart failure, aortic dissection, postthrombolysis sICH, or preeclampsia/eclampsia), and lowering BP initially by 15% is probably safe. In patients with BP > 220/120 mm Hg who did not receive IV alteplase or EVT and have no comorbid conditions requiring acute antihypertensive treatment, the benefit of initiating or reinitiating treatment of hypertension within the first 48 to 72 hours is uncertain, and it might be reasonable to lower BP by 15% during the first 24 hours after onset of stroke. Although no solid data are available to guide selection of medications for BP lowering after AIS, the antihypertensive medications and doses included in Table 5 are reasonable options. Starting or restarting antihypertensive therapy during hospitalization in patients with BP > 140/90 mm Hg who are neurologically stable is safe and is reasonable to improve long-term BP control unless contraindicated.

Importance

Early evaluation and management of patients with transient ischemic attack (TIA) and nonsevere ischemic stroke improves outcomes.

Objective

To identify processes of care associated with reduced risk of death or recurrent stroke among patients with TIA or nonsevere ischemic stroke.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cohort study included all patients with TIA or nonsevere ischemic stroke at Department of Veterans Affairs emergency department or inpatient settings from October 2010 to September 2011. Multivariable logistic regression was used to model associations of processes of care and without-fail care, defined as receiving all guideline-concordant processes of care for which patients are eligible, with risk of death and recurrent stroke. Data were analyzed from March 2018 to April 2019.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Risk of all-cause mortality and recurrent ischemic stroke at 90 days and 1 year was calculated. Overall, 28 processes of care were examined. Without-fail care was assessed for 6 processes: brain imaging, carotid artery imaging, hypertension medication intensification, high- or moderate-potency statin therapy, antithrombotics, and anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation.

Results

Among 8076 patients, the mean (SD) age was 67.8 (11.6) years, 7752 patients (96.0%) were men, 5929 (73.4%) were white, 474 (6.1%) had a recurrent ischemic stroke within 90 days, 793 (10.7%) had a recurrent ischemic stroke within 1 year, 320 (4.0%) died within 90 days, and 814 (10.1%) died within 1 year. Overall, 9 processes were independently associated with lower odds of both 90-day and 1-year mortality after adjustment for multiple comparisons: carotid artery imaging (90-day adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 0.49; 95% CI, 0.38–0.63; 1-year aOR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.52–0.72), antihypertensive medication class (90-day aOR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.45–0.74; 1-year aOR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.60–0.83), lipid measurement (90-day aOR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.51–0.90; 1-year aOR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.53–0.78), lipid management (90-day aOR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.33–0.65; 1-year aOR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.53–0.85), discharged receiving statin medication (90-day aOR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.36–0.73; 1-year aOR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.55–0.88), cholesterol-lowering medication intensification (90-day aOR, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.26–0.83; 1-year aOR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.41–0.77), antithrombotics by day 2 (90-day aOR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.40–0.79; 1-year aOR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.55–0.87) or at discharge (90-day aOR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.41–0.86; 1-year aOR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.54–0.88), and neurology consultation (90-day aOR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.52–0.87; 1-year aOR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.63–0.87). Anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation was associated with lower odds of 1-year mortality only (aOR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.40–0.85). No processes were associated with reduced risk of recurrent stroke after adjustment for multiple comparisons. The rate of without-fail care was 15.3%; 1216 patients received all guideline-concordant processes of care for which they were eligible. Without-fail care was associated with a 31.2% lower odds of 1-year mortality (aOR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.55–0.87) but was not independently associated with stroke risk.

Conclusions and Relevance

Patients who received 6 readily available processes of care had lower adjusted mortality 1 year after TIA or nonsevere ischemic stroke. Clinicians caring for patients with TIA and nonsevere ischemic stroke should seek to ensure that patients receive all guideline-concordant processes of care for which they are eligible.

### Blood pressure-lowering treatment for preventing recurrent stroke, major vascular events, and dementia in patients with a history of stroke or transient ischaemic attack [^114DCHLK]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Stroke is an important cause of death and disability worldwide. Since high blood pressure is an important risk factor for stroke and stroke recurrence, drugs that lower blood pressure might play an important role in secondary stroke prevention.

Objectives

To investigate whether blood pressure-lowering drugs (BPLDs) started at least 48 hours after the index event are effective for the prevention of recurrent stroke, major vascular events, and dementia in people with stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA). Secondary objectives were to identify subgroups of people in which BPLDs are effective, and to investigate the optimum systolic blood pressure target after stroke or TIA for preventing recurrent stroke, major vascular events, and dementia.

Search Methods

In August 2017, we searched the Trials Registers of the Cochrane Stroke Group and the Cochrane Hypertension Group, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2017, Issue 8), MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to August 2017), Embase Ovid (1974 to August 2017), ClinicalTrials.gov, the ISRCTN Registry, Stroke Trials Registry, Trials Central, and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform Portal.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of BPLDs started at least 48 hours after stroke or TIA.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened all titles and abstracts, selected eligible trials, extracted the data, assessed risk of bias, and used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence. If necessary, we contacted the principal investigators or corresponding authors for additional data.

Main Results

We included 11 studies involving a total of 38,742 participants: eight studies compared BPLDs versus placebo or no treatment (35,110 participants), and three studies compared different systolic blood pressure targets (3632 participants). The risk of bias varied greatly between included studies. The pooled risk ratios (RRs) of BPLDs were 0.81 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.70 to 0.93; 8 RCTs; 35,110 participants; moderate-quality evidence), 0.90 (95% CI 0.78 to 1.04; 4 RCTs; 28,630 participants; high-quality evidence) for major vascular event, and 0.88 (95% CI 0.73 to 1.06; 2 RCTs; 6671 participants; high-quality evidence) for dementia. We mainly observed a reduced risk of recurrent stroke in the subgroup of participants using an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or a diuretic (I² statistic for subgroup differences 72.1%; P = 0.006). The pooled RRs of intensive blood pressure-lowering were 0.80 (95% CI 0.63 to 1.00) for recurrent stroke and 0.58 (95% CI 0.23 to 1.46) for major vascular event.

Authors' Conclusions

Our results support the use of BPLDs in people with stroke or TIA for reducing the risk of recurrent stroke. Current evidence is primarily derived from trials studying an ACE inhibitor or a diuretic. No definite conclusions can be drawn from current evidence regarding an optimal systolic blood pressure target after stroke or TIA.

Discussion

These results support the association of guideline-concordant processes with improved outcomes for patients with TIA and nonsevere ischemic stroke. The 6 without-fail care processes (ie, brain imaging, carotid artery imaging, antihypertensive intensification, high- or moderate-potency statin therapy, antithrombotics, and anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation) can be provided routinely at diverse medical centers because they do not require specialized structures of care. Given the strength of the prospective trial evidence as well as the current findings supporting the association of these processes with improved outcomes, health care systems should prioritize providing patients with TIA or nonsevere ischemic stroke with the guideline-concordant processes of care for which they are eligible.

The individual processes that were associated with improved outcomes included carotid stenosis management, hyperlipidemia, anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation, antithrombotics, and neurology consultation. These data support the AHA/ASA secondary prevention recommendations. Although carotid artery screening and intervention for symptomatic carotid stenosis are endorsed by guidelines, these processes are not currently the focus of existing quality measurement programs.

### Optimising secondary prevention in the acute period following a TIA of ischaemic origin [^117Q3qDi]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Background

Definition of transient ischaemic attack

Transient ischaemic attack (TIA) is defined as 'a transient episode of neurological dysfunction caused by focal brain, spinal cord or retinal ischaemia, without acute infarction'and is diagnosed by the patients' history, a neurological examination and/or neuroimaging (typically a CT head scan). Typical symptoms of TIA include the rapid onset of speech disturbance, unilateral weakness or sensory loss, monocular blindness, visual field defect or ataxia.

Aetiology of TIAs: TOAST classification system

The underlying aetiology of each TIA event can be classified as per the TOAST classification system. The TOAST classification denotes the underlying cause of the TIA event and this paper focuses on secondary prevention following a TIA due to atherosclerosis or small vessel occlusion, two TOAST subtypes.

TIA risk factors

TIAs are most commonly caused by the embolic or thrombotic consequences of atherothrombotic disease, which is similar to the underlying pathological mechanism for cardiovascular disease. In addition to sharing a similar underlying pathological mechanism, cerebrovascular and cardiovascular disease share common underlying risk factors.

The modifiable risk factors for all vascular diseases include smoking, excessive alcohol intake, physical inactivity, dietary factors, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, diabetes and obesityas well as low VO₂max.

Thus, there are several lifestyle modifications that might contribute to a substantial reduction in the risk of vascular events post-TIA and there is evidence that the earlier these interventions can be introduced, the better the outcome.

Pharmacological secondary prevention of stroke

National UK guidelines for the pharmacological treatment of TIA/stroke have been established by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)and are supplemented by guidelines on tackling individual risk factors. Following the acute diagnosis of TIA, a prophylactic daily dose of 75 mg of aspirin should be initiated and other agents, for example, dipyridamole and clopidogrel, may be added. These agents reduce blood clotting and therefore reduce the chances of a future clot forming within the circulation. Statins should be initiated to lower cholesterol levelsand appropriate antihypertensive medications are used for blood pressure controlas per national management guidelines. However, evidence is growing regarding the contribution of change in modifiable risk factors to reductions in deathsand there is a need to consider how to promote non-pharmacological measures within secondary prevention.

Many patients with transient ischemic attacks (TIA) are at high risk of stroke within the first few days of onset of symptoms. Emergency physicians and primary care physicians need to assess these patients quickly and initiate appropriate secondary stroke prevention strategies. Recent refinements in diagnostic imaging have produced valuable insight into risk stratification of patients with TIA. Clinical data regarding urgent initiation of antiplatelet therapy specifically in this patient population with non-cardioembolic TIA are limited but promising. This review outlines the diagnostic tools available for rapid assessment of patients presenting with symptoms of TIA and discusses clinical trials that apply to these vulnerable patients.

### Guidance for incorporating FDA processes into the ACC / AHA clinical practice guideline methodology: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^111Qnb7h]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Secondary stroke prevention — antihypertensive therapy recommendations specify drug classes and BP goals. For patients with hypertension who have experienced an ischemic stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA), or ICH, treatment with a thiazide-type diuretic, ACEI, or ARB is recommended for lowering BP and reducing recurrent stroke and ICH risk (1 A). For patients with hypertension who have experienced an ischemic stroke, TIA, or ICH, an office SBP/DBP goal of < 130/80 mm Hg is recommended to reduce the risk of recurrent stroke, ICH, and other vascular events (1 B-R). In patients with no history of hypertension who have experienced an ischemic stroke, TIA, or ICH and have an average office SBP/DBP of ≥ 130/80 mm Hg, antihypertensive medication treatment can be beneficial to reduce the risk of recurrent stroke, ICH, and other vascular events (2a B-R).

### Evaluation and management of transient ischemic attack: an important component of stroke prevention [^111xXH1u]. Nature Clinical Practice: Cardiovascular Medicine (2007). Medium credibility.

Stroke and transient ischemic attack (TIA) share similar risk factors and methods of evaluation and secondary prevention. As neurological symptoms resolve after TIA, however, there has been a widely held perception that urgent evaluation and treatment following TIA are unnecessary. In actual fact, it is becoming increasingly clear that the short-term stroke risk after TIA is very high. Recent studies have identified independent predictors that indicate which patients are at highest risk of recurrent ischemic events. These risk scores could enable physicians to target appropriate patients for urgent care. In this Review, we summarize the recent literature on stroke risk after TIA and risk stratification, and recently published guidelines on evaluation and treatment.

### Recent advances in management of transient ischaemic attacks and minor ischaemic strokes [^111LNK49]. The Lancet: Neurology (2006). Medium credibility.

The risk of recurrent stroke during the first few days after a transient ischaemic attack or minor stroke is much higher than previously estimated. However, there is substantial variation worldwide in how patients with suspected transient ischaemic attack or minor stroke are investigated and treated in the acute phase: some health-care systems provide immediate emergency inpatient care and others provide non-emergency outpatient clinical assessment. This review considers what is known about the early prognosis after transient ischaemic attack and minor ischaemic stroke, what factors identify individuals at particularly high early risk of stroke, and what evidence there is that urgent preventive treatment is likely to be effective in reducing the early risk of stroke.

### 2021 guideline for the prevention of stroke in patients with stroke and transient ischemic attack: a guideline from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^114VeeqR]. Stroke (2021). High credibility.

Hypertension after ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack — an office BP goal of < 130/80 mm Hg is recommended for most patients to reduce the risk of recurrent stroke and vascular events. Neurologically stable patients with cerebrovascular disease also benefit from a BP goal of < 130/80 mm Hg, but there is insufficient evidence to recommend a lower limit of BP within the normal range for patients with prior stroke. These recommendations pertain to outpatient management of neurologically stable patients. In patients with no history of hypertension who experience a stroke or TIA and have an average office BP of ≥ 130/80 mm Hg, antihypertensive medication treatment can be beneficial to reduce the risk of recurrent stroke, ICH, and other vascular events. The PAR of stroke resulting from hypertension may be as high as 50% in some racial and ethnic groups.

A transient ischemic attack (TIA) is an episode of reversible neurologic deficit caused by temporary focal central nervous system hypoperfusion. TIA is a medical emergency. Because patients with TIA in the emergency department (ED) have a high risk for stroke within the next 48 hours, it is imperative for the clinician to recognize this golden opportunity to prevent a disabling stroke. This article reviews our conceptual understanding of TIA, its definition, diagnosis, ways to stratify stroke risk, the acute management and disposition in the ED, and the potential future role of diagnostic biomarkers.

### Chinese stroke association guidelines for clinical management of ischaemic cerebrovascular diseases: executive summary and 2023 update [^113v794J]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The incidence of stroke in the Chinese population continues to rise, accounting for nearly one-fourth of the global annual stroke cases. Among adults aged 40 years or above in China, IS accounted for approximately 86.8% of all strokes. Timely updates to the guidelines can provide new evidence-based recommendations for diagnosis, acute-phase treatment, prevention and management of complications, and secondary prevention for IS.

Since the publication of the 2019 Chinese Stroke Association (CSA) guidelines, notable advancements have emerged in acute-phase reperfusion therapy and antiplatelet treatments for secondary IS prevention. The findings of several high-quality randomised controlled trials (RCTs) conducted in China will have an impact on stroke care. Some new lipid-lowering agents are also helpful in stroke prevention.

We conducted a comprehensive search of MEDLINE (via PubMed) up to 31 August 2023, and compiled the relevant information into a tabular format. The writing team established the level of recommendation through multiple rounds of online and offline discussions. Each recommendation was graded using the evidence grading algorithm developed by the CSA (table 1). The updated guideline kept the nine sections: definitions, emergency assessment and diagnosis, reperfusion therapy, antiplatelet therapy, other treatments in the acute phase, general supportive treatment and management of complications, early evaluation of the aetiology and pathogenesis, interventions targeting aetiology and pathogenesis, risk factor management and long-term intervention.

Antihypertensive drug classes after stroke or transient ischemic attack — diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor blockers have demonstrated benefit in RCTs or systematic reviews of RCTs, and although calcium channel blockers are recommended for the treatment of hypertension, there are limited data on their efficacy for secondary stroke prevention; however, the use of calcium channel blockers is reasonable for patients with stroke who require additional medication options.

### Characteristics and outcomes of patients presenting with hypertensive urgency in the office setting [^116LxkPu]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Importance

The prevalence and short-term outcomes of hypertensive urgency (systolic blood pressure ≥ 180 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 110 mm Hg) are unknown. Guidelines recommend achieving blood pressure control within 24 to 48 hours. However, some patients are referred to the emergency department (ED) or directly admitted to the hospital, and whether hospital management is associated with better outcomes is unknown.

Objectives

To describe the prevalence of hypertensive urgency and the characteristics and short-term outcomes of these patients, and to determine whether referral to the hospital is associated with better outcomes than outpatient management.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This retrospective cohort study with propensity matching included all patients presenting with hypertensive urgency to an office in the Cleveland Clinic Healthcare system from January 1, 2008, to December 31, 2013. Pregnant women and patients referred to the hospital for symptoms or treatment of other conditions were excluded. Final follow-up was completed on June 30, 2014, and data were assessed from October 31, 2014, to May 31, 2015.

Exposures

Hospital vs ambulatory blood pressure management.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) consisting of acute coronary syndrome and stroke or transient ischemic attack, uncontrolled hypertension (≥ 140/90 mm Hg), and hospital admissions.

Results

Of 2 199 019 unique patient office visits, 59 836 (4.6%) met the definition of hypertensive urgency. After excluding 851 patients, 58 535 were included. Mean (SD) age was 63.1 (15.4) years; 57.7% were women; and 76.0% were white. Mean (SD) body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) was 31.1 (7.6); mean (SD) systolic blood pressure, 182.5 (16.6) mm Hg; and mean (SD) diastolic blood pressure, 96.4 (15.8) mm Hg. In the propensity-matched analysis, the 852 patients sent home were compared with the 426 patients referred to the hospital, with no significant difference in MACE at 7 days (0 vs 2 [0.5%]; p = 0.11), 8 to 30 days (0 vs 2 [0.5%]; p = 0.11), or 6 months (8 [0.9%] vs 4 [0.9%]; P > .99). Patients sent home were more likely to have uncontrolled hypertension at 1 month (735 of 852 [86.3%] vs 349 of 426 [81.9%]; p = 0.04) but not at 6 months (393 of 608 [64.6%] vs 213 of 320 [66.6%]; p = 0.56). Patients sent home had lower hospital admission rates at 7 days (40 [4.7%] vs 35 [8.2%]; p = 0.01) and at 8 to 30 days (59 [6.9%] vs 48 [11.3%]; p = 0.009).

Conclusions and Relevance

Hypertensive urgency is common, but the rate of MACE in asymptomatic patients is very low. Visits to the ED were associated with more hospitalizations, but not improved outcomes. Most patients still had uncontrolled hypertension 6 months later.

Summary of international guidelines for hypertensive emergencies

The ESC/ESH and AHA/ACC guidelines (Table 14) state that the aim of treatment of markedly elevated BP is to intensify/reinstitute oral anti-hypertensive drug therapy and ensure adequate follow-up with acknowledgement of the lack of a robust evidence base. There is overall general agreement that a patient with acute EOD is managed as hypertensive emergency, usually treated with IV anti-hypertensive therapy, in a high dependency/intensive care environment. There is, however, heterogeneity in outlined management of patients with acute severe HTN and the pace of reduction in BP in various specific scenarios. The guidelines mostly adopt a threshold BP of 180/110–120 mmHg to define severely elevated BP. Our opinion differs in that regard, as there cannot be a single cut off value of BP that is too low to cause EOD and the corollary that not all patients with 'severely elevated BP' need immediate treatment and assessment should be directed to define and treat the EOD. It is important to treat the patient and not the numbers. The targets for BP reduction and the pace of reduction defined in several hypertensive emergency states are not based on robust evidence and are mostly based on expert opinion. It must be widely appreciated that anti-hypertensive therapy should be personalised to the patient's characteristics and the aim of treatment should be to reduce BP proportionally rather than to an arbitrary target value.

### Preventing further vascular events after a stroke or transient ischaemic attack: an update on medical management [^111sMVxT]. Practical Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

After a stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA) there is a high risk of stroke, particularly in the early days and weeks, and of other serious vascular events. Several preventive medical treatments can reduce these risks; starting them as early as possible will maximise the absolute risk reduction, as long as the diagnosis is secure, there is no known or suspected net harm from treatment, and they are acceptable to the patient. Medical treatments with clear evidence of benefit include: lowering blood pressure after all types of stroke or TIA; lowering blood cholesterol with a statin after ischaemic stroke or TIA; antiplatelet treatment after ischaemic stroke or TIA; and warfarin instead of antiplatelet treatment in patients with ischaemic stroke or TIA who have atrial fibrillation and no contraindications to anticoagulation. Lifestyle changes (for example, stopping smoking, reducing excess alcohol intake, adopting a healthy diet) and careful management of diabetes are also important.

Acute ischaemic stroke

HTN is a common risk factor for acute ischaemic stroke (AIS), and thus, many patients presenting with focal neurological defects will be hypertensive. Chronic HTN leads to a multitude of changes in the vessel wall predisposing to thrombosis. AIS may further increase BP in patients with chronic HTN to a variable degree, but it is unclear whether this is compensatory to help maintain cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), or purely detrimental. Similar to other hypertensive emergency states, a rapid large drop in BP can reduce cerebral blood flow leading to cerebral infarction or peri-haematomal ischaemia, while extremely high BP can lead to ongoing cerebral oedema, increased risk of haematoma expansion in ICH or haemorrhagic transformation. RCTs and subsequent meta-analysis show lack of benefit of reduction in BP to specified targets.

Treatment to reduce BP is recommended in specific scenarios by relevant ESC/ ESH, ESO and AHA/ACC guidelines (.

These indications include:

1. If BP is greater than > 220/120 mmHg in the acute phase, lower MAP by no more than 15% over 24 h, to maintain perfusion of the penumbra.

2. Reduction to 185/110 mmHg should be considered in those who are candidates for thrombolysis and to maintain a BP < 185/110 mmHg for at least 24 h after receiving the tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) therapy. The evidence for the relative contraindication of tPA in patients with BP > 185/ 100 mmHg is weak, based on small nonrandomised pilot studies.

3. Consider whether another emergency state/ EOD is present.

Overall, the evidence or lack of evidence here raises a debate if AIS is truly a hypertensive emergency or should be categorised as chronic EOD associated with uncontrolled HTN albeit a serious consequence (Table 7).

### Is it time to retire the diagnosis "Hypertensive emergency"? [^1145xJ1K]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Stroke

The management of high BP in patients presenting with acute stroke in emergency departments is the more controversial among the diagnosis that characterizes a hypertensive emergency. The 2017 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology hypertension guidelines divide the management by the diagnoses of acute ischemic stroke and intracerebral hemorrhage. The 2018 European Society of Cardiology/European Society of Hypertension guidelines for hypertension do not include any presentation of stroke as a criterion for diagnosing hypertensive emergencies because the beneficial effects of BP reduction in these conditions are unclear.

The management of high BP is among several steps proposed by the specific guidelines for acute cerebrovascular events. The recommendations unfold in ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes, several BP levels, and by the possibility of carrying out thrombolysis or mechanical thrombectomy. The classes of recommendations and the corresponding level of evidence in all guidelines that address the management of BP during acute stroke are mostly low (or weak) (IIa or IIb and B and C, respectively). Nonetheless, there is high uncertainty over the benefits and risks of intensive BP lowering on functional outcomes.

The various nuances of BP management during acute cerebrovascular events suggest that neurovascular specialists (or trained intensivists and emergency physicians) are needed to achieve better outcomes in these patients. The recommendations for nonspecialists should be restricted to the recognition of a cerebrovascular event in patients with acute elevation of BP and the immediate referral to a tertiary care hospital. If it is impossible to transfer a patient within the time window for thrombolysis or thrombectomy, a better alternative would be to avoid modulating BP. This option has been associated with better neurologic outcomes in patients who are not candidates for pharmacological or mechanical reperfusion.

Acute ischaemic stroke — In patients receiving i.v. thrombolysis, BP should be lowered and maintained at < 180/105 mmHg for at least the first 24 h after thrombolysis. The benefit of acute BP lowering in patients with acute ischaemic stroke who do not receive thrombolysis is uncertain; in such patients clinical judgement should define whether to interfere with drug therapy, in which case a reasonable goal may be to lower BP by 15%, with close monitoring, during the first 24 h after the stroke onset. For stable patients with no thrombolytic therapy (≥ 140/90 mmHg) ≥ 3 days after an acute ischaemic stroke, initiation or reintroduction of BP-lowering medication should be considered.

### Management of transient ischemia attacks in the twenty-first century [^114Q1jLD]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Patients who have a transient ischemic attack (TIA) represent a group that may appear well but are at high risk for stroke within 90 days. Management of patients who have a TIA requires an understanding of the short-term risk for stroke to guide acute management and the long-term benefits to medical and surgical therapies. The initial emergency department (ED) evaluation may be supplemented with simple TIA stroke risk scores to estimate short-term stroke risk. The addition of MRI provides yet more information regarding stroke risks, while identifying some specific causes of TIA. Extended testing may not be feasible in the ED, and to address this limitation, new outpatient strategies for patients who have a TIA have been developed, such as the use of an ED observation unit or an outpatient TIA clinic. Although controversy remains in some areas of acute TIA management because of the lack of evidence from controlled trials, evidence from large randomized trials have led to a better understanding of effective measures for the long-term prevention of stroke.

Recently, new screening tools, based on a single-lead ECG or a pulse wave (detected e.g. with plethysmography or oscilometric blood pressure), have emerged, but the clinical utility of majority has yet to be proven, especially in post-stroke patient. On the other hand, new hand-held or worn (belts, patches, smartphone apps) single-ECG recorders demonstrate good sensitivity and specificity. A recent multicentre RCT in patients with IS or transient ischaemic attack (TIA) demonstrated that 30-day smartphone-based ECG monitoring was better than one additional 24 h Holter monitoring in detecting ≥ 30s AF (9.5 vs. 2.0%; P = 0.024) and led to more frequent OAC use at 3 months (9.5 vs. 0%, P = 0.002).

In summary, a considerable burden of previously unknown AF can be detected when long-term monitoring is applied in at-risk patients.

Hypertension, DM, hypercholesterolaemia

Blood pressure

Hypertension is the most prevalent and modifiable risk factor for primary prevention of stroke. Most studies have also shown that control of BP is beneficial for prevention of a recurrent stroke — Supplementary material online, Table S4. The management of blood pressure in the acute phase of a stroke is more variable and depends on whether thrombolysis is administered for IS. Guidelines call for reducing systolic blood pressure (SBP) below 185 mmHg and diastolic below 110 mmHg before IV thrombolysis is started. Given the urgency of reperfusion initiation, IV BP treatments with agents such as labetalol or nicardipine are warranted with close interval BP monitoring after thrombolysis in the first 24 h and maintaining BP of less than 185/105 mmHg. Although intracerebral hemorrhage was reduced, intensive BP lowering after IV thrombolysis to SBP of 130–140 mm Hg has not been shown to improve 90-day functional outcomes compared to target SBP of < 180 mm Hg.

Stroke (2019). High credibility.

Acute ischemic stroke — blood pressure management: Hypotension and hypovolemia should be corrected to maintain systemic perfusion levels necessary to support organ function (class I, C-EO). In patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS), early treatment of hypertension is indicated when required by comorbid conditions (eg, concomitant acute coronary event, acute heart failure, aortic dissection, postfibrinolysis sICH, or preeclampsia/eclampsia) (class I, C-EO). In patients who did not receive IV alteplase or mechanical thrombectomy and have BP ≥ 220/120 mm Hg with no comorbid conditions requiring urgent antihypertensive treatment, the benefit of initiating or reinitiating treatment of hypertension within the first 48 to 72 hours is uncertain, and it might be reasonable to lower BP by 15% during the first 24 hours after onset of stroke (class IIb, C-EO). In patients with BP < 220/120 mm Hg who did not receive IV alteplase or mechanical thrombectomy and do not have a comorbid condition requiring urgent antihypertensive treatment, initiating or reinitiating treatment of hypertension within the first 48 to 72 hours after an AIS is not effective to prevent death or dependency (class III: No Benefit, A).

Results

Study Cohort

Mean age was 66.3 years, 40.5% were female, and 29.8% had a TIA as qualifying event. The median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score on admission was 2 points (Table S2; for details see also). A total of 1693 patients randomized to the intervention group had an analyzable Holter‐ECG.

Findings in the Intervention Group

At least 1 abnormal ECG finding was detected in 326 of 1693 (19.3%) patients of the intervention group, and 90 of 1693 (5.3%) patients had > 1 abnormal finding. Overall, 250 of 1693 (14.8%) patients had abnormal findings other than newly detected AF. Of 76 of 1693 (4.5%) patients with newly detected AF, 38 of 1693 (2.2%) patients had additional abnormal ECG findings. The core laboratory recommended "urgent consultation with a cardiologist" in 70 of 1693 (4.1%) patients and "a consultation with a cardiologist" in 210 of 1693 (12.4%) patients (Table 1). Baseline characteristics differed in patients with and without abnormal study ECG findings (Table 2), as patients with abnormal ECG findings were older, less likely to have an index TIA, had a higher National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score at baseline, a longer in‐hospital stay, were more likely to be pretreated with a β‐blocker, and were more likely to have coronary artery disease, renal dysfunction, or hypertension.

### Blood pressure trajectories and outcomes for veterans presenting at VA medical centers with a stroke or transient ischemic attack [^1147rYvv]. The American Journal of Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Blood pressure control has been shown to reduce risk of vascular events and mortality after an ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA). Yet, questions remain about effectiveness, timing, and targeted blood pressure reduction.

Methods

We analyzed data from a retrospective cohort of 18,837 veterans cared for 12 months prior and up to 12 months after an emergency department visit or inpatient admission for stroke or TIA. Latent class growth analysis was used to classify patients into systolic blood pressure trajectories. With Cox proportional hazard models, we examined relationships between blood pressure trajectories, intensification of antihypertensive medication, and stroke (fatal or non-fatal) and all-cause mortality in 12 months following the index event.

Results

The cohort was classified into 4 systolic blood pressure trajectories: 19% with a low systolic blood pressure trajectory (mean systolic blood pressure = 116 mm Hg); 65% with a medium systolic blood pressure trajectory (mean systolic blood pressure = 136 mm Hg); 15% with a high systolic blood pressure trajectory (mean systolic blood pressure = 158 mm Hg), and 1% with a very high trajectory (mean systolic blood pressure = 183 mm Hg). After the stroke or TIA, individuals in the high and very high systolic blood pressure trajectories experienced a substantial decrease in systolic blood pressure that coincided with intensification of antihypertensive medication. Patients with very low and very high systolic blood pressure trajectories had a significantly greater (P < .05) hazard of mortality, while medication intensification was related significantly (P < .05) to lower hazard of mortality.

Conclusions

These findings point to the importance of monitoring blood pressure over multiple time points and of instituting enhanced hypertension management after stroke or TIA, particularly for individuals with high or very high blood pressure trajectories.

Comparing the risk of subsequent stroke at 2, 7, 30, and 90 days after a TIA or mIS suggested that offering rapid management at TIA clinics is not inferior to inpatient care models. Among the identified cohort, patients who received care at TIA clinics were younger, had a higher rate of carotid stenosis, but a lower ABCD 2 score.

Our results also suggest an increased risk of subsequent stroke in patients who were treated and discharged from ED without assigned follow-up care. Previous studies have reported that patients with TIA who were discharged from ED were less likely to receive guideline-concordant care and underwent fewer timely brain and carotid imaging, monitoring for arrhythmia, and administration of preventive medications such as antithrombotic, antihypertensive, and lipid-lowering agents. The risk of recurrence can be stratified by the clinical scales (such as ABCD 2) and risk factor profiles; however, many practitioners, especially in community hospitals, rely on a one-size-fits-all approach.

However, there is growing evidence that suggests TIA clinics can be considered an alternative to hospitalization. Despite the very different structures of risk stratification and patient selection, referral patterns, and diagnostic and therapeutic protocols in these TIA clinic models, the risk of cerebral ischemia in patients treated at a TIA clinic did not exceed those treated in an inpatient setting.,

Many practice guidelines also endorse outpatient TIA management and recommend hospitalization of high-risk patients. The American Heart/American Stroke Association (AHA/ASA) guidelinerecommends an urgent evaluation and hospitalization of TIA patients if they present within 72 hours and have an ABCD 2 score of 3 or greater. The Australian National Stroke Foundation includes a set of high-risk indicators beside the ABCD 2 scoring into the triaging criteria. This guideline recommends urgent and comprehensive management of TIA by use of a local TIA pathway covering primary care, emergency, and stroke specialist teams within locally available resources. The United Kingdom national guidelineand Canadian Stroke Best Practice Recommendationsconsider the time elapsed from symptoms onset and risk of early recurrence. The United Kingdom guideline recognizes outpatient clinics to provide care for TIA patients. The Canadian guideline also states that while high-risk patients should be seen within 24 hours, providing care for other patients can be slightly delayed based on their risk scoring.

### National stroke association guidelines for the management of transient ischemic attacks [^1152cNyM]. Annals of Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

Transient ischemic attacks are common and important harbingers of subsequent stroke. Management varies widely, and most published guidelines have not been updated in several years. We sought to create comprehensive, unbiased, evidence-based guidelines for the management of patients with transient ischemic attacks.

Methods

Fifteen expert panelists were selected based on objective criteria, using publication metrics that predicted nomination by practitioners in the field. Prior published guidelines were identified through systematic review, and recommendations derived from them were rated independently for quality by the experts. Highest quality recommendations were selected and subsequently edited by the panelists using a modified Delphi approach with multiple iterations of questionnaires to reach consensus on new changes. Experts were provided systematic reviews of recent clinical studies and were asked to justify wording changes based on new evidence and to rate the final recommendations based on level of evidence and quality. No expert was allowed to contribute to recommendations on a topic for which there could be any perception of a conflict of interest.

Results

Of 257 guidelines documents identified by systematic review, 13 documents containing 137 recommendations met all entry criteria. Six iterations of questionnaires were required to reach consensus on wording of 53 final recommendations. Final recommendations covered initial management, evaluation, medical treatment, surgical treatment, and risk factor management.

Interpretation

The final recommendations on the care of patients with transient ischemic attacks emphasize the importance of urgent evaluation and treatment. The novel approach used to develop these guidelines is feasible, allows for rapid updating, and may reduce bias.

### Diagnosis and management of labile blood pressure during acute cerebrovascular accidents and other hypertensive crises [^113oL43Q]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

It is estimated that with more than 40 million adults in the United States having uncontrolled hypertension, the risk of developing ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke in this population is significant. In addition, roughly 1 of 100 patients with essential hypertension will experience a hypertensive crisis during their lifetime, and these accelerated hypertensive emergencies and urgencies complicate more than 27% of all acute medical problems in patients presenting to emergency departments (EDs) in the United States. Arterial hypertension, a prominent feature of acute stroke syndrome, usually declines spontaneously within a few days, but its presence at hospital admission or its acute development during hospitalization is often associated with worsening stroke outcome and early mortality. Control of hypertension in patients with subarachnoid and intracerebral hemorrhage, both forms of acute stroke, is directed at maintaining adequate cerebral blood flow to minimize ischemic damage and control intracerebral pressure while reducing the risk of rebleeding and developing cerebrovasospasm. Inappropriate lowering of the blood pressure in acute stroke may increase neurologic damage. However, adequate blood flow around the central area of the acute ischemic stroke or penumbra may result in ischemic cells being salvaged. Clinicians must be mindful that accelerated hypertension is associated with other types of patients seen in the ED, such as perioperative patients and patients with traumatic head injuries.

### Age-specific cerebral haemodynamic effects of early blood pressure lowering after transient ischaemic attack and non-disabling stroke [^117FL36o]. European Stroke Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Treatment of hypertension is safe and effective in elderly patients in primary prevention, – with no evidence of cerebral hypoperfusion. Blood pressure (BP) lowering after stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA) also reduces the risk of recurrent stroke, but some uncertainties remain. Firstly, there is limited evidence on the effectiveness of BP-lowering in randomised trials in older (> 80 years) patients with TIA/stroke. In most trials on antihypertensive treatment for secondary stroke prevention, including the PROGRESS trial, older patients were underrepresented. Secondly, there is uncertainty about how early antihypertensive treatment should be initiated. There is no evidence of benefit, and even possible harm, from acute initiation of treatment in major acute stroke. Although patients with TIA/non-disabling stroke are also often started on antihypertensive treatment in the acute setting, the effects of intensive blood pressure lowering on cerebral perfusion in these patients are uncertain, particularly at older ages. Small studies on TIA/stroke patients, without carotid occlusive disease showed no evidence of worsening cerebral perfusion, but observation was limited to 2 weeks after initiating BP-lowering, and few older patients were studied. Reduced cerebral blood flow at older ages could place elderly patients at higher risk of cerebral hypoperfusion, particularly those with decreased diastolic flow and increased cerebrovascular resistances, which is associated with cognitive decline.

Guidelines for management of hypertension in primary prevention set more cautious BP-thresholds as treatment goals in older patients, but guidelines for TIA/stroke make no comment on BP-lowering in older patients and do not address the timing of treatment. Uncertainty about age-specific thresholds and about timing might partly explain underprescription of antihypertensive medications after TIA/stroke, – particularly if decisions are delayed, given that in-hospital prescription is known to be the strongest predictor of long-term adherence. High blood pressure in hypertensive subjects is associated with reduced cerebral blood flow, and with further decline with increasing age in longitudinal cohorts, but there is evidence of an increase in cerebral blood flow after intensive blood pressure lowering in older hypertensive subjects without history of stroke. In the absence of randomised trials comparing different BP-targets in elderly patients with TIA/non-disabling stroke, or of immediate versus delayed initiation of medication, data on the physiological effects of early BP-reduction might provide some support for clinical decision making. We hypothesised that intensive BP-lowering would not decrease transcranial Doppler (TCD) blood flow velocities, and in particular end-diastolic velocity, in older patients with recent TIA/stroke with no intra/extracranial carotid stenosis.

Acute Coronary Syndromes

According to hypertension guidelines, unstable angina and acute myocardial infarction are traditionally listed as criteria to diagnose a hypertensive emergency. Unlike the detailed recommendations for managing high BP in patients with stroke, the hypertension guidelines superficially address BP management in patients with acute cardiac ischemia.

There are no clinical trials of major cardiovascular outcomes assessing the benefits of different strategies to reduce BP in the context of acute coronary syndromes. Differently from guidelines for hypertension, guidelines for acute coronary syndromes focus on revascularization therapies, which are firmly based on the results of randomized clinical trials and do not include BP in the flow charts and algorithms for the management.

Physicians are more often concerned with low BP values in patients presenting with acute coronary syndromes, which can signal incipient cardiogenic shock. High BP is usually secondary to pain (reversal causality), particularly in patients with previous hypertension, and is evidence of preserved cardiac output. These patients are treated with nitrates, drugs that have a BP‐lowering effect as one of their mechanisms to reduce myocardial ischemia, while the procedures to promote coronary reperfusion are prepared.

Secondary stroke prevention — antihypertensive treatment recommendations: In patients with hypertension who have experienced an ischemic stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA), or intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), treatment with a thiazide‑type diuretic, angiotensin‑converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) is recommended for lowering BP and reducing recurrent stroke and ICH risk; in the same population, an office SBP/DBP goal of < 130/80 mm Hg is recommended to reduce the risk of recurrent stroke, ICH, and other vascular events; and in patients with no history of hypertension who have experienced an ischemic stroke, TIA, or ICH and have an average office SBP/DBP of ≥ 130/80 mm Hg, antihypertensive medication treatment can be beneficial to reduce the risk of recurrent stroke, ICH, and other vascular events.

### Pharmacologic treatment of hypertensive urgency in the outpatient setting: a systematic review [^115C5U5W]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

In this systematic review of HU, the optimal choice of antihypertensive agent remains unclear (level 2B). Many agents demonstrated blood pressure-lowering benefit: captopril, labetalol, clonidine, amlodipine, verapamil, nitrendipine, isradipine, nifedipine, nitroglycerin, hydralazine, chlorthalidone, furosemide, diazoxide, nitroprusside, and fenoldopam. Other drugs that lowered blood pressure but are unavailable in the U.S. include lacidipine, ketanserin, and urapidil. Clinical choices in the setting of HU seemed to broaden as we conducted our extensive literature search. Side effects ranged from mild (dizziness, headache, nausea and vomiting, dry mouth, mild tachycardia, and sedation) to severe (hypotension, transient ischemic attack, uremia, and acute pulmonary edema).

Most studies limited data collection to the first few hours after initial presentation, which is not sufficient to assess morbidity and mortality. Studies were too clinically and methodologically diverse for a meta-analysis, and those that met our criteria for this systematic review included few patients. Most studies excluded patients with significant comorbidities, such as chronic kidney impairment; however, HU is a common complication in patients with associated comorbidities. In light of these factors, the generalizability of our findings is limited. Most studies that met our inclusion criteria provided only surrogate endpoint data, i.e. blood pressure lowering, and were short-term, lacking long-term morbidity and/or mortality outcomes, and providing statistical power only for differences in blood pressure lowering.

Our comprehensive systematic review regarding treatment of outpatient HU includes office and ER settings, limiting data to short-term observations of blood pressure (less than 24 h). This review also included studies based on blood pressure cut-offs, allowing us to distinguish studies that were mislabeled as urgencies or emergencies.
