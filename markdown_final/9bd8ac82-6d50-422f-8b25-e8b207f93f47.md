## Question

causes of chronic sinusitis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the causes of chronic sinusitis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the precise definition and diagnostic framework so I'm sure we're truly discussing chronic rhinosinusitis rather than recurrent acute disease. Then, I should verify the contemporary pathophysiology model that moved beyond simple blockage to a mucosal inflammation concept. Next, I will categorize causal contributors into microbial, immunologic, epithelial barrier, genetic/systemic, and environmental domains. After that, I need to examine how geography and endotypes alter the inflammatory pattern and thus the apparent "causes". Finally, I will synthesize a multifactorial model that explains initiation, propagation, and persistence in a clinically useful way [^114xDzAh] [^116Jkr2C].

> Let me first confirm the definition to avoid a false start. Chronic sinusitis is best termed chronic rhinosinusitis, defined by sinonasal mucosal inflammation lasting more than 12 weeks and, diagnostically, should be confirmed with objective evidence of inflammation by endoscopy or CT rather than symptoms alone, so I need to ensure we are not conflating symptoms-only with true CRS. I initially thought CRS prevalence is a simple "about 10%", but wait, let me verify; population estimates often cite 5%–12%, whereas clinically defined CRS with objective findings is lower, around 3%–6.4%, so I should be careful to distinguish survey-based prevalence from objectively confirmed disease [^114xDzAh] [^116Jkr2C] [^112mnSJU].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about "sinus blockage" being the primary cause. The modern framework emphasizes CRS as a heterogeneous inflammatory disease spectrum with a shift from a historical ventilation/drainage paradigm to a mucosal concept driven by complex interactions among host immunity, epithelium, microbes, and environment. I need to remember that "cause" here often means upstream drivers of persistent mucosal inflammation rather than a single pathogen, which explains the variability in response to antibiotics and the emphasis on endotypes over simple phenotypes [^1113YU2n] [^117Co8WT] [^114xDzAh] [^114LHdAn].

> Next, I will examine infectious and microbial contributors, but I should double-check that these are often triggers or perpetuators rather than sole root causes. In chronic disease, cultures frequently detect Staphylococcus aureus and anaerobes such as Prevotella, Porphyromonas, Fusobacterium, and Peptostreptococcus, while acute disease typically involves different organisms, reminding me that microbial profiles shift with chronicity. Viral upper-respiratory infections can initiate or exacerbate inflammation, and fungi participate across a spectrum from noninvasive allergic fungal rhinosinusitis to invasive disease in the immunocompromised, so I need to clarify context when attributing causality. Beyond single pathogens, dysbiosis with reduced richness and community shifts, including alterations in Actinobacteria, and the "great plate count anomaly" indicating many nonculturable taxa, argue for a community ecology model over a single-cause infection model. Superantigenic effects of S. aureus enterotoxins can amplify local IgE and inflammation, but wait, I should note that if this were the dominant mechanism, anti-staphylococcal therapy would work more consistently than it does in practice, which tempers causal claims for bacteria alone [^1125ww88] [^115vgz1K] [^112EpW7T] [^112399jW] [^113CZpXH] [^115B7h8K] [^114f83Pc] [^117Gi8Zo] [^115QzjR6].

> I will now examine immunologic and inflammatory mechanisms because these often explain persistence. CRS endotypes reflect dominant immune pathways: type 1 (IFN-γ mediated), type 2 (IL-4/IL-5/IL-13 with eosinophils and IgE), and type 3 (IL-17/IL-22), alone or in combination, with type 2 inflammation strongly linked to CRS with nasal polyps and comorbid asthma or aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease. Let me verify the linkage with type 2 signatures; Western CRSwNP is predominantly type 2, often severe, and more likely to relapse, aligning with the clinical pattern many of us observe. Superantigens from S. aureus can further drive polyclonal IgE and mast cell activation locally, which helps explain recalcitrant polyp disease in some patients [^114LHdAn] [^113ABMBz] [^112mnSJU] [^116uJjpw].

> But wait, what about the epithelial surface itself as a causal node. Epithelial barrier dysfunction is a key driver rather than a bystander, with disrupted tight junctions and altered claudins, including claudin-3 being explored as a biomarker in CRSwNP, and both Th1 and Th2 cytokines can directly weaken barrier integrity, creating a permissive environment for chronic inflammation. I should confirm that barrier failure can be both a cause and a consequence, forming a vicious cycle that sustains disease even when microbial loads fluctuate [^112D3Tw7] [^114LHdAn] [^115PnFXB].

> Let me consider genetic and systemic disorders that predispose to or directly cause CRS, because missing these would misattribute causation. Primary immunodeficiencies such as IgA deficiency or CVID, disorders of mucociliary clearance like primary ciliary dyskinesia, and cystic fibrosis with viscous secretions and chronic infection can all underlie persistent disease. Hold on, I should verify that systemic inflammatory diseases like granulomatosis with polyangiitis and sarcoidosis can mimic or cause sinonasal inflammation as well; they can, and they require disease-specific management. Allergic diseases and AERD also cluster with CRS, particularly with polyps, indicating shared inflammatory pathways rather than independent comorbidities [^111tBYmb] [^115vXTiX] [^114qf5Lq].

> Next, I should review environmental and occupational contributors, but I need to be cautious to state associations rather than overstate causality. Occupational dust and toxic gas exposures, clearance-related jobs, damp or moldy environments, indoor factors such as pets and carpets, heating or prolonged air-conditioning, and cigarette smoking have all been associated with increased CRS risk. Air pollutants and irritants can impair the mucosa and promote inflammation, plausibly acting as initiators or perpetuators depending on host susceptibility [^117P5REq] [^114qf5Lq] [^115vgz1K].

> Hold on, I should verify how geography and ethnicity shape these mechanisms because "causes" look different across populations. Asian cohorts more often exhibit neutrophilic patterns and less eosinophilic type 2 inflammation compared with Western cohorts, though an eosinophilic shift has been noted over time in some regions, which alters how we interpret triggers and choose therapies. Phenotypically, we separate CRSwNP and CRSsNP, but endotypic classification by activated pathways is more mechanistically meaningful and guides precision interventions, including biologics in type 2–high disease alongside context-appropriate surgery [^114bNsK1] [^113ABMBz] [^1113YU2n] [^111tPTqC].

> Let me synthesize and double-check the multifactorial model so I do not oversimplify. Initiation often involves environmental triggers such as viral infections, aeroallergens, pollutants, or microbial community shifts in genetically or immunologically susceptible hosts. Propagation reflects dysregulated type 1, 2, or 3 immune responses interacting with epithelial barrier dysfunction and, in many patients, superantigenic or dysbiotic microbial influences that intensify and perpetuate inflammation. Persistence arises from a self-reinforcing loop of impaired barrier function, maladaptive immune activation, and ecological microbiome imbalance, often compounded by comorbid systemic or structural factors, which explains why management must target inflammation, barrier health, and selected anatomic issues rather than chasing a single pathogen as "the cause" [^115B7h8K] [^114jDVao] [^112Dt9y7] [^116eg6x6].

Chronic sinusitis is a multifactorial inflammatory disease driven by **persistent sinonasal inflammation** [^114xDzAh] and **microbial dysbiosis** [^114f83Pc]. Key drivers include **type 2** (IL-4, IL-5, IL-13) [^112D3Tw7] and **type 1/3** (IFN-γ, IL-17) inflammation [^114LHdAn], epithelial barrier dysfunction [^112D3Tw7], and altered microbiota, including Staphylococcus aureus colonization and superantigen effects [^115QzjR6]. Structural factors (septal deviation, polyps), immune deficiencies, and environmental exposures (allergens, pollutants, smoking) further contribute to disease persistence [^111tBYmb] [^116hidHG] [^117P5REq]. Management targets **inflammation** [^112Dt9y7], restores barrier function, and addresses microbial and structural contributors [^112RNk2R].

---

## Inflammatory mechanisms

- **Type 2 inflammation**: IL-4, IL-5, IL-13 [^112D3Tw7] drive eosinophilic inflammation, goblet cell hyperplasia [^114DyayZ], mucus hypersecretion, and epithelial barrier dysfunction.

- **Type 1 and type 3 inflammation**: IFN-γ and IL-17/IL-22 [^114LHdAn] mediate neutrophilic inflammation and epithelial barrier disruption [^112D3Tw7].

- **Epithelial barrier dysfunction**: Tight junction disruption [^112D3Tw7] increases permeability, promoting chronic inflammation [^115PnFXB].

---

## Microbial dysbiosis

Within microbial dysbiosis, **altered microbiota** [^114f83Pc] with reduced diversity [^115B7h8K] and increased Staphylococcus aureus colonization are common in CRS. **Superantigens** from S. aureus enterotoxins [^115QzjR6] amplify local inflammation and drive polyclonal IgE production.

---

## Structural abnormalities

Structural abnormalities include **anatomical variations** — such as septal deviation, concha bullosa, and narrow osteomeatal complexes — that impair drainage and ventilation, as well as **nasal polyps**, which are associated with type 2 inflammation [^112mnSJU] and cause obstruction and persistent inflammation.

---

## Immune system dysfunction

Immune system dysfunction includes **immune deficiencies** — both primary and secondary — that increase susceptibility to chronic infections [^111tBYmb], as well as **autoimmune diseases** such as granulomatosis with polyangiitis and sarcoidosis that contribute to chronic inflammation.

---

## Environmental and lifestyle factors

- **Allergens**: Persistent exposure to allergens triggers chronic inflammation.

- **Pollutants and irritants**: Tobacco smoke and occupational exposures [^117P5REq] exacerbate inflammation [^116hidHG].

- **Smoking**: Strongly associated with increased CRS risk and severity.

---

## Comorbid conditions

- **Asthma**: Strongly associated with CRS [^111tBYmb], particularly with nasal polyps [^112mnSJU].

- **Cystic fibrosis**: Impaired mucociliary clearance predisposes to chronic sinusitis [^111tBYmb].

- **Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)**: Refluxed gastric contents irritate sinonasal mucosa, promoting inflammation.

---

Chronic sinusitis arises from a **complex interplay** [^114xDzAh] of inflammatory pathways, microbial dysbiosis, structural abnormalities, immune dysfunction, and environmental exposures. Effective management requires a **comprehensive approach** targeting these underlying factors [^112RNk2R].

### Chronic rhinosinusitis pathogenesis [^111tBYmb]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2015). High credibility.

Chronic rhinosinusitis is associated with various conditions such as HIV infection, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, and IgA deficiency. Symptoms can include headache, nasal congestion, and allergy. Other related conditions include sarcoidosis; granulomatosis with polyangiitis; nasal mucosal erythema; and rhinorrhea, which may lead to a reduced sense of smell. The disease is also linked to aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease, facial pain, sleeping disorder, and postnasal drip. Additionally, it is associated with asthma, halitosis, ear pain, facial pressure, and cough. Further symptoms involve nasal discharge, primary ciliary dyskinesia, nasal obstruction, nasal septum perforation, nasal polyps, cystic fibrosis, and common variable immunodeficiency.

### Occupational and environmental risk factors for chronic rhinosinusitis in China: a multicentre cross-sectional study [^117P5REq]. Respiratory Research (2016). Low credibility.

Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is defined as a condition of inflammation in the paranasal sinus mucosa persisting for more than 12 weeks. We previously reported that the prevalence of CRS was about 8% in China. Here, we aim to investigate the occupational and environmental risk factors associated with CRS.

- **Methods**: Data were collected from seven Chinese cities: Urumqi, Changchun, Beijing, Wuhan, Chengdu, Huaian, and Guangzhou. CRS was diagnosed according to the European Position Paper on Rhinosinusitis and Nasal Polyps (EP(3)OS) document. Participants completed a standardized questionnaire developed by the Global Allergy and Asthma European Network (GA(2)LEN) project, covering sociodemographic characteristics, CRS-related symptoms, and occupational and environmental exposures. We evaluated the association between CRS and various occupational and environmental factors using odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs).

- **Results**: The total study population consisted of 10,633 subjects, 850 (7.99%) of whom were defined as having CRS according to the EP(3)OS criteria. We found significant associations between occupational and environmental factors and CRS. Specifically, having a clearance-related job, occupational exposure to dust, occupational exposure to poisonous gas, having a pet at home, or having carpet at home or at the workplace were risk factors for CRS. Additionally, the method used to keep warm in winter, the duration of time spent using air conditioning in summer, and the frequency of exposure to mouldy or damp environments were significant factors.

### Unraveling the role of the microbiome in chronic rhinosinusitis [^114f83Pc]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). Low credibility.

Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a complex, heterogeneous condition likely associated with infectious and inflammatory causative factors. Renewed interest in the role that microbes play in this condition has stemmed from advancements in microbe identification and parallel research implicating the microbiome as having a role in other chronic inflammatory conditions. This clinical commentary provides a review of the literature relevant to chronic rhinosinusitis, with particular focus on the following areas:

- **Sinonasal microbiome investigation**: Specific factors related to the investigation of the sinonasal microbiome are explored.
- **Dysbiosis and disease state**: Evidence for the role of dysbiosis in the disease state is examined.
- **Influences on the microbiome**: Various influences that may affect the microbiome are considered.

Possible mechanisms of disease and therapeutic implications through microbial manipulation are also reviewed, along with deficiencies and limitations of the body of research.

### The epithelial barrier theory and its associated diseases [^112D3Tw7]. Allergy (2024). Low credibility.

Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is an inflammatory disease of the paranasal sinuses, diagnosed clinically with at least two of four symptoms, such as sinus pressure, rhinorrhea, nasal obstruction, and hyposmia/anosmia persisting for at least 12 weeks. CRS affects nearly 15% of the US population and has been reported to be increasing in prevalence since 1991, placing an immense burden on both patients and the healthcare system.

Although the pathogenesis of CRS is still elusive, there is strong evidence suggesting that epithelial barrier defects and inflammation play a role. Air-liquid interface cultures of epithelia from patients with CRS showed a disrupted epithelial barrier with an altered expression pattern in tight junctions (TJs). Claudin-3 has been identified as a potential biomarker for predicting nasal epithelial barrier defects and disease severity in CRS with nasal polyps (NPs). Evidence showed that the sinonasal epithelial integrity was downregulated by Th1 (IFN-γ) and Th2 (IL-4) cytokines in vitro. Van Bruaene et al. also reported that CRS with NPs patients in Western populations display a Th2 type inflammatory profile, whereas CRS patients without NPs show a Th1 type. In addition, patients with the same phenotype of CRS (e.g. CRS with NPs) may have different endotypes due to different functional or pathophysiologic findings. NPs from patients with eosinophilic CRS (eCRS) showed elevated levels of expression of IL4, IL5, IL13, TSLP, and IL1RL1 (ST2 [an IL-33 receptor]), whereas NPs from patients with non-eCRS showed elevated levels of expression of IL17A.

The following constitutes key background information on chronic rhinosinusitis:

- **Definition**: CRS is defined as the evidence of inflammation in the sinonasal mucosa for more than 12 weeks, characterized by sinus pressure, nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, and a decreased sense of smell.

- **Pathophysiology**: A complex interplay of host factors, including defects in mechanical, innate, and adaptive components of the immune system, and environmental factors such as allergens, toxins, and microbial agents, have been implicated in the development of CRS.

- **Disease course**: Clinical manifestations include persistent sinus pressure, nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, and a decreased sense of smell.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: CRS is not associated with increased mortality.

### The development of the mucosal concept in chronic rhinosinusitis and its clinical implications [^1113YU2n]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2022). Low credibility.

In the last two decades, an increasing understanding of pathophysiological mechanisms in chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) has opened an avenue from phenotyping to endotyping, from eosinophilic inflammation to type 2 immunity, and from the ventilation and drainage paradigm to the mucosal concept for therapeutic considerations. With the advent of type 2 endotyping and targeted biomarkers, precise endotype-driven therapeutic options are possible, including biologics and adapted surgical approaches.

We aim to focus on the complexity and heterogeneity of the features of CRS endotypes, especially for those with nasal polyps, including their history, latest developments, clinical associations, and endotype-driven solutions. To better manage uncontrolled severe CRS in clinical practice, medical decisions based on a profound understanding of the pathology and immunology of this heterogeneous disease, aiding a precision-medicine-based approach for patient treatment, are pivotal.

### Il-13-associated epithelial remodeling correlates with clinical severity in nasal polyposis [^114DyayZ]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2023). Low credibility.

Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a chronic inflammatory condition affecting the nasal mucosa and paranasal sinuses in 10% of the adult population. Although patients suffer from a common array of symptoms, including congestion, nasal discharge, facial pressure, and anosmia, CRS is increasingly recognized as a heterogeneous disease. Two major forms of CRS are recognized: CRS with nasal polyps (CRSwNP; referred to herein as "polyp" for simplicity) and CRS without polyps (CRSsNP). Within these major subtypes, further pathologic or endotypic divisions are incompletely defined. Epithelial remodeling, epithelial barrier dysfunction, shifts in microbial ecology, and immune activation are key processes that are thought to contribute to the pathophysiology, but the specific sequence of these events or their relationship to one another is not known.

Critical to developing or selecting therapies for patients with chronic inflammatory airway diseases such as CRS is characterizing the epithelial changes ("remodeling") that drive clinical pathology and understanding how this remodeling is directed by inflammatory mediators. IL-13 is widely accepted to be a key driver of goblet cell differentiation in type 2 inflammation, but other epithelial changes and inflammatory mediators are less well understood. In addition, existing data on cell-type composition changes that might be driven by inflammation are inconsistent. For instance, basal cells have been reported in some publications to be increased in polyps, but this finding has not been consistent. Moreover, the airway epithelial landscape includes many cell types and functions, each potentially contributing to the disease pathology in unique ways.

### Is there a role for antibiotics in the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis [^114LHdAn]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). Low credibility.

Given that a clear link between bacteria and chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) has not yet been established, an increasing number of researchers have shifted the focus of their research to immunological factors underlying CRS. Some have postulated that CRS is a purely immune-mediated disease in which the observed microbial changes are either secondary or limited to causing exacerbations. Increasingly sophisticated analysis of the inflammatory pathways altered in CRS has revealed many new potential targets for pharmacological intervention, encouraging further research in this field.

- **Inflammatory mechanisms**: CRS has been historically classified by simple clinical phenotyping into CRS with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) and CRS without nasal polyps (CRSsNP). In the contemporary model of CRS pathogenesis, the research focus has moved toward the identification of the molecular pathways (or endotypes) that have been activated. In cases of CRS, mucosal barrier disruption may initiate a chronic inflammatory response that fails to resolve. The inflammatory changes may utilize types 1, 2, or 3 inflammatory pathways, either alone or in combination.

	- **Type 1 responses** are directed against intracellular pathogens, most commonly viruses, and are characterized by cytokine interferon-γ.
	- **Type 2 responses** are directed against large, extracellular parasites and are characterized by cytokines IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 as well as activation and recruitment of eosinophils and mast cells.
	- **Type 3 responses** are directed against extracellular bacteria and fungi and are characterized by cytokines IL-17 and IL-22. Each type of response is mediated by an innate lymphocyte.

### Sinus microbiota varies among chronic rhinosinusitis phenotypes and predicts surgical outcome [^113CZpXH]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2015). Low credibility.

Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a prevalent multifactorial disease process in which bacteria are believed to play a role in the propagation of inflammation. Multiple subtypes of CRS have been described based on clinical and pathologic features, but a detailed examination of the sinus microbiota in patients with CRS and its clinical subtypes has yet to be performed.

- **Objective**: We sought to examine the resident microbiota of CRS subtypes and determine whether bacterial diversity is a predictor of disease outcomes.

- **Methods**: Sinus swabs from patients with CRS and healthy subjects collected during endoscopic sinus surgery were analyzed by means of molecular phylogenetic analysis of 16S rDNA pyrosequences.

- **Results**: Fifty-six patients with CRS and 26 control subjects were studied. Biodiversity was similar between the CRS and control groups. Among the CRS subtypes examined, only two conditions (presence of purulence and comorbid condition of asthma) were associated with significant alterations in microbial community composition. In 27 patients with CRS who were followed postoperatively, those with better outcomes had more diverse bacterial communities present at the time of surgery, along with higher relative abundances of Actinobacteria.

- **Conclusion**: Analysis of microbiota in a large cohort reveals that particular CRS phenotypes (asthma and purulence) are characterized by distinct compositions of resident bacterial communities. We found that bacterial diversity and composition are predictors of surgical outcome, promoting the concept of community ecology in patients.

### Chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyps [^114qf5Lq]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2016). Low credibility.

Chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyps (CRSsNP) is more prevalent than chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP). Certain diseases predispose individuals to CRSsNP, whereas others are associated with it. Predisposing diseases include allergic and nonallergic upper and lower airway diseases, epithelial cell disorders, immunodeficiencies, autoimmune diseases, and some infectious diseases.

In addition, environmental and host factors, such as smoking, a higher incidence of abnormal biofilms, and innate immune defects, play a role in the pathogenesis of this disease. CRSsNP is characterized by histologic abnormalities, including basement membrane thickening (fibrosis) and goblet cell hyperplasia. Neutrophils and several chemokines, such as TGF-β and C-X-C motif chemokine ligand (CXCL)-8, play a role in CRSsNP remodeling.

However, there are conflicting data about CRSsNP endotypes; for example, whether it is characterized by neutrophilia, eosinophilia, or both. Despite advancements in understanding the pathogenesis of this disease, additional study is necessary to better comprehend its underlying mechanisms, endotypes, and evidence-based treatment strategies.

### Genetics and phenotyping in chronic sinusitis [^115VUsYX]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2011). Low credibility.

Chronic sinusitis with nasal polyposis has historically been treated as a single monolithic clinical disorder. Just as asthma is now accepted as comprising numerous heterogeneous diseases, chronic sinusitis should also be viewed as comprising several diseases with varying causes. Each one is characterized by distinct histologic, gene, and protein expression patterns. This includes recognizing the need to define these diseases based on the presence or absence of an eosinophilic infiltrate, as well as additional distinctions based on the unique agents that drive their development and perpetuation.

As a collection of heterogeneous diseases, proper differential diagnosis is required to delineate appropriate therapeutic intervention. This review will focus on recognized distinct presentations of chronic sinus disease, including distinguishing the clinical presentations, cellular and molecular characteristics, genetic differences, and treatment options for each.

### Clinical practice guideline: Surgical management of chronic rhinosinusitis [^111dyGcY]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Regarding perioperative care for chronic rhinosinusitis, specifically with respect to preoperative counseling, the AAO-HNSF 2025 guidelines recommend educating adult patients with CRS scheduled for sinus surgery about anticipated postoperative care. This includes addressing pain control, debridement, medical management, activity restrictions, return to work, duration and frequency of follow-up visits, and the potential for the disease to recur or require revision surgery.

### Acute rhinosinusitis in adults [^111RohWg]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Rhinosinusitis is one of the most common conditions for which patients seek medical care. Subtypes of rhinosinusitis include acute, subacute, recurrent acute, and chronic. Acute rhinosinusitis is further specified as bacterial or viral. Most cases of acute rhinosinusitis are caused by viral infections associated with the common cold.

Symptomatic treatment with analgesics, decongestants, and saline nasal irrigation is appropriate in patients who present with nonsevere symptoms (e.g. mild pain, temperature less than 101°F [38.3°C]). Narrow-spectrum antibiotics, such as amoxicillin or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, are recommended in patients with symptoms or signs of acute rhinosinusitis that do not improve after seven days or that worsen at any time. Limited evidence supports the use of intranasal corticosteroids in patients with acute rhinosinusitis.

Radiographic imaging is not recommended in the evaluation of uncomplicated acute rhinosinusitis. Computed tomography of the sinuses should not be used for routine evaluation, although it may be used to define anatomic abnormalities and evaluate patients with suspected complications of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis. Rare complications of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis include orbital, intracranial, and bony involvement. If symptoms persist or progress after maximal medical therapy, and if computed tomography shows evidence of sinus disease, referral to an otolaryngologist is warranted.

### Executive summary of the clinical practice guideline on the surgical management of chronic rhinosinusitis [^111YLCGw]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

The purpose of this specialty-specific clinical practice guideline is to identify quality improvement opportunities and provide clinicians with trustworthy, evidence-based recommendations for the surgical management of chronic rhinosinusitis in adults. The target audience includes otolaryngologist-head and neck surgeons who manage adults with chronic rhinosinusitis, including candidacy and performance of endoscopic sinus surgery.

This executive summary describes the guideline developed using the 55-page protocol published as the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation's Clinical Practice Guideline Development Manual (3rd edition), which summarizes the methodology for assessments of data, topic prioritization, development of key action statements (KASs), application of value judgments, and related procedures. The guideline group represented otolaryngologists, rhinologists, advanced practice nursing and physician assistants, and consumers who represented participating national professional organizations.

- **Action statements**: The Guideline Development Group made strong recommendations for the following KASs. Before considering surgery, the surgeon should verify an existing diagnosis of chronic rhinosinusitis to ensure established diagnostic criteria (signs and symptoms) from clinical practice guidelines are met, and the surgeon should assess candidacy for sinus surgery based on symptoms, disease characteristics, quality of life, and prior medical or surgical therapy (KASs 1A and 1B).

### A decade of clinical advances in chronic rhinosinusitis: 2012–2022 [^1169XooM]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2023). Low credibility.

The field of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is constantly evolving. In the past 10 years, key advancements in basic and translational research, as well as clinical studies, have improved our understanding and management of CRS. Notably, treatment options have expanded to include novel therapeutic drugs, devices, and surgical techniques. Assessments of patient symptoms and their impact on quality of life have become more standardized.

Progress has also been made in determining the true prevalence of CRS and recognizing comorbidities that can impact CRS severity. Practice guidelines have shifted from expert opinion to more data-driven analyses. This review highlights major clinical advancements made in the field of CRS over the past 10 years and identifies gaps in knowledge that can form the basis for new areas of study over the next decade.

### Chronic rhinosinusitis in Asia [^114bNsK1]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2017). Low credibility.

Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS), although possibly overdiagnosed, is associated with a high burden of disease and is often difficult to treat in those truly affected. Recent research has demonstrated that inflammatory signatures of CRS vary around the world, with less eosinophilic and more neutrophilic inflammation found in Asia compared with Europe and North America. While in the Western world about 80% of nasal polyps carry a type 2 signature, this might be between 20% and 60% in China and Korea or Thailand, respectively. These differences are associated with a lower asthma comorbidity and risk of disease recurrence after surgery in the Asian population.

As a hallmark of severe type 2 inflammation, eosinophils attacking Staphylococcus aureus at the epithelial barrier have been described recently; they also can be found in a subgroup of Asian patients with nasal polyps. Furthermore, the percentage of type 2 signature disease in patients with CRS is dramatically increasing ("eosinophilic shift") in several Asian countries over the last 20 years. Establishing an accurate diagnosis along with considering the shifting patterns of inflammation seen in Asia will enable more effective selection of appropriate pharmacotherapy, surgical therapy, and eventually biotherapy. Determining the causes and pathophysiology for this eosinophilic shift will require additional research.

### Evolution in the surgical management of chronic rhinosinusitis: Current indications and pitfalls [^1164dpQt]. Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2018). Low credibility.

Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) consists of a range of inflammatory conditions in the sinuses that can result in clinical symptoms. The underlying pathophysiology and its relationship to lower airway disease are complex. Definitions of CRS can serve more as an indication for potential surgical intervention rather than a marker of disease state. CRS can be asymptomatic and may require medical management to avoid disease progression and minimize the risk of lower airway disease.

Endoscopic surgery has undergone a significant evolution and refinement, but the most common surgical complication remains persistent inflammation and disease recurrence. It is important to recognize that surgery alone rarely cures CRS, and patients require long-term medical therapy for continued asymptomatic inflammation. Careful postoperative care and endoscopic follow-up to ensure resolution of inflammation are key to ensuring optimal surgical outcomes and reducing the risk of revision surgery.

Future work on CRS endotypes will allow discovery of new therapies to treat CRS, as well as refine indications for medical or surgical intervention and postoperative care.

### Systemic corticosteroid therapy for acute sinusitis [^115NKemo]. JAMA (2015). Low credibility.

Are oral or parenteral corticosteroids associated with improved clinical outcomes in patients with acute sinusitis compared with placebo or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)?

- **Bottom line**: Oral corticosteroids combined with antibiotics may be associated with modest benefit for short-term relief of symptoms in adults with severe symptoms of acute sinusitis compared with antibiotics alone. Oral corticosteroids as monotherapy are not associated with improved clinical outcomes in adults with clinically diagnosed acute sinusitis.

### Is there a role for antibiotics in the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis [^115QzjR6]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). Low credibility.

Another mechanism whereby bacteria could cause mucosal inflammation without causing an infection is by releasing super-antigens. The best evidence for this process occurring in chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) has been found in the mucosa of patients colonized with Staphylococcus aureus, particularly in cases of CRS with nasal polyps (CRSwNP). However, if super-antigens were a key component of the pathogenesis of CRS, it may reasonably be anticipated that CRS would respond more consistently to anti-Staphylococcal agents than it does in clinical practice.

The clinical relevance of a single, cultured bacterial species within the context of the polymicrobial communities of the sinonasal mucosa, many members of which are recalcitrant to standard culture efforts, remains unclear, and such an approach may poorly represent the in vivo processes involved in the pathogenesis of CRS. Standard culture techniques provide a limited range of conditions for microbial growth and thus may fail to detect taxa that require specific conditions. The disparity between the identification of microbes by culture and those (viable but nonculturable) identified by molecular methods has been termed "the great plate count anomaly", with estimates of the nonculturable portion of microbial communities ranging between 25% and 99%.

Modern culture-independent (molecular) techniques have vastly improved our understanding of the microbiology of CRS. Recent studies have better captured the complexity of the microbial communities associated with CRS, rather than focusing on the effects of a single isolated (and culturable) organism.

### Adult rhinosinusitis: diagnosis and management [^115GykGw]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

Rhinosinusitis can be divided into four subtypes: acute, recurrent acute, subacute, and chronic, based on patient history and a limited physical examination. In most instances, therapy is initiated based on this classification. Antibiotic therapy, supplemented by hydration and decongestants, is indicated for seven to fourteen days in patients with acute, recurrent acute, or subacute bacterial rhinosinusitis. For patients with chronic disease, the same treatment regimen is indicated for an additional four weeks or more, and a nasal steroid may also be prescribed if inhalant allergies are known or suspected.

Nasal endoscopy and computed tomography of the sinuses are reserved for circumstances that include a failure to respond to therapy as expected, spread of infection outside the sinuses, diagnostic uncertainties, and when surgery is being considered. Laboratory tests are infrequently necessary and are reserved for patients with suspected allergies, cystic fibrosis, immune deficiencies, mucociliary disorders, and similar disease states. Findings on endoscopically guided microswab culture obtained from the middle meatus correlate 80 to 85 percent of the time with results from the more painful antral puncture technique and are performed in patients who fail to respond to the initial antibiotic selection.

Surgery is indicated for extranasal spread of infection, evidence of mucocele or pyocele, fungal sinusitis, or obstructive nasal polyposis, and is often performed in patients with recurrent or persistent infection not resolved by drug therapy.

### Imaging of intracranial and orbital complications of sinusitis and atypical sinus infection: What the radiologist needs to know [^111qrsbZ]. Current Problems in Diagnostic Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Sinusitis is a common disease. Complications, however, are less common and can be life-threatening. Major complications occur from the extension of the disease into the orbit and intracranial compartment and often require emergent treatment with intravenous (IV) antibiotics or operative intervention. Immunocompromised patients with acute sinusitis are susceptible to atypical infections, such as invasive fungal sinusitis, which is a surgical emergency. Therefore, it is important to accurately and promptly identify potential complications of acute sinusitis to ensure appropriate treatment and minimize negative outcomes. This article reviews the imaging features of a spectrum of complications associated with acute sinusitis and atypical infections.

This review summarizes the recent literature on the microbiology, diagnosis, and medical and surgical management of acute and chronic frontal sinus disease. Two retrospective studies investigated the microbiology of frontal sinusitis in patients who underwent sinus surgery. In cases of acute frontal sinusitis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Staphylococcus aureus were the predominant pathogens. In contrast, Staphylococcus aureus and anaerobic bacteria were commonly isolated in chronic sinusitis. Surgery is indicated for treating acute and chronic sinusitis and their complications. Several surgical procedures were recently evaluated and are briefly reviewed in this literature.

### EUFOREA consensus on biologics for CRSwNP with or without asthma [^112mnSJU]. Allergy (2019). Low credibility.

Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a chronic inflammatory condition of the sinonasal cavities that affects 5%-12% of the general population worldwide according to epidemiological studies. The European Position Paper on Rhinosinusitis and Nasal Polyps (EPOS) defines CRS clinically based on symptoms supported by signs of mucosal inflammation found on imaging or with nasal endoscopy. Recently, the prevalence of clinically based CRS has shown to be between 3% and 6.4%. CRS is classically divided into phenotypes with and without nasal polyps: CRSwNP and CRSsNP, respectively.

- **Prevalence of CRSwNP**: Using patient questionnaires to measure the prevalence of CRSwNP yielded estimates of 2.1% in France to 4.3% in Finland, and 1.1% in China. CRSwNP comprises a heterogeneous group of patients who differ with respect to coexisting asthma, allergy, NSAID-exacerbated respiratory disease (N-ERD), smoking, age of onset, and disease severity.

- **Coexistence with asthma**: Asthma affects 30%-70% of CRSwNP patients. Conversely, the presence of nasal polyps is associated with the severity of asthma, regardless of smoking status, ranging from 10%-30% in mild asthma to 70%-90% in severe asthma. Both CRSwNP and asthma share common underlying pathophysiological mechanisms driving the disease, known as the endotype, with type 2 inflammation being the most prominent.

- **Characteristics of type 2 inflammation**: It is characterized by the presence of eosinophilic airway inflammation associated with type 2-related cytokines (IL4, IL5, and/or IL13) and circulating and/or local IgE.

### Microbiology of sinusitis [^1125ww88]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2011). Low credibility.

Most sinus infections are viral, and only a small proportion develop a secondary bacterial infection. Rhinoviruses, influenza viruses, and parainfluenza viruses are the most common causes of sinusitis.

- **Common bacteria in acute purulent sinusitis**: The most frequently isolated bacteria from pediatric and adult patients with community-acquired acute purulent sinusitis include Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Streptococcus pyogenes.

- **Chronic sinusitis isolates**: Staphylococcus aureus and anaerobic bacteria such as Prevotella and Porphyromonas, Fusobacterium, and Peptostreptococcus species are the main isolates in chronic sinusitis.

- **Nosocomial and immunocompromised infections**: Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other aerobic and facultative gram-negative rods are commonly isolated from patients with nosocomial sinusitis, the immunocompromised host, those with HIV infection, and in cystic fibrosis.

- **Neutropenic patient isolates**: Fungi and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are the most common isolates in neutropenic patients.

The microbiology of sinusitis is influenced by previous antimicrobial therapy, vaccinations, and the presence of normal flora capable of interfering with the growth of pathogens.

### Emergency radiologic approach to sinus disease [^115vfwnG]. Emergency Radiology (2021). Low credibility.

Sinus disease is commonly encountered, especially in the acute care setting. Imaging can support a diagnosis of sinusitis, help identify an etiology, and delineate intracranial and extracranial complications. Suspicion of complicated rhinosinusitis is an indication for contrast-enhanced computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. It is important for radiologists to be familiar with patient risk factors that predispose them to uncommon but aggressive forms of sinus disease, such as invasive fungal sinusitis. Lastly, many conditions, ranging from benign to malignant, can mimic rhinosinusitis clinically and on imaging. Radiologists can help by recognizing these entities and facilitating appropriate referral and follow-up. This article reviews the breadth of sinus disease commonly encountered in the emergency setting, potential complications, and mimics.

### The association between disease severity and microbiome in chronic rhinosinusitis [^115B7h8K]. The Laryngoscope (2019). Low credibility.

The role of the microbiome in the etiology of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is still debated. Reductions in richness and diversity have been implicated in CRS. However, limited knowledge exists regarding the impact of disease severity on the microbiome. The associations between constituents of the microbiome and the degree of mucosal inflammation and tissue eosinophilia are described.

- **Methods**: A cross-sectional study of CRS and non-CRS patients who underwent endoscopic sinus surgery was performed. Sinus mucosal biopsies were assessed for the degree of inflammation and tissue eosinophilia. Middle-meatal swabs were subjected to 16S rRNA gene sequencing, which quantified the prevalence, mean relative abundance, richness, and diversity. Comparisons between the microbiome at the genus level and degree of inflammation (absent, mild, moderate, severe) and tissue eosinophilia (absent, 100 per high-powered field) were performed.

- **Results**: Eighty-nine patients (52.8 ± 14.21 years, 64.0% male) were assessed. Of those, 52 had CRS, and 37 were controls. Corynebacterium and Staphylococcus were the most abundant genera in both the CRS (29% and 16%) and non-CRS groups (40% and 20%). Richness decreased in more severely inflamed patients (23.2 ± 13.9 vs. 18.1 ± 16.1 vs. 16.8 ± 12.3 vs. 14.7 ± 10.9; P < 0.01), as did diversity (1.4 ± 0.7 vs. 1.2 ± 1.0 vs. 1.2 ± 0.8 vs. 0.9 ± 0.7; P = 0.05). Richness was associated with higher tissue eosinophilia (23.2 ± 13.9 vs. 19.3 ± 17.2 vs. 15.9 ± 11.6 vs. 13.4 ± 6.6; P < 0.01).

### Surgical management of rhinosinusitis for the allergist-immunologist [^112RNk2R]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2023). High credibility.

Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a common chronic inflammatory disease characterized by inflammation of the sinus, with or without nasal passage inflammation, occurring for more than 12 weeks at a time. CRS has historically been classified into two categories: CRS without nasal polyps or CRS with nasal polyps (25%-30% of cases). The mainstay of treatment for CRS, with or without nasal polyps, is medical management. Options may include a combination of saline irrigation, nasal steroids, allergy medications, antibiotics, oral steroids, and treatment with targeted monoclonal antibodies. Unfortunately, up to 60% of patients report symptoms refractory to maximal medical therapy; therefore, a combined approach of surgery and medical therapy may be offered.

Endoscopic sinus surgery for CRS is approached in a stepwise fashion, ranging from the simplest technique, such as polyp removal, to more expanded approaches that open the paranasal sinuses and allow gravity-dependent drainage. This review article provides an in-depth explanation of various surgical approaches for CRS, including the indications, techniques, and respective outcomes for each one.

### The role of biologics in chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps [^111tPTqC]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2021). Low credibility.

Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) is a common and heterogeneous inflammatory disease of the upper respiratory tract. This article provides expert opinion and points of view from both allergists and rhinologists who specialize in CRSwNP. Despite the potential value of biomarker-based endotyping to provide guidance regarding optimal care and treatment choices for patients with CRSwNP, practice is largely not biomarker-based. In general, there is agreement that for patients with symptomatic CRSwNP who have failed a trial of a course of at least three months of intranasal steroids and a short course of oral corticosteroids, a surgical intervention will often be the next treatment of choice.

Biologics may be considered before an initial surgery in patients with comorbid severe asthma and in those for whom surgery is less available, refused by the patient, or likely to be associated with a higher-than-average complication rate. The use of biologics immediately following surgery may be considered in patients who have a history of nasal polyp recurrence within 12 months of a prior surgery. For many patients with recalcitrant disease, a combination of sinus surgery and the use of a biologic targeted to their precise endotype may be the optimal treatment strategy, though debates remain ongoing regarding which surgical approach and which biologics are best for each patient.

### Is there a role for antibiotics in the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis [^116GSbUg]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). Low credibility.

Rhinosinusitis is one of the most common reasons for adult outpatient antibiotic prescriptions, though there is little clinical evidence to support this practice, especially for chronic rhinosinusitis. Despite considerable research, the etiology of chronic rhinosinusitis, including the pathogenic role of microbes, remains poorly understood. Rigorous studies of the efficacy of antibiotic treatment of chronic sinusitis are surprisingly few in number, and the results are somewhat conflicting. This article will review the rationales for and against the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis with antibiotics, based on evidence and understanding of pathophysiology, and will also summarize the guidelines.

### Clinical practice guideline (update): Adult sinusitis [^114RCeCn]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2015). High credibility.

This update of a 2007 guideline from the American Academy of Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery Foundation provides evidence-based recommendations to manage adult rhinosinusitis, defined as symptomatic inflammation of the paranasal sinuses and nasal cavity. Changes from the prior guideline include adding a consumer to the update group, integrating evidence from 42 new systematic reviews, and offering enhanced information on patient education and counseling. A new algorithm clarifies action statement relationships, expands opportunities for watchful waiting (without antibiotic therapy) as initial therapy for acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS), and presents three new recommendations for managing chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS).

The purpose of this multidisciplinary guideline is to identify quality improvement opportunities in managing adult rhinosinusitis and to create explicit and actionable recommendations for implementing these opportunities in clinical practice. Specifically, the goals are to improve diagnostic accuracy for adult rhinosinusitis, promote appropriate use of ancillary tests to confirm diagnosis and guide management, and promote judicious use of systemic and topical therapy. This includes radiography, nasal endoscopy, computed tomography, and testing for allergy and immune function. Emphasis was also placed on identifying multiple chronic conditions that would modify the management of rhinosinusitis, including asthma, cystic fibrosis, compromised immune state, and ciliary dyskinesia.

The update group made strong recommendations that clinicians should distin

### Association between allergic rhinitis, nasal polyps, chronic sinusitis and chronic respiratory diseases: a Mendelian randomization study [^116uJjpw]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

Nasal polyps (NP), originating from the middle meatus, are inflammatory growths of paranasal sinus mucosa. They are mostly benign, commonly bilateral, typically manifesting in adulthood, and are characterized by inflammation. The pathogenesis of nasal polyps involves chronic inflammation of the sinonasal mucosa, predominantly driven by type 2 inflammation, which leads to IgE antibody production and the recruitment and activation of eosinophils. The presence of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps is often associated with changes in the nasal mucosa's microbial environment, particularly a higher prevalence of Staphylococcus aureus colonization. This colonization triggers immune cell infiltration, which can result in tissue damage and compromise the mucosal barrier. Additionally, Staphylococcus aureus enterotoxins function as superantigens, promoting the local generation of polyclonal IgE. This process intensifies mast cell activation, exacerbating inflammation and contributing to the persistence of the chronic inflammation.

Dysfunction of the mucosal barrier in the nasal passages and sinuses may compromise the airway's ability to defend against pathogens and irritants. This impairment may lead to increased susceptibility to respiratory infections and subsequent development of chronic respiratory conditions. Alterations in the nasal and upper airway microbiome associated with nasal polyps could influence the composition and function of the lower airway microbiome. Meanwhile, nasal polyps can physically obstruct the nasal passages, leading to impaired nasal airflow.

### Fungal rhinosinusitis: A categorization and definitional schema addressing current controversies [^112EpW7T]. The Laryngoscope (2009). Low credibility.

Fungal (rhino-) sinusitis encompasses a wide spectrum of immune and pathological responses, including invasive, chronic, granulomatous, and allergic disease. However, consensus on terminology, pathogenesis, and optimal management is lacking. The International Society for Human and Animal Mycology convened a working group to attempt consensus on terminology and disease classification.

- **Discussion**: Key conclusions reached were: rhinosinusitis is preferred to sinusitis; acute invasive fungal rhinosinusitis is preferred to fulminant or necrotizing, and should refer to disease of less than 4 weeks duration in immunocompromised patients. Both chronic invasive rhinosinusitis and granulomatous rhinosinusitis were useful terms encompassing locally invasive disease over at least 3 months duration, with differing pathology and clinical settings. Fungal ball of the sinus is preferred to either mycetoma or aspergilloma of the sinuses; localized fungal colonization of nasal or paranasal mucosa should be introduced to refer to localized infection visualized endoscopically. Eosinophilic mucin is preferred to allergic mucin, and allergic fungal rhinosinusitis (AFRS), eosinophilic fungal rhinosinusitis, and eosinophilic mucin rhinosinusitis (EMRS) are imprecise and require better definition. In particular, to implicate fungi (as in AFRS and EMRS), hyphae must be visualized in eosinophilic mucin, but this is often not processed or examined carefully enough by histologists, reducing the universality of the disease classification. A schema for subclassifying these entities, including aspirin.

### Evaluation of the medical and surgical treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis: A prospective, randomised, controlled trial [^111joiBN]. The Laryngoscope (2004). Low credibility.

To conduct the first prospective, randomized, controlled trial evaluating and comparing the medical and surgical treatment of polypoid and nonpolypoid chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS), ninety patients with CRS were equally randomized either to medical or surgical therapy. All patients underwent pre- and post-treatment assessments of visual analogue score (VAS), the Sinonasal Outcome Test-20 (SNOT-20), the Short Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36), nitric oxide (NO), acoustic rhinometry, saccharine clearance time (SCT), and nasal endoscopy. Each patient had three assessments: before starting the treatment, after 6 months, and finally, after 1 year.

Both the medical and surgical treatment of CRS significantly improved almost all the subjective and objective parameters of CRS (P < .05), except for the total nasal volume in CRS (P < .01) and CRS without polyposis (P < .01) groups, in which the surgical treatment demonstrated greater changes.

CRS should be initially targeted with maximal medical therapy (e.g. a 3-month course of a macrolide antibiotic, douche, and topical steroid), with surgical treatment being reserved for cases refractory to medical therapy. The presence of nasal polyps is not a poor prognostic factor for the efficacy of CRS therapy, either surgical or medical.

### Impact of biologics on surgery in chronic rhinosinusitis with polyps and allergic fungal sinusitis [^112KehF2]. The Laryngoscope (2025). Low credibility.

Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) represents a significant clinical and economic burden worldwide. The acknowledged heterogeneity of CRS has given rise to the concept of biological subtypes or "endotypes", each defined by distinct pathophysiology, corresponding biomarkers, and differences in response to treatments. Predominant subtypes of CRS include chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP), estimated to affect 1%–4% of the adult population worldwide, and allergic fungal rhinosinusitis (AFRS), estimated to account for 5%–10% of CRS cases in tropical areas where the disease is more prevalent.

The etiology of CRSwNP and AFRS involves a complex interplay between genetic, environmental, and immunological factors, with Th2 helper T-cell (Th2) pathways playing a critical role in driving eosinophilic inflammation and polyp formation through the production of cytokines including interleukins IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13. Although CRSwNP and AFRS both present with nasal polyposis, they are differentiated by variations in underlying pathophysiology. In Western populations, CRSwNP is often characterized by a predominant eosinophilic inflammation mediated by Th2 cytokines, whereas AFRS is unique in its association with fungal antigens and a mixed inflammatory response, highlighting the diversity and complexity of CRS etiologies.

### Pathogenesis of chronic rhinosinusitis: Inflammation [^117Co8WT]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2011). Low credibility.

Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a heterogeneous group of inflammatory diseases of the nasal and paranasal cavities, either accompanied by polyp formation (CRSwNP) or without polyps (CRSsNP). CRSsNP and CRSwNP are prevalent medical conditions associated with a substantially impaired quality of life, reduced workplace productivity, and serious medical treatment costs. Despite recent research evidence contributing to further unveiling the pathophysiology of these chronic airway conditions, the cause remains poorly understood and appears to be multifactorial.

A diverse spectrum of alterations involves histopathology, inflammatory cell and T-cell patterns, remodeling parameters (e.g. TGF-β), eicosanoid and IgE production, microorganisms, and epithelial barrier malfunctions. These factors are reported in the search to describe the pathogenesis of this heterogeneous group of upper airway diseases. Furthermore, novel evidence indicates considerable heterogeneity within the CRSwNP subgroup, determining the risk of comorbid asthma.

The characterization of specific disease subgroups is a challenging scientific and clinical task of utmost importance in the development of diagnostic tools and the application of individualized treatments. This review focuses on recent evidence that sheds new light on our knowledge regarding the inflammatory process of CRS to further unravel its pathogenesis.

### A comprehensive review of the nasal microbiome in chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) [^114jDVao]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2016). Low credibility.

Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) has been recognized as a disease with significant infectious and inflammatory components for decades. The recent advancement in methods identifying microbes has aided in implicating the airway microbiome in inflammatory respiratory diseases such as asthma and COPD. Such studies support the role of resident microbes in both the health and disease of host tissue, particularly in relation to inflammatory mucosal diseases. Identifying interactive events between microbes and elements of the immune system is crucial in uncovering the pathogenic mechanisms underlying CRS. This review provides an analysis of the findings regarding the complex upper respiratory microbiome in CRS compared to healthy controls. Moreover, we have reviewed the defects and alterations of the host immune system that interact with microbes and could be associated with dysbiosis in CRS.

### Clinical assessment of chronic rhinosinusitis [^116nY1bj]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2022). Low credibility.

Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a common disease that affects more than 10% of the adult population in Europe and the United States. It has been delineated phenotypically into CRS without nasal polyps and CRS with nasal polyps. Both have a high disease burden and an overlapping spectrum of symptoms, such as nasal obstruction, olfactory dysfunction, facial pain, pressure, and nasal discharge.

Primary assessment includes evaluation of patient symptoms and their impact on quality of life, nasal endoscopic examination, and imaging. Significant progress has been made in understanding the pathophysiology of CRS. There is a shift toward describing CRS in terms of the predominant endotype or inflammatory pattern pathomechanism, rather than the traditional classification of patients with and without nasal polyps.

An increased elucidation of the disease endotypes, characterized by their inflammatory pathways and mediators, is leading to a more tailored, personalized treatment approach to the different disease subtypes.

### Minimal radiographic mucosal thickness or opacification criterion for sinus-specific endoscopic sinus surgery for chronic rhinosinusitis [^112CVbpF]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2023). Low credibility.

Primary chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is typically a diffuse process, and the extent of endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) performed for medically recalcitrant CRS is influenced by numerous factors. However, some third-party payors have implemented policies to authorize coverage for ESS on a sinus-by-sinus basis. This authorization is based on a minimal measurement of millimeters of mucosal thickening or sinus opacification in the corresponding sinus being surgically addressed. Our objective was to determine whether such policies are scientifically supported. Specifically, we aimed to assess whether, in patients with medically recalcitrant CRS, a minimum measurement of mucosal thickening or sinus opacification predicts CRS in that sinus or improved outcomes post-ESS on a sinus-by-sinus basis.

The data sources used included the Medline, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science databases, covering publications from inception through May 2022.

A systematic review was performed following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. From 6070 abstracts screened, 112 studies underwent a full-text review. These studies did not investigate or provide evidence that any minimal degree of radiographic mucosal thickening or sinus opacification predicts CRS or results in better outcomes post-ESS in a sinus-specific manner.

In conclusion, we found no evidence to support the use of a minimum measurement of mucosal thickening or sinus opacification as predictors of CRS or improved post-ESS outcomes in a sinus-specific manner.

### Clinical practice guideline: Adult sinusitis [^115vXTiX]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

This guideline provides evidence-based recommendations on managing sinusitis, defined as symptomatic inflammation of the paranasal sinuses. Sinusitis affects 1 in 7 adults in the United States, resulting in about 31 million individuals diagnosed each year. Since sinusitis almost always involves the nasal cavity, the term rhinosinusitis is preferred. The guideline targets patients aged 18 years or older with uncomplicated rhinosinusitis, evaluated in any setting in which an adult with rhinosinusitis would be identified, monitored, or managed. This guideline is intended for all clinicians who are likely to diagnose and manage adults with sinusitis.

- **Purpose**: The primary purpose of this guideline is to improve diagnostic accuracy for adult rhinosinusitis, reduce inappropriate antibiotic use, reduce inappropriate use of radiographic imaging, and promote appropriate use of ancillary tests that include nasal endoscopy, computed tomography, and testing for allergy and immune function. In creating this guideline, the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation selected a panel representing the fields of allergy, emergency medicine, family medicine, health insurance, immunology, infectious disease, internal medicine, medical informatics, nursing, otolaryngology-head and neck surgery, pulmonology, and radiology.

- **Results**: The panel made strong recommendations that clinicians should distinguish presumed acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) from acute rhinosinusitis caused by viral upper respiratory infections and noninfectious conditions.

### What's that smell? A pictorial review of the olfactory pathways and imaging assessment of the myriad pathologies that can affect them [^112399jW]. Insights into Imaging (2021). Low credibility.

Chronic rhinosinusitis is common, and the severity of chronic sinusitis is correlated with reduced olfactory bulb volumes. Sinonasal polyposis often coexists with chronic rhinosinusitis. The role of CT is to assess the pattern of sinonasal drainage impairment to guide potential endoscopic approach. Prompt diagnosis allows for early treatment, which can increase olfactory bulb volumes and improve the patient's sense of smell. Mucosal thickening and sinus opacification can occur in both acute and chronic sinusitis. The presence of an air-fluid level distinguishes the acute form from the chronic form.

Fungal sinusitis can be either non-invasive (subcategorized as allergic or fungal ball/mycetoma forming) or invasive (subcategorized as acute invasive, chronic invasive, or the very infrequently occurring chronic granulomatous). Allergic non-invasive fungal sinusitis is most common. Although olfactory dysfunction is not considered part of the diagnostic criteria, patients can experience significant olfactory disturbance. It is characterized by the presence of hyperdense serpiginous fungal elements (which can even be calcified) completely opacifying and expanding/remodeling the sinus.

### Chinese position paper on biologic therapy for chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps [^114XdExd]. Allergy (2025). Low credibility.

Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a chronic inflammation of the nasal mucosa and sinuses, with a prevalence of approximately 5%–12% globally and 8% in China. CRS can be classified into CRS without nasal polyps and CRS with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) based on the presence of polyps. Compared to CRS without nasal polyps, CRSwNP is associated with greater clinical severity, a higher recurrence rate, and an increased frequency of lower airway comorbidities. CRSwNP affects 25%–30% of CRS patients and 1%–4% of the general population, leading to significant direct and indirect economic burdens on both patients and society. The annual incremental costs for patients with CRSwNP were $11,507 higher than those for patients without CRS in the United States. Another study found that in China, the average total direct cost per CRSwNP patient one year after surgery was $742.4.

Conventional treatment strategies for CRSwNP include intranasal and oral corticosteroids as well as endoscopic sinus surgery. Patients who do not respond to first‐line treatments, such as intranasal corticosteroids, within 6–12 weeks should have their treatment escalated to short‐term oral corticosteroids or surgical treatment. However, despite the long‐term use of intranasal corticosteroids and at least one course of systemic corticosteroids (SCS) and/or surgery, the disease remains uncontrolled in some patients, a condition referred to as uncontrolled CRSwNP. Studies indicate that approximately one-third of patients with CRSwNP have resistance to oral corticosteroids and need surgery to control the disease.

### Pathophysiology of chronic rhinosinusitis [^115vgz1K]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2011). Low credibility.

Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS), a disease presenting with chronic symptoms such as nasal obstruction, rhinorrhea, hyposmia, and facial pain, is highly prevalent and has a considerable impact on quality of life and health care expenditures. The disease is characterized by chronic inflammation of the sinonasal mucosa and can present with nasal polyps. Consensus classifies CRS into CRS with nasal polyps and CRS without nasal polyps.

This review illustrates the diversity of pathophysiological observations in CRS and highlights selected etiological hypotheses. A wide spectrum of alterations is described regarding histopathology, pattern of T cells and inflammatory effector cells, remodeling, immunoglobulin production, chemokine and eicosanoid production, and the role of microorganisms. The pathophysiological diversity observed in CRS seems to stand in contrast to its nonspecific clinical presentation, but is of the utmost importance in the development and application of highly individualized treatments. Identification of specific disease subgroups and their etiologies is an important and challenging task for future research.

### Endotyping in chronic rhinosinusitis-an EAACI task force report [^113ABMBz]. Allergy (2025). Low credibility.

Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is an inflammatory condition of the nose and paranasal sinuses. Its diagnosis requires a combination of symptoms — nasal blockage and/or nasal discharge, combined with facial pain/pressure and/or reduction or loss of smell — and compatible endoscopic findings, such as nasal polyps, edema, and purulent discharge, with optional radiological findings. Although the disease can occur in the context of systemic conditions like cystic fibrosis or granulomatosis with polyangiitis, or have a unilateral nature, such as a fungal ball, CRS is most commonly a primary, diffuse (bilateral) disease. CRS is a heterogeneous entity in terms of symptoms, mechanisms, prognosis, and therapy response, with distinct phenotypes and endotypes identifiable. Historically, international guidelines proposed a phenotypic classification of the disease based on the presence (CRSwNP) or absence (CRSsNP) of nasal polyps. Recent updates advocate for an endotypic classification based on the underlying activated immune/inflammatory pathways. This task force report summarizes the knowledge of CRS endotypes and the possibilities and limitations of endotyping CRS in clinical practice.

- **Immunological pathways**: Single or combined type 1, 2, and 3 immunological response pathways are activated to eliminate identified classes of pathogens, such as viruses, parasites, or bacteria/fungi.

	- **Type 1 (T1) canonical cytokines**: Include IFN-gamma (IFN‐γ) and IL‐12.

	- **Type 2 (T2) cytokines**: Include IL‐4, IL‐5, and IL‐13.

	- **Type 3 (T3) cytokines**: Include IL‐17A and IL‐22.

### Clinical practice guideline: Management of sinusitis [^114rNTrA]. Pediatrics (2001). Low credibility.

This clinical practice guideline formulates recommendations for health care providers regarding the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of children ages 1 to 21 years with uncomplicated acute, subacute, and acute bacterial sinusitis. It was developed through a comprehensive search and analysis of the medical literature. Expert consensus opinion was used to enhance or formulate recommendations where data were insufficient.

A subcommittee, composed of pediatricians with expertise in infectious disease, allergy, epidemiology, family practice, and pediatric practice, supplemented with an otolaryngologist and radiologist, was selected to formulate the practice parameter. Several other groups, including members of the American College of Emergency Physicians, American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, and American Academy of Asthma, Allergy and Immunology, as well as numerous national committees and sections of the American Academy of Pediatrics, have reviewed and revised the guideline.

Three specific issues were considered:
1. Evidence for the efficacy of various antibiotics in children.
2. Evidence for the efficacy of various ancillary, non-antibiotic regimens.
3. The diagnostic accuracy and concordance of clinical symptoms, radiography (and other imaging methods), and sinus aspiration.

It is recommended that the diagnosis of acute bacterial sinusitis be based on clinical criteria in children under 6 years of age who present with upper respiratory symptoms that are either persistent or severe. Although controversial, imaging studies may be necessary.

### Chronic invasive fungal sinusitis with negative histopathology: A diagnostic challenge [^116nWTxQ]. Ear, nose, & throat journal (2023). Low credibility.

Although the diagnosis of chronic invasive fungal sinusitis relies chiefly on the identification of invasive fungi on histology, the insidious nature of the disease can preclude detection of fungal organisms. Here, we present a case of chronic invasive fungal sinusitis with negative histopathologic findings and a definitive diagnosis made through fungal DNA detection. Clinicians should consider polymerase chain reaction an important complement to histology and culture in the diagnosis of chronic invasive fungal sinusitis.

### Medical management strategies in acute and chronic rhinosinusitis [^116hidHG]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2020). Low credibility.

Chronic rhinosinusitis has historically been considered to be caused by upper airway anatomical abnormalities. However, that concept has evolved, as it is now recognized as an inflammatory disorder of the nasal and sinus mucosa. Acute rhinosinusitis is usually caused by a viral infection, whereas chronic rhinosinusitis is a persistent and heterogeneous inflammatory disorder with increased expression of type 1, 2, or 17 cytokines in the nasal and sinus mucosa, similar to asthma. Exacerbations are caused by aeroallergens in allergic individuals and by irritants, pollutants, and viral/bacterial infections in all subjects. It may be categorized by phenotypes, such as chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps or without nasal polyps. Defined endotypes are based on underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. Knowledge of chronic rhinosinusitis endotypes will optimize management by employing targeted medical therapies. Understanding that rhinosinusitis is a heterogeneous inflammatory disease has led to the identification of various predisposing conditions and new medical treatment options, alongside the concept that rhinosinusitis is primarily a medical problem.

### Complications of allergic fungal sinusitis [^117D16wg]. The American Journal of Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Allergic fungal sinusitis is a syndrome of chronic noninvasive fungal sinusitis that results in the accumulation of eosinophil-rich allergic mucin within the paranasal sinuses. This mucin may become an expansile mass leading to complications that have not been well characterized or classified.

- **Methods**: Inclusion criteria for this study required meeting previously published diagnostic criteria and complications greater than nasal polyps or sinusitis itself. Four patients from our cohort and 30 patients identified in a literature search formed the study group.

- **Results**: The majority of patients had pre-existing asthma or allergic rhinitis, or both, and 37% had nasal polyps before presentation. However, 27% had no previous history of rhinosinusitis or nasal polyposis. Complications of allergic fungal sinusitis fell into discrete categories: ophthalmic (n = 13), sinobronchial allergic mycosis (n = 9), bony erosion (n = 8), cavernous venous thrombosis (n = 3), and otic involvement (n = 1).

- **Conclusion**: Visual symptoms, proptosis, headaches, and increased nasal symptoms, especially in association with bony erosions on sinus computed tomography, suggest allergic fungal sinusitis and its complications in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis and nasal polyps. Patients with allergic fungal sinusitis may present with a complication of the disease as the first symptom. Complications may be categorized into groups that facilitate surveillance and early identification.

### Contrasting the microbiomes from healthy volunteers and patients with chronic rhinosinusitis [^117Gi8Zo]. JAMA Otolaryngology–Head & Neck Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is defined as the persistent inflammation of the sinus and nasal passages lasting over three months. The etiology of CRS remains not well understood. To gain insights into the disease process, we contrasted the microbiome and immune response between patients with CRS and healthy controls.

A case versus control design was employed, with samples collected in the operating room of an institutional hospital or clinic. A total of thirty patients with CRS and twelve healthy controls undergoing surgery participated in the study. The microbiome was analyzed through deep sequencing of the bacterial 16S and fungal 18S ribosomal RNA genes. Immune response was measured by quantifying thirty different cytokines using multiplexed enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, while immune cells in the lavage were identified through flow cytometry. The immune response of peripheral blood leukocytes to the lavage microbiota was evaluated using an interleukin (IL)-5 enzyme-linked immunospot assay.

Results indicated a quantitative increase in most bacterial and fungal species in patients with CRS compared to controls; however, the microbiomes of patients with CRS were qualitatively similar to those of the controls. As these findings suggested that bacteria and fungi are not triggering CRS, a more detailed characterization of the immune response was carried out. Patients with CRS exhibited increased levels of cytokines such as IL-4, IL-5, IL-8, and IL-13, in addition to elevated levels of eosinophils and basophils in the lavage. Importantly, peripheral blood leukocytes is…

### Treatment options for chronic rhinosinusitis [^112Dt9y7]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2011). Low credibility.

Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is defined as persistent symptomatic inflammation of the nasal and sinus mucosa. Although insights into the pathophysiology of CRS have largely expanded over the last two decades, the exact etiology remains unknown and is likely due to multiple host and environmental factors. Treatments aim to reduce mucosal inflammation, control infection, and restore mucociliary clearance within the sinuses. The principal goal of this article is to outline a rational approach to the treatment of chronic sinus disease based on currently available diagnostic and therapeutic techniques. Emphasis is placed on management, therapeutic response, and the objective evaluation of therapeutic efficiency.

### Endotyping in chronic rhinosinusitis-an EAACI task force report [^115PnFXB]. Allergy (2025). Low credibility.

CRS pathophysiology involves different factors. On the one hand, there is a dysregulation of the homeostatic mechanism to repair the sinonasal epithelium (the epithelial–mesenchymal transition), leading to a dysfunctional epithelial barrier that is prone to inflammation. The cause of this alteration is unknown. However, in some patients, environmental factors (e.g. smoke from tobacco or heavy industry) or microbial exposures might play a role. Upon this dysfunctional barrier, some patients develop a T2 inflammation, leading to mucosal infiltration by Th2 cells, IgE‐producing B cells, group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2), M2 macrophages, eosinophils, basophils, mast cells, and IL‐4, IL‐5, or IL‐13 cytokines. Goblet cell and MUC activation increase the viscosity of secretions, whereas M2 macrophages contribute to generating fibrin meshes, which provide a scaffold for the polypoid degeneration of the (ethmoidal) mucosa. T2 inflammatory mediators also interfere with the secretions in the olfactory cleft, promote the infiltration of the olfactory epithelium by mast cells and eosinophils, and stimulate mature olfactory neurons, making them less responsive to aromatic compounds. All these aspects account for an impairment of smell in CRS individuals.

Efforts to achieve a better understanding of CRS include the study of environmental and host factors related to endotypes. The aim of the review is to provide an update on the knowledge of CRS endotypes. A literature search was conducted using Ovid Medline between January 2012 and September 2024, providing 23,835 search results.
