## Question

Is an etonogestrel implant a cure for varicose veins?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether an etonogestrel implant cures varicose veins. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the approved indications and pharmacology of the etonogestrel implant. Then, I should review the pathophysiology of varicose veins and the evidence-based treatments endorsed by major guidelines. Next, I will check whether any data support hormonal therapy, specifically progestins or etonogestrel, as a treatment for varicose veins. After that, I should verify any potential sources of confusion, such as surgical "implants", that are unrelated to contraceptives. Finally, I will synthesize a clinical conclusion and counseling points based on guideline-consistent care and safety considerations.

> Let me first confirm what an etonogestrel implant is and is not. The etonogestrel implant (Nexplanon) is a subdermal, single-rod progestin-only contraceptive that releases etonogestrel for up to 3 years; its FDA-labeled indication is contraception only, and there is no approved or evidence-based vascular therapeutic indication listed in the labeling or primary contraception guidelines, so I need to be careful not to infer off-label vascular benefits where none are described [^114tXMck] [^1164y2G1] [^114BUSJm].

> Next, I should review the disease in question. Varicose veins are dilated, tortuous superficial veins caused by venous valve incompetence and reflux with consequent venous hypertension and structural venous wall remodeling; this is fundamentally a hemodynamic and structural problem rather than a hormonal one, which already suggests a mechanistic disconnect from contraceptive implants, but let me verify that with primary sources on pathophysiology [^113xPezQ] [^1166665a].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — I need to check what guideline-directed treatments actually work for symptomatic varicose veins. High-quality guidelines recommend endovenous thermal ablation, ultrasound-guided foam sclerotherapy, and phlebectomy/stripping as definitive treatments that address reflux, with compression used for symptom control or postprocedural pain rather than as a curative strategy; medical options like micronized purified flavonoid fraction or Ruscus can help symptoms in select situations but are not curative, and none of these authoritative guidelines list hormonal therapy as a treatment for varicose veins [^114ZwG43] [^113R2dNo] [^116Hg5cC].

> Hmm, wait a minute — I should double-check whether any data suggest progestins improve varicose veins or reduce the need for venous procedures. One retrospective database analysis reported associations between systemic exogenous progestin exposure and reduced venous procedures; however, given confounding by indication, baseline differences, and the observational design, that signal should not be interpreted as causal therapeutic efficacy for varicose veins, and it does not demonstrate that an etonogestrel implant treats or cures varicose disease; importantly, this stands in contrast to established interventional therapies supported by randomized and guideline-level evidence [^115nzV1B] [^117ADHGW].

> Wait, let me verify a common source of confusion. A surgical paper described placing a silicone sheet at the saphenofemoral junction to reduce neovascularization after ligation; that "implant" is a local surgical barrier, not a systemic hormonal contraceptive, and it has nothing to do with an etonogestrel implant, so conflating these would be a category error [^113JRN94].

> I will now examine the mechanistic plausibility. Varicose vein formation is driven by venous hypertension and wall remodeling; to date, no evidence shows that progestin-only contraception reverses reflux, restores valve function, or remodels diseased veins, whereas experimental models have explored other pharmacologic pathways such as statins for venous remodeling, underscoring how different the mechanistic targets would need to be to alter disease biology, and reinforcing that etonogestrel has no demonstrated role here [^1166665a] [^115Y2xrv].

> But wait, what about safety angles that could muddy the waters? Combined hormonal contraceptives carry an increased risk of venous thromboembolism, including in some women with superficial venous disease, whereas progestin-only methods like etonogestrel implants have not shown a clear increase in VTE risk in aggregate analyses; none of this translates into treatment of varicose veins, and choosing contraception should be individualized while keeping venous risk profiles in mind rather than as a varicose vein therapy strategy [^115CdALk] [^11478oik] [^116xyW34].

> Let me reconsider the totality of evidence before concluding. Across FDA labeling, primary care and vascular guidelines, and the venous literature, there is no evidence that an etonogestrel implant treats or cures varicose veins; established care focuses on diagnosing reflux with duplex and offering endovenous ablation, sclerotherapy, or phlebectomy as indicated, with compression for symptom control or immediate postprocedural pain relief, and symptom-modifying phlebotonics in select cases, none of which include hormonal contraceptives as therapy [^113R2dNo] [^113fx7Ki] [^113xPezQ].

> Conclusion: No, an etonogestrel implant is not a cure for varicose veins; definitive management targets venous reflux and structural pathology via endovenous or surgical interventions, and hormonal contraceptives — including etonogestrel implants — are not recommended or supported by evidence for treating varicose veins, so I would counsel proceeding with guideline-based venous evaluation and therapy rather than relying on hormonal implants for venous disease [^114ZwG43] [^113R2dNo] [^113fx7Ki].

Current evidence does not support the etonogestrel implant as a **cure for varicose veins** [^113fx7Ki]. It is a contraceptive device with no evidence of therapeutic benefit for varicose veins, and current clinical guidelines **do not recommend** it for this purpose [^114tXMck] [^113R2dNo]. Management of varicose veins should **follow established treatments** such as compression therapy [^113R2dNo], sclerotherapy [^111FRP98], or endovenous ablation [^114ZwG43].

---

## Mechanism of action of etonogestrel implant

The etonogestrel implant is a subdermal contraceptive device that releases etonogestrel, a synthetic progestin, into the bloodstream [^1164y2G1]. Its primary mechanisms of action are suppression of ovulation, thickening of cervical mucus, and thinning of the endometrial lining, thereby preventing pregnancy. The implant provides **effective contraception for up to three years** [^114tXMck].

---

## Pathophysiology of varicose veins

Varicose veins are characterized by dilated, tortuous veins resulting from chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) [^113fx7Ki]. The underlying pathophysiology involves **venous valve incompetence**, increased venous pressure, and subsequent venous wall remodeling [^112agwWS]. Factors such as obesity, prolonged standing, pregnancy, and genetic predisposition contribute to their development and progression.

---

## Clinical evidence regarding etonogestrel implant and varicose veins

Currently, there is **no clinical evidence** from published studies demonstrating that the etonogestrel implant has any therapeutic effect on varicose veins. The implant is designed and approved solely for contraception [^114tXMck], and it has not been studied for treating or curing varicose veins.

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Clinical guidelines from reputable vascular societies, such as the Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS), American Venous Forum (AVF), and European Society for Vascular Surgery (ESVS) [^113fx7Ki], **do not mention or recommend** using the etonogestrel implant to treat varicose veins [^113R2dNo]. These guidelines focus on established treatments, including compression therapy, sclerotherapy, endovenous ablation, and surgical interventions [^114ZwG43].

---

## Potential risks and side effects of etonogestrel implant

While the etonogestrel implant is generally considered safe for contraceptive use, it is **associated with certain risks and side effects**, including:

- **Irregular menstrual bleeding**: Commonly reported by users [^113evB8w] [^111N8xNT].
- **Headaches**: Frequently reported side effect [^112rMCf8] [^1164y2G1].
- **Weight changes**: Some users report weight gain or loss [^112rMCf8] [^1164y2G1].
- **Local reactions**: Pain, irritation, swelling, bruising, or scarring at the insertion site [^111sPRbJ] [^1164y2G1].
- **Rare hypersensitivity reactions**: Such as eosinophilia or toxic epidermal necrolysis [^111sPRbJ] [^1113un2x].

There is **no evidence** that the implant specifically exacerbates or improves varicose vein symptoms.

---

## Alternative evidence-based treatments for varicose veins

Established and **evidence-based treatments** for varicose veins include:

- **Compression therapy**: Graduated compression stockings to reduce symptoms and prevent progression [^113R2dNo].
- **Sclerotherapy**: Injection of sclerosants to obliterate varicose veins [^114ZwG43].
- **Endovenous ablation**: Laser or radiofrequency ablation of incompetent veins [^113fx7Ki].
- **Surgical interventions**: Phlebectomy or vein stripping for severe cases [^114ZwG43] [^116u28tW].

These treatments are **supported by clinical evidence and guidelines**, whereas the etonogestrel implant is not [^113R2dNo].

---

## Conclusion

The etonogestrel implant **does not cure varicose veins**. It is a contraceptive device with no demonstrated therapeutic benefit for varicose veins, and current clinical guidelines do not recommend its use for this purpose. Patients seeking treatment for varicose veins should consider established, evidence-based therapies such as compression therapy, sclerotherapy, endovenous ablation, or surgical interventions [^113fx7Ki].

- **Evidence to support compression stockings for patients with varicose veins**:

	2.1.2. For patients with symptomatic varicose veins and axial reflux in the GSV or SSV who are candidates for intervention, we recommend superficial venous intervention over long-term compression stockings.
	*Guideline*: Grade of recommendation: 1 (strong), Quality of Evidence: B (moderate).

	2.1.3. For patients with symptomatic varicose veins and axial reflux in the AAGSV or PAGSV who are candidates for intervention, we suggest superficial venous intervention over long-term compression stockings.
	*Guideline*: Grade of recommendation: 2 (weak), Quality of Evidence: C (low to very low).

	2.1.4. In patients with symptomatic varicose veins who are candidates for endovenous therapy and wish to proceed with treatment, we suggest against a 3-month trial of compression therapy prior to intervention.
	*Guideline*: Grade of recommendation: 2 (weak), Quality of Evidence: B (moderate).

- **Rationale**:

	- There is no rationale for a 3-month trial of compression therapy before intervention for patients with CEAP C2 class symptomatic varicose veins who are candidates for endovenous therapy and wish to proceed. Evidence for the efficacy of compression therapy in these patients is less than for the efficacy of endovenous ablation.

### Superficial venous disease and combined hormonal contraceptives: a systematic review [^115CdALk]. Contraception (2016). High credibility.

Superficial venous disease, which includes superficial venous thrombosis (SVT) and varicose veins, may be associated with a higher risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Use of combined hormonal contraceptives (CHCs) has been associated with an increased risk of VTE compared with non-use. Little is known about whether the use of CHCs by women with superficial venous disease may further elevate the risk of VTE.

- **Objectives**: To investigate evidence regarding the risk of VTE in women with SVT or varicose veins who use CHCs compared with non-CHC users.

- **Methods**: We searched the PubMed database for all English-language articles published from database inception through September 2014. We included primary research studies that examined women with SVT or varicose veins who used CHCs compared to women with these conditions who did not use CHCs. Outcomes of interest included VTE (among women with SVT or varicose veins) and SVT (for those with varicose veins).

- **Results**: Two studies were identified that met the inclusion criteria. One fair-quality case-control study reported an odds ratio (OR) for VTE of 43.0 (95% confidence interval [CI] 15.5–119.3) among women with SVT using oral contraceptives (OCs) compared with nonusers without SVT. The OR for VTE was also increased for women with SVT not using OCs (OR 5.1; 95% CI 2.8–9.5) and for women without SVT using OCs (OR 4.0; 95% CI 3.3–4.7) compared with nonusers without SVT. One fair-quality cohort study demonstrated that women with varicose veins had an increased rate of VTE with the use of OCs (1.85 per 1000 women-years [WY]).

### Prolonged use of the etonogestrel implant and levonorgestrel intrauterine device: 2 years beyond Food and Drug Administration-approved duration [^112evsRw]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Low credibility.

The subdermal contraceptive implant and the 52-mg levonorgestrel intrauterine device are currently Food and Drug Administration approved for 3 and 5 years of use, respectively. Limited available data suggest both methods are effective beyond that time. Demonstration of prolonged effectiveness will improve the cost-effectiveness of the device and potentially patient continuation and satisfaction.

- **Objective**: We sought to evaluate the effectiveness of the contraceptive implant and the 52-mg hormonal intrauterine device in women using the method for 2 years beyond the Food and Drug Administration-approved duration.

- **Study design**: We initiated this ongoing prospective cohort study in January 2012. We are enrolling women using the contraceptive implant or 52-mg levonorgestrel intrauterine device for a minimum of 3 and 5 years, respectively (started intrauterine device in ≥ 2007 or implant in ≥ 2009). Demographic and reproductive health histories, as well as objective body mass index, were collected. Implant users were offered periodic venipuncture for analysis of serum etonogestrel levels. The primary outcome, unintended pregnancy rate, was calculated per 100 woman-years. We analyzed baseline demographic characteristics using χ² test and Fisher exact test, and compared serum etonogestrel levels stratified by body mass index using the Kruskal-Wallis test.

- **Results**: Implant users (n = 291) have contributed 444.0 woman-years of follow-up. There have been no documented pregnancies in implant users during the 2 years of post-expiration follow-up.

### Estrogens, progestogens and thrombosis [^117C7Uz4]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2003). Low credibility.

Hundreds of millions of women worldwide use either oral contraceptives or postmenopausal hormone replacement. The use of oral contraceptives leads to an increased risk of venous thrombosis, myocardial infarction, stroke, and peripheral artery disease, with the highest risks occurring during the first year of use. Women with coagulation abnormalities experience a higher risk of venous thrombosis when using oral contraceptives or postmenopausal hormones compared to women without these abnormalities. The risk of venous thrombosis is also greater for preparations containing desogestrel or gestodene (third-generation progestogens) than for those containing levonorgestrel (second-generation progestogens). Previous thrombosis and obesity further increase the risk of oral contraceptive-related thrombosis. Hormone replacement therapy elevates the risk of venous thrombosis and has no beneficial or possibly even a detrimental effect on the risk of arterial disease. The risk of arterial disease in oral contraceptive users and users of hormone replacement therapy is, at most, weakly affected by the presence of prothrombotic abnormalities.

As discussed before, the CEAP classification is not a severity scale but a classification scheme for patients with chronic venous disorders describing the clinical, etiologic, anatomical, and pathophysiologic features. Conceptually, however, it has often been pondered whether patients with varicose veins (C2) can undergo treatment to prevent progression to CVI later in life. In the Bonn Vein Study, 1978 participants were followed up for a mean of 6.6 years. The prevalence of varicose veins rose from 22.7% to 25.1%. Participants with C2 disease increased to higher C-classes in 19.8% for nonsaphenous varicose veins and in 31.8% for saphenous varicose veins. The main risk factor for progression was obesity.

The Edinburgh Vein Study had a 13-year follow-up; a progression rate of 57.8% (4.3% per year) was reported. Of those with C2 disease at baseline, 31.9% progressed to CVI. Risk factors for progression included a family history of varicose veins, previous DVT, and obesity. Kostas et al. followed 73 mostly asymptomatic contralateral limbs for 5 years in patients who underwent treatment of symptomatic varicose veins of one lower extremity. CVD progression was significantly less in patients who were not obese and did not gain weight during the study. Patients who did not use compression stockings preoperatively and during the follow-up or had stopped using them also had a significantly higher incidence of progression compared with those who used compression.

### Contraception for the transplant patient [^112zz6oX]. Seminars in Perinatology (2007). Low credibility.

Patients who have had an organ transplant require highly effective contraception. Intrauterine devices, depo-medroxyprogesterone acetate, and implantable etonorgestrel exhibit the highest efficacy, coupled with the minimal likelihood of interaction with antirejection medication regimens. While combined hormonal contraceptives and progestin-only pills are acceptable methods for patients without additional contraindications, the use of barrier methods is recommended for any patient entering a new sexual relationship and as a supplement to other methods. Consultation with a gynecologist experienced in providing contraceptives to medically complicated patients is advised for all women of reproductive age who have received an organ transplant.

Evidence

Nonsaphenous, pelvic origin varicose veins occur in women in the medial and posterior thigh, vulva, and inguinal area. They are the result of reflux from the internal iliac vein through the inguinal, obturator, perineal, and gluteal escape points. Vulvar varicosities are estimated to occur in 22% to 34% of women with varicose veins of the pelvis and in 18% to 22% of pregnant women.

Seventy-two symptomatic patients with pelvic-source varicose veins were studied; however, only 7% had chronic pelvic pain. In a systematic review of 13 studies on ovarian vein embolization in 866 women, the technical success was 99.8%, and significant improvement of pelvic pain was reported in nine studies. In one study, lower extremity varicosities recurred only in 13% at 5 years after embolization. Hartung et al. reported 51% improvement in lower extremity varicosity following ovarian vein embolization in 119 women, who had both pelvic symptoms and lower extremity varicose veins. In another study of 43 patients, Castenmiller et al. showed improvement after ovarian vein embolization in the lower extremity varicose veins in 14%, but the success rate was 88% for treatment of vulvar varicose veins.

Gavrilov reported good clinical results with the direct treatment of vulvar varicosities with FS and phlebectomy. In 32 patients with asymptomatic pelvic varicose veins, phlebectomy alone for vulvar varices resulted in no recurrence at 3 to 8 years after the procedure. Sclerotherapy was effective at 1 year in 10 of 12 patients. Consensus of experts supports the strategy of direct treatment of pelvic origin varicose veins.

### A systematic review and meta-analysis of venous thrombosis risk among users of combined oral contraception [^113Nhi99]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2018). Low credibility.

The meta-analysis included relative risk estimates of venous thromboembolism (VTE) that reflected comparisons between pills containing specific progestogen and levonorgestrel formulations. The preferred risk estimates were those with a reference group of users of monophasic combined oral contraceptives (COCs) containing 30 μg of ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel. In some cases, studies reported risk estimates compared with levonorgestrel-containing COCs as a group but noted that the monophasic preparation represented at least 50% of the total exposure; other studies presented risk estimates compared with any low-dose levonorgestrel COC.

If studies reported multiple risk estimates for users of levonorgestrel-containing COCs, the risk estimates for the most specific formulations were chosen. In cases where nonusers were the reference group and risk estimates for levonorgestrel and other progestogen-containing COCs were available, risk estimates with levonorgestrel as the reference group were calculated for inclusion in the meta-analysis. When studies presented risk ratios for multiple COCs containing the same progestogen at a specific ethinyl estradiol dose, a combined risk ratio for that progestogen was calculated.

### Varicose remodeling of veins is suppressed by 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors [^115Y2xrv]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Despite the high prevalence of chronic venous insufficiency and varicose veins in the Western world, suitable pharmaceutical therapies for these venous diseases have not been explored at the time of writing. In this context, we recently reported that a chronic increase in venous wall stress or biomechanical stretch is sufficient to cause the development of varicose veins through the activation of the transcription factor activator protein 1.

- **Methods and results**: We investigated whether deleterious venous remodeling is suppressed by the pleiotropic effects of statins. In vitro, activator protein 1 activity was inhibited by two 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, rosuvastatin and atorvastatin, in stretch-stimulated human venous smooth muscle cells. Correspondingly, both statins inhibited venous smooth muscle cell proliferation as well as expression of the activator protein 1 target gene monocyte chemotactic protein 1. In isolated mouse veins exposed to an increased level of intraluminal pressure, statin treatment diminished proliferation of venous smooth muscle cells and protein abundance of monocyte chemotactic protein 1 while suppressing the development of varicose veins in a corresponding animal model by almost 80%. Further analyses of human varicose vein samples from patients chronically treated with statins indicated a decrease in venous smooth muscle cell proliferation and monocyte chemotactic protein 1 abundance compared with samples from untreated patients.

- **Conclusions**: Our findings imply that both atorvastatin and rosuvastatin effectively inhibit the development of varicose veins, at least partially, by suppressing crucial processes in venous smooth muscle cells.

### Can interposition of a silicone implant after sapheno-femoral ligation prevent recurrent varicose veins [^113JRN94]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

To investigate whether a silicone implant at the sapheno-femoral ligation site could prevent revaricosities, two non-randomised groups of patients were studied prospectively. In Group A, 173 patients and 212 limbs underwent sapheno-femoral ligation, while 172 patients and 210 limbs additionally had a piece (2x3cm) of silicone sheet sutured to the saphenous stump to cover the anterior half of the common femoral vein. The implant was fixed in apposition to the deep vein by carefully closing the cribriform fascia. Colour duplex scanning was performed after 2 and 12 months.

In the no-implant group, neovascularisation was observed in 35 (17%) limbs after 12 months, but only in 13 (6%) limbs treated with a silicone implant (p < 0.05).

Interposition of a partition of silicone implant seems to lower the incidence of neovascularisation one year after saphenofemoral ligation. This technique may constitute an efficient method to prevent recurrence at the correctly ligated saphenous stump.

Part II: Endorsed by the Society of Interventional Radiology and the Society for Vascular Medicine [^116u28tW]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2024). High credibility.

In general, treatment for primary or recurrent varicose veins, irrespective of axial competence, has been shown to be effective and is indicated for patients with symptomatic C2 disease.

- **Consensus statement**: Surgical intervention for symptomatic varicose veins has been widely accepted as an effective, appropriate therapy with good outcomes for pain reduction and improvement in quality of life (QOL).

- **Evidence**: A Cochrane review in 2004 compared treatments of varicose veins with surgery versus sclerotherapy and concluded that there was insufficient evidence to preferentially recommend the use of sclerotherapy or surgery. A systematic review in 2009 by Leopardi et al. concluded that sclerotherapy and phlebectomy may be appropriate in patients with minor superficial varicose veins not related to reflux of the saphenous system, or as a post- or adjunctive treatment of varicose tributaries, but data were limited. A recent Cochrane review in 2021 addressed the efficacy of sclerotherapy alone for the treatment of varicose veins. The study included 28 RCTs involving 4278 participants. None of the RCTs compared sclerotherapy, however, to no intervention or to pharmacological therapy. There was very low to low-certainty evidence that foam sclerotherapy alone improved cosmetic appearance, residual varicose veins, and symptoms compared with placebo, and possibly improved QOL and venous clinical severity score (VCSS). The study concluded that there is a need for high-quality trials using standardized sclerosant doses, with well-defined outcome measures and measurement time points to increase the certainty of the evidence.

### Design of a treatment satisfaction measure for patients undergoing varicose vein treatment: Venous Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (VenousTSQ) [^117RPajr]. The British Journal of Surgery (2023). Low credibility.

Analysis of participants' spontaneous mentions indicated that items asking about information, discomfort/pain, compression, and side effects/after-effects are the most important. This was largely confirmed by the importance rating survey, which found that almost all participants described these items as either 'very important' or 'important'. There were two exceptions: 'Somewhat important' was the rating given by participant 12 for the discomfort/pain item and by participant 13 for the compression item. Participant 12 reported experiencing little discomfort or pain during the procedure and having no serious health problems or previous medical procedures. This might have contributed to his choice of rating the discomfort/pain item as having less importance compared with the other participants. Participant 13 did not find the need to wear compression stockings bothersome, although this view was unusual. Feedback from clinicians and most participants indicates that the need to wear compression stockings and bandages is a significant source of dissatisfaction.

It is generally appreciated that the provision of accessible information about treatment is important for patients' treatment satisfaction. Although the level of provision is usually viewed as an indicator of service satisfaction, rather than treatment satisfaction, the size of the discrepancies between the level of information provided versus the amount of information patients feel they need may well be treatment-specific. Given the importance that patients with varicose veins placed on being well informed about the treatment, it is crucial for service providers to address these informational gaps diligently.

### A low-cost and high-fidelity animal model for nonpalpable implant removal: A pilot study [^113dAtR2]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Low credibility.

The subdermal contraceptive etonogestrel implant, Nexplanon (Organon, New Jersey, USA), is widely used around the world. Despite a new applicator design aimed at facilitating correct insertion compared to the initial version of Implanon, and with updated site insertion recommendations, deeper insertions continue to occur in 1 out of 1000 women. The manufacturer recommends optimal placement between the dermis and the subcutaneous tissue, ensuring immediate palpability of the implant; however, there is no recommended normal depth of implant insertion. A deeply inserted implant is defined as nonpalpable.

Removal can be challenging even in specialized centers with experts experienced in removing nonpalpable implants. Training programs for removing deeply inserted implants would be beneficial, requiring initial localization via ultrasonography (US) followed by surgical removal. Since visualization by US is impossible on plastic or rubber model arms due to the foam layer simulating the soft tissue beneath a thin vinyl skin, we developed a low-cost and high-fidelity animal model where anatomical structures resemble the human arm. This pilot study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of nonpalpable implant US detection and removal.

Placebo implants were deeply inserted into chicken legs. The primary outcome measure was evaluating the localization of deep implants by US. The secondary outcome measure was confirming the possibility of surgical removal using a visual analogue scale (VAS), where the operator rated the technical difficulties of implantation.

In this clinical recommendation, we review the evidence supporting the use of the copper intrauterine device, levonorgestrel intrauterine devices, and etonogestrel subdermal implants beyond the Food and Drug Administration-approved duration of use for contraception (extended use). Clinicians should discuss effectiveness, as well as other clinical considerations, with patients to allow them to make contraceptive decisions that support their reproductive goals and clinical needs. Extended use of long-acting reversible contraception may be a safe, effective, and desirable option for many patients.

### The care of patients with varicose veins and associated chronic venous diseases: Clinical practice guidelines of the Society for Vascular Surgery and the American Venous Forum [^115Z7FMz]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2011). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for varicose veins, specifically concerning advanced imaging, the AVF/SVS 2011 guidelines recommend obtaining CTV, MRV, ascending and descending contrast venography, and intravascular ultrasonography selectively in patients with varicose veins and more advanced chronic venous conditions. These may include, but are not limited to, post-thrombotic syndrome, thrombotic or non-thrombotic iliac vein obstruction (May-Thurner syndrome), pelvic congestion syndrome, nutcracker syndrome, venous malformations (VMs), venous trauma, tumors, and planned open or endovascular venous interventions.

### Varicose remodeling of veins is suppressed by 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors [^111gruaE]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

The term chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) is often used to functionally describe the full spectrum of venous diseases, such as the development of varicose veins. Depending on the population and study design, the prevalence of CVI has been reported in up to 40% of women and 17% of men. The mean prevalence of varicose veins in the adult population varies between 5% and 30%, with a female predominance. As one of the most common medical conditions in the United States, health care costs for the treatment of CVI-associated diseases, such as venous ulcers, exceed $1 billion annually. Aside from surgical intervention, no causative treatment options are available to inhibit the maladaptive venous remodeling that leads to the formation of varicose veins or varicose recurrences after surgical interventions. This is mainly due to the lack of mechanistic knowledge identifying molecular targets that are rate-limiting for the onset or progression of venous insufficiency or the development of varicose veins.

### Compression stockings for the initial treatment of varicose veins in patients without venous ulceration [^116teyHG]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Compression hosiery or stockings are often the first line of treatment for varicose veins in people without either healed or active venous ulceration. Evidence is required to determine whether the use of compression stockings can effectively manage and treat varicose veins in the early stages. This is an update of a review first published in 2011.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effectiveness of compression stockings as the only and initial treatment of varicose veins in patients without healed or active venous ulceration.

- **Search methods**: For this update, the Cochrane Peripheral Vascular Diseases Group Trials Search Coordinator searched the Specialised Register (last searched August 2013) and CENTRAL (2013, Issue 5).

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were included if they involved participants diagnosed with primary trunk varicose veins without healed or active venous ulceration (Clinical, Etiology, Anatomy, Pathophysiology (CEAP) classification C2 to C4). Included trials assessed compression stockings versus no treatment, compression versus placebo stockings, or compression stockings plus drug intervention versus drug intervention alone. Trials comparing different lengths and pressures of stockings were also included. Trials involving other types of treatment for varicose veins (either as a comparator to stockings or as an initial non-randomised treatment), including sclerotherapy and surgery, were excluded.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two authors assessed the trials for inclusion and quality (SS and LR). SS extracted the data.

### Best practices for counseling adolescents about the etonogestrel implant [^111C4unW]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2020). Low credibility.

Among young individuals, the ease of use, high efficacy, and significant acceptability make the etonogestrel contraceptive implant a crucial option for this age group. Adolescent-friendly, patient-centered counseling takes into account the patient's cognitive development, the influence of friends and family, as well as their personal preferences and values. It is beneficial to use age-appropriate language, graphics, and models to explain contraceptive options and relevant side effects. Effectiveness, reversibility, safety, noncontraceptive benefits, and potential side effects are essential attributes that should be discussed when adolescents are selecting a contraceptive method. This review describes recommended best practices for counseling adolescents about the etonogestrel implant, enabling them to make informed and prudent decisions regarding this contraceptive method.

### The 2023 Society for Vascular Surgery, American Venous Forum, and American Vein and Lymphatic Society clinical practice guidelines for the management of varicose veins of the lower extremities. Part II: Endorsed by the Society of Interventional Radiology and the Society for Vascular Medicine [^1141dL6X]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2024). Low credibility.

A second broader meta-analysis included 47 randomized trials, 105 prospective cohort studies, 67 retrospective cohort studies, and 2 case-control studies, including a total of 476,266 patients undergoing a variety of superficial endovenous interventions with the exclusion of open venous surgery. Notably, most studies excluded patients with a history of DVT. Although significant heterogeneity precluded analysis of all study arms, among prospective studies, additional pharmacological prophylaxis reduced the incidence of DVT to 0.73% (95% CI, 0.52%-1.02%) from 1.31% (1.15%-1.48%) for mechanical prophylaxis alone (compression stockings/bandages). No significant difference was noted between single-dose and extended pharmacoprophylaxis. There were no significant differences in PE (0.14%, 0.07%-0.28% vs. 0.16%, 0.15%-0.18%) or EHIT III to IV (0.35%, 0.09%-1.40% vs. 0.88%, 0.28%-2.70%) when comparing pharmacoprophylaxis to mechanical prophylaxis alone. Major bleeding was quite rare (1 case) while minor bleeding was observed in 0% to 10% of patients. Risk of bias was estimated to be high, and the quality of evidence was moderate among randomized trials and very low among non-randomized trials.

A systematic review included in the AVF/SVS EHIT guidelines, which included only retrospective observational studies, failed to show a lower incidence of EHIT with pharmacological thromboprophylaxis.

11.2.2. For patients undergoing endovenous ablation, routine risk stratification should be performed to assess the need for periprocedural thromboprophylaxis.

### Contraceptive failure of etonogestrel implant in patients treated with antiretrovirals including efavirenz [^113MvUY7]. Contraception (2012). Low credibility.

Contraception for HIV-positive women is a complex issue. Although the use of condoms is recommended, complementary methods of contraception are often prescribed. Antiretroviral therapy can lead to drug interactions and modify the efficacy of hormonal contraception. Two unintended pregnancies suggest that etonogestrel implants should be used with caution in patients on efavirenz.

### Nexplanon [^1164y2G1]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Hepatic impairment**: No studies were conducted to evaluate the effect of hepatic disease on the disposition of Nexplanon. The use of Nexplanon in women with active liver disease is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4)].

- **Overweight women**: The effectiveness of the etonogestrel implant in women who weighed more than 130% of their ideal body weight has not been defined because such women were not studied in clinical trials. Serum concentrations of etonogestrel are inversely related to body weight and decrease with time after implant insertion. It is therefore possible that Nexplanon may be less effective in overweight women, especially in the presence of other factors that decrease serum etonogestrel concentrations, such as concomitant use of hepatic enzyme inducers.

### A systematic review and meta-analysis of venous thrombosis risk among users of combined oral contraception [^1116Zdvy]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2018). Low credibility.

In the present systematic review and meta-analysis, PubMed and the Cochrane Library databases were searched for all articles on the association between combined oral contraceptive (COC) use and venous thromboembolism (VTE) in all languages published from database inception through September 15, 2016, using a combination of search terms for oral contraception and venous thrombosis. Additionally, the reference lists from identified studies and key review articles were hand-searched for additional studies.

For the exposure, studies were included that reported results for users of COCs with low-dose ethinyl estradiol (dose < 50 μg) coupled with one of the following progestogens: cyproterone acetate, desogestrel, dienogest, drospirenone, gestodene, norgestimate, or levonorgestrel. Studies were only included if the risk estimates were reported separately by COC formulation, including monophasic formulations that had the same dose of ethinyl estradiol in all active pills and multiphasic formulations that had varying doses of ethinyl estradiol throughout the cycle, provided they had the same progestogen. Studies were excluded if COCs containing 50 μg of ethinyl estradiol or more accounted for more than 10% of the total exposure. Also excluded were articles that only reported the risk of VTE among a mixed group of COC users with different progestogen-containing COCs, such as "third generation", and articles where the reference group cited the use of COC with non-specified progestogens. Five of the included studies did not clearly state the estrogen dose contained.

### Relationship between etonogestrel level and BMI in women using the contraceptive implant for more than 1 year [^112p1bzD]. Contraception (2016). Low credibility.

Progestin-only contraceptive methods, including the 3-year, single-rod etonogestrel (ENG) implant, may be preferred for obese women to avoid additional estrogen-related thrombosis risk; however, whether obese women receive an ENG sufficient dose to suppress ovulation is understudied. Our analysis expands on the limited information currently available by studying ENG levels related to body mass index (BMI) in a community sample of primarily Hispanic women. This cross-sectional, descriptive study of 52 long-term implant users found comparable ENG levels across a wide BMI range (p = .1). These results further support that ENG levels are independent of BMI through 3 years of implant use and are thus reassuring that ENG implants will be effective for women of all BMIs.

Evidence

Insurance companies and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services frequently require a three-month trial of compression stockings before intervention for patients with C2 disease, despite a lack of evidence for efficacy. In a UK-based cost analysis, accounting for clinical recurrences and the need for further treatment, the analysis included the cost of the procedure, subsequent procedures, and quality-adjusted life-years. Across all measures, compression therapy was found to be inferior to minimally invasive endovenous therapies, including ultrasound-guided foam sclerotherapy (UGFS) and endovenous thermal ablation. Although the cost effectiveness was calculated for the UK, sensitivity analysis suggests that the conclusions are robust to substantial changes in relative cost, and pertinent to other global healthcare markets.

As an example, the REACTIV Trial involved a subgroup of patients with severe varicosities randomized to surgical therapy (high ligation and stripping [HL&S], phlebectomy) compared with compression therapy. Consistently, surgical therapy produced better results regarding anatomical disease extent, patient satisfaction, quality of life (QOL), and cost effectiveness.

- **Compression therapy after intervention**: In patients undergoing thermal ablation for saphenous incompetence, with or without concomitant phlebectomy, we suggest postprocedure compression therapy for a minimum of one week for pain reduction.

	- Guideline: Grade of recommendation: 2 (weak), quality of evidence: B (moderate).

Rationale

Compression therapy has been used to reduce postoperative bleeding, bruising, edema, and pain after thermal ablation.

### Systemic exogenous progestins with or without estrogens are associated with decreased rates of venous procedures for varicose veins [^115nzV1B]. Journal of Vascular Surgery. Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2025). Low credibility.

The study utilized data from the TriNetX US Collaborative Network (Cambridge, MA), which provided access to records of approximately 112 million patients across 63 healthcare organizations in the United States. These patients included those with private insurance, Medicare/Medicaid, and no insurance. TriNetX automatically compiles and reports data from a patient's electronic health record, covering demographics, diagnoses, procedures, and medications. The TriNetX database was selected for its significant statistical power and comprehensive representation of U.S. regions, including critical data on pregnancy and systemic progestin with estrogen (SPE) use, making it ideal for this study.

Databases specific to vascular surgery, such as the Vascular Quality Initiative, may not include data on pregnancy and SPE use due to limited relevance for vascular specialists. All patient data were de-identified prior to collection, use, and transmission, exempting the study from institutional review board approval.

A retrospective cohort investigation was conducted from January 1, 2013, to December 31, 2023. Patients aged 18 years or older with International Classification of Diseases, 10th edition, diagnoses of chronic venous insufficiency, asymptomatic varicose veins, and varicose veins with complications (including inflammation, ulceration, or unspecified complications) were identified. This population was subdivided into treatment groups based on SPE use.

Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2024). High credibility.

Patients may benefit from concomitant treatment of the varicose tributaries at the time of ablation. It is important for the treating physician to carefully evaluate and identify any varicose tributaries during the preoperative assessment and consider appropriate treatment at the time of ASV ablation. One option is to treat the ASV reflux, then allow the patient to recover, and only treat the tributary veins that remain after an interval of recovery. Another option is to treat the tributary veins concurrently with the ASV ablation.

- **Guidelines**: The multi-societal guidelines by the American Vein and Lymphatic Society, American Venous Forum, and Society for Vascular Surgery recommend ablation of refluxing venous trunks with concomitant phlebectomy or ultrasound-guided foam sclerotherapy (GSV and ASV GRADE 1C; accessory saphenous veins GRADE 2C). Staged management of tributaries is only suggested in the presence of compelling anatomic or medical reasons. A shared decision-making with the patient is recommended so that individual circumstances and wishes can be considered when the final treatment plan is developed. From an evidence-based perspective, it appears there may be an advantage to early concomitant treatment of the varicose tributaries rather than waiting to see if they regress with time.

- **Inadequate resolution of symptoms and varicose tributaries after ASV ablation**: In preoperative planning and follow-up after treatment, it is important to consider there can be other sources of varicose tributaries distinct from the ASV reflux.

The AVF/AVLS/SVS 2024 guidelines recommend considering either endovenous laser ablation or radiofrequency ablation in patients with symptomatic recurrent varicose veins due to persistent or recurrent reflux at the groin. This is applicable if there is a straight great saphenous vein stump, long enough for thermal ablation. For recurrence due to neovascularization, sclerotherapy or phlebectomy should be performed.

### Systemic exogenous progestins with or without estrogens are associated with decreased rates of venous procedures for varicose veins [^117ADHGW]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2025). Low credibility.

A database query yielded 674,838 controls with no systemic progestin exposure (SPE) after varicose vein (VV) diagnosis, 7,597 patients with subsequent combined estrogen and progestin (CEP) therapy, and 13,758 patients with subsequent progestin-only therapy after applying inclusion and exclusion criteria. The mean follow-up time for the control, CEP, and progestin-only cohorts was 5.5, 6.5, and 6.1 years, respectively.

Before propensity score matching, controls were significantly older than the CEP and progestin-only treatment groups (62.6 years vs 48.4 and 48.3 years, respectively; P < .001), more likely to be White (73% vs 71% vs 67%; P < .001), and Hispanic (28% vs 25% vs 27%; P < .001). Progestin-only cohorts demonstrated significantly higher rates of prior deep vein thrombosis (DVT) (8% vs 4% for controls; P < .001) and prior pregnancy (21% vs 3% for controls; P < .001).

As expected, the CEP cohort was the most likely to have prior CEP use (31% vs 1% for controls; P < .001), and the progestin cohort was most likely to have prior progestin-only use (38% vs 4% for controls; P < .001). Rates of venous procedures before the index event for all cohorts approximated 0%, ensuring that patients in treatment groups did not receive venous procedures during the interval between a VV diagnosis and SPE initiation. These patterns were consistent when stratifying by VV complication status.

### Eluryng [^116xyW34]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

In these studies, required or sponsored by regulatory agencies, etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring users had a risk of VTE similar to combined oral contraceptives (COCs) users. A large prospective, observational study, the Transatlantic Active Surveillance on Cardiovascular Safety of Etonogestrel and Ethinyl Estradiol Vaginal Ring (TASC), investigated the risk of VTE for new users, and women who were switching to or restarting etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring or COCs in a population that is representative of routine clinical users. The women were followed for 24 to 48 months. The results showed a similar risk of VTE among etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring users (VTE incidence 8.3 per 10,000 WY) and women using COCs (VTE incidence 9.2 per 10,000 WY). For women using COCs that did not contain the progestins desogestrel (DSG) or gestodene (GSD), VTE incidence was 8.9 per 10,000 WY.

A retrospective cohort study using data from four health plans in the US, including the FDA-funded study in Kaiser Permanente and Medicaid databases, showed that the VTE incidence for new users of etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring was 11.4 events per 10,000 WY. In contrast, new users of a levonorgestrel (LNG)-containing COC had 9.2 events per 10,000 WY, and users of other COCs available during the study had 8.2 events per 10,000 WY.

### Interactions between etonogestrel-releasing contraceptive implant and 3 antiretroviral regimens [^117XtnZ2]. Contraception (2022). Low credibility.

Long-acting reversible contraceptives are effective contraceptives for women with HIV, but there are limited data on etonogestrel implant and antiretroviral therapy pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions. We evaluated etonogestrel/antiretroviral therapy drug-drug interactions and the effects of etonogestrel on ritonavir-boosted-atazanavir, ritonavir-boosted-lopinavir, and efavirenz pharmacokinetics.

- **Study design**: We enrolled postpartum women using etonogestrel implants and receiving ritonavir-boosted-atazanavir, ritonavir-boosted-lopinavir, or efavirenz-based regimens between 2012 and 2015. Etonogestrel implants were inserted 2 to 12 weeks postpartum. We performed pharmacokinetic sampling pre-etonogestrel insertion and 6 to 7 weeks post-insertion. We measured antiretroviral concentrations pre and post-etonogestrel insertion and compared etonogestrel concentrations between antiretroviral regimens. We considered a minimum serum etonogestrel concentration of 90 pg/mL adequate for ovulation suppression.

- **Results**: We collected pharmacokinetic data for 74 postpartum women, 22 on ritonavir-boosted-atazanavir, 26 on ritonavir-boosted-lopinavir, and 26 on efavirenz. The median serum concentrations of etonogestrel when co-administered were highest with etonogestrel/ritonavir-boosted-atazanavir (604 pg/mL) and etonogestrel/ritonavir-boosted-lopinavir (428 pg/mL), and lowest with etonogestrel/efavirenz (125 pg/mL); p < 0.001. Minimum concentration (C min) of ritonavir-boosted-atazanavir and ritonavir-boosted-lopinavir were lower after etonogestrel implant insertion.

### A systematic review and meta-analysis of venous thrombosis risk among users of combined oral contraception [^1118NXQ5]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2018). Low credibility.

Use of low-dose combined oral contraceptives (COCs) containing certain progestogens was associated with an increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) compared to those containing levonorgestrel.

Specifically:

- **High-risk progestogen-containing COCs**:
	- **Cyproterone**: Based on nine studies (references 17, 23, 29, 30, 31, 36, 41, 45, 46), cyproterone demonstrated a higher risk of VTE.
	- **Desogestrel**: Reported in 16 studies (references 13, 15, 17, 23, 24, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 41, 42, 43, 45, 46), an increased risk was noted.
	- **Drospirenone**: Findings from 10 studies (references 3, 15, 16, 17, 28, 31, 35, 44, 45, 46) suggested a similar risk elevation.
	- **Gestodene**: Based on 12 studies (references 13, 23, 24, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 41, 42, 45, 46), gestodene was also associated with an increased risk.

Conversely, the use of certain COCs did not show a significant increase in the risk of VTE:

- **Lower-risk progestogen-containing COCs**:
	- **Dienogest**: Only two studies (references 17, 44) reported on dienogest use, with an imprecise estimate showing no significant association with increased risk.
	- **Norgestimate**: Revealed in nine studies (references 15, 17, 23, 29, 30, 31, 34, 45, 46), there was no increased risk compared to levonorgestrel-containing COCs.

The heterogeneity was moderate (I² = 30%-66%) for all pooled analyses, except for norgestimate (I² = 15%).

### A 12-month multicenter, randomized study comparing the levonorgestrel intrauterine system with the etonogestrel subdermal implant [^113xBwc5]. Fertility and Sterility (2016). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to compare the levonorgestrel intrauterine system (LNG-IUS 8), which has an average levonorgestrel release rate of approximately 8 μg/24 hours during the first year (total levonorgestrel content 13.5 mg; Jaydess/Skyla), with the etonogestrel (ENG) subdermal implant (total content, 68 mg), focusing on the 12-month discontinuation rate as the primary outcome.

This was a randomized, open-label, phase III study conducted across thirty-eight centers in six European countries. The study population consisted of 766 healthy nulliparous and parous women aged 18–35 years. Participants received either the LNG-IUS 8 or the ENG implant.

- **Intervention**: The LNG-IUS 8 or the ENG implant.
- **Main outcome measures**: Discontinuation rate, by treatment group, at Month 12.

The 12-month discontinuation rates were 19.6% for the LNG-IUS 8 group and 26.8% for the ENG implant group. The -7.2% difference was statistically significant (95% confidence interval -13.2%, -1.2%). Fewer women in the LNG-IUS 8 group discontinued due to increased bleeding (3.2% vs. 11.3%) or adverse events (14.3% vs. 21.8%). At 12 months, a greater percentage of women in the LNG-IUS 8 group compared to the ENG implant group were "very/somewhat satisfied" with their bleeding pattern (60.9% vs. 33.6%) and expressed a preference to use their study treatment after study completion (70.1% vs. 58.5%).

The conclusion of the study was that the LNG-IUS 8 was associated with a significantly lower 12-month discontinuation rate compared with the ENG implant; this was primarily because ENG implant users frequently discontinued due to increased bleeding. More LNG-IUS 8 users than ENG implant users reported being "very/s…

### Large varicose vein closure: A comprehensive review [^115YpVK3]. Dermatologic Surgery (2022). Low credibility.

The treatment of chronic venous disease and varicose veins has significant psychosocial and economic impact. The great saphenous vein commonly develops incompetence and reflux. Therefore, it has been the focus of therapy for many years.

- **Objective**: To review the published medical literature relating to large varicose vein closure and provide a guide for the efficacy and safety of closure techniques.

- **Methods**: A comprehensive search of the English language literature was conducted up to and including December 2021. All references pertaining to large varicose vein closure were reviewed.

- **Results**: There are multiple safe and effective minimally invasive methods to achieve occlusion of incompetent great saphenous veins. The most widely used method is endovenous thermal ablation. Other nonthermal, tumescent, and nontumescent methods can also be used.

- **Conclusion**: Proper knowledge of vein anatomy, ultrasound, and vein closure procedures is needed to ensure safe and effective outcomes.

### Systematic review of treatments for varicose veins [^112UyV8e]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

This systematic review compares the safety and efficacy of varicose vein treatments, including conservative therapy, sclerotherapy, phlebectomy, endovenous laser therapy, radiofrequency ablation, and surgery involving saphenous ligation and stripping. Systematic searches of medical bibliographic databases were conducted in February 2008 to identify suitable studies published from January 1988 onward. Articles were considered eligible for inclusion through the application of a predetermined protocol. Safety and effectiveness data from the comparison of two or more varicose vein procedures were extracted and analyzed.

Seventeen studies, published between 2003 and 2007, were included in this review. Serious adverse events were rare; minor adverse events were more common but generally self-limiting. All treatments displayed levels of effectiveness depending on the extent of the vein in question. Short-term advantages appeared to be associated with sclerotherapy and endovenous treatments, while long-term effectiveness was more apparent following surgical intervention. Evidence suggests conservative therapy is less effective than sclerotherapy and surgery for the treatment of varicose veins. Ligation with stripping plus phlebectomy is generally regarded as the "gold standard" for treating primary long saphenous veins. Sclerotherapy and surgery both appear to have a place in the management of varicose veins. Sclerotherapy and phlebectomy may also be more appropriate in patients with minor superficial varicose veins not related to reflux of the saphenous system or as a post- or adjunctive therapy.

### SPL drug information for etonogestrel / ethinylestradiol [^116N55cR]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of etonogestrel / ethinylestradiol PV (also known as EnilloRing, EluRyng):

- **Arterial thromboembolism, risk for VTE**: Use caution in patients with risk factors for arterial vascular disease, including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, tobacco use, hypercholesterolemia, and obesity, or VTE, such as personal or family history of VTE, obesity, and systemic lupus erythematosus.

- **Exacerbation of angioedema**: Use caution in women with hereditary angioedema.

- **Exacerbation of chloasma**: Use caution in women with a history of chloasma gravidarum.

- **Exacerbation of migraine**: Use caution in patients with migraine.

- **Exacerbation of vaginal irritation, vaginal rash, ulcer**: Use extreme caution in women with conditions that make the vagina more susceptible to vaginal irritation or ulceration.

- **Gallbladder disease, liver cancer, uterine cancer, breast cancer, headache**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as use of etonogestrel/ethinylestradiol has been associated with these adverse events.

- **Hypertension**: Use caution in all patients, especially in older women and those with extended duration of use.

- **Pancreatitis**: Use caution in women with hypertriglyceridemia or a family history of hypertriglyceridemia.

- **Reactivation of depression**: Use caution in women with a history of depression.

- **Toxic shock syndrome**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as etonogestrel/ethinylestradiol has been associated with toxic shock syndrome.

- **Uterine bleeding**: Use caution in patients on oral contraceptives, especially during the first three months of use.

### Assessing the risk of venous thromboembolic events in women taking progestin-only contraception: a meta-analysis [^11478oik]. BMJ (2012). Low credibility.

A total of 2045 references were identified: 1827 from PubMed, 215 from Embase, and none from the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. Two journal articles were identified from reading reviews of the subject matter, and one from personal knowledge of an author. After removal of duplicates, 2022 records remained and were screened for inclusion in the analysis. Of these, 1922 were excluded after review of the abstract for lack of pertinence, leaving 100 articles to be retrieved.

The full text of these papers was evaluated: 92 were excluded, with eight remaining for analysis. The reasons for exclusion were as follows:

- **Not being a case-control or cohort study or randomized trial**: 41 articles.
- **Results not reported separately for a progestin-only arm**: 39 articles.
- **Absence of a no hormone arm**: 4 articles.
- **Progestin not administered for contraception only**: 4 articles.
- **Results for venous thromboembolism not reported**: 3 articles.
- **Old version of a study with a recent update**: 1 article.

### Systemic exogenous progestins with or without estrogens are associated with decreased rates of venous procedures for varicose veins [^112Kumao]. Journal of Vascular Surgery. Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2025). Low credibility.

Outcomes for control vs. progestin-only cohorts:

Propensity matching progestin-only and combined estrogen-progestin (CEP) patients resulted in 5549 women with any varicose vein (VV) diagnosis in each cohort. Women on CEP were no more likely to have deep vein thrombosis (DVT) (RR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.74–1.04; p = 0.139), but were more likely to become pregnant (RR, 1.71; 95% CI, 1.45–2.01; P < .001). There was no significant difference in the rates of stab phlebectomy (RR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.70–1.20; p = 0.52) or endovenous ablation (RR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.81–1.27; p = 0.86). The CEP cohort was more likely to undergo sclerotherapy (RR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.12–1.72; p = 0.003) and had more procedures overall (RR, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.00–1.34; p = 0.048). Among women with asymptomatic VV, CEP users were significantly less likely to have DVT (RR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.55–0.88; p = 0.003). Differences in the rates of pregnancy and venous intervention were similar when restricting the analysis to asymptomatic or symptomatic VVs.

### The 2023 Society for Vascular Surgery, American Venous Forum, and American Vein and Lymphatic Society clinical practice guidelines for the management of varicose veins of the lower extremities. Part II: Endorsed by the Society of Interventional Radiology and the Society for Vascular Medicine [^111pvtdD]. Journal of Vascular Surgery. Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2024). Low credibility.

Compared with elastic stockings alone, one study showed that HL&S plus elastic stockings reduced the risk of SVT extension and recurrence (RR, 0.09; 95% CI, 0.01–0.64) and was associated with a lower, statistically not significant, incidence of VTE (RR, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.08–1.78). However, most studies evaluating surgery and topical treatments did not report SVT progression, VTE, or adverse events.

A recent analysis from the RIETE registry of patients with thrombosis involving the main trunk of the GSV within 3 cm of the SFJ compared those treated with full dose fondaparinux or LMWH followed by VKA (227 patients) to those (147 patients) who received prophylactic doses of fondaparinux or intermediate dose LMWH. Those receiving full-dose anticoagulation received a longer course of treatment, and all patients were followed for 3 months. There was no difference in the incidence of VTE or re-SVT between the groups or in the safety outcomes of major bleeding or clinically non-major bleeding. The authors concluded that these findings are hypothesis-generating and support a trial evaluating the efficacy of preventative dose anticoagulation in comparison with therapeutic anticoagulation for treatment of SVT approaching the SFJ.

There is a paucity of studies specifically evaluating the management of SVT in patients with varicose veins. In a prospective observational study of 195 limbs with SVT and varicose veins treated with surgery or anticoagulation, there was no difference in the primary composite outcome of SVT extension/recurrence, incidence of DVT, or symptomatic PE.

### The management of unacceptable bleeding patterns in etonogestrel-releasing contraceptive implant users [^111N8xNT]. Contraception (2011). Low credibility.

The aim of this guidance is to review the management of unacceptable vaginal bleeding patterns in etonogestrel (ENG)-releasing contraceptive implant users, concentrating where possible on the evidence for pharmacological treatments and identifying a pragmatic approach where this is not possible. This article was developed in accordance with the methodology used for producing Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists' Green Top Guidelines.

The Cochrane Library (including the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, DARE, and EMBASE) and Medline (1966–2010) were searched using the relevant MeSH terms, including all subheadings. This was combined with a keyword search using terms such as "progestogen only contraceptives", "contraceptive implants", "progestogen implants", "etonogestrel implants", "irregular bleeding", "unpredictable bleeding", "bleeding irregularity", and "bleeding pattern". The search was limited to humans and the English language.

Enquiries for relevant information were also made to the pharmaceutical industry and researchers for missing studies. Although this is not a systematic review, two of the authors (D.M. I.S.F.) qualitatively assessed those papers reporting quantitative results involving treatments given either to stop or prevent bleeding in ENG or levonorgestrel contraceptive implant users.

### Eluryng [^113Qu4tM]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Thromboembolic disorders and other vascular problems**: Stop etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring use if an arterial thrombotic or venous thromboembolic event (VTE) occurs. Stop use if there is unexplained loss of vision, proptosis, diplopia, papilledema, or retinal vascular lesions. Evaluate for retinal vein thrombosis immediately [see Adverse Reactions (6)].

If feasible, stop the vaginal ring at least four weeks before and through two weeks after major surgery or other surgeries known to have an elevated risk of thromboembolism, as well as during and following prolonged immobilization.

Start the vaginal ring no earlier than four weeks after delivery in women who are not breastfeeding. The risk of postpartum thromboembolism decreases after the third postpartum week, whereas the risk of ovulation increases after the third postpartum week.

Use of combined hormonal contraceptives (CHCs) increases the risk of VTE. Known risk factors for VTE include smoking, obesity, and family history of VTE, in addition to other factors that contraindicate the use of CHCs [see Contraindications (4)].

Two epidemiologic studies that assessed the risk of VTE associated with the use of etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring are described below.

### Compression stockings for the initial treatment of varicose veins in patients without venous ulceration [^113zufNZ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Compression hosiery or stockings are often the first line of treatment for varicose veins in individuals who do not have either healed or active venous ulceration. Evidence is required to determine whether the use of compression stockings can effectively manage and treat varicose veins in the early stages.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effectiveness of compression stockings for the initial treatment of varicose veins in patients without healed or active venous ulceration.

- **Search methods**: The Cochrane Peripheral Vascular Disease Group searched their specialised register (last searched 31 May 2011) and CENTRAL (2011, Issue 2). Additionally, reference lists of relevant articles were reviewed, and authors of ongoing trials were contacted. There were no language restrictions.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were included if they involved participants diagnosed with primary trunk varicose veins without healed or active venous ulceration, according to the Clinical, Etiology, Anatomy, Pathophysiology (CEAP) classification C2 to C4. Included trials assessed compression stockings versus no treatment, compression versus placebo stockings, or compression stockings combined with drug intervention versus drug intervention alone. Trials comparing different lengths and pressures of stockings were also included. Trials involving other types of treatment for varicose veins, either as a comparator to stockings or as an initial non-randomised treatment, including sclerotherapy and surgery, were excluded.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two authors assessed the trials for inclusion and quality.

### Subcutaneous implant with etonogestrel (Implanon®) for catamenial exacerbations in a patient with cystic fibrosis: a case report [^112qThDu]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

The effect of female hormones on women with cystic fibrosis (CF) is a complex issue, given that women have different pulmonary exacerbation (PE) recurrence patterns according to the various phases of the menstrual cycle. Therefore, studying the history of PE pattern is essential to prescribe a contraceptive method — whether with exogenous estrogen, progesterone, or a combination of both — depending on the clinical symptoms' expression in each patient.

### Current advances in the pathogenesis of varicose veins [^1166665a]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2007). Low credibility.

Varicose veins have a wide prevalence and are characterized by their tortuous, dilated, and serpentine appearance. This pattern results from the disruption of the normal arrangement of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and smooth muscle cells (SMC) in veins. Valvular incompetence and increased hydrostatic pressure have been implicated in the pathogenesis of varicose veins. Alterations in the ECM and varied expression of metalloproteinases and their inhibitors can affect changes in venous wall remodeling. Gene expression and specific candidate markers have been identified in varicose veins. Differential gene transcription may influence the adaptive response of the venous wall to stimuli and the remodeling of the ECM that leads to the development of varicose veins.

### Juleber [^112NSEAn]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The Royal College of General Practitioners discusses the relationship between oral contraceptives and conditions such as venous thrombosis and varicose veins. Studies from the Collaborative Group for the Study of Stroke in Young Women indicate an increased risk of cerebral ischemia or thrombosis related to oral contraception. Petitti and Wingerd's research highlights the combined impact of oral contraceptives and cigarette smoking on the risk of subarachnoid hemorrhage. Inman's findings on oral contraceptives suggest a link with fatal subarachnoid hemorrhage. Additionally, the Collaborative Group highlights risk factors related to strokes in young women who use oral contraceptives. Inman, Vessey, Westerholm, and Engelund's report provides insight into thromboembolic disease and the steroidal content of oral contraceptives. Meade, Greenberg, and Thompson analyze cardiovascular reactions associated with progestogens in oral contraceptives, comparing the safety of 50-mcg and 35-mcg estrogen preparations.

### Varicose remodeling of veins is suppressed by 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors [^112agwWS]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Insufficient venous return may evolve from dysfunctional venous valves, increased body mass index, or pregnancy. Other risk factors for chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) include sex, age, and prolonged standing at work. Even ablation of veins — however insufficient — through stripping, sclerotherapy, radiofrequency ablation, or endovenous laser treatment may restrict overall venous return and often results in the development of varicose recurrences within 5 years after intervention. Although underlying causes may differ, all of the aforementioned conditions ultimately contribute to an increase in intraluminal pressure, namely, venous hypertension, and thus an increase in venous wall stress. This biomechanical stimulus is sufficient to elicit varicose-like remodeling of the venous vessel wall. In line with this effect, lowering venous pressure through collateral bypasses prevents the formation of bulged and tortuous veins. Likewise, surgical techniques referred to as cure conservatrice et hémodynamique de l'insuffisance veineuse en ambulatoire, or CHIVA, correct venous insufficiency by establishing bypasses and avoiding the obstruction of venous drainage wherever possible. This surgical strategy, which indirectly lowers venous wall stress, has been reported to result in a lower rate of recurrences.

### A case report of eosinophilia associated with an etonogestrel implant [^1113un2x]. Contraception (2021). Low credibility.

Progestogen hypersensitivity is a rare adverse effect of endogenous and exogenous progestogens. The etonogestrel implant is very effective for contraception; however, a few cases of progestogen hypersensitivity have been reported. Here, we present a case of delayed-type progestogen hypersensitivity with marked eosinophilia against etonogestrel that resolved after implant removal.

### Toxic epidermal necrolysis caused by etonogestrel implantation: A rare presentation [^111sPRbJ]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Low credibility.

The etonogestrel implant (Nexplanon, Merck & Co. Inc) is a radiopaque, rod-shaped, subdermal implant used for contraception. The implant contains etonogestrel (68 mg), a synthetic progestin, which provides contraception for up to 3 years.

Adverse effects related to implant insertion include pain, irritation, swelling, bruising, paresthesias, scarring, and keloid formation. Injury to the nerves and blood vessels can also occur during implantation and removal. However, there are no documented reports of etonogestrel implant-induced skin sloughing, skin necrosis, or epidermolysis in the literature. In this report, we describe a case of toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) related to recent etonogestrel implantation.

### Etonogestrel implant in adolescents: Evaluation of clinical aspects [^112rMCf8]. Contraception (2011). Low credibility.

This prospective non-comparative observational study evaluated the clinical aspects of adolescents who received an etonogestrel implant within 6 months of delivery. The study population comprised 44 adolescents managed at the Family Planning Sector of São Paulo Federal University. The implant was inserted, on average, 102 days after delivery, and patients were followed for one year. At each monthly visit to the clinic, participants were weighed, had their blood pressure measured, and were asked to report symptoms experienced during the last 30 days.

Approximately one-third (38.6%) of the participants reported symptoms, mostly headaches. There were no complaints of dysmenorrhea, breast tenderness, or lower leg edema throughout the 12 months of follow-up. Mean body weight dropped by 1.2 kg on average, from 56.4 kg at implant insertion to 55.3 kg at the end of the 1-year period. Body mass index also decreased by 0.5 kg/m² on average, although these changes did not reach statistical significance. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure remained unchanged throughout the study period. There were no pregnancies, and none of the participants discontinued the method over 528 women-months.

These findings suggest that the etonogestrel implant is a safe and effective contraceptive method that is well accepted by adolescents following a pregnancy.

### Clinical experience and acceptability of the etonogestrel subdermal contraceptive implant [^113evB8w]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2005). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy, adverse effects, and user continuation rate of an etonogestrel subdermal single-rod contraceptive implant. A total of 417 healthy volunteers of childbearing age were included in this multicenter trial. After implant insertion, the women were followed up during the three years of contraceptive action. At each visit, clinical findings, side effects, and bleeding patterns were recorded. Efficacy and continuation rates were analyzed using the Pearl Index and Kaplan-Meier life tables, respectively.

The observation period totaled 958.5 woman-years (27.5 months per woman). The Pearl Index score was 0. Side effects were reported by 44.4% of users, but the proportion decreased to 16.5% by the end of the study. The continuation rate was 61.4%. The most common reason for early discontinuation (in 21.1% of the participants) was menstrual disturbances.

Etonogestrel subdermal contraceptive implants demonstrated high efficacy and an acceptable continuation rate. Counseling potential users explicitly about the side effects will optimize patient success with this long-acting contraceptive.
