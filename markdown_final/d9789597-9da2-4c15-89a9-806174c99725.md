## Question

Reticulocytes DNA readily taken up meticulous stain reliable source

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether reticulocytes contain DNA that can be readily stained, and which stains and sources are most reliable for detecting reticulocytes. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the fundamental biology of reticulocytes and whether they retain nuclear DNA. Then, I should verify which nucleic acid dyes reliably stain reticulocytes and why. Next, I will examine the best sources of reticulocytes for enrichment and staining. After that, I need to check pre-analytical and staining variables that affect reliability. Finally, I will synthesize a concise, clinically actionable answer with appropriate caveats and references.

> Let me first confirm the biology. Reticulocytes are enucleated red cell precursors that circulate for 1–2 days before becoming mature erythrocytes; they lack a nucleus and therefore do not contain nuclear DNA, but they retain ribosomal RNA and residual organelles that stain with nucleic acid dyes, which is the basis for their detection as "reticulated" cells [^11622pdR] [^116wq1aL].

> Wait, let me verify the nuance about DNA. I initially wondered if any DNA might persist, but hold on, I should verify the lineage-specific DNA signals. Recent work shows that platelets contain megakaryocyte-derived genomic DNA, and erythroblast-derived DNA contributes to cell-free DNA, but that does not imply that enucleated reticulocytes contain nuclear DNA; indeed, flow cytometry studies distinguish DNA+ nucleated precursors from DNA− reticulocytes, confirming that mature reticulocytes are DNA− while still RNA+ [^111WZd6N] [^112dE6tz].

> Next, I should review which stains are "meticulous" and reliable for reticulocyte detection. Thiazole orange is the most consistently validated vital dye for reticulocyte RNA, used in both research and clinical flow cytometry platforms; SYBR Green I and other nucleic acid dyes also detect reticulocyte RNA and have been used to quantify reticulocyte invasion in malaria studies, but thiazole orange remains the reference dye in many hematology workflows [^113ZWifY] [^11622pdR] [^115wuyyR].

> I need to check the best sources for reticulocyte enrichment. Cord blood contains a higher reticulocyte fraction than adult peripheral blood and is a classic source for reticulocyte enrichment; leukocyte depletion and Percoll density gradients can yield reticulocyte-rich fractions exceeding 50% in some protocols, which improves downstream staining and functional assays [^115DRjux] [^115pScg3]. In vitro differentiation of CD34+ progenitors or immortalized erythroid lines (e.g. BEL-A) also produces large quantities of enucleated reticulocytes suitable for flow cytometry and functional studies, with filtration to remove nucleated cells and pyrenocytes [^11622pdR] [^115jWtTc] [^116LJwRx].

> Hold on, I should verify pre-analytical and staining variables that affect reliability. Reticulocytes are more fragile than mature RBCs, so gentle handling, appropriate anticoagulation, and timely processing matter; automated platforms often use oxazine or polymethine nucleic acid dyes with controlled lysis and acquisition parameters to standardize detection, and flow cytometry best practices emphasize viability controls and panel validation to avoid misclassification of debris or nucleated cells as reticulocytes [^116zLF7h] [^114RsA7w] [^116LJwRx].

> Let me synthesize the answer clearly. Reticulocytes do not contain nuclear DNA and therefore cannot be stained for nuclear DNA; however, they retain RNA that is readily detected by nucleic acid dyes, with thiazole orange being the most widely validated and reliable stain for reticulocyte identification by flow cytometry. The most dependable sources for reticulocyte enrichment are cord blood and in vitro–differentiated erythroid cultures, with careful leukodepletion and, when needed, density separation or filtration to purify enucleated reticulocytes for accurate staining and quantification [^112dE6tz] [^113ZWifY] [^115DRjux] [^11622pdR].

Reticulocytes **lack nuclear DNA** but contain residual RNA that is readily stained by nucleic acid dyes [^115Hxbwb]. Thiazole orange (TO) is the **most reliable and widely used stain** for reticulocyte RNA, providing consistent, high-contrast fluorescence for accurate identification and quantification by flow cytometry or microscopy [^113ZWifY] [^115wuyyR]. SYBR Green I and acridine orange are alternatives, but TO remains the **gold standard** due to its specificity and stability [^11622pdR] [^111f9fTT].

## Presence of DNA in reticulocytes

Reticulocytes are **enucleated** and therefore lack nuclear DNA; however, they retain residual RNA that is detectable by nucleic acid stains [^1139Wrzb]. This RNA is the target for **reticulocyte staining**, not DNA.

## Nucleic acid stains for reticulocytes

Several nucleic acid stains are used to detect reticulocytes, including:

| **Stain** | **Mechanism** | **Application** | **Reliability** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Thiazole orange (TO) | Binds RNA | Flow cytometry, microscopy | Highly reliable, gold standard [^114ZoXEN] |
| SYBR Green I | Binds nucleic acids | Flow cytometry | Reliable, but less specific than TO [^11622pdR] |
| Acridine orange | Binds RNA | Microscopy, microfluidics | Reliable, but less specific than TO [^111f9fTT] |

Thiazole orange is the **most reliable and widely used stain** for reticulocytes, providing consistent, high-contrast fluorescence for accurate identification and quantification [^1164vUCo] [^115wuyyR].

## Reliability of thiazole orange staining

Thiazole orange staining is **highly reliable** for reticulocyte detection because of its specificity for RNA, producing a strong fluorescent signal that clearly distinguishes reticulocytes from mature erythrocytes [^116YHQoN]. It is the **gold standard** for reticulocyte staining in clinical and research settings [^notfound].

---

## Sources of reticulocytes for staining

Reticulocytes can be obtained from **various sources**, including:

- **Peripheral blood**: Commonly used for clinical and research purposes [^111vvDNh].
- **Cord blood**: Contains a higher percentage of reticulocytes, useful for research applications [^115DRjux].
- **In vitro cultured reticulocytes**: Generated from hematopoietic stem cells or immortalized erythroid lines, providing a controlled and scalable source [^115jWtTc] [^11622pdR].

---

## Factors influencing the reliability of reticulocyte staining

Several factors influence the **reliability of reticulocyte staining**:

- **Stain concentration and incubation time**: Optimal staining conditions must be determined empirically to ensure consistent results [^114RsA7w].
- **Cell viability**: Dead or damaged cells may nonspecifically bind stains, leading to false positives [^notfound].
- **Sample preparation**: Proper sample handling and processing are critical for accurate staining and quantification [^117CeysB].

---

## Clinical and research applications of reticulocyte staining

Reticulocyte staining has **important clinical and research applications**, including:

- **Diagnosis and monitoring of anemia**: Reticulocyte counts provide information on bone marrow response and erythropoietic activity [^111vvDNh].
- **Evaluation of erythropoietic disorders**: Reticulocyte staining helps assess erythropoietic activity in various hematological conditions [^111vvDNh].
- **Research on erythropoiesis**: Reticulocyte staining is used to study erythroid differentiation, maturation, and related biological processes [^115Hxbwb].

Reticulocytes lack nuclear DNA but contain residual RNA that is readily stained by nucleic acid dyes. Thiazole orange is the **most reliable and widely used stain** for reticulocyte detection, providing consistent, high-contrast fluorescence for accurate identification and quantification [^1164vUCo].

Flow cytometric quantification of reticulocyte invasion

The ability to measure parasitemia and calculate invasion efficiency using dyes that stain nucleic acids combined with flow cytometry provides a rapid and high-throughput alternative to manual counting of Giemsa-stained smears or cytospins. As application of nucleic acid dyes for this purpose is reliant upon the absence of DNA in uninfected red blood cells, use of nucleated erythroid cells as a model for invasion precludes their use. In vitro differentiation of primary CD34 + cell-derived erythroblasts or BEL-A cells generate enucleated reticulocytes that can be purified by leukofiltration, which removes nucleated precursors and extruded pyrenocytes. To determine whether flow cytometry could be used to measure invasion efficiency in BEL-A-derived reticulocytes, target cells incubated with schizonts for 16 h were stained with SYBR green for 20 min and analyzed by flow cytometry. Although background staining of reticulocytes (derived from either CD34 + or BEL-A cells) is greater than that of erythrocytes (attributable to SYBR green staining of reticulocyte RNA), invaded reticulocytes could be distinguished, and invasion efficiency quantified at different multiplicities of infection for single and multiply invaded cells using this approach (Fig. 2, Supplementary Fig. 2). Flow cytometry yielded values comparable to manual counting for the PMR and selectivity index (Supplementary Fig. 3).

### Cell-free DNA testing: future applications in gastroenterology and hepatology [^1154Eucd]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Current problems

There are several technical challenges that must be overcome before cfDNA testing becomes widespread. First, there is no standard method of collecting circulating cfDNA, and the method of collection can have a major impact on whether there is cellular lysis resulting in dilution of cfDNA. Several studies have shown that lysis of immature red blood cells (reticulocytes) is a large source of dilution of cfDNA. Though most studies of cfDNA use plasma, others use serum. In addition, there are no standard conditions for the collection and storage of cfDNA samples, although commercial tubes exist that are geared towards reducing cell lysis for the purpose of cfDNA collection (Streck TM tubes). In addition, if not stored appropriately, for instance, without EDTA, endonucleases will rapidly degrade cfDNA. If cfDNA is purified, care must be taken that purification is not biased to certain types of fragments (i.e. larger fragments) when quantitative analysis follows.

In addition to these preanalytical issues with collection, processing, and storage, there are no standard protocols with regards to the analysis of cfDNA. As this technology matures, third-party validation of testing parameters must be taken into account such as the sensitivity, reliability, use of internal and external controls, and regulatory guidance from the FDA as well as laboratory regulatory bodies will be required. These challenges will also have to be balanced with the cost and clinical utility of performing cfDNA testing.

Other inherent problems with cfDNA include the small and fragmented nature, which makes analysis more difficult, and nearly impossible for the detection of mutations such as balanced chromosomal rearrangements.

### Newly formed reticulated platelets undermine pharmacokinetically short-lived antiplatelet therapies [^114ZoXEN]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2017). Low credibility.

As well as modeling these interactions with regard to standard tests of platelet reactivity, our imaging techniques demonstrated that exogenously added uninhibited platelets were clustered at the cores of aggregates formed in response to ADP in samples from volunteers receiving aspirin+clopidogrel, consistent with their ability to act as seeds for aggregate formation. As hypothesized previously, the longer half-life and reversible binding of ticagrelor, in contrast to the irreversible binding of prasugrel, means it is present and able to act on the exogenous drug-free, uninhibited, platelet subpopulation. It can be noted that ticagrelor might in addition act pleiotropically on adenosine uptake to influence platelet function, but we did not test this possibility. It was notable that the recovery of the response to AA caused by the addition of exogenous drug-free platelets was blunted in samples prepared from individuals receiving aspirin+ticagrelor compared with those receiving aspirin+prasugrel. This is consistent with P2Y 12 blockade reducing the amplifying effects of thromboxane A2 produced in response to AA – and confirmed our in vitro observation that circulating ticagrelor, unlike prasugrel, may provide additional compensation for the loss of cyclooxygenase-1 inhibition noted in individuals with elevated platelet turnover.

In our in vitro and ex vivo models, we stained or labeled uninhibited platelets to allow determination of their function as a subpopulation. Examination of the definitive drug-free population in patients is less straightforward. Newly formed immature platelets are also called reticulated platelets because of the presence of residual cytosolic mRNA. Dyes such as thiazole orange, which stain nucleic acids, are routinely used for determining the percentage of reticulocytes (including platelets) in blood samples. Accepting that the emergence of a drug-free platelet subpopulation occurs as a result of platelet turnover and the associated release of newly formed platelets, analyses of newly formed platelets in samples can be used to inform on the behavior of drug-free platelets. We have demonstrated under our particular conditions that thiazole orange staining of PRP identifies those platelets with the highest mRNA content. We therefore utilized this approach to track newly formed platelets during aggregate formation. In samples from healthy volunteers not taking antiplatelet drugs, reticulated platelets were overproportionally recruited to the formation of aggregates, indicating that under normal physiological conditions, they are important drivers of the aggregation process. This finding concurs with previous reports by ourselves, and others, that newly formed reticulated platelets possess inherently greater reactivity and have a greater propensity for recruitment to thrombi.

Results

Concentration of human reticulocytes

Relatively modest reticulocyte enrichment was considered to be an important impediment to efficient invasion rates. Therefore, we opted for cord blood as a source of reticulocytes because it contains a significantly higher percentage of immature RBCs than peripheral blood. We considered it important to deplete leukocytes to minimize phagocytosis of merozoite or IRBCs during the assay. This depletion, achieved using CF11 filtration, was best carried out before Percoll enrichment. It was necessary to perform 2 rounds of CF11 filtration to bring lymphocyte contamination to undetectable levels. We then optimized Percoll gradients for the enrichment of reticulocytes from the leukocyte-depleted cord blood. Using the new methylene blue stain (Sigma-Aldrich) to identify reticulocytes, we established that optimal reticulocyte enrichment is obtained on a 70% Percoll cushion. A mean of 57.8% reticulocytes (95% confidence interval [CI]: 51.1%-64.5%) was routinely obtained from cord blood that initially contained an average of 4.6% (95% CI: 3.9%-5.2%) reticulocytes (Figure 1). Generally, 20 mL of whole cord blood yielded a mean 191 μL (95% CI: 152 μL-230 μL; n = 28) of packed reticulocyte-enriched blood.

### Improved light microscopy counting method for accurately counting plasmodium parasitemia and reticulocytemia [^111Exhnc]. American Journal of Hematology (2016). Low credibility.

Even with the advances in molecular or automated methods for detection of red blood cells of interest (such as reticulocytes or parasitized cells), light microscopy continues to be the gold standard especially in laboratories with limited resources. The conventional method for determination of parasitemia and reticulocytemia uses a Miller reticle, a grid with squares of different sizes. However, this method is prone to errors if not used correctly and counts become inaccurate and highly time-consuming at low frequencies of target cells. In this report, we outline the correct guidelines to follow when using a reticle for counting, and present a new counting protocol that is a modified version of the conventional method for increased accuracy in the counting of low parasitemias and reticulocytemias.

Initial evaluation — Clinical history should include the timing, severity, and tempo of abnormal cytopenias; prior infections or bleeding episodes; and number of transfusions, and cytopenias are defined as values lower than standard laboratory hematologic levels. In addition to establishing current blood and reticulocyte counts, clinicians need a peripheral blood smear evaluation to determine the degree of dysplasia. Bone marrow aspiration with Prussian blue stain for iron and a biopsy are needed, and cytogenetics for bone marrow samples should be obtained; if standard cytogenetics with 20 or more metaphases cannot be obtained, chromosome microarray analysis (CMA)/ chromosome genomic array testing (CGAT) or MDS-related FISH panel should be performed, and if karyotype is normal, the CMA should be considered; however, CMAs detect both somatic and germline or constitutional changes. Bone marrow biopsy staining for reticulin is recommended, increased reticulin fibers in the marrow at diagnosis are seen in approximately 5% to 10% of MDS cases, and MDS with fibrosis is considered a distinct subtype of MDS in the 2022 WHO classification. Because MDS are relatively indolent disorders, blood count stability is used to distinguish MDS from evolving AML, and other possible causes of cytopenias require careful evaluation.

### Reticulocyte analysis by flow cytometry and other techniques [^111vvDNh]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

Enumeration of peripheral blood reticulocytes is an essential part of the diagnosis and management of anemic patients, since the number of reticulocytes in the peripheral blood reflects the erythrocytic activity of the bone marrow. Reticulocyte enumeration using flow cytometric methodology is rapidly replacing the inaccurate, imprecise manual counting technique used in the past. This article explores the pathophysiology of the reticulocyte, the various means of counting reticulocytes, and the diverse clinical applications of reticulocyte data.

Methods

Samples and pathology review

Figure 1 A shows the path of a case through the diagnosis process for the National MDS Study. Clinic sites submit unstained slides of diagnostic bone marrow aspirates and biopsies and peripheral blood samples to the central lab along with a report containing the diagnosis determined by the pathologist at the local site, using the World Health Organization (WHO) 2016 classification. Of note, the central and tertiary reviewers (board-certified hematopathologists) practice in tertiary referral academic practices, whereas local pathology review is a blend of academic and community practitioners. Supplemental Table 1 provides an additional description of the type of data that were available to pathologists. The pathologists did not have consistent access to the centrally performed targeted exon sequencing results generated by the study. However, if genetic testing was performed at the local site, these results were shared with all pathologists.

(A) Cord blood at collection contains a mixture of normocytes, reticulocytes, and leukocytes. (B) After 2 rounds of leukocyte depletion on a CF-11 cellulose column, reticulocytes form the majority of the cells present in the band (seen at the 5.5-mL mark on the tube pictured in panel C) obtained by enrichment on a 70% Percoll cushion. (D) Thin smear showing mature trophozoites (black arrows) and leukocytes typically observed from P vivax isolates collected from patients. (E) Typical yield of concentrated mature P vivax parasites obtained on a 45% Percoll cushion (from a band similar to the one depicted in panel C after a single round of leukocyte depletion on CF-11 and 20 hours ex vivo maturation). (F) The concentrated reticulocyte target cells (B) and mature P vivax schizonts (E) are mixed at a ratio of 6:1 for the invasion assay. (G) After culturing for ∼ 24 hours, the invasion assay mixture shows remnants of ruptured schizonts (*), and RBCs newly invaded by one (black arrow) or multiple merozoites (orange arrowhead). Black scale bar on the micrographs corresponds to 10 μm.

Concentration of mature P vivax IRBCs

The IRBC levels in the peripheral blood samples collected from P vivax –infected patients rarely exceed 50 000/μL. Moreover, the circulating parasites are often at different developmental stages of their 48-hour erythrocytic cycle. Thus, an ex vivo maturation step before enrichment is needed to increase the proportion of mature schizonts. A total of 98 isolates were collected from malaria patients with microscopically confirmed P vivax at several SMRU clinics on the Thai-Myanmar border. The mean parasitemia observed in these samples was 0.41% (95% CI: 0.36%-0.44%). The samples were processed for the invasion assay within 6 hours after collection. A single round of leukocyte depletion on CF11 columns was carried out before initiating the ex vivo maturation step. Eighty-five isolates of the 98 collected were successfully cultured to late schizogony, the remaining failed to mature or became contaminated. We then established that a 45% Percoll cushion best concentrated the mature parasites.

Reticulated Platelets Are More Reactive Than Older Platelets and Locate to the Core of Aggregates

To monitor the reactivity of newly formed platelets, also called reticulated platelets because of the presence of mRNA, platelets were labeled ex vivo with the nucleic dye, thiazole orange. We devised a gating strategy (Figure IV in the) to determine the proportional usage of these newly formed platelets relative to older nonreticulated plateletsduring aggregate formation. Using PRP from untreated healthy volunteers stimulated by AA (1 mmol/L) or ADP (20 μmol/L) until 40% of platelets were aggregated the relative composition of the nonaggregated platelet population was assessed by flow cytometry. After aggregation, there was a significant reduction in the relative proportion of reticulated platelets indicating that reticulated platelets contributed overproportionately to aggregate formation (Figure 4 A and 4 B). Subsequent examination of formed aggregates by flow cytometric imaging confirmed the presence of reticulated platelets in the majority of aggregates (Figure 4 C).

### A reliable ex vivo invasion assay of human reticulocytes by plasmodium vivax [^112huyYW]. Blood (2011). Low credibility.

Ex vivo invasion assay

For the invasion assay, enriched reticulocytes and mature P vivax schizonts were incubated together for 24 hours, and newly infected RBCs were determined by microscopy. Only ring and early trophozoites were enumerated because these forms alone were considered to result from invasion events that occurred during the incubation. Any mature schizonts, gametocytes, degenerate parasites, or forms with evidence of nuclear division that were occasionally observed were excluded when calculating invasion efficiency.

At present a standard volume of 300 μL of medium with 1.4% hematocrit was used for Plasmodium invasion assays, principally because it would have been difficult to obtain thin smears of sufficient quality to enumerate parasites at a lower volume or hematocrit. In preliminary experiments, the invasion efficiency decreased when the number of host cells per parasite increased above 6 (data not shown). Therefore, a maximum of 6 invasion assays could be undertaken from the enriched parasite fraction (4.5 μL) originating from the 5 mL of blood sample collected from each patient. On average, a total of 55 assays are possible from the enriched reticulocyte fraction (191 μL) originating from each 20-mL cord blood sample.

Successful invasion assays were conducted for the parasites enriched from 85 patients. Invasion efficiency was expressed as the percentage of RBCs with rings/trophozoites (ie, newly invaded cells) per 4000 target host cells following the 24-hour incubation. The invasion efficiencies observed were highly variable, from 0.1% to 22.3%, with a mean of 3.7% (95% CI: 2.8%-4.6%; Figure 3). Such variability may be because of one or several factors related to either reticulocyte-enriched fraction (target cell), or the schizont-enriched P vivax inoculum, or to both. Despite this variability, 83% (71 of 85) of the isolates were equal to or above the "quantitation limit" threshold of 0.5% (Figure 3 A) and would have proven to be useful in invasion assays.

Reticulocyte filtration and storage

At the end of the procedure, large-scale erythroid cultures need to be volume reduced and filtered to separate the mRBC from the nucleated cells and expelled nuclei (also known as pyrenocytes). Currently, the filters used are dead-end leukoreduction filters routinely used by blood banks. These have been designed to filter whole blood, which typically consists of ~ 5x10 9 RBC and only ~5x10 6 nucleated cells per milliliter of blood. In comparison, the percentage enucleation for mRBC cultures is approximately 80% and the medium contains pyrenocytes as well as free DNA released by disintegrated nuclei. It is notable that very few studies on mRBC yield test the filterability of their final product or report the yield after filtration. This is a key parameter as the mRBC must be purified before clinical use and this process currently alters the yield by 30–50%. Strategies and more research are needed to improve reticulocyte recovery after filtration, which will lead to a dramatic increase in yield. There are open-ended filter technologies, such as tangential flow filtration systems or acoustic resonance cell filtration, which could potentially be used but are as yet untested. More experimental approaches include lab-on-a-chip microfluidic label-free reticulocyte-sorting methods. All these possibilities need testing and optimizing on a large culture scale which is expensive, therefore, highlighting filtration as a key area of research calling for innovation as well as commercial investment and collaboration.

Once filtered, the mRBC need to be stored whilst quality control tests are carried out and until they can be transfused into a patient. As reticulocytes, mRBC are more fragile than RBC and more optimal storage conditions need to be developed. An alternative approach is to promote maturation of cultured reticulocytes into bona fide erythrocytes, which is another area of active research.

### An immortalized adult human erythroid line facilitates sustainable and scalable generation of functional red cells [^115jWtTc]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

With increasing worldwide demand for safe blood, there is much interest in generating red blood cells in vitro as an alternative clinical product. However, available methods for in vitro generation of red cells from adult and cord blood progenitors do not yet provide a sustainable supply, and current systems using pluripotent stem cells as progenitors do not generate viable red cells. We have taken an alternative approach, immortalizing early adult erythroblasts generating a stable line, which provides a continuous supply of red cells. The immortalized cells differentiate efficiently into mature, functional reticulocytes that can be isolated by filtration. Extensive characterization has not revealed any differences between these reticulocytes and in vitro-cultured adult reticulocytes functionally or at the molecular level, and importantly no aberrant protein expression. We demonstrate a feasible approach to the manufacture of red cells for clinical use from in vitro culture.

### Megakaryocyte-and erythroblast-specific cell-free DNA patterns in plasma and platelets reflect thrombopoiesis and erythropoiesis levels [^11749ZE9]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

In this study, we identify definitive methylation markers that distinguish megakaryocytes and erythroblasts and use these to characterize the presence of DNA from megakaryocytes and erythroblasts in plasma of healthy individuals and in different pathological scenarios which affect the production of platelets and red blood cells. We find that measuring megakaryocyte and erythroblast cfDNA allows the detection and distinction of pathologies affecting these lineages, even when not reflected in peripheral blood cell counts. Furthermore, we discover that platelets, not previously believed to contain genomic DNA, do in fact contain genomic DNA originating in megakaryocytes, despite the lack of a nucleus.

### Clinical utility of the reticulocyte hemoglobin content in the diagnosis of iron deficiency [^111svRYK]. Blood (2002). Low credibility.

Determination of the reticulocyte hemoglobin content (CHr) provides an early measure of functional iron deficiency because reticulocytes are the earliest erythrocytes released into blood and circulate for only 1 to 2 days. The CHr in 78 patients undergoing bone marrow examination was measured to assess its clinical utility for the diagnosis of iron deficiency. Twenty-eight patients were iron deficient, based on the lack of stainable iron in the aspirate. The diagnostic power of CHr is limited in patients with high mean cellular volume (MCV) or red cell disorders such as thalassemia. However, when patients with MCV more than 100 fL are excluded, receiver operator curve analysis of CHr, ferritin, transferrin saturation, and MCV demonstrates that CHr has the highest overall sensitivity and specificity of these peripheral blood tests for predicting the absence of bone marrow iron stores.

### Plasmodium vivax infection compromises reticulocyte stability [^112dE6tz]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

The lysis 50 values obtained for RBC precursors and reticulocytes from bone marrow aspirates revealed that nucleated RBC precursors (DNA+ CD71+) were the most osmotically stable (Lysis 50 70.1 ± 5.8) followed by the youngest CD71+ RNA+ DNA− reticulocytes (Lysis 50 87.3 ± 8.0), older CD71− RNA+ DNA− reticulocytes (Lysis 50 107.4 ± 7.3) and CD71− RNA− DNA− normocytes (Lysis 50 114.5 ± 5.4) (Fig. 2b and c). To establish osmotic stability dynamics during erythropoiesis, we assessed the osmotic stability of erythroid progenitors differentiated in vitro from CD34+ stem cells. This study revealed a strong trend of decreasing osmotic stability as cells progressed in vitro from majority basophilic and polychromatic normoblasts at day 9 (Lysis 50 73.8 ± 3.6) to a majority polychromatic and orthochromatic normoblast population at day 11 (Lysis 50 102.7 ± 15.6), and then further decreased as cells progressed through final orthochromatic normoblast maturation occurring between day 14 (Lysis 50 102.2 ± 2.0) day 17 (Lysis 50 126.2 ± 11.2), and day 20 (Lysis 50 143.4 ± 15.1) (Fig. 2d). Parallel examination of the osmotic stability of CD71+ reticulocytes differentiated in vitro showed no significant difference in osmotic stability as a function of day reticulocytes were sampled (Supplementary Fig. 2D). Furthermore, consistent with a previous study, CD71+ reticulocytes generated in vitro (Lysis 50 110.1 ± 3.7) were less stable than CD71+ reticulocytes from bone marrow samples (Lysis 50 87.3 ± 8.0) (Supplementary Fig. 2E). Together these results demonstrate the capacity of flow cytometry to assess the osmotic stability of discrete RBC subsets within heterogeneous populations and clearly shows that erythroid development and reticulocyte maturation are associated with significant changes in osmotic stability.

Automatic platelet counting techniques

Impedance platelet counting

The principle of this method is based on the property of blood cells in electrolyte solutions to increase the impedance of the current, when passing through a small aperture between two electrodes, which is proportional to the volume of the cell. The first instruments required platelets to be counted in platelet-rich plasma, but more recent, technologically advanced impedance-based hematology analyzers allow platelet counting in whole blood samples. All particles with volumes within a predefined range are counted as platelets, while particles outside that range are not counted, independently of whether they are or are not platelets. Therefore, the resulting platelet count may be overestimated (due to the inclusion of non-platelet particles in the final count, such as cell debris, immune complexes, bacteria, microcytic red blood cells) or underestimated (due to the presence of very large platelets, platelet clumps or platelet adhering to leukocytes).

Optical platelet counting

Optical light scatter methods have been implemented for platelet counting. One-dimensional and two-dimensional platelet analysis instruments are available. In the two-dimensional analysis, detectors for low- and high-angle scattered light allow measurements of the platelet size and density, respectively, which facilitate the distinction between platelet and red blood cell populations. The two-dimensional counting appears to provide more accurate results in thrombocytopenic samples because, if the number of particles is too low, the data acquisition time is automatically extended, thus increasing the number of events counted.

Table 1.
Accuracy and precision of six platelet counting methods.

Hybrid platelet counting

Hybrid platelet counting combines the detection of small platelets (< 10 fL) by an impedance channel (which is distinct from the red blood cell detection channel) with the detection of large platelets (> 10 fL) by the white blood cell differential channel, to obtain accurate platelet counting.

Optical fluorescence platelet counting

A fluorescent dye (oxazine) is used to stain mitochondrial DNA and ribosomal RNA, thus increasing the difference in fluorescence intensity between platelets and fragmented red cells, enhancing specificity. The platelet count is measured in the reticulated red channel of automated hematology analyzers. The parallel analysis of fluorescence and scattered light increases the accuracy of platelet counting, especially because it allows better discrimination between large platelets and small red blood cells.

### Flow cytometric sorting of infected erythrocytes demonstrates reliable detection of individual ring-stage plasmodium falciparum parasites by plasmodium 18S rRNA reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction [^112JpTKE]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2022). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT.

Molecular diagnostic tests for Plasmodium falciparum parasites are increasingly used to enable ultrasensitive detection of infection in clinical trials and field surveillance studies. Ribonucleic acid (RNA)-based assays targeting 18S rRNA are particularly sensitive with limits of detection reported to comprise a single infected red blood cell (RBC) in a relatively large volume of blood. However, the validation testing at such limiting concentrations is hampered by the so-called Poisson distribution of such rare events, which can lead laboratorians to inaccurately set the limit of detection higher (i.e. less sensitive) than the assay can actually detect. Here we set out to formally demonstrate the analytical sensitivity of the Plasmodium 18S rRNA quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR). Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) was used on synchronous P. falciparum cultures doubly stained for DNA and RNA and was followed by qRT-PCR on the individual sorted cells spiked with negative whole blood. Over 95% of individual single-ring infected RBCs were detected by qRT-PCR. The formally measured median 18S rRNA content per individual ring-stage P. falciparum parasite was 9,550 copies (interquartile range 8,130–12,300). Thus, one can confidently rely on Plasmodium 18S rRNA qRT-PCR to detect one parasite per 50-µL blood sample.

### A flow cytometry-based assay for measuring invasion of red blood cells by plasmodium falciparum [^1163s8pD]. American Journal of Hematology (2010). Low credibility.

Variability in the ability of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum to invade human erythrocytes is postulated to be an important determinant of disease severity. Both the parasite multiplication rate and erythrocyte selectivity are important parameters that underlie such variable invasion. We have established a flow cytometry-based method for simultaneously calculating both the parasitemia and the number of multiply-infected erythrocytes. Staining with the DNA-specific dye SYBR Green I allows quantitation of parasite invasion at the ring stage of parasite development. We discuss in vitro and in vivo applications and limitations of this method in relation to the study of parasite invasion.

Data collection tools

Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) test

The real-time PCR method was used for the detection of the JAK2 (V617F) mutation for the diagnosis of PV. JAK2 exon 12 mutation analysis was performed in addition to the JAK2 V617F mutation. In this way, a second analysis was performed in the diagnosis of PV for those who were not positive for the JAK2 V617F mutation (n = 254). However, the JAK2 exon 12 mutation test performed on all of these patients was negative. In this process, a peripheral blood sample was carefully taken from the patient and prepared for mutation analysis. DNA was first isolated from a blood sample. This process was performed by standard phenol-chloroform extraction. The quality and concentration of the obtained DNA sample were confirmed by spectrophotometric methods. Commercial kits containing specific primers and probes for JAK2 V617F and exon 12 mutations were used. Real-time PCR analysis targeted the V617F mutation in the JAK2 gene using specific primers and probes. The PCR mixture was prepared with isolated DNA, a specific primer/probe set and a Taq DNA polymerase enzyme. This reaction was performed in a thermocycle device. A fluorescent signal was generated during amplification and the presence of the mutation was analysed. During the analysis process, the signal exceeding the Ct value indicated that the mutation was positive. These data were analysed in the software of the real-time PCR device, and the final result was obtained.

Bone marrow biopsy

Another method frequently used in the diagnosis of PV disease is bone marrow biopsy. This analysis is an important method to evaluate the haematopoietic activity of the patient and to confirm myeloproliferative diseases. In this procedure, bone marrow samples were obtained from the posterior iliac crest of the patients under local anaesthesia. A fine biopsy needle was used during the procedure and both bone marrow aspiration and bone marrow biopsy were obtained. During aspiration, a liquid bone marrow sample was obtained and examined under a microscope using the Wright-Giemsa staining method. A bone marrow biopsy was performed by providing a solid tissue sample and histopathological evaluation of the cellular structure. The biopsy material obtained was fixed and then processed into paraffin blocks. Thin sections taken from these blocks were examined using reticulin staining and H&E staining. During the examination, proliferation of erythroid, myeloid and megakaryocyte cell lines was evaluated. Hyperplasia and megakaryocyte clusters, which are typical of PV patients, were observed.

### How to approach chronic anemia [^116116vp]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2012). Low credibility.

We present herein an approach to diagnosing the cause of chronic anemia based on a patient's history and complete blood cell count (CBC). Four patterns that are encountered frequently in CBCs associated with chronic anemias are considered: (1) anemia with abnormal platelet and/or leukocyte counts, (2) anemia with increased reticulocyte counts, (3) life-long history of chronic anemia, and (4) anemia with inappropriately low reticulocytes. The pathophysiologic bases for some chronic anemias with low reticulocyte production are reviewed in terms of the bone marrow (BM) events that reduce normal rates of erythropoiesis. These events include: apoptosis of erythroid progenitor and precursor cells by intrinsic and extrinsic factors, development of macrocytosis when erythroblast DNA replication is impaired, and development of microcytosis due to heme-regulated eIF2α kinase inhibition of protein synthesis in iron-deficient or thalassemic erythroblasts.

The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2022). Medium credibility.

Despite a wealth of data based on hand-diluted standard curves of parasite-containing samples, the possibility remained that fractionated parasites or extracellular parasite 18S rRNAs were contributing to the ultrasensitive performance. In addition, the production of high-quality parasite standard curves were dependent on having extremely synchronous parasite cultures, and even highly synchronous cultures nonetheless result in variable standard curves because of problems of limiting sample statistics. Here, the Poisson distribution describes the likelihood that a certain number of infected red blood cells (herein named iRBC) will be present in a specific sample volume when prepared from a reliably quantified stock. In most molecular assays, a claim of single organism detection implies single copy detection, but that is not the case for P. falciparum 18S rRNA qRT-PCR since each parasitized RBC contains thousands of copies of mature 18S rRNA. Despite the abundant target within individual infected cells, sampling bias can affect the perceived analytical detection. At a nominal (average rate of occurrence) concentration of one iRBC per sample, the Poisson distribution predicts that 36.8% of 100 such samples would actually contain zero iRBCs, 36.8% would contain one iRBC, 18.4% would contain two iRBCs, 6.1% would contain three, and so on (Figure 1). This distribution would skew to the right by several factors including inaccurately quantified higher-density samples, and the presence of multiply infected rings as is common in P. falciparum culture.

Figure 1.
Theoretical outcome of repeated sampling to obtain single infected red blood cells (iRBCs) by standard pipetting vs. fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) for individual iRBCs. Parasite standard curves are usually prepared by repeated dilution into uninfected whole blood (left). When diluted as shown, the final dilution at 20 parasites/mL blood corresponds to an average of one infected RBC (iRBC) per 50-µL of sampled whole blood. However, actual distribution is best described by Poisson distribution such that some volumetrically pipetted samples will contain zero iRBCs (37% of the time), some will contain a single iRBC as intended (37% of the time), and the remainder will contain two or more iRBCs as shown in the upper right. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting-based preparation of iRBC-containing samples using DNA and RNA staining (lower right) can overcome this sampling bias to prepare a reliable panel of samples at the theoretical limit of detection.

RESULTS

Visualization of infected RBCs using IFC.

Plasmodium falciparum cultures usually contain a mixed population of iRBCs consisting of single and multiple rings, trophozoites, and schizonts (Supplemental Figure 1). Lower frequencies of trophozoites and schizonts were seen in synchronized ring cultures. To sort and visualize iRBC from synchronized cultures, the culture was stained with HO and TO to mark DNA-enriched RBC nuclei and rRNA-enriched cytoplasm, respectively. Both are indicative of iRBCs. This stained material was then assessed by IFC as described. Infected red blood cells containing single ring stage parasites or more mature stages were gated on DNA and RNA content and sorted from uRBCs (Figure 2A). Imaging flow cytometry bright-field images of what were expected to be single-ring iRBCs clearly showed one individual ring stage parasite per iRBC. Fluorescence images showed co-localization of HO (DNA) and TO (RNA) within each ring (Figure 2B, for example cells #3729 and #3784 as shown). The intensity and area of the HO- and TO-stained fluorescence in such ring stage iRBCs were lower than in more mature or multiply infected iRBCs (Figure 2B).

Erythroblast abnormalities

Characterisation of the cellular abnormalities in CDA‐I erythroblasts could shed light on the function of the two genes involved. Analysis of cell cycle distribution in cultured erythroblasts showed an increase in cells in S‐phase in CDA‐I, which are, paradoxically, not actively synthesising DNA when tested, suggesting an S‐phase arrest in CDA‐I (Wickramasinghe & Pippard, 1986). This points to a problem with DNA replication, but needs to be refined using a larger number of patients. Unrepaired DNA lesions act as physical barriers to replication fork progression and nicks, gaps and stretches of ssDNA can be both sources and symptoms of stress (Zeman & Cimprich, 2014). Because C15orf41 is predicted to be an endonuclease it may be that there are more unrepaired lesions in CDA‐I patients and therefore more stalled replication forks, underlying the proposed S‐phase arrest. Alternatively, replication intermediaries that are usually cleared by C15orf41 may underlie some of the nuclear abnormalities seen in CDA‐I erythroblasts. Given that these events are stochastic and would also be likely to be affected by genetic background, this may go some way to explaining the variability between patients. It would be very informative to distinguish these possibilities (blocked replication vs. unresolved replication intermediates).

Elucidating the nature of the electron‐lucent areas in the heterochromatin seen by SEM (Fig 3) would shed light on the underlying pathology of CDA‐I, especially as resolving this abnormality is associated with improved Hb levels in patients treated with IFNa (Lavabre‐Bertrand et al, 1995, 2004). The differentiating stain used in SEM is osmium tetroxide, however, why this differentially binds the heterochromatin in affected nuclei is unclear. It may be that the "holes" contain protein, lipids or improperly packaged heterochromatin affecting its transcriptional status.

Do the mutations in either CDAN1 or C15orf41 represent different entities? It has been suggested that CDA‐I arising from mutations of C15orf41 may be more severe (Gambale et al, 2016). In our clinical and laboratory experience, at the time of writing there are insufficient data to draw this distinction with certainty. Given that CDA‐I with specific chromatin abnormalities arises from mutation of either gene, we propose that this disease simply be termed CDA‐I until new insights on genotype/phenotype correlations are obtained.

### Stem cell factor and erythropoietin-independent production of cultured reticulocytes [^111NtC9U]. Haematologica (2024). Medium credibility.

In order to further examine the viability, we stained A4 and H5 kitJak2 SRE with Annexin V-FITC and DAPI and monitored apoptosis by FACS from days 3 to 11 (Figures 5E; Online Supplementary Figures S11D, S12). This analysis revealed that the proportion of Annexin V-positive apoptotic cells ranged from 11% to 16% between days 3 and 9, confirming the cells' high viability during differentiation. At day 11, the percentages of apoptotic cells were significantly higher and more variable across experiments, aligning with the results obtained with propidium iodide staining.

Staining with Draq5 and FACS analysis showed that the rate of enucleation varied from 30% to 55% averaging about 30% for the A4 lines and more than 50% for the H5 SRE (Figure 5F). On average, cell amplification during terminal differentiation, based on more than ten experiments, exceeded a 30-fold increase for the A4 line and reached about 28-fold for the H5 line. This resulted in a yield of more than ten reticulocytes per A4 or H5 SRE plated on day 0 (Figure 5F). Determining the optimal day for harvesting the cRetic proved challenging, because the rate of enucleation tended to increase between day 9 and 11, but in some experiments the viability of the cells decreased dramatically at either day 10 or 11. Additional experiments revealed that both the A4 and all kitjak2 SRE that we generated could differentiate into cRetic up to the point of senescence (Online Supplementary Figure S13).

Characterization of the cultured reticulocytes derived from the A4 and kitjak2 cells

In order to evaluate the quality of the RBC originating from the A4 and the kitjak2 SRE, we purified enucleated cells using PALL Acrodisc filters. We then generated HPLC globin profiles and gathered morphological data via light microscopy, and red cell indices with the Advia 2120 blood count analyzer. The purified RBC expressed 78–82% fetal (Ag and Gg), 12–17% embryonic (ε) and 5–7% adult (b) b-like globins. They also expressed trace amounts of embryonic (z) a-like globins (Figure 5G). Morphologically the cells were larger than standard adult RBC (mean corpuscular volume [MCV] of about 125 fL vs. 85 fL, and diameter of about 10.5 um vs. 8.3 um) and were well hemoglobinized since they exhibited hemoglobin concentrations similar to control cells (about 28 g/dL) (Figure 5H).

Infected erythrocytes were enriched using a KCl-Percoll density gradientand then transferred into culture in supplemented IMDM medium (Gibco) (with 0.5% Albumax II (Gibco), 2.5% heat-inactivated human serum, 25 mM HEPES (Gibco), 20 μg/ml gentamicin (Sigma) and 0.2 mM hypoxanthine (C-C Pro)). The stage of the parasite culture was then assessed via thick blood smears. Parasites were cultured until most reached the schizont stages (~24–45 h, depending on their initial stage). The enriched schizonts were mixed 1:1 with reticulocytes (previously enriched from cord or adult peripheral blood from malaria-naive donors) and pre-labelled with Celltrace Far Red Dye. The cultures were incubated for ~10 h in the presence of test antibodies and the mouse monoclonal anti-Duffy 2C3or, in a few experiments, heparin, was used as positive invasion inhibition control. Cells were stained with DNA stain Hoechst 33342 post-invasion and parasitemia was quantified by flow cytometry. Reticulocytes, which were Hoechst 3342 and Far-Red positive, were scored as new invasion events (Supplementary Figure S1). For quantification, data were normalized against invasion without antibodies and analyzed with FlowJo (V10.8.1) software. Invasion of reticulocytes in the absence of antibodies ranged from 0.4% to 13.8%. Antibodies used in this study were either purchased from commercial supplier (anti-TfR1 OKT9) or generated as previously described.

To determine the enzymatic sensitivity of the invasion of P. vivax isolates, the invasion was performed as described above using reticulocytes pre-treated with either trypsin (1 mg/ml), chymotrypsin (1 mg/ml) or neuraminidase (100 mU/mL) for 1 h at 37 °C. Invasion rates were compared to mock-treated reticulocytes. Of note, all enzymatic treatments did not affect reticulocyte viability since the number of cells stained with Thiazole orange (a specific reticulocyte stain) remained constant over at least 40 h post-treatment (data not shown).

### Megakaryocyte-and erythroblast-specific cell-free DNA patterns in plasma and platelets reflect thrombopoiesis and erythropoiesis levels [^111WZd6N]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) fragments are a biological analyte with extensive utility in diagnostic medicine. Understanding the source of cfDNA and mechanisms of release is crucial for designing and interpreting cfDNA-based liquid biopsy assays. Using cell type-specific methylation markers as well as genome-wide methylation analysis, we determine that megakaryocytes, the precursors of anuclear platelets, are major contributors to cfDNA (~26%), while erythroblasts contribute 1–4% of cfDNA in healthy individuals. Surprisingly, we discover that platelets contain genomic DNA fragments originating in megakaryocytes, contrary to the general understanding that platelets lack genomic DNA. Megakaryocyte-derived cfDNA is increased in pathologies involving increased platelet production (Essential Thrombocythemia, Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura) and decreased upon reduced platelet production due to chemotherapy-induced bone marrow suppression. Similarly, erythroblast cfDNA is reflective of erythrocyte production and is elevated in patients with thalassemia. Megakaryocyte- and erythroblast-specific DNA methylation patterns can thus serve as biomarkers for pathologies involving increased or decreased thrombopoiesis and erythropoiesis, which can aid in determining the etiology of aberrant levels of erythrocytes and platelets.

Flow cytometry

For the described flow cytometry experiments, 1 × 10 7 cells were washed with flow buffer prior to staining with combinations of the following fluorophores: Thiazole Orange, 1:1000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific), Vybrant DyeCycle Violet, 1:5000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific), Vybrant DyeCycle Green, 1:5000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific), propidium iodide, 1:500 (Thermo Fisher Scientific), α-CD71-APC, 1:25 (Miltenyi Biotech), α-GypA-FITC, 1:100 (Stem Cell Technologies), and FITC-Phalloidin, 1:200 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Bone marrow and in vitro cultured RBC samples were stained at 4 °C for 20 min and P. vivax and P. falciparum samples at 37 °C for 20 min. Prior to analysis by flow cytometry, AccuCheck counting beads (Thermo Fisher Scientific) were added to each sample. All flow cytometry experiments were acquired on a Miltenyi MACSQuant instrument equipped with MACSQuantify version 2.11 and 405, 488, and 638-nm lasers and a minimum of 200 events were collected for each cell population being analyzed for the no lysis control sample. All subsequent gating and analysis was based on the no-lysis control sample. As lysis in subsequent samples resulted in ultimate destruction of the cell populations, this minimum event count was not able to be achieved for all samples. For all conditions analyzed, a minimum of 2000 events were collected for cell counting beads. Samples with parasitemia and or reticulocytemia below 0.05% were considered below the limit of detection. Data were analyzed using FlowJo (Version 10.4).

2.4 Staining and multispectral imaging

Traditionally, blood smears are stained with Wright‐Giemsa stains and their variants, which have a century‐long track record in the differential identification of peripheral blood cell populations. However, these stains suffer from a number of drawbacks, including significant incubation times, the requirements for washing steps, the need for fixation (which disrupts morphology) and variability in stain appearance between preparations. These shortcomings prove challenging in the POC context, where speed, automation and a compact form‐factor are desired. It is for this reason that Sight OLO departs from traditional staining methods and employs a novel staining and imaging approach.

Sight OLO uses a combination of brightfield and fluorescence microscopy, so that the identification of different cell populations can be aided by their optical and chemical signatures. In total, five illumination wavelengths are used to generate multispectral images of blood samples: violet (405 nm), green (517 nm) and red (633 nm) brightfield channels as well as ultra‐violet (365 nm) and blue (460 nm) fluorescent channels. Two fluorescent reagents are included in OLO's sample preparation process and mixed with blood as it undergoes the dilution process. The first of these reagents stains cell nuclear DNA while the other stains DNA, RNA and acidic cell organelles. Additionally, violet illumination, which is highly absorbed by hemoglobin, assists in identifying RBCs and quantifying cellular hemoglobin content. Characteristic images of different normal and abnormal blood cell types as acquired by OLO are presented using false coloring in Figure 1.

2.5 Scanning hardware

Sight OLO contains a fully automated fluorescence microscope which rapidly collects high‐quality images of the blood smear present within its single‐use test cartridge. The analyzer automatically scans at least 200 non‐overlapping fields within the sample, and at each field it acquires the several channels of fluorescent and brightfield imaging. In order to simplify manufacturing constraints on cartridge flatness, OLO automatically refocuses on the sample at every field. Each blood sample is thus "digitized" into approximately 6 GB of image data.

In addition to microscopy, the Sight OLO also measures hemoglobin using an unlysed, reagent‐free process utilizing four wavelengths to account for absorption and scattering. The hemoglobin chamber is directly filled with undiluted whole blood using capillary action and contains several measurement areas, which differ by optical path length. These areas are used to derive differential measurements in order to normalize for system parameters such as illumination intensity and manufacturing tolerances.

Bone marrow evaluation in MPN — bone marrow aspirate with iron stain and biopsy with trichrome and reticulin stains and bone marrow cytogenetics (with peripheral blood FISH if inaspirable) are necessary to accurately distinguish the bone marrow morphologic features between the disease subtypes (early or prefibrotic PMF, ET, and masked PV), and bone marrow histology shows hypercellularity and megakaryocytic proliferation. In the case of MF, bone marrow fibrosis is demonstrated on the reticulin stain and an additional trichrome stain is recommended to distinguish grade MF-1 from MF-2 or MF-3, as outlined in the 2022 WHO diagnostic criteria; progression of PV or ET to MF can only be detected by performing a bone marrow biopsy, and if there is evidence of mast cell aggregates, the diagnostic workup should be performed according to the NCCN Guidelines for Systemic Mastocytosis.

### Hemoglobin switch in the newborn: a flow cytometry analysis [^114Mo399]. Neonatology (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Hemoglobin (Hb) production switches upon birth from fetal Hb (HbF) to adult Hbs. HbF production is reactivated in sickle cell anemia and beta-thalassemia, where increased HbF ameliorates clinical symptoms and HbF-stimulating drugs are used for treatment. Understanding of the switch is therefore of basic interest and important for rational drug design. We studied the switch by determining changes after birth in the frequency and HbF-content of HbF-containing red blood cells (F-RBC) and reticulocytes (F-retics).

Methods

Blood samples of neonatal cord, babies in their first year and adults were stained with both phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-human HbF antibodies and the nucleic acid dye thiazol-orange, and analyzed by flow-cytometry. RBC and retics were distinguished by their different thiazol orange-derived fluorescence and their HbF content was determined by the intensity of phycoerythrin-derived fluorescence.

Results

The frequency of both F-RBC and F-retics decreases with time after birth. In most cases, the percentage of F-RBC was higher, but their HbF-content was lower than that of retics. The HbF content of the F-RBC and the F-retics showed a gradual decrease with age.

Conclusions

The results can be explained by two models: (A) A pool of homogenous stem cells that undergo gradual changes in their globin transcription pattern. (B) A pool of heterogeneous stem cells with varying HbF potentials that become active in an age-dependent manner: first, cells with a high HbF potential and then cells with a gradually lower HbF potential. In both models, these changes are induced by a biological clock and environmental factors.

### Detection of plasmodium species by high-resolution melt analysis of DNA from blood smears acquired in southwestern Uganda [^112BnyEf]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2018). Low credibility.

Microscopic diagnosis of malaria using Giemsa-stained blood smears is the standard of care in resource-limited settings. These smears represent a potential source of DNA for PCR testing to confirm Plasmodium infections or for epidemiological studies of archived samples. Therefore, we assessed the use of DNA extracts from stained blood smears for the detection of Plasmodium species using real-time PCR. We extracted DNA from archived blood smears and corresponding red blood cell pellets collected from asymptomatic children in southwestern Uganda in 2010. We then performed real-time PCR followed by high-resolution melting (HRM) to identify Plasmodium species, and we compared our results to those of microscopy. We analyzed a total of 367 blood smears and corresponding red blood cell pellets, including 185 smears (50.4%) that were positive by microscopy. Compared to microscopy, PCR-HRM analysis of smear DNA had a sensitivity of 93.0% (95% confidence interval, 88.2 to 96.2%) and a specificity of 96.7% (95% CI, 93.0 to 98.8%), and PCR-HRM analysis of pellet DNA had a sensitivity of 100.0% (95% CI, 98.0 to 100.0%) and a specificity of 94.0% (95% CI, 89.4 to 96.9%). Identification of positive PCR-HRM results to the species level revealed Plasmodium falciparum (92.0%), Plasmodium ovale (5.6%), and Plasmodium malariae (2.4%). PCR-HRM analysis of DNA extracts from Giemsa-stained thick blood smears or corresponding blood pellets had high sensitivity and specificity for malaria diagnosis, compared to microscopy. Therefore, blood smears can provide an adequate source of DNA for confirmation of Plasmodium species infections and can be used for retrospective genetic studies.

### A new indicator derived from reticulocyte hemoglobin content for screening iron deficiency in an area prevalent for thalassemia [^1145mVUe]. Laboratory Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To establish a new indicator derived from reticulocyte hemoglobin (Ret-He) content and red blood cell (RBC) indices for screening for iron deficiency anemia (IDA) in an area in whch thalassemia is prevalent.

Methods

Blood specimens from 304 women aged between 18 and 30 years residing in northeast Thailand were collected and measured for RBC and reticulocyte parameters. Iron deficiency was diagnosed when a participant had a serum ferritin level of less than 15 ng per mL. Thalassemia genotypes were defined by hemoglobin (Hb) and DNA analyses.

Results

Of the total participants, 25% had iron deficiency (ID) and 50% carried the thalassemia gene. Various mathematical formulas were established and analyzed using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The formula derived from Ret-He: (Ret-He/RDW-SD) × 10, was the best predictor for identifying ID among participants (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.812). Further testing of this indicator among individuals with positive thalassemia-screening results revealed stronger performance with an AUC of 0.874.

Conclusions

The findings indicate that the formula derived from Ret-He might be applicable for screening ID in areas in which thalassemia is prevalent.

### Reticulocyte hemoglobin content [^116wq1aL]. American Journal of Hematology (2008). Low credibility.

Under normal conditions, reticulocytes are the youngest erythrocytes released from the bone marrow into circulating blood. They mature for 1–3 days within the bone marrow and circulate for 1–2 days before becoming mature erythrocytes. Measurement of cellular hemoglobin concentration has long been reported by automated hematology analyzers as one of the red blood cell indices. The reticulocyte hemoglobin content (CHr or Ret-He) provides an indirect measure of the functional iron available for new red blood cell production over the previous 3–4 days. Measurement of reticulocyte hemoglobin content in peripheral blood samples is useful for diagnosis of iron deficiency in adults (Mast et al. Blood 2002;99:1489–1491) and children (Brugnara et al. JAMA 1999;281:2225–2230; Ullrich et al. JAMA 2005;294:924–930; Bakr and Sarette, Eur J Pediatr 2006;165:442–445). It provides an early measure of the response to iron therapy increasing within 2–4 days of the initiation of intravenous iron therapy (Brugnara et al. Blood 1994;83:3100–3101). Sequential measurements of reticulocyte hemoglobin content in patients with iron deficiency anemia provide a rapid means for assessing the erythropoietic response to iron replacement therapy (Brugnara et al. Blood 1994;83:3100–3101). It is also an early indicator or iron-restricted erythropoiesis in patients receiving erythropoietin therapy (Fishbane et al. Kidney Int 1997;52:217–222; Fishbane et al. Kidney Int 2001;60:2406–2411; Mittman et al. Am J Kidney Dis 1997;30:912–922; Tsuchiya et al. Clin Nephrol 2003;59:115–123; Chuang et al. Nephrol Dial Transplant 2003;18:370–377). Thus, reticulocyte hemoglobin content is a recent addition to an expanding list of biomarkers that can be used to differentiate iron deficiency from other causes of anemia.

### Ultrastructural, transcriptional, and functional differences between human reticulated and non-reticulated platelets [^111rnY2J]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Reticulated platelets (RP) are the youngest circulating platelets in blood. An increased amount of this subpopulation is associated with higher cardiovascular risk and mortality.

Objectives

It is unknown to what extent intrinsic properties of RP contribute to their hyperreactive features. This study is the first providing a multifactorial approach based on ultrastructural, transcriptional, and functional analysis of RP compared to non-RP sorted by flow cytometry.

Methods

Reticulated platelets and non-RP were sorted after platelet staining with SYTO 13. Employing transmission electron microscopy, 1089 micrographs were analyzed for platelet size, amounts of intracellular structures, and anatomical surrogates indicating activation. Long and small RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) were performed for analyzing differential gene expression. Functional analysis of P-selectin-an upregulated mRNA in RP-was performed in healthy subjects and patients on P2Y 12 -inhibitors.

Results

Electron micrographs uncovered distinct ultrastructural differences in RP versus non-RP. Cross sections were 1.9-fold larger in RP (P < .0001). Amounts of α-granules, dense granules, open canalicular system-openings, and mitochondria were increased in RP, which persisted after adjustment for platelet size. Long RNA-seq showed 1212 upregulated transcripts that are predominantly associated to platelet shape change, aggregation, and activation; 1264 mRNAs were downregulated in RP. Small RNA-seq did not reveal any differentially expressed transcripts. Functional analysis displayed higher P-selectin expression as compared to non-RP upon ADP- or TRAP-stimulation.

Conclusions

Our results demonstrate that altered intrinsic structural and molecular properties contribute to the hyperreactivity of RP. These properties and an increased amount of RP may account for the association with cardiovascular risk.

### Maturing reticulocytes internalize plasma membrane in glycophorin A-containing vesicles that fuse with autophagosomes before exocytosis [^113huJSw]. Blood (2012). Low credibility.

The erythrocyte is one of the best characterized human cells. However, studies of the process whereby human reticulocytes mature to erythrocytes have been hampered by the difficulty of obtaining sufficient numbers of cells for analysis. In the present study, we describe an in vitro culture system producing milliliter quantities of functional mature human adult reticulocytes from peripheral blood CD34(+) cells. We show that the final stage of reticulocyte maturation occurs by a previously undescribed mechanism in which large glycophorin A-containing vesicles forming at the cytosolic face of the plasma membrane are internalized and fuse with autophagosomes before expulsion of the autophagosomal contents by exocytosis. Early reticulocyte maturation is characterized by the selective elimination of unwanted plasma membrane proteins (CD71, CD98, and β1 integrin) through the endosome-exosome pathway. In contrast, late maturation is characterized by the generation of large glycophorin A-decorated vesicles of autophagic origin.

### Germline ERCC excision repair 6 like 2 (ERCC6L2) mutations lead to impaired erythropoiesis and reshaping of the bone marrow microenvironment [^1138SpxW]. British Journal of Haematology (2022). Medium credibility.

In line with the reduced BFU‐E clonogenicity, ERCC6L2 ‐KD HSPCs displayed delayed erythroid differentiation as they were slower to acquire CD71 + by day 3 (Figure 3B), while at day 14 fewer ERCC6L2 ‐KD cells expressed markers of late‐stage differentiation (CD71 − /CD235a +) versus controls (Figure 3C). Patient HSPCs displayed a similar phenotype, with fewer mature cells present at day 14 and a higher proportion of cells retaining CD71 + expression compared to healthy donor HSPCs (Figure 3D). Moreover, reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT‐qPCR) analysis of key genes in erythropoiesis (5'‐aminolevulinate synthase 2 [ALAS2], the enzyme essential for initiation of heme synthesis; FLVCR haem transporter 1 [FLVCR1], an exporter of excess haem to avoid toxicity; haemoglobin subunit beta [HBB], a haemoglobin subunit) revealed a significant downregulation of ALAS2 and HBB in the ERCC6L2 ‐KD erythroid cells, suggesting that haem and globin synthesis were suppressed (Figure 3E) and indicative of ineffective erythropoiesis. Altogether, this analysis suggests that loss of ERCC6L2 expression impedes erythroid differentiation.

To substantiate our findings, we generated RNA‐sequencing data from ERCC6L2 ‐deficient erythroid‐committed HSPCs and used an in silico approach to infer cell abundance at various stages of differentiation within our populations. Based on gene signatures derived from single‐cell RNA‐sequencing analysis of erythroid subtypes, we performed CIBERSORTx deconvolution on our bulk RNA‐sequencing data sets. Our analysis revealed that ERCC6L2‐ KD and patient erythroid cells had higher proportions of polychromatic erythroblasts compared to Scramble (61.5% and 36.6% respectively), which were enriched instead for more mature subtypes, orthochromatic erythroblasts (39.4%) or reticulocytes (32.6%) (Figure 4A; Figure S5A). Giemsa staining of erythroid‐committed HSPCs at day 14 showed a similar trend, with fewer mature erythroblasts/reticulocytes observed in the KD population (Figure S5B). Furthermore, within the reticulocyte signature, we observed an over‐representation of genes associated with excision repair (Figure 4B) suggesting that functional DNA repair pathways may be a requirement for terminal differentiation. Overall, both the in silico analysis and immunophenotyping suggest that ERCC6L2‐ deficiency results in delayed erythropoiesis.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES

Ethics Statement

The clinical infected red blood cell samples examined in this study were collected under the following ethical guidelines in the approved protocols: OXTREC 45–09 (University of Oxford, Centre for Clinical Vaccinology and Tropical Medicine, UK) and MUTM 2008–215 (Ethics Committee, Faculty of Tropical Medicine, Mahidol University, Thailand).

G6PD Characterization

Blood samples were collected at the Thailand–Myanmar border among subjects of Karen ethnicity where the prevalence of G6PD can reach 15%; the major variant found in the population is Mahidol (487G > A) (Supplementary Figure 1).

Blood samples were screened by fluorescent spot test (R&D Diagnostics, Greece) and genotyped for the Mahidol variant using a polymerase chain reaction–restriction fragment length polymorphism protocol. Quantitative phenotypic characterization of samples was performed by gold standard spectrophotometric assay using Trinity Kits (Trinity, Ireland) and flow-cytometric assay according to Shah et al.

Human Parasites

Thirty-four clinical isolates of P. vivax were collected from malaria patients receiving treatment at clinics run by the Shoklo Malaria Research Unit on the northwestern border of Thailand. The project was explained to all the patients before they provided informed consent prior to collection of blood by venipuncture. Whole blood (5 mL) was collected in lithium heparin collection tubes. These samples were cryopreserved in Glycerolyte 57 Solution (Baxter) after leukocyte depletion using a nonwoven fabric filter (Antoshin Pte Ltd). After thawing, the parasites present in the packed cells (1.5 mL per isolate) were cultured to the schizont stage in 12 mL McCoy 5A medium supplemented with 2.4 g/L D-glucose, 40 mg/mL gentamycin sulfate, and 20% heat-inactivated human AB serum, in an atmosphere of 5% O 2 at 37.5°C.

Immunomagnetic Erythrocyte Sorting

The selection of the CD71 + reticulocytes was performed using the magnetic-activated cell sorting system (Miltenyi Biotec). A total of 2 mL blood at 50% hematocrit in phosphate-buffered saline was passed through an LS column (Miltenyi), the purity of the positive and negative fractions was monitored by flow cytometry using Thiazole orange (Sigma-Aldrich) staining. The yield of CD71 + cells is upper 90% of purity.

Scanning Electron Microscopy

### Complete absence of GLUT1 does not impair human terminal erythroid differentiation [^116p2K7o]. Blood Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

To determine whether compensation for GLUT1 absence is enabled by prolonged expansion of the BEL-A cell line, CRISPR KO was performed on cultured primary hematopoietic progenitors nucleofected 3 days after isolation, as indicated (Figure 2 A). Cells were cultured for 21 days and GLUT1 expression assessed by flow cytometry throughout differentiation (Figure 2 B). Note that 48 hours after nucleofection (day 5) it is already possible to discriminate between NT controls and GLUT1–targeted populations with a clear negative comprising ∼75% of the total cells discernible on day 6.

Flow cytometry cell sorting — sample handling and user responsibilities are specified. Cells should be "stained, kept, and sorted into protein-free buffers to avoid contamination with ambient proteins". For RNA- or DNA-based assays, rare or fragile cells "can be sorted directly into a lysis buffer", but because the solutions "do not readily mix, users should remember to pause the sort every 3 to 5 minutes and flick the collection tube, to ensure proper lysis". "Users are encouraged to do optimization experiments and be fully in charge of all experimental steps", and "a relatively experienced user should be able to perform sorts independent from the flow core staff once the cytometer has been properly set up and quality-control steps performed".

ctDNA pre-analytical handling — Methods to extract nucleic acids from plasma or serum were initially varied, which led to inconsistent results; currently, most investigators use plasma derived from EDTA anticoagulated blood. Although larger amounts of nucleic acids appear in the serum, these have been demonstrated to be from lysed residual white blood cells, and the peripheral blood white cell DNA can present a significant problem for identification of ctDNA because it is present in great excess and can decrease sensitivity of detection; several commercial blood collection tubes for extracellular DNA and RNA are available, but they are not used in most protocols.

Examples of iRBCs containing a single-ring, multiple rings, a trophozoite or a schizont. Four images are displayed for each iRBC: DAPI-filtered (first column, in pink), FITC-filtered (second column, in green), brightfield (third column), and composite (fourth column) images.

Bright-field IFC images also showed visible differences between singly versus multiply infected iRBCs. For example, cell #5610 (Figure 2B) shows a representative iRBC containing three rings with three distinct HO- and TO-stained foci inside of each of the three rings. Infected red blood cells containing larger trophozoite/schizont parasites showed even stronger HO- and TO-stained fluorescence and bright field microscopy showed the dense texture of such iRBC (Figure 2B, e.g. Cell 9389 and Cell 4009, respectively). Thus, IFC confirmed that HO- and TO-staining reliably separated individual ring stage parasites from other stages.

### Reticulocytes in donor blood units enhance red blood cell alloimmunization [^117XXHCo]. Haematologica (2023). Medium credibility.

Approximately 70% of the blood supply in the United States derives from repeat volunteer blood donors. Because blood donation typically removes approximately 10% of the total blood volume, compensatory stress erythropoiesis increases production of erythroid precursors and the premature release of reticulocytes; although the minimum inter-donation interval for blood donation in the US is 56 days, elevated reticulocyte counts (over baseline) are observed even after approximately 160 days after donation. Thus, frequent donation by repeat blood donors can yield RBC units with higher reticulocyte counts. Additionally, current guidance for iron-deficient volunteers is to take iron supplements before donation, which also promote stress erythropoiesis. Reticulocytes differ from their mature counterparts by: i) containing immune-enhancing organelles (e.g. mitochondria), lipids, and residual RNA; ii) expressing surface antigens that promote adherence (e.g. CD44, CD36); and iii) being larger and less deformable. Compared to steady-state reticulocytes, stress erythropoiesis-induced reticulocytes also contain significantly more organelles (e.g. mitochondria, ribosomes), express higher levels of surface molecules mediating adherence, and have shorter circulatory lifespans due to their size, decreased deformability, and susceptibility to shear stress. Thus, reticulocytes, and especially stressinduced reticulocytes, contain and/or express immuneenhancing components.

HBV DNA, HBsAg and Sirius red triple staining as a convenient molecular pathology examination on the virological and histological status of CHB

Since previous results suggested spatially distinct distribution of HBV DNA and HBsAg in accordance with our previous report, we sought to combine these two markers on one section by serially staining HBV DNA and HBsAg. Furthermore, we performed a Sirius red counterstain to provide a histological background of collagen fibres. The blue purple (HBV DNA), brown (HBsAg) and red combination resulted in a high colour contrast, easy-to-interpret images (figure 6). Importantly, this triple stain revealed some interesting phenomena. The HBV DNA and HBsAg mostly exhibited a mutually exclusion pattern as we have reported. In addition, it was found that S-rich cells mostly resided in minimally fibrotic region (figure 6A), while HBV DNA positive cells were frequently observed to be surrounded by collagen fibres (figure 6B–D). In some sections, transitions between S-rich and DNA-rich cells could be readily observed near the fibrotic region (figure 6E–F, note cells with both DNA and S signal). Collectively, the triple staining method provides pathologists a more comprehensive view of the virological activities in relation to the histological progression of disease.

### Molecular techniques in haematopathology: what and how? [^113ZhN1Y]. Histopathology (2025). Medium credibility.

Figure 3
Schematic work‐flow of sequencing platforms. (A) Sanger sequencing is based on the selective incorporation of chain‐terminating dideoxynucleotides (ddNTPs) by DNA polymerase during DNA replication. During the chain termination PCR, DNA polymerase incorporates deoxynucleotides (dNTPs) into the growing DNA strand. When a fluorescently labelled ddNTP is incorporated, the strand elongation is terminated as ddNTPs lack a 3′‐OH group required to form a phosphodiester bond with the next nucleotide. The resulting terminated DNA fragments of various lengths are then separated by capillary electrophoresis. The fluorescence of the terminating ddNTPs is detected, and the DNA sequence is determined by the order of the fluorescence peaks recorded, which corresponds to the nucleotide sequence in the DNA strand. (B) Next‐generation sequencing (NGS) is a high‐throughput methodology that allows for the simultaneous sequencing of millions of DNA targets from multiple patient samples. Here, Illumina sequencing chemistry is depicted. During NGS library preparation, DNA is fragmented into smaller pieces. Sequencing adapters and indexes are ligated to the ends of these DNA fragments. The indexes enable sample identification within pooled data. Depending on whether targeted NGS or whole‐genome sequencing (WGS) is desired, a target enrichment step may be included. Libraries from multiple samples are pooled together and loaded onto a flow cell coated with oligonucleotides complementary to the sequencing adapters. The library DNA is then immobilized on the surface and undergoes bridge amplification, generating clusters of amplified DNA. These clusters augment the fluorescent signal during sequencing cycles. During sequencing, fluorescently labelled nucleotides are added. Each incorporated nucleotide emits a fluorescent signal that is detected and recorded. This process is repeated for each nucleotide in the sequence. This sequencing is performed in parallel across millions of clusters, enabling the massive parallel sequencing of multiple targets from multiple patients. (C) Error‐corrected NGS enhances sequencing accuracy by incorporating molecular barcodes and consensus sequence analysis to correct errors introduced during sequencing and amplification, making it especially useful in MRD assessment. During library preparation, molecular barcodes of unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) are attached to each DNA fragment before amplification. After sequencing, reads sharing the same UMIs are grouped and analysed. This allows for the identification of true mutations (e.g. "A" in all reads of the orange read group) and distinguishes them from random errors (e.g. "G", "T", "A" in a subset of reads in the green and red read groups). (D) Long‐read sequencing. Various platforms exist and Oxford Nanopore technology is depicted here. Nanopore array is submerged in an electrolyte solution and an electric potential is applied across the membrane. Double‐stranded DNA is unwound by the motor protein and the single‐strand molecule passes through the nanopore one at a time. As each nucleotide passes through the nanopore, it causes characteristic disruptions in the ionic current flowing through the pore. These disruptions generate a unique signal for each nucleotide. The device detects and records these electrical signals in real‐time, producing raw signal data that corresponds to the nucleotide sequence of the DNA molecule.

### Megakaryocyte-and erythroblast-specific cell-free DNA patterns in plasma and platelets reflect thrombopoiesis and erythropoiesis levels [^112EsKWq]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

This study also provides evidence that platelets contain megakaryocyte-derived nuclear DNA. An important implication of this situation is that it provides a non-invasive window into the genome and epigenome of the megakaryocyte, a cell type particularly difficult to interrogate due to its relative scarceness within the bone marrow. The presence of somatic mutations in megakaryocytes, as well as epigenomic aberrations, can therefore be interrogated by analysis of platelet samples. Additionally, gene expression of the megakaryocyte, as reflected by transcription related epigenetic modifications, may be indirectly evaluated via the platelet epigenome. Interestingly, we found copy number alterations in the DNA of platelets, with some chromosomes consistently over- or under-represented. We speculate that this situation reflects the 3D organization of the megakaryocyte genome, affecting the likelihood that certain genomic regions will be trapped in platelets. Finally, our results suggest that megakaryocyte cfDNA is derived directly from megakaryocytes and not from platelets. This conclusion is based on the lack of Y chromosome fragments in the plasma of female recipients of male platelets; on the fact that copy number alterations seen in platelets are not present in cfDNA; and on the finding that platelets capture only 0.1% of the DNA of the parent cell. Further studies are required to validate this conclusion and understand the underlying mechanisms. It is important to note that this study was performed in individuals without evidence of platelet hyperactivation. It is possible that during platelet activation, DNA is indeed released directly from platelets. If this is the case, platelet-derived DNA may be an important analyte for the study of hypercoagulable states. This should be a focus of future research.

We have not addressed whether platelet DNA is concentrated in a subset of platelets or if it is distributed randomly throughout the platelet population. Additionally, the fate and function of the megakaryocyte genomic fragments trapped within platelets is not clear. It is well established that platelets contain RNA which undergoes translation to protein, yet this RNA is generally understood to have been transcribed in the megakaryocyte prior to platelet formation or from mitochondrial DNA within the platelet. Given our findings that platelets contain nuclear DNA, the question as to whether transcription of nuclear DNA occurs within the platelet should be revisited.

### Pseudoreticulocytosis in a patient with myelodysplastic syndrome [^114wa1vp]. American Journal of Hematology (2022). Medium credibility.

A 52‐year‐old woman diagnosed in 2017 with low‐risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) with multilineage dysplasia (R‐IPSS score 1.5) is evaluated for persistent reticulocytosis since 4 years, without evidence of bleeding or hemolysis.

Her laboratory results indicate the following: red blood count 3.56 × 10 12 /L (reference range: 3.8–5.2 × 10 12 /L); hemoglobin 10.1 g/dL (11.7–15.7 g/dL); hematocrit 0.32 L/L (0.35–0.47 L/L); MCV 93 fl (81–99 fl); MCHC 313 g/L (310–360 g/L); red cell distribution width 16.7% (11%–15%); reticulocytes 929 × 10 9 /L (20–120 × 10 9 /L), 26.1% (0.5%–1.5%); platelets 146 × 10 9 /L (150–350 × 10 9 /L); and leukocytes 2.2 × 10 9 /L (4.0–10 × 10 9 /L). Of note, MCV, expected to be increased in case of reticulocytosis is normal. Hemolytic parameters (LDH, bilirubin, haptoglobin) and creatinine are normal. The direct antiglobulin test is negative. Scattergram (Image 1A, white circle) shows small‐size reticulocytes with dim fluorescence (low RNA content), corresponding to a population of old reticulocytes. Peripheral blood smear (Image 1B) shows marked anisopoikilocytosis, polychromasia, and anisochromia. Presence of reticulocytes is confirmed on cresyl blue stain (Image 1C, arrows).

### A genome-wide association study of blood cell morphology identifies cellular proteins implicated in disease aetiology [^116zLF7h]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Sysmex XN-1000 automated haematology analysis

The Sysmex XN series of haematology analysers can be configured to use various combinations of seven measurement channels: an impedance channel, a photometric channel and five flow-cytometry channels. The analysers used for the INTERVAL study were configured to use the following six channels:
RBC/PLT (red cell and platelet counts/volumes using Coulter's impedance principle)
HGB (photometric measurement of total blood HGB)
WNR (white cell and nucleated red cell flow-cytometry)
WDF (white cell differential flow-cytometry)
RET (reticulocyte and red cell flow-cytometry)
PLT-F (platelet flow-cytometry).

The channels used to measure each of the 63 traits we studied are indicated in Supplementary Data 2. These traits include all the continuously distributed (i.e. without a discrete component) variables reported by the analysers (when configured as described) that are not cCBC traits.

The analyser generates an aliquot of blood for each measurement channel. The flow-cytometry channel aliquots are diluted (1:200 for RET/PLT-F channels, 1:60 for other channels) and pre-treated with channel-specific reagents which differentially lyse and perforate cells by type. The aliquots are then treated with channel specific reagents containing dyes that bind to nucleic acids in organelles and the nucleus. The PLT-F flow-cytometry channel uses a reagent containing an oxazine based dye (Fluorocell PLT), while the other flow-cytometry channels use reagents containing a polymethine dye (Fluorocell WNR, Fluorocell WDF and Fluorocell RET). Each flow-cytometry channel measures three cell-level properties of each particle in the blood aliquot: side fluorescence, forward scatter and side scatter. Side fluorescence is a measure of cell nucleic acid content, but also depends on cell membrane lipid content; forward scatter is a measure of cell size; side scatter is a measure of cell granularity. The cell-level measurements are used by the analyser to classify cells by type (Fig. 1). The classification algorithms are commercially confidential. Individual-level traits are calculated by the analyser from summaries of the cell-type specific cell-level measurements.

### Analysis of remnant reticulocyte mRNA reveals new genes and antisense transcripts expressed in the human erythroid lineage [^1153TQzE]. Haematologica (2004). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

We studied the gene expression profile of human purified reticulocytes to provide a transcriptional basis for the study of erythroid biology, differentiation and hematologic disorders.

Design and Methods

We screened highly purified blood reticulocytes from ten healthy adult volunteers. We chose a modified protocol of serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE), the serial analysis of downsized extracts (SADE).

Results

Data analysis revealed that 64% of gene signatures (tags) matched with known genes; mainly hemoglobin. In addition to the abundant globin mRNA, SAGE analysis identified previously described genes and new transcripts. In reticulocytes, which are poor in mRNA, we also identified 9% of EST and 27% of tags that did not match with any known genes. Mining our data, 70% of the unknown tags and 39% of tags identifying EST were found to be specific to the reticulocyte. We demonstrated the presence of a mRNA that matched with the reverse sequence of the hemoglobin b (HBB) transcript.

Interpretation and Conclusions

This is the first description of an antisense transcript of the human HBB gene suggesting regulation by way of sense-antisense pairing. The well-characterized genes found in the SAGE library were genes specific to the blood cell lineage, housekeeping genes and, interestingly, genes not previously described in the reticulocyte. Furthermore the study provides markers of the erythroid lineage regulated during the differentiation process as observed in in vitro experiments.

### Improving the quality and reproducibility of flow cytometry in the lung. An official American Thoracic Society workshop report [^114RsA7w]. American Journal of Respiratory Cell and Molecular Biology (2019). High credibility.

Flow cytometry panel design and viability controls in lung samples — Panels should be tested and adjusted before experiments to clearly define cells and markers, and all panels should include a viability dye, particularly when using digested tissue. The use of light-scattering properties (FSC vs. SSC) as a sole method to assess viability is not sufficient; when excessive debris cannot be mitigated, a fluorescent DNA-binding dye compatible with the fluorescence panel design can be used on fixed samples to differentiate between dead cells and nonnucleated debris. To define truly positive populations in multicolor experiments, use of fluorescence-minus-one controls is highly recommended, and FSC (cell size) and SSC (cell granularity) should be used only in conjunction with specific cell markers and not on their own.

### Plasmodium vivax infection compromises reticulocyte stability [^117FzjYt]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

The structural integrity of the host red blood cell (RBC) is crucial for propagation of Plasmodium spp. during the disease-causing blood stage of malaria infection. To assess the stability of Plasmodium vivax-infected reticulocytes, we developed a flow cytometry-based assay to measure osmotic stability within characteristically heterogeneous reticulocyte and P. vivax-infected samples. We find that erythroid osmotic stability decreases during erythropoiesis and reticulocyte maturation. Of enucleated RBCs, young reticulocytes which are preferentially infected by P. vivax, are the most osmotically stable. P. vivax infection however decreases reticulocyte stability to levels close to those of RBC disorders that cause hemolytic anemia, and to a significantly greater degree than P. falciparum destabilizes normocytes. Finally, we find that P. vivax new permeability pathways contribute to the decreased osmotic stability of infected-reticulocytes. These results reveal a vulnerability of P. vivax-infected reticulocytes that could be manipulated to allow in vitro culture and develop novel therapeutics.

### A method for the continuous calculation of the age of labeled red blood cells [^113Qp2Ls]. American Journal of Hematology (2008). Low credibility.

New methods for labeling red blood cells (RBC) and monitoring their survival have made it possible to explore changes in the properties of RBC as they age in the circulation. We have adapted a method, originally developed for studying wild animals, to calculate the age of a random sample of labeled RBC from their survival curve. We also show how this method can be expanded to allow continuous calculation of the mean age of the labeled RBC population at any time after labeling. It is expected that this analytical approach will be useful in the study of age-dependent RBC changes.

### In vitro maturation of nascent reticulocytes to erythrocytes [^113cq493]. Blood (2005). Low credibility.

Most studies of mammalian reticulocyte maturation have used blood reticulocytes. Nascent reticulocytes, as found in bone marrow, have not been available in developmentally synchronized populations. Nascent murine reticulocytes formed in vitro by enucleation of Friend virus-infected erythroblasts were purified and recultured for 110 hours. At 0 hours, all recultured cells were lobulated and contained dense, centralized reticulin. By 110 hours, about 20% to 25% of the cells became biconcave erythrocytes. Most ribosomes and cellular RNAs were degraded within 20 hours, and during that period, heme synthesis declined from a rate equal to that of late erythroblasts to less than 10% of that rate. Many mitochondria appeared normal until they showed outer membrane swelling, degradation, and apparent fusion with intracellular vacuoles at 40 hours of culture. During the period of mitochondrial loss, Bcl-X(L), an antiapoptotic protein that accumulates during erythroblast differentiation and maintains mitochondrial membrane integrity, demonstrated progressive decreases and changes consistent with deamidation. Nevertheless, the reticulocytes did not undergo apoptosis, because their apoptotic machinery was degraded. This experimental system that provides a developmentally synchronized population of nascent murine reticulocytes that mature into biconcave erythrocytes in vitro should be useful in further investigations of the cellular events involved in reticulocyte maturation.

Centrifugation parameters in cfDNA processing — Centrifugation is another important variable in the cfDNA extraction process, and carefully separating plasma from the buffy coat and red blood cells helps to maintain the purity of cfDNA. Approximately 59% (726/1228) of publications reported their centrifugation specifications, with CVPs reporting slightly more frequently (68%, 21/31). The most common separation process was a two-step centrifugation method reported in 65% of total publications that reported centrifugation specifications (472/726). In this two-step method, samples were centrifuged at: i) lower speeds (< 5000 x g) for both steps (46%, 219/472), ii) a lower speed for the first step and a higher speed (> 14,000 x g) for the second step (49%, 232/472), iii) a high speed for both steps (0.2%, 1/472), or iv) speeds that were not reported (4%, 20/472). Another large portion used a single-step method at either a low or high speed (35%, 254/726). The duration of centrifugations varied widely from 5 to 30 minutes, with 10-minute centrifugations being the most common. Few publications (1%, 14/1228) indicated different centrifugation conditions for specific collection tube types, and Forty-two percent (513/1228) did not report plasma separation conditions. For this review, lack of data and comparability precluded recommendation of a single centrifugation condition, and increased reporting of plasma separation and post-separation storage conditions in future publications is required to develop a standardized, evidence-based recommendation.

### Megakaryocyte-and erythroblast-specific cell-free DNA patterns in plasma and platelets reflect thrombopoiesis and erythropoiesis levels [^116kwQL2]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Platelets contain genomic DNA from MK

Platelets are products of megakaryocytes, that contain megakaryocyte-derived pre-mRNA and mRNAand carry out splicing and protein synthesis, but do not contain a nucleus and are not thought to contain genomic DNA. However it has been reported that platelets contain histone proteins, raising the possibility that they may carry some megakaryocyte DNA as well. To test this idea, we isolated platelets (see methods) and performed DNA extraction (Supplementary Table S2). We reasoned that DNA found in platelets could be genomic DNA of a megakaryocyte that was trapped within forming platelets, or alternatively could be cfDNA from other cell types that adhered to the external surface of platelets or was internalized, similar to tumor-derived mRNA which has been suggested to be present in platelets of individuals with cancer. To distinguish between these possibilities, we performed targeted bisulfite sequencing of regions uniquely unmethylated in megakaryocytes in the platelet DNA concentrates. Strikingly, platelet DNA was found to be mostly unmethylated at these loci (~80%), suggesting megakaryocytes as the main origin of platelet DNA (Fig. 2A). Platelet concentrates also contained DNA methylation markers of leukocytes and hepatocytes, suggesting the presence of some DNA from these cell types (Fig. 2A). To distinguish between DNA associated with the external surface of platelets and DNA present within platelets we treated platelet isolates with DNaseI, reasoning that this enzyme would have an effect only on external DNA. Strikingly, DNase treatment did not reduce the concentration of megakaryocyte DNA in platelets but did eliminate leukocyte- and hepatocyte-derived DNA (Fig. 2B and Supplementary Fig. S5), suggesting that the megakaryocyte DNA is present within the platelet. Interestingly, platelet DNA is present in the form of large molecular weight DNA, in contrast to nucleosome-size fragments of typical cfDNA (Supplementary Fig. S6). Notably, the total amount of DNA present in platelets (~2×10 −6 genomes/platelet) suggests that only a small fraction (~0.1%) of a megakaryocyte genome DNA is present in the platelets that derive from this cell (Supplementary Table S2).

B Uncentrifuged platelet concentrates (platelets in plasma) were analyzed with or without DNase treatment, demonstrating that DNase treatment reduces leukocyte and liver, but not MK markers in platelets.

### Megakaryocyte and platelet transcriptomics for discoveries in human health and disease [^113hspne]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2020). Medium credibility.

Aging can also occur in platelets as they circulate in the blood. Reticulated platelets (RPs) represent a subset of circulating platelets that are thought to be newly released. RPs are generally larger and contain more RNA compared with mature platelets, and in some settings are hyperreactive. – Clinically, RPs are associated with cardiovascular events, and may also predict adverse outcomes in sepsis, where thrombosis risk is elevated. By flow cytometry, investigators separated RPs (defined as platelets with the highest thiazole orange staining) from mature platelets. Cell populations were then sequenced and compared. As has been previously reported, isolated RPs were hyperreactive compared with mature platelets. Consistent with this cellular phenotype, there were a large number of DE transcripts in RPs (n = 1744) and biological processes related to platelet activation and hemostasis were enriched in RPs. Small-RNA sequencing identified only a small number of DE miRNAs in RPs (n = 9). However, all 9 miRNAs were downregulated in RPs.

Genes upregulated in RPs and involved in platelet activation and hemostasis included the thrombin receptor PAR4, the thromboxane A2 receptor, and number integrin and adhesion molecules, including ITGA2B (CD41, or αIIb protein). This transcriptional-based study, therefore, provides new insights into prior observations that RPs are hyperreactive and supports identified associations between RPs and thrombotic events. As with other publications highlighted in this review, these investigators have made their sequencing data publicly available.

Platelet transcriptional profiling can also provide unique insights into (patho)physiological processes occurring during human disease. We highlight 2 recent examples where RNA-seq led to new biological discoveries during inflammatory diseases. In the first example, investigators studied the platelet transcriptome in persons living with HIV (all of which were on anti-retroviral therapies and had HIV RNA viral loads < 200 copies/mL) and healthy donors. Clinical studies have demonstrated that persons living with HIV have an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, even when virally suppressed. Yet the mechanisms driving this increased cardiovascular disease risk remain incompletely understood.

Screening PvTRAgs for erythrocyte and reticulocyte binding activity.

a Affinity purified biotinylated recombinant proteins were multimerised on streptavidin coated Nile Red beads and incubated with a mixture of erythrocytes and reticulocytes. Reticulocytes were labelled with Thiazole Orange (staining rRNA) before binding was assessed using flow cytometry. Erythrocytes are devoid of any genetic material, so are not labelled with TO and are in the lower half of the plots. Any binding with protein-labelled beads will cause a shift in the population of cells towards upper right (reticulocyte, green) or lower right (erythrocyte, red). The figure is created with Biorender.com. b Bar graph showing the binding of the multimerised PvTRAgs to reticulocytes and erythrocytes. PvRBP2b 169–813 previously reported to have binding activity against reticulocytes was used as positive control, while Pfs25, a sexual stage antigen, was used as a negative control for this assay. A cut-off value for positive binding was set as 10% of reticulocytes bound, based on the maximum binding value observed for the bead-only control sample. PVP01_0000100 and PVP01_0503700 are both substantially above this cut-off for both reticulocyte and erythrocyte binding and are termed 'strong binders', while PVP01_0949200, PVP01_0700900 and PVP01_1469900 are above the cut-off for reticulocytes only, and are considered much weaker. The data represent the average of n = 3 technical replicates.

### Neutrophil "plucking" on megakaryocytes drives platelet production and boosts cardiovascular disease [^115xaSny]. Immunity (2022). Medium credibility.

Blood count analysis

Murine blood was drawn by intracardial puncture from anesthetized [isoflurane (DeltaSelect), fentanyl i.p. (0.05 mg/kg body weight; CuraMed Pharma)] mice and collected in a tube containing acid citrate dextrose (39 mM citric acid, 75 mM sodium citrate, 135 mM dextrose; ACD) buffer. Blood counts were analyzed on a hematology system blood counter (IDEXX ProCyte DX) or Gallios flow cytometer (Beckman) / BD FACSCantoII flow cytometer (BD) after addition of specific labelling antibodies (i.e. CD41) and fluorescent bead calibration. Therefore, 2 μL murine blood was stained with the respective antibody (dilution 1:100) for 20 min at RT in the dark before 4 μL multifluorescent counting beads were added and flow cytometry analysis was performed.

Flow cytometry

Erythrocyte-lysed whole blood or bone marrow cells were surface-stained in PBS for 30 min at 4°C. Multiparametric flow cytometric analyses were performed on Gallios flow cytometer (Beckman) or BD FACSCantoII flow cytometer (BD). Dead cells were excluded by FSC, SSC and 49,6-diamino-2-phenylin-dole (DAPI) stain. Neutrophils were gated as Gr-1 + (RB6–8C5)/ CD115 - (AFS98) events; monocytes, B-cells or T-cells were gated as Gr-1 + / CD115 +, CD45R + (RA3–6B2) or CD3 + (17A2) events respectively. Mature MKs were gated by as CD41 + /CD42d + double positive population. MK ploidy was quantified following propidium iodide staining in MKs.

Quantification of reticulated platelets

Reticulated platelet counts were determined by analyzing fixed (1% PFA for 10 min) citrate blood. Human reticulated platelets were stained with CD41-PE (1:100) and thiazole orange (250 ng/ml) for 20 min, before being analyzed by flow cytometry. Murine reticulated platelets were detected following a double staining with CD42d-PE antibody and thiazole orange (1 μg/ml).

### Red blood cells and platelets conventional and research parameters: stability remarks before their interpretation [^115RcVJY]. Laboratory Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To analyze the stability of red blood cells, platelets, and reticulocytes of the research parameters, in combination with the respective conventional parameters, for each analyte; and to quantify the morphological changes in these analytes, to propose a correction factor for each.

Methods

Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) blood specimens from patients were reanalyzed in 2-hour intervals and then, the mean percentage (X¯t%) changes were calculated. To evaluate the stability of the analyzed material, we used different criteria according to within-run and between-batch analytical variation, as well as intraindividual biological variation. Next, the mean deviation percentage of the parameters that undergo time-dependent significant changes was calculated, to obtain a correction factor.

Results

Several conventional and research parameters showed significant alterations in the stability at an early time after arrival at the laboratory.

Conclusion

Cell variations over time can be quantified and corrected by applying a multiplying factor to the signal obtained in the analyzer.

Microfluidic adhesion assays

The SCD Biochip is composed of functionalized microfluidic channels, as previously described. For studying the adhesion of HbA-containing erythrocytes, microchannels were functionalized with 0.1 g/mL poly-d-lysine for nonspecific adhesion. To study the adhesion of samples from subjects with HbSS SCD, microchannels were coated with LN to induce erythrocyte-specific adhesions. LN or poly-d-lysine functionalized microfluidic channels were injected with 15 μL of unprocessed whole blood at a shear stress of 0.1 Pa, corresponding to the average postcapillary shear stress. After nonadherent cells were removed by an equivalently SpO 2 -adjusted buffer wash at 0.1 Pa, adherent erythrocytes were analyzed by staining with acridine orange (thiazole orange), a fluorescent cationic dye selective for nucleic acids, at 0.1 mg/mL concentration within microchannels. Reticulocyte staining with acridine orange is a well-established technique with high detection accuracy. The experiments were performed under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions, with the latter achieving an SpO 2 of ∼83% in the blood, using a micro-tube gas exchanger technology developed by us. Inhibition experiments with anti-sulfatide antibody were performed with sample aliquots from 10 unique patients with HbSS SCD. The treatments and microfluidic flow experiments were simultaneously performed at the same time. Adherent erythrocytes in the microchannels were visualized for quantification with the Olympus CellSens software using an Olympus IX83 inverted microscope and QImaging EXi Blue CCD camera at 20×. The scanned images covered an actual area of ∼32 mm 2 on the microchannels.

Categorization of adherent red blood cells as reticulocytes and mature erythrocytes

Red blood cells were categorized as either reticulocytes, which contain nucleic acids, or mature erythrocytes, which do not (Figure 1) according to the Heilmeyer classification. More than 47 000 individual cells from 15 homozygous patients with SCD were analyzed systematically and categorized using a semiautomated workflow using JavaScript and a MATLAB algorithm (supplemental Notes 1).

Figure 1.
Adhered erythrocytes are categorized as reticulocytes or mature erythrocytes based on the fluorescence intensity. Heilmeyer classification groups reticulocytes into 4 groups, group 1 with dense, clumped reticulum, group 2 extended network of loose reticulum, group 3 scattered granules with residual reticulum, and group 4 scattered granules. Mature erythrocytes without nucleic acids are not visible in the fluorescent channel. The same classification and notation are used for distinguishing adhered reticulocytes and mature erythrocytes.

### Clinical utility of genotyping human erythrocyte antigens [^1146pj5y]. Laboratory Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Traditional serological methods, which have been used for decades to evaluate the human erythrocyte antigen (HEA) composition of recipient and donor specimens, have some serious limitations. Specific reagent antisera are not available for all clinically relevant antigens (eg, V antigen). Reagent antisera are expensive, and serological testing is labor intensive. The results of serological testing are subjective and semiquantitative (eg, microscopic, weak, 1+, 2+, 3+, 4+), and may vary from one technologist to another. Further, in many clinical situations, serological testing may be difficult or impossible. Recent developments in nucleic acid-based testing (molecular diagnostics) have made it possible to genotype HEA in the clinical laboratory. Most allelic variations occur due to single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), which can be detected and from which the phenotypes can be predicted. HEA genotyping offers several technical and clinical advantages compared with serological testing. The Immucor PreciseType HEA Test is the first and currently the only platform for clinical testing approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), to our knowledge.

### Non-muscle myosin II drives vesicle loss during human reticulocyte maturation [^1119TgNz]. Haematologica (2018). Low credibility.

These proteomic datasets were analyzed with the objective of determining possible targets for further study of reticulocyte maturation. First, a broad comparison of protein expression changes between reticulocytes and erythrocytes was performed. In accordance with previous literature, where a loss of protein content is expected in maturation, both native and cultured reticulocytes have a higher abundance of most proteins, as shown in Figure 1B. However, protein clusters where expression is higher in the erythrocyte can also be observed and were found to encompass both contaminating material (serum proteins and keratins) and functional proteins (e.g. carbonic anhydrase 1/2/3). Only six proteins were significantly increased (average log 2 fold-change > 1) in the erythrocyte population, and all corresponded to contamination except for carbonic anhydrase 1. This observation reflects the fact that residual protein synthesis still takes place in the reticulocyte by means of the ribosomes and RNA present in the cell, and carbonic anhydrase 1 in particular is known to be synthesized during maturation. Some inter-sample variation was observed between the same cell types, likely due to variable purity in the CD71 isolation protocol (Online Supplementary Figure S1). Furthermore, the heterogeneous nature of reticulocyte populations undergoing maturation creates inherent difficulties for comparative proteomics. Nonetheless, native and in vitro -derived (cultured) reticulocytes were found to exhibit a very similar global protein expression profile (Figure 1C). A summary of significant differences in abundance is shown in Figure 1D. The proteins with the greatest difference in abundance between cultured and native reticulocytes were processed using the STRING database to create protein-protein interaction networks (Online Supplementary Figure S2), which ease data visualization. It was observed that protein families containing a large number of proteins skewed the resulting networks. Thus, ribosomal proteins, initiation factors and tRNA synthetases were removed from the dataset and the network was re-analyzed using the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software. The top scoring networks are summarized in Online Supplementary Table S2 and the top four networks are shown in Online Supplementary Figure S3.

### MtDNA mutagenesis impairs elimination of mitochondria during erythroid maturation leading to enhanced erythrocyte destruction [^113t3fiG]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

Haematopoietic progenitor cells show special sensitivity to mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutagenesis, which suggests that increased mtDNA mutagenesis could underlie anemias. Here we show that elevated mtDNA mutagenesis in mice with a proof-reading deficient mtDNA polymerase (PolG) leads to incomplete mitochondrial clearance, with asynchronized iron loading in erythroid precursors, and increased total and free cellular iron content. The resulting Fenton chemistry leads to oxidative damage and premature destruction of erythrocytes by splenic macrophages. Our data indicate that mitochondria actively contribute to their own elimination in reticulocytes and modulate iron loading. Asynchrony of this sequence of events causes severe mitochondrial anaemia by depleting the organism of red blood cells and the bone marrow of iron. Our findings account for the anaemia development in a progeroid mouse model and may have direct relevance to the anemias associated with human mitochondrial disease and ageing.

### Stress reticulocytes lose transferrin receptors by an extrinsic process involving spleen and macrophages [^115UAkJG]. American Journal of Hematology (2016). Low credibility.

As they mature into erythrocytes during normal erythropoiesis, reticulocytes lose surface transferrin receptors before or concurrently with reticulin. Exosome release accounts for most of the loss of transferrin receptors from reticulocytes. During erythropoietic stress, reticulocytes are released early from hematopoietic tissues and have increased reticulin staining and transferrin receptors. Flow cytometry of dually stained erythrocytes of mice recovering from phlebotomy demonstrated delayed loss of reticulin and transferrin receptors during in vitro maturation compared to in vivo maturation, indicating that an in vivo process extrinsic to the reticulocytes facilitates their maturation. Splenectomy or macrophage depletion by liposomal clodronate inhibited in vivo maturation of reticulocytes and increased the numbers of reticulin-negative, transferrin receptor-positive cells during and after recovery from phlebotomy. This reticulin-negative, transferrin receptor-positive population was rarely found in normal mice. Transmission electron microscopy demonstrated that the reticulin-negative, transferrin receptor-positive cells were elongated and discoid erythrocytes, but they had intracellular and surface structures that appeared to be partially degraded organelles. The results indicate that maturation of circulating stress reticulocytes is enhanced by an extrinsic process that occurs in the spleen and involves macrophage activity. Complete loss of reticulin with incomplete loss of surface transferrin receptors in this process produces a reticulin-negative, transferrin receptor-positive erythrocyte population that has potential utility for detecting prior erythropoietic stresses including bleeding, hemolysis and erythropoietin administration, even after recovery has been completed.

### Flow cytometric analysis of reticulated platelets in patients with ischemic stroke [^114yHH8n]. Thrombosis Research (2002). Low credibility.

Reticulated platelets are newly formed platelets containing a residual amount of RNA, and percentage of reticulated platelets (%RP) has been shown to reflect platelet turnover. Recently, a new flow cytometric approach for analyzing %RP in patients with thrombocytopenic disorders has been reported. We measured %RP by flow cytometry using the fluorescent dye thiazole orange (TO) to evaluate platelet kinetics in patients with different clinical categories of ischemic stroke. Patients with ischemic stroke were categorized into lacunar (n = 25), atherothrombotic (n = 26) and cardioembolic stroke (n = 17). %RP was significantly higher in patients with cardioembolic stroke than in controls (n = 140). Stepwise multiple regression analysis also showed cardioembolic stroke (R(2) = 0.14) to be significant independent predictors of %RP among stroke patients even after adjustment for other factors. We concluded that %RP is increased in patients with cardioembolic stroke, which may reflect increased platelet turnover as a consequence of platelet consumption during thrombogenesis.

Impaired reticulocyte maturation and increased lipid peroxidation in Gpx4 -deficient erythroid cells and aggravation of the phenotype by vitamin E-depletion

Next, we attempted to define the maturation state of the reticulocytes in the anemic mice. To this end, peripheral blood cells were stained with CD71, Ter119, Mitotracker Deep Red, and thiazol orange. Representative examples of mice are depicted in Figure 5A-C (quantification of total numbers of mature, immature and highly immature reticulocytes in the Online Supplementary Figure S6A-F). Deletion of Gpx4 increased not only the total number of reticulocytes, but also that of each fraction: 2.1-fold of mature, 3.5-fold of immature, and 4.2-fold of highly immature reticulocytes (Online Supplementary Figure S6D-F). The differentially higher increase in more immature reticulocytes led to a general shift towards more immature reticulocytes. Under combined Gpx4 and vitamin E deficiency, the number of highly immature reticulocytes increased 7-fold, while the total number of mature reticulocytes decreased by 20%. The failure of reticulocytes to undergo maturation was associated with an increase in lipid peroxidation of reticulocytes and erythrocytes as revealed by Bodipy 581/591-C11-staining. Lipid peroxidation was particularly pronounced in immature reticulocytes when vitamin E was additionally depleted (Figure 5D).

### Mature erythrocyte indices: new markers of iron availability [^1158K38Y]. Haematologica (2005). Low credibility.

This study was aimed at evaluating mature erythrocyte indices as new markers of iron status. Contrarily to those in the whole red blood cell (RBC) population, mature erythrocyte parameters are valid markers of iron status that remain independent of erythropoietic activity. When reticulocytosis is low, these parameters are similar to whole RBC parameters.

Flow cytometry

Total BM cell isolation, antibody staining, and flow cytometry were performed as described previously. Peripheral blood was collected from the mice by facial vein bleeding into EDTA-treated tubesand the reticulocyte count was determined by thiazole orange staining followed by flow cytometry. The absolute number of reticulocytes in the peripheral blood was calculated for each mouse based on an estimated blood volume of 77 to 80 mL/kg (The Jackson Laboratory). The antibodies used for the flow cytometry are listed in supplemental Table 1. A standard curve of TdTomato clearance for erythroid kinetic analysis was established using an online tool from MyAssays Ltd.

### Emerging nucleic acid-based tests for point-of-care detection of malaria [^117757tm]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Malaria is one of the most serious of the diseases of poverty and is widespread across the developing world causing 200–500 million illnesses, and more than 1 million deaths each year.–Malaria accounts for up to 20% of all childhood deaths in Africa.–In many of the areas to which malaria is endemic, there is a lack of access to effective diagnostics, leading to poor surveillance of malaria infections and treatment, poor health outcomes for non-malarial fever patients, and a public lack of trust in the health system. In addition, over-prescription of cheap antimalarial drugs has led to development of widespread drug resistance, and drugs that remain effective, such as artemisinin-derived treatments, are much more expensive (approximately $1–$2 per day), leading to an increased need for accurate diagnosis before treatment.–Thus, there is a growing consensus that there is a need for new diagnostics that are more accessible in malaria-endemic areas, and that have improved performance over existing techniques to help guide the distribution of antimalarial drugs, to more effectively target the disease, and to reduce the generation of drug-resistant strains.

A major limitation of malaria diagnosis is that most cases occur in areas with limited health care infrastructure.–To be useful in these circumstances, a diagnostic should be low cost, require minimal or no external power, be able to be run on portable and easy to maintain equipment, be usable without extensive training, not require refrigerated reagent storage and deliver accurate and unambiguous results rapidly. The World Health Organization has established a set of principles to guide the development of diagnostics for these low-resource, point-of-care (POC) settings known as ASSURED. A test should be Affordable, Sensitive, Specific, User-friendly, Rapid and Robust, Equipment-free, and Deliverable to end-users. In addition, the ideal malaria diagnostic should be able to determine which species is infecting the patient, determine the level of infection (measured as parasitemia, the percentage of infected erythrocytes), and be capable of detecting low level infections.

### Role of reticulated platelets in cardiovascular disease [^112ayFwf]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2022). Medium credibility.

Human platelets differ considerably with regard to their size, RNA content and thrombogenicity. Reticulated platelets (RPs) are young, hyper-reactive platelets that are newly released from the bone marrow. They are larger and contain more RNA compared to older platelets. In comparison to more mature platelets, they exhibit a significantly higher thrombogenicity and are known to be elevated in patients with an increased platelet turnover such as, diabetics and after acute myocardial infarction. Several studies have shown that RPs correlate with an insufficient antiplatelet response to aspirin and specific P2Y 12 receptor inhibitors. In addition, RPs are promising novel biomarkers for the prediction of adverse cardiovascular events in cardiovascular disease. However, the reason for RPs intrinsic hyper-reactivity and their association with ischemic events is not completely understood and the biology of RPs is still under investigation. We here present a structured review of preclinical and clinical findings concerning the role of RPs in cardiovascular disease.

### DNA binding to TLR9 expressed by red blood cells promotes innate immune activation and anemia [^115YGcpE]. Science Translational Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Red blood cells (RBCs) are essential for aerobic respiration through delivery of oxygen to distant tissues. However, RBCs are currently considered immunologically inert, and few, if any, secondary functions of RBCs have been identified. Here, we showed that RBCs serve as critical immune sensors through surface expression of the nucleic acid–sensing Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9). Mammalian RBCs expressed TLR9 on their surface and bound CpG-containing DNA derived from bacteria, plasmodia, and mitochondria. RBC-bound mitochondrial DNA was increased during human and murine sepsis and pneumonia. In vivo, CpG-carrying RBCs drove accelerated erythrophagocytosis and innate immune activation characterized by increased interferon signaling. Erythroid-specific deletion of TLR9 abrogated erythrophagocytosis and decreased local and systemic cytokine production during CpG-induced inflammation and polymicrobial sepsis. Thus, detection and capture of nucleic acid by TLR9-expressing RBCs regulated red cell clearance and inflammatory cytokine production, demonstrating that RBCs function as immune sentinels during pathologic states. Consistent with these findings, RBC-bound mitochondrial DNA was elevated in individuals with viral pneumonia and sepsis secondary to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and associated with anemia and severity of disease. These findings uncover a previously unappreciated role of RBCs as critical players in inflammation distinct from their function in gas transport.

### Staining blood smears… [^114WXLg1]. CDC (2019). Medium credibility.

Blood Specimens – Staining Staining Blood Smears Stain only one set of smears, and leave the duplicates unstained. The latter will prove useful if a problem occurs during the staining and/or if you wish later to send the smears to a reference laboratory. Wright stain Used in hematology, this stain is not optimal for blood parasites. It can be used if rapid results are needed, but should be followed up when possible with a confirmatory Giemsa stain, so that Schüffner's dots can be demonstrated.
- Place slides into the working Giemsa stain for 45–60 minutes.
- Remove thin smear slides and rinse by dipping 3–4 times in the Giemsa buffer. Thick smears should be left in buffer for 5 minutes.
- Dry the slides upright in a rack. Note: As alternates to this 45–60 minutes in 2. 5% Giemsa stain, the smears could be stained for shorter times in more concentrated stains.

One alternate is 10 minutes in 10% Giemsa; the shorter stains yield faster results, but use more stain and might be of less predictable quality.
- Choose a patient blood specimen, anticoagulated with EDTA, that has enough parasites so that at least one is found in every 2 to 3 fields.
- Make as many thin smears as possible, preferably within one hour after the blood was drawn from the patient.
- Allow the smears to dry quickly, using a fan or blower at room temperature.
- Fix the smears in absolute methanol; allow them to dry.
- Place them, touching front to back, in a box without separating grooves.
- Label the outside of the box with the species, date and "Giemsa control slides. "
- Store at -70°C if the purpose is to make quality control slides.
- Just before use, remove the smear from the box and allow the condensation to evaporate; label the slide "+ malaria" and the present date. The smear is now ready for staining since it was previously fixed.

### The reticulocyte count in normal and in abnormal conditions… [^1139Wrzb]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Since the advent of vital staining, interest in the reticulocyte count as one index of regeneration of the blood has been much heightened. Among the earlier investigators to study reticulation was Ehrlich, 1 who by means of a dried blood film stained with a saturated solution of methylene blue, described nets in the red corpuscles in normal blood and in anemia. Twelve years later Askanazy2 noted a reticulated substance in the erythrocytes of a rapidly progressive anemia. In 1901, Levaditi3 began the use of a brilliant cresyl blue as a vital stain, but did not mention reticulation. From 1907 to 1913 much work was done on reticulation. A brief summary of these studies will be found in Cunningham's article. 4 In his own work Cunningham4 found that permanent preparations could be made by combining a vital stain with Wright's stain. He thought that the ease and simplicity. FRIEDLANDER A, WIEDEMER C.
