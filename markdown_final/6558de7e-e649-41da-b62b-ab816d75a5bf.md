## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking to interpret a cervical spine MRI showing degenerative changes greatest at C5–6, with focal severe central stenosis (R > L), cord compression, and a subtle myelopathic cord signal abnormality. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how these imaging elements fit within the framework of degenerative cervical myelopathy pathophysiology and epidemiology. Then, I should verify the prognostic weight of intramedullary T2 and T1 cord signal changes. Next, I will consider dynamic factors and the clinicoradiologic correlation to avoid overcalling incidental compression. After that, I need to outline management options, indications for surgery versus observation, and the preferred approach at C5–6. Finally, I will examine advanced imaging and intraoperative monitoring considerations, synthesize prognosis, and provide concrete, time-sensitive recommendations, while double-checking the evidence base at each step.

> Let me first confirm the disease construct and the role of MRI before I anchor on specifics. Degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) is the most common cause of adult spinal cord dysfunction, arising from age-related disc, osteophyte, and ligamentous changes that narrow the canal and chronically compress the cord; MRI is the modality of choice for defining canal compromise and intramedullary injury, and expeditious diagnosis and treatment are needed to avoid permanent disability [^1161pkAJ]. Hold on, I should verify the prognostic significance of T2 hyperintensity and T1 hypointensity because this will shape the downstream recommendations; conventional T2/T1 sequences remain central, with sharply demarcated or multilevel T2 hyperintensity and any concomitant T1 hypointensity generally portending worse outcomes, whereas subtle or postoperative-resolving T2 hyperintensity is associated with more favorable recovery potential [^1132Bf2m].

> Now, I will interpret the focal degenerative changes at C5–6. Let me think about biomechanics: C5–6 bears high motion and load, making it the most common level for spondylotic disc-osteophyte complexes and ligamentous hypertrophy, producing static canal narrowing that initiates DCM's mechanical injury cascade; single-level focal disease is often prognostically better than multilevel involvement, all else equal [^notfound]. I should confirm that this anatomic pattern aligns with the typical degenerative DCM substrate, which it does, including disc space narrowing and osteophytes that compress ventrally at the disc level [^1161pkAJ].

> Next, I will analyze the report of severe central stenosis with right-sided predominance. Initially, I was going to equate "severe" with an absolute mid-sagittal diameter less than 10 mm or a compression ratio ≤ 0.5; wait, let me verify the evidentiary basis for that cut point because definitions vary and population data emphasize association more than universal thresholds, with one study linking CDdisc < 9.9 mm to high odds of nonmyelopathic compression without necessarily dictating clinical severity, underscoring that anatomic severity alone correlates imperfectly with symptoms and functional impairment [^115mSw5r]. The right-greater-than-left asymmetry suggests a paramedian anterior source such as disc-osteophyte or uncovertebral hypertrophy producing lateralized cord impingement; but I need to ensure I consider dynamic effects as stenosis often worsens in extension via ligamentum flavum buckling and in flexion via ventral cord drape, so dynamic imaging or neurophysiology can unmask occult compression and tract dysfunction when neutral MRI seems discordant with exam [^1148XUKi] [^113fEa1o] [^111E9EDb].

> I will now evaluate the implications of frank cord compression. Mechanical deformation triggers secondary microvascular compromise, inflammation, and neuroglial injury, leading to demyelination and ultimately neuronal loss; however, I should double-check that the degree of static compression alone does not reliably predict postoperative outcome, as clinical severity and intrinsic cord signal characteristics tend to be more prognostic than raw canal dimensions [^1161pkAJ]. Let me reconsider how this should influence recommendations: it means I cannot rely on "severe stenosis" in isolation for prognosis and must weight the cord signal state and clinical trajectory more heavily when advising surgery timing and expectations [^111d5q3G].

> Deciphering the "subtle myelopathic cord signal abnormality" is pivotal. "Subtle" on T2-weighted imaging usually reflects a faint, fuzzy hyperintensity consistent with edema or gliosis rather than chronic cavitation, aligning with more reversible pathology and better outcomes than sharply marginated or multisegmental T2 hyperintensity; crucially, the absence of reported T1 hypointensity in this case is favorable because T1 hypointensity signals myelomalacia and reduced recovery potential [^1132Bf2m]. Wait, I should confirm there's truly no T1 change; since it wasn't mentioned, I will assume absent but note that if T1 hypointensity is later identified, prognosis would worsen and intraoperative neuromonitoring risk would increase, as combined T2/T1 abnormalities predict higher rates of IONM alerts and postoperative deficits [^114f6oS9]. I need to check whether quantitative measures have been described; indeed, a preoperative T2 signal change ratio (SCR) greater than 1.46 has been linked to poorer surgical outcomes, so "subtle" likely tracks with lower SCR and better prognosis, though objective quantification is ideal when available [^11773oRw].

> Synthesizing disease stage, I would cautiously classify this as DCM of likely moderate severity with preserved recovery potential, given single-level C5–6 disease, severe focal stenosis, and early-appearing T2 change without T1 hypointensity; hold on, I should verify that single-level focal signal is indeed more favorable than multisegmental involvement, which multiple series support, including data showing stepwise worse baseline severity and recovery with T1+T2 changes versus T2-only versus no signal [^notfound]. This staging aligns with the broader principle that earlier, less destructive cord signal patterns carry better chances of neurologic improvement after decompression [^1161pkAJ].

> Before management, I need to ensure clinical correlation. MRI-defined compression is common in older adults, and many have no clinical myelopathy; therefore, I should confirm signs such as hand clumsiness, gait imbalance, hyperreflexia, Hoffmann sign, or other long tract findings, and anchor the decision-making to mJOA or similar scales because imaging alone cannot establish DCM severity or the need for surgery in isolation [^115mSw5r]. I should double-check that this correlation-first principle is reflected in guidelines and cohort work emphasizing comprehensive clinical assessment alongside MRI as the standard diagnostic pathway in DCM [^111d5q3G].

> Turning to management, I will stratify by severity and progression. Surgical decompression is recommended for moderate to severe DCM, while the optimal strategy for mild, nonprogressive disease remains debated; nonoperative care for myelopathy risks neurologic decline in a substantial fraction over time, so close monitoring is essential if conservative therapy is chosen, and progression should prompt surgical referral [^1161pkAJ]. Wait, let me verify numbers for deterioration under nonoperative care; consensus suggests 20–62% decline by 3–6 years, which underscores the unpredictably progressive course and the narrow indications for prolonged conservative management in symptomatic DCM [^112TSoxC].

> For approach selection at single-level C5–6 with presumed anterior cord compression, an anterior procedure such as ACDF is typically preferred because it directly addresses ventral pathology and restores disc height and alignment; I need to ensure I do not overstate this, though, because posterior options can be appropriate if there is multilevel disease, dorsal compression, or alignment considerations such as lordosis maintenance or kyphosis correction needs, so surgical planning should integrate sagittal balance, compression location, and surgeon expertise [^115kMZw6]. Hold on, I initially thought a posterior approach was "not indicated" for isolated anterior single-level disease; that is generally true, but I should explicitly acknowledge exceptions where posterior decompression could still be chosen based on alignment or patient-specific constraints, to avoid an overly rigid recommendation [^111jJime].

> Timing matters because delaying decompression risks transition from reversible edema to irreversible myelomalacia. Let me verify outcome associations with the evolution of signal: persistence or evolution to T1 hypointensity after surgery correlates with worse functional outcomes, whereas resolution of T2 hyperintensity in a subset links to better recovery, supporting the case for timely intervention before chronic changes supervene [^112vJ8Qn]. I should also note that intraoperative and early postoperative imaging studies demonstrate that some T2 signal can regress even immediately or within months after adequate decompression, reinforcing the value of early surgery when appropriate [^117DFT2P].

> I will now examine advanced imaging and perioperative risk tools that could refine decisions. Diffusion tensor imaging and MR spectroscopy can detect microstructural and metabolic injury not captured by conventional sequences, and dynamic flexion-extension diffusion metrics can unmask position-dependent cord distress, aiding diagnosis and severity grading when conventional MRI is equivocal or symptoms are disproportionate to static imaging [^117AcMTy]. Let me double-check the dynamic biomarker evidence; multicenter work supports diffusion parameter changes with neck motion in DCM and distinguishes patients with and without visible T2 hyperintensity, suggesting real clinical utility where available [^111E9EDb]. I should also confirm that preoperative combined T2/T1 signal change increases the likelihood of IONM alerts and postoperative deficits, which can guide intraoperative preparedness and counseling [^114f6oS9].

> Prognostically, several favorable predictors are present here: single-level disease, subtle T2 hyperintensity without T1 hypointensity, and a pattern consistent with edema or gliosis rather than necrosis, all of which are associated with greater likelihood of neurological improvement after decompression; I need to ensure I temper expectations because outcomes still depend on baseline severity and symptom duration [^1132Bf2m]. Registry and multicenter cohorts show clinically meaningful improvements after surgery for DCM across severities, but a stepwise worse recovery with persistent or combined signal abnormalities, supporting realistic yet optimistic counseling in this scenario [^114RvLNn] [^112vJ8Qn].

> Putting this together, my radiological impression is symptomatic, focal DCM at C5–6 with severe central stenosis, right-predominant anterior compression, and early, potentially reversible intramedullary signal change consistent with moderate disease and a favorable surgical prognosis if clinical myelopathy is confirmed; I should confirm the neurological examination and mJOA to stage severity formally and track outcomes [^111d5q3G]. If clinical signs are present or progression is documented, I would recommend timely anterior decompression and fusion at C5–6, with preoperative optimization, counseling about risks including adjacent segment pathology over time, and plans for postoperative imaging at 6–12 months to evaluate decompression adequacy and signal evolution, adjusting expectations if T2 persists or T1 hypointensity emerges [^116f2fvi] [^117DFT2P] [^112vJ8Qn].

The MRI shows **severe central canal stenosis at C5-C6** with **right-dominant cord compression** and **subtle T2 cord signal abnormality**, consistent with early degenerative cervical myelopathy [^1161pkAJ]. This pattern reflects mechanical cord injury with early edema or demyelination [^1132Bf2m]. The right-greater-than-left asymmetry suggests more pronounced right-sided symptoms. Given the severity of stenosis and the cord signal change, **surgical decompression is recommended** to prevent progression and stabilize or improve neurologic function [^114RvLNn] [^114mGYrE].

---

## MRI findings and clinical correlation

- **Degenerative changes at C5-C6**: Degenerative disc disease, osteophytes, and ligamentous hypertrophy are typical at C5-C6 [^115kMZw6] and can cause significant canal narrowing and cord compression.

- **Severe central canal stenosis**: Severe stenosis reduces canal diameter, compressing the cord and causing neurologic deficits such as weakness, sensory loss, gait instability, and sphincter dysfunction [^1161pkAJ].

- **Right-dominant cord compression**: Asymmetric compression often produces more pronounced right-sided symptoms, including weakness, sensory changes, and hyperreflexia.

- **Subtle myelopathic cord signal abnormality**: T2 hyperintensity indicates early cord edema or demyelination from chronic compression, correlating with myelopathy severity and prognosis [^1132Bf2m].

---

## Clinical implications and prognosis

- **Progression of neurological deficits**: Without treatment, chronic cord compression can cause progressive myelopathy, including weakness, sensory loss, gait instability, and sphincter dysfunction [^112TSoxC].

- **Prognostic significance of MRI findings**: T2 hyperintensity reflects early cord injury and is associated with worse baseline severity and reduced recovery potential, especially if multilevel or combined with T1 hypointensity [^1132Bf2m].

- **Risk of permanent neurological impairment**: Persistent compression with cord signal change increases the risk of irreversible deficits if not promptly addressed [^115kMZw6].

---

## Recommended management strategies

- **Surgical decompression**: Surgery is the standard of care for moderate-to-severe myelopathy [^114mGYrE] or progressive deficits, aiming to halt progression and improve function [^1161pkAJ].

- **Timing of surgery**: Early decompression is recommended to prevent irreversible cord injury and optimize outcomes [^114RvLNn].

- **Surgical approach**: Anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) is often preferred for focal anterior compression at C5-C6 [^115kMZw6], while posterior approaches may be considered for multilevel or posterior disease [^111jJime].

- **Postoperative rehabilitation**: Structured rehabilitation is essential to maximize functional recovery and quality of life.

---

## Potential complications and risks

Delayed or inadequate treatment can cause **neurological deterioration**, with worsening myelopathy and permanent deficits. Surgery carries risks such as **infection, bleeding, nerve injury, and adjacent segment disease** [^116f2fvi]; however, in severe myelopathy, the **benefits generally outweigh these risks** [^114RvLNn]. Some patients may experience persistent or recurrent symptoms due to irreversible cord injury or ongoing degeneration [^112vJ8Qn].

---

## Summary and recommendations

The MRI demonstrates severe right-dominant central canal stenosis at C5-C6 with cord compression and subtle T2 signal change, consistent with early degenerative cervical myelopathy [^1161pkAJ]. Prompt **surgical decompression** is recommended to prevent progression and improve neurologic function, with ACDF often preferred for focal anterior compression [^115kMZw6]. Early intervention and rehabilitation are critical to optimize outcomes and reduce the risk of permanent impairment.

The radiological assessment in degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) remains challenging and requires further improvement due to the restricted correlation between imaging alterations and the clinical severity of affected patients, as well as its controversial prognostic utilization. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the modality of choice because it offers the highest tissue resolution and increasingly advanced measurements to characterize spinal cord function.

Conventional T1- and T2-weighted sequences are routinely applied for characterizing the anatomical configuration of the spinal canal and the compression of neuronal tissue, as well as for pathological intramedullary signal alterations. Hyperintensities within the spinal cord on T2-weighted images and hypointensities on T1-weighted images are associated with obvious clinical myelopathy. Their occurrence is prognostically relevant and predominantly associated with poor clinical outcomes, with or without surgical therapy, especially in sharply delineated ("snake-eye") or multilevel T2 signal increases, and when T2 and T1 myelopathy signs occur combined.

In contrast, slightly blurry delineated or postoperatively disappearing T2 hyperintensities are postulated to have better clinical outcomes than the aforementioned intramedullary signal aberrations. The character of the intramedullary signal change seems to reflect progressive tissue destruction in DCM, starting with an intramedullary edema, local demyelination, and ending with necrosis and spinal cord atrophy.

### Degenerative cervical myelopathy - update and future directions [^1161pkAJ]. Nature Reviews Neurology (2020). High credibility.

Degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) is the leading cause of spinal cord dysfunction in adults worldwide. DCM encompasses various acquired (age-related) and congenital pathologies related to degeneration of the cervical spinal column, including hypertrophy and/or calcification of the ligaments, intervertebral discs, and osseous tissues. These pathologies narrow the spinal canal, leading to chronic spinal cord compression and disability. Owing to the aging population, rates of DCM are increasing. Expeditious diagnosis and treatment of DCM are needed to avoid permanent disability.

Over the past 10 years, advances in basic science and in translational and clinical research have improved our understanding of the pathophysiology of DCM and helped delineate evidence-based practices for diagnosis and treatment. Surgical decompression is recommended for moderate and severe DCM; the best strategy for mild myelopathy remains unclear. Next-generation quantitative microstructural MRI and neurophysiological recordings promise to enable quantification of spinal cord tissue damage and help predict clinical outcomes.

This comprehensive, evidence-based review of DCM includes its definition, epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis and differential diagnosis, and non-operative and operative management. With this review, we aim to equip physicians across broad disciplines with the knowledge necessary to make a timely diagnosis of DCM, recognize the clinical features that influence management, and identify when urgent surgical intervention is warranted.

### Surgery for degenerative cervical myelopathy: A nationwide registry-based observational study with patient-reported outcomes [^114RvLNn]. Neurosurgery (2021). High credibility.

Degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) is a progressive spine disorder and the most common cause of spinal cord impairment in adults over 55 years. The cervical spine is prone to degenerative changes such as disk herniation, ligament hypertrophy or ossification, and osteophyte formation that may lead to spinal cord compression and dysfunction. DCM should be considered in patients over 50 years with progressive neurological symptoms, such as pain and stiffness in the neck, pain and numbness in the limbs, poor coordination, imbalance, loss of dexterity, frequent falls, and bowel and/or urinary incontinence.

As the nonspecific and subtle initial features of DCM overlap with other neurological conditions, diagnosing the disorder early can be challenging. Lack of awareness and incomplete neurological assessments can also delay diagnosis, increasing the risk of developing lifelong disability and impaired quality of life. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the investigation of choice to detect spinal cord compression with or without intramedullary signal abnormalities, and electrophysiologic testing can sometimes help exclude alternative diagnoses. Incidental degenerative changes in the cervical spine with spinal cord compression are commonly encountered on MRI and do not correlate well with the severity of symptoms.

As the oldest sector of the population continues to grow and wishes to remain active, physicians will be required to manage an increasing number of patients with degenerative changes in the spine and DCM.

### Diagnostic role of flexion-extension central motor conduction time in cervical spondylotic myelopathy [^113fEa1o]. Spine (2021). Low credibility.

Based on our results, we have identified that neck motions — flexion and extension — increase cervical cord compression in terms of neurophysiology. This finding supports previous studies on dynamic MRI, which insist that the spinal canal narrowing worsens during neck flexion. Our discovery is also evidenced by the MRI findings in this study. Furthermore, our finding implies that neck movement provokes either temporary or continuous cervical cord compression in CSM patients. Cord impingement due to repeated neck motions causes symptoms to progress and worsen gradually.

Numerous studies have described the mechanisms causing spinal canal stenosis and cord compression due to neck motions. Most space-occupying lesions due to cervical degeneration occur anterior to the cervical cord. Diseases such as disc protrusion, OPLL, vertebral osteophyte, and retrolisthesis can cause an increase in mechanical compression of the spinal canal and the cervical cord during neck flexion. Meanwhile, during neck extension, spinal canal narrowing becomes prominent, and the spinal cord shifts forward. These changes increase the pressure on the spinal canal due to the aforementioned anterior cervical lesions. Furthermore, most CSM patients experience thickening of the ligamentum flavum and facet joint hypertrophy, which are common causes of increased pressure on the spinal canal and the cervical cord during neck extension. Microvascular injury is another mechanism for explaining cord injury caused by repeated neck movement. Cervical cord stretching occurs during neck flexion.

### The evolution of T2-weighted intramedullary signal changes following ventral decompressive surgery for cervical spondylotic myelopathy: Clinical article [^113sZTNg]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine (2014). Low credibility.

T2-weighted intramedullary increased signal intensity (ISI) on MRI in patients with cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM) appears to represent a wide spectrum of pathological changes that determine reversibility of cord damage. Although sharp T2-weighted ISI on preoperative imaging may correlate with poorer surgical outcomes, there are limited data on how these changes progress following surgery. In this study, the authors characterized pre-and postoperative ISI changes in patients undergoing surgery for CSM and studied their postoperative evolution in an attempt to quantify their clinical significance.

- **Methods**: The preoperative and postoperative MR images obtained in 56 patients who underwent oblique cervical corpectomy for CSM were reviewed, and the ISI was classified into four subtypes based on margins and intensity: Type 0 (none), Type 1 ("fuzzy"), Type 2 ("sharp"), and Type 3 ("mixed"). The locations of the ISI were further classified as focal if they represented single discrete lesions, multifocal if there were multiple lesions with intervening normal cord, and multisegmental if the lesions were continuous over more than one segment. The maximum craniocaudal length of the ISI was measured on each midsagittal MR image. The Nurick grade and Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) score were used to assess clinical status. The mean duration of follow-up was 28 months.

- **Results**: T2-weighted ISI changes were noted preoperatively in 54 patients (96%). Most preoperative ISI changes were Type 1 (41%) or Type 3 (34%), with a significant trend toward Type 2 (71%) changes at

For patients with spinal cord injury without radiographic abnormality, particularly concerning cervical spine injuries, the AANS/CNS 2013 guidelines recommend obtaining flexion-extension radiographs in the acute setting and during late follow-up.

### Prevalence and imaging characteristics of nonmyelopathic and myelopathic spondylotic cervical cord compression [^115mSw5r]. Spine (2016). Low credibility.

This study is a cross-sectional population-based observational study designed to estimate the prevalence of nonmyelopathic spondylotic cervical cord compression (NMSCCC) and cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM) in individuals older than 40 years. It also aims to evaluate the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) characteristics of these conditions. The prevalence of both NMSCCC and CSM is currently unknown, and there is no widely accepted quantitative MRI definition for cervical cord compression.

A total of 183 randomly recruited volunteers, consisting of 93 women with a median age of 66 years (range 40–80 years), underwent MRI examination of the cervical spine and spinal cord. These examinations were conducted using a 1.5 T device, employing conventional sequences from disc levels C2/C3 to C6/C7. The imaging criterion for cervical cord compression was defined as a change in the spinal cord contour at the level of an intervertebral disc on an axial or sagittal MRI scan.

MRI signs of cervical cord compression were identified in 108 individuals (59.0%; 95% CI: 51.5%-66.2%), with prevalence increasing with age from 31.6% in the fifth decade to 66.8% in the eighth decade. Symptomatic CSM was clinically evident in two cases (1.1%), while 75 cases (41.0%) showed no compression. A decrease in anteroposterior cervical canal diameter at the level of an intervertebral disc (CDdisc) to less than 9.9 mm was associated with the highest probability of NMSCCC, with an odds ratio (OR) of 32.5. This was followed by a compression ratio of ≤ 0.5 with an OR of 11.1.

In conclusion, the prevalence of NMSCCC in a population older than 40 years is higher than previously reported and shows an increase with advancing age.

Spinal or cervical cord compression with resultant myelopathy is a known and serious complication of MPS VI. It is expected to occur in the natural history of the disease, including in patients on Naglazyme. There have been postmarketing reports of patients treated with Naglazyme who experienced the onset or worsening of spinal or cervical cord compression, necessitating decompression surgery.

Patients with MPS VI should be monitored for signs and symptoms of spinal or cervical cord compression, such as back pain, paralysis of limbs below the level of compression, and urinary and fecal incontinence, and should be provided with appropriate clinical care.

### Automated signal intensity analysis of the spinal cord for detection of degenerative cervical myelopathy - a matched-pair MRI study [^115kcHih]. Neuroradiology (2023). Low credibility.

Figure 1 provides an overview of the post-processing procedure, featuring 3D spinal cord segmentation and generation of the T2-SI curve from C2 to C7, conducted slice-by-slice for a patient with spinal stenosis at the C5/6 level without intramedullary T2 hyperintensities. To compare specific cervical segments, the mean, standard deviation (SD), and range of the T2-SI were calculated from the center of the upper cervical body to the lower cervical body.

Representing the extent of T2-SI variability, we introduced the "T2 myelopathy index" (T2-MI) as a new parameter. It is defined as the percentage of the T2-SI range relative to the mean absolute T2-SI within each cervical segment. The complete post-processing, which includes segmentation, T2-SI curve generation, and computation of the evaluated parameters, takes approximately 3 minutes.

- **Subjective categorization of T2 hyperintensities**: To define the ground truth, the presence of T2 hyperintensity within the spinal cord was evaluated in each cervical level from C2 to C7. Each MRI scan received five ratings for levels C2/3, C3/4, C4/5, C5/6, and C6/7. All segments were classified as "T2-positive" if a hyperintensity was observed, or "T2-negative" if it was not. To enhance reliability, three independent, blinded, experienced observers each with at least 10 years of experience in spinal MRI evaluation, conducted the categorization. The observers' agreement was assessed using Fleiss' kappa statistics.

### Do intramedullary spinal cord changes in signal intensity on MRI affect surgical opportunity and approach for cervical myelopathy due to ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament [^117GRWyn]. European Spine Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Some controversy still exists over the optimal treatment time and the surgical approach for cervical myelopathy due to ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL). The aim of the study was to analyze the effect of intramedullary spinal cord changes in signal intensity (hyperintensity on T2-weighted imaging and hypointensity on T1-weighted imaging) on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) on surgical opportunity and approach for cervical myelopathy due to OPLL. This was a prospective randomized controlled study. Fifty-six patients with cervical myelopathy due to OPLL were enrolled and assigned to either group A (receiving anterior decompression and fusion, n = 27) or group P (receiving posterior laminectomy, n = 29). All the patients were followed up for an average of 20.3 months (12–34 months). The clinical outcomes were assessed by the average operative time, blood loss, Japanese Orthopedic Association (JOA) score, improvement rate (IR), and complication.

To determine the relevant statistics, we made two factorial designs and regrouped the data of all patients into group H (with hyperintensity on MRI, n = 31), group L (with hypointensity on MRI, n = 19) and group N (no signal on MRI, n = 25). Further, we created six subgroups: AH (with hyperintensity on MRI from group A, n = 15), PH (with hyperintensity on MRI from group P, n = 16), AL (with hypointensity on MRI from group A, n = 10), PL (with hypointensity on MRI from group P, n = 9), AN (no signal intensity on MRI from group A, n = 12) and PN (no signal intensity on MRI from group P, n = 13).

### Spinal involvement in mucopolysaccharidosis IVA (Morquio-Brailsford or Morquio A syndrome): presentation, diagnosis and management [^112YBz5T]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2013). Low credibility.

- **Spinal cord compression**: In MPS IVA, spinal cord compression may occur in the upper cervical, cervicothoracic, and thoracolumbar regions. Aetiological factors include ligamentous thickening from GAGs and fibrocartilaginous tissue accumulation, cervical instability, cartilaginous and ligamentous hypertrophy at the atlantoaxial joint, and thickening of the posterior longitudinal ligament in the sub-axial spine, thoracic, and lumbar spine. Additional factors include acquired central canal stenosis, disc protrusion, and thoracolumbar kyphosis. A stenotic spinal canal, or a combination of stenosis and instability, may predict spinal cord compression. Direct measurement by MRI is necessary to confirm compression, assess severity, and identify cord injury. Spinal stenosis with loss of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow on MRI signifies spinal cord compression. Untreated compression can lead to cord damage and myelopathy.

	- Myelomalacia is best depicted by T2-weighted MRI in the sagittal and axial planes, where an increase in T2 signal with volume loss in regions of cord compression is diagnostic. T2 hyperintensity without atrophy suggests edema due to contusion or microvascular injury. These changes may be more apparent after surgical decompression.

### Systematic correlation of transcranial magnetic stimulation and magnetic resonance imaging in cervical spondylotic myelopathy [^116q713A]. Spine (2004). Low credibility.

A prospective study was conducted over a 3.5-year period, involving transcranial magnetic stimulation and magnetic resonance imaging.

- **Objectives**: To assess the correlation of transcranial magnetic stimulation and magnetic resonance imaging in cervical spondylotic myelopathy both qualitatively and statistically.

- **Summary of background data**: Cervical spondylotic myelopathy presents with varying degrees of cord compression, which can be assessed by magnetic resonance imaging. There are no large studies correlating transcranial magnetic stimulation and magnetic resonance imaging findings in this condition.

- **Methods**: A total of 141 patients with a clinical diagnosis of cervical spondylotic myelopathy were prospectively studied over a 3.5-year period. They were classified into Groups 1 to 4 based on the severity of cervical cord changes observed on magnetic resonance imaging. All patients underwent transcranial magnetic stimulation and central motor conduction time measurements within two months of the magnetic resonance imaging study.

- **Results**: Twenty-eight, 49, 28, and 36 patients were classified into Groups 1 to 4, respectively. The mean upper limb and lower limb central motor conduction times correlated with the severity of magnetic resonance cord compression. The absence of central motor conduction time abnormalities reliably correlated with the absence of cervical cord impingement, as seen in Group 1. A statistically significant right-left difference in central motor conduction time in the lower limbs was observed between Groups 1 (no cord changes) and Group 2 (mild cord impingement). Eight other patients with diagnoses of…

The patient's chronic axial mechanical neck pain and bilateral upper extremity radiculopathy correlated with the degenerative and stenotic segments from C3 through C7. The pruritus was possibly caused by compression of the nerve roots and/or spinal cord at the affected levels. Given his multiyear history of multimodal conservative therapies and correlation between imaging and physical examination, it was thought that surgical intervention in the form of an anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) from C3 to C7 would provide the patient permanent relief from his pain and pruritus. The surgical decision was made to address all levels with notable spinal and foraminal stenosis since they might have potentially contributed to the patient's symptoms. An anterior approach was selected based on the patient's radiographic features (including multilevel foraminal stenosis) and clinical symptoms, in addition to the treating surgeon's good experience and familiarity with multilevel ACDF. The planned procedure was conducted without complication.

After surgery, the patient's symptoms improved instantly. At his most recent visit four months postoperatively, the patient reported a 95% improvement in his preoperative symptoms.

### Automated signal intensity analysis of the spinal cord for detection of degenerative cervical myelopathy - a matched-pair MRI study [^1126sNtn]. Neuroradiology (2023). Low credibility.

Detection of T2 hyperintensities in suspected degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) is done subjectively in clinical practice. To gain objective quantification for dedicated treatment, signal intensity analysis of the spinal cord is purposeful. We investigated fully automated quantification of the T2 signal intensity (T2-SI) of the spinal cord using a high-resolution MRI segmentation.

- **Methods**: Matched-pair analysis of prospective acquired cervical 3D T2-weighted sequences of 114 symptomatic patients and 88 healthy volunteers. The cervical spinal cord was segmented automatically through a trained convolutional neuronal network with subsequent T2-SI registration slice-by-slice. Received T2-SI curves were subdivided for each cervical level from C2 to C7. Additionally, all levels were subjectively classified concerning a present T2 hyperintensity. For T2-positive levels, corresponding T2-SI curves were compared to curves of age-matched volunteers at the identical level.

- **Results**: Forty-nine patients showed subjective T2 hyperintensities at any level. The corresponding T2-SI curves showed higher signal variabilities reflected by standard deviation (18.51 vs. 7.47 a.u.; p < 0.001) and range (56.09 vs. 24.34 a.u.; p < 0.001) compared to matched controls. Percentage of the range from the mean absolute T2-SI per cervical level, introduced as "T2 myelopathy index" (T2-MI), was correspondingly significantly higher in T2-positive segments (23.99% vs. 10.85%; p < 0.001). ROC analysis indicated excellent differentiation for all three parameters (AUC 0.865–0.920).

### A new minimally invasive posterior approach for the treatment of cervical radiculopathy and myelopathy: Surgical technique and preliminary results [^111V9PgX]. European Spine Journal (2003). Low credibility.

Degenerative cervical disorders predominantly lead to anterior spinal cord compression by bony spurs at the posterior margin of the vertebral body or by degenerated disc, which may be central and/or foraminal. In a smaller percentage of cases, encroachment of the canal occurs mainly from posterior bulging yellow ligaments or bony appositions, resulting in compression syndromes of roots or spinal cord. The aim of this work is to present a minimally invasive posterior approach to avoid detachment of muscles for the treatment of cervical radiculopathy and myelopathy. Thirteen patients suffering from cervical radiculopathy (four patients) or myelopathy (nine patients) were operated on according to this technique.

In principle, the technique secures access to the diseased spinal segment via a percutaneously placed working channel, measuring 11 mm in outer diameter and 9 mm in inner diameter. The cervical paraspinal muscles are not deflected but are instead spread between their fibres by special dilators. All further steps are performed through this channel under the control of three-dimensional vision through the operating microscope. The mean follow-up period was 17 months (one patient died 9 months postoperatively). Patients were evaluated using a modified version of the Oswestry Index, called the Neck Disability Index (NDI), and the visual analogue scale (VAS) for neck and arm pain. The mean NDI (P < 0.0001) improved from 13.2 preoperatively to 4.8 postoperatively. The VAS for arm pain (P < 0.001) and for neck pain (P < 0.001) also showed marked postoperative improvement.

### Clinical and radiological correlates of severity and surgery-related outcome in cervical spondylosis [^112FTZYK]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2001). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to determine if radiological features could predict outcomes in patients with cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM).

The authors studied 69 patients consecutively referred to The National Hospital, Queen Square, for decompressive surgery. Data obtained from preoperative cervical spine magnetic resonance (MR) imaging studies were each analyzed on two separate occasions by two blinded radiologists. The parameters determined were signal change and the presence and severity of compression. Clinical outcome was determined by pre- and postoperative timed walks, as well as by evaluation of myelopathy disability index scores, Ranawat classification, and Nurick grades. There was good inter- and intraobserver reliability for the determination of radiological data.

A significant relationship was found between MR imaging signal change and surgery-related outcome, as reflected by improvement in walking parameters; however, this was confounded by the fact that signal change also related to preoperative walking parameters, and those patients for whom preoperative walking function was worse experienced greater functional improvement in walking postoperatively. The relationships between ambulatory-related data and severity or extent of spinal cord compression were less marked.

Cervical cord compression and intrinsic MR imaging signal change correlate with clinical severity, and, in this population, the presence of signal change was correlated with better surgery-related outcome. However, confounding factors and the lack of stro

### Symptomatic progression of cervical myelopathy and the role of nonsurgical management: a consensus statement [^112TSoxC]. Spine (2013). Low credibility.

This section of the cervical spondylotic myelopathy spine focus issue collates the existing evidence related to natural history and nonoperative management. In the case of patients with symptomatic cervical spondylotic myelopathy treated nonoperatively, while 20% to 62% will deteriorate at 3 to 6 years of follow-up, no specific patient or disease characteristics have been shown to predict this change reliably. For patients without myelopathy with spondylotic cord compression, the rate of myelopathy development is approximately 8% at 1 year and approximately 23% at 4 years of follow-up. Clinical and/or electrophysiological evidence of cervical radiculopathy has been shown to predict such progression and should prompt strong consideration of surgical decompression.

With respect to nonoperative care, in the case of mild myelopathy, there is low evidence that such treatment may have a role. For moderate and severe myelopathy, this treatment results in outcomes inferior to those of surgery and is not recommended. Given the unpredictably progressive nature of cervical myelopathy, the indications for nonoperative management are ostensibly limited. Finally, the preclinical rationale and clinical translation of a putative neuroprotective drug, which may one day serve to augment the effects of surgery in the treatment of cervical spondylotic myelopathy, is presented and discussed.

### Long-term surgical outcome and risk factors in patients with cervical myelopathy and a change in signal intensity of intramedullary spinal cord on magnetic resonance imaging [^111GkpAu]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine (2010). Low credibility.

The goal of this study was to determine the long-term clinical significance and the risk factors associated with intramedullary signal intensity changes on MR images in patients with cervical compression myelopathy (CCM). This condition is most commonly associated with cervical spondylotic myelopathy and ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL).

One hundred seventy-four patients with CCM, but without cervical disc herniation or severe OPLL (where the cervical canal is ≥ 15 degrees of cervical kyphosis) who underwent surgery were initially selected. Of these, one hundred eight patients were followed for more than 36 months. Seventy-one of these patients, who agreed to MR imaging examinations both pre- and postsurgery, were enrolled in the study, with a mean follow-up duration of 60.6 months. All patients underwent cervical laminoplasty. The Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) score and recovery ratio were utilized to evaluate pre- and postoperative outcomes. The study examined multifactorial effects of variables such as age, sex, a history of smoking, diabetes mellitus, duration of symptoms, postoperative expansion of the high signal intensity area of the spinal cord on MR imaging, sagittal arrangement of the cervical spine, presence of ventral spinal cord compression, and presence of an unstable cervical spine.

Change in intramedullary signal intensity was observed in 50 of the 71 patients preoperatively. The pre- and postoperative JOA scores and the recovery ratio were significantly lower in patients with signal intensity changes on MR imaging.

### Prognostic relevance of the postoperative evolution of intramedullary spinal cord changes in signal intensity on magnetic resonance imaging after anterior decompression for cervical spondylotic myelopathy [^117DFT2P]. Journal of Neurosurgery. Spine (2007). Low credibility.

Areas of intramedullary signal intensity changes (hypointensity on T1-weighted magnetic resonance [MR] images and hyperintensity on T2-weighted MR images) in patients with cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM) have been described by several investigators. The role of postoperative evolution of these alterations is still not well known.

- **Methods**: A total of 47 patients underwent MR imaging before and at the end of the surgical procedure (intraoperative MR imaging [iMRI]) for cervical spine decompression and fusion using an anterior approach. Imaging was performed with a 1.5-tesla scanner integrated with the operative room (BrainSuite). Patients were followed clinically and evaluated using the Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) and Nurick scales and also underwent MR imaging 3 and 6 months after surgery.

- **Results**: Preoperative MR imaging showed an alteration (from the normal) of the intramedullary signal in 37 (78.7%) of 47 cases. In 23 cases, signal changes were altered on both T1- and T2-weighted images, and in 14 cases only on T2-weighted images. In 12 (52.2%) of the 23 cases, regression of hyperintensity on T2-weighted imaging was observed postoperatively. In 4 (17.4%) of these 23 cases, regression of hyperintensity was observed during the iMRI at the end of surgery. Residual compression on postoperative iMRI was not detected in any patients. A nonsignificant correlation was observed between postoperative expansion of the transverse diameter of the spinal cord at the level of maximal compression and the postoperative JOA score and Nurick grade.

### Cervical spondylotic myelopathy due to chronic compression: The role of signal intensity changes in magnetic resonance images [^115GZzKb]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine (2007). Low credibility.

Although there is agreement that low-intensity signal changes on T1-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) images are a prognostic factor for poor outcome after surgical treatment of cervical myelopathy due to chronic cord compression, the role of high-intensity signal changes on T2-weighted images is still controversial. The aim of the present study was to determine whether T2-weighted MR imaging can help assess the prognosis of the disease.

- **Methods**: A prospective case series study was conducted. The population comprised 67 patients who underwent surgery between 1994 and 2004 to treat myelopathy caused by chronic cervical cord compression. The mean follow-up period was 39 months. Preoperative and postoperative functional status was evaluated using a modified Japanese Orthopaedic Association scale, and the recovery rate was calculated using the Hirabayashi method. Magnetic resonance images were acquired 3 months or less before surgery. High-intensity signal changes were evaluated according to the extent of these changes on T2-weighted sequences; low-intensity T1-weighted signal changes were also evaluated. In patients with low-intensity changes on T1-weighted images and in those with high-intensity changes spanning multiple levels on T2-weighted images, the authors documented a poor functional recovery.

- **Conclusions**: Multisegmental high-intensity change on T2-weighted MR imaging is a more sensitive indicator of outcomes than T1-weighted signal changes because of its higher frequency in patients with advanced myelopathy.

### Location, length, and enhancement: Systematic approach to differentiating intramedullary spinal cord lesions [^115ZeMn3]. Insights into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

A common cause of weakness and sensory deficits in older patients is cervical compressive myelopathy or myelopathic spondylosis. This condition can occur secondary to spondylotic changes in the cervical spine and, less commonly, because of congenital abnormalities. The mechanism of injury involves decreased canal diameter and spinal stenosis, resulting in focal signal abnormality within the affected cord. Ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) is a common contributor. Compressive myelopathy typically demonstrates focal T2 hyperintensity in the cord at the level of spinal stenosis (at the level of a disc), with or without associated enhancement.

- **Compressive myelopathy example**: A 50-year-old patient with bilateral hand tingling. The sagittal T2 image shows severe spinal canal narrowing at C3–C4 due to degenerative changes, with focal faint signal hyperintensity (arrow). The post-contrast image shows focal enhancement (arrow).

- **Hirayama disease**: This is a disease primarily affecting young males, mostly recognized in Japan and India, presenting with unilateral upper extremity weakness. The disease is related to a lax dura mater, which changes position with flexion and extension. Resulting repetitive circulatory changes in the anterior spinal artery due to cord compression cause atrophy and eventual necrosis in the anterior horns. MRI plays an essential role in diagnosing this rare disease. Neutral cervical spine images are not very sensitive in showing the pertinent changes.

### Update on the diagnosis and management of cervical spondylotic myelopathy [^115kMZw6]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2015). High credibility.

Spondylotic degeneration in the cervical spine can lead to static and/or dynamic spinal cord compression, resulting in the signs and symptoms of myelopathy. Clinical examination combined with appropriate imaging studies helps to confirm the diagnosis. Classic natural history and basic science studies suggest a pernicious course of demyelination and neurologic decline in a large subset of patients. The characterization of disease severity and progression in patients with cervical spondylotic myelopathy has improved in recent years with imaging and data from prospective and multicenter studies.

Additionally, advances in surgical techniques, implants, and imaging modalities have enhanced the identification of surgical candidates with cervical spondylotic myelopathy and have refined associated treatment strategies. Surgical treatment, via an anterior, posterior, or combined approach, is primarily intended to arrest neurologic progression, although it can improve function in many patients. Alignment, as well as the characteristics and location of spinal cord compression, help determine the ideal surgical approach. Distinct complications are associated with each technique and may be mitigated by appropriate patient selection. These should be discussed preoperatively to ensure informed decision-making.

### Proposing a framework to understand the role of imaging in degenerative cervical myelopathy: Enhancement of MRI protocols needed for accurate diagnosis and evaluation [^112H5FTc]. Spine (2022). Low credibility.

In degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM), cervical spine imaging, particularly MRI, is essential for diagnosis and is not optional, as spinal canal narrowing is a prerequisite for spinal cord compression. However, given the high prevalence of patients with asymptomatic spinal canal stenosis, the strong interrelation of degenerative features, and the challenges of correlating clinical and radiological findings, we advocate that spinal canal narrowing alone does not suffice to make the diagnosis of DCM. An accurate diagnostic approach will thus need to define other characteristics, such as signs and symptoms, that permit a final diagnosis when cervical canal narrowing is present on MRI. In addition, differential diagnoses, for example, multiple sclerosis and tumors, should be ruled out with MRI (Figure 1E).

### High-resolution magnetic resonance imaging and 18FDG-PET findings of the cervical spinal cord before and after decompressive surgery in patients with compressive myelopathy [^114hDXia]. Spine (2009). Low credibility.

Evaluation of the cervical spinal cord (CSC) in patients with compressive myelopathy was conducted using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and high-resolution (18F)fluoro-deoxyglucose (18FDG) positron emission tomography (PET). The objective was to determine changes in morphology, intramedullary signal intensity, and glucose metabolic rate in the CSC after decompression, as well as to assess the utility of 18FDG-PET in evaluating patients with cervical myelopathy. The significance of CSC enlargement after decompression and signal intensity changes within the cord remain elusive. No data are available on the metabolic activity of the compressed CSC. Only a few studies have examined the correlation between high-resolution MRI and 18FDG-PET neuroimaging in cervical myelopathy.

We studied 24 patients who underwent cervical decompressive surgery in terms of postoperative neurologic improvement and changes in MRI and 18FDG-PET. Neurologic status was assessed by the Japanese Orthopedic Association scoring system (17-point scale). Signal intensity change in the cord was qualitatively assessed on both T1- and T2-weighted images. The transverse area of the CSC on MRIs and glucose metabolic rate (standardized uptake value [SUV]) from 18FDG-PET were measured digitally.

Neurologic improvement correlated with the preoperative CSC transverse area at maximal compression (P < 0.01) and at follow-up (P < 0.001) and with mean SUV before surgery (P < 0.01) and at follow-up (P < 0.05). Preoperative signal intensity change on MRIs (low intramedullary signal intensity abnormality).

### Cervical spinal cord compression attributable to a calcified intervertebral disc in a patient with X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets: case report and review of the literature [^115rL1Js]. Neurosurgery (2002). Low credibility.

X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets is a common inherited phosphate-wasting disorder, but it is a rare cause of spinal cord compression. We present the first reported case of a calcified intervertebral disc causing spinal canal stenosis in X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets.

- **Clinical presentation**: A 44-year-old woman presented with paresthesia of her left arm and a loss of grip in both hands. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a calcified intervertebral disc, as well as a posterior osteophytic bar causing marked cervical cord compression at C6/C7.

- **Intervention**: An anterior cervical discectomy at C6/C7 and fusion with autologous bone graft were performed. The patient then exhibited significant improvement.

- **Conclusion**: A review of the 16 published cases demonstrates that thickening of the vertebral laminae, facet joint hypertrophy, and ossification of the intervertebral discs, posterior longitudinal ligament, and/or ligamentum flavum contribute to spinal canal stenosis in X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets. Those changes are caused by the disease itself and are unlikely to be related to long-term vitamin D treatment. Eleven of 16 patients were reported to have experienced favorable outcomes after surgery.

### Laminectomy and posterior cervical plating for multilevel cervical spondylotic myelopathy and ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament: effects on cervical alignment, spinal cord compression, and neurological outcome [^117KLxFv]. Neurosurgery (2003). Low credibility.

Multilevel anterior decompressive procedures for cervical spondylotic myelopathy or ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament may be associated with a high incidence of neurological morbidity, construct failure, and pseudoarthrosis. We theorized that laminectomy and stabilization of the cervical spine with lateral mass plates would obviate the disadvantages of anterior decompression, prevent the development of kyphotic deformity frequently seen after uninstrumented laminectomy, decompress the spinal cord, and produce neurological results equal or superior to those achieved by multilevel anterior procedures.

- **Methods**: We retrospectively reviewed the records of 38 patients who underwent laminectomy and lateral mass plating for cervical spondylotic myelopathy or ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament between January 1994 and November 2001. Seventy-six percent of patients had spondylosis, 18% had ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament, and 5% had both. Clinical presentation included upper extremity sensory complaints (89%), gait difficulty (70%), and hand use deterioration (67%). Spasticity was present in 83%, and weakness of one or more muscle groups was seen in 79%. Spinal cord signal abnormality on sagittal T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was seen in 68%. Neurological evaluation was performed using a modification of the Japanese Orthopedic Association Scale for functional assessment of myelopathy, the Cooper Scale for separate evaluation of upper and lower extremity motor function, and a five-point scale for evaluation.

### Automated signal intensity analysis of the spinal cord for detection of degenerative cervical myelopathy - a matched-pair MRI study [^115rFHkF]. Neuroradiology (2023). High credibility.

This fully automated T2 signal quantification of the spinal cord was able to reveal a significantly different variability of the T2-SI in patients with DCM and present T2 hyperintensities compared to healthy volunteers. Whilst the absolute T2-SI values are not applicable due to known individual imaging conditions, we introduced the new, inter-individually comparable T2 myelopathy index (T2-MI), showing corresponding significances to the extent of signal variability represented by the standard deviation and range of T2-SI at every cervical level.

This automated, innovative procedure has the potential for diagnosing radiological DCM more objectively and standardized, thus optimizing the recommendation for treatment. The determination of more detailed cut-off values associated with the different stages of DCM and its diagnostic accuracy is under further investigation.

### Predicting the risk of adjacent segment pathology in the cervical spine: A systematic review [^116f2fvi]. Spine (2012). Low credibility.

The study design is a systematic review. The objective was to perform a systematic review to determine the risk and define potential identifiable risk factors for developing adjacent segment pathology (ASP) after cervical fusion surgery.

During the past several decades, the indications for spinal arthrodesis have expanded, with a dramatic increase in the rate of cervical spine fusion in the United States. However, as more of these procedures are performed, concerns have arisen regarding the potential for patients to develop changes at levels adjacent to the index procedure. Questions remain about whether the development of clinical ASP (CASP) is iatrogenic in nature or part of its natural history.

A systematic review of the literature was undertaken for articles published in English between 1990 and March 15, 2012. Electronic databases and reference lists of key articles were searched to identify articles reporting risk factors for CASP after cervical fusion. Two independent reviewers assessed the level of evidence and the overall quality of the literature using the Grades of Recommendation Assessment, Development, and Evaluation criteria. Disagreements were resolved by consensus.

In the results, five studies (four retrospective cohorts, one database study) met the inclusion criteria from a total of 176 possible studies for review. The prevalence of CASP ranged from 11% to 12% at 5 years, 16% to 38% at 10 years, and 33% at 17 years. Factors that may contribute to the development of CASP are not fully detailed in this text.

### Postoperative resolution of magnetic resonance imaging signal intensity changes and the associated impact on outcomes in degenerative cervical myelopathy: Analysis of a global cohort of patients [^112vJ8Qn]. Spine (2018). Low credibility.

Subanalysis of the prospective AOSpine CSM North America and international studies describes the postoperative changes in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) spinal cord signal intensity in degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) patients. It also investigates the impact of postoperative resolution on clinical outcomes. When examining the spinal cord, hyperintensity found in MRI T2-weighted images and hypointensity in T1-weighted images are known to correlate with preoperative severity of DCM and to predict postoperative neurological recovery. However, the clinical importance of these signal intensity changes in postoperative images has not been established.

Among 757 surgical DCM patients enrolled in two prospective multicenter studies, postoperative MRI images obtained between 6 and 24 months after the operation were examined with a focus on T2 hyperintensity and T1 hypointensity in the spinal cord. The 2-year postoperative Nurick grade, modified Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) score, and modified JOA recovery rate (RR) were analyzed between patients with or without resolution of signal intensity changes.

A total of 167 patients with preoperative T2 hyperintensity were included with complete postoperative MRI images. Of these patients, 11% showed resolution of signal intensity changes, 70% retained T2 hyperintensity only, and 19% showed both T2 hyper- and T1 hypointensity postoperatively. There was a stepwise trend toward worse postoperative outcomes with the persistence of signal intensity changes.

### The role of neuronal plasticity in cervical spondylotic myelopathy surgery: Functional assessment and prognostic implication [^1166pzfZ]. Neurosurgical Review (2023). High credibility.

The dorsal column of the spinal cord is composed of sensory afferent fibers. Due to an injury, a section of this pathway in the cervical spinal cord can deactivate much of the primary somatosensory cortex and other areas. Following this injury, these affected areas can reorganize to ensure functional recovery by creating new neuronal circuitry. Over the years, several studies have focused on the concept of neural plasticity following cervical injury, the imaging techniques to evaluate it, and the relation between preoperative and postoperative imaging findings and the functional recovery of patients after surgery.

For instance, it is possible to employ functional MRI (fMRI) to evaluate neural plasticity. The differentiation due to acute spinal cord injury causes an immediate change in wide cortical networks that can be noticed on fMRI, which shows the expansion of M1 representation and the increased activation of supplementary motor areas as a result of cerebral reorganization.

Duggal et al. compared preoperative and postoperative brain fMRI to characterize the changes occurring in cortical activation after surgical decompression. In preoperative patients, the volume of activation (VOA) was greater compared to controls within the precentral gyrus while VOA was greater after surgical decompression — a characteristic that may represent increased recruitment within the primary motor cortex in patients with cervical myelopathy. However, within the postcentral gyrus, VOA was greater.

### State of the art in degenerative cervical myelopathy: An update on current clinical evidence [^116xa8nx]. Neurosurgery (2017). Low credibility.

Degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) is a common cause of spinal cord dysfunction that confronts clinicians daily. Research over the past few decades has provided improved insight into the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of this disorder. We aim to provide clinicians with an update regarding the state of the art in DCM, focusing on more recent research pertaining to pathophysiology, natural history, treatment, consideration of the minimally symptomatic patient, surgical outcome prediction, and outcome measurement.

- **Pathophysiology**: Concepts focus on the combination of static and dynamic elements leading to breakdown of the blood-spinal cord barrier at the site of compression, resulting in local inflammation, cellular dysfunction, and apoptosis.

- **Treatment**: Although there is a dearth of high-quality studies comparing surgical to nonoperative treatment, several large prospective studies have recently associated surgical management with clinically and statistically significant improvement in functional, disability, and quality of life outcomes at long-term follow-up.

- **Surgical intervention**: When selecting the specific surgical intervention for a patient with DCM, anterior (discectomy, corpectomy, hybrid discectomy/corpectomy), posterior (laminectomy and fusion, laminoplasty), and combined approaches may be considered as options depending on the specifics of the patient in question. Evidence supporting each of these approaches is reviewed in detail.

Recently developed clinical prediction models allow for accurate forecasting of postoperative outcomes.

### Diagnostic role of flexion-extension central motor conduction time in cervical spondylotic myelopathy [^1148XUKi]. Spine (2021). Low credibility.

Cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM) is a disease resulting from progressive compression of the spinal canal and the cervical cord due to degenerative changes of the cervical vertebrae and is usually concomitant with aging. Representative degenerative conditions of cervical stenosis are intervertebral disc protrusion, spondylolisthesis, and ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL). They provoke symptoms ranging from mild neck pain and radiating pain to spinal cord syndromes such as paresthesia, weakness, clumsy hand, and gait disturbance.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is widely utilized as a diagnostic tool for confirming cord compression. Many patients with CSM show not only static cord compression in the neutral neck position but also dynamic cord compression during neck flexion and extension. Numerous studies describe the diagnosis of compressive cervical myelopathy using dynamic MRI as well as static MRI to identify impingement of the cervical cord.

Electrophysiological studies have also been conducted to evaluate not only spinal cord compression but combined neurologic conditions such as cervical radiculopathy and peripheral neuropathies. Among these electrophysiological evaluations, motor evoked potential (MEP) recorded by transcranial magnetic stimulation is a key variable to ascertain whether there is a disturbance of central motor conduction along the corticospinal tract. It has been widely reported that central motor conduction time (CMCT) derived from MEP and motor conduction studies are objective and sensitive values to assess central motor pathology.

### Posterior cervical decompression and instrumented fusion for cervical spondylotic myelopathy: 2-dimensional operative video [^111jJime]. Operative Neurosurgery (2019). High credibility.

Cervical spondylotic myelopathy is a common cause of progressive quadriparesis in adults. It is characterized by compression of the cervical spinal cord due to degenerative changes, including intervertebral disc protrusion, ligamentum flavum hypertrophy, and osteophyte formation. Clinically, patients can present with declining motor control in the extremities, gait imbalance, spasticity, hyperreflexia, or possibly frank weakness.

Surgical treatment options include ventral and dorsal approaches, with indications varying depending on spinal alignment, number of levels requiring decompression, the dorsal/ventral/circumferential location of compression, and patient-specific anatomic constraints. Posterior cervical decompression and instrumented fusion is a mainstay of treatment for cervical spondylotic myelopathy when a dorsal approach is indicated.

In this video, we present a case of a 60-year-old female who presented with signs and symptoms of cervical myelopathy, with MRI findings of C3 on C4 anterolisthesis and circumferential central stenosis worst at C4–5 and C5–6. We demonstrate the operative steps to complete a C3 to C6 decompression and instrumented fusion with lateral mass screws. Appropriate patient consent was obtained.

### A diagnostic biomarker for cervical myelopathy based on dynamic magnetic resonance imaging [^111E9EDb]. Spine (2023). High credibility.

The study is a multicenter prospective observational study. Diffusion tensor imaging in flexion-extension improves the diagnosis of degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM). The aim was to provide an imaging biomarker for the detection of DCM. DCM is the most common form of spinal cord dysfunction in adults; however, imaging surveillance for myelopathy remains poorly characterized.

Symptomatic DCM patients were examined in maximum neck flexion-extension and neutral positions in a 3T-magnetic resonance imaging scanner and allocated to two groups: (1) patients with visible intramedullary hyperintensity (IHIS) on T2-weighted imaging (IHIS+, n = 10); and (2) patients without IHIS (IHIS-, n = 11). Range of motion, space available for the spinal cord, apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), axial diffusivity (AD), radial diffusivity, and fractional anisotropy were measured and compared between the neck positions, between the groups, and between control (C2/3) and pathologic segments.

Significant differences between the control level (C2/3) and pathologic segments were observed for the IHIS+ group at a neutral neck position in AD; at flexion in ADC and AD; and at neck extension in ADC, AD, and fractional anisotropy values. For the IHIS- group, significant differences between the control level (C2/3) and pathologic segments were found only for ADC values in neck extension. When comparing diffusion parameters between groups, radial diffusivity was significantly different in all three neck positions.

### Diagnosis, heritability, and outcome assessment in cervical myelopathy: a consensus statement [^111d5q3G]. Spine (2013). Low credibility.

This section of the cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM) Spine focus issue collates evidence related to diagnosis, outcome assessment, and genetics. Given that a variety of different disease states can present similarly, a guide for diagnosing and differentiating CSM from other neurological conditions is initially presented. Although the value of magnetic resonance imaging in diagnosing CSM is cemented, its value as a tool to predict future outcomes is less well established.

The existing evidence suggests that while increased T2 cord signal has limited value, the pairing of high T2 signal with low T1 signal, or a high T2 to T1 signal ratio, is associated with a reduced potential for neurological recovery at follow-up. Outcome assessment in CSM is of paramount importance when monitoring patients' clinical course or measuring the efficacy of therapeutic interventions. The main outcome measures that have been used to assess patients with CSM are reviewed. At present, we recommend that clinicians acquire the modified Japanese Orthopaedic Association scale score and the Neck Disability Index on all patients with CSM at presentation and follow-up.

In regard to genetics, the existing evidence seems to support the principle of an inherited predisposition to both CSM and ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament. Although several genetic polymorphisms have been consistently associated with ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament, no specific polymorphisms were consistently associated with CSM.

### Clinical evidence for cervical myelopathy due to Chiari malformation and spinal stenosis in a non-randomized group of patients with the diagnosis of fibromyalgia [^115zR94b]. European Spine Journal (2004). Low credibility.

While patients with fibromyalgia report symptoms consistent with cervical myelopathy, a detailed neurological evaluation is not routine. We sought to determine if patients with fibromyalgia manifest objective neurological signs of cervical myelopathy.

Two hundred and seventy patients, 18 years and older, who carried the diagnosis of fibromyalgia but had no previously recognized neurological disease, underwent detailed clinical neurological and neuroradiological evaluation for the prevalence of objective evidence of cervical myelopathy and radiological evidence of cerebellar tonsillar herniation (Chiari 1 malformation) or cervical spinal canal stenosis.

Patients were primarily women (87%), of mean age 44 years, who had been symptomatic for 8 years (standard deviation, 6.3 years). The predominant complaints were neck/back pain (95%), fatigue (95%), exertional fatigue (96%), cognitive impairment (92%), instability of gait (85%), grip weakness (83%), paresthesiae (80%), dizziness (71%), and numbness (69%). Eighty-eight percent of patients reported worsening symptoms with neck extension.

The neurological examination was consistent with cervical myelopathy: upper thoracic spinothalamic sensory level (83%), hyperreflexia (64%), inversion of the radial periosteal reflex (57%), positive Romberg sign (28%), ankle clonus (25%), positive Hoffman sign (26%), impaired tandem walk (23%), dysmetria (15%), and dysdiadochokinesia (13%). MRI and contrast-enhanced CT imaging of the cervical spine revealed stenosis.

### Comparison of two anterior reconstructive techniques in the treatment of 3-level and 4 level cervical spondylotic myelopathy: A meta-analysis of last decade [^1171G12W]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2022). Low credibility.

Cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM) is a common cervical disease, affecting 10% to 15% of cervical spondylosis. CSM, especially multilevel CSM, is the major cause of spinal cord injury and neurological dysfunction, posing a great social and economic burden on individuals due to lifelong disability. Regarding patients with worsening clinical symptoms and indicators, surgical therapy is preferable to conservative treatment. Anterior surgical interventions such as anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) and anterior cervical corpectomy and fusion (ACCF) have been routinely used in patients with 3-level and 4-level CSM. ACDF can decompress the anterior spinal cord and maintain spinal column stability, yet it may increase the significant risk of inadequate decompression, restricted visual exposure, or cord damage. ACCF may provide more widespread decompression, but it is more difficult to implement and has a higher risk of complications.

Which anterior surgery, ACDF or ACCF, is the better option for 3-level and 4-level CSM remains controversial. Shamji performed a meta-analysis and demonstrated that ACDF was the better option for multilevel CSM. Wang found that both were good plans for clinical outcomes, but ACDF was better than ACCF in radiographic outcomes and the number of total complications. However, two other authors concluded that ACDF and ACCF had similar outcomes in the treatment of multilevel CSM. To our knowledge, previous meta-analyses had some limitations, such as small samples, mainly studying 2-level or 3-level cases.

### Efficacy and safety of surgery for mild degenerative cervical myelopathy: Results of the AOSPINE North America and international prospective multicenter studies [^114mGYrE]. Neurosurgery (2019). Low credibility.

Degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) is a progressive degenerative spinal condition and the leading cause of spinal cord dysfunction among adults worldwide. This clinicopathological entity encompasses osteoarthritic degeneration, such as cervical spondylosis, and ligamentous aberrations, e.g. ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) and hypertrophy of the ligamentum flavum (HLF). Over 70% of individuals aged 60 to 65 and older demonstrate pathological or radiological evidence of cervical degeneration, and approximately one-quarter of these individuals become clinically symptomatic due to mechanical neural compression. The proportion of the United States population aged 65 or older is expected to nearly double from 13% in 2010 to 22% in 2050, making optimal diagnosis and treatment of DCM a key public health priority.

Controversy in the treatment of DCM has stemmed largely from mixed reports regarding the natural history of this condition. Although there is some variability, a significant number of patients, ranging from 20% to 60%, will deteriorate neurologically over time when treated non-operatively. Traditionally, surgical decompression for DCM was performed to halt the progression of neurological dysfunction and prevent further disability. However, more recent evidence indicates that surgical intervention for DCM is actually associated with improved function and quality of life. As a result, surgery is now becoming the standard of care for patients with clearly symptomatic DCM. Nonetheless, controversy persists regarding the optimal management of patients with only mild symptoms.

### Proposing a framework to understand the role of imaging in degenerative cervical myelopathy: Enhancement of MRI protocols needed for accurate diagnosis and evaluation [^112Dxn95]. Spine (2022). Low credibility.

While these new modalities remain in development, there are many simpler gains. Discussions within the RECODE DCM working group revealed that the imaging framework would support educational initiatives. For example, those living with DCM referenced the common "lay" misconception that a diagnostic test provides certainty. This framework could help raise awareness among non-expert professionals to identify individuals with mild stenosis and symptoms, allowing for timely management while avoiding surgery in patients with asymptomatic stenosis.

Future directions in the neuroimaging evaluation of DCM require a standardized definition of spinal canal narrowing, spinal cord compression, and intrinsic cord signal changes. Systematic literature reviews with consensus-based evidence synthesis could lay the groundwork for developing an objective imaging diagnostic framework for DCM. Creating a simple framework for diagnosis in DCM has the potential to dramatically change care and outcomes. Novel methods for determining spinal cord distress are currently under examination and may reshape our view on DCM, but they remain a work in progress. We look forward to feedback and perspectives from the community and hope more will work with us on this endeavor.

### Intraoperative neuromonitoring loss in abnormal magnetic resonance imaging signal intensity from patients with cervical compressive myelopathy [^114f6oS9]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2017). Low credibility.

Our objective in this study was to evaluate whether cervical compressive myelopathy (CCM) patients with preoperative abnormal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are more likely to experience intraoperative neuromonitoring (IONM) loss.

A consecutive series of 152 CCM patients who underwent cervical cord decompression were enrolled in this study between December 2013 and February 2017. All patients with abnormal MRI signal intensity were divided into two groups: Group 1 included patients with T2-WIs hyperintensity, and group 2 included patients with both T2-WIs hyperintensity and T1-WIs hypointensity. Relevant IONM changes were identified as significant transcranial motor evoked potentials (MEP) loss associated with surgical decompression of the cervical cord.

There were 121 patients in group 1, of whom 6 cases showed IONM degeneration; 31 patients in group 2, with 13 cases showing IONM degeneration (6/121 versus 13/31, p = 0.000). Moreover, one case in group 1 presented with transient new spinal deficits after surgery, with no permanent spinal deficits. In group 2, 5 cases presented transient new spinal deficits, and 2 cases showed permanent spinal deficits. Additionally, in group 2, the MEP amplitude before and after decompression showed a significant difference (134 μV ± 30.2 versus 65 μV ± 26.2, ✱ p < 0.05).

Our results suggest that IONM degeneration or postoperative spinal deficits are more likely in patients with abnormal T2-WIs and T1-WIs. Appropriate and timely interventions may be useful for IONM recovery.

### Advances in MR imaging for cervical spondylotic myelopathy [^117AcMTy]. European Spine Journal (2015). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study is to outline the pathogenesis of cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM), the correlative abnormalities observed on standard magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the biological implications, and the status of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and MR spectroscopy (MRS) as clinical tools. It also explores future directions of MR technology in the management of CSM patients.

- **Methods**: A systematic review of the pathogenesis and state-of-the-art MR imaging technology for CSM was performed.

- **Results**: CSM is caused by progressive, degenerative vertebral column abnormalities that result in spinal cord damage related to both primary mechanical and secondary biological injuries. The T2 signal change on conventional MRI is most commonly associated with neurological deficits but tends not to be a sensitive predictor of recovery of function. DTI and MRS show altered microstructure and biochemistry that reflect patient-specific pathogenesis.

- **Conclusion**: Advanced imaging techniques, including DTI and MRS, show higher sensitivity to microstructural and biochemical changes within the cord and may aid in the management of CSM patients.

### Magnetic resonance imaging of acute intramedullary myelopathy: Radiological differential diagnosis for the on-call radiologist [^115mRaQR]. Clinical Radiology (2009). Low credibility.

Spinal cord disease is often viewed as having a poor outcome. Although this is true in certain conditions, non-traumatic myelopathy encompasses a vast array of diseases, some of which are exquisitely responsive to treatment. Accurate diagnosis becomes important as damage is often progressive, and long-term disability and morbidity are related to the degree of neurological impairment when the diagnosis is reached. Out-of-hours magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is generally requested and performed to ascertain whether there is spinal cord compression; however, there are other causes of a cord syndrome that are more subtle. This review aims to provide a summary of the imaging features of non-traumatic intramedullary spinal cord emergencies, many of which may appear radiologically similar.

### The role of neuronal plasticity in cervical spondylotic myelopathy surgery: functional assessment and prognostic implication [^115pNVzX]. Neurosurgical Review (2023). Low credibility.

- **Figure description**: A–B illustrations demonstrate anterior and posterior surgical corridors for cervical myelopathy.

Finally, it is possible to perform a combined approach, particularly indicated for patients with severe kyphotic angulation necessitating decompression of three or more levels. At the time of writing, decompressive surgery remains the most effective long-term treatment for this pathology, although the decision on which type of approach to use and when to perform such a procedure remains challenging.

- **Prognostic factors**: Several factors could affect the outcome after surgical management. The most important prognostic factors are the duration of symptoms, preoperative neurological status, the effective diameter of the canal, number of compression levels, intrinsic cord alterations (assessed from pre-operative MRI study), and other clinic-radiological features. In recent years, novel techniques have been applied to investigate central nervous system (CNS) pathology.

### Magnetic resonance imaging assessment of degenerative cervical myelopathy: A review of structural changes and measurement techniques [^112GhXG5]. Neurosurgical Focus (2016). Low credibility.

Degenerative cervical myelopathy encompasses a spectrum of age-related structural changes of the cervical spine that result in static and dynamic injury to the spinal cord and collectively represent the most common cause of myelopathy in adults. Although cervical myelopathy is determined clinically, the diagnosis requires confirmation via imaging, and MRI is the preferred modality.

Because of the heterogeneity of the condition and evolution of MRI technology, multiple techniques have been developed over the years in an attempt to quantify the degree of baseline severity and potential for neurological recovery. In this review, these techniques are categorized anatomically into those that focus on bone, ligaments, discs, and the spinal cord. In addition, measurements for the cervical spine canal size and sagittal alignment are also described briefly. These tools have resulted collectively in the identification of numerous useful parameters.

However, the development of multiple techniques for assessing the same feature, such as cord compression, has also resulted in a number of challenges, including introducing ambiguity in terms of which methods to use and hindering effective comparisons of analyses in the literature. In addition, newer techniques that use advanced MRI are emerging and providing exciting new tools for assessing the spinal cord in patients with degenerative cervical myelopathy.

### Predictors of surgical outcome in cervical spondylotic myelopathy: Focusing on the quantitative signal intensity [^11773oRw]. European Spine Journal (2015). Low credibility.

The association between intramedullary increased signal intensity (ISI) on T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging and surgical outcome in cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM) remains controversial. The purpose of this study is to assess the impact of the quantitative signal change ratio (SCR) on the surgical outcome for CSM.

- **Methods**: The prospective study included 108 consecutive patients who underwent surgical treatment for CSM. The Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) score and recovery rate were used to evaluate clinical outcomes. A JOA recovery rate of less than 50% was defined as a poor clinical result. The SCR was defined as the signal intensity at the level of ISI or severely compressed cord (in cases with no ISI) divided by the signal intensity at the C7-T1 disc level. Factors such as age, sex, body mass index, duration of symptoms, surgical technique, preoperative JOA score, levels of compression, preoperative SCR, preoperative C2–7 angle, and preoperative C2–7 range of motion were assessed.

- **Results**: Forty patients (37.0%) had a recovery rate of less than 50%. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that a higher preoperative SCR and a longer duration of symptoms were significant risk factors for a poor clinical outcome. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis showed that the optimal preoperative SCR cutoff value as a predictor of poor clinical result was 1.46. The area under the ROC curve of preoperative SCR for predicting a poor surgical outcome was 0.844.

- **Conclusions**: Preoperative SCR significantly reflected the surgical outcome in patients with CSM.

### Quantifying neurodegeneration of the cervical cord and brain in degenerative cervical myelopathy: A multicentre study using quantitative magnetic resonance imaging [^113Cuewd]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Low credibility.

Degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) is the most common form of nontraumatic spinal cord injury in adults, with a rising incidence among the global aging population. DCM-induced disability can manifest differently in individuals, spanning a spectrum from mild pain and minor hand numbness to severe cases of incomplete tetraplegia. These severe cases can result in long-lasting impairments of upper extremity function, gait difficulties, and bladder dysfunction. DCM is characterized by chronic spinal cord compression, leading to neural tissue destruction at the site of compression. It can also cause remote changes in the spinal cord and even affect the brain. The standard of care for moderate to severe DCM is surgical decompression. However, for mildly affected DCM patients, the ideal timing for surgical intervention remains uncertain. It is worth noting that even after anatomically successful surgery, some DCM patients may still experience progressive disability.

Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (qMRI) techniques have the potential to offer biomarkers sensitive to pathophysiological changes with clinical significance. Consequently, these techniques hold promise for enhancing the prediction of recovery in patients with DCM and assisting in clinical decision-making. The robustness and reproducibility of qMRI methods across multiple clinical sites are crucial prerequisites for the development of such biomarkers. Furthermore, there is a growing need to enhance statistical power to improve the efficiency of clinical studies.

### Automated signal intensity analysis of the spinal cord for detection of degenerative cervical myelopathy - a matched-pair MRI study [^115ki6zy]. Neuroradiology (2023). High credibility.

Figure 5 depicts two exemplary segments at level C5/6 with a typical T2-SI curve for a patient showing a high signal variability (red curve) and a healthy volunteer with a nearly linear curve (blue). The extent of the variability might reflect the dimension of intramedullary alterations and is expected to be associated with the severity of myelopathy symptoms and anticipated outcome after treatment.

All three parameters reflecting the T2-SI variability have the advantage of grading alterations within the spinal cord in a more dedicated, metric setting, rather than dealing with binary or ordinal subjective scales. Therefore, a better correlation to the clinical affection and different stages of degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) is expected. A limitation of this data is that it shows isolated radiological parameters without linking them to clinical affection. We expect that, associated with previously mentioned evaluations, the extent of the signal variability correlates with clinical impairment, which is already subject to further clinically-centered investigations.

Independently of the clinical correlation, this evaluation procedure operates fully automated without dealing with rater-dependency and is applicable for every high-resolution T2-weighted sequence in advance, which marks a new step in the radiological assessment of DCM.

### The relationship between MRI signal intensity changes, clinical presentation, and surgical outcome in degenerative cervical myelopathy: Analysis of a global cohort [^112zAvmu]. Spine (2017). Low credibility.

This study is a retrospective analysis of prospective data aiming to assess the relationship between MRI signal intensity changes, clinical presentation, and surgical outcome in degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM).

Several studies have sought to assess the extent of spinal cord dysfunction and the potential for postoperative neurological recovery through the evaluation of spinal cord signal change on T2-weighted (T2WI) and T1-weighted images (T1WI). Ambiguity remains regarding whether T2WI and T1WI signal changes (1) relate to baseline severity and (2) predict neurological recovery after surgical treatment.

Four hundred nineteen MRIs from two prospective multicenter studies were examined. Images were assessed for the presence, levels, and location of spinal cord signal intensity changes and compared with clinical data. Signal changes were also evaluated for the prediction of 2-year postoperative outcome using mJOA parameters.

MRIs were categorized by T1WI and T2WI signal change: no signal change (28.9%), T2WI hyperintensity-only (T2WI-only, 51.8%), and T2WI-hyperintensity and T1WI-hypointensity (T1WI+T2WI, 19.3%). T2WI-hyperintensity was present at multiple levels in 27% of patients overall. Baseline severity increased from no signal change to T2WI-only to T2WI+T1WI (P < 0.0001), and there was an incremental increase in the frequency of signs/symptoms. There were no differences in outcomes between no signal change and T2WI-only groups. The presence of T1WI-hypointensity correlated with reduced recovery ratio (P = 0.03).
