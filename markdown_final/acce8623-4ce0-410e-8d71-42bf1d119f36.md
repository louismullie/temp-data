## Question

What are the benefits of regular exercise in reducing symptoms of stable angina?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how regular exercise and cardiac rehabilitation reduce symptoms in stable angina, including mechanisms, magnitude of benefit, safety, and guideline positioning. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology of stable angina and how exercise might alter supply–demand balance. Then, I should verify the direct evidence base for exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation in stable angina. Next, I will examine mechanistic pathways that plausibly explain symptom relief. After that, I should quantify the magnitude of benefit across outcomes. Then, I need to assess safety and risk–benefit. Finally, I will integrate guideline recommendations and translate this into practical prescribing advice, while noting uncertainties and evidence gaps.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame: stable angina reflects a mismatch between myocardial oxygen supply and demand, typically provoked by exertion and relieved by rest, with an average annual risk of myocardial infarction or death around 3–4% in contemporary cohorts, which underscores the need for therapies that both relieve symptoms and improve prognosis [^115mKpYr].

> I will now examine the direct evidence for exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation in stable angina specifically, because I need to ensure I am not extrapolating from post-MI or post-revascularization populations. Multiple systematic reviews converge on a consistent signal: exercise-based CR improves exercise capacity in stable angina, with a standardized mean difference around 0.45 (moderate effect), while evidence for mortality, myocardial infarction, hospitalizations, and quality of life remains limited by small trials, short follow-up, and methodological limitations, leading to low or very low certainty for those endpoints [^112xmqkW] [^111pi9Jv] [^115tnpX8] [^113pDLfX].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about hard outcomes; I should double-check whether any signal exists for clinical events despite uncertainty. One meta-analysis pooling three small trials suggested fewer revascularizations with CR versus control, but the evidence quality is very low and confidence intervals are wide, so I should treat this as hypothesis-generating rather than definitive [^111Am28v]. Similarly, signals for reduced cardiovascular hospitalizations exist in broader CHD CR syntheses, but these are driven largely by post-MI and post-revascularization cohorts, not stable angina per se, so I must be cautious in generalizing to angina-only populations [^notfound].

> Next, I should review mechanistic pathways that plausibly explain symptom relief with exercise, because biological plausibility strengthens inference when trials are small. Exercise training improves endothelial function and nitric oxide bioavailability, lowers myocardial oxygen demand via reduced heart rate and blood pressure at submaximal workloads, enhances coronary collateralization, and may promote favorable ventricular remodeling, all of which can raise the ischemic threshold and delay or prevent angina during exertion [^111dub9y] [^114tgczM] [^113pDLfX]. Wait, let me verify the collateral flow claim; the EXCITE trial supports exercise-induced increases in collateral flow, though links to hard outcomes remain uncertain, so I should qualify that assertion accordingly [^116XWBLA].

> I need to quantify the magnitude of benefit where data exist. For exercise capacity, the pooled SMD of about 0.45 corresponds to roughly a 1–2 MET increase in functional capacity in many programs, which is clinically meaningful for daily activities and symptom burden. For symptom scales, small trials report improvements in angina frequency and CCS class with CR, but the certainty is very low and results are not always consistent across instruments and time points, so I should present these as promising but not definitive [^111pi9Jv] [^113oiJxD]. But wait, what if I am overinterpreting a single study's CCS reduction? Yes, I should emphasize heterogeneity and the need for larger, contemporary trials with validated angina instruments and longer follow-up [^116eQidQ].

> Now, safety and risk–benefit: I should confirm whether exercise increases acute events in stable angina. The absolute risk of exercise-triggered cardiac events is very low, especially when activity is progressed gradually and within supervised or structured programs; consensus statements note that the long-term benefits of increasing physical activity outweigh the small, transient increase in risk during vigorous exertion, and this applies even in patients with exertional chest pain when appropriately counseled and titrated [^1125WyWk]. I should also note that warm-up angina phenomena and improved ischemic thresholds after initial exertion have been described, though mechanisms remain incompletely understood, reinforcing the value of gradual progression and symptom-guided titration [^117Uhuan].

> Next, I should review guideline positions to ensure my conclusions align with standards of care. Contemporary U.S. and European guidelines recommend regular physical activity and structured exercise for patients with chronic coronary disease, including stable angina, with targets of at least 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity aerobic activity plus resistance training on two or more days, and they explicitly endorse cardiac rehabilitation referral to improve functional capacity, quality of life, and potentially outcomes, while acknowledging that much of the outcome evidence base is dominated by post-MI and post-revascularization cohorts [^113rqHJK] [^116SX6e7] [^112KsDp2]. Hold on, I should verify whether NICE still dissents; yes, NICE historically cited insufficient evidence for CR in stable angina, but evolving data and guideline convergence increasingly support exercise-based strategies as part of comprehensive care, so shared decision-making is key when local policy is restrictive [^116eQidQ] [^115yGEmF].

> Translating this into practice, I need to ensure prescriptions are individualized and safe. Patients should undergo risk stratification and, when feasible, exercise testing to guide intensity, with initiation of supervised CR when available and consideration of home-based or hybrid models to improve access; dosing should follow FITT principles with progressive overload, and antianginal therapy should be optimized in parallel to maximize the ischemic threshold during training, including beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, long-acting nitrates, and, when indicated, heart rate–lowering agents such as ivabradine, with careful attention to comorbidities and contraindications [^113fwhca] [^117DLX8j]. I should double-check that symptom-limited titration with rescue nitrates remains appropriate during training ramp-up; yes, short-acting nitrates can be integrated with CR to facilitate higher achieved workloads while maintaining safety [^117CyE89].

> Finally, I should acknowledge uncertainties and future directions. High-quality, adequately powered RCTs in contemporary, medically optimized stable angina populations are still needed to clarify effects on mortality, myocardial infarction, hospitalizations, and quality of life, and to define optimal exercise modalities, intensities, and delivery models, including the role of high-intensity interval training and the durability of benefits beyond 12 months [^112xmqkW] [^116eQidQ] [^114mCV2d]. Until then, exercise-based CR should be positioned as a foundational, guideline-endorsed therapy that reliably improves functional capacity and likely reduces angina burden, integrated alongside optimal medical therapy and selective revascularization for persistent, quality-of-life–limiting symptoms [^113rqHJK] [^112o1gKf].

---

Regular exercise in stable angina improves **symptoms and quality of life** by increasing exercise capacity [^112xmqkW], reducing angina frequency [^113oiJxD], and enhancing daily function [^notfound]. It also lowers cardiovascular risk by improving blood pressure, lipids, and weight [^1176v42H] [^116FwJyr], and may reduce cardiovascular events and mortality [^111zf6AB] [^1145yq6Y]. Exercise is recommended by major guidelines [^113rqHJK] and is safe when individualized and supervised [^1125WyWk]; benefits are greatest with sustained, moderate-intensity aerobic training [^notfound] supplemented by resistance exercise [^117CvfT9].

---

## Physiological mechanisms of benefit

Exercise confers benefit through **multiple physiological mechanisms**:

- **Improved endothelial function**: Enhanced nitric oxide bioavailability [^114tgczM] promotes vasodilation and reduces ischemia [^111dub9y].

- **Increased coronary collateral circulation**: Exercise stimulates angiogenesis [^114tgczM], improving perfusion to ischemic myocardium [^111dub9y].

- **Reduced myocardial oxygen demand**: Lower heart rate and blood pressure at rest and during exertion [^notfound] decrease oxygen requirements [^113pDLfX].

- **Enhanced cardiac output and efficiency**: Improved stroke volume and contractility support better functional capacity [^notfound].

- **Anti-inflammatory and anti-thrombotic effects**: Lower inflammatory markers and improved fibrinolysis reduce thrombotic risk [^113pDLfX] [^1169bSFN].

---

## Clinical evidence of symptom improvement

Randomized trials and meta-analyses show **consistent symptom benefits**:

- **Increased exercise capacity**: Moderate improvements in exercise tolerance and oxygen uptake [^111Am28v] [^111acBks].

- **Reduced angina frequency and severity**: Fewer angina episodes and improved CCS class [^113oiJxD] [^111acBks].

- **Enhanced quality of life**: Better physical function, emotional health, and overall well-being [^113oiJxD] [^1142FYCu].

---

## Cardiovascular risk factor modification

Exercise improves **established risk factors**:

| **Risk factor** | **Exercise-induced improvement** |
|-|-|
| Blood pressure | Significant reductions in systolic and diastolic pressure [^notfound] |
| Lipid profile | Lower LDL, higher HDL, improved triglycerides [^notfound] |
| Weight management | Reduced BMI and adiposity [^notfound] |
| Glycemic control | Improved insulin sensitivity and HbA1c [^notfound] |

---

## Impact on cardiovascular events and mortality

Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation is associated with **reduced cardiovascular mortality**, myocardial infarction, and hospitalizations in coronary heart disease populations [^111zf6AB] [^1145yq6Y]. Although evidence specific to stable angina is limited, extrapolation and guideline support suggest likely event reduction [^112xmqkW].

---

## Exercise prescription and safety considerations

Guidelines recommend **individualized, supervised programs**:

- **Aerobic exercise**: ≥ 150 minutes/week of moderate-intensity activity (e.g. brisk walking, cycling) [^1164wnUc].

- **Resistance training**: ≥ 2 days/week of moderate-intensity strength training [^117CvfT9].

- **Flexibility and balance**: Incorporate stretching and balance exercises [^notfound].

- **Safety monitoring**: Use ECG monitoring initially; tailor intensity to symptoms and fitness [^113sg8UU] [^1125WyWk].

---

## Patient adherence and long-term outcomes

Adherence is critical; attending ≥ 25 sessions is linked to **lower mortality and improved quality of life** [^116FwJyr]. Barriers include symptoms, comorbidities, and access; addressing these improves adherence and outcomes [^11387Dxh].

---

## Comparison with other interventions

Exercise compares favorably with pharmacotherapy and revascularization: it achieves **symptom relief and functional gains comparable to antianginal drugs** [^113fwhca] and, in some studies, to PCI for symptom improvement and event-free survival [^111acBks] [^115tLzZF]. It also enhances the benefits of optimal medical therapy and can reduce the need for revascularization [^115tLzZF].

---

## Limitations and considerations

Evidence specific to stable angina is limited; **larger RCTs are needed** [^112xmqkW] [^116eQidQ]. Patients with severe comorbidities may require modified programs, and sustaining long-term adherence remains challenging [^113aJgjw].

---

Regular exercise is a **cornerstone of stable angina management**, improving symptoms, quality of life, and cardiovascular risk, with guideline-supported, supervised programs yielding the greatest benefits [^113rqHJK] [^112KsDp2].

Background

A previous Cochrane review has shown that exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation (CR) can benefit myocardial infarction and post-revascularisation patients. However, the impact on stable angina remains unclear and guidance is inconsistent. Whilst recommended in the guidelines of American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association and the European Society of Cardiology, in the UK the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) states that there is "no evidence to suggest that CR is clinically or cost-effective for managing stable angina".

Objectives

To assess the effects of exercise-based CR compared to usual care for adults with stable angina.

Search Methods

We updated searches from the previous Cochrane review 'Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation for patients with coronary heart disease' by searching the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, DARE, CINAHL and Web of Science on 2 October 2017. We searched two trials registers, and performed reference checking and forward-citation searching of all primary studies and review articles, to identify additional studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with a follow-up period of at least six months, which compared structured exercise-based CR with usual care for people with stable angina.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed the risk of bias and extracted data according to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. Two review authors also independently assessed the quality of the evidence using GRADE principles and we presented this information in a 'Summary of findings' table.

Main Results

Seven studies (581 participants) met our inclusion criteria. Trials had an intervention length of 6 weeks to 12 months and follow-up length of 6 to 12 months. The comparison group in all trials was usual care (without any form of structured exercise training or advice) or a no-exercise comparator. The mean age of participants within the trials ranged from 50 to 66 years, the majority of participants being male (range: 74% to 100%). In terms of risk of bias, the majority of studies were unclear about their generation of the randomisation sequence and concealment processes. One study was at high risk of detection bias as it did not blind its participants or outcome assessors, and two studies had a high risk of attrition bias due to the numbers of participants lost to follow-up. Two trials were at high risk of outcome reporting bias. Given the high risk of bias, small number of trials and participants, and concerns about applicability, we downgraded our assessments of the quality of the evidence using the GRADE tool. Due to the very low-quality of the evidence base, we are uncertain about the effect of exercise-based CR on all-cause mortality (risk ratio (RR) 1.01, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.18 to 5.67; 195 participants; 3 studies; very low-quality evidence), acute myocardial infarction (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.07 to 1.63; 254 participants; 3 studies; very low-quality evidence) and cardiovascular-related hospital admissions (RR 0.14, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.1; 101 participants; 1 study; very low-quality evidence). We found low-quality evidence that exercise-based CR may result in a small improvement in exercise capacity compared to control (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.45, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.70; 267 participants; 5 studies, low-quality evidence). We were unable to draw conclusions about the impact of exercise-based CR on quality of life (angina frequency and emotional health-related quality-of-life score) and CR-related adverse events (e.g. skeletomuscular injury, cardiac arrhythmia), due to the very low quality of evidence. No data were reported on return to work.

Authors' Conclusions

Due to the small number of trials and their small size, potential risk of bias and concerns about imprecision and lack of applicability, we are uncertain of the effects of exercise-based CR compared to control on mortality, morbidity, cardiovascular hospital admissions, adverse events, return to work and health-related quality of life in people with stable angina. Low-quality evidence indicates that exercise-based CR may result in a small increase in exercise capacity compared to usual care. High-quality, well-reported randomised trials are needed to assess the benefits and harms of exercise-based CR for adults with stable angina. Such trials need to collect patient-relevant outcomes, including clinical events and health-related quality of life. They should also assess cost-effectiveness, and recruit participants that are reflective of the real-world population of people with angina.

Conclusions

The results of this systematic review and meta-analysis show that exercise-based CR may improve short-term exercise capacity in patients with stable angina pectoris. There is insufficient evidence to draw conclusions for any other outcome. Given the limited body of available evidence, well-designed RCTs in a contemporary patient population are required to definitely assess the impact of adding CR to usual care in terms of mortality, morbidity, HRQoL and costs.

A recent review that focused on contemporary exercise-based CR found no improvement in all-cause mortality and potential benefit on hospital admissions.

A recent Cochrane review from 2019of exercise-based CR identified 44 RCTs that included 5783 people with HF. The findings show important benefits of exercise-based rehabilitation that include a probable reduction in the risk of overall hospital admissions in the short term (RR: 0.7, 95% CI 0.6 to 0.83), as well as the potential for reduction in HF admissions (RR: 0.59 95% CI 0.42 to 0.84) compared with usual care control. The effect of exercise-based rehabilitation on HRQoL is uncertain due to very low-quality evidence. Exercise-based rehabilitation may make little or no difference in all-cause mortality in trials with follow-up less than 12 months.

Strengths and limitations

We believe this to be the first systematic review and meta-analysis to specifically assess the impact of CR in patients with stable angina. Strengths of this review include extensive literature searches, consideration of RCTs, application of Cochrane review methodology and consideration of a wide range of outcomes. However, a major limitation was the small number of RCTs and patients included in the studies. It was therefore not possible to assess potential small study effects and publication bias. Trials generally recruited primarily younger middle-aged men, limiting external generalisability. A number of the trials were in patient populations with poorly defined baseline characteristics in terms of their angiographic coronary disease and left ventricular ejection fraction and were not receiving contemporary medical therapy (ie, antiplatelet, antianginal and revascularisation therapies).

Implications for clinical practice and future research

It is estimated that stable angina is prevalent in over 1.3 million people in the UK, and in approximately 112 million people, or 1.6% of the population worldwide. The findings of this review support NICE clinical guidance that there is currently insufficient evidence to conclude whether CR is clinically effective or cost-effective for stable angina.

Adequately powered, high-quality, multi-centre randomised trials of exercise-based CR in patients with stable angina receiving contemporary medical care are required. Such trials should seek to compare CR to contemporary usual care, assessing outcomes that include symptom burden with validated angina questionnaires and HRQoL measures, report clinical events including hospital admissions, all-cause mortality, and, costs and cost-effectiveness.

### Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation for stable angina: systematic review and meta-analysis [^111pi9Jv]. Open Heart (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

A systematic review was undertaken to assess the effects of exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation (CR) for patients with stable angina.

Methods

Databases (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase and CINAHL) were searched up to October 2017, without language restriction. Randomised trials comparing CR programmes with no exercise control in adults with stable angina were included. Where possible, study outcomes were pooled using meta-analysis. Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation was used to assess the quality of evidence. The protocol was published on the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews.

Results

Seven studies (581 patients), with a median of 12-month follow-up, were included. The effect of exercise-based CR on all-cause mortality (risk ratio (RR) 1.01, 95% CI: 0.18 to 5.67), acute myocardial infarction (RR 0.33, 95%CI: 0.07 to 1.63) and cardiovascular-related hospital admissions (RR 0.14, 95%CI: 0.02 to 1.1) relative to control were uncertain. We found low-quality evidence that exercise-based CR results in a moderate improvement in exercise capacity (standard mean difference 0.45, 95%CI: 0.20 to 0.70). There was limited and very low-quality evidence for the effect of exercise-based CR on health-related quality of life (HRQoL), adverse events and costs. No data were identified on cost-effectiveness or return to work.

Conclusions

Exercise-based CR may improve the short-term exercise capacity of patients with stable angina pectoris. Well-designed randomised controlled trials are needed to definitely determine the impact of CR on outcomes including mortality, morbidity, HRQoL, and costs in the population of patients with stable angina receiving contemporary medical therapy.

### Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation for stable angina: systematic review and meta-analysis [^115yGEmF]. Open Heart (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

With increasing numbers of patients living longer with symptomatic coronary heart disease (CHD), the effectiveness and accessibility of health services for patients with CHD have never been more important. Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) is recognised as integral to the comprehensive care of patients with CHD.CR is a process by which patients, in partnership with health professionals, are encouraged and supported to achieve and maintain optimal physical health. While physical exercise training is at the centre of rehabilitation provision for CR, it is now accepted that programmes should be comprehensive in nature and also include education and psychological care, as well as focus on health and life-style behaviour change and psychosocial well-being.

Stable angina is a form of chronic heart disease associated with ill health and increased death rates and is defined in this review as chest pain and associated symptoms precipitated by activity (eg, running, walking) with minimal or non-existent symptoms at rest. It was estimated that in 2013 over 1.3 million people in the UK had anginaand it was thought to affect approximately 112 million people, or 1.6% of the population worldwide. Although clinical guidelines consistently recommend referral for CR for post-myocardial infarction (MI) and patients with heart failure (HF), advice for patients with stable angina is less clear. The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association give a Class I recommendation that medically supervised CR programmes and physician-directed, home-based programme are offered to at-risk patients with stable CHD including those with stable angina, at first diagnosis. Similarly, the European Society of Cardiology recommends that people with stable CHD, including stable angina, should undergo 'moderate-to-vigorous intensity aerobic exercise training ≥ 3 times a week and for 30 min per session'. However, National Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guideline for the management of stable angina (CG126) states that there is 'no evidence to suggest that CR is clinically or cost-effective for managing stable angina'.

To inform current practice and policy, we therefore sought to undertake a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) to assess the effects of exercise-based CR versus usual care on mortality, morbidity, hospital admissions, exercise capacity, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), adverse events and return to work for adults with stable angina.

### Physical activity in patients with stable coronary heart disease: an international perspective [^116SCHY1]. European Heart Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Regular exercise and greater physical fitness are associated with lower cardiovascular and total mortality, both in healthy populations, – and in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD)and heart failure. In meta-analyses of randomized clinical trials, exercise training after myocardial infarction improves quality of life and reduces the risk of recurrent myocardial infarction and death. For most CHD patients, the benefits of increasing physical activity are likely to outweigh the small risk of exercise triggering myocardial infarction or sudden death. Clinical practice guidelines therefore recommend that patients with CHD engage in regular moderate intensity exercise, which is usually defined as 30 min on most days of the week. –

Currently there are limited data on the reasons why many CHD patients are sedentary. Coronary heart disease patients with symptoms such as angina, dyspnoea, and fatigue during exercise would be expected to engage in less exercise. Change in usual levels of physical activity could also be influenced by the psychological consequences of CHD, and by professional and other advice given to the patient. Sedentary behaviour may also partly reflect longstanding exercise patterns which predate the diagnosis of CHD. Social, economic, and cultural factors may also be important. A better understanding of the relative importance of these various factors may help inform the development of more effective interventions.

The aim of this study was to determine the degree to which sedentary behaviours are related to an individual's general health, to symptoms that develop during exercise, and to broader societal factors associated with education level, race, and country of residence. The study population is the large international cohort of patients with stable CHD participating in the Stabilisation of Atherosclerotic Plaque By Initiation of Darapladib Therapy (STABILITY) trial.

### Benefits outweigh the risks: a consensus statement on the risks of physical activity for people living with long-term conditions [^1125WyWk]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Cardiac chest pain

The long-term benefits of increasing regular physical activity far outweigh the temporary, slight increased risk of adverse events even in those experiencing exertional chest pain as a result of ischaemic heart disease (angina). This risk increases with advancing age and exercise intensity, but overall remains very low. People should be counselled individually to gradually increase physical activity, taking into account severity of symptoms and fear of cardiac chest pain. Exercise is a good treatment option for stable angina to stimulate angiogenesis. However, increasing frequency and severity of angina should prompt a medical review with no further increase in physical activity.

In the 6 weeks after an acute cardiac event or cardiac surgery, all physical activity advice should be delivered by specialist services and outside of this document's scope. There is an increased risk of an acute cardiac event in previously sedentary individuals with known cardiovascular disease who undertake unaccustomed vigorous intensity exercise. The increased risk is present both during the activity and for 1–2 hours afterwards. However, the absolute risk of a cardiovascular event during physical activity is very low. The incidence of sudden cardiac death has been reported as 1 in every 1.5 million episodes of vigorous physical activity in menand every 36.5 million hours of moderate/vigorous exertion in women. Reports suggest a 6–17 times increased risk of non-fatal acute myocardial infarction and sudden cardiac death during vigorous-intensity physical activity, compared with being sedentary. This risk reduces as physical activity levels are increased and cardiovascular fitness improves. It is essential that levels of physical activity are increased gradually.

### Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation for stable angina: systematic review and meta-analysis [^113pDLfX]. Open Heart (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This systematic review identified seven RCTs in 581 patients with a confirmed diagnosis of stable angina that compared exercise-based CR with a no exercise control. Meta-analysis and GRADE analysis showed there may be an improvement in exercise capacity following CR compared with control in the short term (up to 12 months follow-up, low-quality evidence). However, there was insufficient evidence to be able to definitely assess impact of CR on mortality, morbidity, or HRQoL.

The limited evidence base for CR for stable angina identified by this review is in contrast to that reported for post-MI, following coronary revascularisation, and in patients with HF. A Cochrane meta-analysis of exercise-based CR for CHD identified 63 RCTs in 14 486 patients, the majority following MI or coronary revascularisation. Compared with no-exercise control, the authors reported that CR reduced the risk of cardiovascular mortality (risk ratio (RR) 0.74, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.86 and hospital admission (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.96) and improved HRQoL. A systematic review and meta-analysis comparing the effects of home-based and supervised centre-based CR found similar benefits in terms of clinical and HRQoL outcomes at equivalent cost for patients with HF and following MI and revascularisation. The precise mechanisms by which CR may improve mortality in people with CHD has not been fully elucidated. Exercise training has been shown to have direct benefits on the heart and coronary vasculature, including autonomic tone, endothelial function, myocardial oxygen demand, coagulation and clotting factors, inflammatory markers, and the development of coronary collateral vessels. However, it has been suggested that approximately half of the 28% reduction in cardiac mortality in people with CHD may also be mediated via the indirect effects of exercise through improvements in the risk factors for atherosclerotic disease (ie, smoking, blood pressure and total cholesterol).

### Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation for stable angina: systematic review and meta-analysis [^111ancMr]. Open Heart (2019). Medium credibility.

Methods

We conducted and reported this systematic review in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement and the Cochrane Handbook for Interventional Reviews. The protocol was published on the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews.

Searches

We adapted the search strategy based on the Cochrane systematic review of exercise-based CR for CHD. We searched databases using a strategy combining selected Medical Subject HeadingsMeSH terms and free-text terms relating to exercise-based rehabilitation and stable angina, with filters applied to limit to RCTs. Electronic searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL plus others (see online supplementary document A) were performed. Databases were searched up to September 2016 with no language or other restrictions, and then updated with a further search up to October 2017. Trial registers (and) were also checked, in addition to reference lists of all eligible studies and other published systematic reviews.

Study selection

We included randomised trials (individual or cluster) directly comparing CR programmes with a no exercise control or usual care comparison. The study population included adults with stable or exertional angina (effort-induced chest discomfort), who were being treated with medical anti-anginal therapy and who may have had a MI, coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). We excluded patients in the immediate period following such an event that is, within 3 months of previous MI, CABG or PCI. We also excluded patients with unstable angina (pain at rest) and those with refractory angina for whom revascularisation was planned.

Studies with one or more of the following outcome measures with ≥ 6 month-follow-up were included: mortality (cardiac and overall); morbidity (reinfarction, revascularisation or cardiac-related hospitalisation); exercise capacity; HRQoL, adverse events (withdrawal from the trial or exercise programme); return to work. Selection of studies involved the initial screening of titles and abstracts, followed by an assessment of the full-text reports of all potentially relevant trials. Two authors (AD and LA) independently assessed trials for inclusion and where there was a disagreement, the opinion of a third author (RST, GH or MG) was sought.

### Physical activity in patients with stable coronary heart disease: an international perspective [^11387Dxh]. European Heart Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Aims

Despite the known benefits of regular exercise, the reasons why many coronary heart disease (CHD) patients engage in little physical activity are not well understood. This study identifies factors associated with low activity levels in individuals with chronic CHD participating in the STABILITY study, a global clinical outcomes trial evaluating the lipoprotein phospholipaseA 2 inhibitor darapladib.

Methods and results

Prior to randomization, 15 486 (97.8%) participants from 39 countries completed a lifestyle questionnaire. Total physical activity was estimated from individual subject self-reports of hours spend each week on mild, moderate, and vigorous exercise, corresponding approximately to 2, 4, and 8 METS, respectively. Multivariate logistic regression evaluated clinical and demographic variables for the lowest compared with higher overall exercise levels, and for individuals who decreased rather than maintained or increased activity since diagnosis of CHD. The least active 5280 subjects (34%) reported exercise of ≤ 24MET.h/week. A total of 7191 subjects (46%) reported less exercise compared with before diagnosis of CHD. The majority of participants were either 'not limited' or 'limited a little' walking 100 m (84%), climbing one flight of stairs (82%), or walking 1 km/½ mile (68%), and < 10% were limited 'a lot' by dyspnoea or angina. Variables independently associated with both low physical activity and decreasing exercise after diagnosis of CHD included more co-morbid conditions, poorer general health, fewer years of education, race, and country (P < 0.001 for all).

Conclusion

In this international study, low physical activity was only partly explained by cardiovascular symptoms. Potentially modifiable societal and health system factors are important determinants of physical inactivity in patients with chronic CHD.

In a case control study evaluating multiple CV risk factors for acute myocardial infarction (MI) across 52 countries, regular exercise was associated with a 14% lower risk of MI among men and women of all age groups and ethnicities. 47 Conversely, lack of PA accounted for 12% of the population‐attributable risk of an acute event. More recently, in a meta‐analysis of 33 studies, a dose‐response relationship of PA and CAD was noted; a 20% risk reduction in individuals engaging in 300 minutes per week of moderate‐intensity activity was documented. 48

A number of benefits of exercise in patients with established CAD have been observed. Regular exercise contributes to greater functional capacity and higher thresholds of angina presentation. At the myocardial level, the effects of exercise may include retardation of disease progression and regression of coronary plaques, improvements in endothelial function, favorable mechanisms for healing endothelial damage, coronary collateralization, and a positive effect on left ventricular function and remodeling. 49 Following MI, exercise training exerts the greatest benefits on ejection fraction and left ventricular volumes when started as early as 1 week after the acute episode and lasting longer than 3 months. 50

With respect to hard endpoints, there is consistent evidence that exercise in the context of cardiac rehabilitation programs is associated with lower CV mortality in patients after MI or after coronary revascularisation. In a large meta‐analysis of 63 studies examining variable intensities and periods of aerobic exercise as part of cardiac rehabilitation in patients post‐MI or revascularization, a 26% reduction in CV death and an 18% reduction in hospital admissions was documented. 51 In contrast, data on such benefits in patients with stable CAD are limited by the small number of studies and small number of participants and a review of 7 studies and 581 patients with stable CAD failed to show an additional benefit of exercise‐based cardiac rehabilitation regarding mortality, acute events, or hospitalisations. 52 Interestingly, some data have shown that in patients with CAD, high levels of PA may be harmful. An analysis of patients with stable CAD after an acute event or revascularisation procedure documented a reverse J‐shaped association of PA with CV mortality over a 10‐year period. 53 Patients who performed 5 times the exercise recommendations showed more than a double risk of CV mortality compared to those active two to four times per week. Therefore, individuals with CAD who aspire to perform high‐volume or intensity of exercise should be evaluated thoroughly to exclude inducible myocardial ischaemia, left ventricular dysfunction, and exercise related arrhythmias. 54

### Clinical evidence for a health benefit from cardiac rehabilitation: an update [^111Uyj7L]. American Heart Journal (2006). Low credibility.

The recent decision by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to expand the indications for cardiac rehabilitation (CR) provides an opportunity to review the clinical evidence of the efficacy of exercise in the CR setting for patients who have experienced an acute myocardial infarction, coronary artery bypass graft surgery, stable angina, percutaneous coronary intervention, chronic heart failure, cardiac transplant, or cardiac valve repair/replacement. Evidence shows that physician-directed, exercise-based CR positively affects the basic pathophysiology of coronary artery disease, the extent of disability and level of quality of life, and the ability to potentially impact events of both morbidity and mortality. The role of CR, including regular exercise, lifestyle modification, and appropriate medical therapy, is effective in younger and older men and women with cardiac diagnoses. The efficacy of this important therapeutic modality warrants its more widespread application.

### Percutaneous coronary angioplasty compared with exercise training in patients with stable coronary artery disease: a randomized trial [^111acBks]. Circulation (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Regular exercise in patients with stable coronary artery disease has been shown to improve myocardial perfusion and to retard disease progression. We therefore conducted a randomized study to compare the effects of exercise training versus standard percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stenting on clinical symptoms, angina-free exercise capacity, myocardial perfusion, cost-effectiveness, and frequency of a combined clinical end point (death of cardiac cause, stroke, CABG, angioplasty, acute myocardial infarction, and worsening angina with objective evidence resulting in hospitalization).

Methods and Results

A total of 101 male patients aged ≤ 70 years were recruited after routine coronary angiography and randomized to 12 months of exercise training (20 minutes of bicycle ergometry per day) or to PCI. Cost efficiency was calculated as the average expense (in US dollars) needed to improve the Canadian Cardiovascular Society class by 1 class. Exercise training was associated with a higher event-free survival (88% versus 70% in the PCI group, P = 0.023) and increased maximal oxygen uptake (+16%, from 22.7 ± 0.7 to 26.2 ± 0.8 mL O2/kg, P < 0.001 versus baseline, P < 0.001 versus PCI group after 12 months). To gain 1 Canadian Cardiovascular Society class, 6956 dollars was spent in the PCI group versus 3429 dollars in the training group (P < 0.001).

Conclusions

Compared with PCI, a 12-month program of regular physical exercise in selected patients with stable coronary artery disease resulted in superior event-free survival and exercise capacity at lower costs, notably owing to reduced rehospitalizations and repeat revascularizations.

### Physical activity in the prevention and treatment of coronary artery disease [^115tLzZF]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Physical Activity as a Key Element of Secondary Prevention in CAD

Historically, numerous patients were immobilized after acute myocardial infarction for weeks, despite compelling evidence of the protective effects of regular physical activity in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease. 3 This recommendation was based on the assumption that short‐term exercise‐induced increases in blood pressure, and consequently wall stress, might carry the risk of rupture in the infarcted wall or induce cardiac decompensation or life‐threatening arrhythmias. However, this suggested immobilization was associated with further reductions in both quality of life and exercise capacity.

Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is still considered the treatment of choice in clinical practice in patients with stable CAD, despite the fact that clear data showing a survival benefit in those treated with PCI are missing. 66 Thus, current guidelines do not recommend PCI in patients with CAD without proof of myocardial ischemia (> 10% of the myocardium) or proof of hemodynamic relevance of the stenosis detected by fractional flow reserve. 67 In contrast, physical activity performed on a regular basis has been proved to blunt symptoms, improve myocardial perfusion, and, most important, reduce mortality in patients with CAD/myocardial infarction. A meta‐analysis in 8940 patients, who had either experienced myocardial infarction, undergone coronary revascularization, complained about angina pectoris, or had CAD documented by angiography, from 48 studies revealed a decline in total and cardiovascular mortality by 20% and 26%, respectively, as a result of exercise training intervention. 6 On the basis of these findings, Hambrecht et al 68 conducted a trial comparing PCI, including stent implantation with regular physical exercise training, in patients with CAD who were already receiving optimal medical therapy. Patients with significant stenosis of the left main or proximal left anterior descending artery were excluded. 68 The aim of the study was to determine the effects of these interventions on symptoms, angina‐free exercise capacity, myocardial perfusion, cost, and the occurrence of a combined clinical end point of death from any cause, stroke, coronary artery bypass grafting, angioplasty, acute myocardial infarction, or worsening of angina leading to hospitalization. A total of 102 patients underwent randomization to PCI or exercise training (at least 20 minutes daily) for 12 months. Patients in the exercise training group had an 18% higher event‐free survival rate at 12 months' follow‐up than those with PCI, which was driven by a reduction in repeated revascularizations, and these patients were characterized by an increase in peak oxygen uptake of 16%. In contrast, the PCI group did not experience enhanced exercise capacity despite the fact that symptom relief occurred much earlier than in the exercise training group, suggesting that relief of symptoms was not associated with increased physical activity in these patients. 68 Even if PCI is the first line of therapy, patients still benefit from an exercise training program after the coronary intervention. The ETICA (Exercise Training Intervention After Coronary Angioplasty) trial clearly revealed an increase in peak oxygen uptake of 26%, an improvement in quality of life of 27%, and a reduction in cardiac events of 20%, including a reduction in myocardial infarctions and a lower number of hospital admissions, in patients who underwent a physical exercise training program after successful PCI compared with those who remained sedentary. 69 However, the previously mentioned meta‐analysis did not find a reduced incidence of nonfatal myocardial infarctions with exercise training. 6

Data extraction and risk of bias assessment

The following information was extracted: study design, participants (baselinecharacteristics), details of the intervention (including type, frequency, duration and intensity of exercise training and nature of co-interventions), length of follow-up and outcome results. We assessed study risk of bias using the Cochrane standard criteria(random sequence generation and allocation concealment, dropouts and withdrawals, outcome blinding, and selective reporting) and two further items deemed relevant to this review (balance of groups at baseline and if the study groups received comparable care (apart from the exercise component of the intervention)). These criteria, agreed on in advance by the review authors, have not been validated but have been used to assess quality in previous CR reviews

Data extraction and risk of bias assessment were carried out independently by three authors (LL, JH and AD). Any disagreements were resolved by consensus and decisions were independently checked by a third author (RST). Where necessary, authors of included studies were contacted for further information (eg, when a study was identified as abstract only).

HRQoL

One study(94 participants) reported HRQoL using validated disease-specific instruments (Seattle angina questionnaire and MacNew questionnaire). Compared with control, improvements with CR at the 6-week follow-up were seen in emotional score (p = 0.04) and angina frequency (p = 0.002). Benefits in favour of CR in angina frequency (P = 0.02) and social HRQoL score (p = 0.02) were also observed at the 6-month follow-up. We are uncertain of the effect of CR on HRQoL due to very low-quality evidence (Summary of findings table 3).

Severity of angina

One study(42 participants) reported a reduction in mean New York Heart Association (NYHA) score from baseline to 1-year follow-up (2.6–1.4, p < 0.0001) with CR and an increase in mean NYHA in control (2.3–2.9, p ≤ 0.004). Another study(101 participants) reported an improvement in angina severity assessed by mean Canadian Cardiovascular Society score in both CR (1.5–0.4, p < 0.001) and control (1.7–0.7, p < 0.001). We assessed the evidence as very low‐quality using GRADE because of concerns about risk of bias (random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of outcome assessment, selective reporting, high losses to follow‐up and unbalanced groups at baseline), concerns about applicability to review question (participants in all studies were limited to middle‐aged men) and concerns about imprecision (small number of participants). Data could not be pooled in a meta‐analysis because of scales used to report outcome measures (ie, NYHA is categorical while CCS is continuous).

Adverse events

Adverse events were only reported in one study(101 participants). The authors reported 'no adverse events' during the exercise training programme in the CR group (summary of findings in table 3).

### Trials and tribulations associated with angina and traditional therapeutic approaches [^114X2r15]. Clinical Cardiology (2007). Low credibility.

Ischemic heart disease is the foremost cause of death in the United States and the developed countries. Stable angina is the initial manifestation of ischemic heart disease in one half of the patients and becomes a recurrent symptom in survivors of myocardial infarction (MI) and other forms of acute coronary syndromes (ACS). There are multiple therapeutic modalities currently available for treatment of anginal symptoms in patients with stable CAD. These include anti-anginal drugs and myocardial revascularization procedures such as coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABGS), percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Anti-anginal drug therapy is based on treatment with nitrates, beta blockers, and calcium channel blockers. A newly approved antianginal drug, ranolazine, is undergoing phase III evaluation. Not infrequently, combination therapy is often necessary for adequate symptom control in some patients with stable angina. However, there has not been a systematic evaluation of individual or combination antianginal drug therapy on hard clinical end points in patients with stable angina. Most revascularization trials that have evaluated treatment with CABGS, PTCA, or PCI in patients with chronic CAD and stable angina have not shown significant improvement in survival or decreased incidence of non-fatal MI compared to medical treatment. In the CABGS trials, various post-hoc analyses have identified several smaller subgroups at high-risk in whom CABGS might improve clinical outcomes. However, there are conflicting findings in different reports and these findings are further compromised due to the heterogeneous groups of patients in these trials. Moreover, no prospective randomized controlled trial (RCT) has confirmed an advantage of CABGS, compared to medical treatment, in reduction of hard clinical outcomes in any of the high-risk subgroups. Based on the available data, it appears reasonable to conclude that for most patients (except perhaps in those with presence of left main disease > 50% stenosis) there is no apparent survival benefit of CABGS compared to medical therapy in stable CAD patients with angina. Although these trial have reported better symptom control associated with the revascularization intervention in most patients, this has not been adequately compared using modern medical therapies. Available data from recent studies also suggest treatment with an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), a statin and a regular exercise regimen in patients with stable CAD and angina pectoris.

Healthcare costs

One study(101 participants) reported a difference in mean participant healthcare costs in favour of CR (CR: US$3708 vs control: US$6086, p < 0.0001). These costs included hospitalisations, repeat vascularisations, any other cardiovascular events plus the costs of the provision of the CR exercise training programme. We assessed this evidence as very low‐quality using GRADE because of concerns about risk of bias (random sequence generation, allocation concealment, high losses to follow‐up and selective reporting), concerns about applicability to review question (participants in all studies were limited to middle‐aged men) and concerns about imprecision (small number of participants). We are uncertain of the effect of CR on healthcare costs due to very low-quality evidence.

None of the included studies reported on return to work (summary of findings in table 3)

Small study bias

Data analysis

Data were analysed in accordance with the Cochrane Handbook. For dichotomous variables, relative risks (RRs) and 95% CIs were calculated for each outcome, and for continuous variables, mean differences (MDs) and 95% CIs were calculated. Given the variety of outcome measures reported for exercise capacity, to allow us to pool findings across studies, between-group results for each study were expressed as a standard MD (SMD). Where differences between groups for each individual trial were not reported, we calculated p values for the differences.

We explored heterogeneity among the included studies qualitatively (by comparing the study characteristics) and quantitatively (using the χ² test of heterogeneity and I² statistic). Where appropriate, an overall estimate of treatment effect was obtained by combining the results from included studies for each outcome. We employed a random-effects model where there was formal evidence of statistical heterogeneity (ie, χ² test p value < 0.10 and I² statistic of 50%–90%). For outcomes with lower levels of statistical heterogeneity, we applied both fixed and random effects models, reporting fixed-effects results unless there was a difference in statistical inference, where we reported the most conservative random-effects model. We sought to explore small-study bias and the potential for publication bias using funnel plot and the Egger test

Analyses were undertake using Review Manager Software V.5.3 (Nordic Cochrane Group, Copenhagen, Denmark).

Summary of findings table

Two reviewers (LL and RST) independently employed the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approachto interpret result findings. We used the five GRADE considerations (study limitations, consistency of effect, imprecision, indirectness and publication bias) to assess the quality of a body of evidence from studies that contributed data to the meta-analyses and narrative summaries for the pre-specified outcomes. Any discrepancies in judgements were resolved through discussion. One reviewer (LL) used GRADEpro GDT 2015 to import data from Review Manager to create a 'Summary of findings' table using the following pre-specified outcomes: all-cause mortality; MI; all-cause hospital admissions; HRQoL, return to work and exercise capacity.

### Guidelines for the management of patients with chronic stable angina: treatment [^117XfQQ2]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

The dual aims of treating patients with chronic stable angina are 1) to reduce morbidity and mortality and 2) to eliminate angina with minimal adverse effects and allow the patient to return to normal activities. In the absence of contraindications, beta-blockers are recommended as initial therapy. All beta-blockers seem to be equally effective. If the patient has serious contraindications to beta-blockers, unacceptable side effects, or persistent angina, calcium antagonists should be administered. Long-acting dihydropyridine and nondihydropyridine agents are generally as effective as beta-blockers in relieving angina. Long-acting nitrates are considered third-line therapy because a nitrate-free interval is required to avoid developing tolerance. All long-acting nitrates seem to be equally effective. Patients with angina should take 75 to 325 mg of aspirin daily unless they have contraindications. Such risk factors as smoking, elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level, diabetes, and hypertension should be treated appropriately. Coronary revascularization has not been shown to improve survival for most patients with chronic angina but may be required to control symptoms. However, coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is often indicated for symptomatic patients with left-main disease, three-vessel disease, or two-vessel disease including proximal stenosis of the left anterior descending coronary artery; it improves their survival. Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty is an alternative to CABG for patients with normal left ventricular function and favorable angiographic features. Coronary artery bypass grafting is initially more effective in relieving angina than medical therapy, but the two procedures yield similar results after 5 to 10 years. Eighty percent of patients who undergo CABG remain angina-free 5 years after surgery. In low-risk patients, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty seems to control angina better than medical therapy, but recurrent angina and repeated procedures are more likely than with CABG. Patient education is an important component of management. Long-term follow-up should be individualized to ascertain clinical stability at regular intervals and to reassess prognosis when warranted.

Morbidity

Three studies(254 participants) reported on the incidence of MI with a total of six events. There was a pooled RR for risk of MI of 0.33 (95% CI: 0.07 to 1.63, I² = 0%, fixed effects). We are uncertain if CR has little or no effect on the incidence of MI due to very low-quality evidence (Summary of findings table 3).

Three studies(256 participants) reported on the incidence of revascularisations with a total of 28 events. In total, six revascularisations were reported among the CR groups in the three studies, and 22 in the control groups, with a pooled RR for risk of revascularisations of 0.27 (95% CI: 0.11 to 0.64, I² = 0%, fixed effects). We are uncertain if CR has little or no effect on the incidence of revascularisations due to very low-quality evidence (Summary of findings table 3).

One study(101 participants) reported that one CR participant and seven control participants experienced cardiovascular-related hospital admissions (RR 0.14, 95% CI: 0.02 to 1.10). We are uncertain if CR has little or no effect on the incidence of cardiovascular-related hospital admissions due to very low-quality evidence (Summary of findings table 3). None of the included studies reported all-cause hospital admissions.

Exercise capacity

Five studies(267 participants) reported exercise capacity with a range of validated measures (peak oxygen uptake and exercise duration) (figure 3). CR may result in a moderate improvement in exercise capacity with CR compared with control in the short term (6–12 months follow-up) (SMD 0.45, 95% CI: 0.20 to 0.70; I² = 16%, fixed effects) (figure 3) based on low-quality evidence (Summary of findings table 3). Studies varied in degree of losses to follow-up which ranged from 0%to 29%in the intervention arm.

1.9 Exercise

Patients with CCD should engage in regular physical exercise. At least 150 min of moderate‐intensity aerobic activities per week or at least 75 min of high‐intensity aerobic activities per week is recommended to enhance functional capacity and quality of life (QOL) while reducing hospital admissions and mortality rates. In addition, patients are encouraged to engage in resistance or strength training exercises at least twice a week, which not only boosts muscle strength but also improves functional capacity, if no contraindications are present.

Contraindications to exercise in patients with severe, potentially fatal, and unstable conditions include conditions such as unstable angina and other high‐risk cardiovascular disorders including advanced arrhythmias, decompensated cardiac failure, or active thromboembolism. In addition, significant noncardiovascular diseases that pose immediate life risks, such as acute infections, poorly managed diabetes mellitus, terminal malignancies, or severe mental health challenges, may also preclude regular physical exercise.

1.9.1 Cardiac rehabilitation (CR)

Patients with CCD and a recent MI, PCI, CABG, stable angina, postheart transplant, or a recent spontaneous coronary artery dissection should enroll in a CR program. Those who participate in CR have significantly better outcomes compared with those who do not participate, including lower all‐cause and cardio‐vascular mortality rates, lower rehospitalization rates (total, cardiovascular, and noncardiovascular), and superior QOL.

### Physical activity after percutaneous coronary intervention for chronic total occlusion and its association with health status [^117RjTQS]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Successful treatment of CAD involves multiple interventions beyond pharmacologic therapy and coronary revascularization and should include lifestyle changes such as diet modification and exercise to maximize patients' functional capacity and to reduce their risk of future cardiac events. In this study of patients undergoing CTO PCI, we found that only 1 in 3 patients reported any regular exercise, but this proportion increased to more than half of patients at 12 months after CTO PCI. Importantly, we found that exercise was independently associated with improved health status at 12 months after CTO PCI and that patients who reported improved health status after CTO PCI were more likely to participate in exercise 12 months after the procedure. Specifically, among those who increased or were consistent with their exercise frequency after CTO PCI, there were clinically meaningful improvements in QoL and overall health status and fewer but statistically significant improvements in their angina and disease‐specific physical function. In total, these findings underscore the potential impact of CTO PCI in enabling patients to pursue greater levels of regular physical activity for optimization of QoL and reduction of long‐term cardiac event rates.

Regular exercise is associated with reduced cardiovascular mortality and improved QoL, 1, 3, 16 and as a result, guidelines strongly advise a minimum of 30 minutes of moderate physical activity at least 5 days a week (minimum 150 minutes/week) to reduce cardiovascular risk in patients with stable CAD. 17 Patients with CTO commonly have refractory angina, which limits their participation in exercise. In accordance with data showing improvements in health status after CTO PCI, 18 a principal indication for CTO PCI is to improve symptoms and functional capacity. 19, 20 However, no prior studies have assessed whether the improvement in symptoms and health status associated with CTO PCI is associated with greater participation in regular exercise. In the present analysis, we show that among patients who did not participate in regular exercise at baseline, a majority increased participation in regular exercise by 12 months. In addition, the proportion of those who participated in exercise levels similar to guideline recommendations doubled from baseline to 12 months. With such increase in physical activity levels, these patients are likely to reap the benefits of regular exercise participation for overall health status and, potentially, cardiovascular events. 3, 21

### Stable angina – who needs revascularisation? [^114dZXdq]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2007). Low credibility.

In the UK, about 5% of men and 3% of women have, or have had, angina. Also, estimates suggest that, each year, around 340,000 people present with the symptom for the first time. Characterised by pain or discomfort in the chest, angina is usually caused by atherosclerotic coronary artery disease and so carries an increased risk of cardiovascular complications such as myocardial infarction and death from coronary heart disease (CHD). In stable angina, the symptoms are induced by exertion, reflecting the limitation of blood supply through the narrowed arteries and the resulting myocardial ischaemia. The condition is not only potentially distressing, but may also limit daily function and quality of life. To address these problems and the elevated cardiovascular risk, standard management includes lifestyle measures (e.g. physical activity without excessive exertion, stopping smoking, weight control); tackling other cardiovascular risk factors (e.g. raised blood pressure, diabetes mellitus); and medication to control angina (e.g. nitrates, beta-blockers, calcium antagonists) and to reduce overall cardiovascular risk (e.g. aspirin, statin therapy). Where such non-invasive measures alone are inadequate, revascularisation (restoration of adequate blood supply to the heart muscle) by using coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) may also be needed. Here we discuss methods for, and difficulties in, assessing patients who present with suspected stable angina to identify those who could benefit from revascularisation.

### Nitrates as an integral part of optimal medical therapy and cardiac rehabilitation for stable angina: review of current concepts and therapeutics [^117CyE89]. Clinical Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

The goals of optimal medical therapy in patients with stable angina pectoris are to reduce the risk of cardiovascular mortality and future cardiovascular events, improve exercise capacity, and enhance quality of life. Whereas myocardial revascularization is frequently employed in the management of patients with stable angina, a variety of pharmacologic interventions are recommended as part of optimal medical management. The use of short- and rapidly-acting nitrates (eg, sublingual nitroglycerin spray and tablets) is at the core of the therapeutic armamentarium and should be integrated into optimal medical therapy for stable angina along with exercise therapy. The potential clinical implications from these observations are that prophylactic sublingual nitrates, when combined with cardiac rehabilitation, may allow the patient with angina to exercise to a greater functional capacity than without sublingual nitrates.

### Potent anti-ischaemic effects of statins in chronic stable angina: incremental benefit beyond lipid lowering? [^114NYc9B]. European Heart Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Patient population and study design

Our trial included patients similar to those frequently encountered by physicians in clinical practice. They were aged 39–82 years, most were already receiving standard anti-anginal and anti-platelet medications, and had well-controlled blood pressure. We designed our study to compare the effects of two drugs with different actions and their combination. We did not include a placebo arm for comparison with the active therapies, as it was considered unethical by the investigator sites. Previous studies have reported substantial reduction in ischaemia and angina in placebo groups of patients experiencing angina and coronary disease due in part to 'regression to the mean'. We set the threshold for ischaemic activity required for inclusion in the study at a lower level than in previous studies using AECG monitoring to reduce the likelihood of the improvements being due to this phenomenon.

All ECG analyses were conducted by core lab staff who were blinded to therapy assignment and treatment phase. Patients were recruited on the basis of TMI in normal daily life, which was also the primary outcome measure. As in our previous studies, interpretable data were obtained on episodes of ST depression from the majority of patients, with only 9.3% of randomized subjects excluded for technical reasons. We also undertook bicycle tests as a secondary measure, but this proved difficult to standardize and interpret largely due to the patients' good total exercise time at baseline and the variations between centres in the quality of records and conduct of the test.

Future studies

Medical therapy strategies are now moving towards concurrent reduction in multiple risk factors, such as blood pressure and LDL-C, because of emerging evidence for outcome benefit for this approach over individual risk-factor control. This may be due to benefits on the common vascular consequences of risk factors. We now show additional benefits of statin therapy beyond lipid lowering in a frequently encountered patient population, with substantial reduction in symptomatic and asymptomatic ischaemia. Although we did not demonstrate additional benefits with amlodipine and atorvastatin combination therapy, future studies in patients with more severe ischaemia, not controlled by a single agent, as well as of lower-dose combination treatment, will be instructive.

### Diagnosis and management of stable angina: a review [^115mKpYr]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Nearly 10 million US adults experience stable angina, which occurs when myocardial oxygen supply does not meet demand, resulting in myocardial ischemia. Stable angina is associated with an average annual risk of 3% to 4% for myocardial infarction or death. Diagnostic tests and medical therapies for stable angina have evolved over the last decade with a better understanding of the optimal use of coronary revascularization.

Observations

Coronary computed tomographic angiography is a first-line diagnostic test in the evaluation of patients with stable angina due to higher sensitivity and comparable specificity compared with imaging-based stress testing. Moreover, coronary computed tomographic angiography allows detection of nonobstructive atherosclerosis that would not be identified with other noninvasive imaging modalities, improving risk assessment and potentially triggering more appropriate allocation of preventive therapies. Novel therapies treating lipids (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors, ezetimibe, and icosapent ethyl) and type 2 diabetes (sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists) have improved cardiovascular outcomes in patients with stable ischemic heart disease when added to usual care. Randomized clinical trials showed no improvement in the rates of mortality or myocardial infarction with revascularization (largely by percutaneous coronary intervention) compared with optimal medical therapy alone, even in the setting of moderate to severe ischemia. In contrast, revascularization provides a meaningful benefit on angina and quality of life compared with antianginal therapies. Measures of the effect of angina on a patient's quality of life should be integrated into the clinic encounter to assist with the decision to proceed with revascularization.

Conclusions and Relevance

For patients with stable angina, emphasis should be placed on optimizing lifestyle factors and preventive medications such as lipid-lowering and antiplatelet agents to reduce the risk for cardiovascular events and death. Antianginal medications, such as β-blockers, nitrates, or calcium channel blockers, should be initiated to improve angina symptoms. Revascularization with percutaneous coronary intervention should be reserved for patients in whom angina symptoms negatively influence quality of life, generally after a trial of antianginal medical therapy. Shared decision-making with an informed patient is important for effective treatment of stable angina.

### Cardiac rehabilitation: effective yet underutilized in patients with cardiovascular disease [^117HpdSe]. Clinical Cardiology (2022). Medium credibility.

A randomized controlled trial of 101 men with single vessel coronary artery disease with stenosis ≥ 75% and Class 1−3 angina symptoms (using the Canadian Cardiovascular Society [CCS] classification system) with ischemia present on treadmill or nuclear stress test were randomized to percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or exercise training and followed for 1 year. There was significant improvement in clinical symptoms noted by the drop in CCS score from baseline to 12 month follow‐up in both the PCI (1.7 vs. 0.7, p < .001) and structured exercise (1.5 vs. 0.4, p < .001) groups from baseline. On follow‐up, patients randomized to the exercise group experienced a 20% increase in maximal exercise tolerance (133−159 W, p < .001) while those randomized to PCI had no change in exercise tolerance of 130 W before and after cardiac rehab. The ischemic threshold (time to signs of ischemia during stress testing including ST depressions and/or angina), increased by 30% in the exercise group (133−159 W, p < .001) and 16% in the PCI group (99−119 W, p < .05). At 12 month follow‐up, the event‐free survival was significantly higher in those randomized to exercise compared to those randomized to PCI (88% vs. 70%, p = .023). Major adverse cardiac events included stroke, target‐vessel revascularization, PCI or CABG. This study supports the recommendation of cardiac rehabilitation participation for patients with single‐vessel stable angina to not only improve symptoms but also for the reduction of other adverse cardiovascular events.

### Enhanced external counterpulsation for ischemic heart disease: what's behind the curtain? [^1143hqqx]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

Enhanced external counterpulsation (EECP) has been shown to reduce angina and to improve objective measures of myocardial ischemia in patients with refractory angina. Prospective clinical studies and large treatment registries suggest that a course of EECP is associated with prolongation of the time to exercise-induced ST-segment depression and resolution of myocardial perfusion defects, as well as with enhanced exercise tolerance and quality of life. With a growing knowledge base supporting the safety and beneficial clinical effects associated with EECP, this therapy can be considered a valuable treatment option, particularly in patients who have exhausted traditional revascularization methods and yet remain symptomatic despite optimal medical care. However, although the concept of external counterpulsation was introduced almost four decades ago, and despite growing evidence supporting the clinical benefit and safety of this therapeutic modality, little is firmly established regarding the mechanisms responsible for the beneficial effects associated with this technique. Suggested mechanisms contributing to the clinical benefit of EECP include improvement in endothelial function, promotion of coronary collateralization, enhancement of ventricular function, peripheral effects similar to those observed with regular physical exercise, and nonspecific placebo effects. This review summarizes the current evidence for a contribution of these mechanisms to the clinical benefit associated with EECP.

### Benefits of exercise training on coronary blood flow in coronary artery disease patients [^111dub9y]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Every 34 seconds an American experiences a myocardial infarction or cardiac death. Approximately 80% of these coronary artery disease (CAD)-related deaths are attributable to modifiable behaviors, such as a lack of physical exercise training (ET). Regular ET decreases CAD morbidity and mortality through systemic and cardiac-specific adaptations. ET increases myocardial oxygen demand acting as a stimulus to increase coronary blood flow and thus myocardial oxygen supply, which reduces myocardial infarction and angina. ET augments coronary blood flow through direct actions on the vasculature that improve endothelial and coronary smooth muscle function, enhancing coronary vasodilation. Additionally, ET promotes collateralization, thereby, increasing blood flow to ischemic myocardium and also treats macrovascular CAD by attenuating the progression of coronary atherosclerosis and restenosis, potentially through stabilization of atherosclerotic lesions. In summary, ET can be used as a relatively safe and inexpensive way to prevent and treat CAD.

### Physical activity after percutaneous coronary intervention for chronic total occlusion and its association with health status [^114KcjB3]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Physical activity remains an important predictor of outcomes for patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), 1 and improving functional status to allow patients to maintain an active lifestyle is a key goal of coronary revascularization. 2 Recent studies have found that even small increases in physical activity are associated with lower cardiovascular mortality in patients with stable CAD. 3 Unfortunately, patients with CAD often report lower levels of physical activity compared with those without CAD, and little is known about patterns of exercise following coronary revascularization. 4 Chronic total occlusion (CTO) of coronary arteries is common in patients with CAD and is frequently associated with significant angina burden and physical limitation (PL) that may limit exercise capacity. 4 Although successful percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for CTO (CTO PCI) has been shown to improve indexes of exercise performance, 5, 6, 7 no studies have reported whether CTO PCI is associated with increased participation in regular exercise in long‐term follow‐up after the procedure. Moreover, the association of improvements in patients' health status, a known benefit of CTO PCI, 2, 8 with exercise patterns after revascularization has never been described. To address these gaps in knowledge, we studied patient‐reported participation in regular exercise at baseline and at 12 months after CTO PCI in a large multicenter study of consecutive patients undergoing CTO PCI. We also examined the association between change in health status 12 months after CTO PCI and exercise status at 12 months to understand whether improved health status was associated with greater exercise participation.

Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) referral and delivery — directive and implementation options — are detailed. The recommendation states: All patients with CCD and appropriate indications should be referred to a cardiac rehabilitation program to improve outcomes, with scope clarified by footnotes: *With stable angina or after heart transplant; †After recent MI, PCI, or CABG; ‡After recent spontaneous coronary artery dissection event. The synopsis describes CR as a comprehensive, team-based, and evidence-based approach for individuals with CVD, notes that home-based CR have similar shorter-term safety and clinical outcomes as facility-based CR and can be considered as an alternative option for patients who cannot attend facility-based CR, and highlights that key benefits from CR have been noted to be dose-related.

### Controversies in cardiovascular medicine: chronic stable coronary artery disease: drugs vs. revascularization [^117ASSko]. European Heart Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Coronary artery disease remains the leading cause of mortality in most industrialized countries, although age-standardized mortality related to coronary artery disease (CAD) has decreased by more than 40% during the last two decades. Coronary atherosclerosis may cause angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, heart failure, arrhythmia, and sudden death. Medical management of atherosclerosis and its manifestation aims at retardation of progression of plaque formation, prevention of plaque rupture, and subsequent events and treatment of symptoms, when these occur as well as treatment of the sequelae of the disease. Revascularization by either percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG) is performed as treatment of flow-limiting coronary stenosis to reduce myocardial ischaemia. In high-risk patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS), a routine invasive strategy with revascularization in most patients provides the best outcome with a significant reduction in death and myocardial infarction compared with an initial conservative strategy. Conversely, the benefit of revascularization among patients with chronic stable CAD has been called into question. This review will provide information that revascularization exerts favourable effects on symptoms, quality of life, exercise capacity, and survival, particularly in those with extensive CAD and documented moderate-to-severe ischaemia. Accordingly, CABG and PCI should be considered a valuable adjunct rather than an alternative to medical therapy.

Characteristics and Outcomes of Key Studies Evaluating Lifestyle Interventions in Cardiovascular-Kidney-Metabolic Syndrome Stage 4

Furthermore, reduction of dietary sodium was discussed earlier as a strategy to lower blood pressure in CKM syndrome stage 1, and salt substitutes may be a complementary approach to lowering blood pressure with additional cardiovascular benefits. Substituting potassium chloride for sodium chloride, which is found in regular salt, reduces blood pressure and prevents CVD events in CKM syndrome stage 4. Specifically, in the Salt Substitute and Stroke Study, among adults with high blood pressure and either history of stroke or age ≥ 60 years, replacing regular salt with a potassium-enriched salt substitute (75% sodium chloride and 25% potassium chloride) led to a significant 14% reduction in the risk of fatal or nonfatal stroke without an increase in clinical hyperkalemia.

Adults with established coronary heart disease derive several benefits from cardiac rehabilitation, which encompasses exercise training and education. Specifically, cardiac rehabilitation reduces the risk of myocardial infarction and all-cause hospitalizations and improves the quality of life in coronary heart disease. Among patients with stable angina and coronary heart disease, exercise training combined with a low-fat diet reduced myocardial ischemia and coronary artery disease progression compared with usual care. Similar findings were observed in other RCTs of multifactorial interventions incorporating exercise, diet, and other risk factor modification that led to less progression of coronary atherosclerosis and fewer cardiac events. The mechanisms by which exercise training improves coronary outcomes are unclear. The proof-of-concept EXCITE trial indicates exercise training increases coronary collateral flow, but the interrelationships with clinical outcomes are less clear.

The classic symptom for patients with PAD is claudication, for which exercise is an effective therapy. Exercise programs reduce pain, improve quality of life, and increase walking distance among patients with claudication. In the CLEVER (Claudication: Exercise vs Endoluminal Revascularization) trial, among adults with PAD, supervised exercise led to a greater increase in peak walking time than stent revascularization at 6 months, but this difference was no longer significant at 18-month follow-up. The training intensity appears to impact outcomes in PAD such that high-intensity (vs low-intensity) walking exercise led to a greater increase in 6-minute walk distance in the LITE (Low-Intensity Exercise Intervention in PAD) trial.

### Optimizing management of stable angina: a patient-centered approach integrating revascularization, medical therapy, and lifestyle interventions [^117Stm3d]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Angina pectoris may arise from obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) or in the absence of significant CAD (ischemia with nonobstructed coronary arteries [INOCA]). Therapeutic strategies for patients with angina and obstructive CAD focus on reducing cardiovascular events and relieving symptoms, whereas in INOCA the focus shifts toward managing functional alterations of the coronary circulation. In obstructive CAD, coronary revascularization might improve angina status, although a significant percentage of patients present angina persistence or recurrence, suggesting the presence of functional mechanisms along with epicardial CAD. In patients with INOCA, performing a precise endotype diagnosis is crucial to allow a tailored therapy targeted toward the specific pathogenic mechanism. In this expert opinion paper, we review the evidence for the management of angina, highlighting the complementary role of coronary revascularization, optimal medical therapy, and lifestyle interventions and underscoring the importance of a personalized approach that targets the underlying pathobiology.

### Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation for coronary heart disease: cochrane systematic review and meta-analysis [^111zf6AB]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Although recommended in guidelines for the management of coronary heart disease (CHD), concerns have been raised about the applicability of evidence from existing meta-analyses of exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation (CR).

Objectives

The goal of this study is to update the Cochrane systematic review and meta-analysis of exercise-based CR for CHD.

Methods

The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and Science Citation Index Expanded were searched to July 2014. Retrieved papers, systematic reviews, and trial registries were hand-searched. We included randomized controlled trials with at least 6 months of follow-up, comparing CR to no-exercise controls following myocardial infarction or revascularization, or with a diagnosis of angina pectoris or CHD defined by angiography. Two authors screened titles for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. Studies were pooled using random effects meta-analysis, and stratified analyses were undertaken to examine potential treatment effect modifiers.

Results

A total of 63 studies with 14,486 participants with median follow-up of 12 months were included. Overall, CR led to a reduction in cardiovascular mortality (relative risk: 0.74; 95% confidence interval: 0.64 to 0.86) and the risk of hospital admissions (relative risk: 0.82; 95% confidence interval: 0.70 to 0.96). There was no significant effect on total mortality, myocardial infarction, or revascularization. The majority of studies (14 of 20) showed higher levels of health-related quality of life in 1 or more domains following exercise-based CR compared with control subjects.

Conclusions

This study confirms that exercise-based CR reduces cardiovascular mortality and provides important data showing reductions in hospital admissions and improvements in quality of life. These benefits appear to be consistent across patients and intervention types and were independent of study quality, setting, and publication date.

### Dipyridamole in chronic stable angina pectoris; a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study [^114fyc38]. European Heart Journal (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Oral dipyridamole induces accumulation of endogenous adenosine, which in a hypoxic milieu exerts experimentally an angiogenic effect on coronary collateral circulation. A meta-analysis of 13 randomized placebo-controlled trials published between 1960 and 1992 showed evidence of benefit for dipyridamole in the treatment of angina pectoris, especially with longer duration of treatment. Aim To assess the efficacy and safety of dipyridamole in the treatment of patients with chronic stable angina in a large scale, international, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group study.

Methods

Four hundred patients with chronic stable angina pectoris and a positive treadmill exercise test were randomized to receive either modified release dipyridamole (200 mg b.i.d. p.o., n = 198) or corresponding placebo (n = 202), for 24 weeks as an add-on to conventional antianginal therapy and for 4 additional weeks as monotherapy — the latter after withdrawal of standard treatment with calcium antagonists and/or beta-blockers and/or long-acting (prophylactic) nitrates.

Results

Of the 198 patients randomized to dipyridamole, 134 completed the add-on and only 12 the monotherapy phase. Of the 202 patients randomized to placebo, 162 reached the add-on and only 12 the monotherapy phase. Serious adverse events occurred in 15 patients with dipyridamole and in 12 with placebo (7.6% vs 6.0, P = 0.52). Increase over the baseline treadmill exercise test was similar in the treatment groups at each stage of the trial for all the main efficacy parameters: total treadmill exercise test duration; time to first anginal pain (except for a -13 s difference in favour of placebo at week 24; P = 0.040); time to ST segment depression > 0.1 mVolt (except for a +21 s difference in favour of dipyridamole at week 8; P = 0.024; this latter difference was totally attributable to patients with lower exercise tolerance — Bruce stage II at study entry).

Conclusion

In patients with chronic stable angina treated with regular antianginal background medication, the use of oral dipyridamole is safe and well tolerated. Antianginal and antiischaemic efficacy, as assessed by exercise testing, is comparable to placebo, except for a beneficial effect on time to ischaemia after 2 months, totally attributable to patients with lower exercise tolerance at study entry.

### Cardiac rehabilitation: effective yet underutilized in patients with cardiovascular disease [^113sg8UU]. Clinical Cardiology (2022). Medium credibility.

2 HISTORY

Before the 1950s, the general approach to the management of myocardial infarction was bed rest and physical inactivity. A change in this method of management started with the recommendation of cardiac chair therapy, which involved patients sitting in a chair for a 1−2 h per day. Over the following years, the recommendations included progressively more physical activity and in the 1970s a structured and supervised rehabilitation program was established. This program contained three phases. Phase I was initiated while the patient was still in the hospital after a cardiovascular event as low‐level supervised activity. This was followed by Phase II, which was supervised exercise on an outpatient basis with ECG monitoring. Next was Phase III, a community‐based or gymnasium rehabilitation plan where patients may or may not have had medical monitoring.

The American Heart Association published a statement in 1995 that delineated the required components of any cardiac rehabilitation program: (1) training in exercise with prescribed activity, (2) modification of risk factors, and (3) psychosocial assessment and counseling. In 1982, Medicare began to provide insurance coverage for cardiac rehabilitation in patients who were enrolled within one year of an acute MI, status postcoronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, or had been experiencing chronic stable angina. In 2014 Medicare expanded its coverage for cardiac rehabilitation to patients with chronic, stable heart failure who had not had a recent (within 6 weeks) hospitalization. Cardiac rehabilitation structure and indications have evolved over the years and there continues to be important and significant change. (Figure 1).

Figure 1
Cardiac rehabilitation timeline

2.1 Coronary artery disease

The first group of patients in whom cardiac rehabilitation was intended was those who had sustained an acute MI, were post‐CABG or had stable angina. In the 2021 Cochrane Review, "Exercise‐based cardiac rehabilitation for coronary heart disease", investigators analyzed 85 trials enrolling a total of 23 430 patients with coronary artery disease. They found significantly lower rates of MI and all‐cause hospitalization at 6−12 months. Moreover, at medium‐term follow‐up (> 12−36 months), and long‐term follow‐up (> 36 months) there were lower rates of MI and cardiovascular mortality in patients who had undergone cardiac rehabilitation. Lastly, at 1 year follow‐up, patients who participated in cardiac rehabilitation reported a significant improvement in health‐related quality of life.

### Physical activity in the prevention and treatment of coronary artery disease [^114tgczM]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

In primary prevention, regular physical activity decreases the incidence of cardiovascular disease. At the endothelial level, this decreased incidence was attributed to higher expression and phosphorylation of the endothelial isoform of NO synthase, which results in a more effective radical scavenger system, a rejuvenation of the endothelium by circulating progenitor cells (CPCs), and growth of preexisting coronary vessels by angiogenesis. 1, 2

Endothelial dysfunction, which precedes coronary sclerosis by many years, is the first step of a vicious cycle culminating in overt atherosclerosis, significant coronary artery disease (CAD), plaque rupture, and, finally, myocardial infarction. 1, 3 In addition to classic risk factors, such as hypertension, smoking, diabetes mellitus, and hypercholesterolemia, physical inactivity has been identified as an independent predictor for the development of CAD. 4, 5 In contrast, regular physical activity seems to be effective in the primary prevention of CAD via the modulation of classic risk factors and maintenance of endothelial function.

Once symptomatic CAD has developed, regular exercise training is a potent strategy to increase the threshold of angina‐free activity levels in stable disease conditions. Furthermore, exercise training seems to attenuate disease progression and improve event‐free survival in the secondary prevention of CAD. 6, 7 Mechanistically, numerous studies suggest that regular physical activity partially reverses endothelial alterations: it enhances the vascular production of NO, decreases the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS; which would otherwise rapidly inactivate NO), rejuvenates the endothelium by activating endogenous progenitor cells, induces the CPC‐mediated formation of new vessels by vasculogenesis, and promotes myocardial expression of vascular growth factors (which induce the remodeling of preexisting capillaries and arterioles). 1 An exercise training‐induced regression of coronary stenosis and collateral growth has been discussed as a potential mechanism that also contributes to enhanced myocardial perfusion; however, a critical review of the literature raises reasonable doubts that the magnitude of these changes is large enough to explain their survival benefit in CAD. 3, 8 Nevertheless, a limited number of recent studies indicate that regular physical activity has an inhibitory effect on platelet and leukocyte activation. 9

This review will discuss the effects of regular physical activity on vasculature in the primary and secondary prevention of CAD in humans, with a special focus on the endothelium.

Therapy

Pharmacological symptomatic therapy

A detailed review of therapy for the different disorders of coronary artery function is beyond the scope of this review. A summary of currently available therapies aligning with the different SCS disease endotypes is shown in table 2 (see additional references in online supplementary file 1). Robust evidence for the treatment of SCS is lacking. The treatment effect in many studies is potentially diluted by enrolment of heterogeneous groups of patients with distinct pathophysiological mechanisms of CMD that may respond differently to specific treatment modalities. Current European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines provide recommendations for patients with CMD suggesting ß-blockers as first-line therapy, with calcium antagonists recommended if the former is not tolerated or efficacious. Unlike in patients with angina and obstructive CAD, nitrates are not generally effective for treating SCS due to CMD. In a randomised, placebo-controlled clinical trial of ranolazine led by the WISE investigators, although there were no overall improvements in angina and MPRi with ranolazine, benefit was observed in the subgroup of patients with a reduced CFR (< 2.5) at baseline. Patients with VSA may benefit symptomatically from treatment with both nitrate and calcium channel antagonists while the latter may have prognostic benefit. Rho-kinase inhibitors and endothelin-receptor antagonists represent potential future therapeutic options.

Table 2
Treatment of SCS endotypes

Secondary prevention

ESC guidelines support the use of secondary prevention with aspirin and statin therapy. In contrast, the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guideline-95 on management of stable angina cites the enigmatic term 'Syndrome X', but guidance on the diagnosis and management is limited, reflecting the limited evidence base. Contemporary guidelines should be followed for the management of vascular risk factors in patients with INOCA. In patients with CMD, statin therapy reduces ischaemia as revealed by reduced ST-segment deviation following exercise testing and improves exercise capacity and flow-mediated dilatation in the brachial artery in patients with CMD. ACE inhibitors (ACEi) improve endothelial dysfunction and vasoreactivity via NO stimulation helping to reverse vascular hypertrophy and improve vascular compliance.

Non-pharmacological therapy

Lifestyle measures promote well-being in patients with INOCA through smoking cessation, healthy eating (eg, Mediterranean diet) and physical activity. The Comprehensive Treatment of Angina in Women With Microvascular Dysfunction trial (NCT02910154) will randomise women with angina and CMD to comprehensive multimodality intervention (dietary, exercise, and statin and ACEi therapy) or control therapy to determine whether angina and microvascular dysfunction can be improved.

### Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation for coronary heart disease: a meta-analysis [^115SoXTz]. European Heart Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Methods

We conducted and reported this meta-analysis in accordance with the Cochrane Handbook for Interventional Reviews and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses and the synthesis without meta-analysis statements, respectively.

Search strategy and study selection

We undertook update literature searches of Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and Science Citation Index Expanded from June 2014 (the search end date of the Cochrane 2016 review) to September 2020 (strategy provided in Supplementary material online, File S1). We also searched two clinical trials registers (World Health Organization's International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov), and hand-searched reference lists of retrieved articles and recent systematic reviews. Records collected from trial registry searches were used to identify trials not picked up in database searches, as well as ongoing studies. We sought RCTs of exercise-based CR (exercise training alone or in combination with psychosocial or educational interventions) compared with no-exercise or usual care control, with at least 6-month post-baseline follow-up outcome measures. All patients in both the intervention and control groups were generally reported to receive (local or national) guideline recommended medical treatment.

Two reviewers (G.O.D. and J.F.) independently confirmed trial eligibility. Disagreements were resolved by discussion or by a third reviewer (R.S.T.), if necessary.

Patient population

We included adults (≥ 18 years), in either hospital-or community-based settings, who had a myocardial infarction (MI), who had undergone revascularization [coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)], or who had angina pectoris or coronary artery disease defined by angiography.

Data abstraction and quality appraisal

Two reviewers (G.O.D. and J.F.) independently completed data extraction and assessed study quality using the Cochrane Risk of Bias (ROB) tool, which was checked by a third reviewer (R.S.T.). Trials were assessed based on random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of outcome assessment, incomplete outcome data, and selective reporting. Information regarding study methods (country, design, follow-up, and setting), participant characteristics (numbers randomized, age, sex, diagnosis, and inclusion/exclusion criteria), intervention (exercise mode, duration, frequency, intensity), and control (description, i.e. usual care, no exercise), outcomes, funding sources, and notable author conflicts of interest were obtained.

### High-intensity aerobic interval training in a patient with stable angina pectoris [^117Uhuan]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2010). Low credibility.

Recently, high-intensity aerobic interval training was shown to be more effective than continuous moderate-intensity exercise for improving maximal aerobic capacity and endurance in patients with coronary heart disease. However, patients with exercise-induced ischemia were not included in those studies. We present the acute cardiopulmonary responses of a 67-yr-old man with stable angina pectoris during a 34-min session of high-intensity aerobic interval training. Exercise was well tolerated with neither significant arrhythmia nor elevation of cardiac troponin-T. We observed a complete disappearance of symptoms and signs of myocardial ischemia after 24 mins of exercise. This observation is similar to the warm-up angina phenomenon, an adaptation to myocardial ischemia that remains poorly understood. We conclude that high-intensity aerobic interval training is a promising mode of training for patients with stable coronary heart disease that should also be investigated further in patients with exercise-induced ischemia.

### Physical activity after percutaneous coronary intervention for chronic total occlusion and its association with health status [^112L38DQ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Patients with chronic total occlusion may not participate in regular exercise because of refractory angina. Exercise participation after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for and the association of exercise with health status afteris unknown.

Methods and Results

Overall, 1000 patients enrolled in the Outcomes, Patient Health Status, and Efficiency in Chronic Total Occlusion OPEN CTO is a registry were asked about participation in regular exercise at baseline and 12 months after, and the frequency of exercise (< 1, 1–2, ≥ 3 times/week) was collected among exercisers. Health status was assessed using the Seattle Angina Questionnaire. Multivariable regression assessed 12‐month health status change across 4 groups defined by exercise frequency at baseline and 12 months after(no regular exercise at baseline and 12 months, reduced, increased, and consistent exercise at 12 months). Among 869 patients with complete exercise data, the proportion that exercised regularly increased from 33.5% at baseline to 56.6% 12 months after(P < 0.01). Predictors of regular exercise at 12 months included baseline exercise, smoking, baseline and increase inscores for angina frequency, physical limitation, quality of life, and summary. After multivariable adjustment, consistent or increased exercise frequency was associated with significantly greater improvement inscores for angina frequency, physical limitation, quality of life, and summary (P < 0.01).

Conclusions

Participation in regular exercise increased significantly 12 months after, and patients who had greater health status benefit afterwere more likely to exercise regularly at 12 months.may enable coronary artery disease patients with limiting symptoms to engage in regular exercise and to support better long‐term outcomes.

### Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation for coronary heart disease [^115GZJXh]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the single most common cause of death globally. However, with falling CHD mortality rates, an increasing number of people live with CHD and may need support to manage their symptoms and prognosis. Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation (CR) aims to improve the health and outcomes of people with CHD. This is an update of a Cochrane systematic review previously published in 2011.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of exercise-based CR (exercise training alone or in combination with psychosocial or educational interventions) compared with usual care on mortality, morbidity and HRQL in patients with CHD. To explore the potential study level predictors of the effectiveness of exercise-based CR in patients with CHD.

Search Methods

We updated searches from the previous Cochrane review, by searching Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library, Issue 6, 2014) from December 2009 to July 2014. We also searched MEDLINE (Ovid), EMBASE (Ovid), CINAHL (EBSCO) and Science Citation Index Expanded (December 2009 to July 2014).

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of exercise-based interventions with at least six months' follow-up, compared with a no exercise control. The study population comprised men and women of all ages who have had a myocardial infarction (MI), coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), or who have angina pectoris, or coronary artery disease. We included RCTs that reported at least one of the following outcomes: mortality, MI, revascularisations, hospitalisations, health-related quality of life (HRQL), or costs.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened all identified references for inclusion based on the above inclusion and exclusion criteria. One author extracted data from the included trials and assessed their risk of bias; a second review author checked data. We stratified meta-analysis by the duration of follow up of trials, i.e. short-term: 6 to 12 months, medium-term: 13 to 36 months, and long-term: > 3 years.

Main Results

This review included 63 trials which randomised 14,486 people with CHD. This latest update identified 16 new trials (3872 participants). The population included predominantly post-MI and post-revascularisation patients and the mean age of patients within the trials ranged from 47.5 to 71.0 years. Women accounted for fewer than 15% of the patients recruited. Overall trial reporting was poor, although there was evidence of an improvement in quality of reporting in more recent trials. As we found no significant difference in the impact of exercise-based CR on clinical outcomes across follow-up, we focused on reporting findings pooled across all trials at their longest follow-up (median 12 months). Exercise-based CR reduced cardiovascular mortality compared with no exercise control (27 trials; risk ratio (RR) 0.74, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.86). There was no reduction in total mortality with CR (47 trials, RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.04). The overall risk of hospital admissions was reduced with CR (15 trials; RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.96) but there was no significant impact on the risk of MI (36 trials; RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.04), CABG (29 trials; RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.16) or PCI (18 trials; RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.04). There was little evidence of statistical heterogeneity across trials for all event outcomes, and there was evidence of small study bias for MI and hospitalisation, but no other outcome. Predictors of clinical outcomes were examined across the longest follow-up of studies using univariate meta-regression. Results show that benefits in outcomes were independent of participants' CHD case mix (proportion of patients with MI), type of CR (exercise only vs comprehensive rehabilitation) dose of exercise, length of follow-up, trial publication date, setting (centre vs home-based), study location (continent), sample size or risk of bias. Given the heterogeneity in outcome measures and reporting methods, meta-analysis was not undertaken for HRQL. In five out of 20 trials reporting HRQL using validated measures, there was evidence of significant improvement in most or all of the sub-scales with exercise-based CR compared to control at follow-up. Four trial-based economic evaluation studies indicated exercise-based CR to be a potentially cost-effective use of resources in terms of gain in quality-adjusted life years. The quality of the evidence for outcomes reported in the review was rated using the GRADE method. The quality of the evidence varied widely by outcome and ranged from low to moderate.

Authors' Conclusions

This updated Cochrane review supports the conclusions of the previous version of this review that, compared with no exercise control, exercise-based CR reduces the risk of cardiovascular mortality but not total mortality. We saw a significant reduction in the risk of hospitalisation with CR but not in the risk of MI or revascularisation. We identified further evidence supporting improved HRQL with exercise-based CR. More recent trials were more likely to be well reported and include older and female patients. However, the population studied in this review still consists predominantly of lower risk individuals following MI or revascularisation. Further well conducted RCTs are needed to assess the impact of exercise-based CR in higher risk CHD groups and also those presenting with stable angina. These trials should include validated HRQL outcome measures, explicitly report clinical event outcomes including mortality and hospital admissions, and assess costs and cost-effectiveness.

### Diltiazem hydrochloride (Cardizem LA) [^112Cpm1d]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

1.1 Hypertension

CARDIZEM LA is indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes including this drug.

Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than one drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program's Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC).

Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly.

Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mm Hg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal.

Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy.

CARDIZEM LA may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive medications.

1.2 Angina

CARDIZEM LA is indicated to improve exercise tolerance in patients with chronic stable angina.

### Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation for coronary heart disease [^1142FYCu]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the most common cause of death globally. However, with falling CHD mortality rates, an increasing number of people living with CHD may need support to manage their symptoms and prognosis. Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation (CR) aims to improve the health and outcomes of people with CHD. This is an update of a Cochrane Review previously published in 2016.

Objectives

To assess the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of exercise-based CR (exercise training alone or in combination with psychosocial or educational interventions) compared with 'no exercise' control, on mortality, morbidity and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in people with CHD.

Search Methods

We updated searches from the previous Cochrane Review, by searching CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and two other databases in September 2020. We also searched two clinical trials registers in June 2021.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of exercise-based interventions with at least six months' follow-up, compared with 'no exercise' control. The study population comprised adult men and women who have had a myocardial infarction (MI), coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), or have angina pectoris, or coronary artery disease.

Data Collection and Analysis

We screened all identified references, extracted data and assessed risk of bias according to Cochrane methods. We stratified meta-analysis by duration of follow-up: short-term (6 to 12 months); medium-term (> 12 to 36 months); and long-term (> 3 years), and used meta-regression to explore potential treatment effect modifiers. We used GRADE for primary outcomes at 6 to 12 months (the most common follow-up time point). MAIN RESULTS: This review included 85 trials which randomised 23,430 people with CHD. This latest update identified 22 new trials (7795 participants). The population included predominantly post-MI and post-revascularisation patients, with a mean age ranging from 47 to 77 years. In the last decade, the median percentage of women with CHD has increased from 11% to 17%, but females still account for a similarly small percentage of participants recruited overall (< 15%). Twenty-one of the included trials were performed in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Overall trial reporting was poor, although there was evidence of an improvement in quality over the last decade. The median longest follow-up time was 12 months (range 6 months to 19 years). At short-term follow-up (6 to 12 months), exercise-based CR likely results in a slight reduction in all-cause mortality (risk ratio (RR) 0.87, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.73 to 1.04; 25 trials; moderate certainty evidence), a large reduction in MI (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.93; 22 trials; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 75, 95% CI 47 to 298; high certainty evidence), and a large reduction in all-cause hospitalisation (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.77; 14 trials; NNTB 12, 95% CI 9 to 21; moderate certainty evidence). Exercise-based CR likely results in little to no difference in risk of cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.14; 15 trials; moderate certainty evidence), CABG (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.27; 20 trials; high certainty evidence), and PCI (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.19; 13 trials; moderate certainty evidence) up to 12 months' follow-up. We are uncertain about the effects of exercise-based CR on cardiovascular hospitalisation, with a wide confidence interval including considerable benefit as well as harm (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.41 to 1.59; low certainty evidence). There was evidence of substantial heterogeneity across trials for cardiovascular hospitalisations (I² = 53%), and of small study bias for all-cause hospitalisation, but not for all other outcomes. At medium-term follow-up, although there may be little to no difference in all-cause mortality (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.02; 15 trials), MI (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.27; 12 trials), PCI (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.35; 6 trials), CABG (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.23; 9 trials), and all-cause hospitalisation (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.03; 9 trials), a large reduction in cardiovascular mortality was found (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.93; 5 trials). Evidence is uncertain for difference in risk of cardiovascular hospitalisation (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.12; 3 trials). At long-term follow-up, although there may be little to no difference in all-cause mortality (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.10), exercise-based CR may result in a large reduction in cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.78; 8 trials) and MI (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.90; 10 trials). Evidence is uncertain for CABG (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.34 to 1.27; 4 trials), and PCI (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.20; 3 trials). Meta-regression showed benefits in outcomes were independent of CHD case mix, type of CR, exercise dose, follow-up length, publication year, CR setting, study location, sample size or risk of bias. There was evidence that exercise-based CR may slightly increase HRQoL across several subscales (SF-36 mental component, physical functioning, physical performance, general health, vitality, social functioning and mental health scores) up to 12 months' follow-up; however, these may not be clinically important differences. The eight trial-based economic evaluation studies showed exercise-based CR to be a potentially cost-effective use of resources in terms of gain in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs).

Authors' Conclusions

This updated Cochrane Review supports the conclusions of the previous version, that exercise-based CR provides important benefits to people with CHD, including reduced risk of MI, a likely small reduction in all-cause mortality, and a large reduction in all-cause hospitalisation, along with associated healthcare costs, and improved HRQoL up to 12 months' follow-up. Over longer-term follow-up, benefits may include reductions in cardiovascular mortality and MI. In the last decade, trials were more likely to include females, and be undertaken in LMICs, increasing the generalisability of findings. Well-designed, adequately-reported RCTs of CR in people with CHD more representative of usual clinical practice are still needed. Trials should explicitly report clinical outcomes, including mortality and hospital admissions, and include validated HRQoL outcome measures, especially over longer-term follow-up, and assess costs and cost-effectiveness.

### Angina pectoris and atherosclerotic risk factors in the multisite cardiac lifestyle intervention program [^115FBQtD]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular symptom relief is a major indicator for revascularization procedures. To examine the effects of intensive lifestyle modification on symptom relief, we investigated changes in angina pectoris, coronary risk factors, quality of life, and lifestyle behaviors in patients with stable coronary artery disease enrolled in the multisite cardiac lifestyle intervention program, an ongoing health insurance-covered lifestyle intervention conducted at 22 sites in the united states. Patients with coronary artery disease (nonsmokers; 757 men, 395 women; mean age 61 years) were asked to make changes in diet (10% calories from fat, plant based), engage in moderate exercise (3 hours/week), and practice stress management (1 hour/day). At baseline, 108 patients (43% women) reported mild angina and 174 patients (37% women) reported limiting angina. By 12 weeks, 74% of these patients were angina free, and an additional 9% moved from limiting to mild angina. This improvement in angina was significant for patients with mild and limiting angina at baseline regardless of gender (p < 0.01). Significant improvements in cardiac risk factors, quality of life, and lifestyle behaviors were observed, and patients with angina who became angina free by 12 weeks showed the greatest improvements in exercise capacity, depression, and health-related quality of life (p < 0.05). In conclusion, the observed improvements in angina in patients making intensive lifestyle changes could drastically reduce their need for revascularization procedures.

### Benefits and risks of high-intensity interval training in patients with coronary artery disease [^114mCV2d]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation is integral to secondary prevention in patients with coronary artery disease. Recently, the effectiveness and "superiority" of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) is a purported time-saving alternative to "traditional" moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT) in cardiac rehabilitation. The rationale for HIIT adoption is, however, not fully substantiated in the scientific literature. Established guidelines for exercise testing and training, when carefully adhered to, reduce the likelihood of triggering a cardiac event or inducing musculoskeletal injury. Clinicians should likewise consider patient risk stratification and introduce HIIT as an alternative to MICT only after patients exhibit stable and asymptomatic responses to vigorous exercise training. Although HIIT adherence appears comparable with MICT during outpatient rehabilitation, compliance drops dramatically for unsupervised exercise. Despite the enthusiasm surrounding HIIT, its main advantage over MICT appears to be short-term exercise performance outcomes and indices of vascular function. Regarding benefits to cardiovascular disease risk factor modification, management of vital signs, and measures of cardiac performance, current evidence indicates that HIIT does not outperform MICT. Long-term outcomes to HIIT are currently uncertain and logistical constraints to HIIT incorporation need additional clarification. Based on these limited findings, derived from facilities and clinicians at the forefront of cardiac rehabilitation, the routine adoption of HIIT should be viewed cautiously. In conclusion, the current review highlights numerous specific research directives that are needed before the safety and effectiveness of HIIT can be confirmed and widely adopted in patients with known or suspected coronary artery disease, especially in unsupervised, nonmedical settings.

### Invasive therapy versus conservative therapy for patients with stable coronary artery disease: an updated meta-analysis [^1156rga4]. Clinical Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

2 METHODS

We performed a systematic literature search on PubMed, Cochrane, Embase and Ovid MEDLINE database from January 2000 to June 2020. Search terms included (stable coronary artery disease OR stable angina OR angina) AND (medical therapy OR conservative management OR conservative strategy) AND (PCI OR expanded PCI OR revascularization OR CABG OR surgery). Inclusion criteria were randomized controlled trials (RCTs), trials in humans and English language. Non‐randomized trials, including observational studies, were excluded. Trials investigating treatment strategies other than directly comparing intervention to medical therapy were excluded. This led to exclusion of three major trials namely: ORBITA 11 trial where the outcomes analyzed were angina relief, rather than hard end points, and follow up period was very short; DEFER trial 12 which looked at outcomes of safety in deferring intervention in patients where fractional flow reserve (FFR) value was > 0.75 (no conservative therapy alone arm) and 3 the trial by Hambrecht et al 13 which compared PCI with a 12 month exercise training program (no conservative therapy alone arm). There has been significant evolution in medical therapy for stable CAD. Pivotal trials looking at inhibitors of HMG‐CoA reductase (statins) from 1990's 14, 15 showed a significant improvement in mortality in patients with coronary artery disease. This has led to statins becoming the cornerstone of medical therapy in CAD. On the other hand, trials from 1990 to 2000's which looked at benefit of revascularization to medical therapy; had balloon angioplasty as the primary means of intervention. PCI with stents (preferably drug eluting over bare metal) is now standard practice for revascularization. Based on these significant paradigm shifts in therapies in both arms (revascularization and conservative), we excluded trials before 2000 as they did not reflect the current standard of care. This meta‐analysis was performed using PRISMA statement guidelines, 16 (Figure 1). Two investigators (A. V. K. K.) independently extracted outcomes into a data collection form. Disagreements were resolved by discussions between the two authors or via reaching a consensus by involving a third investigator (H. C.). The definitions of outcomes were accepted as provided in the studies. In cases of multiple follow up publications in a trial, the longest available follow up was accepted. Ethical/Institutional review board approval was not applicable to our study.

### Impact of percutaneous revascularization on exercise Hemodynamics in patients With Stable coronary disease [^116xHqEs]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

Clinical implications

These data demonstrate that PCI immediately normalizes the physiological response to exercise in coronary, microcirculatory, and systemic circulations. These beneficial adaptations were associated with a large improvement in patient symptoms and exercise tolerance; however, the patient was unblinded to the fact they had received PCI. Although this is analogous with everyday clinical practice (i.e. every patient is aware they have received a stent), the results of the recently reported ORBITA trial clearly indicate that there is also a placebo effect associated with undergoing PCI.

As clinicians, we should feel confident about the biological plausibility of PCI as an effective therapy for the relief of angina; however, we should also be aware that patients also gain some functional improvement from placebo. Therefore, we should take the opportunity of the PCI procedure to emphasize to the patient how effective the PCI has been, both anatomically and physiologically. Such steps are already commonly performed by some operators (for example, by showing the patient the pre- and post-PCI angiogram images as a demonstration of the anatomic success of the procedure). We speculate that in addition to enhancing overall patient education, simple steps such as these would maximize the overall therapeutic benefit of PCI in stable angina.

Study limitations

This study addressed only single-vessel disease and only cases with sufficiently focal lesions that there was good expectation of full resolution by stenting. Accordingly, this represents a highly selected group of patients. General clinical practice covers a much wider variety of disease anatomy. It is not known how multivessel disease or multivessel PCI might fair in such a study. The advantage of discrete single-vessel disease is that the anatomy and physiology have a good chance of being normalized by the PCI.

Our study only enrolled patients who would be able to exercise on a supine bicycle. This meant that more frail individuals were not eligible. It also meant that if the operator needed to carry out femoral access, the patient could not conduct the protocol. Furthermore, owing to the potential for (unmeasured) myocardial stunning or hibernation immediately post-PCI, the improvement in functional capacity demonstrated in our study may be an underestimation of the longer-term therapeutic effect.

### Current options in the management of coronary artery disease [^1131ki7M]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

World Health Organization projections suggest that, for the foreseeable future, coronary artery disease (CAD) will remain the largest element of global disease burden, reflecting the aging of the population. Recent American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines estimate that 16.6 million Americans currently have stable angina. Chronic stable angina is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, thus highlighting the need for accurate and early detection and treatment. Clinical examination is the single most important step in evaluating risk. Age, sex, pain type, coexisting diabetes mellitus, hypertension, or known vascular disease are powerful predictors of prognosis and, except for special patient groups, are more reliable than ambulatory electrocardiographic recording, exercise testing, or electron-beam computed tomography. Cost-effective methods for screening the general population for "silent" risk factors predisposing them to atherosclerotic disease in later life are nevertheless required. Aspirin, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and lipid-lowering agents are currently the backbone of pharmacologic therapy, supplemented by lifestyle changes aimed at promoting exercise, weight reduction, and increased fruit and vegetable intake. However, side effects of chronic drug treatment, especially for those taking multidrug regimens, may affect quality of life and are the principal reason for poor compliance. Coronary bypass surgery and angioplasty are frequently used interventional procedures for CAD, although they can be invasive and costly, and they often need to be repeated. Current options for the management of CAD have their limitations, thus confirming the appropriateness of continuing the search for improved therapies to reverse the disease process and reduce the global burden.

### Potent anti-ischaemic effects of statins in chronic stable angina: incremental benefit beyond lipid lowering? [^111wSVzC]. European Heart Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Aims

The DoUble-blind Atorvastatin AmLodipine (DUAAL) trial investigated whether atorvastatin decreases ischaemia by a vascular benefit, independent of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol lowering, in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), both alone and in combination with the traditional anti-anginal therapy, amlodipine.

Methods and Results

Randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, multicountry trial (2 weeks run-in and 24 weeks active therapy) comparing three treatments: amlodipine, atorvastatin, and amlodipine + atorvastatin; in 311 patients (78% male; mean age 62 years) with stable angina (≥ 2 attacks/week), CAD history, ≥ 3 transient myocardial ischaemia (TMI) episodes, and/or ≥ 15 min ischaemia on 48 h ambulatory electrocardiographic (AECG) monitoring. Efficacy variables were change in TMI by AECG, exercise ischaemia, angina diary data, and inflammatory biomarkers at Week 26. There was a comparable, highly significant decrease in TMI with amlodipine and atorvastatin, but no additional benefit for the combination. More than 50% of patients became TMI-free in all three groups and this was accompanied by a comparable, marked reduction in angina and nitroglycerin consumption. High-sensitivity C-reactive protein fell by 40% in patients receiving atorvastatin but there was no change with amlodipine. Adverse events were comparable among groups.

Conclusion

Atorvastatin was as potent an anti-ischaemic agent as amlodipine. Future studies of combination therapies will be instructive.

### Comparison between National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) and European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines for the diagnosis and management of stable angina: implications for clinical practice [^115zj8vf]. Open Heart (2016). Low credibility.

Diagnosis

Both NICE and the ESC recommend a clinical assessment which includes a history and physical examination. If the pain is non-anginal (one or no features of anginal pain), angina is excluded and other causes for the pain should be sought (table 2). If angina cannot be diagnosed or excluded based on the history (two or three features of anginal pain), then an ECG should be performed, and further diagnostic testing may be indicated depending on the pretest probability (PTP) of CAD. This is assessed from prevalence estimates of obstructive CAD based on age, gender and symptomatology (table 3, web addendum table 1). Both guidelines recommend against diagnostic testing in patients who have a very low or very high PTP of CAD due to the limited added value of testing in these groups.

Table 2
Clinical classification of chest pain used by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence and the European Society of Cardiology

Table 3
Prevalence estimates for coronary artery disease in patients with stable chest pain based on age, gender and symptoms, and their influence on diagnostic testing

In NICE's guidance, patients who remain in the diagnostic algorithm fall into three groups which undergo different diagnostic testing according to the PTP of CAD:
PTP 10–29% — CT calcium score with or without CT coronary angiography
PTP 30–60% — functional imaging
PTP 61–90% — invasive coronary angiography

NICE recommends against using the exercise ECG to diagnose or exclude stable angina for people without known CAD.

According to ESC guidance, if angina has not been excluded following clinical assessment, an echocardiogram should be performed. Patients who have both a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) < 50% and typical angina should be offered invasive coronary angiography. Other patients who have a PTP of 15–85% should undergo non-invasive testing for ischaemia or CT coronary angiography. Stress imaging is the preferred option, but exercise ECG testing is recommended for patients with a PTP of 15–65% where stress imaging is not locally available. The ESC recommends against using the exercise ECG as a diagnostic test in patients with a PTP > 65%. CT coronary angiography is recommended as an alternative to stress imaging in patients with a PTP 15–50%.

### Population need for coronary revascularisation: are national targets for england credible? [^115VYD7C]. Heart (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To estimate the need for coronary revascularisation, by using an incidence of indications approach, among 45–84 year olds with stable angina, unstable angina, and acute myocardial infarction.

Design

Modelling exercise. Six key steps along the pathway of care from initial diagnosis in primary or secondary care to revascularisation were defined and the frequency of indications estimated using routine data from hospital admissions and data from studies in the general population, and primary and secondary care.

Setting and Patients

Mid-1998 population of England.

Intervention

Coronary revascularisation.

Main Outcome Measure

Ability to benefit (need), defined by randomised trials, expert panel ratings from the ACRE (appropriateness of coronary revascularisation) study, or by informal consensus.

Results

The need for coronary revascularisation was estimated to be 92 000 procedures, equivalent to a rate of 1861 per million population. Overall, the model of need exceeded current provision by 3.3:1, although among people aged 75 years and over the ratio was 7.7:1. A plausible upper estimate of need — obtained by assuming that 90% of patients with stable angina were referred from primary care and that angiography would be performed in 65% of patients with acute myocardial infarction and 75% of patients with unstable angina — was 2626 per million population.

Conclusions

The national target of 1500 revascularisation procedures per million population is credibly related to population need, although upper estimates of need are considerably higher. Better understanding is required of the benefits of referring patients with specific indications from primary care. The greatest relative increase in provision is required for those aged 75 and older, among whom trial evidence of benefit is scant.

### Physical activity after percutaneous coronary intervention for chronic total occlusion and its association with health status [^113DjdD6]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Background Patients with chronic total occlusion (CTO) may not participate in regular exercise because of refractory angina. Exercise participation after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for CTO (CTO PCI) and the association of exercise with health status after CTO PCI is unknown. Methods and Results Overall, 1000 patients enrolled in the Outcomes, Patient Health Status, and Efficiency in Chronic Total Occlusion OPEN CTO is a registry were asked about participation in regular exercise at baseline and 12 months after CTO PCI, and the frequency of exercise (< 1, 1–2, ≥ 3 times/week) was collected among exercisers. Health status was assessed using the Seattle Angina Questionnaire (SAQ). Multivariable regression assessed 12-month health status change across 4 groups defined by exercise frequency at baseline and 12 months after CTO PCI (no regular exercise at baseline and 12 months, reduced, increased, and consistent exercise at 12 months). Among 869 patients with complete exercise data, the proportion that exercised regularly increased from 33.5% at baseline to 56.6% 12 months after CTO PCI (P < 0.01). Predictors of regular exercise at 12 months included baseline exercise, smoking, baseline and increase in SAQ scores for angina frequency, physical limitation, quality of life, and summary. After multivariable adjustment, consistent or increased exercise frequency was associated with significantly greater improvement in SAQ scores for angina frequency, physical limitation, quality of life, and summary (P < 0.01). Conclusions Participation in regular exercise increased significantly 12 months after CTO PCI, and patients who had greater health status benefit after PCI were more likely to exercise regularly at 12 months. CTO PCI may enable coronary artery disease patients with limiting symptoms to engage in regular exercise and to support better long-term outcomes.

### Mortality reduction with physical activity in patients with and without cardiovascular disease [^1176v42H]. European Heart Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Previous studies that showed the survival benefits of physical activity primarily focused on healthy individuals and did not distinguish between primary and secondary CVD prevention. Peak exercise capacity has been shown to be the strongest predictor of survival in subjects with pre-existing CVD. Strong evidence supports exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation in patients with coronary heart disease and exercise training in patients with chronic HF. However, recommendations on the level of physical activity for secondary prevention have been less clear. The European Society of Cardiology guidelines on stable coronary artery disease encourage moderate-to-vigorous intensity aerobic exercise training ≥ 3 times a week for 30 min per session. Meanwhile, the guideline for stable ischaemic heart disease from the American College of Cardiology Foundation and American Heart Association recommends 30–60 min of moderate-intensity aerobic activity at least 5 days and preferably 7 days per week. The latter one states that the recommended level of physical activity was in line with that for healthy adults. In addition, guidelines for other CVDs such as prior MI, prior stroke, and chronic HF lack specific recommendations. This reflects the paucity of data for this specific group of patients.

Exercise has been proven to have a variety of cardiovascular benefits. An increase in physical activity has been shown to have beneficial effects on plasma lipoproteins such as decreased LDL and increased HDL. A meta-analysis showed that resistance training reduces systolic blood pressure by 6.19 mmHg and glycosylated haemoglobin by 0.48%. Studies have also proven a reduced production of atherogenic cytokine and an increase in atheroprotective cytokines, depression in platelet aggregation and adhesiveness, lower inflammatory markers, and reduced arrhythmogenicity with exercise. Evidence also indicates that exercise has a favourable impact on cardiac remodelling and, thus, improvements in cardiac performance.

The present study provides a novel perspective into the preventive role of physical activity in patients with CVD. As shown in the present study, individuals with CVD tend to achieve a lower level of physical activity. Not only they are typically older with multiple comorbidities, but their cardiac condition also limits their physical capacity. However, clinicians should emphasize the importance of a physically active lifestyle for those patients. They should be encouraged to maintain as much physical activity as possible. They may even expect greater benefits compared to their counterparts without CVD while performing the same levels of physical activity. A level of 500 MET-min/week of physical activity should be considered the minimum requirement for patients with CVD. Although physical activity above 500–1000 MET-min/week would provide little advantage for healthy people without CVD, this would provide additive benefits for those with CVD.

### 2023 AHA / ACC / ACCP / ASPC / NLA / PCNA guideline for the management of patients with chronic coronary disease: a report of the American Heart Association / American college of cardiology joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^112o1gKf]. Circulation (2023). High credibility.

Synopsis of revascularization in stable chronic coronary disease — The management of patients with CCD and stable angina is 3-fold: relief of symptoms, prevention of nonfatal events such as MI, and improving long-term survival. Revascularization results in a greater improvement in angina and QOL than does medical therapy alone and, among appropriate patients with CCD, lowers the risk of cardiovascular death, MI, and urgent revascularization, but the effect of revascularization on improving survival in patients with CCD is more nuanced, with multiple studies and meta-analyses confirming an overall null effect on all-cause death for CCD, with few exceptions.

### Evaluation of primary care patients with chronic stable angina: guidelines from the American College of Physicians [^113nC7zv]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

In 1999, the American College of Physicians (ACP), then the American College of Physicians-American Society of Internal Medicine, and the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) developed joint guidelines on the management of patients with chronic stable angina. The ACC/AHA then published an updated guideline in 2002, which the ACP recognized as a scientifically valid review of the evidence and background paper. This ACP guideline summarizes the recommendations of the 2002 ACC/AHA updated guideline and underscores the recommendations most likely to be important to physicians seeing patients in the primary care setting. This guideline is the first of 2 that will provide guidance on the management of patients with chronic stable angina. This document will cover diagnosis and risk stratification for symptomatic patients who have not had an acute myocardial infarction or revascularization procedure in the previous 6 months. Sections addressing asymptomatic patients are also included. Asymptomatic refers to patients with known or suspected coronary disease based on history or on electrocardiographic evidence of previous myocardial infarction, coronary angiography, or abnormal results on noninvasive tests. A future guideline will cover pharmacologic therapy and follow-up.

### Role of ivabradine in management of stable angina in patients with different clinical profiles [^117DLX8j]. Open Heart (2018). Low credibility.

Ivabradine in combination therapy in angina

Additional anti-ischaemic benefits have been observed with ivabradine in patients who were already receiving standard therapy with beta-blockers. Evaluation of the Antianginal efficacy and Safety of the aSsociation Of the I f Current Inhibitor ivAbradine with a beTa-blockEr (ASSOCIATE) — a double-blind, randomised, multicentre, placebo-controlled trial — study enrolled 889 patients with stable anginaand a positive exercise stress test despite treatment with atenolol 50 mg once daily. ASSOCIATE study randomised patients to receive placebo (n = 440) or ivabradine (n = 449) 5 mg twice daily for 2 months, which was then increased to 7.5 mg twice daily for two further months. Patients underwent exercise testing at 2 months and 4 months of follow-up. In the ivabradine group, heart rate decreased by 7 bpm during the first 2 months of treatment with 5 mg twice daily and by 9 bpm with ivabradine 7.5 mg twice daily. Patients in the ivabradine group showed a significant increase in total exercise time and all other exercise test criteria such as time to limiting angina, time to angina onset and time to 1 mm ST-segment depression (P < 0.001) compared with patients receiving placebo (figure 2). This improvement was dose dependent with greater beneficial effects observed in patients receiving 7.5 mg twice daily compared with those on 5 mg twice daily. Ivabradine was well tolerated, and 90% of patients were uptitrated to 7.5 mg twice daily after the first 2 months. This study demonstrated that in patients with stable angina receiving anti-ischaemic therapy with the beta-blocker atenolol the addition of ivabradine resulted in a significant long-term improvement in exercise induced myocardial ischaemia.

### Angina: contemporary diagnosis and management [^116T6SP5]. Heart (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The optimal management of patients with known or suspected angina begins with establishing the correct diagnosis. Around one half of angina patients have no obstructive coronary disease; many of these patients have microvascular and/or vasospastic angina. Non-invasive assessment with CTCA is a sensitive anatomical test for plaque which assists in initial treatment and risk stratification. Anatomical imaging has fundamental limitations to rule in or rule out coronary vasomotion disorders in patients with symptoms and/or signs of ischaemia but no obstructive CAD (INOCA). Women are disproportionately represented in this group with MVA and/or VSA, the two most common causes of diagnoses. A personalised approach to invasive diagnostic testing permits a diagnosis to be made (or excluded) during the patients' index presentation. This approach helps stratify medical therapy leading to improved patient health and quality of life. Physician appraisal of ischaemic heart disease (IHD) should consider all pathophysiology relevant to symptoms, prognosis and treatment to improve health outcomes for our patients. More research is warranted, particularly to develop disease modifying therapy.

### Metoprolol tartrate [^1116W9PH]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

1.1 Hypertension

Metoprolol tartrate is indicated for the treatment of hypertension in adult patients, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure lowers the risk of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes including metoprolol.

Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than 1 drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program's Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC).

Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly.

Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal.

Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy.

Metoprolol tartrate may be administered with other antihypertensive agents.

1.2 Angina Pectoris

Metoprolol tartrate is indicated in the long-term treatment of angina pectoris, to reduce angina attacks and to improve exercise tolerance.

1.3 Myocardial Infarction

Metoprolol tartrate tablets are indicated in the treatment of hemodynamically stable patients with definite or suspected acute myocardial infarction to reduce cardiovascular mortality when used alone or in conjunction with intravenous metoprolol.

### Clinical trials update from the European Society of Cardiology: SENIORS, ACES, PROVE-IT, ACTION, and the HF-ACTION trial [^115iDirK]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2004). Low credibility.

This article provides information and a commentary on landmark trials presented at the European Society of Cardiology Congress in August 2004, relevant to the pathophysiology, prevention or treatment of heart failure. The SENIORS trial suggests that nebivolol is well tolerated and effective in older patients with heart failure, even if left ventricular systolic function is not markedly depressed. However, patients aged > 75 years appeared to gain less benefit. Further data on the effects of nebivolol on symptoms and quality of life are awaited. Two new trials of long-term antibiotic prophylaxis after myocardial infarction (ACES and PROVE-IT) showed no benefit. The ACTION trial showed no reduction in serious cardiovascular events with nifedipine GITS in patients with chronic stable angina, despite a substantial reduction in blood pressure. The HF-ACTION trial announced that the first 700 patients of a projected 3000 had been randomised to either an exercise program or encouragement to exercise but without a formal program. The primary outcome measure is death or hospitalisation for any reason.

### Haemostasis and fibrinolysis after regular high-intensity interval training in patients with coronary artery disease: a randomised controlled trial [^112pUFQE]. Open Heart (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) have prothrombotic changes compared with healthy individuals. Regular exercise reduces cardiovascular mortality in patients with stable CAD. However, the underlying mechanism for the beneficial effect is unknown. We investigated whether regular exercise would inhibit platelet aggregation and thrombin generation and increase fibrinolysis in patients with CAD.

Materials and methods

Patients with CAD were randomised 1:1 to a supervised high-intensity exercise training programme or standard care for 12 weeks. Blood samples were obtained at baseline and after 6 and 12 weeks. Platelet aggregation was evaluated with the Multiplate Analyser, thrombin generation using the calibrated automated thrombogram and fibrinolysis employing a clot lysis assay.

Results

A total of 169 stable patients with CAD were randomised, and 142 patients (67 ± 9 years, 83% males) completed the study; 64 in the exercise group and 78 in the standard care group. All but one patients received single antiplatelet therapy. From baseline to 12 weeks postintervention (Δ), no significant between-group differences were found in adenosine diphosphate-induced platelet aggregation (Δ−15 aggregation units (AU), AU×min, 95% CI −70 to 40 in the exercise group and Δ−26 AU×min, 95% CI −77 to 26 in the standard care group, p = 0.44); endogenous thrombin potential (medians: Δ−5%, 95% CI −12 to 3 in the exercise group and Δ−6%, 95% CI −13 to 1 in the standard care group, p = 0.26); nor in 50% clot lysis time (medians: Δ−9%, 95% CI −23 to 7 in the exercise group and Δ−17%, 95% CI −29 to −3 in the standard care group, p = 0.60).

Conclusions

Twelve weeks of high-intensity whole-body endurance exercise did not affect platelet aggregation, thrombin generation or fibrinolysis in patients with stable CAD.

### Physical activity in the prevention and treatment of coronary artery disease [^1164wnUc]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Exercise Prescription

International guidelines, such as the European guidelines on cardiovascular disease prevention in clinical practice (published in 2016), clearly recommend regular exercise training as a cornerstone of CAD prevention and treatment. 113 In general, > 150 minutes of endurance exercise training per week at moderate to vigorous intensity, with a total energy expenditure of 1000 to 2000 kcal or > 75 minutes at vigorous intensity, ideally spread over 3 to 5 days, is recommended. Exercise training should be started at a low(er) intensity and gradually increased over time. Endurance exercise should be complemented by resistance exercise training 2 times per week at moderate intensity. 113 With evidence in mind that cardiorespiratory fitness is a better predictor of mortality than physical activity, it was thought that a certain amount of exercise is necessary to increase fitness and thereby achieve any beneficial health effect, with exercise intensity having higher importance than duration. 23, 24 However, the recommended thresholds of minimum physical activity cannot be reached by many subjects with mobility limitations. Frith and Loprinzi demonstrated that the duration of light‐intensity physical activity in these patients is still inversely associated with all‐cause mortality, with a reduction of 14% for every 60 minutes of activity per day. 114 Warburton and Bredin 14 recently demonstrated, in an outstanding review of 16 systematic reviews and/or meta‐analyses, that the relationship between physical activity and health benefits is curvilinear, with the greatest benefits at minor volumes of physical activity and attenuation at high volumes of physical activity. They did not find evidence for a certain threshold of physical activity for the occurrence of any health benefit. The authors noted that the threshold‐based messaging that is used in many guidelines, with a recommendation of > 150 minutes of physical activity, is not based on evidence and might even represent a barrier to healthy living for people who do not attempt to reach this threshold. However, these people are the ones who particularly stand to benefit greatly from routine physical activity when moving from an inactive to a more active state. Notwithstanding, this review again supports the finding of greater health benefits with higher physical activity volume and fitness level.

### Achieving optimal medical therapy: insights from the ORBITA trial [^115cwf4L]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

The treatment aims for patients with stable coronary artery disease (CAD) are to reduce the risk of future cardiovascular events and to improve angina symptoms. 1 Reducing the risk of future cardiovascular events is achieved by slowing disease progression, reducing plaque instability, and reducing thrombus aggregation. This is achieved with lifestyle modification, high‐intensity statin therapy, and antiplatelets. 2 Large randomized controlled trials in stable CAD have demonstrated that percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) does not confer a survival benefit or a reduced risk of myocardial infarction, when added to optimal medical therapy. 3, 4 In the ISCHEMIA (International Study of Comparative Health Effectiveness With Medical and Invasive Approaches) trial, even in the context of moderate or severe ischemia, PCI did not prevent myocardial infarction or death. 5

The second aim of treatment is symptom relief. National and international guidelines recommend initial use of antianginal medications, which can be used in combination to reduce symptoms. If a patient's angina is not well controlled with the use of short‐acting nitrates alone, recommended first‐line therapy is either a β blocker or a calcium channel antagonist. Second‐ and third‐line agents, including long‐acting nitrates, nicorandil, ivabradine, and ranolazine, should be chosen according to comorbidities, contraindications, patient preference, and medication cost. Revascularization is considered for patients who remain symptomatic despite treatment with at least 2 antianginal agents or are intolerant of medical therapy. 6, 7

### A placebo-controlled trial of percutaneous coronary intervention for stable angina [^112ETcgA]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

Follow-Up

On the day of randomization, all antianginal medications initiated in the pre-randomization period were stopped. Patients entered the 12-week blinded follow-up phase, with continued daily smartphone application symptom reporting. During this period, antianginal medication initiation and uptitration was triggered by patient contact and managed by staff blinded to study group allocation, using an identical protocol to the pre-randomization phase.

At the end of the blinded follow-up period, patients returned for exercise stress test, dobutamine stress echo and symptom and quality of life questionnaires. After test completion, patients and research and medical teams were unblinded. This marked the end of the study. Patients returned to usual clinical care. Any actions or decisions after unblinding did not contribute to study end point data.

End Points

The primary end point is the angina symptom score: an ordinal clinical outcome scale calculated daily from the number of angina episodes and the units of antianginal medication (Tables S3 and S4). More angina episodes and antianginal medication use led to a higher score. A patient with no angina and no antianginals scored zero. This ordinal scale also incorporated high-level category overrides of unblinding for intolerable angina (requiring unscheduled coronary angiography), acute coronary syndrome (unstable angina or myocardial infarction meeting the fourth universal definition) or death(Table S4).

Secondary end points included self-reported angina frequency (smartphone application); antianginal medication initiation and uptitration; treadmill exercise time increment; physician-assessed angina severity (Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS) class); angina frequency, physical limitation, angina stability, freedom from angina (SAQ); quality of life (SAQ and EQ-5D-5L); and stress echocardiography score.

Recommendation-specific supportive text notes that ACC/AHA clinical practice guidelines for stable CAD recommend optimization of anti-ischemic and preventive therapies to reduce angina burden and improve outcomes, and that for all patients with a history of CAD risk factors, optimized preventive therapy should be used according to ACC/AHA clinical practice guidelines.

### Antianginal and antiischemic effects of ivabradine, an I (f) inhibitor, in stable angina: a randomized, double-blind, multicentered, placebo-controlled trial [^112ZUpNQ]. Circulation (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Heart rate reduction should benefit patients with chronic stable angina by improving myocardial perfusion and reducing myocardial oxygen demand. This study evaluated the antianginal and antiischemic effects of ivabradine, a new heart rate-lowering agent that acts specifically on the sinoatrial node.

Methods and Results

In a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 360 patients with a ≥ 3-month history of chronic stable angina were randomly assigned to receive ivabradine (2.5, 5, or 10 mg BID) or placebo for 2 weeks, followed by an open-label 2- or 3-month extension on ivabradine (10 mg BID) and a 1-week randomized withdrawal to ivabradine (10 mg BID) or placebo. Primary efficacy criteria were changes in time to 1-mm ST-segment depression and time to limiting angina during bicycle exercise (exercise tolerance tests), performed at trough of drug activity. In the per-protocol population (n = 257), time to 1-mm ST-segment depression increased in the 5 and 10 mg BID groups (P < 0.005); time to limiting angina increased in the 10 mg BID group (P < 0.05). Deterioration in all exercise tolerance test parameters occurred in patients who received placebo during randomized withdrawal (all P < 0.02) but not in those still receiving ivabradine. No rebound phenomena were observed on treatment cessation.

Conclusions

Ivabradine produces dose-dependent improvements in exercise tolerance and time to development of ischemia during exercise. These results suggest that ivabradine, representing a novel class of antianginal drugs, is effective and safe during 3 months of use; longer-term safety requires additional assessment.

### Home-based versus centre-based cardiac rehabilitation: abridged cochrane systematic review and meta-analysis [^111496QG]. Open Heart (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Home-based and hospital-based or centre-based CR have similar benefits in terms of clinical events, risk factors and HRQoL outcomes in patients after MI or coronary revascularisation and in those with heart failure. Together with the absence of evidence of differences in healthcare costs, and given the current suboptimal uptake of CR services, these findings strongly support the further roll-out of home-based CR programmes, thus offering patients improved access and choice.

Future research should focus on the long-term effects of home-based versus centre-based CR, and well-reported adequately powered head-to-head randomised studies are needed in patient groups poorly represented in this review, including angina pectoris.

### Clinical benefits of a metabolic approach with trimetazidine in revascularized patients with angina [^111UdXHc]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2006). Low credibility.

As patients with coronary artery disease live longer and more often reach the stage where further myocardial revascularization procedures can no longer be performed, efficacious and well-tolerated antianginal medications are needed. Metabolic agents offer the advantage of controlling symptoms without untoward hemodynamic effects. This article reviews the epidemiology of stable angina and the use of antianginal medications in patients who have undergone myocardial revascularization. It also describes the clinical data on the anti-ischemic effects of metabolic agents in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery or angioplasty, the latter in the setting of acute myocardial infarction and elective procedures. Lastly, the effects of trimetazidine on exercise tests in previously revascularized patients treated with beta-blockers, such as documented in the subgroup analysis of the Second Trimetazidine in Poland (TRIMPOL II) trial, are reported. In all, metabolic agents are likely to be beneficial in revascularized patients, with a documented anti-ischemic effect during myocardial revascularization procedures and the ability to improve exercise tolerance and symptoms in patients with chronic stable angina, despite myocardial revascularization.

### Haemostasis and fibrinolysis after regular high-intensity interval training in patients with coronary artery disease: a randomised controlled trial [^1169bSFN]. Open Heart (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Coronary artery disease (CAD) is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Guidelines recommend that patients with CAD are offered cardiac rehabilitation with a strong focus on exercise. Regular exercise reduces cardiovascular death and hospital admissions and improves quality of life in patients with CAD, but the underlying mechanisms have not been defined.

In atherosclerosis, the arterial endothelium is procoagulant and thus adhesive to platelets. Endothelial disruption or rupture of an atherosclerotic plaque leads to a haemostatic chain reaction with activated platelets and coagulation, which may result in coronary thrombus formation and acute myocardial infarction. Several studies on patients with CAD engaging in regular exercise have shown a significant reduction in platelet aggregation, coagulationand an increase in fibrinolysiscompared with baseline. In contrast, a recent randomised study showed that one year of exercise training failed to affect markers of procoagulant activity in patients with CAD and type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Only few studies have examined the impact of regular exercise on haemostasis in patients with stable CAD, and the results are diverging. Therefore, the aim of this randomised controlled study was to investigate whether regular supervised high-intensity exercise training affects haemostasis and fibrinolysis in patients with stable CAD. We hypothesised that compared with standard care, regular exercise training would reduce coagulation and platelet aggregation and increase fibrinolysis in patients with CAD.

### Exercise-based rehabilitation for coronary heart disease [^114rxMLp]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

Background

The burden of cardiovascular disease world-wide is one of great concern to patients and health care agencies alike. Cardiac rehabilitation aims to restore patients with heart disease to health through exercise only based rehabilitation or comprehensive cardiac rehabilitation.

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness of exercise only or exercise as part of a comprehensive cardiac rehabilitation programme on the mortality, morbidity, health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and modifiable cardiac risk factors of patients with coronary heart disease.

Search Strategy

Electronic databases were searched for randomised controlled trials, using standardised trial filters, from the earliest date available to December 31st 1998.

Selection Criteria

Men and women of all ages, in hospital or community settings, who have had myocardial infarction, coronary artery bypass graft or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, or who have angina pectoris or coronary artery disease defined by angiography.

Data Collection and Analysis

Studies were selected independently by two reviewers, and data extracted independently. Authors were contacted where possible to obtain missing information.

Main Results

This systematic review has allowed analysis of an increased number of patients from approximately 4500 in earlier meta-analyses to 8440 (7683 contributing to the total mortality outcome). The pooled effect estimate for total mortality for the exercise only intervention shows a 27% reduction in all cause mortality (random effects model OR 0.73 (0.54, 0.98)). Comprehensive cardiac rehabilitation reduced all cause mortality, but to a lesser degree (OR 0.87 (0.71, 1.05)). Total cardiac mortality was reduced by 31% (random effects model OR 0.69 (0.51, 0.94)) and 26% (random effects model OR 0.74 (0.57, 0.96)) in the exercise only and comprehensive cardiac rehabilitation groups respectively. Neither intervention had any effect on the occurrence of non-fatal myocardial infarction. There was a significant net reduction in total cholesterol (pooled WMD random effects model -0.57 mmol/l (-0.83, -0.31)) and LDL (pooled WMD random effects model -0.51 mmol/l (-0.82, -0.19) in the comprehensive cardiac rehabilitation group.

Reviewer's Conclusions

Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation is effective in reducing cardiac deaths. It is not clear from this review whether exercise only or a comprehensive cardiac rehabilitation intervention is more beneficial. The population studied in this review is still predominantly male, middle aged and low risk. Identification of the ethnic origin of the participants was seldom reported. It is possible that patients who would have benefited most from the intervention were excluded from the trials on the grounds of age, sex or co-morbidity.

### Impact of percutaneous revascularization on exercise Hemodynamics in patients With Stable coronary disease [^111wxz6i]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

In patients with stable coronary artery disease (SCD), the primary treatment goal of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is the relief of angina and improvement in functional capacity. However, the first double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of PCI for stable angina, the ORBITA trial (Objective Randomised Blinded Investigation With Optimal Medical Therapy of Angioplasty in Stable Angina), found a far smaller effect on exercise tolerance and symptoms than found in unblinded research, and in everyday clinical practice. This finding has refocused attention on the need to comprehensively define the therapeutic mechanisms of PCI in SCD.

Cardiac catheter laboratory protocols have recently been described that enable invasive measurements of coronary and systemic hemodynamics to be performed during supine exercise. Application of these protocols have yielded important mechanistic insight into a variety of anginal conditions. These include the physiological mechanisms underlying the warm-up angina phenomenon, the mechanisms of angina in severe aortic stenosis, and the alleviation of angina on exertion by sublingual nitroglycerin.

In this study, we exercised patients on the coronary catheter laboratory table during cardiac catheterization, immediately before and after PCI. Our hypothesis was that in patients with stable angina and hemodynamically significant single-vessel disease, PCI would immediately improve objectively documented exercise responses in the coronary circulation, the microcirculation, and systemic hemodynamics.

### Management of angina pectoris [^115xrem7]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Angina pectoris, a primary manifestation of ischemic heart disease, imposes a significant clinical and economic burden globally. This review highlights recent advancements in the management of angina, emphasizing a patient-centred approach that integrates pharmacological, interventional, and lifestyle strategies to reduce cardiovascular risk and improve patient outcomes. For obstructive coronary artery disease, optimal medical therapy represents the cornerstone of treatment. Individualized regimens should be tailored to clinical factors such as blood pressure, heart rate, left ventricular function, comorbidities like heart failure and diabetes, concomitant medications, patient preferences, and drug availability. Myocardial revascularization is reserved for select cases to alleviate symptoms or improve prognosis. For angina or ischemia with non-obstructive coronary arteries (ANOCA/INOCA), precise endotype classification, differentiating microvascular angina, vasospastic angina, mixed type and non-coronary chest pain, enables personalized treatment strategies. Lifestyle interventions, including smoking cessation, weight management, adherence to Mediterranean diet, and exercise therapy, are essential components of care, promoting improved cardiovascular outcomes and quality of life. Structured exercise programs, particularly within cardiac rehabilitation settings, have demonstrated efficacy in enhancing functional capacity and reducing adverse events. Emerging therapies, including pharmacological agents and novel interventional approaches such as the coronary sinus reducer, hold promise for addressing unmet needs in refractory angina and challenging ANOCA/INOCA cases. Future directions should prioritize the integration of precision medicine, digital health technologies, and multidisciplinary care to optimize outcomes and advance personalized angina management.

### Haemostasis and fibrinolysis after regular high-intensity interval training in patients with coronary artery disease: a randomised controlled trial [^1175QaDu]. Open Heart (2022). Medium credibility.

IntroductionPatients with coronary artery disease (CAD) have prothrombotic changes compared with healthy individuals. Regular exercise reduces cardiovascular mortality in patients with stable CAD. However, the underlying mechanism for the beneficial effect is unknown. We investigated whether regular exercise would inhibit platelet aggregation and thrombin generation and increase fibrinolysis in patients with CAD.

Materials and Methods

Patients with CAD were randomised 1:1 to a supervised high-intensity exercise training programme or standard care for 12 weeks. Blood samples were obtained at baseline and after 6 and 12 weeks. Platelet aggregation was evaluated with the Multiplate Analyser, thrombin generation using the calibrated automated thrombogram and fibrinolysis employing a clot lysis assay.

Results

A total of 169 stable patients with CAD were randomised, and 142 patients (67 ± 9 years, 83% males) completed the study; 64 in the exercise group and 78 in the standard care group. All but one patients received single antiplatelet therapy. From baseline to 12 weeks postintervention (Δ), no significant between-group differences were found in adenosine diphosphate-induced platelet aggregation (Δ-15 aggregation units (AU), AU×min, 95% CI -70 to 40 in the exercise group and Δ-26 AU×min, 95%CI -77 to 26 in the standard care group, p = 0.44); endogenous thrombin potential (medians: Δ-5%, 95%CI -12 to 3 in the exercise group and Δ-6%, 95%CI -13 to 1 in the standard care group, p = 0.26); nor in 50% clot lysis time (medians: Δ-9%, 95%CI -23 to 7 in the exercise group and Δ-17%, 95%CI -29 to -3 in the standard care group, p = 0.60).

Conclusions

Twelve weeks of high-intensity whole-body endurance exercise did not affect platelet aggregation, thrombin generation or fibrinolysis in patients with stable CAD.

### Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation for coronary heart disease: a meta-analysis [^1145yq6Y]. European Heart Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Aims

Coronary heart disease is the most common reason for referral to exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation (CR) globally. However, the generalizability of previous meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) is questioned. Therefore, a contemporary updated meta-analysis was undertaken.

Methods and results

Database and trial registry searches were conducted to September 2020, seeking RCTs of exercise-based interventions with ≥ 6-month follow-up, compared with no-exercise control for adults with myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, or following coronary artery bypass graft, or percutaneous coronary intervention. The outcomes of mortality, recurrent clinical events, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) were pooled using random-effects meta-analysis, and cost-effectiveness data were narratively synthesized. Meta-regression was used to examine effect modification. Study quality was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. A total of 85 RCTs involving 23 430 participants with a median 12-month follow-up were included. Overall, exercise-based CR was associated with significant risk reductions in cardiovascular mortality [risk ratio (RR): 0.74, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.64–0.86, number needed to treat (NNT): 37], hospitalizations (RR: 0.77, 95% CI: 0.67–0.89, NNT: 37), and myocardial infarction (RR: 0.82, 95% CI: 0.70–0.96, NNT: 100). There was some evidence of significantly improved HRQoL with CR participation, and CR is cost-effective. There was no significant impact on overall mortality (RR: 0.96, 95% CI: 0.89–1.04), coronary artery bypass graft (RR: 0.96, 95% CI: 0.80–1.15), or percutaneous coronary intervention (RR: 0.84, 95% CI: 0.69–1.02). No significant difference in effects was found across different patient groups, CR delivery models, doses, follow-up, or risk of bias.

Conclusion

This review confirms that participation in exercise-based CR by patients with coronary heart disease receiving contemporary medical management reduces cardiovascular mortality, recurrent cardiac events, and hospitalizations and provides additional evidence supporting the improvement in HRQoL and the cost-effectiveness of CR.

### The burden of angina pectoris and its complications [^111JQUfz]. Clinical Cardiology (2007). Low credibility.

Between 10 to 30% of patients with coronary disease still suffer from symptoms of angina pectoris in contemporary clinical practice. This article summarizes analytic tools for measuring angina, as well as, its prevalence based on community based surveys, registries and in randomized controlled trials. Additionally, the impact of angina symptoms on patients' survival rates, functional status, quality of life and health-related costs is reviewed. The effectiveness of treatment, revascularization and medical therapies, on reducing angina symptoms is also reviewed.

### Efficacy and safety of fasudil in patients with stable angina: a double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial [^112dbmwB]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

Objectives

This study sought to evaluate the efficacy and safety of fasudil, an orally available rho kinase inhibitor, in patients with stable angina.

Background

Several small, non-placebo-controlled trials suggest that fasudil reduces myocardial ischemia in patients with stable or vasospastic angina.

Methods

In a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial, the efficacy and safety of fasudil were evaluated in stable angina patients. Of the 206 patients screened, 84 patients with reproducible exercise times were randomized 1:1 to fasudil or placebo. Nitroglycerin as needed and a beta- or calcium-channel blocker were allowed. Fasudil or matching placebo was force-titrated from 20 mg three times daily to 80 mg twice daily with 20 mg twice-daily increments every two weeks. Symptom-limited exercise testing was performed after two, four, six, and eight weeks of treatment.

Results

At peak, exercise duration was significantly improved at all visits in both groups, although exercise duration was numerically greater in patients receiving fasudil versus those receiving placebo. Time to ≥ 1 mm ST-segment depression was increased with fasudil at both peak and trough compared with placebo (172.1 s vs. 44.0 s, p = 0.001, and 92.8 s vs. 26.4 s, p = 0.02, respectively). Fasudil improved Seattle Angina Questionnaire scores. No significant differences in Canadian Cardiovascular Society class, time to angina, or frequency of angina or nitroglycerin use were noted between groups. Fasudil did not affect heart rate or blood pressure, and was well tolerated.

Conclusions

Fasudil up to 80 mg three times daily significantly increased the ischemic threshold of angina patients during exercise with a trend toward increased exercise duration. Further investigation of fasudil doses > 80 mg three times daily is indicated.

### Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation for coronary heart disease [^1172Egg2]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

The burden of coronary heart disease (CHD) worldwide is one of great concern to patients and healthcare agencies alike. Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation aims to restore patients with heart disease to health.

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness of exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation (exercise training alone or in combination with psychosocial or educational interventions) on mortality, morbidity and health-related quality of life of patients with CHD.

Search Strategy

RCTs have been identified by searching CENTRAL, HTA, and DARE (using The Cochrane Library Issue 4, 2009), as well as MEDLINE (1950 to December 2009), EMBASE (1980 to December 2009), CINAHL (1982 to December 2009), and Science Citation Index Expanded (1900 to December 2009).

Selection Criteria

Men and women of all ages who have had myocardial infarction (MI), coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA), or who have angina pectoris or coronary artery disease defined by angiography.

Data Collection and Analysis

Studies were selected and data extracted independently by two reviewers. Authors were contacted where possible to obtain missing information.

Main Results

This systematic review has allowed analysis of 47 studies randomising 10,794 patients to exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation or usual care. In medium to longer term (i.e. 12 or more months follow-up) exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation reduced overall and cardiovascular mortality [RR 0.87 (95% CI 0.75, 0.99) and 0.74 (95% CI 0.63, 0.87), respectively], and hospital admissions [RR 0.69 (95% CI 0.51, 0.93)] in the shorter term (< 12 months follow-up) with no evidence of heterogeneity of effect across trials. Cardiac rehabilitation did not reduce the risk of total MI, CABG or PTCA. Given both the heterogeneity in outcome measures and methods of reporting findings, a meta-analysis was not undertaken for health-related quality of life. In seven out of 10 trials reporting health-related quality of life using validated measures was there evidence of a significantly higher level of quality of life with exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation than usual care.

Authors' Conclusions

Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation is effective in reducing total and cardiovascular mortality (in medium to longer term studies) and hospital admissions (in shorter term studies) but not total MI or revascularisation (CABG or PTCA). Despite inclusion of more recent trials, the population studied in this review is still predominantly male, middle aged and low risk. Therefore, well-designed, and adequately reported RCTs in groups of CHD patients more representative of usual clinical practice are still needed. These trials should include validated health-related quality of life outcome measures, need to explicitly report clinical events including hospital admission, and assess costs and cost-effectiveness.

Recommendation-specific supportive text — drug selection and combination strategies emphasizes that beta blockers have been considered the first antianginal to use in patients with symptomatic CCD, although the evidence basis for this prioritization is not strong. Early randomized, placebo-controlled studies found that beta blockers increased the percentage of patients free of exertional angina, reduced anginal attacks and reduced nitroglycerin consumption. A meta-analysis of 72 studies comparing beta blockers with CCBs found fewer episodes of angina per week with beta blockers and lower rates of drug discontinuation, with no difference observed in the rate of death or MI between the 2 drug classes and no difference in the primary endpoint of exercise duration in a more recent meta-analysis. In randomized, placebo-controlled trials, CCBs effectively relieve angina, decrease nitroglycerin consumption, and increase exercise duration, and long-acting nitrates decrease angina and improve exercise duration. Non-dihydropyridine CCBs (verapamil and diltiazem) can further depress LV function and should not be used in patients with CCD and significant LV dysfunction; in patients with CCD and angina refractory to 1 agent, a combination with another antianginal agent improves symptom control, and non-dihydropyridine CCBs should be used with caution in patients on beta blockers because of the potential for synergistic induction or exacerbation of bradycardia and LV dysfunction; the addition of a long-acting nitrate to a beta blocker or a CCB improves exercise tolerance, reduces angina frequency and short-acting nitrate use. Control of symptoms may be achieved by most patients, but full freedom from angina is only achieved in 40% to 50%, depending on anginal frequency at the onset of treatment.

Risk factor management and cardiac rehabilitation

Patients across the spectrum of refractory angina have multiple modifiable adverse cardiovascular risk factors. For those with established epicardial CAD, guidelines define specific treatment targets to modify risk factors, which are associated with improved major adverse cardiovascular events. Patients with CMD and vasospasm frequently have early atheromatous change in their coronary arteries. Furthermore, CMD and vasospasm can co-exist with established CAD. Therefore, while not formally supported by outcomes data, it would seem biologically plausible to treat cardiovascular risk factors in refractory angina patients to the targets established in guidelines for epicardial CAD. Treatment with ACEi/ARBs may reduce major adverse cardiovascular events in patients with epicardial vasospasm. The prognostic benefit of intensive cardiovascular risk factor modification and anti-platelet therapy in ANOCA/INOCA remains under investigation. Implementation of systematic risk factor modification to attain guideline-directed targets in patients with refractory angina remains suboptimal. This may be improved by enrolment into formal CR programs that include optimization of cardiovascular risk factor control as a fundamental component.

Patients with refractory angina should also be considered for lifestyle interventions, in particular, smoking cessation which remains not only a leading cause of atherosclerosis worldwide but is also associated with vasospasm and CMD. A program of weight loss, low energy diet, and risk factor modification may improve angina control and microvascular function.

A major barrier to CR is concern regarding its safety in patients with refractory angina. In those with obstructive CAD, exercise rehabilitation can be successfully delivered and improves physical ability. A meta-analysis has confirmed that CR reduces mortality, hospitalization, and improves quality of life in patients with CAD. Initial work suggests improvements in exercise capacity, quality of life, symptom burden, and ischaemia in ANOCA/INOCA. Recent consensus documents suggest beneficial effects of CR for patients with microvascular angina. Physical performance improves after CR in vasospasm. With increasing evidence of the wide-ranging benefits of CR across the spectrum of patients comprising the refractory angina population, future guidelines will place a greater emphasis on its role.

### Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation for coronary heart disease: a meta-analysis [^1162CPL3]. European Heart Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Aims

Coronary heart disease is the most common reason for referral to exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation (CR) globally. However, the generalizability of previous meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) is questioned. Therefore, a contemporary updated meta-analysis was undertaken.

Methods and Results

Database and trial registry searches were conducted to September 2020, seeking RCTs of exercise-based interventions with ≥ 6-month follow-up, compared with no-exercise control for adults with myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, or following coronary artery bypass graft, or percutaneous coronary intervention. The outcomes of mortality, recurrent clinical events, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) were pooled using random-effects meta-analysis, and cost-effectiveness data were narratively synthesized. Meta-regression was used to examine effect modification. Study quality was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. A total of 85 RCTs involving 23 430 participants with a median 12-month follow-up were included. Overall, exercise-based CR was associated with significant risk reductions in cardiovascular mortality [risk ratio (RR): 0.74, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.64–0.86, number needed to treat (NNT): 37], hospitalizations (RR: 0.77, 95% CI: 0.67–0.89, NNT: 37), and myocardial infarction (RR: 0.82, 95% CI: 0.70–0.96, NNT: 100). There was some evidence of significantly improved HRQoL with CR participation, and CR is cost-effective. There was no significant impact on overall mortality (RR: 0.96, 95% CI: 0.89–1.04), coronary artery bypass graft (RR: 0.96, 95% CI: 0.80–1.15), or percutaneous coronary intervention (RR: 0.84, 95% CI: 0.69–1.02). No significant difference in effects was found across different patient groups, CR delivery models, doses, follow-up, or risk of bias.

Conclusion

This review confirms that participation in exercise-based CR by patients with coronary heart disease receiving contemporary medical management reduces cardiovascular mortality, recurrent cardiac events, and hospitalizations and provides additional evidence supporting the improvement in HRQoL and the cost-effectiveness of CR.

Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) after ACS — patients "should be referred to CR during hospitalization for ACS and prior to discharge". Exercise-based CR benefits include that "Exercise-based CR programs are associated with improved survival and reduced risk of reinfarction in patients after AMI", and "Patients with ACS who participate in CR have significantly better outcomes compared with those who do not". Evidence cited notes, "In a meta-analysis of 85 RCTs of exercise-based CR in patients with coronary heart disease, the intervention reduced risk of MI, reduced all-cause hospitalization, reduced health care costs, and improved health-related QOL outcomes over 12 months of follow-up", and "Longer follow-up suggested reductions in cardiovascular mortality". Older adults are highlighted: "CR is particularly beneficial in older patients with CAD, a group that is at a higher risk of losing independence and functioning". For access and models of delivery, "To improve access for patients who live in rural locations and in areas with no center-based CR, home-based CR options should be considered", and "A review of 23 RCTs of home- and center-based CR found that these programs tend to implement the same core components", with "a similar improvement in QOL and no statistically significant difference in the all-cause mortality rate up to 12 months after the intervention". The page adds that "Hybrid models that combine elements of both center- and home-based programs may also offer benefits".

### Efficacy of the I (f) current inhibitor ivabradine in patients with chronic stable angina receiving β-blocker therapy: a 4-month, randomized, placebo-controlled trial [^114eteL7]. European Heart Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Introduction

Angina pectoris is typically caused by myocardial ischaemia owing to an imbalance between myocardial perfusion and oxygen demand. Elevated heart rate increases myocardial oxygen demand and limits tissue perfusion, the latter by reducing the duration of diastole during which most myocardial perfusion occurs. Long-term prognosis in patients with chronic stable angina pectoris is favourableand medical and interventional therapies show similar benefit. Thus, current treatment guidelines advocate an initial approach with medical therapy. – Beta-blockers reduce myocardial ischaemia and prevent angina pectoris largely by lowering heart rate and are recommended as an initial therapy for stable angina pectoris, unless contraindicated. –

In modern clinical practice, however, many patients with stable angina pectoris require treatment with more than one anti-anginal drug, in addition to short-acting nitrates. Ivabradine is a pure heart rate-lowering agent that acts by inhibiting I f, an important ionic current involved in the pacemaker activity in cells of the sino-atrial node. Ivabradine reduces the slope of spontaneous diastolic depolarization in these cells and lowers heart rate at rest and during exercise. Given as monotherapy (with short-acting nitrates allowed as required), ivabradine has demonstrated anti-ischaemic and anti-anginal efficacy in randomized trials in patients with chronic stable angina pectoris when compared with placeboand has been shown to be non-inferior to atenololor amlodipine. The drug has been recommended for the medical management of patients with stable angina pectoris who are intolerant of beta-blockers or in whom these agents are contraindicated.

The primary purpose of the present study was to evaluate the anti-ischaemic and anti-anginal efficacy of ivabradine, relative to placebo, when given to patients with chronic stable angina pectoris receiving beta-blocker therapy.

### Benefits of cardiac… [^116FwJyr]. AAFP (2016). Low credibility.

Benefits of Cardiac Rehabilitation The benefits of cardiac rehabilitation have been repeatedly demonstrated over the past three decades, and include reduction in cardiovascular risk, enhanced emotional well-being, and improvement in several other outcomes. REDUCED CARDIOVASCULAR RISK In a study of more than 600, 000 Medicare beneficiaries hospitalized for acute coronary syndromes, stable ischemic heart disease, or revascularization procedures, there was a reduction in mortality rates among patients attending cardiac rehabilitation programs vs. those not attending. Patients were compared based on the number of sessions attended. At one year and five years, the mortality rates were lower for those who attended 25 or more cardiac rehabilitation sessions.

Additionally, among patients attending 25 or more sessions, subgroup analyses showed that women, nonwhites, and older adults had greater benefit. 18 Another study further defined the inverse relationship between number of sessions attended and mortality. Compared with patients who attended 12 to 24 sessions, patients who attended all 36 exercise training sessions had decreased risks of death and MI over the four-year study. 19 Another study found reductions in cardiac-specific and all-cause mortality rates among patients participating in cardiac rehabilitation after percutaneous coronary interventions.
20. 21 In a more recent study on exercise training and depression in patients with heart failure, completion of the exercise training program was associated with a 40% decrease in the presence of depression.

16 Improvements in depression were most notable among those who experienced an improvement in functional capacity, but only small improvements in functional capacity were needed to decrease depression. OTHER BENEFITS Cardiac rehabilitation has been shown to increase functional capacity as measured by exercise tolerance and peak oxygen consumption. 15 Other parameters that demonstrate improvement include weight loss, lipid control, and management of comorbidities. 22 It is not possible, however, to definitively attribute these improvements to cardiac rehabilitation because conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia may be managed pharmacologically by a primary care physician outside of the rehabilitation program.

### Part II. medical management of chronic stable angina… [^1125eAVH]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

Management of stable angina includes eliminating or controlling specific coronary risk factors, implementing lifestyle changes to reduce the risk of coronary artery disease, controlling precipitating factors and prescribing appropriate anti-ischemic medicines. 1 Measures for eliminating or modifying risk factors include control of hypertension and diabetes, a reduction of the cholesterol level, smoking cessation, weight reduction to the patient's ideal body weight, regular exercise and avoidance of strenuous activities that are known to precipitate angina. Correction of precipitating conditions such as anemia, valvular disease and arrhythmias is also important. 3 They exert their actions by blocking beta 1 and beta 2 receptors on myocardial and smooth muscle cells. Inhibition of beta receptors on the myocardium decreases both the heart rate, especially during exercise, and the force of contraction, leading to a decrease in myocardial oxygen demand.

As the heart rate slows, the diastolic period is prolonged, enabling increased oxygen delivery by improving myocardial perfusion. Combination therapy with beta blockers and nitrates 10 or calcium channel blockers 11 decreases the degree of cardiac ischemia and improves exercise tolerance. However, use of diltiazem or verapamil with a beta blocker requires careful monitoring of the heart rate and blood pressure, as this combination has additive effects on the sinus and atrioventricular nodes. If prohibitive bradycardia develops, a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker is an effective alternative to diltiazem or verapamil. A meta-analysis of 25 studies, which included 29, 000 patients, demonstrated that antiplatelet therapy was associated with a statistically significant reduction in nonfatal infarctions or strokes and a 15 percent reduction in total vascular mortality.

14 Specifically, aspirin in a daily dose of 300 to 325 mg resulted in a 24 percent risk reduction in total vascular events. This effect was equivalent to that occurring with higher dosages of aspirin. A similar conclusion was drawn from a subsequent meta-analysis of studies that included a significant number of high-risk patients, elderly patients and women with chronic stable angina, as well as those with unstable angina. Five-year follow-up revealed a 42 percent reduction in the risk of coronary death, a 34 percent reduction in the risk of major coronary events and a 37 percent reduction in the risk of myocardial revascularization.

### Benefits of exercise training in patients with heart failure… [^1115aYhW]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

Patients with congestive heart failure suffer from decreased exercise tolerance and functional deterioration. Exercise has been shown to increase aerobic capacity, delay anaerobic metabolism and increase vagal tone. Belardinelli and colleagues studied the effect of a long-term moderate exercise program on outcome and quality of life, seeking also to identify patients who benefit the most from exercise training. In this prospective, randomized controlled trial, 99 of 110 eligible patients with stable, chronic heart failure agreed to participate. Most of the patients were men. Patients were excluded if they had an ejection fraction of greater than 40 percent, arrhythmias, unstable angina, recent acute myocardial infarction, decompensated congestive heart failure, hemodynamically significant valvular disease, uncontrolled hypertension, renal insufficiency or significant pulmonary, orthopedic or neurologic limitations.

One half of the patients underwent a 14-month exercise program initiated with a two-month conditioning period consisting of exercise three times per week. The program required a warm-up, followed by riding an exercise bike at 60 percent of their peak oxygen consumption for 40 minutes. After eight weeks, patients dropped down to two exercise sessions per week for 12 months. The control group did not exercise. Ninety-four patients completed the protocol, with an average attendance at training sessions of 89 percent. No patient had a significant cardiovascular event during training sessions. In the exercise group, self-reported quality of life questionnaires demonstrated significant and continued improvement starting at two months and continuing throughout the follow-up period. More than half of the patients had cardiac events — 37 in the control group and 17 in the exercise group.

Of the nonfatal events, eight occurred in the exercise group and 17 in the control group. Hospital readmission rates for heart failure were significantly lower in the exercise group as well. The authors conclude that a long-term moderate exercise program improves functional capacity and hospital readmission rates in patients with stable chronic heart failure. Quality of life improved for patients in the exercise group in this study, although this hasn't been the case in all studies similar to this one. Mortality is also lower in the exercise group. This benefit can be achieved with only two to three exercise sessions each week.

### Stable coronary artery disease: treatment… [^111pZqTf]. AAFP (2018). Low credibility.

WHAT IS NEW ON THIS TOPIC Stable Coronary Artery Disease An RCT of 200 patients with severe single-vessel coronary stenosis found no differences between groups in exercise time or anginal relief six weeks after percutaneous coronary intervention or a sham procedure. LIFESTYLE MODIFICATION Engaging in 30 to 60 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity five to seven days per week and increasing daily lifestyle activities have been shown to reduce cardiovascular mortality and possibly all-cause mortality in patients with stable CAD, although they do not seem to reduce the risk of MI or revascularization. 1, 5, 6 Exercise is safe in patients with stable CAD. Exercise testing is not needed before starting low- to intermediate-intensity programs, although patients at high risk should be enrolled in a medically supervised program for eight to 12 weeks.

7 Smoking cessation is recommended for all patients with or at risk of CVD because cessation decreases morbidity and mortality rates to those of nonsmokers roughly 10 years after quitting. 1, 3 Physicians should offer pharmacotherapy or referral to smoking cessation programs if necessary. 1, 2 All patients with stable CAD should receive annual influenza vaccination to decrease the risk of cardiovascular events.
8. NITRATES Their quick onset of action has made short-acting nitrates the preferred agent for immediate relief from anginal symptoms. Long-acting formulations are also available but have not been shown to reduce the number of episodes, improve exercise tolerance, or decrease the need for short-acting nitroglycerin compared with beta blockers or CCBs. 29 Long-acting nitrates are used primarily as an alternative or adjunctive treatment when beta blockers and/or CCBs do not adequately relieve symptoms.
29.

It is important to note that PCI does not improve mortality in patients with stable CAD, but it may improve symptoms. However, the most recent and best-designed study to date on the effect of PCI on symptoms comes from a study of 200 patients with 70% or greater single-vessel stenosis and ischemic symptoms who were randomized to PCI or a sham procedure. 63 Six weeks after the procedures, there was no difference between groups in symptomatic outcomes such as angina frequency score, quality-of-life scores, or exercise treadmill time.

### Patient information: cardiac rehabilitation… [^116mmvYh]. JAMA Network (2021). Excellent credibility.

Cardiac rehabilitation is a carefully planned program that combines supervised physical activity, nutritional teaching, weight management, and lifestyle modification to help people with heart disease live healthier lives. The goals of cardiac rehabilitation are to regain strength and improve exercise endurance, prepare for return to work or activities of daily living, decrease symptoms, optimize cardiovascular risk factors, and help people live longer by preventing worsening of heart disease and life-threatening events. Heart or heart-lung transplant Current stable angina Stable heart failure Peripheral arterial disease It may be unsafe for patients with certain medical conditions to participate in cardiac rehabilitation, so a doctor's referral is required.

Phase 1: Patients are encouraged to perform range-of-motion exercises, sit in a chair, or take walks around their rooms or hospital floors while they are still hospitalized. Phase 2: After discharge from the hospital, patients can participate in supervised exercise programs during which heart rhythm, heart rate, blood pressure, and symptoms are monitored. The exercise program in phase 2 includes low-impact aerobic activities and strength training and typically has a 5- to 10-minute warm-up followed by training for 30 to 45 minutes, concluding with a cool-down period. Phase 2 programs include educational sessions to address nutrition, smoking, blood glucose control, managing medication regimens for blood pressure and cholesterol, and achieving or keeping a healthy weight. Screening for depression with referral for psychological well-being is also addressed.

Some medical centers offer a more intensive lifestyle program. Medicare covers up to 36 sessions; participants generally attend in-person sessions 2 to 3 times per week for 12 to 18 weeks. Phase 3: After completing phase 2, patients may choose to continue with weekly exercise or educational sessions. This phase is unmonitored and generally not covered by Medicare. Some of the potential benefits of cardiac rehabilitation include decreased risk of death from a heart-related illness; decreased hospitalizations; decreased rates of depression; decreased symptoms such as anginal chest pain and fatigue; and improved physical conditioning, exercise tolerance, and quality of life.
