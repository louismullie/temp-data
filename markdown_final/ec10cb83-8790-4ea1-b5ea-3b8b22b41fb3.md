## Question

What is a stepwise management approach for temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorder?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about a stepwise management approach for temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorder. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the initial assessment and diagnostic framework to classify TMJ pathology accurately. Then, I should outline first-line conservative therapies, followed by minimally invasive interventions for refractory cases. Next, I will consider indications and techniques for open surgery and total joint replacement. After that, I should integrate adjunctive and multidisciplinary care, including pain medicine and rheumatology for systemic disease. Finally, I need to emphasize key principles, safety considerations, and evidence strength while correcting any overgeneralizations as I go along [^116VtrAG].

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic foundation, because management hinges on etiology and stage. A thorough history and physical should classify whether symptoms are myofascial, intra-articular, neurologic, traumatic, or psychiatric, since these categories predict different response patterns and escalation thresholds, but I need to verify how much we can rely on the exam alone [^116VtrAG]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about imaging; clinical evaluation is crucial, yet MRI is often necessary to define disk–condyle relationships, effusions, synovitis, and soft-tissue derangements, while CT better delineates bony pathology such as osteoarthritis or ankylosis, although the clinical impact of effusion per se is inconsistent and not reliably associated with arthralgia, so I should be cautious about overinterpreting fluid on MRI without correlating the exam [^116oYZZA] [^1129e4RF]. I need to ensure baseline functional measures are documented for tracking, including visual analog scale (VAS) pain scores and the Jaw Functional Limitation Scale (JFLS), as these are the primary outcomes repeatedly used in interventional cohorts and guide stepwise escalation [^112ZAmkq] [^115eUbcw].

> Next, I will outline first-line conservative management, since most TMJ disorders improve without invasive care and premature escalation can cause harm. Patient education on parafunctional habit reduction, jaw rest, and a soft diet should be initiated early, but I should confirm occlusal splints are appropriate for the phenotype; stabilization or pivot splints can offload the joint and enhance tissue recovery in internal derangements, though evidence quality varies and custom-fabricated devices are preferable to improvised materials, as even single-case experiences suggest rapid improvement when the mechanical problem is addressed, while I should acknowledge the low level of evidence for improvisations like gauze-based splints outside emergent settings [^116oYZZA] [^1153zxDV] [^114AYqtg]. I should double-check pharmacotherapy basics: NSAIDs are reasonable first-line analgesics, and for bruxism-associated myofascial pain at night, cyclobenzaprine 10 mg orally at bedtime is an FDA-labeled adjunct for TMJ disorder in adults, but I need to screen for sedation risk and interactions before prescribing it [^116rTFBp] [^112cygQ2].

> I will now examine the role of exercise therapy, because active rehabilitation is often underutilized. Wait, let me verify the magnitude of benefit; systematic review and meta-analysis indicate that mobility-focused or mixed exercise programs provide moderate short-term pain reduction and range-of-motion gains, with variable long-term effects, so I should set appropriate expectations, reinforce adherence, and re-evaluate at defined intervals before escalating care [^113psjmK].

> For patients who remain symptomatic after a reasonable trial of conservative therapy, I need to consider minimally invasive options judiciously. Arthrocentesis with lysis and lavage can decompress inflamed compartments and improve mobility in internal derangements; hold on, I should verify technical advances, as an ultrasound-guided single puncture technique can reach both upper and lower compartments in selected cases, potentially reducing perforations and adverse events in experienced hands, though data are early and limited to cadaveric and very small clinical series [^116XXGwm]. I should confirm that imaging and clinical correlation support an intra-articular pain generator before proceeding, as effusion alone does not prove arthralgia and could mislead intervention selection [^1129e4RF].

> Now, let me consider arthroscopic interventions for refractory intra-articular disease. At first, I thought that level I/II arthroscopy across Wilkes III–V would be uniformly supported, but wait, the cited cohort specifically evaluated advanced degenerative disease with Wilkes V and arthroscopically confirmed disc perforation; still, level II arthroscopic debridement was associated with improvements in pain and quality of life on JFLS and VAS, suggesting a role in end-stage degenerative IPD, with patient selection being key to outcomes [^112ZAmkq]. I should also check whether adjuncts help multidimensional pain; combining TMJ arthroscopy with intramuscular botulinum toxin A to masseter and temporalis reduced pain scores more than arthroscopy alone in refractory concomitant myofascial pain, indicating neuromuscular contributors should be addressed in parallel rather than assuming purely intra-articular pathology [^115eUbcw].

> But wait, what about condylotomy for osteoarthritis refractory to conventional care? Initially, I considered it established for humans, but I should correct that the supporting evidence provided is an animal model in rabbits demonstrating remodeling and reversal of OA changes after condylotomy, so any translation to clinical practice must be cautious and individualized pending stronger human data [^114Gitjp].

> Next, I should review open surgical options reserved for structural end-stage disease or failed minimally invasive care. Discectomy is indicated for non-salvageable or perforated disks; although traditionally open, an arthroscopic discectomy series showed large VAS pain reductions and improved maximum incisal opening at 6 months, which supports the durability of disk removal in carefully selected cases, but I need to verify that rehabilitation and occlusal stability plans are in place to sustain function postoperatively [^1179akCN]. For ankylosis, gap arthroplasty with interpositional grafts such as temporalis fascia or auricular cartilage plus early mobilization and aggressive physiotherapy is critical to functional recovery, though outcomes may vary with chronicity and delay to intervention, so planning for intensive postoperative rehabilitation is non-negotiable [^115DQbq3] [^112R77yE].

> Hold on, I should verify facial nerve safety in open approaches, because iatrogenic nerve injury is a major preventable complication. Techniques such as the deep subfascial preauricular approach and a modified endaural approach with peripheral SMAS dissection provide improved exposure while protecting the frontal branch, with series reporting no temporary or permanent palsy, which reassures me that approach selection and meticulous dissection materially lower risk [^11611CXb] [^116gem75].

> For truly end-stage TMJ pathology or multiple failed surgeries, I need to ensure total joint replacement is considered in a disciplined, multidisciplinary setting. Customized alloplastic reconstruction via combined intraoral (mandibular) and extraoral (fossa) approaches has been reported as safe and effective, maintaining occlusion and function with low infection and nerve injury rates, though case-series designs necessitate careful patient selection and counseling, and intraoperative navigation protocols may further improve safety and accuracy in complex ankylosis cases requiring bilateral replacement [^116iVFvj] [^115b2Yp9].

> I should also remember specialized scenarios where targeted procedures apply. For chronic recurrent dislocation, eminectomy or modified eminectomy can prevent condylar locking by addressing the bony obstacle, although persistent capsular laxity or muscle incoordination may still require adjunctive rehabilitation strategies to prevent recurrence, so I shouldn't overpromise a purely mechanical fix [^1149uYfh]. In the rare event of TMJ herniation into the external auditory canal, an endoscopic transcanal repair offers minimal invasiveness and favorable cosmetic outcomes, but I must confirm the diagnosis with appropriate imaging and coordinate otologic and maxillofacial expertise to mitigate recurrence risk [^113Zzb9i].

> Let me now integrate multidisciplinary and adjunctive care, since psychosocial and neuromuscular factors modulate pain chronicity. When conservative measures plateau, referrals to physical therapy for targeted jaw exercises, dentistry for occlusal management, psychiatry/psychology for cognitive-behavioral strategies, and maxillofacial surgery for procedural evaluation should be sequenced thoughtfully to avoid fragmented care, and I should emphasize that psychological interventions have documented efficacy across chronic pain populations, including TMJ pain, supporting their routine incorporation alongside somatic treatments [^116VtrAG] [^111u4GPQ]. For refractory localized joint pain after multiple interventions, denervation may be considered in highly selected cases, but I need to counsel on facial nerve risks and limited evidence, reserving it for last-line scenarios within experienced centers [^113StuLQ].

> I need to ensure systemic inflammatory conditions are not missed, particularly in children and young adults where TMJ arthritis may be silent but destructive. In juvenile idiopathic arthritis and rheumatoid arthritis with TMJ involvement, coordination with rheumatology for disease-modifying therapy and biologics is essential, and clinicians should recognize that condylar alterations can progress despite treatment, necessitating longitudinal imaging and function tracking; MRI-based quantification of synovitis can aid early detection, but I must interpret enhancement within the context of normal background enhancement in some TMJs to avoid overdiagnosis [^116rTFBp] [^1172zxZa] [^114gEu1Y] [^112Lp4xu] [^115MsyjG].

> Before concluding, I should double-check key principles to guide escalation decisions. Treatment is generally indicated when pain or dysfunction is present, and premature referral or invasive intervention can worsen outcomes and prolong suffering, so progression should remain evidence-based and response-driven, with explicit goals of pain reduction, improved range of motion, and quality of life, while adopting surgical approaches that minimize facial nerve injury through proven exposure techniques and meticulous technique [^116oYZZA] [^116VtrAG] [^11611CXb] [^116gem75].

> Lastly, let me reconsider epidemiology and trauma-related contributors to ensure comprehensive counseling. TMJ disorders are common in older adults as well, underscoring the need for age-appropriate evaluation and conservative-first strategies, and macrotrauma can precipitate inflammatory and degenerative changes within the TMJ, so a history of facial injury should prompt longer-term follow-up and early consideration of arthrocentesis or arthroscopy when intra-articular pathology persists despite conservative measures, rather than attributing symptoms solely to myofascial strain [^112KByog] [^117WB5aY].

The stepwise approach to TMJ disorders prioritizes **conservative first-line care** with **escalation only as needed** [^116VtrAG]. Start with **patient education, self-care, and NSAIDs**; if symptoms persist, add physical therapy and occlusal splints. When conservative measures fail, consider **minimally invasive procedures** such as arthrocentesis or arthroscopy, reserving open surgery or total joint replacement for severe, refractory cases [^116iVFvj]. This stepwise strategy balances efficacy, safety, and cost-effectiveness.

---

## Step 1: initial conservative management

### Patient education and self-care

- **Education**: Explain the benign nature of most TMJ disorders and the importance of self-care [^116VtrAG].

- **Diet**: Soft diet, avoid wide mouth opening, and limit parafunctional habits (e.g. gum chewing, nail biting) [^116VtrAG].

- **Thermal therapy**: Apply moist heat or cold packs to reduce pain and muscle spasm [^116VtrAG].

- **Stress management**: Use relaxation techniques and stress reduction strategies [^111u4GPQ].

---

### Pharmacologic therapy

- **NSAIDs**: Ibuprofen or naproxen for pain and inflammation [^116VtrAG].

- **Muscle relaxants**: Cyclobenzaprine 10 mg PO qHS for muscle spasm [^112cygQ2].

- **Short-term anxiolytics**: Consider for significant anxiety or stress-related muscle tension.

---

### Physical therapy

- **Exercises**: Jaw stretching, strengthening, and posture correction [^113psjmK].

- **Manual therapy**: Soft tissue mobilization and myofascial release.

- **Modalities**: Ultrasound or TENS for pain relief [^116VtrAG].

---

### Occlusal splints

Occlusal splints include **stabilization splints** worn at night to reduce bruxism and muscle hyperactivity, and **repositioning splints** for specific internal derangements [^116oYZZA].

---

## Step 2: minimally invasive interventions

If symptoms persist after 3–6 months of conservative care, consider **minimally invasive options** [^116VtrAG].

---

### Arthrocentesis

Arthrocentesis is indicated for **persistent pain or limited mouth opening** from internal derangement or inflammation. The procedure involves lavage of the joint space with saline or lactated Ringer's solution, often with a corticosteroid injection, and typically yields pain relief and functional improvement with low complication rates [^116XXGwm].

---

### Arthroscopy

Arthroscopy is indicated for **internal derangement, synovitis, or adhesions** unresponsive to conservative care. It enables minimally invasive visualization and treatment of intra-articular pathology, yielding significant pain relief and functional improvement [^112ZAmkq].

---

## Step 3: surgical interventions

Reserve surgery for **severe, refractory cases** with significant structural abnormalities.

---

### Open joint surgery

Open joint surgery is indicated for **severe internal derangement, ankylosis, or degenerative joint disease**. Procedures include discectomy, disc repositioning, or condylotomy, which can improve pain and function but carry a higher risk of complications [^115DQbq3].

---

### Total joint replacement

Total joint replacement is indicated for **end-stage degenerative joint disease or ankylosis**. The procedure involves replacing the joint with an alloplastic prosthesis and typically provides significant pain relief and functional improvement, though potential complications exist [^116iVFvj].

---

## Step 4: adjunctive therapies

Adjunctive therapies can be integrated at **any stage** to enhance outcomes [^116VtrAG].

---

### Psychological interventions

Psychological interventions include **cognitive behavioral therapy** to address chronic pain, stress, and anxiety, and **biofeedback** to reduce muscle tension and pain [^111u4GPQ].

---

### Acupuncture

Acupuncture may be used as an adjunct for **pain relief and muscle relaxation**, with outcomes of reduced pain and improved function [^116VtrAG].

---

### Botulinum toxin injections

Botulinum toxin injections are indicated for **refractory myofascial pain or bruxism**, with expected outcomes of reduced muscle hyperactivity and pain [^115eUbcw].

---

## Step 5: multidisciplinary care and follow-up

Team-based care coordinates dentistry, physical therapy, psychology, and surgery, with **regular follow-up** to monitor outcomes and guide treatment adjustments [^116VtrAG].

---

## Summary table: stepwise treatment approach

| **Step** | **Interventions** | **Indications** | **Outcomes** |
|-|-|-|-|
| 1 | - Education <br/> - Self-care <br/> - NSAIDs <br/> - Muscle relaxants <br/> - Physical therapy <br/> - Occlusal splints | Mild to moderate TMJ disorders | Pain relief, improved function [^113psjmK] [^116oYZZA] |
| 2 | - Arthrocentesis <br/> - Arthroscopy | Persistent symptoms after conservative care | Significant pain relief, improved function [^116XXGwm] [^112ZAmkq] |
| 3 | - Open joint surgery <br/> - Total joint replacement | Severe, refractory cases | Improved function, pain relief [^115DQbq3] [^116iVFvj] |
| 4 | - Psychological interventions <br/> - Acupuncture <br/> - Botulinum toxin injections | Adjunctive therapy at any stage | Enhanced pain relief, improved function [^111u4GPQ] [^115eUbcw] |
| 5 | - Multidisciplinary care <br/> - Regular follow-up | Ongoing management | Sustained improvement, relapse prevention [^116VtrAG] |

### Temporomandibular joint disk displacement: Etiology, diagnosis, imaging, and therapeutic approaches [^116oYZZA]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2023). Low credibility.

An estimated 8 to 15% of women and 3 to 10% of men currently suffer from temporomandibular disorders. It has been reported that sounds are a common finding, observed in 28% to 50% of the adult population. These sounds are almost always connected to "internal derangements", a condition in which the articular disk is displaced from its position on the mandibular condyle. Due to the multifactorial etiology of temporomandibular joint dysfunction, an accurate diagnosis based on clinical examination alone often proves to be difficult. A clinical examination should be utilized together with other imaging methods to determine the relationship between the disk and condyle before and after treatment.

In general, management of temporomandibular joint-related conditions is necessary when pain or dysfunction is present. Many surgical or nonsurgical methods of treatment have been reported. The occlusal splint is one of the most widespread treatments. It induces slight vertical condylar distraction and eliminates the occlusal factor, which can be responsible for temporomandibular joint disturbances. It achieves this by removing the influence of the teeth on the joint position through slight joint distraction, which in turn enables damaged connective tissue to heal.

### Is advanced arthroscopic debridement in patients with end-stage temporomandibular joint degenerative joint disease associated with improved quality of life and pain reduction [^112ZAmkq]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2025). Low credibility.

Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) advanced arthroscopic debridement (level II arthroscopy) is a minimally invasive procedure involving microsurgical debridement of degenerated tissues with the help of a fiber-optic camera. Its use for treating intra-articular pain and dysfunction (IPD) in advanced TMJ degenerative disease remains debated.

- **Purpose**: The primary purpose was to evaluate if level II arthroscopy was associated with improvement in pain and quality of life in subjects with advanced TMJ degenerative disease, and to identify clinical factors that influence outcomes.

- **Study design, setting, sample**: This was a retrospective cohort study conducted on subjects who presented to the University of Michigan Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinic between November 2020 and July 2023 and required arthroscopy for IPD. Inclusion criteria were unilateral or bilateral IPD, Wilkes V disease, arthroscopically verified disc perforation, and a 3-month minimum follow-up. Subjects with level I/III arthroscopy or with Wilkes I-IV disease were excluded.

- **Covariates**:
	- **Demographics**: age, sex
	- **Preoperative variables**: body mass index, allergies, environmental sensitivities, condylar degeneration, systemic arthropathy, serology, prior arthrocentesis, preoperative jaw functional limitation scale (JFLS), pain
	- **Operative variables**: synovitis, chondromalacia, adhesions, laterality, debridement, injections

- **Main outcome variables**: Primary outcomes were changes in quality of life and pain measured via the JFLS and visual analog pain scale, respectively.

### Total customized alloplastic reconstruction for treatment of severe temporomandibular joint pathologic conditions: A case series of combined intraoral and extraoral approach [^116iVFvj]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) reconstruction with customized alloplastic implants has become a safe and effective treatment option for TMJ end-stage pathology, with excellent outcomes reported in the literature. The purpose of this study is to report five cases of severe TMJ pathology and customized alloplastic reconstruction using a combined intraoral and extraoral approach.

Four patients with TMJ involved due to benign tumors and one patient with severe TMJ resorption were enrolled. Compromised joints were replaced with customized prostheses under general anesthesia, using an association of intraoral and extraoral approaches. An implant handpiece with adapted drills for bone drilling and the insertion of screws was used to fixate the mandibular component intraorally; the fossa component was inserted via the preauricular approach. Hemimandibulectomies/codilectomy with a safety margin were successfully performed, and for two patients, orthognathic surgery was also required.

The follow-up period ranged from 15 to 28 months, with an average of 22 months, showing no history of surgical site infection or damage to the prostheses. Occlusal relationship and function, as well as facial symmetry, were kept stable in all patients. The combination of an intraoral and extraoral approach for total TMJ replacement with customized prostheses may be an alternative and reliable strategy for pathologic reconstruction, maintaining function and reducing aesthetic damage.

### Temporomandibular disorder treatment algorithm for otolaryngologists [^116VtrAG]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2021). Low credibility.

To review literature describing the management of temporomandibular disorder (TMD) and propose an evidence-based algorithm for otolaryngologists, a literature review using PubMed and Scopus was conducted. This review identified manuscripts describing TMJ disorder etiology, diagnostic methods, and management across the fields of otolaryngology, general practice medicine, physical therapy, dentistry, and maxillofacial surgery. Two reviewers subjectively evaluated the studies based on the inclusion criteria, which were then incorporated into a comprehensive algorithm.

TMD is one of the most common conditions presenting to otolaryngology outpatient clinics. The etiologies of TMD vary widely, including myofascial, intraarticular, neurologic, traumatic, or psychiatric origins. When conservative measures fail to produce symptom relief, alternative treatments and referrals to outside specialists — including psychiatry, physical therapy, dentistry, and maxillofacial surgery — may be indicated. Premature or inappropriate referrals may lead to patients suffering from TMD for extended periods, with alternating referrals between various specialists. Thus, we present a TMD treatment algorithm for otolaryngologists to aid in the decision-making process in managing TMD.

Patients frequently present to otolaryngology outpatient clinics for symptoms of TMD. Multidisciplinary practice may be necessary to effectively treat TMD of varying etiology and severity. Following conservative treatment, appropriate referrals and treatment strategies are critical for effective management.

### Condylotomy to reverse temporomandibular joint osteoarthritis in rabbits [^114Gitjp]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2019). Low credibility.

Osteoarthritis (OA) of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) is characterized by local tissue degeneration and pain. Treatments have been aimed at reducing symptoms, and only some can interfere with the progression of pathophysiologic changes caused by OA. Condylotomy is an alternative treatment for patients with OA refractory to conventional treatment. The aim of the present animal study was to investigate the influence of condylotomy on TMJ OA in New Zealand rabbits.

- **Materials and methods**: The 36 rabbits were divided into 3 groups: the osteoarthritis group (OG; induced OA), treatment group (TG; induced OA plus condylotomy), and control group (CG; neither OA nor surgery). OA was induced using intra-articular monosodium iodoacetate injection for 40 days. The rabbits in the TG underwent condylotomy and were killed 20, 40, and 60 days after treatment. The rabbits in the CG and OG were killed at the same points.

- **Results**: The articular joint condition was better in the TG 60 days after surgery (P = 0.032). A direct comparison revealed regression of TMJ OA over time among the treated rabbits (P = 0.008). Surgical treatment promoted mandibular condylar remodeling in the TG, reversing the tissue degeneration caused by OA.

- **Conclusions**: Our findings suggest that condylotomy could be an option for the treatment of OA and prevent damage to TMJ structures. This could be of particular importance for patients without satisfactory responses to more conservative treatment.

### Surgical management of patients with Eagle syndrome [^1158FtNJ]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2018). Low credibility.

Eagle syndrome, a spectrum of disease resulting from an elongated styloid process and/or calcified stylohyoid ligament, lacks standardized recommendations regarding indications for surgical intervention and approach. This retrospective cohort study was conducted in a single tertiary care institution and involved patients treated surgically for Eagle syndrome between January 2011 and June 2017.

Patients were diagnosed based on thorough clinical workup and assessment. The primary outcome was improvement in pain severity following surgery, with complete resolution of pain being considered clinically meaningful. Wilcoxon rank-sum tests and Fisher's exact tests were used to compare numerical and categorical variables, respectively.

Twenty-one patients were diagnosed with Eagle syndrome and underwent surgical resection of the styloid process. Patients most often complained of neck pain (81%), throat pain (62%), and ear pain (48%). Among these patients, 57% of procedures featured a transcervical approach, while the remaining 43% were transoral. The vast majority (90%) of patients experienced improvement in pain severity from a median of 6.0 before surgery to 0.0 afterwards (p < 0.01), with 62% experiencing complete resolution. Using multivariable linear regression to model changes in pain severity, neck pain (β = -1.69, p < 0.01) and jaw pain (β = -0.93, p = 0.03) predicted greater relief, while headache (β = 0.82, p = 0.04) predicted an inferior response. Adverse events were uncommon and typically resolved within three months, with 24% experiencing such events.

### Effectiveness and costs of a stepwise versus an all-in-one approach to diagnose mild bleeding disorders [^114BhjYF]. British Journal of Haematology (2023). High credibility.

The diagnostic work-up of patients referred to the haematologist for bleeding evaluation is typically performed in a stepwise manner. Bleeding history and results of screening laboratory tests guide further diagnostic evaluation. However, this can be ineffective, time-consuming, and burdensome for patients. To improve this strategy, the initial laboratory investigation can be extended.

In a model-based approach, the effectiveness and costs of a conventional stepwise versus a newly proposed all-in-one diagnostic approach for bleeding evaluation were evaluated and compared, using data from an observational patient cohort study that included adult patients referred for bleeding evaluation. In the all-in-one approach, specialized platelet function tests, coagulation factors, and fibrinolysis tests were included in the initial investigation. Final diagnosis, hospital resource use and costs, and patient burden were assessed.

A total of 150 patients were included. Compared to the stepwise approach, the all-in-one approach resulted in an additional 19 patients reaching a diagnosis with lower patient burden, although total costs per patient were higher [€359, 95% bootstrapped confidence interval (BCI) 283–518, p = 0.001]. For bleeding evaluation of patients referred to the haematologist, an all-in-one diagnostic approach has a higher diagnostic yield and reduces patient burden, albeit at a higher cost. This raises the question of what costs justify the diagnosis of a bleeding disorder and a less burdensome diagnostic strategy.

### Does adjunctive botulinum toxin A reduce pain scores when combined with temporomandibular joint arthroscopy for the treatment of concomitant temporomandibular joint arthralgia and myofascial pain [^115eUbcw]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2017). High credibility.

The current lack of a standard care protocol for treating refractory myofascial pain and concomitant temporomandibular joint (TMJ) arthralgia prompted this comparative study. It aimed to determine the effectiveness of botulinum toxin A (Btx) as an adjunct to TMJ arthroscopy in this patient population.

- **Study design and methods**: A retrospective cohort study was conducted on patients who underwent TMJ arthroscopy with (Btx group) or without (control group) intramuscular Btx for TMJ arthritis and refractory myofascial pain at the University of Michigan (Ann Arbor) from 2011 through 2014. In the Btx group, intramuscular injections of Btx were administered at sites of maximal tenderness within the masseter and temporalis muscles. The primary outcome was the pain score on the visual analog scale (VAS; 0 to 10). Secondary outcomes included maximal interincisal opening, total score for sites of tenderness, total number of tender sites, and diet consistency tolerated. Statistical analysis included means and standard deviations, Student t-test, simple regression analysis, and multiple regression analysis.

- **Results**: The study cohort comprised 52 patients (30 in the Btx group and 22 in the control group), with 48 (92.3%) being women. The mean follow-up was 5.56 ± 1.41 months. Patients in the Btx group exhibited a significantly greater decrease in mean pain score (P = 0.04) on the VAS compared with the control group (mean score: 3.24 for the Btx group; 1.13 for the control group). On multivariate regression analysis, treatment with Btx trended toward significance.

Overall, the study findings suggest that adjunctive use of Btx may effectively reduce pain in patients undergoing TMJ arthroscopy for refractory myofascial pain and TMJ arthralgia.

### A new surgical approach for the treatment of chronic recurrent temporomandibular joint dislocation [^1149uYfh]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Chronic temporomandibular joint (TMJ) dislocation is defined as the complete loss of articular relationships during wide mouth opening between the articular fossa of the temporal bone and the condyle-disk complex. The most frequent pathogenetic factors involved in chronic dislocation of the TMJ are thought to be trauma, abnormal chewing movements, TMJ ligaments and capsule laxity, as well as masticatory muscle disorders. TMJ dislocation occurs more frequently in people with general joint laxity and in patients with internal derangement of the TMJ or occlusal disturbances.

Management of TMJ dislocation remains challenging. Eminectomy, whose validity has been demonstrated by several authors, acts on the bony obstacle, preventing condylar locking. However, it does not have a therapeutic effect on TMJ ligament and capsular laxity or masticatory muscle incoordination, which seem to be the primary causes of TMJ dislocation. The authors present a minimally invasive modified technique of eminectomy, which aims to address both the bony obstacle and the underlying causes while respecting and restoring TMJ biomechanical constraints.

### Endoscopic-assisted repair of spontaneous temporomandibular joint herniation through a transcanal approach [^113Zzb9i]. Otology & Neurotology (2019). Low credibility.

To report the presentation, diagnosis, and management of a spontaneous temporomandibular joint (TMJ) herniation, a case involving a 69-year-old man with a spontaneous TMJ herniation is discussed. The interventions included diagnostic evaluation and surgical approaches.

- **Main outcome measures**: Imaging, and medical and surgical treatment outcomes were assessed. At 14 months follow-up, the patient reported improved tinnitus. Examination showed no evidence of a hypertrophic scar or canal stenosis, no recurrence of TMJ herniation, and no signs of otorrhea or otalgia, with normal TMJ function.

- **Conclusions**: The advantages of repairing spontaneous TMJ herniation through a transcanal approach using oto-endoscopy include a high-definition video of the surgical field, minimal invasiveness, and good postoperative cosmetic outcome.

### Automatic protein structure solution from weak X-ray data [^114b13LX]. Nature Communications (2013). Low credibility.

Automated structure solution systems use a stepwise approach (Fig. 1a) for structure solution but can use different programmes or parameters for experimental phasing, density modification, or model building. To objectively assess the new algorithm's (Fig. 1b) power in a controlled fashion, we compare it against the stepwise algorithm using the same programmes and parameters. For both approaches, real-space density modification is performed in PARROT (version 1.0.2), and automated model building is performed in BUCCANEER (version 1.5.2). The new combined function, implemented in REFMAC, simultaneously uses the information from real-space density modification and model building, whereas the approach uses this information separately in stepwise phase combination and model refinement functions, also implemented in REFMAC.

The automated structure solution package CRANK (version 2.0.0) is used to link these programmes for both approaches in this test. To assess the performance of the combined structure solution approach against another automated package, we also compare the new method against the default, recursive, stepwise approach of PHENIX AutoSol (version 1.8.2–1309). We find that the new combined algorithm performs significantly better in both the controlled test and in comparison with PHENIX, and led to many models built automatically when the approaches failed.

### Complex regional pain syndrome: Practical diagnostic and treatment guidelines, 5th edition [^111u4GPQ]. Pain Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Comparative efficacy of psychological interventions in other non-CRPS chronic pain disorders: Numerous RCTs have documented the efficacy of various psychological approaches to managing chronic pain in general. These have been quantitatively summarized in several published meta-analyses. Treatment approaches examined include many of the same interventions used in the CRPS studies described previously, including relaxation techniques, autogenic training, biofeedback, behavioral therapy, and cognitive behavioral therapy. More recent approaches such as mindfulness-based and ACT techniques are also included.

The results of several meta-analyses clearly document the efficacy of these techniques for non-CRPS chronic pain conditions. For example, a meta-analysis of clinical trials testing progressive muscle relaxation techniques found significant effects in various chronic pain conditions, reflecting a moderate effect size. Meta-analysis specifically of autogenic training, another relaxation procedure, indicated a significant and at least moderate effect size in controlled trials for patients with headaches and somatoform pain disorder. Significant efficacy for biofeedback training is also indicated by meta-analyses in populations, including temporomandibular joint pain and migraine headache patients.

More generally, meta-analyses of RCTs across psychological treatment types — various treatments provided both alone and in combination — indicate significant efficacy of this class of techniques for a variety of chronic pain conditions, including low back pain and fibromyalgia.

### Management of external auditory canal anterior wall defect: A case series and literature review [^111B2Zv8]. Otology & Neurotology (2023). Low credibility.

When applying the stepwise approach, precaution is needed to determine which patients are indicated for revision surgery. Primary repair of the EAC wall defect cannot guarantee a completely solid EAC wall; thus, mild residual movement of the area during mastication is unavoidable. Although incessant, if the severity of symptoms improves after surgery and the degree of EAC wall fluctuation does not aggravate over time, observation is preferred over revision surgery. Nonetheless, if the graft material had migrated from its original position or if the combined infection had not subsided with pharmacologic management, the surgeon should not be hesitant to perform a secondary operation for exploration and possible retrieval of the dislodged graft material. Depending on the patient's situation, reattempt of primary defect closure may be an option, wherein canalplasty by drilling the posterior EAC wall may be a preferable approach. If conventional canalplasty does not offer sufficient EAC width, canal wall-down mastoidectomy can be considered as a third-line treatment.

Our study has its limitations as it only involved 10 cases because of the low incidence of EAC anterior wall defects. Of the 10 patients, 3 patients who underwent primary repair via the endaural approach showed treatment failure, making a bias toward the preauricular approach. In addition, all 10 cases used a titanium mesh for reconstruction of the EAC defect; therefore, analysis of the differences among reconstruction materials used is also inapplicable. Furthermore, we lack long-term data for three cases in which we were unable to follow up completely.

### Temporomandibular condylar alterations in juvenile idiopathic arthritis most common in longitudinally severe disease despite medical treatment [^1172zxZa]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2014). Low credibility.

If one or both condyles were judged as "unreadable", the individual was excluded from further analysis. Most of the radiographs, 86%, were digital and analyzed on monitors, one at the Department of Clinical Oral Physiology at the Eastman Institute in Stockholm and one at the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Radiology, University of Gothenburg. Analogous radiographs, 14%, were analyzed in an X-ray light box. Fifty randomly selected cases were evaluated until consensus was reached a second time after three weeks in order to establish the reliability of the evaluation over time.

The total pharmacological treatment was evaluated longitudinally from disease onset, established by the rheumatologist, to the time of the panoramic examination. Medication with DMARDs, which included MTX, and/or biologically modifying medications, including tumor necrosis factor alpha inhibitors (TNF-alpha) and/or corticosteroid injections in the TMJ, was denoted "potent medication". Fifteen patients received corticosteroid injections in the TMJ, but only 4 without simultaneous DMARDs, and therefore further analyses were not possible. The use of "potent medication" for six months or more was denoted a "medication period". An evaluation of medical treatment was performed for each six-month period during the first year after onset and thereafter once every year until panoramic examination. A period shorter than six months of medication or the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) were not included.

Five disease activity groups yielded a modified version of the European League Against Rheumatism system.

### Ultrasound-guided single puncture technique to simultaneously reach the upper and lower temporomandibular joint compartments for arthrocentesis or injections purposes: A technical note [^116XXGwm]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2024). Low credibility.

Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) arthrocentesis is a widely described and effective technique that promotes lysis and lavage of TMJ compartments, improving pain and mandibular range of motion. Mostly, this technique has been used to reach the upper TMJ compartment, although effusion may also be present in the lower compartment, which may need to be assessed in the absence of disc perforation. Here, we propose an adaptation of the arthrocentesis technique aimed at accessing both the upper and lower compartments of the TMJ with a single needle puncture and guided by ultrasound real-time images.

The technique was initially established in fresh cadavers and later replicated in two patients. This modification proved to be efficient and reproducible, reducing the number of perforations and, consequently, possible adverse events. The proposed technique can be applied to arthrocentesis and/or intra-articular injections through the combination of two previously validated techniques, improving its safety and efficacy.

### Is there an association between temporomandibular joint effusion and arthralgia [^1129e4RF]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

The literature on joint effusion (JE) and its association with clinical and radiologic variables in patients with temporomandibular disorders (TMDs) is inconsistent and characterized by multiple methodological limitations. The primary aim of this investigation was to evaluate the association between magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) identified JE and temporomandibular joint (TMJ) arthralgia. The secondary aim was to determine the association between JE and other clinical and MRI-identified soft tissue characteristics.

A retrospective cohort study was conducted in accordance with the Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders guidelines. The dependent variable was JE, and the primary independent variable was arthralgia. Secondary independent variables included TMJ pain-associated characteristics and MRI-identified variables. Pearson χ² tests or t-tests were used to determine statistical associations between JE and clinical characteristics, as well as between JE and MRI-identified variables. Additionally, generalized estimating equation (GEE) modeling was conducted to identify which independent clinical and MRI-identified variables were associated with JE.

Data from 158 participants, representing 312 joints, were analyzed. The mean age of the female participants (59.4%) was 31 ± 11.1 years, while the mean age for male participants (40.6%) was 29.8 ± 9.7 years. No association was found between JE and arthralgia. However, statistically significant associations were noted between JE and other variables.

### Multidisciplinary approach and the self-training educative pain sensation (STEPS) model for managing orofacial complex regional pain syndrome [^117NGjZ8]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). Low credibility.

Orofacial CRPS is a rare chronic pain condition affecting the face and mouth, with an estimated incidence rate of 38.7 per 100,000 people per year globally. It is a less common form of CRPS, which typically affects the upper and lower limbs. O-CRPS is characterized by severe, burning, or throbbing pain in the face and mouth, often accompanied by other symptoms such as swelling or changes in skin texture, increased sensitivity to touch, temperature, or light, difficulty opening or closing the mouth, dryness or excessive drooling, tinnitus (ringing in the ears), and vision changes.

Diagnosing orofacial CRPS (O-CRPS) is particularly challenging for healthcare providers and dentists, specifically due to the overlap with various orofacial pain (OFP) conditions. OFP encompasses a wide range of issues, such as temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorders, neuropathic pain, and systemic disorders. This complexity necessitates a meticulous assessment, often involving imaging and nerve conduction studies to rule out other possibilities. While there is no single definitive test for O-CRPS, the Budapest criteria from the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) guide diagnosis.

This report acknowledges the scarcity of O-CRPS cases within the Saudi healthcare system and highlights the successful application of an interdisciplinary approach in patient management. Given the complexities of O-CRPS diagnosis and management, an interdisciplinary approach has been used, fostering collaboration.

### Management of orofacial manifestations of juvenile idiopathic arthritis: Interdisciplinary consensus-based recommendations [^115MsyjG]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2023). Low credibility.

This process generated three overarching principles and twelve recommendations pertaining to the following five domains: diagnosis, treatment of TMJ arthritis (defined as active TMJ inflammation), treatment of TMJ dysfunction and symptoms, treatment of arthritis-related dentofacial deformity, and other related aspects. A full reference list for articles supporting the generation of each of the twelve recommendations is available in the Supplementary Material on the Arthritis & Rheumatology website.

- **Recommendations for the management of temporomandibular joint (TMJ) arthritis and the related orofacial manifestations of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA)**:

	- The level of evidence provided in the available literature regarding the support of these principles and recommendations varied, falling at either steps 2, 3, or 4 on the OCEBM level of evidence table (ranging from step 1 [highest level of evidence] to step 5 [lowest level of evidence]). In general, the levels of evidence were low. Hence, this proposal should be regarded as conditional, where the voting panel finds that the desirable effects outweigh the undesirable effects, but the members of the panel appreciate that uncertainties exist related to resources, settings, and costs.

### A stepwise approach to the surgical management of hemorrhagic choroidal detachments [^117NcbHt]. Journal of Vitreoretinal Diseases (2021). Low credibility.

Hemorrhagic choroidal detachments are a rare but serious complication of trauma or intraocular surgery. While most cases resolve spontaneously or with medical management, surgical drainage is generally indicated when there is an appositional hemorrhagic choroidal detachment, which can lead to retinal adhesions; persistent decreased visual acuity; a flat anterior chamber, which can lead to keratolenticular adhesion, pupil block, and peripheral anterior synechiae; or persistent or progressing choroidal detachment despite conservative therapy.

- **Scleral cutdown approach**: The established drainage method is the scleral cutdown approach, which involves a radial or circumferential incision through the sclera over the region of most prominent detachment. The scleral cutdown approach is effective but invasive, involving large conjunctival cutdown, manipulation of the rectus muscle, and elevated risk of hypotony, perforation, or retinal damage.

- **Transconjunctival approach**: A transconjunctival approach involving a trocar system is a much more delicate and less invasive alternative.

This article describes a stepwise surgical approach to draining choroidal detachments that begins with the transconjunctival approach and can easily progress to a scleral cutdown approach if necessary. Two cases are provided to illustrate key features of this approach. In both cases, an appositional hemorrhagic choroidal detachment developed a hypotonic eye and was resolved with this stepwise approach.

### A protocol for the management of maxillofacial injuries in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic [^116GU5pu]. Injury (2020). Low credibility.

The oral and maxillofacial region, and by extension its surgery, is associated with an increased risk of transferring the SARS-CoV-2 virus. During a pandemic, it is imperative to implement a protocol-based management of maxillofacial injuries. This approach should be based on current literature that is clear, straightforward, executable, and adaptable to rapidly changing situations. In the present study, the author conducted a literature review to develop a straightforward protocol. This protocol is designed to be readily applicable for managing maxillofacial injuries, providing clinicians with guidance on current actions and cautioning about the future implications of their present decisions.

### Temporomandibular joint ankylosis in a child: An unusual case with delayed surgical intervention [^115DQbq3]. BMC Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) ankylosis in a child is rare, and the causes remain unclear. This condition not only affects feeding and potentially causes airway obstruction but also poses a significant challenge to surgeons. Furthermore, it interferes with facial skeletal and dento-alveolar development in the growing child.

- **Case presentation**: In this case report, we present the management of a 7-year-old with left TMJ ankylosis discovered since infancy. Clinical and imaging investigations were consistent with left temporomandibular joint ankylosis (Type IV), possibly secondary to childhood septic arthritis. Left gap arthroplasty via a modified Al Kayat Bramley and retromandibular approach was performed, with interpositional arthroplasty placement of a temporalis fascia graft. No complications from the surgery, except reduced mouth opening, were observed. Possible contributing factors to this less than satisfactory mouth opening are addressed.

- **Conclusion**: We describe an unusual case of childhood temporomandibular joint ankylosis, possibly due to septic arthritis with delayed surgical intervention. The etiology, classifications, timing, and choice of surgical techniques along with their considerations and complications are discussed. Although there is no consensus on the surgical treatment of TMJ ankylosis, early mobilization, aggressive physiotherapy, and close follow-up are advocated by many authors for successful treatment.

### The effectiveness of exercise therapy for temporomandibular dysfunction: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113psjmK]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2017). High credibility.

The objective of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of exercise therapy on pain, function, and mobility outcomes in patients with temporomandibular joint dysfunction.

- **Study design**: The research is a systematic review with a meta-analysis.

- **Methods**: A systematic review and meta-analysis were undertaken following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Studies that met the inclusion criteria were considered for review: (1) randomized controlled trials; (2) a population diagnosed with temporomandibular joint dysfunction; and (3) interventions that included exercise therapy. When studies demonstrated homogeneity on outcome measures, the mean differences or standardized mean differences with a 95% confidence interval were calculated and pooled in a meta-analysis for a comprehensive synthesis.

- **Results**: Six articles, with a total of 419 participants, were included in the review, and only four studies were included in the meta-analysis. Mobility and mixed exercise therapy approaches appear to be the most common exercise approaches utilized for the management of temporomandibular joint dysfunction. Exercise therapy and the associated dosage provide moderate short-term and varying long-term benefits in the reduction of pain and improvement of the range of motion in patients with temporomandibular joint dysfunction.

- **Conclusion**: Included studies suggest a mobility or mixed approach to exercise therapies significantly impacts reducing pain and increasing the range of motion, but lacks a significant impact on functional improvement.

- **Level of evidence**: Therapy, level 1a.

### The deep subfascial approach to the temporomandibular joint [^11611CXb]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

The aim of the present study was to improve safety and visibility in the surgical approach to the temporomandibular joint (TMJ). Despite the development of numerous surgical approaches to the TMJ, the facial nerve remains at risk for damage. For this reason, the authors present an additional, safe, surgical approach to avoid injuries of the facial nerve during TMJ surgery, termed "the deep subfascial approach".

Two resident surgeons, under the supervision of the Department Chief, performed 29 surgical exposures of the condyle, safely using the deep subfascial approach. This technique is carried out via a modified preauricular incision followed by subfascial dissection, passing under both layers of the deep temporalis fascia. Neither permanent nor temporary motor loss of the frontal branch of the facial nerve was observed after surgery. It was not necessary to ligate the superficial temporal vessels, except for the posterior branch of the superficial temporal artery. Aesthetic results were excellent in all cases.

The operation is technically facile, surgically uncomplicated, and clinically effective. It is our opinion that the deep subfascial approach to the TMJ represents a safe method to avoid injury to the facial nerve. We suggest this surgical procedure as a routine and safe approach to the TMJ and to the zygomatic arch, especially in second procedures or in delayed treatments.

### Genome-wide association reveals contribution of MRAS to painful temporomandibular disorder in males [^111tMVcS]. Pain (2019). Low credibility.

Other findings from the discovery study implicated genes with the potential for intriguing pathophysiological insights but should be considered provisional until they can be reproduced in independent cohorts. We were not able to identify any relevant functionality for rs5862730, the indel on chromosome 4, through our bioinformatics approaches, nor were we able to conclusively pinpoint the gene responsible for the effect.

The most promising nearby candidate gene is SMAD1, a transcriptional modulator involved in cell growth and development, most prominently through mediation of signaling by bone morphogenetic proteins. Although a clear link between SMAD1 and TMD pain has not been confirmed, other SMAD pathway genes have been linked to acute inflammatory (but not neuropathic) pain and excitability of DRG neurons, as well as osteoarthritis of the temporomandibular joint. Furthermore, our group found that TGFβ1 regulation of cytokines such as MCP-1 and IL-8, which is mediated by SMAD protein activation, is consistently inhibited in the plasma of TMD cases relative to controls.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^1127cufW]. GINA (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for asthma, specifically concerning stepwise management, the GINA 2025 guidelines recommend the following alternative stepwise approach for managing asthma in adult and adolescent patients. An as-needed inhaled corticosteroid-short-acting β-agonist or as-needed short-acting β-agonist is used as the reliever in all steps:

- **Step 1, symptoms ≤ 1–2 days per week**: Offer low-dose inhaled corticosteroid whenever a short-acting β-agonist is taken, either in combination or with separate inhalers.

- **Step 2, symptoms 3–5 days per week, with normal or mildly reduced lung function**: Offer low-dose maintenance daily ICS plus as-needed short-acting β-agonist.

- **Step 3, symptoms on most days of the week, or waking due to asthma ≥ 1 per week, or low lung function**: Offer low-dose ICS-LABA plus as-needed short-acting β-agonist, or plus as-needed ICS-short-acting β-agonist, or medium-dose ICS plus as-needed short-acting β-agonist, or plus as-needed ICS-short-acting β-agonist.

- **Step 4, daily symptoms or waking at night due to asthma ≥ 1 per week, and with low lung function or recent exacerbation**: Offer medium-dose ICS-LABA plus as-needed short-acting β-agonist, or plus as-needed ICS-short-acting β-agonist, or high-dose ICS plus as-needed short-acting β-agonist as another option, though adherence is worse than with combination ICS-LABA.

- **Step 5**: Offer add-on LAMAs. Refer for phenotypic assessment. Consider offering high-dose maintenance ICS-LABA; consider offering anti-IgE, anti-IL-5/5R, anti…

### Three-dimensional computed tomographic assessment of temporomandibular joint stability after orthognathic surgery [^117LZeon]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Ensuring that the condyle is appropriately positioned and that positional changes are minimal is considered crucial for the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) to function without symptoms after orthognathic surgery. The purposes of this study were to evaluate condylar changes after surgery and to examine the association between these changes and TMJ symptoms.

A retrospective cohort study was conducted in patients with mandibular prognathism who underwent orthognathic surgery. Linear and angular changes in the positioning of the condyle were measured by superimposing three-dimensional computed tomograms taken before surgery and three months after surgery. Clinical symptoms of TMJ pain and sound were recorded at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after surgery. Possible associations between TMJ symptoms and clinical variables, such as postoperative condylar changes, were investigated using multiple logistic regression analysis.

Linear condylar displacement after orthognathic surgery occurred predominantly in the anterior, medial, and inferior directions, with minimal changes (< 1 mm) observed. Most angular condylar changes were smaller than 4° and occurred in the inward direction in the axial plane and the posterior direction in the sagittal plane. The best predictor of postoperative TMJ signs and symptoms was the preoperative status of TMJ signs and symptoms. Neither linear nor angular condylar displacement showed a relevant influence on postoperative pain and sound.

Within the ranges of linear (< 1 mm) and angular (< 4°) condylar displacement, not.

### Temporomandibular joint involvement in juvenile idiopathic arthritis: Reliability and validity of a screening protocol for the rheumatologist [^114gEu1Y]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Regarding disease activity, the JADAS-27 was used for correlation with the TMJ protocol because the TMJ examination is not included in this score. If the TMJ examination had been included in the disease activity score, as in the JADAS-71, the calculated correlation with the TMJ protocol would be biased. The aim of the investigation was to test the validity of the protocol against a reference score. We chose the disease activity JADAS-27 to avoid circular reasoning. Although the JADAS-71 might be more suitable as a disease activity score from a clinical standpoint, methodological considerations predominated our choice for the JADAS-27.

The cut-off value for reduced MMO has been suggested throughout the literature as 10 years of age. Measuring MMO, as we did, indicated a wide range of MMO per age category in a population of 20,709 schoolchildren. The authors concluded that "the use of a cut-off point for the assessment of MMO in children with potential affection of the masticatory system could not be recommended". The authors state that even the percentiles "will not be able to solve the dilemma of interpretation of a single MMO measurement". However, they "hope that the percentile charts will become an important tool for longitudinal follow-up of children with a high risk for TMJ affections, e.g. children with JIA".

### Analogy between non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and hypertension: A stepwise patient-tailored approach for NASH treatment [^116qBjkD]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a common liver disorder worldwide. Although there has been improvement in our understanding of the natural history and pathogenesis of the disease, there is still no approved therapy for NASH. NASH shares many similarities with primary hypertension in that both are extremely common disorders that can easily lead to serious complications if left untreated. Both conditions are viewed as "silent killers" because the disease can progress over a period of time prior to the occurrence of potentially deadly outcomes.

While attempts to find the "miracle pill" for NASH are unrealistic, we can make an analogy with the "stepwise combination" approach developed over the last few decades for the treatment of hypertension. In the present review, we summarize some of the similarities in the concepts that underlie NASH and hypertension. The development of a stepwise patient-tailored method for the treatment of NASH is presented.

### Combined treatment protocol for temporomandibular joint ankylosis: An observation on a clinical problem [^112R77yE]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Various techniques have been defined for the treatment of temporomandibular joint ankylosis. However, in some cases, they are unsuccessful, resulting in continuing pain and limitation in interincisal distance after surgery. This report describes the case of a 32-year-old woman who has been experiencing temporomandibular joint ankylosis for a period of 8 years. Several surgical procedures failed. A treatment approach combining auricular cartilage interposition arthroplasty with postsurgical functional treatment using a spring activator is presented. Using this approach, pain settled, and maximal interincisal distance increased from 22 to 35 mm after 4 months, remaining stable for a further 10 months.

### Temporomandibular joint dislocation reduction technique: A new external method vs. the traditional [^112GyBGK]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

The traditional intraoral approach for temporomandibular joint dislocation reduction, although effective, has some disadvantages. Here, a new extraoral approach is described. This study was performed to evaluate this new method's success rate. Patients visiting an emergency room were randomly allocated to two groups: one group received reduction with the extraoral approach, and the other with the intraoral method. Among 29 attempts with the conventional method, 25 were successful (86.2%; 95% confidence interval: 73–100), and among 29 attempts with the external method, 16 were successful (55.2%; 95% confidence interval: 39–79). This difference was statistically significant. Because of the benefits of the external approach, such as avoiding hand bites and disease transfer, it can be a reasonable choice to reduce a dislocated temporomandibular joint.

### Temporomandibular condylar alterations in juvenile idiopathic arthritis most common in longitudinally severe disease despite medical treatment [^112muCH1]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is an autoimmune, heterogeneous disease, and the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) can be affected, with consequences for mandibular growth and function. The aim of this study was to evaluate the importance of longitudinal medical treatment and the burden of disease activity on the development of temporomandibular condylar alterations as judged on panoramic radiographs.

- **Methods**: The study was a retrospective evaluation of dental and medical records in consecutive JIA patients referred to three specialist dental clinics in Sweden during an eight-year period. Data on the total pharmacological treatment and disease activity were evaluated longitudinally from disease onset to the time of the panoramic examination, during a median observation period of 2.5 years. The radiographs were analyzed in terms of structural and shape alterations in the condyles and judged dichotomously.

- **Results**: Panoramic examinations were analyzed in 158 patients from 266 referrals diagnosed with JIA. Condylar alterations (shape or structural) were seen in 68 patients (43%). Patients with condylar alterations were more extensively treated over time compared with those without condylar alterations. Powerful disease activity and/or potent medication at any time during the course of the disease implied an increased risk of alterations.

- **Conclusions**: Patients with JIA who require more intensive medication over time run the greatest risk of condylar alterations. As yet, medical programs have not been specified for the TMJ, and more knowledge in this area is needed.

### Management of external auditory canal anterior wall defect: A case series and literature review [^116mUSmp]. Otology & Neurotology (2023). Low credibility.

Interestingly, all previous case reports focused on the effect of surgical EAC defect repair, understating the possible risks and complications of a surgical approach for the management of the symptoms. Not all reports disclosed detailed postoperative follow-up results, but the mean follow-up period for the published cases was approximately 9 months. Because the follow-up period falls short of 1 year postoperatively, there is a chance that delayed symptom recurrence and late-onset complications that occur a few years after the procedure may not have been considered. This raises the question of whether surgical reconstruction of the EAC is currently overvalued.

Unlike previous studies, we recommended annual follow-ups, even for those who immediately showed satisfactory symptom resolution. Although the initial surgery was successful in many cases, not all patients achieved complete symptom resolution after the first surgery. Primary repair is particularly difficult in cases with large EAC defects, and even with successful grafting, some patients experience persistent symptoms due to mild residual fluctuation. In such cases, revision surgery is inevitable, and posterior canalplasty is performed to secure EAC patency. Two patients experienced refractory postoperative infection, which eventually led to revision surgery to retrieve the titanium mesh and subsequent canal wall-down mastoidectomy or subtotal petrosectomy. Hence, it is impractical to standardize the surgical treatment.

### The association between research diagnostic criteria for temporomandibular disorder findings and biting force and endurance in patients with temporomandibular disorders [^111MYRbA]. Pain Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

This study was designed to evaluate the association between examination findings based on research diagnostic criteria for temporomandibular disorders and performances on bite force and endurance tasks.

- **Methods**: Subjects were 126 patients with temporomandibular disorder and 34 pain-free controls. A subset of patients with temporomandibular disorder (n = 56) also were evaluated following a brief conservative 4-week treatment intervention.

- **Results**: A multivariate analysis of variance indicated that female patients (P < .001), but not males (P = 0.17), had lower bite forces than age- and gender-matched controls. Dental examination findings were significantly but modestly predictive of bite task performance (R² = 0.175), with higher joint pain and smaller maximum unassisted jaw opening associated with lower bite force. The brief treatment interventions resulted in both self-reported and clinically determined improvements. Clinical and self-reported improvement significantly predicted pre-post treatment changes in biting force among female subjects (R² = 0.237). Specifically, reduction in joint palpation pain and self-reported pain (McGill Pain Questionnaire short form) were the primary predictors of increases in bite force. The improvement in biting force was modest (mean = 7 lb), and the force levels of female patients remained lower than those of control subjects. Treatment did not significantly increase endurance time.

- **Discussion**: The brief conservative treatments used resulted in improvements in pain and jaw opening, and 81.8% of patients reported moderate to major improvements.

### Quantifying temporomandibular joint synovitis in children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis [^112Lp4xu]. Arthritis Care & Research (2016). Low credibility.

- **Discussion**: Inflammatory arthritis of the TMJ affects the majority of patients with JIA but cannot be reliably assessed by history or physical examination. The utility of conventional radiographs, such as plain films and panoramic radiographs, for evaluating TMJ inflammatory arthritis is limited because of poor sensitivity in identifying early condylar erosion and the inability to detect synovitis. Conversely, MRI is sensitive for detecting both condylar erosion and synovitis, but this assessment is typically qualitative (mild, moderate, or severe) and subjective. Furthermore, the specificity of synovitis as a marker for inflammatory arthritis is unclear, as some degree of synovial enhancement is commonly seen in normal TMJs (Figure 1). A reliable and simple method for quantifying TMJ synovitis and differentiating it from normal background synovial enhancement would facilitate early detection and treatment.

We developed a technique to quantify TMJ synovial enhancement on contrast-enhanced MRIs and tested this method on patients with JIA and controls without TMJ disease. This assessment is easy to use, can be applied using virtually any radiology software, and has excellent reproducibility and interexaminer consistency. The use of an internal standard controls for variations in MRI machines and technique.

Our analysis determined that an ER of 1.55 discriminates between TMJs with synovitis and unaffected controls with a sensitivity of 91% and a specificity of 96%. Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that ERs of 1.55, 1.70, 1.90, and 2.00 were effective markers.

### The differential diagnosis of children with joint hypermobility: A review of the literature [^115hzogf]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2009). Low credibility.

In this study, we aimed to identify and review publications relating to the diagnosis of joint hypermobility and instability, and develop an evidence-based approach to the diagnosis of children presenting with joint hypermobility and related symptoms.

- **Methods**: We searched Medline for papers with an emphasis on the diagnosis of joint hypermobility, including heritable disorders of connective tissue (HDCT).

- **Results**: A total of 3330 papers were identified. Among them, 1534 pertained to instability of a particular joint, 1666 related to the diagnosis of Ehlers-Danlos syndromes, and 330 related to joint hypermobility.

	- There are inconsistencies in the literature on joint hypermobility and how it relates to and overlaps with milder forms of HDCT. There is no reliable method of differentiating between joint hypermobility syndrome, familial articular hypermobility, and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (hypermobile type), suggesting these three disorders may be different manifestations of the same spectrum of disorders. We describe our approach to children presenting with joint hypermobility and the published evidence and expert opinion on which this is based.

- **Conclusion**: There is value in identifying both the underlying genetic cause of joint hypermobility in an individual child and those hypermobile children who have symptoms such as pain and fatigue and might benefit from multidisciplinary rehabilitation management. Every effort should be made to diagnose the underlying disorder responsible for joint hypermobility, which may only become apparent over time. We recommend that the term "Joint Hypermobili…

### Protocol for single-stage bilateral temporomandibular joint replacement using intraoperative navigation in patients with ankylosis [^115b2Yp9]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Treatment of patients with bilateral temporomandibular joint (TMJ) ankylosis in a single-stage procedure can be challenging. The implementation of intraoperative navigation has proved beneficial by enabling faster and safer excision by providing real-time identification of vital structures. Navigation also can be used to verify site preparation for custom joint prostheses. This article seeks to establish a protocol, based on the use of intermaxillary fixation screws, to produce accurate and repeatable outcomes for the correction of bilateral TMJ ankylosis with total joint replacement in a single-stage procedure.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^111LDEbp]. GINA (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for asthma, specifically with respect to stepwise management, the GINA 2025 guidelines recommend using the following track as the preferred stepwise approach for managing asthma in adult and adolescent patients, with as-needed low-dose ICS-formoterol as the reliever in all steps:

- **Steps 1–2. Symptoms ≤ 5 days per week, with normal or mildly reduced lung function**: Offer as-needed-only low-dose ICS-formoterol.

- **Step 3. Symptoms on most days of the week, or waking due to asthma ≥ 1 per week, or low lung function**: Offer low-dose ICS-formoterol maintenance-and-reliever therapy.

- **Step 4. Daily symptoms or waking at night due to asthma ≥ 1 per week, and with low lung function or recent exacerbation**: Offer medium-dose ICS-formoterol maintenance-and-reliever therapy.

- **Step 5**:
	- Offer add-on LAMAs.

### Modified endaural approach with a peripheral dissection of the superficial musculoaponeurotic system to access the temporomandibular joint to prevent facial nerve injury [^116gem75]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2024). High credibility.

The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of protecting the facial nerve with a modified endaural approach with a peripheral dissection of the superficial musculoaponeurotic system to access the temporomandibular joint, which allows an excellent operative field of visualization, multiple surgical procedures of the temporomandibular joint, and general care. This approach improves the immediate postoperative period, making it a less morbid surgery. The study included 33 patients (39 sides) who underwent surgical treatment for disorders of the temporomandibular joint from 2021 to 2023 at the Maxillofacial Department of the Clinic "Colsanitas" located in Bogota, Colombia. Therapeutic results were evaluated by postoperative facial nerve injury using the House-Brackman scale; every patient was examined for adequate facial musculature function immediately after surgery. Notably, zero patients presented facial nerve injury. These results imply that the modified endaural approach with a peripheral dissection of the superficial musculoaponeurotic system to access the temporomandibular joint reduces the incidence of facial nerve injuries, improves operative site exposure, and lowers the frequency of complications.

### Transmasseteric anterior parotid approach for treatment of mandibular subcondylar fractures [^115Xyuqx]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

This study demonstrated the application of the transmasseteric anterior parotid approach for open reduction of mandibular subcondylar fractures, based on the anatomical study of the temporomandibular joint and parotid gland area. The anatomical study was performed on five Chinese adult cadavers fixed with 10% formalin. The temporomandibular joints and parotid regions were examined.

In the clinical study, 26 patients with mandibular subcondylar fractures were recruited between July 2014 and December 2017. All 26 patients achieved satisfactory occlusions and normal mouth opening; importantly, no postoperative facial paralysis occurred in these patients.

Understanding the anatomy of both the temporomandibular joint and parotid region is crucial for significantly reducing surgical trauma and complications. The transmasseteric anterior parotid approach is a feasible method for the surgical treatment of mandibular subcondylar fractures. This method provides adequate exposure, minimal facial nerve injury, easy open reduction, and inconspicuous scarring.

### Arthroscopic discectomy technique: A beneficial approach for managing disk perforations in the temporomandibular joint [^1179akCN]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2024). Low credibility.

Disk perforation can result in degenerative changes within the joint structures. While discectomy has demonstrated enduring benefits, it has traditionally been described using an open approach, which comes with inherent disadvantages. This study presents a series of patients who underwent an arthroscopic discectomy technique and reports the outcomes.

- **Methods**: Patients diagnosed with internal disorders of the temporomandibular joint underwent an arthroscopic discectomy technique. Surgical outcomes were assessed by changes in pain using a visual analog scale and the maximum incisal opening.

- **Results**: One hundred seventy-eight joints from 106 patients who underwent arthroscopic surgery were included. Discectomy was performed on 22 joints. Prior to surgery, patients reported an average visual analog scale pain score of 6.5, which decreased to an average of 0.5 at 6 months post-surgery (P < 0.001). Before surgery, the average maximum incisal opening was 30 mm, which increased to 41 mm at 6 months post-surgery (P < 0.001).

- **Conclusions**: The described technique represents an excellent alternative for managing patients with disk perforations.

### Diagnosis and management of temporomandibular joint dysfunction before surgery: a case report [^1153zxDV]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

We present a case of colorectal cancer with temporomandibular joint dysfunction and discuss the management of the case. Type IIIb temporomandibular disorder involves anterior dislocation of the articular disk, trismus, and difficult intubation. A 68-year-old woman was scheduled for colectomy. The day before surgery, the patient experienced temporomandibular pain. Upon examination, her mouth opening measured 13 mm, leading to a diagnosis of type IIIb temporomandibular disorder. A simple splint was fabricated using gauze, allowing the patient to achieve a mouth opening of 55 mm on the day of surgery. The pain subsided, and intubation was uneventful.

Temporomandibular disorders are generally treated by dentists. It is beneficial for general hospitals without a dentistry department to employ a dental anesthesiologist to assist in potentially difficult intubations in patients with temporomandibular disorders.

### Simultaneous management of condylar osteochondroma and secondary malformation with a new intraoral approach [^115r84Zx]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2022). Low credibility.

The present study aimed to investigate the clinical efficacy of the simultaneous management of condylar osteochondroma and its secondary dentofacial deformities using an intraoral surgical approach.

- **Methods**: Six patients with condylar osteochondroma were treated with intraoral vertical ramus osteotomies and condylar resection. The free rising branch was used for reconstructing the temporomandibular joint. Simultaneous orthognathic and plastic surgeries were performed sequentially to correct the secondary dentofacial deformities. Indices of aesthetic symmetry, occlusion relationship, temporomandibular joint function, condylar height, and volume change were assessed in the subsequent follow-up.

- **Results**: The mean follow-up period was 31 months. All patients experienced no tumor recurrence. The ipsilateral joint function, occlusal relationship, and facial symmetry were satisfactory. There was no obvious bone resorption in the ipsilateral condylar reconstruction, and the ramus height was well maintained. Postoperative assessment showed that the preoperative design was accurately fulfilled.

- **Conclusions**: The simultaneous condylar osteochondroma resection and temporomandibular joint reconstruction using an intraoral approach avoid extraoral scars and correct facial asymmetry without compromising long-term joint function and occlusal relationship.

### Do surgical intervention type and baseline condylar position affect spatial dimension changes of the temporomandibular joint in the surgical correction of skeletal class II deformities [^1149oku9]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2024). Low credibility.

One of the key features of orthognathic surgery is altering temporomandibular joint (TMJ) condylar positions.

- **Purpose**: This multivariate study aimed to identify surgical interventions and patient factors significantly associated with changes in TMJ spatial dimensions after the surgical correction of skeletal Class II deformities.

- **Study design, setting, sample**: This is a retrospective cohort study including patients who had undergone an isolated bilateral sagittal split ramus osteotomy (BSSO) or a bimaxillary osteotomy (BMO) for mandibular advancement, and a control sample of patients treated with the removal of odontogenic cysts in the mandibular posterior region. Excluded were those who presented with specific radiographic signs of TMJ osteoarthrosis, severe facial asymmetry, or deformity secondary to trauma.

- **Predictor/exposure/independent variable**: The primary predictors were condylar position at baseline (anterior, concentric, and posterior), time points (T0, preoperatively; T1, immediately after surgery; and T2, 1-year follow-up), and surgical intervention type (BSSO, BMO, and control group).

- **Main outcome variables**: The primary outcomes were changes in posterior spatial dimension (PSD), superior spatial dimension, and medial spatial dimension assessed by cone-beam computed tomography preoperatively, immediately after surgery, and at 1-year follow-up.

- **Covariates**: Covariates included sex, age, and amount of mandibular advancement.

- **Analyses**: Estimations of independent effects of primary predictors on outcome variables were made by applying generalized estimating.

### Diagnosis and management of temporomandibular joint dysfunction before surgery: a case report [^114AYqtg]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

In this case study, we discuss the treatment of a patient with type IIIb temporomandibular joint disease and trismus, administered one day prior to colectomy by a dental anesthesiologist using a simple splint.

Treatment options for temporomandibular disorder type IIIb typically include drug administration, manipulation, mobilisation, splints, and surgery. Drug therapy was deemed unnecessary due to a lack of evidence for inflammation. Manipulation and mobilisation were avoided as the patient's dental health was compromised by periodontal disease. Surgical treatment was not pursued due to its invasive nature and the potential to interfere with rectal cancer therapy.

A splint was ultimately chosen as the treatment. This decision was informed by prior experience treating a patient with acute temporomandibular disorder type IIIb with a splint, which led to improvement within a day. The rapid improvement was attributed to early intervention during the acute phase, while treatment during the chronic phase may have required more time.

Splints for temporomandibular disorders include stabilisation, repositioning, and pivot splints. For type IIIb disorders, stabilisation or pivot splints are commonly used. In this instance, a method akin to a pivot splint was employed, primarily involving the elevation of molars with gauze. A stabilisation splint was avoided as it covers the front teeth, potentially burdening patients with periodontal disease. Repositioning splints are typically applied to stabilize the jaw post-manipulation, a process challenging with gauze support.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^111DJ5mc]. GINA (2025). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for managing asthma in pediatric patients, the GINA 2025 guidelines recommend a preferred stepwise approach for children aged 6–11 years. This approach includes the use of as-needed short-acting β-agonists or low-dose ICS-formoterol as relievers in Steps 3 and 4:

- **Step 1: Symptoms ≤ 1–2 days per week**: Offer low-dose ICS whenever a short-acting β-agonist is taken, either in separate inhalers or in combination if available.

- **Step 2: Symptoms 2–5 days per week**: Offer low-dose ICS plus as-needed short-acting β-agonist. Consider offering ICS whenever a short-acting β-agonist is taken, in combination or separate inhalers, or daily leukotriene receptor antagonist as non-preferred options. Consider the probability of adherence to maintenance treatment if the reliever is a short-acting β-agonist.

- **Step 3: Symptoms on most days of the week or waking due to asthma ≥ 1 per week**: Offer low-dose ICS-LABA plus as-needed short-acting β-agonist. Offer medium-dose ICS plus as-needed short-acting β-agonist. Offer very low-dose ICS-formoterol maintenance-and-reliever therapy. Consider offering daily low-dose ICS or leukotriene receptor antagonist, plus as-needed short-acting β-agonist as a non-preferred option.

- **Step 4: Symptoms daily, waking at night ≥ 1 per week, low lung function**: Offer medium-dose maintenance ICS-LABA plus as-needed short-acting β-agonist. Offer low-dose ICS-formoterol maintenance-and-reliever therapy.

### Review of basal-plus insulin regimen options for simpler insulin intensification in people with Type 2 diabetes mellitus [^113nd64u]. Diabetic Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

For people with Type 2 diabetes on basal insulin who require intensification, is a stepwise approach to the addition of prandial insulin an effective alternative to a full basal-bolus approach?

In the OSIRIS study, in which the stepwise addition of prandial insulin and a full basal-bolus regimen were compared, non-inferiority of glycaemic control was not achieved. Post-breakfast and post-dinner blood glucose reductions were significantly smaller for the stepwise approach than for the basal-bolus regimen. However, the efficacy of the stepwise approach was considered close to that of the basal-bolus approach, with significantly less weight gain and no significant differences in hypoglycaemia or in the proportion of participants achieving target HbA1c ≤ 53 mmol/mol (7.0%) at the 12-month endpoint. In the study by Rodbard et al, the stepwise addition of prandial insulin for 32 weeks was non-inferior to a basal-bolus regimen for glycaemic control (HbA1c), with similar weight gain, fewer hypoglycaemic episodes, and higher participant satisfaction.

- **Participant dosing details**: As shown in Table 2, in OSIRIS and in the study by Rodbard et al, the majority of participants assigned to the stepwise addition of prandial insulin did not require three doses of prandial insulin. Of all participants who received prandial insulin, 19–50% received one prandial injection per day, 34–47% received two prandial injections per day, and 13–44% received three prandial injections per day.

### Management of temporomandibular joint arthritis in adult rheumatology practices: a survey of adult rheumatologists [^116rTFBp]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2012). Low credibility.

The temporomandibular joint (TMJ) is frequently involved in juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA); however, little is known about the management of this joint once a patient transitions from pediatric to adult care and how rheumatologists approach TMJ involvement in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The objective of this project was to describe adult rheumatologists' approaches to the diagnosis and treatment of TMJ arthritis in adults with JIA or RA.

- **Findings**: One hundred and eighteen rheumatologists responded to an online survey of adult rheumatologists in the United States and Canada. Respondents estimated that 1–25% of their patients with RA or JIA had TMJ arthritis. Respondents reported lower rates of MRI use (19%) and higher rates of use of splinting/functional devices (50%) than anticipated. Approximately 80% of respondents reported that their practice had a standardized approach to the evaluation of patients with TMJ arthritis. The most commonly used medical therapies were non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs, anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha medications, and methotrexate.

- **Conclusions**: Despite the majority of respondents stating that their practices had a standardized approach to the diagnosis and treatment of TMJ disease, there nevertheless appeared to be a range of practices reported. Standardizing the evaluation and treatment of TMJ arthritis across practices may benefit both adult and pediatric patients.

### Percocet [^116rm4w5]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

There are no standard opioid tapering schedules suitable for all patients. Good clinical practice dictates a patient-specific plan to taper the dose of the opioid gradually. For patients on Percocet who are physically opioid-dependent, initiate the taper by a small enough increment (e.g. no greater than 10% to 25% of the total daily dose) to avoid withdrawal symptoms and proceed with dose-lowering at an interval of every 2 to 4 weeks. Patients who have been taking opioids for briefer periods of time may tolerate a more rapid taper.

It may be necessary to provide the patient with lower dosage strengths to accomplish a successful taper. Reassess the patient frequently to manage pain and withdrawal symptoms, should they emerge. Common withdrawal symptoms include restlessness, lacrimation, rhinorrhea, yawning, perspiration, chills, myalgia, and mydriasis. Other signs and symptoms may also develop, including irritability, anxiety, backache, joint pain, weakness, abdominal cramps, insomnia, nausea, anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, or increased blood pressure, respiratory rate, or heart rate. If withdrawal symptoms arise, it may be necessary to pause the taper for a period or raise the dose of the opioid analgesic to the previous dose, and then proceed with a slower taper. In addition, evaluate patients for any changes in mood, the emergence of suicidal thoughts, or the use of other substances.

When managing patients taking opioid analgesics, particularly those who have been treated for an extended period and/or with high doses for chronic pain, ensure that a comprehensive plan is in place.

### The role of facial trauma as a possible etiologic factor in temporomandibular joint disorder [^117WB5aY]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Facial trauma has been suggested as a possible etiologic factor of temporomandibular joint disorder. However, there is little information on the role of macrotrauma. The main purpose of this study was to validate facial trauma as a potential etiologic factor for temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorder. Multidirectional approaches were applied for the evaluation of the changes of TMJ after TMJ macrotrauma.

- **Patients and methods**: Analysis of TMJ status including arthroscopic examination, histomorphologic examination, and synovial fluid biochemical analysis were performed on patients with mandibular fractures. Additionally, the efficacy of arthrocentesis for the patients with mandibular fracture was evaluated from a functional point of view.

- **Results**: In arthroscopic examinations, evidence of synovitis with variable degrees was found; the representative findings include fibrillation and ecchymosis. On histomorphologic examination, bloody smear, degenerated cells and cartilage, inflammatory cells, and crystals were observed. In biochemical analysis, considerable amounts of prostaglandin E(2) and leukotriene B(4) were detected in the synovial fluid of the patients.

- **Conclusion**: The inflammatory and degenerative changes of the TMJ can develop after facial trauma. Trauma can be a possible etiologic factor in cartilage degeneration and biochemical and intra-articular pathology. Clinicians should recognize the etiologic importance of macrotrauma, and a long-term evaluation of the TMJ as well as adequate treatment is required for patients with facial trauma.

### Diagnosis and management of temporomandibular joint dysfunction before surgery: a case report [^117GVTrM]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

A 68-year-old woman was diagnosed with sigmoid colon cancer, and laparoscopic colectomy was planned for the next day. The day before surgery, she reported left temporomandibular joint pain and difficulty in fully opening her mouth. The opening excursion was 13 mm. Radiography using Schuller's method was conducted to confirm the mouth opening and closing positions (Figure 1). Bone ankyloses were not observed, and there was no clicking. Palpation revealed no pain or inflammation around the temporomandibular joint.

- **Figure 1**: Schuller's radiographic method (left temporomandibular joint). As indicated by the arrows, the mandibular condyle has not moved forward even in the open position. The temporomandibular joint shows no bone ankyloses or fractures in the mandible. This figure is published with the patient's consent.

Tooth movement and tooth loss were observed due to periodontal disease, causing further deviation in the occlusal diameter. It was hypothesized that the periodontal disease and deviated occlusal diameter led to anterior dislocation of the articular disk, with an overload being applied to one of the temporomandibular joints.

The patient was diagnosed with type IIIb temporomandibular disorder. A simple splint was created for management; however, due to the unavailability of materials for producing a splint in our hospital, gauze was used as a temporary measure to raise the bite (Figure 2). The patient was instructed to use the splint at all times, except when eating and drinking.

- **Figure 2**: Splint with gauze (jaw model).

### Bifurcation PCI with a hybrid strategy with drug-eluting balloons versus a stepwise provisional two-stent strategy: Rationale and design of the hybrid DEB study [^111Eor8F]. American Heart Journal (2023). High credibility.

The optimal treatment strategy for coronary bifurcation lesions by percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is complex and remains a subject of debate. Guidelines advise a stepwise provisional approach with an optional two-stent strategy. However, a two-stent strategy — both upfront and stepwise provisional — is technically demanding. There is increasing interest in the use of drug-eluting balloons (DEB) in bifurcation lesions, primarily following a provisional approach with an unsatisfactory result of the side branch. Some small pilot studies have already shown that the use of DEB in bifurcation lesions is safe and feasible. However, a randomized comparison of this hybrid DEB strategy with a two-stent strategy is currently lacking.

- **Trial design**: The Hybrid DEB Study is a prospective, multicenter, randomized controlled trial investigating the noninferiority of a hybrid DEB approach. This approach uses a combination of a drug-eluting stent (DES) in the main vessel and DEB in the side branch, compared to a stepwise provisional two-stent strategy in patients with true bifurcation lesions. A total of 500 patients with de novo true coronary bifurcation lesions, treated with a stepwise provisional approach and experiencing unsatisfactory results in the side branch after main vessel stenting (≥ 70% stenosis and/or less than thrombolysis in myocardial infarction III flow), will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either treatment with a DEB or with a DES in the side branch. The primary endpoint is a composite endpoint of the occurrence of all-cause death, periprocedural or spontaneous myocardial infarction, and/or other adverse events.

### Denervation of the painful temporomandibular joint [^113StuLQ]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

The successful management of temporomandibular joint (TMJ) pain remains elusive. Often, the initial relief of pain is complicated by the recurrence of symptoms. This time frame suggests that the pain may be related to neuromas of the nerves that innervate the TMJ. In 2003, an anatomic description of the innervation of the TMJ suggested that denervation of this joint might be the appropriate treatment for pain resistant to traditional forms of therapy.

In January 2005, this approach was used to treat recalcitrant left TMJ pain in a 21-year-old woman with congenital hearing loss who had redislocations of her TMJ articular disc. She previously had two arthroscopic surgeries and one open attempt to treat her TMJ pain. The last failed TMJ surgery created a painful neuroma that prevented her from wearing her hearing aid. A medial and lateral denervation of the TMJ joint was done. The successful results of this surgery are presented at one-year follow-up. The technical considerations of this approach and risks to the facial nerve are discussed.
