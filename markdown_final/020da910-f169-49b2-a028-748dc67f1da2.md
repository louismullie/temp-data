## Question

How does vincristine cause kCCN 2

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how vincristine causes neuropathy, specifically vincristine-induced peripheral neuropathy (VIPN). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about vincristine's core pharmacology and why neurons are uniquely vulnerable. Then, I should verify the specific molecular mechanism at the axonal level. Next, I will examine how impaired axonal transport translates into clinical phenotypes, including sensory, motor, and autonomic features. After that, I need to consider dose, schedule, and pharmacokinetic contributors. I will then review genetic and patient-specific risk factors, followed by drug–drug interactions that amplify toxicity. Finally, I should assess the natural history, including coasting and recovery, and close with practical clinical implications for prevention, monitoring, and management, making sure each claim is supported by appropriate sources.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacologic foundation. Vincristine is a vinca alkaloid that binds β-tubulin and inhibits microtubule polymerization, disrupting mitotic spindle formation and arresting dividing cells in metaphase. This antimitotic effect underpins its anticancer activity and also explains its neurotoxicity because neurons depend on intact microtubules for axonal structure and transport [^113LFHj5] [^113FEnaJ].

> Wait, let me verify the specific axonal mechanism. In peripheral nerves, vincristine promotes microtubule depolymerization, which impairs both anterograde and retrograde axonal transport of essential proteins, mitochondria, and synaptic vesicles. This transport failure leads to energy deficiency, impaired synaptic function, and ultimately axonal degeneration, a process documented by nerve biopsy and electron microscopy in humans and corroborated by in vitro and in vivo models [^113FEnaJ] [^113FKYTC].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about clinical manifestations without mapping mechanism to phenotype. Impaired transport produces a length-dependent, sensorimotor axonopathy with early loss of deep tendon reflexes, followed by paresthesias, dysesthesias, weakness, ataxia, and foot drop; autonomic involvement is common, with constipation, ileus, urinary retention, and orthostatic symptoms, reflecting the vulnerability of long, metabolically active axons in peripheral and autonomic nerves [^113FKYTC] [^113b2Uyg].

> I need to check dose, schedule, and pharmacokinetic contributors. Higher cumulative doses and more frequent administration, especially weekly schedules, increase toxicity risk; vincristine has a long terminal half-life around 80–85 hours with wide interpatient variability, so weekly dosing can lead to tissue accumulation and sustained microtubule disruption, worsening neuropathy; hepatic metabolism via CYP3A4/3A5 and biliary excretion mean hepatic dysfunction or CYP3A inhibition can raise exposure and neurotoxicity [^113LFHj5] [^117TkKr3].

> Next, I should review genetic susceptibility. Let me consider pharmacogenomics carefully. Variants in CEP72, a centrosomal protein involved in microtubule organization, have been reproducibly associated with increased risk and severity of VIPN in pediatric ALL cohorts; additional signals implicate drug transporters (ABCB1, ABCC1/2), inherited neuropathy genes (e.g. SLC5A7), and cytoskeletal regulators, supporting a model where both pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic pathways modulate risk; importantly, CEP72 effects may be phase-specific, with stronger associations during continuation therapy rather than induction, which could explain replication failures in some cohorts [^11431nbg] [^114mnKhN] [^111NL8RK].

> I should double-check patient-specific risk factors. Older age, preexisting neuropathy, and hereditary neuropathies such as Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease confer markedly increased susceptibility. Case reports and series document severe neuropathy at low cumulative doses in unrecognized CMT, and guidelines advise avoiding vincristine in demyelinating CMT due to risk of catastrophic neurotoxicity [^115d8JQ1] [^113vgCd1].

> But wait, what about drug interactions that amplify toxicity. Strong CYP3A inhibitors, particularly azole antifungals (fluconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, posaconazole), can increase vincristine exposure and neurotoxicity; NCCN explicitly warns about azole-associated neuropathy and SIADH, and clinicians often substitute or avoid azoles when vincristine is essential; case series and reviews in pediatrics reinforce this interaction as a recurrent clinical dilemma [^115TJ3PR] [^112cS4Yk] [^117JiYYC].

> Let me think about the natural history and time course. VIPN typically emerges within weeks to months of therapy, often reaching a plateau by mid-treatment. Importantly, a "coasting" phenomenon has been described, wherein symptoms and signs can worsen for weeks after the last dose, likely reflecting ongoing axonal degeneration and delayed repair. Recovery is variable, with about half improving by 3 months post-therapy, but persistent deficits lasting beyond a year are not uncommon, especially with higher cumulative exposure or genetic risk [^112s4uMz] [^112uxAYn] [^114c1Uub].

> I will now examine pediatric versus adult phenotypes to ensure I'm not overgeneralizing. In children, VIPN tends to be more motor-predominant and functionally limiting, whereas adults more often report sensory symptoms. This difference may reflect age-dependent axonal biology and developmental regulation of repair pathways, and it has implications for assessment tools and thresholds for dose modification [^117MEr5m] [^116rPryj].

> Next, I should review clinical implications for prevention, monitoring, and management. Before starting vincristine, screen for hereditary neuropathy and avoid use in demyelinating CMT. Monitor with serial neurologic exams and validated neuropathy scales (e.g. TNS, CIPN20, R-ODS), and consider early referral to physical therapy. For mild neuropathy, consider dose delay or reduction, and for moderate-to-severe toxicity, hold or discontinue vincristine. In lymphoma, substituting vinorelbine for vincristine can preserve vinca-class activity while reducing neurotoxicity, with retrospective data suggesting maintained or improved outcomes compared with simple dose reduction. Symptomatic management is limited, but duloxetine may help neuropathic pain in adults, and emerging preclinical strategies targeting Nav1.8 or neuroinflammation are under investigation [^113vgCd1] [^111SJGg1] [^117MCzCh] [^113nTkeE] [^112BHUpR].

> Hold on, I should verify one more critical safety point that often gets overlooked. Never administer vincristine intrathecally. It is fatal via the intrathecal route, and system safeguards must strictly separate intravenous vinca alkaloids from intrathecal chemotherapy in time and space to prevent catastrophic errors [^114h7vt1] [^117FZfXH].

> In summary, vincristine causes neuropathy primarily by disrupting axonal microtubules, impairing transport, and triggering axonal degeneration in long, vulnerable peripheral and autonomic fibers. Risk is shaped by dose and schedule, hepatic metabolism, inherited susceptibility in CEP72 and related pathways, and co-exposures like CYP3A-inhibiting azoles. The resulting sensorimotor and autonomic neuropathy can be dose-limiting, may coast after cessation, and can persist long term, necessitating proactive risk assessment, vigilant monitoring, and judicious use of substitutions and dose modifications to preserve both neurologic function and oncologic efficacy [^113FEnaJ] [^11431nbg] [^115TJ3PR] [^112uxAYn].

Vincristine causes neuropathy by **binding β-tubulin** and disrupting microtubule assembly, which impairs axonal transport and leads to axonal degeneration [^113FEnaJ]. This results in a **length-dependent, sensorimotor neuropathy** with paresthesias, weakness, and loss of reflexes, and can include autonomic dysfunction such as constipation and ileus [^113FKYTC]. Risk increases with higher cumulative dose, older age, pre-existing neuropathy, and CYP3A4-inhibiting drugs (e.g. azoles) [^114kafWN] [^11474FRb]. Neuropathy is often reversible with dose reduction or cessation, but recovery can be slow and incomplete [^112uxAYn].

---

## Molecular mechanism of vincristine-induced neuropathy

Vincristine binds to β-tubulin at the **vinca-binding site**, preventing polymerization and destabilizing microtubules [^113FEnaJ]. This disrupts axonal transport of mitochondria, synaptic vesicles, and signaling proteins, causing energy failure, impaired synaptic function, and axonal degeneration [^113FEnaJ].

---

## Histopathological changes

Nerve biopsy and animal studies show **axonal degeneration** with swollen, fragmented axons and demyelination, consistent with a dying-back axonopathy [^113FEnaJ].

---

## Clinical manifestations

Vincristine neuropathy is a **length-dependent, sensorimotor axonopathy** with the following features:

| **Clinical feature** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Sensory symptoms | Paresthesias, numbness, dysesthesias, loss of deep tendon reflexes |
| Motor symptoms | Weakness, foot drop, gait instability, muscle wasting |
| Autonomic symptoms | Constipation, ileus, urinary retention, orthostatic hypotension |
| Cranial neuropathies | Laryngeal paralysis, facial palsy, optic neuropathy |

---

## Risk factors

Several factors increase the risk and severity of vincristine neuropathy:

- **Cumulative dose**: Higher total dose correlates with greater neuropathy risk [^112s4uMz].
- **Patient age**: Older patients have higher incidence and severity [^116EygU9].
- **Pre-existing neuropathy**: Hereditary or acquired neuropathies (e.g. Charcot-Marie-Tooth) markedly increase risk [^11474FRb] [^113b2Uyg].
- **Drug interactions**: CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. azoles) raise vincristine levels and neurotoxicity [^115TJ3PR] [^112cS4Yk].

---

## Reversibility and management

Vincristine neuropathy is often **reversible with dose reduction or cessation**, though recovery can be slow and incomplete, especially after high cumulative doses [^115Qpzjt]. Management is supportive, including dose modification, physical therapy, and symptomatic treatment for neuropathic pain [^111SJGg1].

---

Vincristine neuropathy results from **microtubule disruption and impaired axonal transport**, causing axonal degeneration and a length-dependent sensorimotor neuropathy; risk is dose- and patient-dependent, and recovery is variable.

Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) — methotrexate is the most effective agent against PCNSL and is commonly used with procarbazine, vincristine, cytarabine, rituximab, and temozolomide; high doses of intravenous methotrexate are necessary (≥ 3.5 g/m2) to overcome the BBB and achieve therapeutic CSF levels. Intrathecal methotrexate can be useful where CSF cytology is positive and when patients cannot tolerate systemic methotrexate at 3.5 g/m2 or higher; other intrathecal options include cytarabine and rituximab. Phase II trials have shown that high-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell transplantation following high-dose methotrexate-based chemotherapy is feasible and well-tolerated with little evidence of neurotoxicity. Renal dysfunction from high-dose methotrexate is a potentially lethal medical emergency, and early intervention with glucarpidase has shown efficacy in rapidly reducing plasma methotrexate concentrations and preventing severe toxicity.

Vincristine is an effective chemotherapeutic drug for various cancers, including acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Unfortunately, clinical utility is restricted by dose‐limiting vincristine‐induced peripheral neuropathies. We sought to determine the association ofwith a recently identified risk variant, 72 rs924607, and drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion gene variants in pediatric. This was followed by a meta‐analysis of pharmacogenomic data from over 500 patients. 72 rs924607 was significantly associated with(P = 0.02; odds ratio = 3.4).analyses identified associations betweenand 1 rs3784867 (P = 5.34 × 10 −5; = 4.9), and 5A7 rs1013940 (P = 9.00 × 10 −4; = 8.6); genes involved in vincristine transport and inherited neuropathies, respectively. Meta‐analysis identified an association with a variant related to(rs10504361: P = 6.85 × 10 −4; = 2.0), a heritable neuropathy‐related gene. This study provides essential corroboratory evidence for 72 rs924607 and highlights the importance of drug transporter and inherited neuropathy genes in.

### An inherited genetic variant in CEP72 promoter predisposes to vincristine-induced peripheral neuropathy in adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia [^1132bMZb]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2017). Low credibility.

Peripheral neuropathy is a major toxicity of vincristine, yet no strategies exist for identifying adult patients at high-risk. We used a case-control design of 48 adults receiving protocol therapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who developed vincristine-induced neuropathy (NCI grade 2–4) during treatment, and 48 matched controls who did not develop grade 2–4 neuropathy. Peripheral neuropathy was prospectively graded by National Cancer Institute (NCI) criteria. CEP72 promoter genotype (rs924607) was determined using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping. Frequency of the CEP72 T/T genotype was higher in cases (31% vs. 10%, P = 0.0221) and the incidence of vincristine-induced neuropathy (grades 2–4) was significantly higher in patients homozygous for the CEP72 T/T genotype. 75% of the 20 patients homozygous for the CEP72 T allele developed grade 2–4 neuropathy, compared to 44% of patients with CEP72 CC or CT genotype (P = 0.0221). The CEP72 polymorphism can identify adults at increased risk of vincristine-induced peripheral neuropathy.

### Genetic variants associated with vincristine-induced peripheral neuropathy in two populations of children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia [^112F6KkC]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2019). Medium credibility.

Vincristine is one of the core chemotherapy agents used in the treatment of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). However, one of the major toxicities resulting from vincristine exposure is vincristine-induced peripheral neuropathy (VIPN). When VIPN results in significant morbidity, the vincristine dose may need to be reduced, thus potentially decreasing the effectiveness of treatment. To date, there are no robust biomarkers used clinically to determine which patients will be at risk for worse neuropathy. The current study included genomewide association study (GWAS) in two independent cohorts: Pediatric Oncology Group (POG) ALL trials and a multicenter study based at Indiana University in children with ALL. A meta-analysis of the cohorts identified two single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), rs1045644 and rs7963521, as being significantly (P value threshold 0.05/4749 = 1.05E-05) associated with neuropathy. Subsequently these SNPs may be effective biomarkers of VIPN in children with ALL.

### Cannabinoids: an effective treatment for chemotherapy-induced peripheral neurotoxicity? [^113nTkeE]. Neurotherapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neurotoxicity (CIPN) is one of the most frequent side effects of the pharmacological treatment of solid and hematological tumors. Although with remarkably different severity and regional differences, CIPN can affect the vast majority of lung, breast, prostate, gastrointestinal, and germinal cancer patients, as well as subjects affected by different forms of leukemia, lymphoma and multiple myeloma, accounting for approximately 75% of all cancer patients.

Besides the impact of CIPN symptoms during chemotherapy, a significant proportion of cancer patients experience long term, or even permanent, persistence of neurotoxicity symptoms and signs, which negatively affects their working and social activities and overall quality of life. No preventive or symptomatic treatment for CIPN has been identified. The recent American Society for Clinical Oncology (ASCO) clinical practice guidelines on prevention and management of CIPN in survivors of adult cancers as well as the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO)–European Oncology Nursing Society (EONS)–European Association of Neuro-Oncology (EANO) clinical practice guidelines for diagnosis, prevention, treatment, and follow-up of chemotherapy-induced neurotoxicity provide only moderate recommendation for the use of duloxetine as a symptomatic treatment.

The spectrum of CIPN clinical features is highly variable depending on the different chemotherapeutic drugs, ranging from a nearly pure sensory neuropathy following platinum drugs (e.g. cisplatin, oxaliplatin), thalidomide or proteasome inhibitors (namely bortezomib) to sensorimotor neuropathy induced by taxanes (e.g. paclitaxel, docetaxel), eribulin, epothilones, or vinca alkaloids (remarkably, during vincristine administration autonomic failure might also occur and be dose-limiting). Neuropathic pain is frequent and may be severe in bortezomib-treated patients, while "paclitaxel associated painful syndrome" is also frequent, but less severe and rapidly disappearing, and, hours after oxaliplatin administration cold-induced paresthesias, cramps, and a spectrum of transient symptoms due to nerve hyperexcitability are nearly universal.

Vincristine-induced peripheral neuropathy-related pathophysiology.

Schematic overview of the key GWAS-significant loci across different vincristine peripheral neuropathy-related pathophysiology. a VTI1A regulates neuronal development, Golgi secretion, and extracellular transport of neurons; NRG3 plays a role in intracellular signal transduction and nervous system development; Actin provides structural support for neurons and regulates neuronal shape. b MCM3AP is implicated in axonal and demyelinating CMT neuropathy; ZFAND proteins regulate the clearance of aberrant stress granules (SGs) via the ubiquitin/proteasome system, preventing stress vulnerability in motoneurons and CMT caused by aberrant-SGs –; Neuregulin interacts with ErbB to promote myelination of peripheral axons and motor axon maturation –. c Actin filaments regulate axon growth, guidance, and active axonal transport; ARHGAP5 mediates cytoskeleton changes and promotes actin polymerization through regulating Rho GTPases; FBN2 provides mechanical and functional support to peripheral nerves and is implicated in early-onset neuropathies. d VTI1A regulates the fusion of synaptic vesicles with the presynaptic membrane via interacting with t-SNAREs complex proteins; Actinin regulates neurotransmitter release from presynaptic terminals and modulates synaptic plasticity via activating CaMKII in post-synapse neurons,–; NRG3 promotes excitatory synapse formation and plasticity, and modulates synaptic transmission through activating ErbB4; LRRTM3 induces synapse development and differentiation through interacting with pre-synapse neurexins.

Several trials sought to determine whether medications such as amitriptyline, Org 2766, gabapentin, vitamin B6, and glutamine can be used to treat or prevent vincristine-induced peripheral neuropathy –. Out of these, only gabapentin has been found to improve neuropathy symptoms in pediatric patients. However, these trials suffered from limitations such as a small sample, insufficient power, a high drop-out rate, and inconsistencies in primary outcomes, limiting the comparability of results. In addition, these trials were performed in a variety of treatment settings with various chemotherapy regimens, including different combinations of other neurotoxic medications (e.g. vinblastine, platinum derivatives, and taxanes), making the interpretation and extrapolation of the results a major challenge. As a result, despite the widespread interest and numerous clinical trials aiming to treat peripheral neuropathy, no clear standard has been determined or can be recommended at the current time.

### The natural history of vincristine-induced laryngeal paralysis in children… [^113FKYTC]. JAMA Network (2009). Excellent credibility.

Main Outcome Measures Charts and literature were reviewed for demographics, primary diagnosis, other diagnoses, and duration and method of treatment. The prevalence of VLP, locally, was also calculated. Results. Vinca alkaloids were first introduced as antineoplastic agents in early 1960. They are derived from the periwinkle plant. Vincristine has a well-established role in the treatment of hematologic malignant neoplasms and solid tumors. 1 Vinca alkaloids act as mitotic inhibitors by binding to the protein component of microtubules. Their neurotoxicity is thought to occur because of the binding with tubulin, 2, 3 where it interferes with microtubule assembly, axonal transport, and secretory functions, thereby causing primary axonal degeneration. This process has been documented by nerve biopsy and electron microscopy.

3 The most common clinical manifestations of neurologic toxicity are peripheral neuropathy, autonomic dysfunction, cranial neuropathy, and encephalopathy. Colicky abdominal pain and constipation are often among the earliest manifestations of vincristine neurotoxicity, occurring within days of drug administration and antedating paresthesia or reflex depression. 4 The first sign of peripheral neuropathy is loss of deep-tendon reflexes, which is followed by paresthesia, ataxia, foot drop, and muscle wasting. 2, 5 Cranial neuropathy is less common than autonomic or peripheral neuropathy but is associated with more morbidity. The second patient was the child with Down syndrome who developed peripheral neuropathy after restarting vincristine therapy in the form of pain involving the jaw and upper extremities, which lasted for 1 week.

The therapy was continued at half the original dosage until course completion. We did not recommend therapy in the girl with ALL after decannulation or in in the boy with Ewing sarcoma. There was no recurrence of VLP in any of our patients, and none of them developed any other cranial neuropathy. It has been reported that vincristine toxicity has a cumulative effect. Frequent and higher doses increases the toxicity. 11 All 4 children in our series were given vincristine at a dosage of 1. 5 mg/m2/wk.

### Chemotherapy-evoked painful peripheral neuropathy [^111vrSfV]. Pain Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Vincristine and paclitaxel, two of the most effective drugs in the battle against cancer, produce a dose-limiting neurotoxicity that sometimes presents as a painful peripheral neuropathy. For the first time, investigators have been able to produce these chemotherapy-evoked painful peripheral neuropathies in the laboratory rat. These new models have already begun to elucidate the causes of the neuropathic pain associated with these antineoplastic drugs, which will now make it possible to search for effective ways to prevent and treat it.

### Vincristine-induced neurotoxicity in pediatric patients with rhabdomyosarcoma: a retrospective analysis of clinical features and outcome [^115Qpzjt]. Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (2022). Medium credibility.

Vincristine is an essential component of rhabdomyosarcoma treatment. However, it can cause motor neurotoxicity, necessitating dose reductions. We retrospectively reviewed the rates and patterns of vincristine-induced motor neuropathy in children treated for rhabdomyosarcoma, and investigated effects on outcome. Fifteen of 43 patients (35%) developed motor neuropathies necessitating dose reductions, which ranged from 1.7% to 58% of planned cumulative dose. Older age was the only significant clinical risk factor. Almost half (47%) recovered during treatment with subsequent dose escalation. Most patients had complete resolution of symptoms upon follow-up. There was no discernible effect of treatment reduction on survival or relapse rates.

### Methotrexate-related central neurotoxicity: clinical characteristics, risk factors and genome-wide association study in children treated for acute lymphoblastic leukemia [^116yYFta]. Haematologica (2022). Medium credibility.

Dosing of methotrexate

MTX levels at 24, 48 or 54 hours following a first course of HD MTX did not correlate with incidence of MTX neurotoxicity (P = 0.964, P = 0.81 and P = 0.866 respectively). Incidence of delayed MTX excretion is outlined in the Online Supplementary Appendix.

There was a significantly higher incidence of MTX neurotoxicity on protocols with a lower cumulative IV MTX dose (total dose 0–2.5 g/m, n = 20 of 148, 13.5%) compared to protocols with a higher cumulative IV MTX dose (20–35 g/m, n = 69 of 863, 8.0%, P = 0.031, odds ratio [OR] 1.8, 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 1.06–3.06). This difference remained when stratified for high-risk protocols, with cumulative incidence of MTX neurotoxicity of 33% (n = 11 of 33) with lower dose IV MTX protocols compared to 9.7% (n = 13 of 134) with higher-dose MTX protocols respectively (P < 0.001).

Other potential differences, such as use of vincristine during the IV MTX phases on COG-protocols, compared to BFM-based protocols which do not use vincristine during the IV MTX phases (P = 0.792), use of vincristine during consolidation versus no vincristine (P = 0.50) or higher ageadjusted IT MTX doses for children aged ≥ 9 years, were not significantly associated with MTX neurotoxicity (P = 0.778).

Outcome following first episode of methotrexate neurotoxicity

We assessed the incidence of several clinical outcomes: including rates of CNS relapse, LFS, recurrent MTX neurotoxicity and long-term neurological outcomes in children who experienced a first episode of MTX neurotoxicity. Out of 95 patients who experienced MTX neurotoxicity, 48 (50.5%) had subsequent IT MTX permanently discontinued, 34 (35.8%) had IT MTX continued, and one patient developed MTX neurotoxicity following their last scheduled IT MTX dose. Subsequent IT management could not be determined for 12 (12.6%) cases. In patients where IT MTX was permanently discontinued, subsequent IT therapy included cytarabine alone (n = 23), cytarabine and hydrocortisone (n = 17), no further IT agents (n = 2, in maintenance and Protocol M respectively), and in six patients the alternative IT regime was unknown.

### Identifying systems failures in the pathway to a catastrophic event: an analysis of national incident report data relating to vinca alkaloids [^114h7vt1]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2014). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The first reports of deaths from the administration of intravenous vincristine via the incorrect route started to appear in the medical literature in the late 1960s. Despite an awareness of the problems associated with vincristine and other vinca alkaloids for over 45 years, serious and sometimes fatal errors associated with their use still occur. Such events remain very rare but have devastating and tragic consequences for the people concerned (often children) and their families.

Investigations of such incidents have shown them to be classic systems failures and thus amenable to prevention. Analyses have found vulnerabilities at every stage of the process, including inadequate labelling, ambiguous procedures, lack of standardisation across units and other hazards. Newer, unexpected failures at the manufacturing stage have also been reported. In the absence of a long sought-after failsafe involving a new spinal injection connecting system, the safety of patients receiving intravenous vinca alkaloids as part of cytotoxic chemotherapy continues to depend on compliance with guidelines and protocols.

The challenge of eliminating these tragic events has inspired policy statements from, among others, the North American Institute of Safe Medication Practices, the UK Government, the Australian Council for Safety and Quality in Health Care, the Ministry of Health in Hong Kong and WHO. In the UKand other countries, guidance and protocols have been issued that specify the exact processes required for the administration of intravenous vincristine (and other vinca alkaloids) in patients who are also receiving intrathecal chemotherapy. These policy statements and resulting changes in procedure have done much to reduce the risks of the maladministration of vinca alkaloids. However, given that the adverse outcome is so rare, there is no easy way of identifying any remaining vulnerabilities, or monitoring the current risk to patients.

In the UK, to the best of our knowledge, there have been no deaths or serious incidents since 2001. The very success of current policies and procedures makes the identification of any remaining vulnerabilities much more challenging. In Amalberti's telling phrase, it is one of the 'paradoxes of ultra-safe systems'; the safer a system becomes, the less safety information is available to monitor current safety or to guide future safety interventions. The deaths from vincristine, while dreadful, led to an opportunity to learn and improve. The challenge is now to monitor and further improve safety in the absence of evidence of harm.

### Characterising vincristine-induced peripheral neuropathy in adults: symptom development and long-term persistent outcomes [^117MEr5m]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

Adult and paediatric VIPN

In the paediatric cohort, VIPN typically presents as motor predominant. However, sensory neuropathy is difficulty to evaluate in young children, as they may have difficulty in communicating their experiences of sensory symptoms such as 'numbness and tingling'. On the other hand, motor neuropathy is easier to clinically detect, with patients often being visibly weaker, and less active. Conversely in adults, 'numbness and tingling' is a unique abnormal sensation that patients can often easily recognise and report, whereas motor neuropathy symptoms including weakness and cramping are often difficult to attribute solely to treatment side-effects as opposed to cancer or age-related deconditioning.

Electrophysiological examinations in paediatric VIPN have also demonstrated greater motor compared to sensory nerve involvement suggesting the motor-predominant neuropathy may not purely be due to symptom communication difficulties, or due to myopathy. While specific reasons behind this difference remains unknown, the difference in phenotypes may be related to age-dependent molecular changes in axonal function which may affect repair or regeneration pathways. Experimental models of traumatic injury or inherited neuropathy have also demonstrated differences in phenotypic expression of symptoms based on age, highlighting that age-dependent changes in axonal function may influence VIPN presentation between adults and children. In the present adult study, there were reductions in both motor and sensory amplitudes by end of treatment; however, patients reporting persisting symptoms did not have lower amplitudes than patients without neuropathy. This may be related to inter-individual variability in baseline amplitudes. Further, electrophysiological, clinical and patient reported approaches to neuropathy assessment have been demonstrated to not directly conform, suggesting each outcome measure alone is not sufficient to entirely capture the severity, impact and experience of neuropathy. Discrepancies between clinical examination and neurophysiological studies are common and potentially reflect the different sensitivity of techniques to identify dysfunction.

### American Society of Hematology 2019 guidelines for immune thrombocytopenia [^112C2xJk]. Blood Advances (2019). High credibility.

Vinca alkaloids in immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) — mechanism, efficacy, toxicities, and special administration: Their primary mechanism in ITP is probably their ability to inhibit macrophage function and thus reduce platelet loss by splenic histiocytes; reported response at 1 month can be as low as 18%, with durable response ranging from 0% to 42%. Almost all patients experience side effects, including vincristine neuropathy (27.8%) and constipation (3.5%); it has been reported that these adverse effects are reduced when vinca alkaloids are given by a prolonged infusion or loaded into platelets, and infusion of vinca-loaded platelets into ITP patients targets macrophages and reduces platelet phagocytosis. Vinca alkaloids are contraindicated during pregnancy and lactation.

### Vinorelbine as substitute for vincristine in patients with diffuse large B cell lymphoma and vincristine-induced neuropathy [^117MCzCh]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2021). Medium credibility.

Here, we present a large "real world" cohort of patients with de novo DLBCL treated with R-CHOP in 21-day cycles showing a VIPN rate of 32% (199/605) which is in agreement with published large prospective trials. We provide for the first time evidence of a neurologic benefit following substitution instead of dose reduction of vincristine. This benefit was documented by two different neuropathy measures, the easily assessable NCI-CTCAE score and the more accurate and reliable cTNS, which correlated significantly with each other. Furthermore, our results suggest an improvement of survival outcomes after switching to Vino-R-CAP. One might speculate that patients who were treated with vinorelbine during first-line treatment received an additional cytostatic substance targeting remaining vincristine-resistant lymphoma cells. It has been established that vinorelbine is an effective salvage agent in relapsed or refractory aggressive NHL. Blazarotti et al. showed overall response rates of 46% for vinorelbine as single agent in heavily pre-treated lymphoma patients. Moreover, vinorelbine has been used in different salvage regimens for relapsed or refractory DLBCL as combination partner because it has no-cross resistance properties with other vinca alkaloids. However, these findings are preliminary and can only be interpreted as hypothesis generating.

The main limitation of our study is its retrospective nature; however, the patient cohort is characterized by very stringent inclusion criteria and long follow-up providing a 20-year "real world" experience. Although it has to be proven in a randomized controlled trial, based on our robust retrospective data, we can conclude that switching to Vino-R-CAP is safe and more effective than reducing vincristine dose when DLBCL patients develop neuropathy during treatment with R-CHOP.

### Pyridoxine and pyridostigmine treatment in vincristine-induced neuropathy [^113Ppwnb]. Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (2007). Low credibility.

Vincristine is a commonly used antineoplastic drug and frequently causes neurotoxicity. Here the authors report a 4-year-old boy with acute lymphoblastic leukemia in whom vincristine-induced peripheral and cranial neuropathy developed during remission induction therapy. The patient seemed to benefit from pyridoxine and pyridostigmine therapy greatly and this therapy is recommended in patients with severe vincristine-induced neuropathy.

Vincristine

Vincristine belongs to the vinca alkaloid compounds and is incorporated in several polychemotherapy oncology protocols. Its most prevalent use for the treatment of primary brain tumors is in combination with procarbazine and lomustine in the PCV regimen. Vincristine has a very poor oral bioavailability and is thus administered intravenously. It shows poor blood brain barrier penetration and might thus only reach contrast-enhancing tumor areas in the CNS (with a leaky blood–brain barrier). The main metabolism occurs in the liver via the cytochrome enzyme system, particularly CYP3A4 and CYP3A5. Half time is around 80–85 hours, yet, interpatient variability in metabolism as well as drug–drug interactions need to be considered.

Vincristine alone is rarely myelosuppressive. Of note, its microtubulin target is also a critical component of nerve fiber axons. Thus, the main treatment-induced clinical complications are axonopathies leading to axonal sensorimotor neuropathies of large and small nerve fibers with symptoms like numbness, tingling, neuropathic pain, and hyporeflexia. Autonomic neuropathy may manifest with constipation. Risk factors for the development of vincristine-induced neuropathies include preexisting hereditary neuropathies, and thus a corresponding family history should be considered as a contraindication for vincristine treatment. Even though preexisting vitamin deficiencies are associated with neurotoxicity, neither monitoring nor preventive vitamin supplementations are appropriate. Since there are no standardized recommendations how to treat vincristine-induced polyneuropathy, early recognition and cessation of vincristine exposure are essential. Medications with duloxetine, venlafaxine, or baclofen might be helpful in patients with painful neuropathy.

### Characterising vincristine-induced peripheral neuropathy in adults: symptom development and long-term persistent outcomes [^116au8hH]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

Limitations

This study was an observational natural history investigation of VIPN, with a limited sample size. Due to the nature of longitudinal research, not all prospective patients were able to attend all testing timepoints, and the authors acknowledge this as a limitation to the study. Future studies should conduct a priori power analyses to determine the sample sizes needed to detect change in neuropathy signs and symptoms. This will also reduce chances Type 1 errors, which may have occurred in this present study. Furthermore, longer-term follow-ups may provide greater insight in VIPN recovery as well as patterns of adaptation in chronic VIPN. NCS were only performed on the lower limbs in the present study, and future studies should also investigate neurophysiological changes in the upper limbs. Assessment of autonomic neuropathy was brief in this study, and future studies should incorporate more rigorous outcome measures, including objective markers of autonomic neuropathy to detail the severity and impact of autonomic neuropathy. As some patients were recruited cross-sectionally, the prevalence of VIPN in this cohort needs to be considered in this context as it may be higher than a purely prospective study. Cross-sectional participants were also recruited from a range of time since vincristine treatment, and vincristine regimens. While this was intentional in order to examine a representative sample of chronic VIPN presentation, this has resulted in a heterogenous participant sample. Other chemotherapies taken concurrently with vincristine were not controlled for; however, it is unlikely that this would have affected the profile of VIPN. In order to more fully identify risk factors for VIPN development such as cumulative dose, larger prospective studies are necessary. A number of genetic polymorphisms have been associated with VIPN, particularly in children. These should be interrogated in prospective series utilising comprehensive neuropathy assessment protocols in order to better guide identification of patients at risk of long-term sequelae.

### P-glycoprotein and mrp1 collectively protect the bone marrow from vincristine-induced toxicity in vivo [^115DrJjo]. British Journal of Cancer (2003). Low credibility.

The MTD in Mdr1ab/Mrp1 TKO mice was clearly lower at 0.5 mg kg −1, but similar macroscopic signs of toxicity were observed. At a dose of 1 mg kg −1, two out of four animals had to be killed (at days 4 and 5) because their body weight dropped by more than 20%, whereas the two others survived. These results indicate that there is a moderate increase in vincristine toxicity in animals lacking both these drug-transporting proteins.

Toxic effects of vincristine in wild-type and Mdr1ab/Mrp1 TKO mice were assessed by full necropsy of the animals 2 days after they received vincristine at their respective MTD. In Mdr1ab/Mrp1 TKO mice receiving 0.5 mg kg −1 toxicities manifested by arrested mitoses were found in the intestines, skin, bone marrow, the adrenal medulla and in the bases of the incisors. No evidence for central nervous toxicity or liver toxicity was observed. In wild-type mice receiving a dose of 2 mg kg −1, the incisors were affected and a moderate depletion of the bone marrow was seen, but no signs of toxicity were found in any of the other tissues, except for some mild vacuolisation of spinal ganglion neurons.

### Approaches to measure paediatric chemotherapy-induced peripheral neurotoxicity: a systematic review [^116rPryj]. The Lancet: Haematology (2020). High credibility.

In children who receive neurotoxic chemotherapy, peripheral neurotoxicity occurs frequently, necessitates dose reduction or treatment cessation, and affects function and long-term quality of life. No treatments exist for peripheral neurotoxicity and few assessment measures are specific to children. We did a systematic review to analyse the published literature concerning the evaluation of assessment measures for paediatric chemotherapy-induced peripheral neurotoxicity. We searched PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and Embase on Nov 7–8, 2018; of 1409 articles, seven met the inclusion criteria. A total of 335 children (excluding ten healthy controls) were enrolled in the seven studies and the sample sizes ranged from 17 to 86 individuals. 276 (82%) of the 335 children were actively undergoing chemotherapy treatment. Most studies did not comprehensively evaluate the psychometric properties of assessment measures for chemotherapy-induced peripheral neurotoxicity. By use of a narrative analysis that combined approaches from the Joanna Briggs Institute (Adelaide, SA, Australia) and the quality of diagnostic accuracy studies assessment method (known as QUADAS), only one study was deemed high quality. We identified two variants of the Total Neuropathy Score, two grading scales, two semi-objective tests, one patient-reported outcome, and several mobility measures. The National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events and the Balis grading scales showed lower sensitivity and specificity than the items of the Total Neuropathy Score. Although there is insufficient evidence to support the use of most approaches to assess chemotherapy-induced peripheral neurotoxicity in children, two variants of the Total Neuropathy Score, the pediatric-modified Total Neuropathy Score and the Total Neuropathy Score-pediatric vincristine, are promising but require further testing. Other approaches are less sensitive or less feasible. A patient-reported outcome measure for chemotherapy-induced peripheral neurotoxicity in children is needed.

### Characterising vincristine-induced peripheral neuropathy in adults: symptom development and long-term persistent outcomes [^1111VQHg]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Decades following the introduction of vincristine as treatment for haematological malignancies, vincristine-induced peripheral neuropathy (VIPN) remains a pervasive, untreatable side-effect. However there remains a gap in understanding the characteristics of VIPN in adults. This study presents a comprehensive phenotyping of VIPN.

Methods

Adult patients (n = 57; age = 59.8 ± 14.6) were assessed cross-sectionally following completion of vincristine (months post treatment = 16.3 ± 15.6, cumulative dose = 7.6 ± 4.4), with a subset of 20 patients assessed prospectively during treatment. Patient reported measures (EORTC-QLQ-CIPN20, R-ODS) were used to profile symptoms and disability. Neurological assessment was undertaken using the Total Neuropathy Score and nerve conduction studies. Sensory threshold and fine motor tasks were also undertaken. Comparisons of data between timepoints were calculated using paired-sample t tests or Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank test. Comparisons between outcome measures were calculated with independent sample t tests or Mann–Whitney U tests for non-parametric data.

Results

The majority of patients developed VIPN by mid-treatment (77.8%, 7.0 ± 3.3 weeks post baseline) with the prevalence remaining stable by end-of-treatment (75%, 8.1 ± 1.7 weeks post mid-treatment). By 3 months post-completion, 50% of patients still reported VIPN although there were significant improvements on neurological grading and functional assessment (P < 0.05). VIPN presented with sensorimotor involvement in upper and lower limbs and was associated with decreased sensory and motor nerve amplitudes, reduced fine-motor function and increased disability.

Conclusion

VIPN in adults presents as a sensorimotor, upper- and lower-limb neuropathy that significantly impacts disability and function. Neuropathy recovery occurs in a proportion of patients; however, VIPN symptoms may persist and continue to affect long-term quality of life.

### Acute central nervous system toxicity during treatment of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia: phenotypes, risk factors and genotypes [^116Lzchg]. Haematologica (2022). Medium credibility.

The incidence of CNS toxicities in children with ALL has previously been found to vary between 3.6% and 18.4%.5, This wide spectrum of incidences mirrors different study designs, treatment protocols, and potential differences in documentation and classification of CNS toxicities; for example, in the Australian cohort with diverse CNS toxicities cases of sinus venous thrombosis were not included because they were examined in a separate study (Tables 1 and 2).5,23–26,28, The chemotherapeutic agents most often associated with CNS toxicity in ALL are methotrexate, glucocorticosteroids, vincristine, asparaginase, and cytarabine. The NOPHO ALL2008 protocol includes intensive treatment with vincristine, high-dose methotrexate and asparaginase, which might have contributed to a higher incidence of CNS toxicity compared to that in patients treated with other protocols.22, In our study the incidence of PRES, which was reported separately, was high whereas methotrexate-re-lated stroke-like syndrome was rare, contrasting with the findings in the Australian cohort in which the incidence of methotrexate-related stroke-like syndrome was clearly higher (Tables 1 and 2). Methotrexate-related CNS toxicity including stroke-like syndrome is a well-known entity but it is possible that mild cases may have been undetected and not registered as CNS toxicity or they might have been registered as isolated seizures without further evaluation with neuroimaging. Patients with CNS leukemia were excluded from some studies on the occurrence of CNS toxicities. Here, we included patients with CNS leukemia to explore whether CNS involvement at diagnosis was associated with a higher risk of CNS toxicity. Unlike in a recent study of Finnish children with ALL, leukemic involvement of the CNS was not an independent risk factor for CNS toxicity in our cohort or the Australian cohort studying methotrexate-related CNS toxicity.

### Pharmacogenomics of vincristine-induced peripheral neuropathy implicates pharmacokinetic and inherited neuropathy genes [^117WxpAV]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2019). Medium credibility.

Vincristine is an antineoplastic agent that is used to treat various cancers. This includes the most common pediatric form, acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), a cancer that has survival rates that have increased to over 90% in certain world regions in recent decades. 1, 2 Vincristine‐induced neurotoxicity is a common and severe adverse drug reaction (ADR) that can occur in over 50% of vincristine‐treated patients. 3, 4, 5 This potentially life‐threatening and debilitating toxicity includes vincristine‐induced peripheral neuropathy (VIPN), which can cause loss of motor function, abnormal sensation, and pain. 6 This reaction severely affects the quality of life of patients, as well as influences the dosing and clinical utility of the drug. 7 Genetic causes are thought to play an important role in this ADR because VIPN‐susceptibility varies across ancestries 8 and the trait has been shown to be heritable in model organisms. 9

Pharmacogenomics provide an attractive approach to mitigate VIPN – predictive testing would allow patients to be stratified according to risk before treatment, allowing for either increased monitoring or dose changes in at‐risk patients. Furthermore, the identification of genetic risk factors may provide novel insights into the mechanisms underlying variability in VIPN‐susceptibility. Recently, a genome‐wide association study (GWAS) in two cohorts reported that variation linked to the microtubule‐organizing centrosomal protein, CEP72, significantly contributes to the risk of VIPN in pediatric ALL. 10 This is in line with the mechanism of action of vincristine, which perturbs mitosis by interfering with microtubule formation. 7, 11 An initial replication study failed to detect a significant association between this CEP72 risk genotype and VIPN, 12 which may have been driven by differences in the therapy stage during which VIPN was assessed (i.e. continuation vs. induction). 13 Subsequently, members of the research group involved in the discovery of the CEP72 ‐VIPN association replicated this finding in a clinical trial of adult patients with ALL, 14 but confirmation in an independent pediatric cohort is still warranted.

We, therefore, assessed the relationship between VIPN and CEP72 genotype in a retrospective cohort of pediatric patients with ALL. This was followed by an exploratory analysis of pharmacogenomic variants from absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) genes and a meta‐analysis of ADME genetic variants that overlapped variants from the previous GWAS. 10 Studies such as these provide essential corroboratory clinical evidence for previously identified drug safety biomarkers, while also identifying additional variants for future study.

### High-dose methotrexate-based regimens with or without vincristine for the treatment of primary central nervous system lymphoma [^112WGPFs]. Neuro-Oncology Advances (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) is a rare malignancy with few treatment options. One regimen used for induction is rituximab, high-dose methotrexate (HD-MTX), procarbazine, and vincristine (R-MPV). A common institutional practice is removing vincristine (VCR) from this regimen due to its poor CNS penetration and associated toxicities. The aim of this study was to evaluate how the omission of VCR from HD-MTX-based induction impacted clinical outcomes.

Methods

In a retrospective review, patients with PCNSL who received HD-MTX-based induction therapy between January 1, 2010 and May 31, 2018 were evaluated. Patients were stratified according to treatment into 2 groups, VCR-containing therapy versus no VCR. The primary endpoint was complete response (CR) rate following the completion of induction chemotherapy. Secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and adverse event rate.

Results

Twenty-nine patients were included: 16 patients in the VCR group and 13 in the non-VCR group. A CR was achieved in 7 (44%) and 5 (38%) (odds ratio [OR] = 1.24; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.28–5.53) patients, respectively. Median OS was 85.3 (95% CI: 20.2–85.3) versus 67.1 months (95% CI: 10.5-NR) and median PFS was 60.7 (95% CI: 9.4-NR) versus 23.7 months (95% CI: 4.7-NR) in the VCR group versus non-VCR group, respectively. The incidence of any grade peripheral neuropathy was higher in the VCR group.

Conclusions

CR rate, OS, and PFS were similar between groups regardless of VCR inclusion. Adverse events were higher in the VCR group. Larger studies are required to further evaluate the efficacy of VCR in PCNSL induction regimens.

### Genomic variations associated with risk and protection against vincristine-induced peripheral neuropathy in pediatric cancer patients [^111NL8RK]. NPJ Genomic Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Of note, while the current GWAS study identified 13 genetic variants strongly associated with vincristine-induced peripheral neuropathy risk (Table 2), the analysis did not replicate previously identified variants, namely the promoter variation (rs924607) in the centrosomal Protein 72 (CEP72) gene, which was first identified by Diouf et al. where an association was observed in cases of neuropathy grade 2–4 during the continuation phase of chemotherapy treatment. This significant association was evident only in patients after prolonged vincristine treatment (20–40 doses over 1–2 years) and was not replicated by the same research group (Diouf et al.) and other studies when investigating neuropathy risk during the induction phase. This suggests the effect of CEP72 is particularly relevant to longer-term therapy. In the current study, the time-to-neuropathy analysis showed that 60.2% of vincristine-induced neuropathy cases reported symptoms early (i.e. within the first month of chemotherapy), and 90% developed neuropathy prior to the completion of seven months of cancer treatment. This difference in neuropathy onset can explain the non-significant association of CEP72 rs924607 observed in our study and suggests potential etiological differences in neuropathy between induction and continuation phases of treatment. The lack of replication of previously identified genetic markers highlights the complexity of vincristine-induced neuropathy and underscores the importance of considering the phenotypic variability in genomic studies when moving forward with results validation.

To determine if our findings are relevant to the adult population, a dedicated study in adults is needed. The detection and diagnosis, as well as incidence and severity of vincristine-induced peripheral neuropathy, may differ between pediatric and adult populations due to differences in physiology, comorbidities, and the use of concomitant medications. The incidence of neuropathy in pediatric patients can be as high as 78%, whereas in adults, it ranges from 30–50%. Such difference in the incidence potentially suggests that different genetic and biological factors may influence neuropathy risk between children and adults. While predictive pharmacogenetic biomarkers remain constant across the lifespan, their expression and impact can differ significantly between children and adults. In addition, the dynamic developmental changes such as drug-metabolizing enzymes and organ function over time necessitate dedicated research to optimize drug therapy in children and adult populations. Unlike adults, children typically have fewer comorbidities and take fewer concomitant medications, which can mask genetic predictors of adverse drug reactions. This highlights the necessity for independent pharmacogenomic studies in children and adults to identify genetic predictors of vincristine-induced neuropathy.

### CHOD / BVAM chemotherapy and whole-brain radiotherapy for newly diagnosed primary central nervous system lymphoma [^116qfPDz]. International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology, Physics (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose

To assess the efficacy and toxicity of chemotherapy consisting of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin (Adriamycin), vincristine, and dexamethasone (CHOD) plus bis-chloronitrosourea (BCNU), cytosine arabinoside, and methotrexate (BVAM) followed by whole-brain irradiation (WBRT) for patients with primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL).

Methods and Materials

Patients 70 years old and younger with newly diagnosed, biopsy-proven PCNSL received one cycle of CHOD followed by two cycles of BVAM. Patients then received WBRT, 30.6 Gy, if a complete response was evoked, or 50.4 Gy if the response was less than complete; both doses were given in 1.8-Gy daily fractions. The primary efficacy endpoint was 1-year survival.

Results

Thirty-six patients (19 men, 17 women) enrolled between 1995 and 2000. Median age was 60.5 years (range, 34 to 69 years). Thirty (83%) patients had baseline Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance scores of 0 to 1. All 36 patients were eligible for survival and response evaluations. Median time to progression was 12.3 months, and median survival was 18.5 months. The percentages of patients alive at 1, 2, and 3 years were 64%, 36%, and 33%, respectively. The best response was complete response in 10 patients and immediate progression in 7 patients. Ten (28%) patients had at least one grade 3 or higher neurologic toxicity.

Conclusions

This regimen did improve the survival of PCNSL patients but also caused substantial toxicity. The improvement in survival is less than that reported with high-dose methotrexate-based therapies.

### Effect of race on vincristine-associated neurotoxicity in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients [^112c5q1s]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2008). Low credibility.

Background

This report examines the association between race and vincristine-associated neurotoxicity in pediatric patients with precursor B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (preB ALL). Given that in vitro vincristine is metabolized more efficiently by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A5 than by CYP3A4 and that 70% African-Americans (vs. 20% of Caucasians) express CYP3A5, one may hypothesize that African-Americans metabolize vincristine more efficiently resulting in lower vincristine exposure and associated-toxicity.

Procedure

A retrospective analysis of vincristine-related side effects in pediatric patients treated for preB ALL was performed. Data were compared between Caucasians (n = 92) and African-Americans (n = 21) to examine the relationship between race and vincristine-associated neurotoxicity thus using race as a surrogate for CYP3A5 genotype. Race, age, gender, disease subtype, highest grade of vincristine-associated neurotoxicity (per NIH Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 3.0), number of omitted and reduced vincristine doses, cumulative vincristine dose, and disease outcome were captured.

Results

34.8% of Caucasians experienced symptoms consistent with vincristine-related neurotoxicity compared to 4.8% of African-Americans (P = 0.007). The average grade of neurotoxicity for Caucasians was 2.72 versus grade 1 neurotoxicity in the African-American (P < 0.0001). Four percent of total doses administered to Caucasian patients were reduced due to vincristine-related neurotoxicity compared to 0.1% given to African-Americans (P < 0.0001). 1.2% of all protocol-indicated doses for Caucasians were held due to severe vincristine-associated toxicity compared to 0.1% of doses for African-Americans (P < 0.01).

Conclusions

The data support the hypothesis pharmacogenetic polymorphisms in CYP3A5 expression contribute to variability in vincristine metabolism and neurotoxicity.

### Characterising vincristine-induced peripheral neuropathy in adults: symptom development and long-term persistent outcomes [^1172Lu9n]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

Impact of VIPN

While the present study determined that 78% of patients developed VIPN, previous studies have suggested a large range of reported prevalence, from 44 to 92%, across studies. This most likely reflects the range of methods utilised for assessing neuropathy, with the most commonly used measure in large-scale clinical trials, NCI-CTCAE, known to have low inter-rater reliability. Accordingly in the present study, VIPN assessment included patient symptom report as patient reported measures are becoming increasingly recognised as a valuable tool to capture neuropathy information. Another important consideration that may affect reported VIPN prevalence is that the NCI-CTCAE sensory neuropathy subscale is most commonly used in clinical trials, which does not incorporate motor neuropathy symptoms, which is also a critically important characteristic of VIPN.

At mid-treatment, VIPN symptoms had reached the threshold of clinical significance (score increase of > 4.26 on the CIPN20). VIPN presented as motor and sensory neuropathy, affecting upper and lower limbs. Although prior studies investigating VIPN phenotypes are limited, early studies suggested VIPN to be predominantly sensory, while others have demonstrated motor involvement is also significant on clinical and electrophysiological examination. This significant motor neuropathy development is characteristic of vincristine neurotoxicity. Other neurotoxic agents including taxanes, platinums, bortezomib and thalidomide are typically associated with only minor motor neuropathic symptoms. Autonomic symptoms were more common in this current cohort compared to prior studies (30–39% versus 19%,), and this is likely due to the varying methods of assessing autonomic neuropathy. While the present study utilised the autonomic items of the EORTC-QLQ-CIPN20, prior studies have highlighted limitations to this autonomic subscale. Future studies should assess autonomic symptoms in vincristine-treated patients more directly to investigate the burden of autonomic nerve damage following vincristine.

### Outcomes of Burkitt lymphoma with central nervous system involvement: evidence from a large multicenter cohort study [^115ySPFo]. Haematologica (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Central nervous system (CNS) involvement is a serious complication of Burkitt lymphoma (BL), with an incidence ranging from 5% to 40%. Most first-line regimens employ dedicated CNS-directed strategies which typically include intrathecal and systemic chemotherapy capable of penetrating the blood-brain barrier. The need for multiple intrathecal injections and potential severe toxicities of high-dose methotrexate (HDMTX) pose challenges to effective CNSdirected therapy, requiring expertise from the clinician and strict adherence by the patient. It is uncertain whether the application and outcomes of CNS-directed treatments in routine clinical practice correspond to those in clinical trials.

Short-cycle, dose-intensive immunochemotherapy regimens achieve progression-free survival (PFS) rates of 70–80% in BL. Adverse effects associated with high-intensity regimens have limited the use of such regimens among the elderly or patients positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), leading to interest in less aggressive options. The DA-EPOCH-R regimen (dose-adjusted etoposide, prednisone, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and rituximab) has demonstrated excellent survival and relatively low toxicity in single-arm trials, indicating that treatment for BL can be de-escalated without apparent loss of efficacy. Whereas DA-EPOCH-R involves the same or larger numbers of intrathecal chemotherapy administrations as those in common high-intensity regimens, it notably lacks classical CNS-penetrant systemic agents (HDMTX, cytarabine, ifosfamide) used for prophylaxis against CNS disease.DA-EPOCH-R requires strict CNS staging procedures (using flow cytometry of the cerebrospinal fluid [CSF] and brain imaging) and specific protocols for prophylactic or therapeutic intrathecal therapy to control the CNS invasion. Although the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines recommend DA-EPOCH-R as a first-line option for BL along with R-CODOX-M/IVAC (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and HDMTX, alternating with ifosfamide, etoposide, and cytarabine) and RhyperCVAD/ MA (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone alternating with HDMTX/cytarabine), there are limited data about the efficacy of DA-EPOCH-R in individuals with CNS involvement. The guidelines point out that high-risk patients presenting with symptomatic CNS disease should start treatment with the portion of systemic therapy that contains CNS-penetrating drugs, and that patients with parenchymal brain involvement were not included in the clinical trials of DA-EPOCH-R.

### Dose-related vincristine-induced peripheral neuropathy with unexpected off-therapy worsening [^112s4uMz]. Neurology (2005). Low credibility.

This study describes the natural course of vincristine-induced peripheral neuropathy in patients with lymphoma (n = 114) receiving vincristine in two different dose intensities. Neuropathic changes were observed in both dose intensity groups, but the higher dose intensity group reported significantly more symptoms during therapy, whereas neurologic signs were significantly more prominent after a cumulative dose of 12 mg vincristine. Furthermore, off-therapy worsening of symptoms (24%) and signs (30%) occurred unexpectedly.

### Fluconazole [^117JiYYC]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Vinca alkaloids: Although not studied, fluconazole may increase the plasma levels of the vinca alkaloids (e.g., vincristine and vinblastine) and lead to neurotoxicity, which is possibly due to an inhibitory effect on CYP3A4.

Vitamin A: Based on a case report in one patient receiving combination therapy with all-trans-retinoid acid (an acid form of vitamin A) and fluconazole, central nervous system (CNS) related undesirable effects have developed in the form of pseudotumor cerebri, which disappeared after discontinuation of fluconazole treatment. This combination may be used but the incidence of CNS related undesirable effects should be borne in mind.

Voriconazole: Avoid concomitant administration of voriconazole and fluconazole. Monitoring for adverse events and toxicity related to voriconazole is recommended; especially, if voriconazole is started within 24 h after the last dose of fluconazole. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Drug Interaction Studies .)

Zidovudine: Fluconazole increases the Cmaxand AUC of zidovudine by 84% and 74%, respectively, due to an approximately 45% decrease in oral zidovudine clearance. The half-life of zidovudine was likewise prolonged by approximately 128% following combination therapy with fluconazole. Patients receiving this combination should be monitored for the development of zidovudine-related adverse reactions. Dosage reduction of zidovudine may be considered.

Physicians should be aware that interaction studies with medications other than those listed in the CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY section have not been conducted, but such interactions may occur.

### Effective and safe tumor inhibition using vinblastine in medulloblastoma [^1131XVn8]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2019). Medium credibility.

Most medulloblastoma protocols worldwide include vincristine during radiation and chemotherapy. A significant dose-limiting toxicity is peripheral neuropathy; however, there is a paucity of data to support the view that omission of vincristine does not impact survival. Herein we report two adolescent patients with Group 4 and SHH medulloblastoma, where vinblastine successfully replaced vincristine with resolution of their peripheral neuropathy. We furthermore show vinblastine is highly active in vitro and demonstrates equivalent antitumoral activity compared to vincristine. Substitution of vincristine with vinblastine in future studies should be considered for all patients with medulloblastoma, particularly those with hereditary neuropathy, severe vincristine toxicity, and adults.

### Identifying systems failures in the pathway to a catastrophic event: an analysis of national incident report data relating to vinca alkaloids [^116NLbEo]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2014). Medium credibility.

Implications for practice

To be able to anticipate risks in the absence of harm is the hallmark of a resilient system. It points to a more proactive approach to safety in healthcare which, in turn, relies on the integration and analysis of diverse sources of safety information. The original report which provided the foundation for patient safety in the UK NHS was called An Organisation with a Memory, precisely because it sought to provide a means of learning from incidents across the entire system. Isolated tragedies occurred constantly but, because no connections were made, no collective action was taken. When systems become safer, this challenge is even greater. How can we identify small threats to patients across a system as large as the NHS? The true value of large-scale reporting systems is not in the accumulation of vast numbers of reports but in the identification of rare or unusual events scattered across the wider system which might otherwise escape notice and put patients at risk. We would therefore recommend that consideration be given to how incident reporting systems can best be used to identify risks of the type identified here. Other high-risk incidents, such as those relating to concentrated potassium chloride, could also be studied in this way. At present, requests for data can be made to NHS England, the body responsible for commissioning healthcare for people living in England. Such requests are currently granted to bona fide organisations on a case-by-case basis. However, making properly anonymised incident report data more readily available to researchers, professional bodies, clinicians and patient representatives would provide further opportunities for learning.

We have also identified specific risks which appear to remain, concerning the separation of intravenous and intrathecal chemotherapy in time and space, and highlighted some areas where further action may be needed, such as in the area of intrathecal antibiotics.

Of concern is that some incident reports were lacking detail and did not give a full account of the nature of the hazard. Encouraging more comprehensive narratives when reporting is as important, arguably more so, than increasing reporting rates.

### Genomic variations associated with risk and protection against vincristine-induced peripheral neuropathy in pediatric cancer patients [^114kafWN]. NPJ Genomic Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Vincristine is one of the most widely used chemotherapeutic agents for the treatment of pediatric cancers, including leukemias, lymphomas, neuroblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, Wilm's tumor, and brain tumors –. Despite its high efficacy, up to 78% of patients receiving vincristine develop clinically significant vincristine-induced peripheral neuropathy –. The symptoms are characterized by progressive sensory, motor, and autonomic nerve dysfunctions (e.g. paresthesia, impaired motor skills, loss of deep tendon reflexes, and altered gait). Such symptoms are one of the main reasons for interruption or discontinuation of vincristine treatment, which can lead to an overall loss of therapeutic efficacy and an increased relapse risk, and consequently affects patients' survival and quality of life during and after cancer therapy.

The risk of developing vincristine-induced peripheral neuropathy is influenced by several factors, including patient-related and treatment-related factors. Age, sex, and ancestry represent the three patient-related factors that impact the risk of vincristine neuropathy, while treatment-related risk factors include vincristine cumulative dose and concomitant use of medications such as nifedipine, clarithromycin and anti-fungal azoles (e.g. fluconazole, ketoconazole, posaconazole, itraconazole, and voriconazole) –.

### Vinorelbine as substitute for vincristine in patients with diffuse large B cell lymphoma and vincristine-induced neuropathy [^115DhRSW]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) in adults accounting for more than 30% of all NHL cases. Vincristine, a microtubule assembly inhibitor, has become an integral component of today's treatment of DLBCL since its discovery as an active agent against lymphoma. A combination of vincristine with cyclophosphamide, hydroxydaunorubicin, prednisone, and the monoclonal antibody rituximab (R-CHOP) administered in 21-day intervals is the standard of care and results in 5-year overall survival (OS) rates of up to 87% depending on risk factors. However, all clinical trials investigating the addition of novel agents to the R-CHOP backbone as first-line treatment failed to show improvement of OS so far.

Vincristine-induced peripheral neuropathy (VIPN), which is commonly a sensorimotor neuropathy, remains a major complication of lymphoma patients treated with R-CHOP. VIPN can be observed in 20–40% of DLBCL patients leading to an increase in morbidity and a decrease in quality of life. However, the clinical features and symptoms are variable and range from mild neurologic signs like numbness, which may disappear with discontinuation of vincristine, to severe permanent neurological long-term sequela such as gross and fine motoric deficits, e.g. impaired handwriting.

The key mechanism of vinca-alkaloid action and induction of neuropathy is inhibition of microtubule polymerization but not all vinca-alkaloids cause the same rate and intensity of chemotherapy-induced neuropathy. Vincristine is the most neurotoxic vinca-alkaloid resulting in peripheral neuropathy of any grade in 18 to 70% of adult patients. On the contrary, the vinca-alkaloid vinorelbine is rarely associated with peripheral neuropathy occurring in only about 4% of patients.

Dose reduction or discontinuation of vincristine has been commonly used to ameliorate VIPN in R-CHOP-treated DLBCL patients, although this practice is likely associated with impaired treatment outcomes and higher lymphoma-related mortality. Nevertheless, there is a lack of studies focusing explicitly on VIPN and the consequences of vincristine dose reductions. In this cohort study, we aimed to delineate the role of vinorelbine as a replacement for vincristine in R-CHOP after onset of peripheral neuropathy in the treatment of de novo DLBCL.

### Axonal degeneration in chemotherapy-induced peripheral neurotoxicity: clinical and experimental evidence [^113FEnaJ]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2023). Medium credibility.

Several chemotherapy classes disrupt microtubule functioning, thus blocking cancer cells in metaphase and leading to cell death: taxanes (eg, paclitaxel, docetaxel, cabazitaxel), epothilones (eg, ixabepilone), eribulin and vinca alkaloids. Moreover, it is likely that the neurotoxicity of vedotins is due to their strong antitubulin activity, allowing even small amounts of free (ie, non-antibody conjugated) drug to become neurotoxic. Taxanes and epothilones hyperstabilise microtubules, preventing microtubule depolymerisation. Vinca alkaloids (eg, vincristine, vinblastine) and vedotins instead promote microtubule depolymerisation, while eribulin interferes with microtubule dynamics by binding predominantly to a small number of high affinity sites at the plus ends of existing microtubules. The interference of typical antitubulin agents and proteasome inhibitors with microtubule dynamics may negatively affect both anterograde and retrograde axonal transport. In line with this, several in vitro studies demonstrated that eribulin, vincristine, paclitaxel and ixabepilone inhibit anterograde and retrograde transport. Similarly, in vitro data showed that bortezomib is also able to enhance tubulin polymerisationand disrupt axonal transport, while the non-neurotoxic proteasome inhibitor carfilzomib has no effect on microtubules at antineoplastic concentrations. Further, bortezomib has been linked to delta 2 tubulin accumulation, altering microtubule stability and dynamics with consequent axonopathy and altered mitochondria motility. Notably, neurographic in vivo molecular imaging demonstrated axonal transport alterations following platinum chemotherapy. However, further investigations are warranted to determine if it is an early or late event due to another primary mechanism of damage (eg, mitotoxicity as reported below).

### Pharmacogenomics of vincristine-induced peripheral neuropathy implicates pharmacokinetic and inherited neuropathy genes [^113NzC2k]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2019). Medium credibility.

The failure of the first rs924607‐VIPN replication attempt 12 brings to light important phenotypic considerations for pharmacogenomic studies. Unlike the discovery study, which included monitoring during induction and continuation phases of vincristine therapy, Gutierrez‐Camino et al. 12 assessed VIPN solely during the 4‐week induction phase of vincristine therapy. Of note, the majority (63%) of the VIPN cases in our cohort developed toxicity after this 4‐week time frame (Figure S3). Our meta‐analysis was highly significant when excluding this study 12 assessing VIPN only during induction therapy from analysis with no evidence for heterogeneity between studies. It has further been suggested that CEP72 rs924607 may be primarily relevant to patients receiving vincristine doses of < 2 mg/m 2 because higher doses of vincristine may overcome the protective influence of the ancestral genotypes. 13 Indeed, when excluding the CPNDS patients that received vincristine doses ≥ 2 mg/m 2 (i.e. 34.3% of the cohort), the risk genotype was carried exclusively in cases (i.e. 16.1% of 112 cases; Fisher's exact P = 0.007). These findings emphasize the importance of carefully matching drug‐induced phenotypes in pharmacogenomic replication studies. 18

### Nav1.8 in small dorsal root ganglion neurons contributes to vincristine-induced mechanical allodynia [^112BHUpR]. Brain (2024). Medium credibility.

Vincristine-induced peripheral neuropathy is a common side effect of vincristine treatment, which is accompanied by pain and can be dose-limiting. The molecular mechanisms that underlie vincristine-induced pain are not well understood. We have established an animal model to investigate pathophysiological mechanisms of vincristine-induced pain. Our previous studies have shown that the tetrodotoxin-sensitive voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.6 in medium-diameter dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons contributes to the maintenance of vincristine-induced allodynia. In this study, we investigated the effects of vincristine administration on excitability in small-diameter DRG neurons and whether the tetrodotoxin-resistant (TTX-R) Nav1.8 channels contribute to mechanical allodynia. Current-clamp recordings demonstrated that small DRG neurons become hyper-excitable following vincristine treatment, with both reduced current threshold and increased firing frequency. Using voltage-clamp recordings in small DRG neurons, we now show an increase in TTX-R current density and a -7.3 mV hyperpolarizing shift in the half-maximal potential (V1/2) of activation of Nav1.8 channels in vincristine-treated animals, which likely contributes to the hyperexcitability that we observed in these neurons. Notably, vincristine treatment did not enhance excitability of small DRG neurons from Nav1.8 knockout mice, and the development of mechanical allodynia was delayed but not abrogated in these mice. Together, our data suggest that sodium channel Nav1.8 in small DRG neurons contributes to the development of vincristine-induced mechanical allodynia.

### Axonal degeneration in chemotherapy-induced peripheral neurotoxicity: clinical and experimental evidence [^115gmy78]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2023). Medium credibility.

While broadly, CIPN is symptomatically similar when associated with different agents, there are also differences in clinical presentation and phenotype that are agent-specific. Platinum agent oxaliplatin is associated with prominent acute neurotoxicity which produces cold-triggered paraesthesia and muscle cramps acutely following infusion, a profile that does not occur with other platinum agents such as cisplatin. However, both cause a neuronopathy (ie, primary damage of the soma of the sensory neurons of dorsal root ganglia, DRG), resulting in secondary axonal damage and a chronic sensory neuropathy. Taxanes are also associated with a different acute toxicity profile, with an early pain syndrome consisting of myalgias and arthralgias occurring 1–4 days following infusion. Both taxanes and epothilones also produce a chronic sensory predominant neuropathy, although motor neuropathy can develop at higher doses. Distal sensory and motor neuropathy can occur with vinca alkaloids or thalidomide treatment. Proteasome inhibitors such as bortezomib are associated with prominent sensory neuropathy often with neuropathic pain and a higher risk for autonomic neuropathy, although severe autonomic dysfunction is more typical of vincristine. Although targeted, antibody-drug conjugates can also cause off-target effects, with agents such as brentuximab vedotin producing significant neuropathy, probably again through an antitubulin mechanism. More recent immunomodulating drugs, including immune checkpoint inhibitors, can also induce severe neuropathy, but in these cases the features are those of an acute demyelinating damage, and for this reason they will not be discussed further in this review.

Key to understanding these different phenotypic profiles is improved knowledge regarding underlying pathophysiological mechanisms, including axonal degeneration.

### Practice patterns in the diagnosis and management of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy in adolescents and young adults with cancer: a survey of oncologists [^1149ddoW]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) affects > 78% of oncology patients and causes detrimental side effects. There may be practice heterogenicity in CIPN management amongst oncologists treating pediatric, adolescent young adult (AYA), and adult patients with cancer. We sought to evaluate the practice patterns of oncologists regarding their management of CIPN in AYAs with cancer.

Methods

A survey was developed and sent to pediatric and medical oncologists from across the United States. Scenarios included an 18-year-old receiving vincristine (VCR) with mild neuropathy (Scenario 1) and moderate/severe neuropathy (Scenario 2). Respondents were asked how they would manage each patient. Differences between pediatric and medical oncologists' management were assessed.

Results

A total of 179 responses were submitted by 132 (73.7%) pediatric, 44 (24.6%) medical oncologists, and 3 (1.6%) oncologists who care for both pediatric and adult patients. Over half of respondents for Scenario 1 would refer the patient to physical therapy (PT) (56.8%), 38.1% would prescribe a pharmacologic agent, and 27.8% would dose reduce/omit vincristine. For Scenario 2, most (81.8%) would dose reduce/omit vincristine, 69.3% would refer for PT, and 44.9% would start a pharmacologic agent. On multivariable analyses, medical oncologists were more likely to dose reduce/omit vincristine for Scenario 1 (OR, 7.68; 95% CI, 3.24–18.22) and Scenario 2 (OR, 5.52; 95% CI, 1.37–22.18, and less likely to refer to PT for Scenario 1 (OR, 0.12; 95% CI, 0.05–0.31) and Scenario 2 (OR, 0.18; 95% CI, 0.08–0.41).

Conclusion

Our survey suggests a broad spectrum of CIPN management in AYAs with cancer. The heterogenicity in practices and significant differences between pediatric and medical oncologists underscores an urgent need to better understand the source of heterogeneity in CIPN management practices and barriers to evidence-based care delivery.

### Vincristine sulfate [^113LFHj5]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

The mechanisms of action of vincristine sulfate remain under investigation. The mechanism of action of vincristine sulfate has been related to the inhibition of microtubule formation in mitotic spindle, resulting in an arrest of dividing cells at the metaphase stage.

Central nervous system leukemia has been reported in patients undergoing otherwise successful therapy with vincristine sulfate. This suggests that vincristine does not penetrate well into the cerebrospinal fluid.

Pharmacokinetic studies in patients with cancer have shown a triphasic serum decay pattern following rapid intravenous injection. The initial, middle and terminal half–lives are 5 minutes, 2.3 hours, and 85 hours respectively; however, the range of the terminal half–life in humans is from 19 to 155 hours. The liver is the major excretory organ in humans and animals. The metabolism of vinca alkaloids has been shown to be mediated by hepatic cytochrome P450 isoenzymes in the CYP 3A subfamily. This metabolic pathway may be impaired in patients with hepatic dysfunction or who are taking concomitant potent inhibitors of these isoenzymes (see PRECAUTIONS). About 80% of an injected dose of vincristine sulfate appears in the feces and 10% to 20% can be found in the urine. Within 15 to 30 minutes after injection, over 90% of the drug is distributed from the blood into tissue, where it remains tightly, but not irreversibly, bound.

Current principles of cancer chemotherapy involve the simultaneous use of several agents. Generally, each agent used has a unique toxicity and mechanism of action so that therapeutic enhancement occurs without additive toxicity. It is rarely possible to achieve equally good results with single–agent methods of treatment. Thus, vincristine sulfate is often chosen as part of polychemotherapy because of lack of significant bone–marrow suppression (at recommended doses) and of unique clinical toxicity (neuropathy). See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION section for possible increased toxicity when used in combination therapy.

### Vincristine sulfate liposome injection with combination chemotherapy for children, adolescents, and young adults with relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia: a therapeutic advances in childhood leukemia and lymphoma consortium trial [^115khMWR]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

1 | Introduction

Vincristine is a mainstay in the treatment for children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and intensification has the potential to improve outcomes in ALL. Severe peripheral neuropathy, however, has prohibited escalation beyond standard capped doses. Vincristine sulfate liposome injection (VSLI) (Marqibo) is a liposomal formulation of aqueous vincristine that optimizes pharmacokinetics, prolongs circulating half-life, increases tissue penetration, and may be better tolerated than standard vincristine. Based on its efficacy as a single agent, VSLI received accelerated approval from the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2012 for treatment of adults with relapsed/refractory (r/r) ALL, at a dose of 2.25 mg/m 2 /dose without a dose cap. In contrast, standard vincristine is typically given at a dose of 1.5–2.0 mg/m 2 in pediatrics with a dose cap of 2 mg. A Phase I single-center study of VSLI in children and young adults with r/r ALL and solid cancers demonstrated safety, tolerability, and evidence for single-agent activity at the adult maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of 2.25 mg/m 2 /dose, supporting further study in combination.

Studies of VSLI with combination chemotherapy in children had not previously been conducted. Given the single-agent tolerability and activity of VSLI, its use as intensification of vincristine as part of combination chemotherapy regimens might improve outcomes. With emerging data supporting improved outcomes for patients with r/r ALL who proceed to immunotherapy with low-burden disease, identifying safe and effective reinduction regimens to reduce disease burden remains a priority. The UK ALL R3 regimen incorporating mitoxantrone has been identified as one of the most effective reinduction regimens in children with relapsed ALL. Accordingly, through the Therapeutic Advances in Childhood Leukemia & Lymphoma (TACL) consortium, we developed a pilot study, testing the safety and feasibility of VSLI as replacement for standard vincristine in the UK ALL R3 regimen for children and young adults with relapsed ALL. Subsequent amendments extended the utilization of VSLI in a modified three-drug induction and maintenance-type chemotherapy backbones. We now report on our experience with these regimens.

### New model of vincristine-induced neuropathic pain in children: a first step towards prediction and prevention [^113xJXVM]. Pain (2017). Low credibility.

It is an unfortunate fact of life that our understanding of paediatric neuropathic pain lags behind that of adults, despite clear evidence of clinical need. One important source of such pain is vincristine, a vinca alkaloid commonly used to treat paediatric cancers, which causes substantial neurotoxicity and neuropathic pain. Although peripheral neuropathy is a well-recognized side effect of vincristine therapy, the incidence, severity, and the long-term consequences of vincristine-induced neuropathy (VIPN) on the quality of life in children are not well understood. This knowledge gap is partly because of the lack of accepted and clinically feasible assessment tools in pediatric populations but is also because of the lack of a biological mechanistic understanding of how VIPN pain is generated and maintained in children.

The future is therefore substantially brighter following the publication of the first, well-defined, rat model of chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain in early life. In this volume of PAIN, Schappacher, Styczynski, and Baccei use a careful systemic vincristine dosing regime in rats aged 10 to 21 days old to successfully balance the required neurotoxicity with the wellbeing of the rat pups and produce a convincing model of VIPN pain, measured as a significant and long-lasting behavioural mechanical hypersensitivity.

The model highlights some intriguing aspects of childhood chemotherapy pain. During the vincristine treatment regime itself, there was no effect upon mechanical sensitivity. Only 5 days after the treatment had ceased did the hypersensitivity emerge, equally in males and females, and continue well into adulthood. Thus consistent with classic models of direct nerve injury in young animals, the onset of VIPN hypersensitivity is delayed, emerging at adolescence (postnatal day 26). This differs markedly from the adult VIPN pain profile, where mice show significant mechanical hypersensitivity 24 hours after the first vincristine dose.

The clinical symptoms of vincristine-induced peripheral neuropathy are often persistent and can sometimes worsen after the termination of chemotherapy or even emerge after drug withdrawal. There are a number of risk factors, including an inherited polymorphism in the promoter region of CEP72 associated with increased risk and severity of vincristine-related peripheral neuropathy, but one factor that shines through this and other studies is that peripheral neuropathic pain is age dependent. Following nerve trauma, the incidence of neuropathic pain in children increases with the age at which the nerve damage occursand is not observed at all following newborn nerve trauma. Interestingly, increased childhood age is also associated with increased risk of VIPN pain, despite the same vincristine dosing limit at all ages.

### Mechanisms and treatment of cancer therapy-induced peripheral and central neurotoxicity [^111pdqkg]. Nature Reviews: Cancer (2025). High credibility.

Neurotoxicity is a common and potentially severe adverse effect from conventional and novel cancer therapy. The mechanisms that underlie clinical symptoms of central and peripheral nervous system injury remain incompletely understood. For conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy or radiotherapy, direct toxicities to brain structures and neurovascular damage may result in myelin degradation and impaired neurogenesis, which eventually translates into delayed neurodegeneration accompanied by cognitive symptoms. Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy is one of the most prevalent adverse events of chemotherapy, seen specifically with platinum- and taxane-based regimens, vinca alkaloids, thalidomide and bortezomib, and is also emerging as a concerning feature of novel targeted therapies and immunotherapies. In patients treated with molecularly targeted compounds or immune-activating agents, on-target but off-tumour effects and systemic inflammation characterize a distinct clinical profile with predominantly acute neurological symptoms with a phenotype defined by the specific antigen target. The development of mechanistically driven treatment strategies for both central and peripheral nervous system injury from cancer therapies is a major unmet medical need. Clinical trials designed to test pharmacotherapeutic interventions (including anti-dementia drugs or cognitive stimulants) for cognitive symptoms after conventional chemotherapy have produced conflicting results. In the case of acute neurotoxic adverse events from immunotherapies, reversal of T cell expansion together with drugs targeting specific pro-inflammatory interleukins have shown beneficial effects in selected patients. Large clinical trials to test novel strategies and pharmacotherapeutic interventions for acute or delayed neurotoxicity are ongoing. Informed by data derived from clinical trials and preclinical models, promising treatment strategies are on the horizon.

### A retrospective cohort study describing chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy in non-Hodgkin lymphoma patients treated with EPOCH ± R: does HIV status matter? [^114bnw8y]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2024). Medium credibility.

The frontline immuno-chemotherapy regimen for HIV-associated non-Hodgkin Lymphoma is dose-adjusted EPOCH ± R (etoposide, prednisone, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and rituximab). Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN), caused by vincristine, is a common adverse effect of EPOCH ± R, negatively impacting long-term patient outcomes. The primary objective of this study was to determine the incidence of CIPN, stratified by HIV status, in patients treated with EPOCH ± R. A retrospective cohort study at a tertiary referral comprehensive cancer center evaluated patients treated with EPOCH ± R from 2011 to 2018. The final sample included 27 patients with HIV compared to 279 without HIV (total n = 306). Overall, the incidence of CIPN was 29.4% (n = 90), including 5 with HIV (18.5%) and 85 without HIV (30.5%). Propensity scores were used to match patients by HIV status. Although no relationship was found between HIV status and neuropathy, CIPN affects too many undergoing treatments for lymphoma, supporting future investigations to minimize toxicities.

### Genomic variations associated with risk and protection against vincristine-induced peripheral neuropathy in pediatric cancer patients [^114z8wL9]. NPJ Genomic Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

In addition to the previously discussed pathways, defects in cytoskeleton and microfibril architectures have also been implicated in peripheral neuropathies. This study identified ACTN1, NRG3, FBN2, and ARHGAP5 that are involved in maintaining cytoskeletal integrity and regulating cellular processes related to microfibril function. Such processes are essential for ensuring neuronal morphology stability and axonal transport. FBN2 encodes for microfibril, while ACTN1, NRG3, and ARHGAP5 are associated with actin cytoskeleton organization and dynamics –. ACTN1 encodes for alpha-actinin and plays a critical role in axonal growth and guidance. ARHGAP5 is involved in the regulation of Rho GTPases, which are key regulators of cytoskeletal remodeling and cellular motility processes within the peripheral nervous system. Variations within these genes have shown a 40–86% protection against peripheral neuropathy risk, which suggests their contribution to maintaining neuronal structural stability and cellular motility, thereby decreasing the sensitivity of the peripheral nervous system to vincristine-neurotoxicity. Of note, a significant overlap exists in the contributing genes within each pathophysiology (Fig. 2b), suggesting a potential interplay between these pathways underlies protection against susceptibility of vincristine-induced peripheral neuropathy. Based on these results, we hypothesize that vincristine neuropathy risk is influenced by a complex interaction involving multiple neuropathy-related pathophysiology mechanisms (Fig. 3).

### Genomic variations associated with risk and protection against vincristine-induced peripheral neuropathy in pediatric cancer patients [^112fREG1]. NPJ Genomic Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

While our findings provide valuable insights into the genomic associations with vincristine-induced peripheral neuropathy risk, the identified genetic variants in this study should be validated in independent cohorts of children to establish the generalizability and robustness of the findings. Given the rarity of pediatric cancer, securing a sufficiently large independent cohort for replication is challenging. However, validation of the current findings is a critical next step in this work and is now being planned. Functional studies using cellular (e.g. neurons derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells) or animal (e.g. mice, zebrafish, and Caenorhabditis elegans) models are likely to be useful for better understanding the mechanism by which the identified variants are involved in the pathophysiology of vincristine neuropathy. Validation of these findings will be a critical step forward in our efforts to mitigate the burden incurred by this severe reaction on children battling cancer, their families, and caregivers.

One of the most well-known drug interactions in pediatric oncology concerns the co-administration of itraconazole, an antifungal triazole, and vincristine, an antileukemic agent, which seems to enhance the risk of neurotoxicity of the latter, mediated through the cytochrome CYP450 enzyme system. The aim of this article is to review the metabolism of these two drugs, to analyze the published cases with severe triazole-enhanced vincristine neurotoxicity, to discuss the pathophysiological mechanisms of this adverse effect, and to contribute in understanding the differences in triazole-vincristine interaction severity.

Therapy-associated neurological complications

Chemotherapy/cytostatics

The history of cytostatics begins with the chemical warfare agent sulfur mustard, after physicians discovered its antiproliferative effects during World War I. The original use as a chemical warfare agent already suggests a significant potential for side effects of this drug category.

Peripheral neuropathy developed due to cytostatic drugs is the most common neurological complication of anti-tumor therapy, found in 30–70% of oncological patients and significantly contributing to their morbidity and impaired quality of life. Platinum-containing drugs, taxanes, vinca alkaloids, and proteasome inhibitors are among the cytostatic drugs which have proved to activate the mechanisms of peripheral neuropathy.

The severity of neuropathy depends on the various factors, such as the mechanism of action of the cytostatic agent used, the cumulative dose, the duration of use, pre-existing damage to nervous system, and the vulnerability of respective peripheral fiber entities to the chemotherapeutic agent (dorsal root ganglia, distal nerve fibers, motor or autonomic fibers). The most common manifestations of neuropathy include par-, dysaesthesias, allodynia, and hyperalgesia of hands and feet. The exposure to vinca alkaloids, such as vincristine, can lead to primary impairment of motor and autonomic fibers in turn. In addition to significantly impaired quality of life, autonomic dysfunction can also have life-threatening consequences.

### Characterising vincristine-induced peripheral neuropathy in adults: symptom development and long-term persistent outcomes [^112uxAYn]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

To address a gap in current understanding about chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy, the present study has provided an updated natural history analysis of VIPN from baseline to 3 months post treatment, with an examination of chronic VIPN. Compared to prior investigations of VIPN undertaken more than 20 years ago, this study evaluated VIPN using current dosing regimens. Recent studies have utilised retrospective chart review or NCI-CTCAE grading to define neuropathy prevalence and characteristics. However, this clinical study utilised a comprehensive and multifaceted assessment approach, incorporating patient reported, neurological and functional perspectives.

Vincristine produces a chronic sensorimotor dysfunction associated with functional impact. Most patients reported VIPN development by mid-treatment, without further significant change by end-of-treatment. Post treatment recovery occurred within 3 months in a proportion of patients and was associated with improved scores on neurological grading and functional assessment.

Two challenges need to be addressed to improve the outcome of patients with primary central nervous system lymphoma. The first challenge is to develop therapies that result in less toxicity and improved long-term outcome. The second challenge is to develop interventions to help those patients who develop treatment-related neurotoxicity; ongoing collaborative efforts are required to improve communication and understanding of this complication. Long-term follow up of prospective therapeutic studies should report on both disease control and the development of neurotoxicity. New protocols should include prospective longitudinal measures of neurocognitive function.

### An animal model of chemotherapy-induced vagal neuropathy [^111cQHBU]. Muscle & Nerve (2008). Low credibility.

In this study we establish an animal model of chemotherapy-induced autonomic neuropathy. Rats were injected with vincristine (30 and 100 microg/kg/day) for 2 weeks while cardiovascular parameters were collected telemetrically. Vincristine caused a dose-dependent decrease in vagal activity expressed by decreased parasympathetic parameters of heart rate variability, without expression of damage to the cardiac sympathetic innervation. This model can serve in assessing the potential contribution of chemotherapy-induced vagal neuropathy to morbidity and mortality.

### Impact of vincristine dose reduction on outcomes of patients with aggressive B-cell lymphoma treated with (R)-CHOP [^116EvXGH]. Haematologica (2023). Medium credibility.

Even though R-CHOP achieves excellent response rates, treatment-related side effects can have severe impact on quality of life (QoL). One of the most common side effects with relevant dose-limiting toxicity is peripheral polyneuropathy (PNP), mainly caused by VCR and symptoms can be categorized into sensory, motor, autonomic and cranial neuropathy.VCR is a vinca alkaloid, whose pharmacodynamics relies on anti-microtubule activity. Unfortunately, only very limited evidence of effective treatment options for chemotherapy-induced PNP exists and physicians often face the dilemma of dose reduction or omission of VCR while fearing attenuated efficacy. Hence, dose reduction of VCR is performed regularly in clinical practice but its impact on patient outcomes is unclear. In order to provide more evidence regarding this field of investigation, we performed a post hoc analysis of the RICOVER-60 trial, investigating the impact of dose reduction/omission of VCR on the outcome of older patients with aggressive B-cell lymphoma. The RICOVER-60 trial (clinialcaltrials gov. Identifier: NCT0005293 6, EU-20243) randomly assigned (1:1:1:1) 1,222 older patients (aged 61–80 years) with newly diagnosed CD20-positive aggressive B-cell lymphoma to receive six or eight cycles of CHOP chemotherapy every 2 weeks with or without eight biweekly doses of rituximab. Prephase therapy consisted of 1 mg VCR as absolute dose and 100 mg per day of prednisone over 7 days. Decisions concerning VCR dose reduction or omission in any particular treatment cycle were left to the local investigator. The primary endpoint of the RICOVER-60 trial was event-free survival (EFS), secondary endpoints were PFS and OS.

### Acute neurotoxicity following vincristine due to Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease in a young child with medulloblastoma [^115d8JQ1]. Neuro-Oncology Practice (2019). Medium credibility.

Vincristine (VCR), a microtubule inhibitor that arrests the cell cycle by blocking metaphase of mitosis, is unique among the vinca alkaloids for causing polyneuropathy. Patients with increased risk of VCR neurotoxicity include the elderly and those with prior history of neuropathy-prone medical conditions. Identifying such risk factors prior to the development of neurotoxicity should be a goal prior to VCR administration. Clinicians should obtain a thorough medical and family history of neuropathies in any child scheduled to receive neurotoxic medications to avoid exacerbating an underlying disorder. We report a case of a young child with newly diagnosed medulloblastoma who started treatment on a VCR-containing chemotherapy regimen following surgery and craniospinal radiation. She subsequently developed severe peripheral polyneuropathy and new enhancement of the cranial and nerve roots following a relatively low cumulative dose of VCR and was diagnosed with previously unidentified Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMTD) Type 1A. This case highlights that an evaluation of risk factors should be completed prior to initiation of neurotoxic chemotherapies and advocates for testing for inherited neuropathies such as CMTD even in asymptomatic patients when hereditary neuropathy is suspected.

### Association of an inherited genetic variant with vincristine-related peripheral neuropathy in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia [^11431nbg]. JAMA (2015). Excellent credibility.

Importance

With cure rates of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) exceeding 85%, there is a need to mitigate treatment toxicities that can compromise quality of life, including peripheral neuropathy from vincristine treatment.

Objective

To identify genetic germline variants associated with the occurrence or severity of vincristine-induced peripheral neuropathy in children with ALL.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Genome-wide association study of patients in 1 of 2 prospective clinical trials for childhood ALL that included treatment with 36 to 39 doses of vincristine. Genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis and vincristine-induced peripheral neuropathy were assessed in 321 patients from whom DNA was available: 222 patients (median age, 6.0 years; range, 0.1–18.8 years) enrolled in 1994–1998 in the St Jude Children's Research Hospital protocol Total XIIIB with toxic effects follow-up through January 2001, and 99 patients (median age, 11.4 years; range, 3.0–23.8 years) enrolled in 2007–2010 in the Children's Oncology Group (COG) protocol AALL0433 with toxic effects follow-up through May 2011. Human leukemia cells and induced pluripotent stem cell neurons were used to assess the effects of lower CEP72 expression on vincristine sensitivity.

Exposure

Treatment with vincristine at a dose of 1.5 or 2.0 mg/m2.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Vincristine-induced peripheral neuropathy was assessed at clinic visits using National Cancer Institute criteria and prospectively graded as mild (grade 1), moderate (grade 2), serious/disabling (grade 3), or life threatening (grade 4).

Results

Grade 2 to 4 vincristine-induced neuropathy during continuation therapy occurred in 28.8% of patients (64/222) in the St Jude cohort and in 22.2% (22/99) in the COG cohort. A SNP in the promoter region of the CEP72 gene, which encodes a centrosomal protein involved in microtubule formation, had a significant association with vincristine neuropathy (meta-analysis P = 6.3×10(-9)). This SNP had a minor allele frequency of 37% (235/642), with 50 of 321 patients (16%; 95% CI, 11.6%-19.5%) homozygous for the risk allele (TT at rs924607). Among patients with the high-risk CEP72 genotype (TT at rs924607), 28 of 50 (56%; 95% CI, 41.2%-70.0%) developed at least 1 episode of grade 2 to 4 neuropathy, a higher rate than in patients with the CEP72 CC or CT genotypes (58/271 patients [21.4%; 95% CI, 16.9%-26.7%]; P = 2.4×10(-6)). The severity of neuropathy was greater in patients homozygous for the TT genotype compared with patients with the CC or CT genotype (2.4-fold by Poisson regression [P < .0001] and 2.7-fold based on mean grade of neuropathy: 1.23 [95% CI, 0.74–1.72] vs 0.45 [95% CI, 0.3–0.6]; p = 0.004 by t test). Reducing CEP72 expression in human neurons and leukemia cells increased their sensitivity to vincristine.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this preliminary study of children with ALL, an inherited polymorphism in the promoter region of CEP72 was associated with increased risk and severity of vincristine-related peripheral neuropathy. If replicated in additional populations, this finding may provide a basis for safer dosing of this widely prescribed anticancer agent.

### Characterising vincristine-induced peripheral neuropathy in adults: symptom development and long-term persistent outcomes [^114c1Uub]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

The 'coasting' phenomenon, whereby symptoms worsen after end of treatment, was also previously associated with VIPN. However, the present study incorporating multiple assessment techniques found that symptoms had reached their peak by the end of treatment. As observed in a prior study, symptom improvement occurred soon after treatment completion with significant improvements in 3 months post vincristine. This discrepancy may be due to dosing differences, as current practice is to cap each vincristine infusion at 2 mg, and the dosing limit was not applied in the earlier study where 90% of patients had a first dose > 2 mg. In patients that experience improvement, the timecourse of VIPN recovery is similar to that seen in paclitaxel- and bortezomib-induced peripheral neuropathy, where symptom improvement occurs by 3 months after treatment completion. However, this pattern of recoverability is different to platinum agents, where symptoms may worsen for up to 6 months post treatment.

Despite the resolution of VIPN in a proportion of patients, this analysis of chronic VIPN identified significant symptoms which lasted more than 1 year post treatment. Persistent VIPN was associated with reduced spatial acuity in both the upper and lower limbs, reduced fine motor function, reduced sensory and motor nerve amplitudes and increased overall disability. This profile of long-term neuropathy symptoms is similar to deficits resulting from peripheral neuropathy due to other chemotherapies including taxanes and platinums.

### Genomic variations associated with risk and protection against vincristine-induced peripheral neuropathy in pediatric cancer patients [^117PwSXE]. NPJ Genomic Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this largest GWAS of vincristine-induced peripheral neuropathy, we identified 13 significant vincristine peripheral neuropathy-associated loci, including 12 variants that strongly protect against peripheral neuropathy by 40–93% and one variant that increases the odds of developing peripheral neuropathy by 6-fold (Table 2). The pathway analysis showed specificity for the involvement of four key pathways: nerve structure and development (genes involved: ACTN1, LRRTM3, NRG3, VTI1A, NFIB, FBN2, and MCM3AP), nerve myelination (MCM3AP and ZFAND3), neuronal transmission (PDE4D, ACTN1, NRG3, VTI1A, SPDYA, and MCM3AP), and cytoskeleton/microfibril function (ACTN1, NRG3, FBN2, and ARHGAP5) pathways; all are required for the stability and normal function of the peripheral nervous system. Notably, the identified genetic variations within all the identified genes, except for MCM3AP, exhibit a protective effect against the development and progression of neuropathy, potentially modulating biological processes that contribute to the overall integrity of nerve structure and function.

The identified vincristine peripheral neuropathy genes involved in nerve structure pathway (ACTN1, LRRTM3, NRG3, VTI1A, NFIB, and FBN2) are known to play critical roles in the development and maintenance of neuronal networks. Specifically, ACTN1, LRRTM3, and NRG3 are implicated in synapse formation and synaptic plasticity –, suggesting their involvement in regulating neuronal connectivity and communication. VTI1A is primarily associated with the trans-Golgi network in the neuron body and is known to play a key role in neuronal development. NFIB is a transcription factor that regulates neurogenesis of the pontine neurons –, which manage sensory and pain signals. Haploinsufficiency of NFIB in humans is found to result in neurodevelopmental deficits and neuronal malformations. FBN2 is a key component of the extracellular matrix of peripheral nerve, and rare pathogenic missense variants in FBN2 were found to cause early-onset peripheral neuropathy. Variants in all these genes confer significant protection against neuropathy, reducing the risk by 54–93%.

Methods

Study design

Adult patients (aged > 18 years) prescribed vincristine therapy for the treatment of haematological cancers were recruited into an observational study of neuropathy outcomes from hospitals in Sydney, Australia. Patients were eligible if were either about to commence vincristine treatment (prospective arm) or had completed treatment between 3 months and 5 years prior (cross-sectional arm). The study was approved by the Human Research Ethics Committees of South-Eastern Sydney and Sydney Local Health Districts and was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. All patients provided informed written consent prior to study participation.

Patients were eligible for inclusion in this analysis if they had received a cumulative vincristine dose of ≥ 2.8 mg/m 2. To phenotype persistent neuropathy, 57 patients who had completed vincristine treatment (median = 10 months, range = 3–56 months) were included for cross-sectional analysis. To examine the development and progression of VIPN, a subset of 20 patients who had been longitudinally evaluated for neuropathy outcomes were included for prospective analysis (Fig. 1). These patients were assessed at four timepoints: T1 — Early treatment (N = 2 prior to vincristine treatment, N = 18 following single vincristine dose), T2 — midway through prescribed treatment protocol, T3 — upon completion of treatment protocol and T4 — 3–6 months after vincristine treatment.

Study cohort and assessment timepoints

Assessment protocol

At each timepoint, patients completed a comprehensive battery of neuropathy assessments as described below, undertaken by trained researchers. All researchers received uniform neurologist-led training. Procedure protocols and training manuals were devised by senior researchers specifically for this study and were followed in all study visits. Assessors regularly met and worked together to ensure competence and quality control. Patient demographic (including age, BMI, diabetic status, cancer type) and neurotoxic treatment information (including dose, treatment frequency) was collected from medical records.

Children with Down syndrome (DS), who represent about 2% of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia, have inferior prognosis compared to non-DS children. For vincristine (and many other anticancer agents) pharmacokinetic data are scant or missing, and there is considerable uncertainty about the optimal dosing of drugs to patients with DS. We studied vincristine pharmacokinetics on treatment day one in six children with DS and compared to 92 non-DS children. No differences were found. Thus, we found no rationale for dose reduction of vincristine in DS children from a strictly pharmacokinetic point of view.

Characteristic clinical picture and nerve conduction studies favored Guillain-Barré syndrome. The patient improved rapidly with intravenous immunoglobulin and supportive care. It is possible that an immune mechanism damaged the peripheral nervous system in the patient without ruling out the adverse effects of vinca alkaloids.

4 | Discussion

Contemporary data evaluating salvage attempts for children with r/r B-ALL demonstrate a need for enhanced strategies for disease reduction. Moreover, as outcomes of immunotherapy are improved when pretreatment disease burden is low, optimizing chemotherapy-based reinduction remains a priority. Vincristine remains a critical component of ALL therapy, and optimizing its dosing could potentially improve the success of disease burden reduction. This TACL trial combining VSLI with standard chemotherapy was thus undertaken to assess its utility as a vincristine dose-intensification strategy in children with r/r B-ALL.

With a primary focus on safety and tolerability, the initial trial was designed to test the four-drug reinduction combination from UK ALL R3, with a dose-matched replacement of 1.5 mg/m 2 of standard vincristine (with a 2 mg dose cap) for 1.5 mg/m 2 of VSLI (without a dose cap) as the starting point for DL1. The dose escalation to 2 mg/m 2 of VSLI at DL2, therefore, represented an additional vincristine dose intensification upon UK ALL R3, which was potentially further enhanced as doses were not capped. Nonetheless, both tested doses were below the highest dose tested in the pediatric Phase I trial, and the FDA-approved single-agent dose for adults of 2.25 mg/m 2 /dose given weekly without a dose cap. Importantly, this dosing schema mirrored the prior Children's Oncology Group Study AALL0433, which randomized patients to standard vincristine (1.5 mg/m 2, 2 mg cap) to intensified vincristine (2 mg/mg 2, 2.5 mg cap). However, due to increased ≥ Grade 3 peripheral neuropathy in the intensified arm, the vincristine randomization on AALL0433 was closed. The subsequent amendments to include anthracycline-free induction (Cohort B) and maintenance-style utilization of VSLI (Cohort C) enabled further exploration of VSLI in a broad setting, and facilitated the inclusion of patients with Down syndrome, a population that remains in need of novel approaches and is often excluded from early-phase studies because of concerns for toxicity.

Patients and methods

Cohort description

In this retrospective bi-center cohort study, we included 987 patients who were presented for treatment of histologically confirmed de novo DLBCL at the Division of Hematology, Medical University of Graz ("Graz cohort": n = 605), or the third Medical Department at the Paracelsus Medical University Salzburg ("Salzburg cohort": n = 382), both of which are located in Austria, between 2001 and 2020. Patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positivity, transformed low-grade lymphoma, high-grade lymphoma, and Burkitt lymphoma, and patients who did not receive full dosage R-CHOP in 21-day cycles (R-CHOP21) were excluded in the Graz cohort for evaluation of vinorelbine treatment (Fig. 1a). Patients treated within the Salzburg cohort met the same inclusion criteria, but dosage of vincristine and doxorubicin was adapted according to adverse events (Supplementary Table 1). Data on baseline characteristics and clinical outcomes were ascertained from our in-house electronic healthcare database system, as previously described. The research project was approved by the local institutional review boards (EK-Votum: 32–306 ex19/20 ethikkommission@medunigraz.at and EK-Votum: 415-EP/73/127–2012 ethikkommission@salzburg.gv.at).

Rationale behind switching to vinorelbine

Replacement of vincristine in R-CHOP by vinorelbine has been established as a local standard on an empirical basis in Graz to deliver the full antitumor activity of a vinca-alkaloid after development of any sign of neuropathy. The rationale behind this approach is the substitution of the most neurotoxic vinca-alkaloid vincristine with one of the least neurotoxic, i.e. vinorelbine, in a regimen called Vino-R-CAP in order to reduce or stop progression of VIPN without discontinuation of the substance class.

### Vinorelbine as substitute for vincristine in patients with diffuse large B cell lymphoma and vincristine-induced neuropathy [^116EygU9]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The R-CHOP immunochemotherapy regimen achieves reasonable survival and cure rates in patients with DLBCL. Despite all efforts which have been made in unraveling the molecular mechanisms of lymphomagenesis, establishing new risk models for outcome prediction, and employing promising new substances for treatment within clinical trials, (R)-CHOP continues to represent the standard first-line therapy for the last 40 years. One of the major toxic sequelae caused by this regimen is VIPN which affects between 20 and 40% of all patients. A retrospective analysis from Korea reports VIPN rates of up to 85% in patients with DLBCL or follicular lymphoma treated with R-CHOP causing deterioration in quality of life. Known risk factors of VIPN are cumulative dose of vincristine, older age, and ethnicity, as well as genetic polymorphisms. The most common approach to influence VIPN during R-CHOP treatment is dose reduction or discontinuation of vincristine. However, there is increasing evidence that dose-dense chemotherapy is seminal for improving remission and survival rates. To the best of our knowledge, there are only two published studies focusing on the issue of vincristine dose reduction in DLBCL patients delivering contradictory results regarding survival outcomes. Utsu et al. showed significantly impaired outcomes in patients with vincristine dose reduction due to neuropathy which is in agreement with our data provided in the "Salzburg-Cohort". They had very stringent inclusion criteria and considered only de novo DLBCL patients treated with R-CHOP21 similar to our study. On the contrary, there was no difference in treatment outcomes between patients with or without vincristine dose reduction in the study by Mörth et al. However, they had more arbitrary inclusion criteria with a more heterogeneous patient population and different chemotherapy regimens probably leading to a profound selection bias. Nonetheless, both studies did not demonstrate an improvement of VIPN after vincristine dose reduction.

Conclusions

The present study underscores the importance of examining neuropathy symptom profiles within different age groups and clinical cohorts, using a multifaceted approach. The results provide a natural history of VIPN from development to recovery, with a further snapshot of chronic persistence post treatment completion. Understanding the clinical presentation of VIPN and the recovery profile, as well as the functional impact of neuropathy, will enable rehabilitation and management strategies to be targeted to patients with persistent functional disability most in need of intervention.

### Vincristine sulfate [^114XgE1n]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

General

Acute uric acid nephropathy, which may occur after the administration of oncolytic agents, has also been reported with vincristine sulfate. In the presence of leukopenia or a complicating infection, administration of the next dose of Vincristine Sulfate Injection warrants careful consideration.

If central nervous system leukemia is diagnosed, additional agents may be required, because vincristine does not appear to cross the blood–brain barrier in adequate amounts.

Particular attention should be given to dosage and neurologic side effects if Vincristine Sulfate Injection is administered to patients with preexisting neuromuscular disease and when other drugs with neurotoxic potential are also being used.

Acute shortness of breath and severe bronchospasm have been reported following the administration of vinca alkaloids. These reactions have been encountered most frequently when the vinca alkaloid was used in combination with mitomycin–C and may require aggressive treatment, particularly when there is preexisting pulmonary dysfunction. The onset of these reactions may occur minutes to several hours after the vinca alkaloid is injected and may occur up to 2 weeks following the dose of mitomycin. Progressive dyspnea requiring chronic therapy may occur. Vincristine sulfate should not be readministered.

Care must be taken to avoid contamination of the eye with concentration of Vincristine Sulfate Injection used clinically. If accidental contamination occurs severe irritation (or, if the drug was delivered under pressure, even corneal ulceration) may result. The eye should be washed immediately and thoroughly.

Laboratory Tests

Because dose–limiting clinical toxicity is manifested as neurotoxicity clinical evaluation (e.g., history, physical examination) is necessary to detect the need for dosage modification. Following administration of Vincristine Sulfate Injection, some individuals may have a fall in the white blood cell count or platelet count, particularly when previous therapy or the disease itself has reduced bone–marrow function. Therefore, a complete blood count should be done before administration of each dose. Acute elevation of serum uric acid may also occur during induction of remission in acute leukemia; thus, such levels should be determined frequently during the first 3 to 4 weeks of treatment or appropriate measures taken to prevent uric acid nephropathy. The laboratory performing these tests should be consulted for its range of normal values.

### Mechanism-based treatment for chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathic pain [^117D8bcF]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2014). Medium credibility.

Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathic pain (CIPNP)-a severe adverse effect observed in up to 80% of patients during treatment with antineoplastic drugs-limits the tolerable dose of cytostatics, and can lead to discontinuation of chemotherapy. Many drugs that are approved for the treatment of other neuropathic pain states have shown little or no analgesic effect on CIPNP in large randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials. Here, we review the known mechanisms of CIPNP induced by the three most commonly used cytostatics: paclitaxel, oxaliplatin and vincristine. These substances have distinct neurotoxic and neuroinflammatory properties, but they also have overlapping contributions to pathogenesis of CIPNP that could potentially be targeted for prevention or treatment of CIPNP. We discuss the failure of previously tested antioxidants, neuroprotective agents, anticonvulsants and antidepressants as therapeutic or preventative strategies, and suggest individualized, mechanism-based therapeutic options for CIPNP associated with each of the three main drug groups. We point out the necessity to assess drug efficacy in CIPNP independently of other neuropathic pain states, and emphasize the need for delineation of subpopulations of patients with CIPNP for more-efficient treatment. Finally, we discuss novel therapeutic strategies and recent progress in treatment of CIPNP, and evaluate the potential benefits of these recent proceedings for future therapies.

### NF1 optic pathway glioma: analyzing risk factors for visual outcome and indications to treat [^117TkKr3]. Neuro-Oncology (2021). Medium credibility.

As a consequence, we propose that eligibility criteria for future trials should include evidence, and timing, of prior visual decline, where it can be identified, as a factor for case selection for treatment and in analysis of visual outcomes. The role of optic atrophy could be better explored using optical coherence tomography, where retinal fiber layer thickness correlates with neuronal loss, offering a more objective measure of optic pathway injury as an outcome measure for early intervention trials.

Our findings suggest that, for many, treatment may be starting when nerve damage has already occurred and become irreversible and that VC is only preserving, rather than improving, vision. It also justifies more detailed consideration of the mechanisms of vision loss and therapeutic impact of treatment(s) under trial. The goal is to restore, or at least preserve, optic nerve function.

One factor to be considered is the continued use of any drug with known neurotoxicity, such as weekly vincristine. Vincristine has a protracted half-life of about 5 days, making weekly scheduling lead to accumulation of tissue levels. Vincristine peripheral neuropathy is a recognized complication of weekly scheduling necessitating dose reduction or cessation of therapy. A recent case report and literature review identifies 12 cases, 9 in children (age < 18 y) with optic atrophy and blindness after the use of vincristine for various cancer therapies. The COG A9952 study reported grade 3 and 4 neurotoxicity in 23% of NF1 patients receiving VC, which included weekly vincristine in induction. This drug combination, while standard, has never been tested in a randomized comparison and so is the de facto, rather than the tested, standard treatment. Reconsideration of vincristine dosing and scheduling may be justified.

Observation Strategy

The role of monitoring asymptomatic children with NF1 by prediagnostic MR imaging of the brain is disputed. The present analysis revealed that patients who had MRI as part of surveillance were at a lower risk of visual deterioration (Table 1) in univariate analysis (crude OR: 0.36; 95% CI: 0.14–0.93) but not in the multivariable analysis (adjOR: 0.77, 95% CI: 0.25–2.34). Novel MRI techniques such as fractional anisotropy and MRI volumetry of the optic pathway in conjunction with optical coherence tomography may help identify preclinical signs of neuronal loss and therefore those at higher risk for visual deterioration, which may justify changes to screening guidelines. Confirmation in population trials is needed especially if new treatments were demonstrated to be less toxic and more effective than current approaches with chemotherapy.

### Central nervous system toxicity from cancer therapies [^114qb64o]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

The central nervous system (CNS) is an organ with a unique profile of vulnerability to antineoplastic treatments. In many cases, CNS neurotoxicity is the dose-limiting side effect of treatment for systemic and CNS neoplasms. Novel methods of delivering radiation and chemotherapy agents have led to recognition of new forms of CNS neurotoxicity. In this article, the authors review the most important CNS toxicities of cancer treatment.

### Vincristine: can its therapeutic index be enhanced? [^112W2zma]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2009). Low credibility.

Vincristine is one of the most widely used and more effective drugs in paediatric oncology. The dose-limiting toxicity of neuropathy, lack of proven neuroprotective measures and an incomplete understanding of the pharmacokinetics and pharmacogenetics of vincristine have limited its therapeutic potential. Recent advances in the understanding of vincristine pharmacokinetics and pharmacogenetics, and potential methods of preventing neurotoxicity are reviewed which could enable dose escalation and dose individualisation in order to enhance the therapeutic index.

### Central nervous system complications of oncologic therapy [^115xka72]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Traditional and newer agents used to treat cancer can cause significant toxicity to the central nervous system. MRI of the brain and spine is the imaging modality of choice for patients with cancer who develop neurologic symptoms. It is important to be aware of the agents that can cause neurotoxicity and their associated imaging findings so that patients are properly diagnosed and treated. In some instances conventional MRI may not be able to differentiate posttreatment effects from disease progression. In these instances advanced imaging techniques may be helpful, although further research is still needed.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: central nervous system cancers, version 2.2022 [^114x2Jkb]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2023). High credibility.

Medulloblastoma — systemic therapy and recurrence regimens: Concomitant chemotherapy (vincristine) is typically omitted in adults given potential for severe toxicity, and post‑irradiation systemic therapy to allow radiotherapy (RT) dose reduction is becoming increasingly common especially for children, but optimal use of adjuvant chemotherapy is still unclear for adult patients. Neoadjuvant therapy has not shown a benefit in pediatric or adult patients, although it is used in infants to defer radiation. A phase III study enrolled more than 400 patients between 3 and 21 years of age with average‑risk disease to receive post‑irradiation cisplatin‑based chemotherapy and recorded 86% 5‑year survival. In recurrence, regimens in use commonly include etoposide; temozolomide has also been used, and high‑dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell transplantation is feasible after good response to conventional‑dose chemotherapy, although long‑term control is rarely achieved. SHH‑pathway inhibitors evaluated in phase II trials of recurrent disease include vismodegib and sonidegib, with patients with SHH‑activated disease more likely to respond than those with non‑SHH disease.

### The antiallodynic effect of nefopam on vincristine-induced neuropathy in mice [^112HosHb]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a disabling condition following cancer chemotherapy, characterised by sensory (hyperalgesia, paresthesia, dysesthesia, allodynia, spontaneous pain), motor (weakness, incoordination), and autonomic (altered thermoregulation, blood pressure, intestinal motility) symptoms. Although the pathophysiology of CIPN is not clear, it probably results from loss of sensory terminals in the skin; alterations of membrane receptors; and changes in intracellular signaling, neurotransmission, excitability, and cellular metabolism. A reduction in Meissner's corpuscles and loss of epidermal nerve fibers are other possible mechanisms of CIPN. The development of CIPN may lead to a reduction in dose or discontinuation of chemotherapy, which can result in increased cancer morbidity and/or mortality. Because of these multiple mechanisms for the development of CIPN, so far, no agent has been reported to be successful in controlling CIPN optimally. Vincristine is one of the most commonly used chemotherapeutic agents for blood cancer and solid tumors. Vincristine has been known to induce microtubule destabilisation and deficits in axonal transport, and thus, has more neurotoxicity than other vinca alkaloid agents.

Nefopam has drawn interest for its antinociceptive and antihyperalgesic effects; it acts by influencing monoamines, and the noradrenergic and/or serotonergic system, resulting in the prevention and reduction of central neural sensitisation.–In a study with spinal nerve ligation models, intrathecal nefopam produced an antiallodynic effect by inhibition of microglial and astrocytic activation, which are reportedly involved in the release of nociceptive mediators and facilitation of the pain process pathway. However, the effect of nefopam on allodynia in vincristine neuropathy and the precise mechanism involved are not well understood. Gautam et al described that the neurokinin-1 (NK1) receptor is functionally associated with mechanosensitive nociceptors and neurotransmission at the spinal level. They reported that intrathecal administration of NK1 antagonist resulted in an antiallodynic effect in the post-incisional pain model. The NK1 receptor antagonist inhibits excitatory postsynaptic potential in the dorsal horn neurons, resulting in attenuation of spinothalamic neuron activation and prevention of nociceptive sensitisation. Therefore, we evaluated the correlation of different doses of nefopam with the antiallodynic effect in the mouse vincristine neuropathy model. In addition, the concentration of NK1 receptor in the spinal cord was assayed.

### Vincristine-induced peripheral neurotoxicity: a prospective cohort [^116Tt7Xf]. Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (2020). Medium credibility.

Vincristine-induced peripheral neuropathy (VIPN) is a serious and pervasive problem, affecting 12–78% of pediatric patients, based on retrospective studies. The study objective was to prospectively collect a cohort of well-phenotyped patients receiving vincristine in order to accurately classify and grade their neurotoxicity. All children in British Columbia with leukemia or lymphoma requiring vincristine between 2013 and 2016 were approached for consent. Those recruited were assessed by occupational and physiotherapists at baseline, mid and endpoint of their treatment. Assessments included the Bruininks-Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency - 2nd ed. (BOT-2), strength, "Timed up and go" test and vibration sensibility. Seventy-two patients consented (age: 2.0–18.7years). The majority were below average for age on one or more BOT-2 domains at midpoint (N = 32/45, 71%), which decreased by the endpoint (N = 19/41, 46%, p = .049). Six patients showed severe VIPN throughout treatment (N = 6/53, 11%), defined as a BOT-2 score well below average. Muscle strength for wrist extension/flexion, anterior tibialis and peronei decreased significantly between baseline (Median = 5) and midpoint (Median = 4), with no significant change noted by endpoint. Most patients had normal vibration sensibility in lower (N = 30/60, 50%) and upper limbs (N = 26/38, 68%). In conclusion, with no differences between time points. VIPN is highly prevalent among patients with pediatric cancer, causing significant morbidity and functional deficits. Identification of risk factors would allow for resource appropriation to patients at higher risk, as well as potentially permitting dose escalation in patients with low toxicity to improve survival.

### Acute lymphoblastic leukemia, version 2.2024, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^111KWfEt]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). High credibility.

Acute lymphoblastic leukemia induction therapy describes that induction regimens are typically based on vincristine, an anthracycline, and a corticosteroid with or without L-asparaginase and/or cyclophosphamide; BFM/COG regimens are mainly 4-drug (vincristine, an anthracycline, a corticosteroid, and L-asparaginase), while some CALGB studies used a 5-drug regimen adding cyclophosphamide. Randomized studies in children showed dexamethasone versus prednisone decreased isolated CNS relapse and improved EFS. A meta-analysis found reduced event rate (RR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.68–0.94) and CNS relapse (RR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.44–0.65) with dexamethasone, with no advantage for bone marrow relapse (RR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.69–1.18) or overall mortality (RR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.76–1.09), but higher risks of mortality during induction (RR, 2.31; 95% CI, 1.46–3.66), neuropsychiatric adverse events (RR, 4.55; 95% CI, 2.45–8.46), and myopathy (RR, 7.75; 95% CI, 3.00–16.58) compared with prednisone.

### Pharmacogenomics of vincristine-induced peripheral neuropathy implicates pharmacokinetic and inherited neuropathy genes [^112QqFuQ]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2019). Medium credibility.

Results

A total of 167 cases (i.e. VIPN grade ≥ 2) and 57 controls (i.e. VIPN grade 0) met clinical and genomic quality control and were included in the discovery pharmacogenomic association studies, after excluding 29 patients with grade 1 VIPN and 12 patients with only cranial or autonomic neurotoxicities (Figure S1, Table S1). This study design is classified as a nonmatched case‐control association study, in which significantly different clinical and demographic factors between cases and controls were corrected for during pharmacogenomic association analyses. The majority of VIPN cases were classified as grade 2 (n = 100), followed by grade 3 (n = 66), and grade 4 (n = 1). The median days from first vincristine dose to VIPN were 57 (interquartile range: 18–127 days). Patients were predominantly of European genetic ancestry (78%, Figure S2) and treatment protocol information is listed in Table S2. Table 1 depicts differences in clinical and demographic factors between VIPN cases and controls. Cases were more likely to be male and received vincristine for a longer duration compared to controls (median of 812 days vs. median of 757 days). All controls, however, received vincristine for at least 16 months, a period of time in which 94% of cases had developed VIPN (Figure S3), indicating sufficient follow‐up time. The cumulative vincristine dose was not significantly associated with case status, whereas duration of treatment was. This observation may have resulted from the fact that many VIPN cases had either vincristine doses held or reduced during treatment as a result of the experienced toxicities, which may explain the difference in therapy duration and the lack of association with cumulative dose. Cases were also more likely to have received nifedipine compared to controls. To help reduce the influence of potential confounders on the genetic association analyses, all significantly associated demographic/clinical variables (i.e. sex, vincristine duration, and nifedipine use) were included as covariates in regression models along with genetic ancestry.

### Genomic variations associated with risk and protection against vincristine-induced peripheral neuropathy in pediatric cancer patients [^114so7r7]. NPJ Genomic Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

In addition, several genetic variations have been associated with the risk of vincristine-induced neuropathy. Since the first pharmacogenetic study of vincristine-induced neuropathy by Aplenc et al. demonstrating the role of genetic variants in CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 in 2003, additional studies have implicated genetic variations in genes encoding components of vincristine pharmacokinetics: metabolism (e.g. CYP3A4, CYP3A5, and DPYD) –, distribution (e.g. ABCC1 and ABCC2), and elimination (e.g. ABCB1 and ABCC2); as well as vincristine pharmacodynamics: vincristine cellular targets (e.g. CEP72, CAPG, and MAPT) – and neuropathy-related pathways (e.g. SLC5A7 and NKAIN3).

Thus far, drug treatment of neuropathy results in modest improvements at best. Nonetheless, emerging pharmacogenomic findings offer opportunities for further study of personalized or adaptive dosing strategies (e.g. treatment regimens with higher or lower dose intensity) and/or closer monitoring and proactive management (e.g. the addition of pre-emptive physiotherapy in patients at high-risk) to alleviate or prevent vincristine-induced peripheral neuropathy, which can adversely affect patients' quality of life and longevity due to dose reduction or treatment omission despite the improved survival rate of cancers. This study aims to investigate genomic risk factors of vincristine peripheral neuropathy in a large cohort of pediatric cancer patients using a genome-wide approach to identify pharmacogenomic markers implicated with neuropathy pathology and risk.

Methods

Patients and clinical assessment

Pediatric patients with ALL (age at diagnosis ≤ 18 years) receiving treatment protocols, including vincristine, were recruited from seven pediatric hospitals across Canada (Calgary, London, Ottawa, Montréal, Toronto, Vancouver, and Winnipeg). Written informed consent and/or assent was obtained from all participants or their parents/legal guardians. The study was approved by ethics committees at participating universities and hospitals. Relevant clinical and demographic data were collected using the CPNDS active surveillance methodology. 34 This included capturing information for relevant concomitant medications (e.g. CYP3A inhibitors, because these enzymes represent the major metabolic path of vincristine). 7, 35

Patients were assessed for vincristine‐related neurotoxicities using a refined National Cancer Institute (NCI) CTCAE version 4.0 Grading System (Table S1). Specifically, to facilitate grading of the retrospective clinical data and standardize grading across multiple sites, this system included definitions of neurotoxicity‐related clinically based interventions, such as pharmacotherapy, rehabilitative therapy, and vincristine dose reductions, to complement the relatively broad definitions (e.g. "noninvasive intervention" or "limiting activities of daily living") used in the CTCAE. To be considered for grading, any intervention had to be used specifically for the treatment for vincristine‐related neurotoxicities, and any symptom had to be attributed to vincristine‐related neurotoxicities. We excluded patients with grade one (minor) VIPN from our initial pharmacogenomic nonmatched case‐control association analyses (Figure S1, cases were defined as grade ≥ 2, whereas controls were defined as patients not developing neuropathy, referred to as grade 0), because the need for a predictive biomarker is greater in those patients with neurotoxicity of sufficient severity to warrant a modification in clinical care (increased monitoring and drug therapy changes). In addition, patients presenting only with symptoms of cranial or central nervous system neurotoxicities without motor or sensory neurotoxicity were not included in the analysis.
