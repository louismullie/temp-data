## Question

Best diet for uncomplicated diverticulitis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the best diet for uncomplicated diverticulitis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying the clinical context and definitions. Then, I should verify what high-credibility guidelines say about diet during the acute phase. Next, I will examine the evidence for advancing the diet and whether unrestricted eating is safe. After that, I need to review long-term dietary strategies for recurrence prevention and reconcile conflicting guidance. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, patient-centered recommendation and highlight special populations and follow-up considerations.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and definitions so I don't anchor on outdated assumptions. Uncomplicated diverticulitis typically lacks abscess, perforation, stricture, or fistula, and most patients can be managed as outpatients with careful follow-up, which frames the dietary advice I will give [^115hsLFY] [^111wzpRm]. I should also remember that the risk of complicated disease is highest at first presentation, which influences counseling and vigilance during the acute phase [^1136QV4j].

> Now, I need to check what authoritative guidelines recommend for diet during the acute phase. The AGA advises a clear liquid diet for comfort during the acute episode and advancing as symptoms improve, with prompt follow-up if diet cannot be advanced in 3–5 days, which signals a need to reassess for occult complications or alternative diagnoses [^116TdHKX]. Wait, let me verify whether stricter restrictions are necessary; the ESCP notes insufficient evidence to mandate dietary restrictions during acute diverticulitis and suggests an unrestricted diet when tolerated, which aligns with a more permissive, patient-tolerance–based approach rather than rigid fasting or overly restrictive diets [^112bnBSJ]. I should also note that a prospective cohort allowed an unrestricted diet during a first episode and reported complication rates comparable to standard care, supporting the safety of liberalization when patients can tolerate it [^115m6K7H].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about "best" being synonymous with "unrestricted". I should confirm how to operationalize diet advancement. Start with clear liquids for comfort and hydration, then advance to low-residue or soft solids as pain, fever, and nausea abate, and finally transition to a regular, high-quality diet once symptoms have largely resolved; if the patient cannot advance after 3–5 days, I need to ensure reassessment for complications or alternative diagnoses rather than persisting with overly restrictive intake [^116TdHKX]. I should double-check that this staged approach remains consistent with contemporary outpatient management principles, which it does, including the emphasis on selective antibiotics and close follow-up in uncomplicated cases [^111wzpRm] [^111FL5kK].

> Next, I should review long-term dietary strategies for secondary prevention, and I need to be careful about the strength of evidence. The AGA recommends a high-quality diet emphasizing fiber from fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and legumes, alongside weight management, physical activity, smoking cessation, and avoidance of regular NSAIDs, recognizing that about half of diverticulitis risk is heritable and not modifiable by diet alone [^115yxekC] [^1161nDsd]. But wait, what if fiber doesn't clearly prevent recurrence? The ESCP concludes evidence is insufficient to endorse a high-fiber diet solely to prevent recurrence, even though fiber may be reasonable for general health; this is a key nuance I must communicate to avoid overpromising benefit [^11693MhF]. I should also confirm that nuts, seeds, corn, and popcorn need not be avoided, as AGA advises against routine elimination of these foods, which helps reduce unnecessary dietary fear [^1135Rqvq] [^114UsyyG].

> Let me synthesize a practical, patient-centered recommendation while keeping these tensions in mind. During the acute phase, a clear liquid diet is reasonable for comfort, with early advancement to tolerance; if the patient cannot advance in 3–5 days, reassess clinically. Once inflammation subsides, transition to a high-quality, fiber-rich dietary pattern with fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and legumes, coupled with weight control, regular physical activity, smoking cessation, and judicious NSAID use, while explicitly permitting nuts, seeds, corn, and popcorn unless individually poorly tolerated [^116TdHKX] [^115yxekC] [^1135Rqvq]. I should confirm that this aligns with primary care guidance and recent reviews, which similarly emphasize a high-quality diet and lifestyle measures without restrictive bans on specific foods [^116Wjddp] [^116N6JqG].

> But wait, what about special populations where my threshold for caution should be lower. In immunocompromised patients, older adults with significant comorbidity, those with systemic toxicity, or individuals unable to maintain hydration, I should favor closer monitoring, a lower threshold for hospitalization, and a more conservative dietary progression, even though the core principle remains to advance as tolerated with careful follow-up [^114q159b] [^114spdCt]. I need to ensure that any deviation from the standard outpatient pathway is justified by clinical risk and that patients understand red flags warranting urgent reassessment [^114q159b].

> I should double-check follow-up and diagnostic considerations that intersect with diet counseling. Persistent or recurrent symptoms after an episode warrant imaging and lower endoscopy to exclude ongoing inflammation or alternative diagnoses, and if no inflammation is found, visceral hypersensitivity or other functional disorders should be considered and managed accordingly, which can prevent unnecessary dietary overrestriction [^113LtfTL] [^116V4vdC]. Routine colonoscopy after resolved uncomplicated diverticulitis is not universally required; decisions should be individualized based on prior colonoscopy quality, age, and risk features, reinforcing that diet counseling should be embedded in comprehensive, risk-stratified care [^116ggVUe] [^111PGekX].

> In summary, I need to ensure my final message is precise and balanced. The best diet for uncomplicated diverticulitis is not a single static prescription but a phased, tolerance-based approach: clear liquids during the acute phase with prompt advancement as symptoms improve, followed by adoption of a high-quality, fiber-rich dietary pattern and healthy lifestyle habits for long-term care, while avoiding unnecessary restrictions like eliminating nuts, seeds, corn, or popcorn and recognizing that fiber's role in preventing recurrence is uncertain even if it is sensible for overall health [^116TdHKX] [^115yxekC] [^1135Rqvq] [^11693MhF]. I should confirm that patients understand to seek reassessment if they cannot advance their diet within 3–5 days or if symptoms persist or recur, aligning expectations with contemporary evidence and guideline consensus [^116TdHKX] [^113WZBLt].

The best diet for uncomplicated diverticulitis is a **clear liquid diet for 2–3 days** [^113WZBLt] during the acute phase for comfort, then advance to low-fiber solids as tolerated, and transition to a **high-fiber diet** [^115yxekC] after recovery to reduce recurrence risk [^1164Qsgz]. There is **no need to avoid nuts, seeds, popcorn, or fruits with small seeds** [^1135Rqvq]; these are not linked to increased risk [^116N6JqG]. Fiber intake should be individualized — increase gradually to minimize bloating, and use supplements if dietary fiber is inadequate [^117GhTpD]. Maintain hydration, limit red meat [^114GvXvx], and avoid NSAIDs to further lower recurrence risk [^115yxekC].

---

## Acute phase dietary management

During the acute phase of uncomplicated diverticulitis, the primary goals are to **reduce gastrointestinal stimulation**, minimize inflammation, and provide symptom relief [^115hsLFY].

---

### Clear liquid diet (days 1–3)

- **Recommendation**: A clear liquid diet is recommended for the first 2–3 days [^notfound] following the onset of symptoms [^116TdHKX].

- **Rationale**: This approach reduces gastrointestinal stimulation, minimizes inflammation, and provides symptom relief [^116TdHKX].

- **Examples**: Water, broth, clear juices, gelatin, and electrolyte solutions.

---

### Advancement to low-fiber diet (days 3–5)

After the initial clear liquid phase, patients should **advance to a low-fiber diet** as tolerated [^113WZBLt]. Include foods such as white rice, pasta, cooked vegetables without seeds, lean proteins, and refined cereals. The rationale is to gradually reintroduce solid foods while minimizing gastrointestinal irritation [^notfound].

---

## Long-term dietary management and prevention of recurrence

Following recovery from acute diverticulitis, long-term dietary strategies focus on **reducing recurrence risk** and maintaining overall gastrointestinal health [^114GvXvx].

---

### High-fiber diet

- **Recommendation**: A high-fiber diet is recommended for long-term management and prevention of recurrent diverticulitis [^1164Qsgz].

- **Rationale**: Fiber intake is associated with a reduced risk of recurrent diverticulitis and improved gastrointestinal function [^1164srfS].

- **Examples**: Fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, and fiber supplements if dietary intake is insufficient [^116N6JqG].

---

### Foods to include

Encourage a variety of **fruits and vegetables** — fresh, frozen, or canned without added sugars or sodium — and **whole grains** such as oats, brown rice, quinoa, whole wheat bread, and pasta. Include **lean proteins** like poultry, fish, tofu, and legumes, and maintain adequate **hydration** with at least 8 cups of water daily [^116Wjddp].

---

### Foods to avoid or limit

Limit **red meat** — such as beef, pork, and lamb — which is associated with an increased risk of diverticulitis recurrence [^notfound]. Avoid **NSAIDs** — regular use (≥ 2 times per week) increases recurrence risk [^115yxekC]. Minimize **processed foods** — high-fat, high-sugar, and highly processed items should be limited [^notfound].

---

## Controversial foods: nuts, seeds, popcorn, and fruits with small seeds

Historically, patients with diverticulitis were advised to avoid nuts, seeds, popcorn, and fruits with small seeds due to concerns about obstruction or irritation. However, **recent evidence** indicates no increased risk of diverticulitis or complications with these foods [^116N6JqG]. Current recommendations: patients **do not need to avoid** nuts, seeds, popcorn, or fruits with small seeds [^111YyGc8] [^116N6JqG].

---

## Role of dietary fiber supplements

For patients unable to meet fiber needs through diet alone, **fiber supplements** can be beneficial [^117Gdktu]. Options include psyllium husk, methylcellulose, and calcium polycarbophil. Supplements should be introduced gradually to minimize gastrointestinal discomfort [^notfound].

---

## Individualized dietary planning

Dietary recommendations should be **individualized** based on patient preferences, tolerance, and clinical history. Gradual fiber introduction helps minimize bloating and discomfort, and patients should be monitored for recurrence or chronic symptoms to guide ongoing dietary management [^113LtfTL].

---

Management of uncomplicated diverticulitis

Need for antibiotics

The need for antibiotics during an uncomplicated episode of diverticulitis has been challenged for at least a decade. There have been several well-designed randomized controlled trials (RCTs) providing Level I evidence and informing numerous society recommendations on the omission of antibiotics in uncomplicated diverticulitis. However, this movement has not yet gained such significant traction in American populations as it has in the European populations in which it was originally studied.

The AVOD trial was initially published in 2012, and followed Swedish patients with uncomplicated diverticulitis who were randomized to treatment with or without antibiotics. Neither the initial study, nor the recent long-term follow up published in 2019, suggested any differences in outcomes between the 2 groups. At a median follow up of 11 years, there were similar rates of recurrence, surgery, and development of colorectal cancer (CRC) in both groups.

The Dutch Diverticular Disease (3D) Study group published the DIABOLO RCT in 2017 with similar findings suggesting the safety of avoiding antibiotic therapy in patients with uncomplicated diverticulitis. No significant differences were found at 6 months in days to recovery, recurrence, readmission rates or mortality, among other endpoints. Their 24-month follow up published in 2018 also supported this conclusion.

Despite solid evidence refuting the routine use of antibiotics in uncomplicated diverticulitis, controversy remains. A 2018 joint survey of members of the Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons and the European Association of Endoscopic Surgery found that only 26% of them endorsed a trial of treatment without antibiotics, and half of them still would not practice this society recommendation.

Restriction of diet during acute flare

It has long been common practice to restrict fiber intake and pursue conservative diets during an episode of diverticulitis; however, there is little evidence to support this practice, which has come under scrutiny in recent years. A recent systematic review published in 2018 included 5 studies investigating the role of dietary fiber modification during an acute flare. The 3 observational studies and 2 RCTs were all considered very low quality, but did not suggest a difference in clinical outcomes based on diet during treatment of acute diverticulitis.

### AGA clinical practice update on medical management of colonic diverticulitis: expert review [^1136QV4j]. Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) Clinical Practice Update — management principles and patient counseling: Whether patients should have a colonoscopy after an episode of diverticulitis depends on the patient's history, most recent colonoscopy, and disease severity and course, and in patients with a history of diverticulitis and chronic symptoms, alternative diagnoses should be excluded with both imaging and lower endoscopy. Antibiotic treatment can be used selectively, rather than routinely, in immunocompetent patients with mild acute uncomplicated diverticulitis, while antibiotic treatment is strongly advised in immunocompromised patients. To reduce the risk of recurrence, patients should consume a high-quality diet, have a normal body mass index, be physically active, not smoke, and avoid nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use except aspirin prescribed for secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease. Patients should be educated that the risk of complicated diverticulitis is highest with the first presentation, and an elective segmental resection should not be advised based on the number of episodes; instead, a discussion of elective segmental resection should be personalized to consider severity of disease, patient preferences and values, as well as risks and benefits. Rarely, a colon malignancy is misdiagnosed as diverticulitis.

The AGA suggests that colonoscopy be performed after resolution of acute diverticulitis in appropriate candidates to exclude the misdiagnosis of a colonic neoplasm if a high-quality examination of the colon has not been recently performed. The AGA suggests against elective colonic resection in patients with an initial episode of acute uncomplicated diverticulitis, and states that the decision to perform elective prophylactic colonic resection in this setting should be individualized. The AGA suggests a fiber-rich diet or fiber supplementation in patients with a history of acute diverticulitis. The AGA suggests against routinely advising patients with a history of diverticulitis to avoid consumption of seeds, nuts, and popcorn. The AGA suggests against routinely advising patients with a history of diverticulitis to avoid the use of aspirin. The AGA suggests advising patients with a history of diverticulitis to avoid the use of nonaspirin NSAIDs if possible. The AGA recommends against the use of mesalamine after acute uncomplicated diverticulitis. The AGA suggests against the use of rifaximin after acute uncomplicated diverticulitis. The AGA suggests against the use of probiotics after acute uncomplicated diverticulitis. The AGA suggests advising patients with diverticular disease to consider vigorous physical activity.

### Unmet needs in treatment of symptomatic uncomplicated diverticular disease and prevention of recurrent acute diverticulitis: a scoping review [^116FWaGC]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background:

Diverticular disease (DD) represents a common gastrointestinal condition that poses a heavy burden on healthcare systems worldwide. A high degree of uncertainty surrounds the therapeutic approaches for the control of symptoms in patients with symptomatic uncomplicated diverticular disease (SUDD) and primary and secondary prevention of diverticulitis and its consequences.

Objectives:

To review the current knowledge and discuss the unmet needs regarding the management of SUDD and the prevention of acute diverticulitis.

Eligibility criteria:

Randomized trials, observational studies, and systematic reviews on lifestyle/dietary interventions and medical treatment (rifaximin, mesalazine, and probiotics) of SUDD or prevention of acute diverticulitis.

Sources of evidence:

The literature search was performed from inception to April 2023, without language restriction, following the modified Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic review and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) reporting guidelines. References of the papers selected were checked to identify additional papers of potential interest. The final list of references was evaluated by a panel of experts, who were asked to check for any lack of relevant studies.

Charting methods:

Information on patient population, study design, intervention, control group, duration of the observation, and outcomes assessed was collected by two authors independently.

Results:

The review shows a high degree of uncertainty about therapeutic interventions, both dietary/lifestyle and pharmacological, in patients with SUDD, because of the scarcity and weakness of existing evidence. Available studies are generally of low quality, heterogeneous, and outdated, precluding the possibility to draw robust conclusions. Similarly, acute diverticulitis prevention has been seldom investigated, and there is a substantial lack of evidence supporting the role of dietary/lifestyle or pharmacological approaches to reduce the risk of diverticulitis.

Conclusion:

The lack of robust evidence regarding therapeutic options for gastrointestinal symptoms in SUDD patients and for primary and secondary prevention of acute diverticulitis remains an important unmet need in the management of DD.

### United States guidelines for diverticulitis treatment [^114jzNeW]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Guidelines for diverticular disease management were last supported and published by the American Gastroenterology Association and the American College of Gastroenterology 2 decades ago. Guidelines have been published in other countries and by some societies. These guidelines are suggested as United States of America guidelines. In reality, they are what is practiced in Connecticut at Yale New Haven hospitals. The epidemiology and pathophysiology is described. This is still considered a dietary fiber-deficiency disease that results in high intracolonic pressure with resultant outpocketing of diverticula in the weakest point of the colon at the sites of vascular penetration with developing elastin deposition in the colon wall. The age and gender distribution is described. They are most common in the sigmoid. The guidelines of management are described according to accepted classification of the disease at all stages from onset, to early formation, to mild disease, to complicated disease, to rare specific states. The outcomes and mortality are discussed.

### Progress and challenges in the management of diverticular disease: which treatment? [^113La7WC]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Current recommendations (Table 2) for this stage of the disease are nonspecific and unselected for all people and include dietary recommendations, such as a classically high-fiber diet. However, scientific evidence that supports this recommendation for the sole purpose of preventing symptoms is lacking, although it might be considered part of lifestyle changes that could offer other health benefits, such as smoking cessation, avoiding alcohol consumption, and regularly exercising. – Quality of evidence is rated as low, but a large cohort of 47,033 patients without a history of previous diverticulitis reported a 31% reduction in risk for incident hospitalization for diverticular disease in patients with a high-fiber diet (Figure 1). Evidence is lacking to support claims that a diet rich in nuts, popcorn, or seeds has a beneficial or a harmful effect, so these foods should not be categorically avoided or recommended.

Table 2.
Overall treatment recommendations in DDC.

Other measures suggested at this stage also encourage primary prevention and treatment of diabetes mellitus, which has been associated with a higher risk for symptomatic and complicated diverticular disease and colonic diverticular hemorrhage. Low levels of vitamin D, obesity and smoking should be avoided to prevent progression to symptomatic DDC and AD.

Symptomatic uncomplicated diverticular disease

SUDD is defined by the presence of nonspecific attacks of abdominal pain of a diverticular source without evidence of an inflammatory process and alteration in bowel habits. Pain is typically colic-like in nature, but can be constant, and is often relieved by passing flatus or with defecation. Other symptoms are diarrhea, constipation, bloating, and tenderness in the left lower quadrant or changes in bowel habits. This entity shares clinical similarities with irritable bowel syndrome, so it is sometimes difficult to distinguish them or attribute the symptoms to the presence of diverticula (see Table 1). Moreover, irritable bowel syndrome is 4.7-fold more likely in patients after an episode of AD than in controls, complicating the diagnosis even more. Laboratory diagnostic evaluation should be normal in patients with SUDD, but some data suggest that fecal calprotectin levels are higher in patients with SUDD compared with normal controls and patients with irritable bowel syndrome. These data need further confirmation because this biomarker might represent a way to differentiate the conditions.

### Updates in the understanding and management of diverticular disease [^114nP93w]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Diverticulosis leads to significant morbidity and mortality and is increasing in prevalence worldwide. In this paper, we review the clinical features, diagnosis, and management of diverticular disorders, followed by a discussion of recent updates and changes in the clinical approach to diverticular disease.

Recent Findings

Recent literature suggests that antibiotics are likely not necessary for low-risk patients with acute uncomplicated diverticulitis, and not all patients with recurrent diverticulitis require colectomy. Dietary restrictions do not prevent recurrent diverticulitis. Visceral hypersensitivity is increasingly being recognized as a cause of persistent abdominal pain after acute diverticulitis and should be considered along with chronic smoldering diverticulitis, segmental colitis associated with diverticula, and symptomatic uncomplicated diverticular disease.

Summary

Clinicians should be aware that traditionally held assumptions regarding the prevention and management of diverticular disorders have recently been called into question and should adjust their clinical practice accordingly.

### AGA clinical practice update on medical management of colonic diverticulitis: expert review [^111PGekX]. Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Colonic diverticulitis is a painful gastrointestinal disease that recurs unpredictably and can lead to chronic gastrointestinal symptoms. Gastroenterologists commonly care for patients with this disease. The purpose of this Clinical Practice Update is to provide practical and evidence-based advice for management of diverticulitis. We reviewed systematic reviews, meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials, and observational studies to develop 14 best practices. In brief, computed tomography is often necessary to make a diagnosis. Rarely, a colon malignancy is misdiagnosed as diverticulitis. Whether patients should have a colonoscopy after an episode of diverticulitis depends on the patient's history, most recent colonoscopy, and disease severity and course. In patients with a history of diverticulitis and chronic symptoms, alternative diagnoses should be excluded with both imaging and lower endoscopy. Antibiotic treatment can be used selectively rather than routinely in immunocompetent patients with mild acute uncomplicated diverticulitis. Antibiotic treatment is strongly advised in immunocompromised patients. To reduce the risk of recurrence, patients should consume a high-quality diet, have a normal body mass index, be physically active, not smoke, and avoid nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use except aspirin prescribed for secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease. At the same time, patients should understand that genetic factors also contribute to diverticulitis risk. Patients should be educated that the risk of complicated diverticulitis is highest with the first presentation. An elective segmental resection should not be advised based on the number of episodes. Instead, a discussion of elective segmental resection should be personalized to consider severity of disease, patient preferences and values, as well as risks and benefits.

### An unrestricted diet for uncomplicated diverticulitis is safe: results of a prospective diverticulitis diet study [^115m6K7H]. Colorectal Disease (2017). Low credibility.

Aim

The optimal diet for uncomplicated diverticulitis is unclear. Guidelines refrain from recommendation due to lack of objective information. The aim of the study was to determine whether an unrestricted diet during a first acute episode of uncomplicated diverticulitis is safe.

Method

A prospective cohort study was performed of patients diagnosed with diverticulitis for the first time between 2012 and 2014. Requirements for inclusion were radiologically proven modified Hinchey Ia/b diverticulitis, American Society of Anesthesiologists class I-III and the ability to tolerate an unrestricted diet. Exclusion criteria were the use of antibiotics and suspicion of inflammatory bowel disease or malignancy. All included patients were advised to take an unrestricted diet. The primary outcome parameter was morbidity. Secondary outcome measures were the development of recurrence and ongoing symptoms.

Results

There were 86 patients including 37 (43.0%) men. All patients were confirmed to have taken an unrestricted diet. There were nine adverse events in seven patients. These consisted of readmission for pain (five), recurrent diverticulitis (one) and surgery (three) for ongoing symptoms (two) and Hinchey Stage III (one). Seventeen (19.8%) patients experienced continuing symptoms 6 months after the initial episode and 4 (4.7%) experienced recurrent diverticulitis.

Conclusion

The incidence of complications among patients taking an unrestricted diet during an initial acute uncomplicated episode of diverticulitis was in line with that reported in the literature.

Membership survey results: Yes 744 (87.94%).

552 members (65.25%) agreed that this recommendation was already their current practice; 118 (13.95%) agreed that this recommendation was likely to change their practice while 176 (20.80%) disagreed that it was likely to change their practice.

Consensus was reached with no further voting.

Q3.3 What is the optimal follow - up following an episode of uncomplicated acute diverticulitis?

Statement: The use of 5-ASA agents does not prevent recurrent diverticulitis or improve chronic gastrointestinal symptoms after successful treatment for an episode of uncomplicated acute diverticulitis. The role of Rifaximin, probiotics, and fiber is less well defined.

Recommendation: Our expert group did not support the use of 5-ASA to prevent recurrent diverticulitis or improve chronic gastrointestinal symptoms among patients successfully treated for an episode of uncomplicated acute diverticulitis. (LoE: high. Strength of recommendation: strong).

Membership survey results: Yes 798 (96.49%).

606 members (73.28%) agreed that this recommendation was already their current practice; 105 (12.70%) agreed that this recommendation was likely to change their practice while 116 (14.03%) disagreed that it was likely to change their practice.

Consensus was reached with no further voting.

Q3.4 What is the role of interval endoscopy following an episode of acute diverticulitis?

Statement: In the absence of high-risk features, the detection rate for advanced adenomas or malignant lesions with colonic evaluation after an episode of uncomplicated acute diverticulitis is very low.

Recommendation: Our expert group recommends against routine colonic evaluation after successfully treated uncomplicated acute diverticulitis, unless high-risk features are present. (LoE: moderate. Strength of recommendation: weak).

Question 4 — dietary fiber in patients with a history of acute diverticulitis — The AGA suggests a fiber-rich diet or fiber supplementation in patients with a history of acute diverticulitis and characterizes this as a conditional recommendation with very low quality of evidence. There are no studies that address whether dietary or supplemental fiber intake reduces the risk of recurrent acute diverticulitis, and risk reduction for recurrent diverticulitis is extrapolated from a study examining patients without a prior history of diverticulitis. The benefits of fiber for chronic abdominal pain in patients with diverticulosis are inconsistent and do not necessarily imply benefit in terms of recurrent diverticulitis, and patient preferences and side effects of fiber such as abdominal bloating should be considered when counseling a patient.

### Unmet needs in treatment of symptomatic uncomplicated diverticular disease and prevention of recurrent acute diverticulitis: a scoping review [^112D4FZ4]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Another relevant outcome, acute diverticulitis prevention, has been scarcely studied. This would be an important issue since several epidemiological studies showed increasing acute diverticulitis incidence especially in Western countries.– At now, there are still no shared pharmacologic approaches for primary and secondary prevention of acute diverticulitis. Treatment interventions for reducing the risk of an acute episode are crucial, especially in the first 2 years after the acute event because of the greater incidence of recurrence registered in that period. While for mesalazine the existing literature shows proof of non-efficacy, for rifaximin there is evidence to suggest a hypothetical benefit. Thus, the management of patients with previous diverticulitis is still an important unmet need, as no clear conclusions can be drawn on treatment options in this context, due to the low quality and scarce evidence available.

Evidence suggesting the protective role of dietary and lifestyle factors (i.e. high-fiber diet, smoking cessation, body weight reduction, and physical activity promotion), on the risk of complicated DD comes only from epidemiological studies. Intervention studies assessing lifestyle factors in DD patients, an important area of interest, are currently unavailable. Since studies evaluating the effect of a high-fiber diet on pain reduction are of low quality and heterogeneous, it is not possible to draw a solid conclusion on the potential benefit of dietary or supplementary fiber in SUDD patients. Although there is a lack of intervention studies evaluating the effect of dietary and lifestyles, it is reasonable to believe that they may still be useful suggestions for preventing disease complications. However, the scarcity of solid evidence supporting dietary fiber and the lack of intervention studies evaluating lifestyle habits on DD certainly are among the unmet needs linked to SUDD management.

Fiber

Data on the role of fiber in primary prevention of diverticulitis are particularly conflicting. Patients with a history of diverticulosis or DD commonly seek dietary and lifestyle recommendations to reduce their risk of occurrence/recurrence of the disease and/or complications. The traditional recommendation has been to consume a high-fiber diet. Using data from a single case-control study that included 56 participants, it is estimated that a high-fiber diet might reduce the number of complications (by 52 cases per 1000 patients treated) and the need for surgery (by 100 cases per 1000 patients treated). Based on a prospective cohort study that examined the association of dietary fiber intake and risk of incident hospitalization for DD, it is estimated that a high-fiber diet may reduce the risk of acute diverticulitis by 59 cases per 1000 patients. We rated the quality of this evidence as very low based on substantial differences between our target population (those with a history of diverticulitis) and those in the cohort study (those without a history of diverticulitis). Only three randomized trials analyzed the role of fiber in preventing diverticulitis occurrence in those patients. Unfortunately, their sample size was far too small to demonstrate a significant effect of high-fiber supplementation on the prevention of acute uncomplicated diverticulitis or other complications of DD (e.g. abscess, perforation, stenosis, fistula or bleeding).

Concluding remarks

From honing in on specific dietary and genetic associations to refining surgical techniques, the complex landscape of diverticulitis is ever-changing. At a glance, there are more publications on quality of life and cost-effectiveness outcomes. These matters are particularly important as we attempt to become less aggressive in our care, so that we do not inadvertently promote chronic symptoms and recurrent disease in the name of "doing less". Patterns of treatment and societal guidelines remain significantly heterogeneous worldwide. We look forward to the longer-term results of trials from the last decade and ongoing innovation in the field.

### Paradigm shift: the copernican revolution in diverticular disease [^113r9ZWs]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Diverticular disease (DD) is an umbrella definition that includes different clinical conditions ranging from diverticulosis to severe and potentially life-threatening complications. In the last decade, new concepts regarding pathogenetic alterations have been developed, while the diagnostic, clinical and therapeutic approaches to the management of DD patients have changed. The protective role of dietary factors (i.e. fiber) has been questioned, whilst some drugs widely used in clinical practice have been found to have a deleterious effect. The use of antibiotics in all patients with acute uncomplicated diverticulitis was reconsidered, as well as the need for a surgical approach in these patients. Conflicting recommendations in different guidelines were proposed for the treatment of symptomatic uncomplicated DD. An endoscopic classification of DD was introduced, and a "curative" endoscopic approach has been pioneered. Based on these observations, which together amount to a kind of "Copernican revolution" in the management of DD patients, we performed a comprehensive and critical reappraisal of the proposed modifications, aiming to discriminate between certainties and doubts on this issue.

### Progress and challenges in the management of diverticular disease: which treatment? [^1121c4sT]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Diverticular disease of the colon (DDC) includes a spectrum of conditions from asymptomatic diverticulosis to symptomatic uncomplicated diverticulosis, segmental colitis associated with diverticulosis, and acute diverticulitis without or with complications that may have serious consequences. Clinical and scientific interest in DDC is increasing because of the rising incidence of all conditions within the DDC spectrum, a better, although still limited understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms involved; the increasing socioeconomic burden; and the new therapeutic options being tested. The goals of treatment in DDC are symptom and inflammation relief and preventing disease progression or recurrence. The basis for preventing disease progression remains a high-fiber diet and physical exercise, although evidence is poor. Other current strategies do not meet expectations or lack a solid mechanistic foundation; these strategies include modulation of gut microbiota or dysbiosis with rifaximin or probiotics, or using mesalazine for low-grade inflammation in uncomplicated symptomatic diverticulosis. Most acute diverticulitis is uncomplicated, and the trend is to avoid hospitalization and unnecessary antibiotic therapy, but patients with comorbidities, sepsis, or immunodeficiency should receive broad spectrum and appropriate antibiotics. Complicated acute diverticulitis may require interventional radiology or surgery, although the best surgical approach (open versus laparoscopic) remains a matter of discussion. Prevention of acute diverticulitis recurrence remains undefined, as do therapeutic strategies. Mesalazine with or without probiotics has failed to prevent diverticulitis recurrence, whereas new studies are needed to validate preliminary positive results with rifaximin. Surgery is another option, but the number of acute events cannot guide this indication. We need to identify risk factors and disease progression or recurrence mechanisms to implement appropriate preventive strategies.

### WSES consensus conference: guidelines for first-line management of intra-abdominal infections [^113ngLXg]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Non-operative treatment, with bowel rest and antibiotics, is suggested in patients with uncomplicated diverticulitis (Recommendation 1 C).

Conservative treatment of acute uncomplicated diverticulitis is successful in 70 to 100 percent of patients. Uncomplicated diverticulitis may be managed as an outpatient (dietary modification and oral antibiotics) for those without appreciable fever, excessive vomiting, or marked peritonitis, as long as there is the opportunity for follow-up. The patient should be able to take liquids and antibiotics by mouth. Hospitalization is indicated if the patient is unable to take liquids or has severe pain, or if symptoms fail to improve despite adequate outpatient therapy. Antibiotics should be selected to treat the most common bacteria found in the colon: gram-negative rods and anaerobic bacteria. Non-operative treatment will resolve acute diverticulitis in 85 percent of patients, but approximately one-third will have a recurrent attack often within one year.

The decision to recommend elective sigmoid colectomy after recovery from acute diverticulitis should be made on a case-by-case basis (Recommendation 1 C).

The overall rate of recurrence appears to be approximately 10 to 30% within a decade after a first documented attack and that the majority of patients who have a single episode of diverticulitis will not have another. In one report involving an average follow-up of 9 years with 2551 patients whose initial episode of diverticulitis was treated successfully without surgery, only 13% had recurrent attacks and only 7% required colectomy. These observations imply that routine elective colectomy is probably unwarranted if the disease is successfully managed on initial presentation and that surgical treatment should be limited to patients whose symptoms persist despite conservative therapy. Thus, continued observation may be appropriate for most patients who have repeated attacks of uncomplicated diverticulitis.

### Management of colonic diverticular disease with poorly absorbed antibiotics and other therapies [^1176Ey64]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Colonic diverticular disease is common in Western countries and its prevalence increases with age. The large majority of patients (80–85%) will remain entirely asymptomatic throughout their life. In symptomatic cases, most patients will have diverticulosis without inflammation while the remainder will have diverticulitis with or without complications. About 1–2% will require hospitalization and 0.5% will require surgery. Factors predicting the development of symptoms remain to be identified. However, it is generally recognized that diverticular disease is probably related to complex interactions between colon structure, intestinal motility, diet, and genetic features. Epidemiologic studies have demonstrated an association between diverticulosis and diets that are low in fiber and high in refined carbohydrates. Although the causes of symptom development are still unclear, it is thought that previous episodes of intestinal inflammation may play a role. Changes in intestinal microflora could be one of the putative mechanisms responsible for low-grade inflammation. In patients with uncomplicated diverticulosis, a diet abundant in fruit and vegetables is recommended. The current therapeutic approaches in preventing recurrence of symptoms are based on nonabsorbable antibiotics, mesalazine, and/or probiotics. Cyclic rifaximin administration seems to be an adequate approach to relieving symptoms and preventing acute diverticulitis in patients with symptomatic diverticulosis.

What are the aims of treatment?

As mentioned above, the clinical spectrum of colonic diverticular disease is wide and ranges from asymptomatic diverticula to SUDD, uncomplicated diverticulitis and eventually, complicated diverticulitis. Therefore, the management, and the therapeutic approach are different, depending on the severity of the disease. Overall, prevention of progression, treatment of active disease and prevention of recurrence are the three key aims of treatment in any clinical manifestation of diverticular disease.

Asymptomatic diverticulosis does not need any pharmacologic treatment. However, healthy lifestyle (regular physical exercise, maintaining ideal body weight, abstention from smoking) and high-fiber diet are recommended to prevent its progression to SUDD and its complications. Most people with diverticulosis will not progress to symptomatic disease. The proportion of subjects with diverticulosis that eventually develop SUDD or acute diverticulitis is unknown. Consensus papers and reviews, state that 80–85% of subjects with diverticulosis will remain asymptomatic throughout their life, whereas 15–20% of symptomatic patients will suffer from diverticular disease without inflammation, while the remainder will have diverticulitis. However, estimates of progression need to be based on more reliable studies. One studyidentified 2222 patients with baseline diverticulosis. Over an 11-year follow-up period, 95 patients developed diverticulitis (4.3%; 6 per 1000 patient-years). The median time to event was 7.1 years.

Pharmacological treatment of SUDD should reduce intensity and frequency of symptoms and prevent the progression to diverticulitis, (Table 2). Most symptoms in SUDD are mild to moderate but they impair the patients' quality of life. Typical symptoms of SUDD include pain (in the lower or left lower quadrant of the abdomen), bloating and changes in bowel habits, symptoms also observed in patients with IBS; a differential diagnosis between these two clinical entities should therefore be attempted.

Table 2.
Aims of therapy in symptomatic uncomplicated diverticular disease.

Progression to diverticulitis is uncommon and often benign. One prospective, long-term study, assessing the development of complications in patients with SUDD, pointed out that 97% of patients had mild or no symptoms after a median follow-up of 66 months. Acute diverticulitis appeared in only 2.5% of cases.

Figure 3 depicts current treatment options for this condition and the pathogenic basis underlying these options. Use of fiber has been a mainstay of SUDD treatment despite a weak evidence base for this practice. In addition, the literature offers no strong guidance regarding type, (e.g. soluble fiber which mainly bulks stool by drawing fluid/water into stool residues, or insoluble fiber which increases bacterial fermentation and accelerates colonic transit time, as well as increasing biomass and inducing changes in colonic pH and intestinal microbiome)and quantity of fiber needed, although in SUDD the insoluble fibers can sometimes worsen symptoms by increasing bloating and flatulence, as happens in irritable bowel syndrome.

Figure 3.
Algorithm defining current therapeutic strategies for symptomatic uncomplicated diverticular disease (SUDD). Evidence is very poor, supporting the use of fiber or spasmolitics. Evidence is also limited for the use of other compounds, but rifaximin has been shown to reduce symptoms and reduces the risk of development of acute diverticulitis, whereas mesalazine use is controversial, since it was found not to relive symptoms or prevent acute diverticulitis in some studies, although a recent meta-analysis shows that it can be effective for both outcomes. –,

Data on the use of fiber as a unique treatment for SUDD are ambiguous, but fiber is still recommended, – complemented by other compounds such as cyclic rifaximin (400 mg/12 h for 7 days per month), a combination that is 29% more effective than placebo for symptom relief at 1 year; the number needed to treat for this benefit was 3. – Based on three open and two double-blind randomized clinical trials, one systematic review, and two meta-analyses, the Italian Consensus conferenceconcluded that fiber plus rifaximin leads more patients to be symptom free compared with fiber alone and that rifaximin plus fiber is more effective than fiber alone in preventing AD, with a low therapeutic advantage.

The use of rifaximin is based on the hypothesis that disturbances in the intestinal microbiota might predispose patients to inflammation and excessive production of intestinal gas that eventually induces symptoms. Rifaximin is a nonabsorbable antibiotic with broad-spectrum activity that decreases the metabolic activity of intestinal flora, increases fecal mass, and reduces bacterial overgrowth. Its safety and tolerability are high because of its very low absorption rates, which implies that nonenteric pathogens are not exposed to selective pressure and the risk of bacterial resistance.

### Management of diverticular disease [^113pSRdw]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2015). Medium credibility.

Diverticular disease is a common condition in Western countries and the incidence and prevalence of the disease is increasing. The pathogenetic factors involved include structural changes in the gut that increase with age, a diet low in fibre and rich in meat, changes in intestinal motility, the concept of enteric neuropathy and an underlying genetic background. Current treatment strategies are hampered by insufficient options to stratify patients according to individual risk. One of the main reasons is the lack of an all-encompassing classification system of diverticular disease. In response, the German Society for Gastroenterology and Digestive Diseases (DGVS) has proposed a classification system as part of its new guideline for the diagnosis and management of diverticular disease. The classification system includes five main types of disease: asymptomatic diverticulosis, acute uncomplicated and complicated diverticulitis, as well as chronic diverticular disease and diverticular bleeding. Here, we review prevention and treatment strategies stratified by these five main types of disease, from prevention of the first attack of diverticulitis to the management of chronic complications and diverticular bleeding.

AGA Clinical Practice Update on medical management of colonic diverticulitis — conclusions state that colonic diverticulitis is a painful disease that occurs unpredictably; although most patients never experience a perforation or abscess, uncomplicated recurrences are a burden to patients and many worry about recurrence, perforation, and need for surgery. Gastroenterologists can alleviate many of these concerns by making an accurate diagnosis, addressing chronic sequelae, and educating patients on risk factors, prognosis, and indications for surgery. Although the advice in this document is based on low- to moderate-quality evidence, research is ongoing and has the potential to eventually identify better options for diverticulitis treatment and prevention.

### Routine colonoscopy may be needed for uncomplicated acute right colonic diverticulitis [^116YFoUs]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The prevalence of diverticular disease has increased, both the in East and West, due to a lack of dietary fiber intake. In contrast to complicated diverticulitis, which requires surgical treatment, uncomplicated acute diverticulitis can improve with conservative management, with colonoscopy recommended to identify accompanying disease, such as cancer. Yet, a review article reported a low rate of cancer diagnosis during colonoscopy surveillance in patients treated for uncomplicated diverticulitis, with 1 case of cancer among the 67 cases included in the analysis. However, these statistics are based solely on cases with left colon diverticulitis and only small number of patients (67 patients) were included. As such, the likelihood of cancer among patients treated with uncomplicated right colon diverticulitis is unknown. This knowledge, however, would be important as right-sided colon diverticulitis tends to occur at a younger age than left-sided colon diverticulitis, with a low stage Hinchey classification being common on computed tomography (CT). Generally, the American Cancer Society guideline recommends colonoscopy surveillance to begin at the age of 45 years. Moreover, the onset of colon cancer at a younger age is more likely to occur in the left than right colon. Considering these points, it is unclear how routine colonoscopy evaluation after right colon diverticulitis could be of clinical benefit with regard to diagnostic performance and economic burden.

Of the literature published on the effects of routine colonoscopy after the treatment of uncomplicated colon diverticulitis, few articles have exclusively included patients with right colon diverticulitis. Thus, the aim of our study was to evaluate the incidence of right colon cancer and colonic adenomatous polyps by routine colonoscopy, after conservative management of acute uncomplicated right colon diverticulitis.

Results

Four major questions regarding the management of DD were identified (Table 1). The literature search initially identified 361 papers, of which 62 were considered pertinent to address the PICO questions.

Dietary and lifestyle interventions in patients with SUDD without previous diverticulitis

Two systematic reviews have investigated the role of fibers in SUDD. A systematic review published in 2017included 19 studies: 9 regarding the intake of dietary fibers and 10 with fiber supplementation. Individual studies suggested that fibers, both dietary and supplemental, may provide a benefit in SUDD, but the quality of the studies was very low, with only one study having an optimal score according to the Jadad scale.

As for studies on dietary fibers, only one trial was double-blind, therapeutic regimens were heterogeneous (i.e. dietary fibers, crispbread, high residue, low sugar with unprocessed bran), the amount of dietary fiber utilized was variable (from 20 to 96 g/day), and control groups were also heterogeneous (i.e. symbiotic preparations, rifaximin, lactulose, not high-fiber diet). The follow-up ranged from 3 to 65 months.

### What do we know about diverticular disease? A brief overview [^113ToEQR]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2006). Low credibility.

Diverticulosis and its complications, particularly diverticulitis, are extremely common in western countries. The major factor in the development of diverticulosis is a lack of adequate fiber intake. Diverticulitis may be complicated by abscess formation, fistula formation, peritonitis, or obstruction. Computed tomography scans are highly useful tools to plan appropriate care. Most cases of simple, uncomplicated diverticulitis respond to conservative therapy with bowel rest and antibiotics. Many controversies remain in the care of diverticulitis patients, including the optimal timing of surgery. One particularly interesting area of recent research examines the overlap of diverticulitis and inflammatory bowel disease, including the use of probiotics and mesalamine in diverticular disease.

### Epidemiology, pathophysiology, and treatment of diverticulitis [^113NWVLs]. Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Diverticulitis is a prevalent gastrointestinal disorder that is associated with significant morbidity and health care costs. Approximately 20% of patients with incident diverticulitis have at least 1 recurrence. Complications of diverticulitis, such as abdominal sepsis, are less likely to occur with subsequent events. Several risk factors, many of which are modifiable, have been identified including obesity, diet, and physical inactivity. Diet and lifestyle factors could affect risk of diverticulitis through their effects on the intestinal microbiome and inflammation. Preliminary studies have found that the composition and function of the gut microbiome differ between individuals with vs without diverticulitis. Genetic factors, as well as alterations in colonic neuromusculature, can also contribute to the development of diverticulitis. Less-aggressive and more-nuanced treatment strategies have been developed. Two multicenter, randomized trials of patients with uncomplicated diverticulitis found that antibiotics did not speed recovery or prevent subsequent complications. Elective surgical resection is no longer recommended solely based on number of recurrent events or young patient age and might not be necessary for some patients with diverticulitis complicated by abscess. Randomized trials of hemodynamically stable patients who require urgent surgery for acute, complicated diverticulitis that has not improved with antibiotics provide evidence to support primary anastomosis vs sigmoid colectomy with end colostomy. Despite these advances, more research is needed to increase our understanding of the pathogenesis of diverticulitis and to clarify treatment algorithms.

### Modern concepts in diverticular disease [^116D9Ttv]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Over the last decade there has been a striking shift in our understanding of the epidemiology, pathology, and management of diverticular disease. Indeed, many of the guidelines published in the late nineties and early 2000s are now redundant. High-fiber diets, avoidance of nuts and seeds, antibiotic treatment for mild diverticulitis, elective resection after 2 attacks of diverticulitis, Hartmann's procedure (HP), and aggressive management of young patients are all open to question. The more we challenge our understanding of diverticulitis it becomes apparent how little we know about this disease entity. This review aims update the reader on current hypotheses and evidencebased modern management strategies in diverticular disease.

Foods not linked to increased risk include that "Nut, corn, and popcorn consumption is not associated with an increased risk of diverticulitis", and "consuming fruits with small seeds (strawberries and blueberries) is not associated with increased risk". Activity and adiposity also matter: "Physical activity, particularly when it is vigorous, decreases risk", while "Obesity, particularly central obesity, weight gain, and smoking are also risk factors", and "Alcoholism, but not alcohol consumption by itself, increases risk as well".

Acute diverticulitis is a common condition that has been increasing in incidence in the United States. It is associated with increasing age, but the pathophysiology of acute diverticulitis is still being elucidated. It is now believed to have a significant contribution from inflammatory processes rather than being a strictly infectious process. There are still many questions to be answered regarding the optimal management of acute diverticulitis because recent studies have challenged traditional practices, such as the routine use of antibiotics, surgical technique, and dietary restrictions for prevention of recurrence.

### Fibers and polyphenols in diverticular disease: from pathophysiology to management [^1164srfS]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2025). Medium credibility.

Backgrounds

Diverticular disease, particularly symptomatic uncomplicated diverticular disease (SUDD), significantly impacts patient quality of life and is increasing in prevalence, especially in Western countries. While its pathophysiology is multifactorial, diet-specifically low fiber intake-has been implicated as a key modifiable factor in disease development and progression. Fibers influence colonic motility and stool composition, potentially reducing the formation of diverticula and symptom severity. Polyphenols, bioactive compounds with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, may further protect intestinal integrity and modulate gut microbiota.

Purpose

This narrative review explores emerging evidence on the role of dietary fiber and polyphenols in SUDD management. Despite promising mechanistic insights, current studies are limited by heterogeneity and methodological constraints. Personalized nutritional strategies focusing on fiber and polyphenol-rich foods warrant further investigation to optimize therapeutic outcomes in SUDD.

### Diverticular disease: rapid evidence review [^116Wjddp]. American Family Physician (2022). Medium credibility.

Diverticulitis should be suspected in patients with isolated left lower quadrant pain, abdominal distention or rigidity, fever, and leukocytosis. Initial laboratory workup includes a complete blood count, basic metabolic panel, urinalysis, and C-reactive protein measurement. Computed tomography with intravenous contrast is the preferred imaging modality, if needed to confirm diagnosis and assess for complications of diverticulitis. Treatment decisions are based on the categorization of disease as complicated vs. uncomplicated. Selected patients with uncomplicated diverticulitis may be treated without antibiotics. Complicated diverticulitis is treated in the hospital with modified diet or bowel rest, antibiotics, and pain control. Abscesses that are 3 cm or larger should be treated with percutaneous drainage. Emergent surgery is reserved for when percutaneous drainage fails or the patient's clinical condition worsens despite adequate therapy. Colonoscopy should not be performed during the flare-up, but should be considered six weeks after resolution of symptoms in patients with complicated diverticulitis who have not had a high-quality colonoscopy in the past year. Diverticulitis prevention measures include consuming a vegetarian diet or high-quality diet (high in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and legumes), limiting red meat and sweets, achieving or maintaining a body mass index of 18 to 25 kg per m², being physically active, and avoiding tobacco and long-term nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Partial colectomy is not routinely recommended for diverticulitis prevention and should be reserved for patients with more than three recurrences or abscess formation requiring percutaneous drainage.

### Emerging evidence and recent controversies in diverticulitis: a 5-year review [^114KMZrF]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Diverticulitis is a common gastrointestinal disease that still garners significant attention and study because of its heterogeneity in presentation and outcome. We provide a review of the newest and most controversial topics in diverticulitis. Recent discoveries on the influence of diet and other environmental risk factors are discussed, showing how the epidemiology of the disease process is shifting away from what was previously felt to be a disorder primarily limited to older western populations. Interestingly, as has long been suspected, genetic mutations and variations associated with the development of diverticulitis are being discovered and are summarized here. The data for non-operative and outpatient management of diverticulitis are reviewed, as are pharmacologic agents studied for use in the secondary prevention of diverticulitis. Lastly, we present controversies in the surgical treatment of diverticulitis. This review will provide a synopsis of the last 5 years of literature relating to diverticulitis.

### Systematic review of evidence and consensus on diverticulitis: an analysis of national and international guidelines [^112H69fh]. Colorectal Disease (2014). Low credibility.

Aim

The study aimed to analyse the currently available national and international guidelines for areas of consensus and contrasting recommendations in the treatment of diverticulitis and thereby to design questions for future research.

Method

MEDLINE, EMBASE and PubMed were systematically searched for guidelines on diverticular disease and diverticulitis. Inclusion was confined to papers in English and those < 10 years old. The included topics were classified as consensus or controversy between guidelines, and the highest level of evidence was scored as sufficient (Oxford Centre of Evidence-Based Medicine Level of Evidence of 3a or higher) or insufficient.

Results

Six guidelines were included and all topics with recommendations were compared. Overall, in 13 topics consensus was reached and 10 topics were regarded as controversial. In five topics, consensus was reached without sufficient evidence and in three topics there was no evidence and no consensus. Clinical staging, the need for intraluminal imaging, dietary restriction, duration of antibiotic treatment, the protocol for abscess treatment, the need for elective surgery in subgroups of patients, the need for surgery after abscess treatment and the level of the proximal resection margin all lack consensus or evidence.

Conclusion

Evidence on the diagnosis and treatment of diverticular disease and diverticulitis ranged from nonexistent to strong, regardless of consensus. The most relevant research questions were identified and proposed as topics for future research.

### Diverticular disease: diagnosis and treatment [^115zU3KP]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Diverticular disease refers to symptomatic and asymptomatic disease with an underlying pathology of colonic diverticula. Predisposing factors for the formation of diverticula include a low-fiber diet and physical inactivity. Approximately 85 percent of patients with diverticula are believed to remain asymptomatic. Symptomatic disease without inflammation is a diagnosis of exclusion requiring colonoscopy because imaging studies cannot discern the significance of diverticula. Fiber supplementation may prevent progression to symptomatic disease or improve symptoms in patients without inflammation. Computed tomography is recommended for diagnosis when inflammation is present. Antibiotic therapy aimed at anaerobes and gram-negative rods is first-line treatment for diverticulitis. Whether treatment is administered on an inpatient or outpatient basis is determined by the clinical status of the patient and his or her ability to tolerate oral intake. Surgical consultation is indicated for disease that does not respond to medical management or for repeated attacks that may be less likely to respond to medical therapy and have a higher mortality rate. Prompt surgical consultation also should be obtained when there is evidence of abscess formation, fistula formation, obstruction, or free perforation.

### Diverticular disease: evolving concepts in classification, presentation, and management [^115RuJLi]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Diverticular disease is the most commonly reported finding at the time of colonoscopy and one of the most common gastrointestinal indications for hospitalization. Much of our previous understanding of diverticular disease has recently been challenged.

Recent Findings

There is emerging evidence that the long-accepted hypothesis of diverticulosis as a consequence of fiber deficiency may be more complex than commonly thought, with recent evidence suggesting that high-fiber diet and frequent bowel movements are associated with a greater and not lower prevalence of diverticular disease. There is also emerging support for the concept of low-grade inflammation in symptomatic uncomplicated diverticular disease (SUDD), and the role of anti-inflammatory treatment with mesalamine is being actively investigated. Additionally, elective 'prophylactic' surgery after diverticulitis, previously considered after a second confirmed diverticulitis episode, is being increasingly deferred.

Summary

The pathogenesis of diverticular disease is likely multifactorial and complex. More studies are needed to evaluate the role of fiber in the pathogenesis and treatment of diverticular disease. The search for an effective medical therapy for SUDD and to prevent recurrent diverticulitis is being actively investigated. The efficacy of mesalamine does not appear to be strong data supported.

### Diverticulitis: a review [^115hsLFY]. JAMA (2025). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Diverticulosis is defined by the presence of multiple outpouchings (diverticula) originating from the intestinal lumen. Diverticulitis is defined as inflammation of these diverticula. The annual incidence of diverticulitis in the US is approximately 180 per 100 000 people, resulting in approximately 200 000 hospital admissions annually and an estimated health care expenditure of more than $6.3 billion/year.

Observations

Risk factors for diverticular disease include age older than 65 years, genetic factors such as variant in the tumor necrosis factor superfamily member 15 (TNFSFI5) gene; connective tissue diseases such as polycystic kidney disease, Marfan syndrome, or Ehlers-Danlos syndrome; body mass index 30 or greater; use of opioids, steroids, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications; hypertension; and type 2 diabetes. Approximately 1% to 4% of patients with diverticulosis will develop acute diverticulitis in their lifetime, which typically presents as left lower quadrant pain associated with nausea, vomiting, fever, and leukocytosis. A contrast-enhanced abdominal and pelvic computed tomography scan is the recommended diagnostic test and has a sensitivity of 98% to 99% and specificity of 99% to 100%. Approximately 85% of people with acute diverticulitis have uncomplicated diverticulitis (absence of abscess, colon strictures, colon perforation, or fistula formation). Management of patients with uncomplicated diverticulitis consists of observation with pain management (typically acetaminophen) and dietary modification with a clear liquid diet. Antibiotics should be reserved for patients with systemic symptoms such as persistent fever or chills, those with increasing leukocytosis, those older than 80 years, those who are pregnant, those who are immunocompromised (receiving chemotherapy, or high-dose steroids, or have received an organ transplant), and those with chronic medical conditions (such as cirrhosis, chronic kidney disease, heart failure, or poorly controlled diabetes). First-line antibiotics consist of oral amoxicillin/clavulanic acid or cefalexin with metronidazole. For patients who cannot tolerate oral intake, intravenous antibiotic therapy (ie, cefuroxime or ceftriaxone plus metronidazole or ampicillin/sulbactam) is appropriate. Complicated diverticulitis is managed with intravenous antibiotics such as ceftriaxone plus metronidazole or piperacillin-tazobactam and additional invasive management as indicated (ie, percutaneous drainage of associated intra-abdominal abscess or colon resection). Patients with generalized peritonitis should undergo emergent laparotomy with colonic resection. Postoperative mortality for diverticulitis managed electively or emergently is 0.5% for elective colon resection and 10.6% for emergent colon resection.

Conclusions and Relevance

In the US, diverticulitis affects approximately 180 per 100 000 people annually. For uncomplicated diverticulitis, first-line therapy is observation and pain control, and antibiotics should be initiated for patients with persistent fevers, increasing leukocytosis, sepsis or septic shock, advanced age, pregnancy, immunocompromise, and certain chronic medical conditions. Treatment of complicated diverticulitis includes intravenous antibiotics, such as ceftriaxone plus metronidazole or piperacillin-tazobactam, and, if indicated, percutaneous drainage of abscess or resection of diseased segment of colon.

Which drugs are effective?

In addition to fibers (both high-fiber diet and dietary supplements), the therapeutic armamentarium in diverticular disease relies on antibiotics, and more recently the poorly absorbed antibiotic rifaximin, mesalazine and probiotics, alone, or in combination.

In asymptomatic diverticulosis, the prevention of progression to symptomatic disease or acute diverticulitis has been attempted with high-fiber intake and exercise, albeit with poor scientific evidence. No drug therapy is recommended at this stage. A meta-analysis of four RCTs (of which only one was placebo-controlled) showed that in patients with SUDD, rifaximin, in addition to soluble or insoluble fibers, is effective in reducing symptoms compared with fiber alone(Figure 8). The best results were obtained using a combination of soluble fibers, such as glucomannan (a soluble fiber extracted from the root of the konjac plant, able to absorb up to 200 times its weight in water), and rifaximin (given for 1 week every month).

Figure 8.
Efficacy of rifaximin for symptom relief in symptomatic uncomplicated diverticular disease: meta-analysis of randomized-controlled trials (from Bianchi et al.).

CI, confidence interval; NNT, number needed to treat; RD, rate difference.

Mesalazine, an anti-inflammatory and antioxidant agent, has been used in patients with SUDD. In a recent systematic review, symptom relief with mesalazine was better than placebo, high-fiber diet, and low-dose rifaximin. The incidence of diverticulitis with mesalazine was lower only when compared with placebo(Table 4). Every-day mesalazine may be better than cyclic administration to prevent relapse. The combination of cyclic mesalazine and Lactobacillus casei DG seems to be better than placebo for maintaining remission of SUDD, but the small size of the study requires confirmation.

### Unmet needs in treatment of symptomatic uncomplicated diverticular disease and prevention of recurrent acute diverticulitis: a scoping review [^1112iBpP]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

In addition, a further double-blind placebo-controlled RCT not included in the previous systematic review, included 120 SUDD patients treated for 3 months with (i) supplementation of Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Enterococcus faecium, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Lactobacillus plantarum (1 ml/kg/day) or (ii) placebo. Alteration of bowel habits (constipation, diarrhea), mucorrhea, and back pain were significantly reduced in patients supplemented with probiotics, but the reduction of abdominal pain was similar between groups.

A reduction in abdominal swelling and pain in subjects with SUDD is associated with the use of L. acidophilus, Lactobacillus helveticus, and Bifidobacterium spp. 420 or Lactobacillus paracasei has been documented in non-randomized studiesor small RCTs.

Overall, the evidence supporting the role of probiotics in SUDD is based on small, heterogeneous studies, of generally poor methodological quality. Furthermore, existing studies were mainly focused on symptoms, and there is a substantial lack of information regarding the possible role of probiotics in reducing the risk of diverticulitis.

Dietary and lifestyle interventions in patients with previous diverticulitis with or without GI symptoms

Evidence regarding the role of fiber intake in preventing the recurrence of diverticulitis is scant.

In 2018, a systematic review identified three studies in which dietary fiber intake was modified after an acute episode of uncomplicated diverticulitis. Although all three studies reported data on symptoms and two out of three on diverticulitis relapses, the absence in two studies of a control group taking a low-fiber diet precluded the possibility of performing a meta-analysis. Furthermore, one of the randomized trials consideredcompared fiber supplement versus fiber supplement + rifaximin, precluding the unbiased assessment of the role of fiber supplementation. Overall, the strength of evidence for the possible role of fiber in preventing recurrence was considered by the authors as 'very low'.

No additional, more recent studies were identified. No lifestyle intervention studies for the prevention of recurrence of diverticulitis (type of diet, BMI, physical activity, smoking) were identified. However, we can assume that the beneficial effect of dietary fiber and lifestyle intervention reported in observational studies in patients without previous diverticulitis [increase in physical activity, weight loss in case of overweight or obesity, smoking cessation, avoiding Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drug (NSAIDs)] can be successfully applied to patients who have had acute diverticulitis to reduce diverticulitis recurrence.

### WSES guidelines for the management of acute left sided colonic diverticulitis in the emergency setting [^114v6zAz]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

In immunocompromised patients antibiotics with a broader-spectrum should be used. No studies have examined the value of dietary restriction or bed rest.
9) Outpatient management is suggested for patients with uncomplicated acute diverticulitis, with no comorbidities. These patients should be clinically monitored as outpatients and re-evaluated within 7 days to assess for resolution of the inflammatory processes. Earlier revaluation is necessary if the clinical condition deteriorates (Recommendation 1 B).

Patients with uncomplicated diverticulitis symptoms without significant comorbidities, who are able to take fluids orally and manage themselves at home, can be treated as outpatients. They should be re-evaluated within 7 days. However if the clinical condition deteriorates, re-evaluation should be carried out earlier. Patients with significant comorbidities and unable to take fluids orally should be treated in hospital with intravenous fluid.

Etzioni et al. in 2010 published a retrospective analysis, demonstrating that outpatient treatment was effective for the vast majority (94%) of patients suffering from acute diverticulitis. A systematic review on outpatient management of acute uncomplicated diverticulitis was recently published in 2014. Jackson et al. concluded that current evidence suggested that a more progressive, ambulatory-based approach to the majority of cases of acute uncomplicated diverticulitis was justified. Rodríguez-Cerrillo et al. have recently shown that elderly patients with co-morbidities can be safely treated at home avoiding hospital admission.

The DIVER trial has recently demonstrated that outpatient treatment may be safe and effective in selected patients with uncomplicated acute diverticulitis and can reduces the costs without negatively influencing the quality of life of these patients. This multicenter, randomized controlled trial included patients older than 18 years with acute uncomplicated diverticulitis. All the patients underwent abdominal CT. The first dose of antibiotic was given intravenously to all patients in the emergency department and then patients were either admitted to hospital or discharged. Among a total of 132 patients, four patients in those admitted to hospital and three patients in those discharged to home management developed treatment failure (there was no differences between the groups (P = 0.62). The overall health care cost per episode was 3 times less in the outpatient treated group, with significant costs savings of €1124.70 per patient. No differences were observed between the groups in terms of quality of life.

### The Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland consensus guidelines in emergency colorectal surgery [^117Gdktu]. Colorectal Disease (2021). Medium credibility.

Treatment with mesalazine, rifaximin or probiotics has not been found to prevent recurrent episodes of diverticulitis or even control persistent symptoms after an episode of AD. An increase in dietary fibre or supplemental fibre is widely accepted to be of benefit for general health and should be recommended, but there is little evidence that it reduces current symptoms or recurrence of symptoms. Patients should be provided with written advice on discharge.

Question 1.8

Which patients with acute diverticulitis should be considered for laparoscopic lavage?

Recommendation: Laparoscopic lavage is currently not recommended for treatment of complicated acute diverticulitis but may be an acceptable alternative to avoid major resection in high risk patients provided its limitations are communicated to patients.

Level of evidence: I

Grade of recommendation: A

Consensus: 100% (SA 55.6%, A 44.4%)

Perforation associated with AD represents 75% of diverticular emergencies requiring surgery. Complementary to estimates of inflammatory parameters and CT findings, good decision‐making and clinical judgement determine the need for surgery, depending upon the patient's clinical status, comorbidities, immunosuppression, signs of peritonitis and sepsis.

### Progress and challenges in the management of diverticular disease: which treatment? [^116aTYw2]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Prevention of recurrence following an episode of AD

After one episode of AD, 15–30% of patients will develop a recurrent episode, although a recent large population-based cohort study reported a lower 11.2% recurrence rate of hospital admission, lower than previously reported, which seems greater in women and younger people. The second episode carries another 30% risk of having a third event, but the first episode seems the most severe. Patients also present often chronic abdominal pain after an AD event that may be difficult to manage. Although quality evidence is still insufficient to identify the best preventive treatment, several secondary prevention strategies have been suggested and include a high-fiber diet, cyclic antibiotic treatment with rifaximin, probiotics, mesalazine treatment, and avoiding NSAIDs. The role of surgery is discussed below (Table 4).

### EAES and SAGES 2018 consensus conference on acute diverticulitis management: evidence-based recommendations for clinical practice [^111DkAVQ]. Surgical Endoscopy (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The objective of this international DCC was to generate an updated review and evidence-based recommendations that could provide valuable guidance to our members, particularly acute care surgeons, on this common surgical problem for which the management has radically changed in the last 10 years. In this first collaborative project, we successfully engaged the wider membership of EAES and SAGES in order to ensure that the final output would reflect participants' opinions, be relevant across both Societies' diverse membership, and help bridge existing gaps in clinical practice upon evidence-based principles. Although a number of AD guidelines have been reported by national and specialty societies, significant discrepancies have resulted in differing levels of uptake and subsequent widespread variations in practice. Involving the members of both societies, the DCC achieved broader consensus beyond that of an expert panel, ensuring relevance and applicability to clinical practice, with the hope of increasing adoption and unifying clinical practice for the benefit of our patients.

Through this effort, six systematic reviews of the contemporary evidence related to the epidemiology, diagnosis and classification of acute diverticulitis, elective and emergency treatment of uncomplicated and complicated acute diverticulitis were generated. These comprehensive reviews (presented in the supplementary materials) underpinned 51 consensus statements and 41 recommendations generated by the international steering group. The level of membership participation from both societies exceeded our expectations with over 1000 online survey responses and 300 audience members from both congresses actively engaged to reshape the final statements and recommendations.

Consensus was achieved on most of the recommendations which were also reported as likely to impact or change the clinical practice for participants not already applying them. This is perhaps not surprising as high-level evidence is now available for many acute diverticulitis topics and underpinned the basis of each statement and linked recommendation developed by this conference.

### Recent advances in the treatment of colonic diverticular disease and prevention of acute diverticulitis [^114aXoZu]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

The incidence of diverticulosis and diverticular disease of the colon is increasing worldwide. Although the majority of patients remains asymptomatic long-life, the prevalence of diverticular disease of the colon, including acute diverticulitis, is substantial and is becoming a significant burden on National Health Systems in terms of direct and indirect costs. Focus is now being drawn on identifying the correct therapeutic approach by testing various treatments. Fiber, non-absorbable antibiotics and probiotics seem to be effective in treating symptomatic and uncomplicated patients, and 5-aminosalicylic acid might help prevent acute diverticulitis. Unfortunately, robust evidence on the effectiveness of a medical strategy to prevent acute diverticulitis recurrence is still lacking. We herein provide a concise review on the effectiveness and future perspectives of these treatments.

Prevention of acute diverticulitis

Primary prevention of acute diverticulitis is a very important topic. Acute diverticulitis, defined as acute inflammation of a colonic diverticulum, is a common emergency presentation managed by both surgeons and physicians. Factors predisposing to the development of acute diverticulitis include obesity, smoking, lack of physical activity and medication use such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.

There have been advances in the medical treatments offered to patients in recent years. Patients with uncomplicated diverticulitis are generally treated as outpatients with a clear liquid diet and antibiotics. In outpatients, broad-spectrum antibiotics are usually given for 7–10 days. If opioid analgesics are required for pain control, meperidine is the preferred option since morphine causes colonic spasm and may accentuate colonic hyper-segmentation.

Outpatient treatment is effective in most cases, and less than 10% of patients are readmitted at the emergency room for diverticulitis within 60 days of the initial evaluation. Hospitalization with intravenous antibiotic treatment is usually recommended by current guidelines if the patient: is unable to take oral therapy; is affected by severe comorbidity; fails to improve with outpatient therapy; or is affected by complicated diverticulitis. Clinical improvement in patients affected by acute diverticulitis is generally observed within 3–4 days. If patients are hospitalized, a 7–10 day course of oral antibiotics is usually given following discharge. However, results of studies investigating such prevention are often conflicting.

### Emerging evidence and recent controversies in diverticulitis: a 5-year review [^114Y6a1M]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Despite the longtime prevalence of diverticulitis as one of the most common gastrointestinal diseases in both the inpatient and outpatient setting, its etiology, prevention, and treatment remain hotly contested. Once viewed as a disorder of primarily older people in western populations, diverticulitis has rapidly increased its presence in all age groups worldwide, prompting researchers to reexamine the pathophysiology of the disease process. Clinicians continue to push the envelope with novel approaches to management, from avoiding antibiotics for uncomplicated cases to identifying subsets of patients with complicated diverticulitis who may not require an operation. Here, we review the most recent literature on a wide array of topics in diverticulitis, with an emphasis on publications within the last 5 years.

### Things we Do for No reason ™: routine use of antibiotics for acute uncomplicated diverticulitis [^113LTjv2]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

The treatment of acute uncomplicated diverticulitis (UD) with antibiotics remains common despite substantial evidence supporting the non-inferiority of nonantibiotic outpatient management. In the past 15 years, there have been two landmark randomized-controlled clinical trials, follow-up studies, and numerous retrospective studies that have supported the non-inferiority of nonantibiotic management of UD. Multiple medical societies including the American Gastroenterological Association and the American College of Physicians recommend using antibiotics selectively rather than routinely in UD. We aim to raise physician awareness of the latest guideline recommendations through our article, potentially improving antibiotic stewardship and reducing related healthcare costs.

### Diverticulitis, AAA, multiple sclerosis, iron deficiency… [^11698gGS]. AAFP (2023). Medium credibility.

What lifestyle recommendations should be provided to patients to prevent diverticulitis and recurrent diverticulitis. Consumption of popcorn, nuts, or seeds is not a risk factor for developing diverticulitis. A high-fiber diet is associated with a lower incidence of diverticular disease, but evidence about whether it prevents the recurrence of diverticulitis is lacking. Tobacco cessation, reduced meat intake, physical activity, and weight loss are recommended interventions to decrease the risk of recurrence. Do all patients with diverticulitis require treatment with antibiotics. No. Select patients with uncomplicated diverticulitis can be treated without antibiotics. A meta-analysis of nine randomized controlled trials with 2, 505 patients showed that those treated without antibiotics had shorter hospital stays than those treated with antibiotics, and there was no difference in complication or readmission rates. Who should be screened for abdominal aortic aneurysm. The U.

S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends one-time screening for AAA with ultrasonography in men 65 to 75 years of age who have ever smoked and selective screening with ultrasonography in men 65 to 75 years of age with risk factors for AAA who have never smoked, rather than routinely screening all men in this group. The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for AAA in women 65 to 75 years of age who have ever smoked or have a family history of AAA. Are intravenous steroids more effective than oral steroids in treating acute relapses of multiple sclerosis. There is no difference in effectiveness between oral and intravenous steroids in treating acute relapses of multiple sclerosis. A higher dosage of steroids, such as 1, 000 mg per day of methylprednisolone for three days, is recommended.

Is intravenous iron infusion superior to oral iron for avoiding blood transfusion in adults with iron deficiency anemia. Intravenous iron administration does not reduce the need for blood transfusion compared with oral iron supplementation, based on multiple meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials. Additional Online Only AFP Clinical Answers Are epidural steroid injections effective for low back pain. Treatment with epidural steroid injections in the lower spine is not effective for reducing pain and disability. The injections may be more effective than placebo at short-term follow-up, but the effects are not clinically meaningful.
