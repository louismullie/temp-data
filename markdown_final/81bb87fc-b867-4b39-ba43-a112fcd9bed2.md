## Question

What is the adenosine dose for atrial fibrillation in a patient with WPW?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what adenosine dose to use for atrial fibrillation in a patient with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether adenosine is appropriate or contraindicated in pre-excited atrial fibrillation. Then, I should verify the guideline-recommended acute management pathways for unstable and stable patients. Next, I will review why adenosine can be dangerous mechanistically in WPW with AF. After that, I should outline the correct pharmacologic options and when to use electrical cardioversion. Finally, for completeness, I will clarify adenosine dosing for its indicated use in PSVT only, double-check the labeling details, and caution about any diagnostic roles like an adenosine challenge, all with careful source verification.

> Let me first confirm the premise, because I need to ensure we are not propagating a dangerous recommendation. In atrial fibrillation with anterograde accessory pathway conduction, that is pre-excited AF in WPW, adenosine is contraindicated due to the risk of accelerating ventricular response and precipitating ventricular fibrillation or hemodynamic collapse, and guidelines explicitly recommend against AV nodal blockers such as adenosine, verapamil, diltiazem, beta-blockers, digoxin, and amiodarone in this setting [^115hR2Ew] [^116hNf2o] [^115YjCUR].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions without understanding the mechanism. Adenosine causes transient high-grade AV nodal block, which removes the AV node's gatekeeping and can paradoxically channel more atrial impulses down the accessory pathway during AF, increasing the ventricular rate and risking VF; in addition, adenosine does not convert atrial fibrillation, as its proven indication is AV nodal–dependent PSVT, not AF or flutter, which reinforces that it is both ineffective for AF and potentially dangerous in pre-excited AF [^115V8uTk] [^115hR2Ew]. I should also note the cautionary clinical signal: there are case reports of adenosine precipitating pre-excited AF and deterioration, and the analogous AV nodal–selective effect of digoxin in WPW with AF is well known to increase VF risk, underscoring the class-wide concern in this physiology [^112z7pXZ] [^1131mJeV].

> Next, I should review the correct emergency management so we give the right alternative. If the patient with WPW and AF is unstable with hypotension, ischemia, or shock, the recommended treatment is immediate synchronized electrical cardioversion, and I need to ensure pads are on and sedation is appropriate if time permits [^115KoJg4] [^116hNf2o]. If the patient is hemodynamically stable, the pharmacologic strategy is intravenous procainamide or intravenous ibutilide to restore sinus rhythm or slow pre-excited conduction; at the same time I must strictly avoid AV nodal–blocking agents, including adenosine, verapamil, diltiazem, beta-blockers, digoxin, and amiodarone in this specific scenario of pre-excited AF, because these can worsen pre-excitation and precipitate VF [^116hNf2o] [^115YjCUR]. Let me double-check that both North American and Canadian guidelines align here, and yes, they do, which strengthens the recommendation framework [^115hR2Ew] [^115KoJg4].

> I will now examine why providing an adenosine dose here would be misleading, but for completeness I will specify the appropriate dosing only for its indicated use in AV nodal–dependent PSVT, not for AF or WPW with AF. Typical adult dosing is 6 mg rapid IV bolus followed by a 12 mg rapid IV bolus if needed after 1 to 2 minutes, and the labeling summary used in some formularies lists a "maximum 12 mg per day", which I initially might have repeated without scrutiny [^115iX9hE]. Wait, let me verify the detailed FDA labeling because I need to ensure dosing accuracy; the FDA insert describes 6 mg followed by 12 mg, and if the 12 mg fails it may be repeated a second time, which implies that a total higher than 12 mg can be used in a monitored setting for PSVT conversion, so the prior "maximum 12 mg per day" phrasing is too restrictive compared with the full label instructions [^111Nrk6i]. I should also reaffirm that adenosine is not effective for converting atrial fibrillation, which is precisely why it has no therapeutic role for AF or pre-excited AF and should be avoided in WPW with AF due to harm risk [^115V8uTk].

> But wait, what if the question is about diagnostic use rather than therapy; I need to check that nuance. Adenosine challenge can be used in carefully selected stable settings to unmask subtle pre-excitation for risk stratification, but that is a diagnostic maneuver done with continuous monitoring and resuscitation capability, often in or in coordination with an electrophysiology environment, and it is not a treatment for AF or pre-excited AF [^114Qvz7x] [^1132hnVy]. Hold on, I should verify that this applies to pediatric cohorts as well; yes, pediatric series report effective use of diagnostic adenosine challenge with appropriate monitoring and EP follow-up, reinforcing that the setting and intent must be strictly diagnostic, not therapeutic for AF in WPW [^114Qvz7x].

> Let me summarize to ensure there is no ambiguity. There is no safe adenosine dose for treating atrial fibrillation in WPW with pre-excitation, because adenosine is contraindicated and can precipitate life-threatening deterioration via accelerated accessory pathway conduction and ventricular fibrillation; treat the unstable patient with immediate synchronized cardioversion, and treat the stable patient with intravenous procainamide or ibutilide while avoiding all AV nodal–blocking agents including adenosine, verapamil, diltiazem, beta-blockers, digoxin, and amiodarone in this scenario [^115hR2Ew] [^116hNf2o] [^115KoJg4].

---

Do not use **adenosine** for atrial fibrillation with WPW [^115hR2Ew] because it may precipitate dangerous ventricular acceleration or ventricular fibrillation [^112z7pXZ]. Instead, use **IV procainamide or ibutilide** [^116hNf2o] for stable patients and perform immediate synchronized cardioversion if the patient is unstable [^115KoJg4]. Avoid **AV nodal blockers** — including beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, digoxin [^1131mJeV], amiodarone, and adenosine [^115hR2Ew] — in pre-excited AF [^115YjCUR].

---

## Clinical risks of adenosine in WPW-associated AF

Adenosine **blocks the AV node** [^115hR2Ew], which can shift conduction to the accessory pathway [^112z7pXZ], producing rapid ventricular rates and potentially triggering ventricular fibrillation [^117GPB8J]. This risk is greatest when the accessory pathway has a short refractory period, allowing very rapid conduction.

---

## Current guideline recommendations

Current guidelines explicitly **advise against adenosine** [^115hR2Ew] in AF with pre-excitation due to the risk of ventricular fibrillation or hemodynamic collapse. Recommended alternatives include **IV procainamide or ibutilide** [^116hNf2o] for stable patients with pre-excited AF [^115KoJg4] and **immediate synchronized cardioversion** for unstable patients [^116DiEyD].

---

## Alternative pharmacological management

For stable pre-excited AF, **use agents that slow conduction over the accessory pathway** [^115KoJg4].

| **Medication** | **Recommended dose** | **Clinical considerations** |
|-|-|-|
| Procainamide | 15 mg/kg IV over 30–60 min | Monitor for hypotension and QRS widening |
| Ibutilide | - 1 mg IV over 10 min <br/> - Repeat once if needed | Monitor for QT prolongation and torsades de pointes |
| Flecainide | 2 mg/kg IV over 10 min (max 150 mg) | Avoid in structural heart disease |
| Propafenone | 2 mg/kg IV over 10 min (max 150 mg) | Avoid in structural heart disease |

---

## Clinical scenarios where adenosine may be considered

Adenosine may be used for diagnostic purposes in narrow-complex tachycardias [^112z7pXZ] when AF is not suspected, but only with continuous ECG monitoring and immediate access to resuscitation equipment. It is **not indicated for AF with pre-excitation** [^115V8uTk].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Do not use adenosine**: in AF with pre-excitation [^115hR2Ew] due to risk of ventricular fibrillation.
- **Use procainamide or ibutilide**: for stable pre-excited AF [^116hNf2o] [^115KoJg4].
- **Perform immediate cardioversion**: if the patient is unstable.

---

Adenosine is contraindicated in **AF with WPW** [^115hR2Ew] because it can precipitate ventricular fibrillation; use procainamide or ibutilide [^116hNf2o] for stable patients [^115KoJg4] and perform immediate synchronized cardioversion if the patient is unstable.

Although serious adverse events following adenosine administration are rare, it should only be administered in an environment where continuous ECG monitoring and emergency resuscitation equipment are available. The case report describes the development of pre-excited atrial fibrillation in a 31-year-old woman with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome following the administration of adenosine. She had previously been fit and well and was admitted to the coronary care unit with a 2-hour history of regular palpitations. A 12-lead ECG showed a narrow QRS complex tachycardia. Carotid sinus massage was unsuccessful in terminating the tachycardia, and the patient subsequently received rapid boluses of intravenous adenosine. The cardiac rhythm degenerated into atrial fibrillation with ventricular pre-excitation following 12 mg adenosine.

- **Methods**:

- **Patients**:
	- Consecutive patients with overt or intermittent WPW syndrome who were hospitalized at Henan Provincial People's Hospital and Fuwai Central China Cardiovascular Hospital for radiofrequency ablation between January 2013 to September 2018 were retrospectively reviewed. The inclusion criteria were (a) at least one documented episode of AF before ablation; (b) performance of AP ablation alone, with no catheter ablation for AF; (c) successful catheter ablation, defined as the elimination of Kent bundle conduction by demonstration of atrial and ventricular pacing even after isoproterenol infusion; and (d) available records of a post‐ablation, 12‐lead ECG. The exclusion criteria were (a) repeated ablations; (b) previous cardiac surgery, congenital heart disease, or serious valvular heart disease; and (c) thyroid dysfunction on admission (abnormal free thyroxine or thyroid‐stimulating hormone level). The study protocol conformed to the ethical guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki. All patients were informed about the investigational nature of the catheter ablation procedure and provided written informed consent to undergo the procedure. The study protocol was approved by the local institutional review board. The requirement for informed consent has been waived because of the retrospective nature of the study.

- **Electrophysiological study and catheter ablation**:
	- The patients underwent an electrophysiological study after all antiarrhythmic drugs had been discontinued for at least five half‐lives and before radiofrequency catheter ablation was performed.

### Efficacy of nifekalant in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome and atrial fibrillation: Electrophysiological and clinical findings [^113hsdWr]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

- **Electrophysiological and clinical effects**: Nifekalant was studied in patients with preexcitation (n = 51). The lines with a dot at each end represent the parameter changes in every preexcited patient. Horizontal bars and vertical lines denote mean values and standard deviations. Atrial fibrillation is indicated with a semicolon; average preexcited R-R interval, average R-R interval, heart rate, percentage preexcitation, and the ratio of preexcited complexes to total ventricular complexes during systolic blood pressure are all shown. The shortest preexcited R-R interval was also measured.

- **Characteristic response of nifekalant**: The response was observed in two patients with preexcited atrial fibrillation. The first patient, a 47-year-old man with preexcitation and paroxysmal events but no structural heart disease, had a pre-infusion interval of 283 ms. At 7 minutes post-nifekalant infusion, this interval prolonged to 329 ms with an intermittent narrow appearance. This patient subsequently underwent ablation of both the accessory pathway and preexcitation sites. The second patient, a 69-year-old woman with spontaneous sustained preexcited atrial fibrillation and rheumatic heart disease with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 35%, showed a pre-infusion interval of 310 ms. This prolonged to 420 ms with an intermittent narrow appearance at 7 minutes post-infusion. Arrows indicated the narrow complex without preexcitation. This patient underwent ablation of the accessory pathway only.

Chest pain is not an uncommon complaint among adolescents; however, it often leads them to seek emergency medical care. Variant angina, characterized by coronary artery spasm resulting in acute myocardial ischemia, is an extremely rare cause of chest pain in the pediatric population, with very few reported cases. We describe a 13-year-old boy with underlying intermittent Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome who experienced acute coronary artery syndrome due to coronary artery vasospasm.

Conventional catheter ablation of cardiac arrhythmias is associated with the potential adverse effects of low-dose ionizing radiation on both patients and laboratory personnel. Due to the greater radiation sensitivity and the longer life expectancy of children, reduction of radiation exposure for them is of particular importance. A novel technique for zero-fluoroscopy catheter ablation is described, using real-time tissue-tip contact force measurements for a 10-year-old boy who had Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome with a left-sided accessory pathway.

### Impact of adenosine on wavefront propagation in persistent atrial fibrillation: Insights from global noncontact charge density mapping of the left atrium [^112zvDwB]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Low credibility.

In order to correct for false positive pattern detection and isolated occurrences, and to identify regions where specified activation patterns are repeatedly observed, a method of applying detection cutoffs was devised for LRA and LIA. A dynamic threshold, individualized for each recording, is required due to significant variation in frequency and duration of patterns across the chamber. A fixed frequency threshold suitable for one patient/map segment could exclude all activation occurrences or not sufficiently exclude regions with low relative frequency when applied to another recording.

Additionally, the relationship between frequency and duration of pattern occurrences is not fixed. A threshold considering only a set percentage of pattern occurrences, without including the duration these are present, may be inadequate. First, a static map was generated with all pattern occurrences included, and the percentage of time the pattern was present anywhere in the chamber was calculated. Occurrences were then excluded using cutoff values according to the frequency of each pattern, representing a 5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, and 40% relative drop in the total time the pattern was present. This resulted in gradually greater exclusion of regions with infrequent pattern occurrences, leaving those with the greatest frequency of detection.

As well as measuring the number of occurrences of each activation pattern, measuring the proportion of time these patterns are present over the fixed map duration (5 seconds) provides a measure of the pattern dynamics.

### Determining the optimal dose of adenosine for unmasking dormant pulmonary vein conduction following atrial fibrillation ablation: Electrophysiological and hemodynamic assessment. DORMANT-AF study [^117SNqkg]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2017). Low credibility.

The significance of adenosine-induced dormant pulmonary vein (PV) conduction in atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation remains controversial. The optimal dose of adenosine to determine dormant PV conduction is yet to be systematically explored.

- **Methods and results**: Consecutive patients undergoing index AF ablation received three adenosine doses (12, 18, and 24 mg) in a randomized blinded order, immediately after pulmonary vein isolation (PVI). Electrophysiological (PR prolongation, AV block (AVB), and PV reconnection) and hemodynamic (BP) parameters were measured. A total of 339 doses (113 doses each) assessed 191 PVs in 50 patients (66% male, 72% PAF, 52% hypertensive). Dormant PV conduction occurred in 28% of patients (16.5% [32] of PVs). All cases were associated with AVB (AVB: PV reconnection vs. no PV reconnection 100% vs. 83%, P = 0.007). AVB occurred more frequently at 24 mg versus 12 mg (92% vs. 82%, P = 0.019) but not versus 18 mg (91%, P = 0.62). AVB duration progressed between 12 mg (12.0 ± 8.9 seconds), 18 mg (16.1 ± 9.1 seconds, P = 0.001), and 24 mg (19.0 ± 9.3 seconds, P 110 kg (65% vs. 91% in 70–110 kg group, P < 0.001) in response to adenosine was observed.

### Management of asymptomatic Wolff-Parkinson-White pattern by pediatric electrophysiologists [^114JrgTE]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2019). Low credibility.

To determine the present-day approach of pediatric cardiac electrophysiologists to asymptomatic Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) pattern and to contrast it to both published consensus statements and a similar survey, a study was conducted. A questionnaire was sent to 266 Pediatric and Congenital Electrophysiology Society physician members across 25 countries. It included 21 questions from a 2003 survey and added new questions on risk stratification and decision-making.

We received 113 responses from 13 countries. The responders had extensive electrophysiology experience, with a median of 15 years (IQR 8.5–25 years). Only 12 (11%) believed that intermittent pre-excitation, and 37 (33%) believed that sudden loss of pre-excitation on an exercise test, were sufficient evidence of accessory pathway safety to avoid an invasive electrophysiology study. The optimal weight for conducting an electrophysiology study was 20 kg (IQR 18–22.5 kg). Subsequently, 61% and 58% of responders would ablate all right-sided or left-sided accessory pathways, respectively, regardless of electrophysiological properties, whereas only 23% would ablate all septal accessory pathways (P < .001). Compared to 2003, respondents were more likely to consider inducible arrhythmia (77% vs 26%, P < .001) as sufficient indication alone for ablation.

In the context of recent literature regarding the reliability of risk-stratification tools, most operators are now performing electrophysiology study for asymptomatic Wolff-Parkinson-White regardless of noninvasive findings. Many will then proceed to default ablation of all accessory pathways.

### Extracorporeal life support for cardiac arrest in a 13-year-old girl caused by Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome [^113Y8ho9]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Generally, Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome presents a good prognosis. However, several case reports have demonstrated malignant arrhythmia or sudden cardiac death as WPW syndrome's first presentation. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation using extracorporeal life support is a therapeutic option in refractory cardiac arrest. We present a WPW syndrome patient who experienced sudden cardiac arrest as the first presentation of the disease, and we treated it using extracorporeal life support with a good neurologic outcome.

Regarding specific circumstances for atrial fibrillation, more specifically with respect to patients with valvular heart disease, the ACC/ACCP/AHA/HRS 2024 guidelines recommend initiating long-term anticoagulation with warfarin over DOACs. This recommendation aims to prevent cardiovascular events, including stroke or death, in patients with rheumatic mitral stenosis (MS) or MS of moderate or greater severity and a history of atrial fibrillation, independent of the CHA2DS2-VASc score.

### Advanced interatrial block predicts recurrence of atrial fibrillation after accessory pathway ablation in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome [^116Yo8MW]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Low credibility.

Because patients with advanced interatrial block (IAB) have a high risk of atrial fibrillation (AF) recurrence after accessory pathway (AP) ablation, additional interventions are required to prevent AF recurrence in this population. Pulmonary vein isolation is an established effective treatment for paroxysmal AF. However, we did not assess whether pulmonary vein isolation was effective for preventing AF recurrence in patients in the present study. Although the pulmonary vein is reportedly involved in the development of paroxysmal AF in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome, atrial substrate abnormalities partially determine the likelihood of AF recurrence after AP ablation in these patients. Thus, the clinical efficacy of pulmonary vein isolation for preventing AF recurrence in these patients requires further study.

Regarding specific circumstances for atrial fibrillation, more specifically with respect to patients with CKD, the ACC/ACCP/AHA/HRS 2024 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of warfarin or labeled doses of DOACs to reduce the risk of stroke in patients with AF at elevated risk for stroke and CKD stage 4.

### Efficacy of nifekalant in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome and atrial fibrillation: Electrophysiological and clinical findings [^115gQTAx]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). High credibility.

Nifekalant, initially named MS‐551 in Japan, is a pure class 3 antiarrhythmic drug that is highly selective for blocking the rapid component of the delayed-rectifier potassium currents without affecting the inward sodium and calcium currents or β‐adrenergic activity. Nifekalant prolongs the effective refractory period (ERP) of ventricular and atrial myocytes, exerts antiarrhythmic effects, and decreases the defibrillation threshold. Increasing clinical data indicate that nifekalant is an effective and safe drug in the treatment of refractory ventricular arrhythmias, especially in patients with ILVF. Nifekalant is also recommended by the European Resuscitation Council Guidelines and International Consensus on Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation for the treatment of ventricular arrhythmias. More recently, nifekalant has been used in the treatment of atrial arrhythmia and cardioversion of AF and atrial flutter. However, the potential utility of nifekalant in the treatment of preexcited AF has not been studied. The purpose of this study was to assess the electrophysiological and clinical effects of nifekalant in patients with preexcited AF.

### Effect of pulmonary vein isolation on atrial fibrillation recurrence after accessory pathway ablation in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome [^114tFe24]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Low credibility.

Several limitations of our study should be considered. First, the small sample size may have introduced statistical bias. Further studies with larger numbers of patients are needed to evaluate the effects of pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) on atrial fibrillation (AF) recurrence after accessory pathway (AP) ablation in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome. Second, it is not possible to identify advanced interatrial block (IAB) before AP ablation in patients with WPW syndrome because the delta wave overshadows the point at which the P-wave ends. Additionally, P-wave duration was measured based on the ECG obtained immediately after the ablation procedure; thus, residual atrial injury from the ablation procedure may have affected the P-wave duration. Finally, the generalizability of our findings may be limited by the single-center, retrospective, observational approach.

### Efficacy of nifekalant in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome and atrial fibrillation: Electrophysiological and clinical findings [^112Mng4W]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). High credibility.

All patients undergoing electrophysiological stimulation for the induction of atrial fibrillation (AF) were under the same anesthetic regimen as those who presented with spontaneous sustained preexcited AF. Both groups received local anesthesia at the puncture sites prior to puncture procedures. No other anesthetic was administered during the electrophysiological (EP) studies and drug infusion. Importantly, 12 of the 51 patients (24%) were identified with structural heart disease and exhibited a low mean left ventricular ejection fraction of 36 ± 6%.

- **EP study methodology**: EP studies were conducted using a WorkMate Claris System (St. Jude Medical Inc, Little Canada, MN). Surface ECG and bipolar intracardiac electrograms were recorded simultaneously from locations including the high right atrium, coronary sinus, His bundle region, right ventricular apex, and left atrium, where appropriate. AF induction was routinely achieved through rapid atrial decremental pacing with a cycle length between 200 to 50 ms and a pulse width of 2 ms. Notably, isoproterenol and other adrenergic drugs were not employed during EP studies or AF induction, to prevent potential confounding effects of adrenergic stimulation on the shortest preexcited R‐R (SPRR) interval and other electrical parameters.

AF was classified as sustained if it persisted for more than 10 minutes. Nifekalant infusion was initiated following 10 minutes of successful AF induction, commencing with an initial dose of 0.3 mg/kg over a period of 5 minutes, followed by continuous infusion at 10 μg/kg per minute for 25 minutes. The infusion was discontinued upon the termination of AF.

### Efficacy of nifekalant in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome and atrial fibrillation: Electrophysiological and clinical findings [^116CamTC]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

- **Trend of ventricular response**: Figure 4 illustrates the trend of ventricular response at different infusion times of nifekalant during preexcited states. In panel A, the trend for preexcited ventricular response in 42 patients whose condition was not terminated before 7 minutes is shown. Panel B depicts the trend for 18 patients whose condition was not terminated before 30 minutes. Both panels indicate no acceleration of ventricular response in patients with preexcited states during nifekalant infusion. The maximal therapeutic effects of nifekalant were observed at 7 to 10 minutes of infusion. Notations indicate atrial fibrillation; average preexcited R-R interval; average R-R interval; shortest preexcited R-R interval.

- **Patient outcomes**: One patient developed Torsades de Pointes (TdP) after nifekalant infusion. This patient, a 58-year-old female, had spontaneous sustained preexcited atrial fibrillation (AF). Twelve minutes post-infusion, AF converted to sinus bradycardia (heart rate at 40 beats per minute) before TdP developed. TdP was immediately terminated by pacing the right ventricle at 90 beats per minute and administering a bolus intravenous injection of 2.5 g magnesium sulfate. This patient had a low blood potassium level of 3.0 mmol/L. AF changed to atrial flutter (AFL) in 2 patients. No patients developed ventricular fibrillation (VF), cardiac arrest, or syncope during nifekalant infusion. There was no transient loss of the δ wave, defined as its complete disappearance on the ECG for at least 1 minute, in any patients during the infusion.

### Adenosine [^114gBxVq]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2017). Low credibility.

- **Drug interactions**: Intravenous adenosine has been effectively administered in the presence of other cardioactive drugs, such as quinidine, beta-adrenergic blocking agents, calcium channel blocking agents, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, without any change in the adverse reaction profile. Digoxin and verapamil use may be rarely associated with ventricular fibrillation when combined with adenosine (see WARNINGS). Because of the potential for additive or synergistic depressant effects on the SA and AV nodes, however, adenosine should be used with caution in the presence of these agents. The use of adenosine in patients receiving digitalis may be rarely associated with ventricular fibrillation (see WARNINGS).

	- The effects of adenosine are antagonized by methylxanthines such as caffeine and theophylline. In the presence of these methylxanthines, larger doses of adenosine may be required or adenosine may not be effective. Adenosine effects are potentiated by dipyridamole; thus, smaller doses of adenosine may be effective in the presence of dipyridamole. Carbamazepine has been reported to increase the degree of heart block produced by other agents. As the primary effect of adenosine is to decrease conduction through the A-V node, higher degrees of heart block may be produced in the presence of carbamazepine.

- **Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, and impairment of fertility**: Studies in animals have not been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of adenosine. Adenosine was negative for genotoxic potential in the Salmonella (Ames Test) and Mammalian Microsome Assay.

### Efficacy of nifekalant in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome and atrial fibrillation: Electrophysiological and clinical findings [^116ii4TK]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

The study involved eighty-seven patients (mean age 53 ± 11 years, 52 males) with persistent atrial fibrillation (AF) and no accessory pathway (AP). Participants did not present with abnormal electrolytes, prolonged QT interval (QTc ≥ 470 ms), AV conduction disorders, or left atrial thrombus. Among the 87 patients, 23 (26%) had structural heart disease with a low left ventricular ejection fraction (39 ± 5%).

Nifekalant was administered as specified earlier, and several parameters were evaluated: ventricular rate of AF before, 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 20, and 30 minutes post-infusion onset, AF cardioversion, blood pressure (BP), Torsades de Pointes (TdP), and other arrhythmias.

- **Statistical analysis**: Continuous variables with a normal distribution were presented as mean values ± SD, with the Student paired t-test determining significance between baseline and drug infusion. The variable PP, with a skew distribution, was presented as median (percentiles 25‐75), using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. A two-sided P value of < 0.05 was deemed statistically significant.

### Sinus bradycardia, Wolff-Parkinson-White, and left ventricular noncompaction: an embryologic connection [^115pPR4A]. Pediatric Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

Left ventricular noncompaction (LVNC) is an uncommon disorder that has recently been recognized as a distinct cardiomyopathy. LVNC is thought to result from an arrest in the normal process of myocardial compaction. The association of Wolff-Parkinson-White with noncompaction of the left ventricle is well recognized. Sinus bradycardia has also been associated with LVNC, although it occurs less frequently than Wolff-Parkinson-White.

We report an infant with LVNC, Wolff-Parkinson-White, and progressive sinus bradycardia who had a myocardial vascular abnormality in the region of the sinus node evident on autopsy. We propose that the progressive nature of the conduction system abnormality was a result of abnormal angiogenesis.

### Atrial flutter with 1:1 conduction in undiagnosed Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome [^1126rGuj]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Atrial flutter with 1:1 atrioventricular conduction via an accessory pathway is an uncommon presentation of Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome not previously reported in the emergency medicine literature. Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, a form of ventricular preexcitation sometimes initially seen and diagnosed in the emergency department (ED), can present with varied tachydysrhythmias for which certain treatments are contraindicated. For instance, atrial fibrillation with preexcited conduction needs specific consideration of medication choice to avoid potential degeneration into ventricular fibrillation.

- **Case report**: We describe an adult female presenting with a very rapid, regular wide complex tachycardia successfully cardioverted in the ED, followed by a normal electrocardiogram (ECG). Electrophysiology study confirmed atrial flutter with 1:1 conduction and revealed an accessory pathway consistent with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, despite lack of ECG findings of preexcitation during sinus rhythm.

Why should an emergency physician be aware of this? Ventricular tachycardia must be the first consideration in patients with regular wide complex tachycardia. However, clinicians should consider atrial flutter with 1:1 conduction related to an accessory pathway when treating patients with the triad of very rapid rate (> 250 beats/min), wide QRS complex, and regular rhythm, especially when considering pharmacologic treatment. Emergency physicians also should be aware of electrocardiographically concealed accessory pathways, and that lack of delta waves does not rule out preexcitation.

### Adenosine in the treatment of supraventricular tachycardia: 5 years of experience (2002–2006) [^1114qKAo]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

We report a retrospective analysis of 5 years of adenosine use in our emergency department (2002–2006). We treated 454 patients with an intravenous bolus of adenosine. The cohort comprised 40.7% men and 59.3% women, with a mean age of 47.32 years and a mean heart rate of 162.48 beats per minute. Among them, 73% responded immediately to the 6-mg dose, 15% responded after the second 12-mg dose, and 11% responded to a further 12-mg dose, whereas 11% were unresponsive. We observed minor side effects in a high percentage of patients, including chest tightness in 83%, flushing in 39.4%, and a sense of impending death in 7%. Only one major adverse effect was recorded: administering 12 mg of adenosine induced a marked acceleration in the ventricular rate of a patient with an undiagnosed atrial flutter, caused by induction of atrioventricular conduction (1:1).

Our results confirm that when patients are appropriately selected, adenosine is probably the best available drug to treat paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardias, especially in emergency situations.

### Effect of pulmonary vein isolation on atrial fibrillation recurrence after accessory pathway ablation in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome [^115b9nri]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Low credibility.

The methods involved a retrospective review of consecutive patients with overt or intermittent Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome who were hospitalized at Henan Provincial People's Hospital and Fuwai Central China Cardiovascular Hospital for radiofrequency ablation between January 2013 and September 2018.

The inclusion criteria were:

- **At least one documented episode of atrial fibrillation (AF) before ablation**: This was necessary to establish a history of AF prior to the intervention.
- **Undergoing accessory pathway (AP) ablation, with or without catheter ablation for AF during the same session**: This ensured that all patients received uniform treatment.
- **Successful AP ablation, defined as the elimination of AP conduction by demonstrated atrial and ventricular pacing even after isoproterenol infusion**: This criterion verified the effectiveness of AP ablation.
- **Available records of a post-ablation 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG)**: This was essential for post-procedure assessment.

The exclusion criteria included:

- **Repeated ablations**: To eliminate confounding from previous procedures.
- **Previous cardiac surgery, congenital heart disease, or serious valvular heart disease**: These conditions could affect outcomes independently.
- **Thyroid dysfunction on admission (abnormal free thyroxine or thyroid-stimulating hormone level)**: Thyroid issues could alter heart rhythms and confound results.

Patients were divided into two groups: the "AP group" included those who underwent AP ablation without pulmonary vein isolation (PVI), and the "AP + PVI group" included those who underwent both AP ablation and PVI during the same session.

The study protocol adhered to the ethical guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki. All patients were informed of the investigational nature of the catheter ablation procedure and provided written informed consent to undergo the procedure. The study protocol was approved by the local institutional review board, and the requirement for informed consent for this study has been waived due to its retrospective nature.

### Surgical treatment of Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome: Resuscitation of a forgotten technique [^113xDUCi]. JTCVS Techniques (2023). High credibility.

The surgical approach was executed through a median sternotomy under cardiopulmonary bypass, without cardioplegic arrest. This technique allowed for real-time electrophysiologic testing during the procedure. An incision was made through the right ventricular epicardial fat a few millimeters lateral to the atrioventricular junction and over the right coronary artery (RCA). The epicardial fat was dissected away from the RCA to attempt division of the accessory pathway. However, this resulted in no change in preexcitation.

The right atrium was then opened with a free wall incision, exposing the tricuspid valve. Sites of previous catheter ablation were clearly visible due to endocardial scarring (Figure 2, A). An incision was made approximately 5 mm from the tricuspid annulus, starting at the 1 o'clock position, and extended to the coronary sinus. The dissection proceeded through the endocardium, exposing the RCA from the inside and continuing into the pyramidal space (Figure 2, B). At the point of dissection into the pyramidal space (indicated by a blue arrow in Figure 2, B), preexcitation disappeared, consistent with the division of a subendocardial posterior-septal pathway.

Adenosine was administered for atrioventricular nodal blockade, during which neither antegrade nor retrograde conduction across the accessory pathway was demonstrable. Further ablation was performed using radiofrequency and cryoablative techniques along the endocardial dissection plane.

### Occurrence of intermittent Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome during intravenous sedation [^1136LByR]. Journal of Clinical Anesthesia (2008). Low credibility.

Patients with intermittent Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome, defined as intermittent loss of the delta waves, can show occasional conduction through the accessory pathway. WPW syndrome often causes paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia or atrial fibrillation. However, it may be difficult to identify the abnormalities preoperatively because of their only intermittent occurrence. We report a case in which exogenously administered epinephrine and an autonomic imbalance may have precipitated the abrupt occurrence and disappearance of the delta waves.

### Efficacy of nifekalant in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome and atrial fibrillation: Electrophysiological and clinical findings [^114xYpjb]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

This study explores the effect of nifekalant in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome and atrial fibrillation. The study reviews electrophysiological and clinical findings to determine the efficacy of nifekalant.

- **Methodology**: The researchers conducted an extensive review of clinical trials and electrophysiological studies, evaluating nifekalant's impact on arrhythmia management. The trials assessed both the acute and long-term efficacy of the drug.

- **Results**: The findings indicate that nifekalant significantly reduces the occurrence of atrial fibrillation episodes. Patients experienced a notable improvement in cardiac rhythm stability, suggesting potential benefits of nifekalant as a treatment option for those affected by Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome.

- **Conclusion**: The study provides important insights into the clinical utility of nifekalant. Despite the promising results, further research is necessary to confirm these findings and establish comprehensive treatment guidelines.

These insights contribute to the ongoing discussion regarding optimal management strategies for these patients.

### Management of asymptomatic Wolff-Parkinson-White pattern in young patients: Has anything changed [^115zVSLc]. Pediatric Cardiology (2019). Low credibility.

The approach to pediatric asymptomatic Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) patients is controversial. The objective of this review is to update the last consensus of specialists from the Pediatric and Congenital Electrophysiology Society/Heart Rhythm Society on this subject in order to summarize the most recent evidence on the management of young patients with asymptomatic WPW pattern. A systematic review of the literature published between 2008 and 2018 was conducted, following the protocol of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA), using databases such as PubMed (including Cochrane), Embase, and Web of Science. Observational, experimental, and multicentric studies were included. Out of a total of 37 articles selected, 4 were considered eligible. Most studies considered a cutoff age of 8 or greater, as recommended in the 2012 consensus. The identification of a shortest pre-excitatory RR interval (SPERRI) ≤ 250 ms seems to be the best predictor for risk stratification. There was consensus on the importance of routine isoprenaline use to improve the sensitivity of the electrophysiological study to identify patients at high risk of sudden death. Prophylactic ablative therapy has been indicated in asymptomatic children with an accessory pathway (AP) who have a low SPERRI and/or a low effective anterograde period of the AP and/or multiple APs. Despite the evidence found in the most recent studies, more studies are warranted in this setting.

### Cardiovascular disease in the Young Council's science and clinical education lifelong learning committee: Year in review [^113bovY4]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Challenging existing knowledge of Wolf-Parkinson-White and Brugada syndrome

This year, three articles advanced our understanding of Wolf-Parkinson-White and Brugada syndromes, challenging existing knowledge and provoking new thoughts about paradigms for treatment and management of these diseases.

Practice guidelines for the management of Wolf-Parkinson-White in children have largely been based on the assumption that the risk of sudden death is both predictable and ascertainable. A large retrospective multicenter international study of 912 children with Wolf-Parkinson-White provided evidence suggesting that, while the risk of sudden death in children remains low, the ability to identify those at highest risk remains difficult. These findings raise questions about future management recommendations and will likely affect the manner in which physicians counsel patients in the future.

Brugada syndrome has classically been considered a primary ion channel disorder. Although small case studies had previously suggested ablation as a curative therapy, multiple studies this year provide further evidence that epicardial ablation may successfully treat ventricular arrhythmias associated with Brugada syndrome in symptomatic adults. While long-term follow-up following ablation is lacking and studies in children have not been conducted, these preliminary results provide new insights into this disease. Regardless of whether ablation is found to be a treatment option for children with symptomatic Brugada syndrome, the manner in which we approach this disease and counsel patients is evolving.

### Efficacy of nifekalant in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome and atrial fibrillation: Electrophysiological and clinical findings [^115CJKrx]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

The electrophysiological evaluation of nifekalant in patients with PSVT involved 201 participants (mean age 38 ± 13 years, 128 males) undergoing electrophysiological (EP) studies. All participants presented with sinus rhythm. Among them, 87 patients (43%) exhibited preexcitation on the ECG, while 114 (57%) showed no evidence of preexcitation on ECG, indicating either concealed accessory pathways (AP) or dual AV node pathways. Only one patient had Ebstein anomaly; the rest had no structural heart disease. None of the patients had electrolyte abnormalities or a long QT interval (corrected QT interval [QTc] ≥ 470 ms).

Nifekalant infusion was administered as previously described. EP studies were conducted at baseline prior to the drug infusion and periodically during the infusion time (7–30 minutes). Seven-beat stimuli with a basic drive cycle length (S1) of 450 or 600 ms, delivered in -10 ms decrements, were applied. Various indices were measured including antegrade AP effective refractory period (ERP) and block cycle length (BCL), antegrade AV node ERP, ERP of the right atrium, ERP of the right ventricle (RV); AH, HV, PR, QRS, and QT intervals, as well as heart rate (HR) and blood pressure.

- **Antegrade AP and AVN ERP**: Defined as the longest A1-A2 interval that failed to conduct over the AP or AVN.
- **Antegrade BCL over the AP**: Defined as the shortest S1 cycle length that maintained 1:1 conduction at a decremental paced interval of 10 ms.
- **ERPs of Right atrium and RV**: Defined as the longest S1-S2 interval at which A2 (or V2) failed to produce a response.

The antegrade AP ERP and BCL were assessed in patients with preexcitation. The antegrade AVN ERP was primarily recorded in patients without antegrade conduction over any accessory pathway.

### Advanced interatrial block predicts recurrence of atrial fibrillation after accessory pathway ablation in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome [^111fi1R9]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Low credibility.

Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF) frequently occurs in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome. Although successful ablation of the accessory pathway (AP) eliminates paroxysmal AF in some patients, it can recur in others.

This retrospective study investigated the clinical utility of advanced interatrial block (IAB) for predicting the risk of AF recurrence in patients with verified paroxysmal AF and WPW syndrome after successful AP ablation. The study included 103 patients (70 men, 33 women; mean age, 44 ± 16 years) with WPW syndrome who had paroxysmal AF. A resting 12-lead electrocardiogram was performed immediately after successful AP ablation to evaluate the presence of advanced IAB. Advanced IAB was defined as a P-wave duration of > 120 ms and biphasic (±) morphology in the inferior leads.

During the mean follow-up period of 30.9 ± 20.0 months (range, 2–71 months), AF recurrence occurred in 16 patients (15.5%). Patients with advanced IAB had significantly reduced event-free survival from AF. Notably, advanced IAB (hazard ratio, 5.19; 95% confidence interval, 2.17–12.39; P < .001) and age ≥ 50 years (hazard ratio, 12.64; 95% CI, 1.33–119.75; p = 0.027) were identified as independent predictors of AF recurrence.

In conclusion, advanced IAB was an independent predictor of AF recurrence after successful AP ablation in patients with WPW syndrome.

### Lanoxin [^1131mJeV]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Ventricular fibrillation in patients with accessory AV pathway (Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome)**: Patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome who develop atrial fibrillation are at high risk of ventricular fibrillation. Treatment of these patients with digoxin leads to greater slowing of conduction in the atrioventricular node than in accessory pathways, thereby increasing the risks of rapid ventricular response leading to ventricular fibrillation.

- **Sinus bradycardia and sino-atrial block**: Lanoxin may cause severe sinus bradycardia or sinoatrial block, particularly in patients with pre-existing sinus node disease, and may cause advanced or complete heart block in patients with pre-existing incomplete AV block. Consider the insertion of a pacemaker before treatment with digoxin.

- **Post marketing experience**: The following adverse events have been reported from marketing experience with adenosine injection. These events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size and are often associated with concomitant diseases, multiple drug therapies, and surgical procedures. As such, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Decisions to include these events in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors:

1. Seriousness of the event
2. Frequency of the reporting
3. Strength of causal connection to the drug, or a combination of these factors

- **Cardiovascular**: Prolonged asystole, ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, transient increase in blood pressure, bradycardia, atrial fibrillation, and Torsade de Pointes.

- **Respiratory**: Bronchospasm.

- **Central nervous system**: Seizure activity, including tonic clonic (grand mal) seizures, and loss of consciousness.

### A randomized study of prophylactic catheter ablation in asymptomatic patients with the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome [^113Wdapq]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Young age and inducibility of atrioventricular reciprocating tachycardia or atrial fibrillation during invasive electrophysiological testing identify asymptomatic patients with a Wolff-Parkinson-White pattern on the electrocardiogram as being at high risk for arrhythmic events. We tested the hypothesis that prophylactic catheter ablation of accessory pathways would provide meaningful and durable benefits compared with no treatment in such patients.

- **Methods**: From 1997 to 2002, among 224 eligible asymptomatic patients with the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, patients at high risk for arrhythmias were randomly assigned to radio-frequency catheter ablation of accessory pathways (37 patients) or no treatment (35 patients). The end point was the occurrence of arrhythmic events over a five-year follow-up period.

- **Results**: Patients assigned to ablation had baseline characteristics similar to those of the controls. Two patients in the ablation group (5 percent) and 21 in the control group (60 percent) had arrhythmic events. One control patient had ventricular fibrillation as the presenting arrhythmia. The five-year Kaplan-Meier estimates of the incidence of arrhythmic events were 7 percent among patients who underwent ablation and 77 percent among the controls (P < 0.001 by the log-rank test); the risk reduction with ablation was 92 percent (relative risk, 0.08; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.02 to 0.33; P < 0.001).

- **Conclusions**: Prophylactic accessory-pathway ablation markedly reduces the frequency of arrhythmic events in asymptomatic patients with the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome.

### Efficacy of nifekalant in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome and atrial fibrillation: Electrophysiological and clinical findings [^115kLETs]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

**Effects of nifekalant on antegrade conduction (n = 78)**: The changes of antegrade conduction were observed in every patient during the baseline and nifekalant infusion state. Nifekalant was associated with the prolongation of antegrade conduction from 272 ± 52 ms to 309 ± 59 ms and from 323 ± 51 ms to 381 ± 63 ms, respectively (all P < 0.001). Nifekalant significantly decreased the proportion of patients with conduction times of less than 260 ms and those between 260 ms to less than 300 ms, from 40% to 23% and from 32% to 22%, respectively. Conversely, it increased the proportion of patients with conduction times of 300 ms to less than 350 ms and 350 ms or more, from 19% to 28% and from 9% to 27%, respectively. This indicates changes in the accessory pathway, block cycle length, and effective refractory period under the influence of nifekalant.

### Efficacy of nifekalant in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome and atrial fibrillation: Electrophysiological and clinical findings [^1166bw2S]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

The efficacy of nifekalant in preexcited atrial fibrillation has not been assessed.

- **Methods and results**: The study populations consisted of patients with sustained preexcited (n = 51), paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (n = 201), and persistent (n = 87) conditions. Effects of intravenous infusion of nifekalant were assessed on electrophysiological and clinical parameters. Nifekalant prolonged the shortest preexcited R-R, the average preexcited R-R, and the average R-R intervals from 290 ± 35 to 333 ± 44 ms, 353 ± 49 to 443 ± 64 ms, and 356 ± 53 to 467 ± 75 ms, respectively, in patients with preexcitation (all P < 0.001). Nifekalant also decreased the percentage of preexcited complexes, heart rate, and increased systolic pressure (all P < 0.001). Nifekalant terminated preexcitation in 33 of 51 patients (65%). Similar effects were observed in a subgroup of 12 patients with preexcitation and impaired left ventricular function.

In patients with paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia, nifekalant significantly prolonged the effective refractory period, the block cycle length of the antegrade accessory pathway, and the atrial effective refractory period (all P < 0.001). Nifekalant had no effect on the effective refractory period of the antegrade atrioventricular node. Finally, in patients with persistent atrial fibrillation without an accessory pathway, nifekalant did not significantly decrease the ventricular rate. One patient developed Torsades de Pointes; no other adverse effects were observed.

- **Conclusions**: Nifekalant prolongs the effective refractory period of the antegrade accessory pathway and atrium without blocking antegrade conduction.

### 2023 ACC/AHA/ACCP/HRS guideline for the diagnosis and management of atrial fibrillation: A report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Joint Committee on Clinical Practice Guidelines [^116k1KWz]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for atrial fibrillation, specifically with respect to rhythm control maintenance therapy, the ACC/ACCP/AHA/HRS 2024 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of dofetilide for long-term maintenance of sinus rhythm. Proper dose selection should be based on kidney function, with close monitoring of the QT interval, serum potassium and magnesium concentrations, and kidney function in patients with atrial fibrillation. This recommendation applies to patients without significant baseline QT interval prolongation or uncorrected hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia.

### Atrial fibrillation with broad QRS tachycardia and undiagnosed Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome: Diagnostic and therapeutic dilemmas in a pediatric patient [^111w8og3]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2012). Low credibility.

A 10-year-old girl presented to the emergency department of a regional hospital with one episode of generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Postictal monitoring followed by a 12-lead electrocardiogram showed fast atrial fibrillation with intermittent wide QRS regular tachycardia. Immediately following this, her rhythm changed to wide QRS irregular tachycardia without hemodynamic compromise. She was suspected to have ventricular tachycardia and was treated with intravenous amiodarone, resulting in cardioversion to sinus rhythm. A subsequent electrocardiogram in sinus rhythm showed typical features of manifest Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) accessory pathway. This case illustrates the diagnostic and therapeutic dilemmas in patients with atrial fibrillation, wide QRS tachycardia, and undiagnosed WPW syndrome with antidromic conduction of atrial arrhythmias through the accessory pathway. Furthermore, this case demonstrates that undiagnosed wide QRS tachycardias need to be treated with drugs acting on the accessory pathway, thus keeping in mind underlying WPW syndrome as a possibility to avoid potentially catastrophic events.

### Utility and safety of adenosine challenge for subtle ventricular pre-excitation in the pediatric population [^114Qvz7x]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2019). Low credibility.

Adenosine challenge (AC) can be used to evaluate possible Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) pattern on an electrocardiogram (ECG). Despite the use of this technique, there is a paucity of studies in the pediatric population evaluating the efficacy, safety, and outcomes of this testing modality.

- **Methods and results**: All ACs performed from January 2009 to June 2017 were retrospectively reviewed. Patient demographics, adenosine dosing, results, adverse effects, and outcomes, including results of electrophysiology studies (EPS), were reviewed. Analysis was conducted between AC positive and negative cohorts. ECG criteria of shortest PR interval, longest QRS duration, and the number of suspected pre-excited leads were evaluated for inter-rater reliability and correlation to positive AC. Fifty-six AC (n = 51) were performed (median age, 13.8; range, 0.3–20 years). Forty-one AC were pre-EPS and 15 post-EPS due to concern for reWPW. Thirty-one (76%) pre-EPS AC were negative, 9 (22%) positive, and 1 (2%) equivocal. EPS was performed following seven positive AC revealing 5 (71%) left posterior and 2 (29%) right posteroseptal AP. The 15 post-EPS AC were all found to be negative. Mean effective adenosine dose was 0.2 ± 0.11 mg/kg. No adverse events were reported. Mean follow-up duration after AC was 314 ± 482 days with no documented arrhythmias.

- **Conclusion**: Adenosine challenge is an effective and safe testing modality for subtle WPW in the pediatric population. In our population, there were no adverse events or documented arrhythmias in patients following a negative study.

### Malignant vasovagal syndrome in two patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome [^117Uv3Wk]. Heart (2004). Low credibility.

The presence of Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome in patients presenting with syncope suggests that tachyarrhythmia may be the cause. However, the symptoms require careful evaluation. Two young patients presented with syncope and were found to have WPW syndrome on their ECG. In both patients, symptoms were suggestive of vasovagal syncope. During tilt testing, both patients developed their typical symptoms, with a fall in blood pressure and heart rate confirming the diagnosis of malignant vasovagal syndrome.

### Long term risk of Wolff-Parkinson-White pattern and syndrome [^112Tj9wj]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

For years, conventional wisdom has held that patients with asymptomatic ventricular pre-excitation (asymptomatic WPW or WPW pattern) were at low risk for adverse outcomes. This assumption has been challenged more recently in a number of observational/natural history studies as well as in prospective trials in which patients were more aggressively studied via invasive electrophysiology study (EPS) and more aggressively treated, in some cases, with pre-emptive catheter ablation, despite the lack of symptoms. In sum, the data do not definitively support one approach (early, up-stream EPS and/or ablation) versus the other (watchful waiting with close monitoring). The most recent pediatric and adult guidelines reflect this ambiguity with a broad spectrum of approaches endorsed.

### Atrial fibrillation in the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome: ECG recognition and treatment in the ED [^116DiEyD]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Estimated to occur in 0.1% to 0.3% of the population, Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (WPW) is a condition where atrial impulses bypass the atrioventricular node and activate the ventricular myocardium directly via an accessory pathway. Clinical clues to the diagnosis include a young patient with previous episodes of palpitations, rapid heart rate, or syncope. Although several different rhythm presentations are possible, atrial fibrillation is a not infrequent dysrhythmia seen in the WPW patient. Electrocardiographic features suggestive of WPW atrial fibrillation include irregularity of the rhythm; a very rapid ventricular response; presence of a delta wave; and a wide, bizarre QRS complex. Stable patients suspected of having this condition should not receive agents that predominantly block atrioventricular conduction, but they may be treated with procainamide or ibutilide. If instability is present, electrical cardioversion is required.

### Electrophysiologic profile and results of invasive risk stratification in asymptomatic children and adolescents with the Wolff-Parkinson-White electrocardiographic pattern [^112rkvvL]. Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology (2014). Low credibility.

Data on the results and clinical effect of an invasive risk stratification strategy in asymptomatic young patients with the Wolff-Parkinson-White electrocardiographic pattern are scarce.

- **Methods and results**: Eighty-five consecutive patients aged < 18 years with a Wolff-Parkinson-White pattern and persistent preexcitation at maximum exercise undergoing invasive risk stratification were retrospectively studied. Adverse accessory pathway (AP) properties were defined according to currently consented criteria as any of the following: shortest preexcited RR interval during atrial fibrillation/rapid atrial pacing ≤ 250 ms (or antegrade effective refractory period ≤ 250 ms if shortest preexcited RR interval was not available) or inducible atrioventricular re-entrant tachycardia. Age at evaluation was median 14.9 years. Eighty-two patients had a structurally normal heart and 3 had hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. A single manifest AP was present in 80, 1 manifest and 1 concealed AP in 4, and 2 manifest APs in 1 patient. Adverse AP properties were present in 32 of 85 patients (37.6%) at baseline and in an additional 16 of 44 (36.4%) after isoproterenol. Ablation was performed in 41 of these 48 patients. Ablation was deferred in the remaining 7 for pathway proximity to the atrioventricular node. In addition, 18 of the low-risk patients were ablated based on patient/parental decision.

- **Conclusions**: Adverse AP properties at baseline were exhibited by 37.6% of the evaluated patients with asymptomatic Wolff-Parkinson-White preexcitation persisting at peak exercise.

### Efficacy of nifekalant in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome and atrial fibrillation: electrophysiological and clinical findings [^114YrSMx]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

The effects of procainamide, propafenone, flecainide, and ibutilide, recommended by the guideline or consensus, on preexcited atrial fibrillation (AF) have been reported by several investigators. Sellers et al. evaluated procainamide in 21 patients with preexcited AF. Boahene et al. evaluated procainamide in 30 patients and propafenone in 25 patients. Ludmer et al. evaluated propafenone in 10 patients. O'Nunain et al. evaluated propafenone and flecainide in 16 patients. Glatter et al. evaluated ibutilide in 14 patients. All showed the effectiveness of the four agents in preexcited AF, albeit with different magnitudes of efficacy.

For example, Boahene et al. showed that propafenone prolonged the shortest preexcited R-R interval (SPRR) from 215 ± 40 ms to 415 ± 198 ms, with a ΔSPRR of 200 ms. Ludmer et al. showed propafenone ΔSPRR to be 75 ms, whereas O'Nunain et al. showed propafenone ΔSPRR to be 37 ms. This indicates considerable heterogeneity among the studies. Factors contributing to this heterogeneity might include drug dose, infusion speed and time, intrinsic effective refractory period (ERP) of antegrade accessory pathway (AP), hemodynamic status, sympathetic and parasympathetic tone, and others.

The heterogeneity was more evident in the small-sample-size studies. Therefore, it is difficult to compare the effectiveness of nifekalant and other agents in the treatment of preexcited AF. Randomized controlled studies with large samples would be valuable to determine the comparative effectiveness of these agents. One notable difference is that propafenone, flecainide, and ibutilide could completely block the AP, whereas nifekalant did not completely block AP in the present study.

### 2017 HRS/EHRA/ECAS/APHRS/SOLAECE expert consensus statement on catheter and surgical ablation of atrial fibrillation [^1133ACDD]. Heart Rhythm (2017). High credibility.

The first study was a prospective, randomized clinical trial involving 534 patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF). All patients were administered adenosine 20 minutes following initial pulmonary vein isolation (PVI). The initial dose was 12 mg, which was titrated until at least one blocked P wave or a 3-second pause was observed. The presence of dormant pulmonary vein conduction was associated with an increased risk of arrhythmia recurrence. Patients with dormant pulmonary vein conduction were randomly assigned to additional adenosine-guided ablation or no further ablation. Elimination of dormant pulmonary vein conduction by additional targeted ablation significantly reduced recurrent atrial tachyarrhythmias (ATAs) by 56% during follow-up (P < .0001).

The most recent study enrolled 2113 patients with paroxysmal, persistent, and long-standing persistent atrial fibrillation. In this study, 0.4 mg per kg of adenosine was administered following a variable waiting time (median time 43 minutes). Early reconduction after the waiting time alone was observed in 42% of the patients in both groups. Subsequent administration of adenosine demonstrated further reconduction in an additional 27% of the patients. Further ablation was then performed to eliminate dormant conduction. At the end of 1 year of follow-up, no difference in outcome was observed, with a success rate of approximately 65% in each group. Notably, given the lower observed 27.6% prevalence of dormant conduction in the latter trial, a risk reduction of 72.4% in those patients with dormant conduction would have been required to detect a significant overall difference. It is also notable that the use of a force-sensing ablation catheter was implemented.

### 2023 ACC/AHA/ACCP/HRS guideline for the diagnosis and management of atrial fibrillation: A report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^112dUWEh]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for atrial fibrillation, specifically with respect to rhythm control maintenance therapy, the ACC/ACCP/AHA/HRS 2024 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of sotalol for long-term maintenance of sinus rhythm. Proper dose selection should be based on kidney function, with close monitoring of the QT interval, heart rate, serum potassium and magnesium concentrations, and kidney function. This approach is recommended for patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) without significant baseline QT interval prolongation, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, or bradycardia.

### Impact of adenosine on wavefront propagation in persistent atrial fibrillation: Insights from global noncontact charge density mapping of the left atrium [^1166AXMJ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Low credibility.

In light of the observation of localized repetitive activation (LRA) occurring over a greater left atrium surface area with adenosine, each map was visually inspected at the highest cutoff to identify whether regions with repetitive LRA remained spatially consistent or changed with adenosine use. At baseline, a region of repetitive LRA could be identified in 89% (31 of the 35) of maps, with 61 zones identified in total (1.7 ± 1.1 per map). Following adenosine infusion, 70 zones were identified across all 35 maps (2 ± 1 per map), with 42 of these zones (60%; 1.2 ± 1.0 per map) localized to the same site as LRA in baseline maps. Regions of high-frequency localized irregular activation (LIA) and LRA may overlap, given that multiple wavefronts over different atrial fibrillation (AF) cycles may or may not satisfy criteria for LRA within the same confined region (e.g. partial rotation through 180 degrees) and be classified as LIA.

A total of 81% of sites with high-frequency LRA with adenosine coincided with sites where high-frequency LIA was seen on baseline maps. There were 11 maps (in 9 patients) where the zones of LRA observed in adenosine maps were all in different sites from the baseline maps. In 4 of these, there were no regions of repetitive LRA seen at baseline.

Regions of highly repetitive LRA after adenosine infusion were identified at a 20% cutoff threshold, occurring at regions of LRA at baseline at lower frequency in one patient, in contrast with another patient in whom adenosine promoted LRA.

### Adenosine [^111Nrk6i]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2017). Low credibility.

- **Dosage and administration**: Adenosine injection is intended for rapid bolus intravenous use only. For effective delivery to the systemic circulation, it should be administered directly into a vein or as close to the patient as possible if given through an IV line, followed by a rapid saline flush.

- **Adult patients**: The dosing recommendations are based on clinical studies utilizing peripheral venous bolus dosing. Central venous administration of adenosine has not been systematically evaluated. The recommended intravenous doses for adults are:

	- **Initial dose**: Administer 6 mg as a rapid intravenous bolus over a 1 to 2-second period.
	- **Repeat administration**: If the initial dose does not eliminate supraventricular tachycardia within 1 to 2 minutes, administer 12 mg as a rapid intravenous bolus. This 12 mg dose may be repeated a second time if necessary.

- **Pediatric patients**: Dosages for neonates, infants, children, and adolescents are based on weight and are equivalent to those for adults.

	- Pediatric patients with a body weight < 50 kg

		- **Initial dose**: Administer 0.05 to 0.1 mg/kg as a rapid IV bolus, either centrally or peripherally, followed by a saline flush.
		- **Repeat administration**: If conversion of PSVT does not occur within 1 to 2 minutes, additional bolus injections of adenosine can be administered at incrementally higher doses, increasing the amount by 0.05 to 0.1 mg/kg. Follow each bolus with a saline flush.

### Effect of pulmonary vein isolation on atrial fibrillation recurrence after accessory pathway ablation in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome [^115YJHzp]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). High credibility.

Although successful ablation of the accessory pathway (AP) eliminates atrial fibrillation (AF) in some patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome and paroxysmal AF, in other patients it can recur. Whether adding pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) after successful AP ablation effectively prevents AF recurrence in patients with WPW syndrome is unknown.

We retrospectively studied 160 patients (102 men, 58 women; mean age, 46 ± 14 years) with WPW syndrome and paroxysmal AF who underwent AP ablation. Specifically, 103 (64.4%) underwent only AP ablation (AP group), while 57 (35.6%) underwent AP ablation plus PVI (AP + PVI group). Advanced interatrial block (IAB) was defined as a P-wave duration of > 120 ms and biphasic (±) morphology in the inferior leads, using 12-lead electrocardiography (ECG).

During a mean follow-up period of 30.9 ± 9.2 months (range, 3–36 months), 22 patients (13.8%) developed AF recurrence. The recurrence rate did not differ significantly between the AP + PVI group and the AP group (15.5% vs 10.5%, respectively; p = 0.373). Univariable and multivariable Cox regression analyses showed that PVI was not associated with the risk of AF recurrence (hazard ratio, 0.66; 95% confidence interval, 0.26–1.68; p = 0.380). In WPW patients with advanced IAB, the recurrence rate was lower in the AP + PVI group compared to the AP group (90% vs 33.3%, respectively; p = 0.032).

PVI after successful AP ablation significantly reduced the AF recurrence rate in WPW patients with advanced IAB. Screening of a resting 12-lead ECG can be beneficial in identifying patients who may benefit most from this combined approach.

### Efficacy of nifekalant in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome and atrial fibrillation: Electrophysiological and clinical findings [^111qxFCc]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

Patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome and atrial fibrillation (AF), also known as preexcited AF, typically present with a rapid ventricular response rate and wide QRS complexes. The fast conduction of atrial high-frequency impulses occurs preferentially via the accessory pathway (AP), which has a shorter refractory period than the atrioventricular node (AVN). Consequently, patients are at a higher risk of hemodynamic instability, spontaneous ventricular fibrillation (VF), and cardiac arrest.

Patients with preexcited AF who present with hemodynamic instability typically undergo prompt electrical cardioversion. Those with stable hemodynamics are commonly treated with infusion of an antiarrhythmic drug to decrease the preexcited ventricular rate and prevent hemodynamic instability. The 2017 European Heart Rhythm Association Consensus recommends procainamide, propafenone, flecainide, or ibutilide, whereas the 2014 American Heart Association Guidelines recommend procainamide or ibutilide for intravenous use to acutely slow the ventricular rate of preexcited AF.

The above four agents, however, are not recommended for the treatment of patients with preexcited AF and impaired left ventricular function (ILVF). Intravenous amiodarone, a multichannel blocker, was widely used in the treatment of patients with preexcited AF and ILVF. However, recent reports of accelerated preexcited ventricular responses and VF during amiodarone infusion have raised concerns about its utility. Therefore, intravenous amiodarone is no longer considered suitable for this context.

### 2020 APHRS/HRS expert consensus statement on the investigation of decedents with sudden unexplained death and patients with sudden cardiac arrest, and of their families [^1132hnVy]. Heart Rhythm (2021). Low credibility.

Adenosine challenge has been used to unmask pre-excitation that may otherwise be missed. In the absence of other causes, it will indicate the need for electrophysiological study to evaluate the risk of the accessory pathway (rapidity of antegrade conduction) followed by ablation therapy. However, electrophysiological study is not routinely included in the workup of unexplained cardiac arrest. Indeed, previous consensus guidelines proposed a Class 3 indication when assessing a suspected primary electrical disorder. It does not add additional diagnostic or prognostic value unless there is evidence to indicate otherwise.

Pre-excited atrial fibrillation, bundle branch re-entrant ventricular tachycardia, and rapid supraventricular tachycardias that degenerate into ventricular fibrillation have all previously been described as culprits requiring an invasive approach to diagnosis and curative ablation therapy. Electroanatomic voltage mapping of the right ventricle is a discretionary tool that may be considered to detect evidence of subclinical arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy. More recently, extensive endocardial and epicardial mapping of unexplained cardiac arrest cases has been employed to identify cases with either Purkinje triggers and/or subtle depolarization abnormalities that may be suitable for ablation therapy.

- **Recommendations for investigation of SCA survivors: Provocative testing**: Concealed Brugada syndrome, long QT syndrome, CPVT, arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy, pre-excitation, and coronary vasospasm may be uncovered by provocative maneuvers.

### Differentiating fasciculoventricular pathway from Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome by electrocardiography [^116iHzEN]. Heart Rhythm (2014). Low credibility.

In school-based cardiovascular screening programs in Japan, Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome is diagnosed based on the presence of an electrocardiographic (ECG) delta wave without differentiation from the fasciculoventricular pathway (FVP), although the risk of sudden death is associated only with the former.

- **Objective**: The purpose of this study was to differentiate FVP patients among children diagnosed with WPW syndrome by ECG.

- **Methods**: Children who were diagnosed with WPW syndrome through school screening between April 2006 and March 2008 and had QRS width ≤ 120 ms were included. Patients with asthma and/or coronary heart disease were excluded. FVP and WPW syndrome were differentiated based on ECG responses to adenosine triphosphate (ATP) injection. Age, PR interval, QRS width, and Rosenbaum classification were compared among patients.

- **Results**: Thirty patients (median age 12.7 years, range 6.5–15.7 years) participated in the study. FVP was diagnosed in 23 patients (76.7%), and WPW syndrome in 7 (23.3%). In Rosenbaum type A patients, all six patients had WPW syndrome, whereas FVP was diagnosed in 23 of 24 and WPW syndrome was diagnosed in 1 of 24 of type B patients. Age, PR interval, and QRS width were not significantly different between the two conditions.

- **Conclusion**: The ATP stress test was reliable in differentiating FVP from WPW syndrome. Although FVP is considered rare, the results of our study indicate that many WPW syndrome patients with QRS width ≤ 120 ms may actually have FVP. Patients categorized as type B are more likely to have FVP, whereas type A…

### Advanced interatrial block predicts recurrence of atrial fibrillation after accessory pathway ablation in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome [^116gNfcF]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Low credibility.

Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF) frequently occurs in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome. Although successful ablation of the accessory pathway (AP) eliminates paroxysmal AF in some patients, it can recur in others.

We investigated the clinical utility of advanced interatrial block (IAB) for predicting the risk of AF recurrence in patients with verified paroxysmal AF and WPW syndrome after successful AP ablation. This retrospective study included 103 patients (70 men, 33 women; mean age, 44 ± 16 years) with WPW syndrome who had paroxysmal AF. A resting 12-lead electrocardiogram was performed immediately after successful AP ablation to evaluate the presence of advanced IAB, which was defined as a P-wave duration of > 120ms and biphasic morphology in the inferior leads.

During the mean follow-up period of 30.9 ± 20.0 months (range, 2–71 months), 16 patients (15.5%) developed AF recurrence. Patients with advanced IAB had significantly reduced event-free survival from AF (P < .001). Multivariate Cox regression analysis identified advanced IAB (hazard ratio, 9.81; 95% CI, 2.68–35.90; P < .001) and age > 50 years (hazard ratio, 12.64; 95% CI, 1.33–119.75; p = 0.027) as independent predictors of AF recurrence.

Advanced IAB was an independent predictor of AF recurrence after successful AP ablation in patients with WPW syndrome.

### Adenosine [^115V8uTk]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2017). High credibility.

In controlled studies conducted in the United States, bolus doses of 3, 6, 9, and 12 mg were investigated. A cumulative 60% of patients with paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT) converted to normal sinus rhythm within one minute following an intravenous bolus dose of 6 mg adenosine (some converted with 3 mg, and failures were administered 6 mg). A cumulative 92% converted following a bolus dose of 12 mg. In contrast, only 7 to 16% of patients converted after 1 to 4 placebo bolus injections. Similar responses were observed across various patient subsets, including those using or not using digoxin, as well as individuals with Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome, regardless of gender or ethnicity (males, females, blacks, Caucasians, and Hispanics).

It is important to note that adenosine is not effective in converting rhythms other than PSVT, such as atrial flutter, atrial fibrillation, or ventricular tachycardia, to normal sinus rhythm.

### Surgical treatment of Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome: Resuscitation of a forgotten technique [^112x7AwZ]. JTCVS Techniques (2023). Low credibility.

The patient is a 27-year-old man with a history of Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome and two prior unsuccessful catheter ablation attempts. He presented with cardiac arrest due to ventricular fibrillation. He was successfully resuscitated and, after recovery, was noted to have an ejection fraction of 20% with an electrocardiogram showing a short PR interval and a delta wave. Electrophysiology mapping indicated a posterior-septal accessory pathway. Multiple attempts to ablate the accessory pathway endocardially and via the middle cardiac vein were unsuccessful. One additional attempt at catheter ablation via both endocardial and epicardial mapping was also unsuccessful.

In view of resuscitation from ventricular fibrillation due to rapid atrial fibrillation conducting rapidly over the accessory pathway, the patient was referred for surgical ablation.

- **Preoperative electrocardiogram**: A preoperative electrocardiogram showed a short PR interval and preexcitation, indicated by a delta wave.

- **Postoperative findings**: A five-year postoperative electrocardiogram showed a normal PR interval and the absence of preexcitation.

### Efficacy of nifekalant in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome and atrial fibrillation: Electrophysiological and clinical findings [^111m6W3b]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

Electrophysiological effects of nifekalant on AVN conduction in patients with AF but no AP were determined. Nifekalant infusion terminated AF in 33 of 87 (38%) patients, while 54 of 87 (62%) patients continued to have AF after 30 minutes of nifekalant treatment. The mean age of the group without AF termination was 58 ± 13 years, ranging from 18 to 74 years, and included 32 males.

Among these patients:

- **Structural heart conditions**: 20 of 54 patients (37%) had structural heart diseases and a low left ventricular ejection fraction (37 ± 5%).

- **Ventricular rates (beats/min)**:
	- **Baseline**: 97 ± 17
	- **After infusion**: 97 ± 16 (1 min), 99 ± 18 (3 min), 101 ± 20 (5 min), 103 ± 22 (7 min), 104 ± 24 (10 min), 102 ± 21 (15 min), 96 ± 19 (20 min), 95 ± 15 (30 min)

Nifekalant did not significantly decrease the mean ventricular rate of AF in the absence of an AP (97 ± 17 versus 95 ± 15 beats/min, n = 54, P = 0.22). A trend toward an increased ventricular rate was noted from infusion time 0 to 10 minutes and a trend toward a decrease from 10 to 30 minutes of the infusion period.

Additionally, the mean SBP in patients with AF but no AP did not change with nifekalant infusion (106 ± 16 versus 109 ± 17 mm Hg, n = 54, P = 0.30). Notably, no instances of TdP occurred in these patients during nifekalant infusion.

### 2023 ACC/AHA/ACCP/HRS guideline for the diagnosis and management of atrial fibrillation: A report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^111kWapd]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

For patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and chronic kidney disease (CKD), the 2024 ACC/ACCP/AHA/HRS guidelines recommend considering the initiation of warfarin (INR 2.0–3.0) or an evidence-based dose of apixaban for oral anticoagulation. This is advised to reduce the risk of stroke in patients with AF who are at elevated risk for stroke and have end-stage CKD (CrCl < 15 mL/min) or are on dialysis.

### Impact of adenosine on wavefront propagation in persistent atrial fibrillation: Insights from global noncontact charge density mapping of the left atrium [^112RHCf6]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Low credibility.

Our results suggest that rotational activation, in contrast with focal firing, is much more influenced by adenosine. Adenosine allows for a higher density of rotating wavefronts at spatially variable sites throughout the left atrium and a shorter global cycle length with an increase in DF. The degree of rotational activation may serve as a surrogate measure of individual atrial functional properties, with little evidence that rotational activation seen with adenosine represents promising targets for ablation aimed at arrhythmogenic sources of AF perpetuation within the left atrium, particularly as there is little stability of LRA sites within patients. Caution should be exercised when interpreting maps obtained after adenosine administration to guide nonpulmonary vein ablation.
