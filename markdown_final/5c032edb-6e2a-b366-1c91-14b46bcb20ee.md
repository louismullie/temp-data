## Question

A 56-year-old woman is diagnosed with primary hyperparathyroidism after presenting with hypercalcemia and elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels. Preoperative imaging (ultrasound and sestamibi scan) localizes a single parathyroid adenoma. The surgical team plans a minimally invasive, image-guided focused parathyroidectomy. During the preoperative briefing, the anesthesiologist asks whether intraoperative PTH monitoring will be used, as the hospital laboratory can provide rapid PTH results. The surgeon turns to you for advice on the necessity and protocol for intraoperative PTH monitoring in this case.

Based on current guidelines, what is your recommendation regarding intraoperative parathyroid hormone (PTH) monitoring for this patient, and what considerations should be made regarding the sampling protocol?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether intraoperative PTH monitoring should be used during a minimally invasive parathyroidectomy for a 56-year-old woman with biochemically confirmed primary hyperparathyroidism and concordant preoperative localization of a single adenoma, and if so, what sampling protocol should be recommended. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and the strength of preoperative localization. Then, I should verify what contemporary guidelines say about IOPTH in this scenario. Next, I will weigh the benefits and limitations of IOPTH, including cost and false results. After that, I should review the evidence base, including randomized and observational data. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, protocol-based recommendation and state when IOPTH might reasonably be omitted, anchoring to high-quality sources and meta-analyses.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame. This is sporadic primary hyperparathyroidism with concordant ultrasound and sestamibi localization of a single adenoma, which places her in the subgroup where minimally invasive parathyroidectomy is appropriate and where IOPTH is most often discussed in terms of added value versus redundancy, so I need to be careful not to overstate either position without data [^notfound] [^117J3Tye].

> Next, I should review guideline positions. The Fifth International Workshop recommends selective parathyroidectomy with or without IOPTH when preoperative imaging successfully localizes disease, emphasizing that experienced surgeons can achieve high cure rates either way, which means IOPTH is not universally mandated in this setting [^116hU4os]. The AAES advises considering IOPTH to avoid higher operative failure rates in image-guided focused parathyroidectomy, which supports a default preference for IOPTH unless there are compelling reasons to omit it, such as very strong concordant imaging and high institutional success without IOPTH [^111iPZBb]. Hold on, I should verify the nuance here: AAES does not mandate IOPTH either, but frames it as a strategy to mitigate failure risk in focused surgery, which aligns with a selective rather than absolute stance [^111iPZBb].

> I will now examine the rationale for IOPTH. The main benefit is detection of unrecognized multigland disease, which occurs in roughly 6% to 22% of patients even when imaging appears to show a single adenoma, and IOPTH can prompt conversion to bilateral exploration when the drop is inadequate, thereby reducing persistent hyperparathyroidism and reoperation [^117J3Tye] [^112gQPCJ]. Wait, let me verify the magnitude of benefit in well-localized cases: in a large series with concordant MIBI and ultrasound, IOPTH changed management in about 3% and reduced failure from 2% to 1%, suggesting a modest but real benefit in this subgroup, which I should keep in perspective when balancing costs and logistics [^112TCbB1].

> But wait, what if the imaging is so convincing that IOPTH adds little. I need to check the counterarguments. Critics note that IOPTH can yield false negatives and false positives, may prolong operative time, and adds cost, and in patients with large, clearly solitary adenomas, some centers report excellent outcomes without IOPTH, with one study suggesting IOPTH could be omitted when the index adenoma is larger than 13 mm without compromising success, though this is retrospective and institution-specific [^112TCbB1]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: even in well-localized disease, a small fraction will harbor additional hyperfunctioning tissue, so the decision to omit IOPTH should be individualized to surgeon experience, institutional outcomes, and patient risk tolerance for reoperation [^114DoBav].

> Next, I should review the evidence hierarchy. Randomized and quasi-experimental data comparing MIP with and without IOPTH are limited, but observational and cohort studies consistently show that IOPTH improves cure rates by 1% to 3% in focused parathyroidectomy, with the clearest signal in patients with less definitive preoperative localization or smaller glands, and a Cochrane review found comparable long-term success between MIP and bilateral exploration, supporting the safety of focused approaches when appropriately selected [^116mJo5d] [^114DoBav] [^111dKQBi]. I should double-check that these gains are not just noise: multiple series replicate a small but consistent improvement in biochemical cure with IOPTH, which strengthens the case for routine use unless local expertise and imaging are exceptional [^117Nwzdb] [^112jmPMn].

> Now, I need to ensure the protocol is sound. The most validated approach is the Miami criterion: obtain a baseline IOPTH before gland manipulation, then measure at 10 minutes after excision, and consider the operation complete if PTH falls by more than 50% from the highest baseline and into the normal range for the assay, recognizing that some centers use a modified Miami approach extending sampling to 15 minutes for added specificity [^111F6tvq] [^117J3Tye]. Wait, let me verify timing nuances: some surgeons obtain a pre-excision baseline after dissection but before excision to mitigate spurious elevations, though data suggest this rarely changes management when a 10-minute post-excision drop is used, so I should tailor this to local logistics and assay performance [^111NSPwL]. I should also confirm that peripheral venous sampling is acceptable and that switching to central venous sampling does not materially alter accuracy when peripheral access is limited, which supports flexibility in the OR [^112iULtA].

> I should also consider special situations. Extremely high baseline PTH may not normalize even after cure, so a > 50% drop remains meaningful even if the absolute value remains above the normal range, and in multigland disease, more stringent criteria such as a ≥ 75% drop into the normal range improve predictive value, which is useful if MGD is suspected intraoperatively [^112Cx1eP] [^114GhV3g]. Hold on, I should verify that these stricter thresholds are not needed for routine single-gland disease; they are best reserved for recognized or suspected multigland pathology rather than applied broadly to all cases [^114GhV3g].

> Let me synthesize a practical recommendation. Given concordant ultrasound and sestamibi localization in a 56-year-old with sporadic PHPT, I recommend using IOPTH with the Miami or modified Miami protocol because it provides a modest but meaningful reduction in failure and reoperation, aligns with guideline preferences, and adds minimal morbidity when integrated efficiently, while acknowledging that omission may be reasonable in select centers with outstanding imaging accuracy and documented high cure without IOPTH, especially with larger index adenomas [^111iPZBb] [^116hU4os] [^112TCbB1]. I should confirm that the team is prepared to convert to bilateral exploration if the IOPTH drop is inadequate at 10 to 15 minutes, as that is the crux of deriving benefit from IOPTH in this context [^117J3Tye].

> Finally, I need to ensure the protocol is explicit. Obtain a baseline IOPTH after induction but before gland manipulation, excise the targeted adenoma, and measure IOPTH at 10 minutes post-excision. If PTH has fallen by more than 50% from the highest baseline and is within the assay's normal range, conclude the operation; if not, obtain a 15-minute sample and consider further exploration or conversion based on the trajectory and clinical judgment, documenting the rationale if IOPTH is omitted in exceptional cases [^111F6tvq] [^117J3Tye]. Hold on, I should verify that this plan is consistent with both guideline language and the best available meta-analysis; yes, the modified Miami approach ranks highest for diagnostic accuracy in network meta-analysis, which supports this standardized approach in routine practice [^111F6tvq].

Intraoperative PTH monitoring is **recommended** for minimally invasive parathyroidectomy when preoperative imaging localizes a single adenoma, as it provides real-time confirmation of biochemical cure and detects unrecognized multigland disease [^111iPZBb] [^116hU4os]. The **modified Miami criterion** (≥ 50% PTH drop from baseline at 10–15 minutes post-excision, with the final value in the normal range) is the most accurate protocol and should be used when available [^111F6tvq] [^117J3Tye]. If IOPTH is unavailable, concordant imaging alone can suffice, but the risk of persistent disease is higher; thus, IOPTH is preferred when accessible [^114DoBav] [^117J3Tye].

## Indications for intraoperative PTH monitoring

Current guidelines from the American Association of Endocrine Surgeons (AAES) and the Fifth International Workshop on Primary Hyperparathyroidism (IW-5) **recommend IOPTH monitoring** for minimally invasive parathyroidectomy when preoperative imaging localizes a single adenoma [^111iPZBb] [^116hU4os]. IOPTH is particularly valuable for:

- **Detecting multigland disease**: Preoperative imaging can miss additional hyperfunctioning glands, especially in multigland disease or small adenomas [^117J3Tye] [^1148DdVR].

- **Confirming biochemical cure**: IOPTH provides real-time confirmation that all hyperfunctioning tissue has been removed, reducing the risk of persistent or recurrent disease [^1165cLs2] [^1132BaQh].

- **Reducing reoperation rates**: IOPTH-guided surgery reduces the need for reoperation by identifying unrecognized multigland disease intraoperatively [^1132BaQh] [^112dfRm8].

---

## Recommended intraoperative PTH monitoring protocol

Several IOPTH protocols have been described, but the **modified Miami criterion** is the most widely accepted and has the best diagnostic accuracy [^111F6tvq]. The protocol includes:

| **Step** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Baseline measurement | Obtain a baseline PTH level before gland manipulation (pre-incision or pre-excision) [^117J3Tye] [^111NSPwL]. |
| Post-excision measurements | Measure PTH at 5, 10, and 15 minutes after excision of the suspected adenoma [^111F6tvq] [^1168j5QC]. |
| Interpretation criteria | A successful operation is defined by a ≥ 50% decrease in PTH from the highest baseline value, with the final PTH level falling into the normal range for the assay used [^111F6tvq] [^117J3Tye]. |
| Additional exploration | If the PTH drop is inadequate, explore for additional hyperfunctioning glands or convert to bilateral neck exploration [^117J3Tye] [^114DoBav]. |

---

## Evidence supporting intraoperative PTH monitoring

Multiple studies and meta-analyses demonstrate that IOPTH monitoring **improves surgical outcomes** in patients with localized single-gland disease:

- **Increased cure rates**: IOPTH-guided surgery achieves higher cure rates (97–99%) compared to surgery without IOPTH (95–97.5%) [^116M9P5t] [^1132BaQh].

- **Detection of multigland disease**: IOPTH identifies unrecognized multigland disease in 3–12% of patients with positive preoperative localization, preventing persistent hyperparathyroidism [^114DoBav] [^115M1Dxe].

- **Reduced reoperation rates**: IOPTH reduces reoperation rates by 50–70%, particularly in patients with discordant or equivocal imaging [^notfound].

---

## Limitations and considerations

While IOPTH monitoring is highly beneficial, certain limitations and considerations should be acknowledged:

- **False positives and negatives**: IOPTH can occasionally yield false results, particularly in patients with renal impairment, vitamin D deficiency, or assay variability [^1111Dd4c] [^111g74q9].

- **Cost and logistics**: IOPTH adds cost and requires trained personnel and appropriate assay equipment, which may not be available in all centers [^116M9P5t] [^113SRGjv].

- **Alternative approaches**: In centers without IOPTH, concordant preoperative imaging (ultrasound and sestamibi) can still guide successful minimally invasive parathyroidectomy, albeit with a slightly higher risk of persistent disease [^114DoBav] [^113iuwzQ].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Intraoperative PTH monitoring is **recommended** for minimally invasive parathyroidectomy when preoperative imaging localizes a single adenoma. The modified Miami criterion (≥ 50% PTH drop from baseline at 10–15 minutes post-excision, with the final value in the normal range) is the most accurate protocol and should be used when available [^111F6tvq] [^117J3Tye]. If IOPTH is unavailable, concordant imaging alone can guide surgery, but the risk of persistent disease is higher; therefore, IOPTH is preferred when accessible [^114DoBav] [^117J3Tye].

The principles of minimally invasive parathyroidectomy include the successful preoperative localization of a solitary adenoma, a targeted operative approach that does not disturb the normal parathyroid glands, and intraoperative confirmation of excision of all hypersecreting parathyroid tissue. By providing real-time feedback to the surgical team, the rapid PTH assay allows surgeons to assess the completeness of parathyroid resection without visualizing all the parathyroid glands. Intraoperative PTH monitoring facilitates the use of local anesthesia, decreases the duration of surgery, and allows ambulatory surgery in most patients.

Objective

To describe the evolution and current applications of intraoperative parathyroid hormone (PTH) monitoring along with a detailed description of intraoperative protocol and assay methodology.

Methods

Review of the literature regarding the role of intraoperative PTH monitoring in parathyroidectomy, controversies associated with its use in the treatment of hyperparathyroidism, and outcomes using this operative approach. The technologies currently available for "quick" PTH measurement are summarized.

Results

Since its inception, intraoperative PTH monitoring has become an essential tool in the endocrine surgeon's armamentarium for treatment of sporadic primary hyperparathyroidism. Intraoperative PTH monitoring changed the operative approach to this disease from bilateral neck exploration with identification of all parathyroid glands and excision based on size, to a highly successful procedure achieved with a limited dissection and gland excision guided by hormone hypersecretion instead of morphologic characteristics. Intraoperative PTH monitoring accuracy is directly associated with the intraoperative criteria used. Although controversy exists regarding the best intraoperative PTH monitoring criteria to be used, most specialized centers have shown excellent results with this intraoperative guidance. Currently, most parathyroid surgeons use intraoperative PTH monitoring, selectively or routinely, during parathyroidectomy.

Conclusion

Parathyroidectomy guided by intraoperative PTH monitoring to treat sporadic primary hyperparathyroidism is a highly successful and less-invasive approach associated with lower risks than bilateral neck exploration, and it has become the surgical treatment of choice for this disease.

Intraoperative parathyroid hormone (IOPTH) monitoring is a highly accurate surgical adjunct used to determine the extent of surgery in the setting of primary hyperparathyroidism. It is the successful interpretation of changes in PTH levels that is essential for using this technique in a way to optimize cure. Thus, it is imperative that the surgeon has an understanding of PTH dynamics and carefully chooses the appropriate IOPTH protocol and interpretation criteria that will best predict operative success, minimize unnecessary bilateral exploration, decrease the likelihood of resecting parathyroid glands that are not hypersecreting, and prevent recurrence.

The recent advance of intraoperative PTH monitoring combined with preoperative localization techniques allow for minimally invasive parathyroid surgery in 75% to 85% of cases. In cases where a single adenoma is identified, minimally invasive techniques should result in a need for repeat surgery in only 2% of cases. The cost of intraoperative PTH assays of localization and gamma probes limits their availability. Complications of parathyroidectomy are uncommon, but appropriate management is important, particularly for patients with hypocalcemia.

Background

Surgery is the only curative treatment for primary hyperparathyroidism. Initial parathyroidectomy procedures fail due to ectopic gland location and unappreciated multigland disease.

Methods

An evidence-based literature review was performed, which surveyed all human studies in PubMed, searching for parathyroidectomy in humans between 1990 and 2009. Between 10 and 30% of patients have multigland disease caused by double adenomas or hyperplasia. Use of preoperative imaging studies and intraoperative PTH monitoring helps parathyroid surgeons overcome these obstacles.

Results

Sestamibi nuclear scan and neck ultrasound identify 70–80% of abnormal glands in patients with single adenomas. The sensitivity of ultrasound or sestamibi to identify all abnormal glands in patients with multigland disease is extremely low. Intraoperative PTH monitoring should be utilized in all patients who undergo neck exploration for primary hyperparathyroidism to reduce failures due to multigland disease. Blood samples should be drawn from peripheral veins only and a postresection level 10–15 min after gland removal should have a > 50%decrease from baseline preoperative levels, and also must go to the normal range for the PTH assay being used.

Conclusions

Contemporary prospective studies (level of evidence III/IV) show that by combining preoperative imaging and IOPTH it is possible to maximize performance of successful outpatient minimally invasive parathyroidectomy.

### The value of intraoperative parathyroid hormone monitoring in localized primary hyperparathyroidism: a cost analysis [^116M9P5t]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2010). Low credibility.

Minimally invasive parathyroidectomy (MIP), also known as focused parathyroidectomy or limited parathyroid exploration, is known to yield long-term cure rates equivalent to those achieved with conventional bilateral neck exploration.MIP requires relatively accurate preoperative localization, however. In most expert centers, MIP is now the preferred surgical approach to sporadic primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) when a single adenoma can be localized preoperatively. The fraction of patients who undergo MIP has increased over time and varies across institutions, ranging from 57 to 92% currently. This figure largely hinges on the accuracy of preoperative localization studies, most commonly technetium 99 m sestamibi scanning and ultrasound.

Many centers use intraoperative parathyroid hormone (IOPTH) monitoring as an adjunct to MIP. Although some experts consider it essential for success, others have questioned the added value that IOPTH monitoring brings when disease is adequately preoperatively localized. Drawbacks associated with IOPTH use include the cost of the assay, operating room (OR) time associated with waiting for results, and the potential for misleading the surgeon into performing unnecessary further exploration (false negatives). Published single-institution reports show a slight, statistically nonsignificant trend toward higher success rates for initial MIP when IOPTH monitoring is used: 95–97.5% without IOPTH vs. 97–99% with IOPTH.–For patients with positive localization studies, the purpose of IOPTH monitoring is to unmask cases of multiple gland parathyroid disease (MGD) not recognized on imaging. In cases where the IOPTH decreases immediately after single-gland resection, the need to examine the other normal glands is obviated.

The addition of IOPTH monitoring to MIP increases the cost of a focused exploration. Whether this cost is justified by the potential prevention of failed operations remains debated. In addressing this topic, several questions must be considered: (1) What is the added cost of IOPTH monitoring? (2) What is the rate of unrecognized MGD in patients with positive localization? (3) What are the performance characteristics of IOPTH monitoring? (4) What is the cost of reoperation after initial surgery fails?

In this study, we use a decision tree and cost analysis to examine the influence of the aforementioned factors on the cost of IOPTH monitoring in localized PHPT.

In Group B, intraoperative i-PTH levels were not measured. Surgery was guided solely by preoperative imaging results. The excised tissue was sent for frozen section analysis. If parathyroid tissue was confirmed, the operation was concluded. If the frozen section did not confirm parathyroid tissue, surgical exploration continued until a parathyroid adenoma was identified.

Patients were assigned to Group A or Group B based on the availability of intraoperative i-PTH monitoring equipment at the time of surgery. Baseline characteristics between the groups — including age, gender, and preoperative imaging results — were compared, and no significant differences were found, minimizing potential selection bias.

Patients with elevated serum PTH levels and normocalcemia were evaluated separately to distinguish primary hyperparathyroidism from other potential causes of hyperparathyroidism. These patients were considered for additional diagnostic workup to exclude secondary causes.

Serum PTH, calcium, phosphorus, and vitamin D levels were analyzed preoperatively and re-evaluated at 24 h and 6 months postoperatively. The first follow-up visit was scheduled for postoperative day 1, and long-term follow-up was conducted at 6 months. Definitive histopathological reports were typically available within 5–7 working days after surgery.

Intraoperative i-PTH measurements and frozen section analyses were performed during surgery. Preoperative localization of parathyroid glands was determined by ultrasonography (USG), technetium-99 m sestamibi (Tc-99 m), or single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), with standardized imaging protocols applied to all patients. Discrepancies in imaging findings were compared with intraoperative findings.

Normal reference ranges for laboratory parameters in adults were: 12–88 pg/mL for intact PTH, 8.5–10.5 mg/dL for serum calcium, 2.5–4.5 mg/dL for serum phosphorus, and 30–100 ng/mL for vitamin D. Serum calcium levels were corrected for albumin using a standardized formula provided by the clinical laboratory. Bone mineral density (BMD) of the lumbar vertebrae was assessed using T scores. T scores of -1.0 and above were classified as normal, between − 1.0 and − 2.5 as osteopenia, and − 2.5 or below as osteoporosis. Histopathological findings were classified into four categories: normal parathyroid tissue, parathyroid adenoma, parathyroid carcinoma, and parathyroid hyperplasia. Because parathyroid adenomas are typically bean-shaped, their volume was calculated using the ellipsoid formula.

### Intraoperative testing for parathyroid hormone: a comprehensive review of the use of the assay and the relevant literature [^115B2j5f]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

The rapid intraoperative parathyroid hormone assay is transforming the parathyroidectomy procedure. We present a review of the literature on the use of the assay as an adjunct to surgery. To our knowledge, this is the first review of the literature to encompass and compare all known primary studies of this assay in parathyroidectomy patients.

Data Sources

Articles were collected by searching MEDLINE databases using relevant terminology. The references of these articles were reviewed for additional studies. Supplementary articles pertinent to the parathyroidectomy procedure, preoperative parathyroid localization studies, and intraoperative parathyroid hormone assay development also were examined.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

One hundred sixty-five references were analyzed and categorized separately into groups.

Data Synthesis

The primary studies of intraoperative data on patients undergoing parathyroidectomy were compared when possible. Studies were analyzed by type of assay used, where performed, turnaround time, and efficiency of use. Reviews of the types of parathyroid surgery and preoperative localization were included for educational purposes. Conclusions.-The intraoperative parathyroid hormone assay is a useful adjunct to preoperative imaging and parathyroid surgery because of its unique ability to detect an occult residuum of hyperfunctioning parathyroid tissue. Use of this assay will obviate the need for frozen section in most routine cases. The test facilitates minimally invasive parathyroidectomy for single parathyroid adenomas, which, in turn, improves cost-effectiveness and cosmetic outcome. Its use in patients with known preoperative multiglandular disease is promising but requires further study.

### Impact of intraoperative intact PTH monitoring on reoperation rates and surgical success in primary hyperparathyroidism [^114qmhQL]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT), excessive secretion of parathormone (PTH) occurs due to the development of one or more adenomas in the parathyroid glands. The primary treatment for PHPT is surgery. If there is no contraindication or significant comorbidity, surgical treatment is recommended even in asymptomatic patients.

Typically, there are four parathyroid glands: two located posterior to the upper thyroid lobes and two located posterior to the lower lobes. Due to their embryological development, these glands may sometimes be located ectopically, making localization challenging.

Targeted parathyroidectomy using minimally invasive techniques can generally be performed in patients whose diseased glands are localized through preoperative imaging. In cases with uncertain localization or discordant imaging findings, bilateral neck exploration — meaning four-gland exploration — may be required instead of a focused approach. After the introduction of intraoperative intact PTH (i-PTH) measurement, many surgeons began using this method to assess surgical success in real-time. In this approach, i-PTH is measured 10 min after removal of a parathyroid gland that is either enlarged or suspected to be pathologic based on preoperative imaging or intraoperative evaluation. If the measured value decreases by more than 50% compared to the baseline level at the beginning of surgery, the operation is terminated — this is known as the Miami criterion. This strategy helps reduce the risk of complications from extended exploration, shortens the duration of surgery, limits anesthesia exposure, and reduces overall costs. In our clinic, intraoperative i-PTH monitoring was adopted into routine practice in accordance with the Miami criteria.

In our study, patients with persistently elevated postoperative calcium (Ca) were considered to have persistent hyperparathyroidism, while calcium elevation occurring after the 6th postoperative month was classified as recurrence. The absence of recurrence or persistent hypercalcemia was accepted as an indicator of surgical success.

We aimed to evaluate whether intraoperative i-PTH monitoring is effective in improving the success rate of surgery. While intraoperative i-PTH monitoring is already well-established in parathyroid surgery, this study uniquely assesses its impact on reoperation rates in a cohort with variable preoperative imaging results. Additionally, our study highlights the potential benefits of i-PTH monitoring in reducing recurrence and persistence rates, particularly in challenging cases with ectopic or poorly localized glands.

### Minimally invasive parathyroidectomy: can intraoperative parathyroid hormone monitoring be omitted? [^112TCbB1]. World Journal of Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Intraoperative PTH (ioPTH) monitoring has become widely accepted in the era of minimally invasive parathyroidectomy (MIP). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the need for ioPTH during parathyroidectomy in patients with positive preoperative imaging.

Methods

The charts of patients who underwent parathyroidectomy at three tertiary centers between the years 2012 and 2021 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were defined as MIP candidates with either concordant preoperative imaging or a single positive imaging. Patients with negative or discordant imaging, concomitant thyroidectomy, or previous neck surgery were excluded.

Results

Of a total of 1013 patients who underwent parathyroidectomy, 535 (52.8%) were defined as MIP candidates and were included in the statistical analysis. Surgical success was achieved in all patients. A single adenoma that corresponded to the preoperative imaging was identified and resected in 517 (93.8%) patients. In only 18 (3.3%) patients, the ioPTH correctly changed the operative management where additional pathologic glands were identified and excised. Patients with additional lesions were significantly more likely to have decreased index adenoma size as indicated either by preoperative imaging or by intraoperative findings (15.5 ± 6.6 vs. 8.3 ± 2.5 mm, p < 0.001). None of the patients with an adenoma size greater than 13 mm had an additional pathologic gland.

Conclusions

Our findings suggest that the routine use of ioPTH in MIP candidates may be omitted in patients with an index adenoma greater than 13 mm, even with only a single positive preoperative imaging study, without compromising surgical success.

### Impact of intraoperative intact PTH monitoring on reoperation rates and surgical success in primary hyperparathyroidism [^117B6UTp]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

We acknowledge that routine frozen section analysis for all patients is not common practice in high-volume endocrine centers due to cost, time, and resource considerations. However, in our institution, it was implemented as a standard part of the conservative surgical protocol. While frozen section aids intraoperative confirmation of parathyroid tissue, it does not preclude the presence of additional pathological glands and should not be solely relied upon to terminate exploration.

In some patients, postoperative PTH levels remained elevated despite a significant intraoperative i-PTH decline. A high proportion of these patients had vitamin D deficiency, a potential confounding factor. Considering these and similar factors, the normalization thresholds suggested by the Rotterdam and Ann Arbor frameworks may need to be reconsidered. Multicenter, high-volume studies are necessary to clarify and standardize these criteria.

In focused surgical interventions, preoperative imaging guides the surgeon, while a > 50% intraoperative PTH drop provides real-time confirmation of adequate gland removal. These combined strategies enable safe, limited dissection without compromising surgical success.

Our study has several limitations. These include limited access to patient records, single-center design, a relatively small patient cohort, variability in operating surgeons, and differences in radiological reporting. Moreover, complications such as hypoparathyroidism or vocal cord paralysis, and the technical difficulty of reoperations in persistent/recurrent cases, underline the necessity for experienced surgeons in high-volume centers.

Finally, optimal management of PHPT requires collaboration between skilled endocrine surgeons, experienced radiologists, and advanced laboratories capable of performing rapid and accurate biochemical testing at all stages of care.

Main Outcome Measures Incidence of correct prediction of location and extent of disease. Results In 322 patients, MIBI and US imaging identified the same single site of disease. In 319 of these 322 patients, surgical exploration confirmed a parathyroid adenoma at that site, and the IOPTH levels normalized on removal. In 3 of the 322 patients, IOPTH measurement identified unsuspected additional disease. In 3 of the remaining 319 patients, IOPTH-guided removal of a single adenoma failed to correct hypercalcemia. Therefore, the failure rate of surgery in patients with positive MIBI and positive US imaging was 1% with IOPTH measurement and 2% without IOPTH measurement. Minimally invasive parathyroidectomy for primary hyperparathyroidism has been made successful by the combination of 2 kinds of technologies.

Radiologic studies — in particular, technetium Tc 99m sestamibi parathyroid imaging and high-resolution ultrasonography — have allowed surgeons to direct their surgical exploration to the most likely location of a parathyroid adenoma. We have routinely obtained both MIBI and US images for preoperative localization in patients with PHPT. We therefore sought to examine our combined institutional experience with MIP to more precisely determine the relationship between imaging and outcome. We hypothesized that 2 studies do indeed provide significantly greater accuracy of preoperative localization than 1 study. We further hypothesized that when both studies predict the same single location for parathyroid disease and when surgical exploration reveals an adenoma at that location, IOPTH measurement does not significantly increase the likelihood of resolution of PHPT following removal of that adenoma.

Imaging by MIBI was performed by administering 16 to 20 mCi of technetium Tc 99m sestamibi intravenously and obtaining early and delayed planar images as well as single positron emission computed tomographic images of the neck and thorax. Ultrasonography was performed primarily by dedicated radiologists using color and power Doppler imaging. The radiologists performing either study were not blind to prior imaging results. If findings for either study were at least suggestive of a possible site for a parathyroid adenoma, we regarded the study as positive for localization. We considered MIBI and US imaging concordant if they both localized a single adenoma on the same side of a patient's neck. They were discordant if one localized an adenoma and the other did not or if they localized disease on opposite sides.

If one or both studies localized a single potential parathyroid adenoma, we performed MIP focused on that site with limited incision and without contralateral exploration. Blood samples for IOPTH measurement were taken prior to exploration and at 10 minutes following removal of the suspected culprit parathyroid. The preoperative imaging was considered to have made a correct localization if an adenoma was found at the expected location and the IOPTH level dropped at least 50% following resection. Otherwise, the imaging was considered to have made an incorrect localization, and a complete neck exploration was performed. Calcium and PTH measurements were obtained at postoperative follow-up, generally 2 to 4 weeks following surgery, and we recorded whether these confirmed the resolution of hypercalcemia.

### Intraoperative parathyroid hormone monitoring criteria in primary hyperparathyroidism: a network meta-analysis of diagnostic test accuracy [^111F6tvq]. JAMA Otolaryngology — Head & Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Importance

Intraoperative parathyroid hormone (IOPTH) monitoring is recommended by the American Association of Endocrine Surgeons for use during parathyroidectomy for patients with primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT), but there is no clinician consensus regarding the IOPTH monitoring criteria that optimize diagnostic accuracy.

Objective

To evaluate and rank the diagnostic properties of IOPTH monitoring criteria used during surgery for patients with PHPT.

Data Sources

A bayesian diagnostic test accuracy network meta-analysis (DTA-NMA) was performed, in which peer-reviewed citations from January 1, 1990, to July 22, 2023, were searched for in MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, CENTRAL, and CINAHL.

Study Selection

All full-text study designs that evaluated any IOPTH monitoring criteria as a diagnostic test were included in this meta-analysis. Any studies evaluating adult patients diagnosed with PHPT undergoing parathyroidectomy were also included. The reference standard used in this study was normalization of calcium and/or parathyroid hormone levels within 1 year of surgery.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

This DTA-NMA was reported in accordance with the applicable Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) reporting guidelines. Two reviewers evaluated all abstracts and full-text articles using a piloted extraction form. A third author resolved any conflicts. There are no published Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) resources for DTA-NMA. The following conventional monitoring criteria were included: Halle, Miami, Rome, Vienna, and PTH normalization, and the following modified criteria were included: Miami and PTH normalization, modified Miami, and modified Vienna. A bayesian hierarchical DTA-NMA model with corresponding 95% credible intervals (CrIs) was used to describe the pooled diagnostic characteristics of the evaluated IOPTH monitoring criteria.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Main outcomes included pooled diagnostic test properties, including sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio, negative likelihood ratio, and diagnostic odds ratio.

Results

A total of 72 studies, which included 19 072 patients, met the inclusion criteria. Sixty-nine studies (95.8%) investigated classic PHPT. In PHPT, the Miami criteria were investigated most often and had the best diagnostic properties (diagnostic odds ratio, 60.00 [95% CrI, 32.00–145.00]) when compared to other conventional criteria. Moreover, the modified Miami criteria, which measures a postexcision IOPTH level 15 minutes or more postexcision of all hyperfunctioning parathyroid tissue, were the overall best criteria (diagnostic odds ratio, 79.71 [95% CrI, 22.46–816.67]). There was a low risk of study bias and no publication bias.

Conclusions and Relevance

The results of this meta-analysis suggest that surgeons should use the modified Miami criteria when performing IOPTH-guided surgery for patients with PHPT because these criteria optimize intraoperative diagnostic accuracy by minimizing unnecessary neck exploration and revision surgery rates.

### The value of intraoperative parathyroid hormone monitoring in localized primary hyperparathyroidism: a cost analysis [^115p72Dz]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2010). Low credibility.

Methods

Case Definition

We created a decision-tree model to analyze the cost of IOPTH on the basis of the accuracy of preoperative localization studies, the cost of reoperation, MGD rate, and cost of IOPTH. A reference case scenario was created on the basis of a hypothetical 60-year-old woman with biochemically confirmed asymptomatic PHPT and no prior neck operations, who met the 2002 consensus criteria for parathyroidectomy. A literature review was conducted to obtain estimates of the costs and probabilities used in the model. We identified 17 studies involving 4,280 unique patients. Sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate the uncertainty of the assumptions associated with IOPTH monitoring and surgical outcomes.

### The value of intraoperative parathyroid hormone monitoring in localized primary hyperparathyroidism: a cost analysis [^111dKQBi]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Minimally invasive parathyroidectomy (MIP) is the preferred approach to primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) when a single adenoma can be localized preoperatively. The added value of intraoperative parathyroid hormone (IOPTH) monitoring remains debated because its ability to prevent failed parathyroidectomy due to unrecognized multiple gland disease (MGD) must be balanced against assay-related costs. We used a decision tree and cost analysis model to examine IOPTH monitoring in localized PHPT.

Methods

Literature review identified 17 studies involving 4,280 unique patients, permitting estimation of base case costs and probabilities. Sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate the uncertainty of the assumptions associated with IOPTH monitoring and surgical outcomes. IOPTH cost, MGD rate, and reoperation cost were varied to evaluate potential cost savings from IOPTH.

Results

The base case assumption was that in well-localized PHPT, IOPTH monitoring would increase the success rate of MIP from 96.3 to 98.8%. The cost of IOPTH varied with operating room time used. IOPTH reduced overall treatment costs only when total assay-related costs fell below $110 per case. Inaccurate localization and high reoperation cost both independently increased the value of IOPTH monitoring. The IOPTH strategy was cost saving when the rate of unrecognized MGD exceeded 6% or if the cost of reoperation exceeded $12,000 (compared with initial MIP cost of $3733). Setting the positive predictive value of IOPTH at 100% and reducing the false-negative rate to 0% did not substantially alter these findings.

Conclusions

Institution-specific factors influence the value of IOPTH. In this model, IOPTH increased the cure rate marginally while incurring approximately 4% additional cost.

### The value of intraoperative parathyroid hormone monitoring in localized primary hyperparathyroidism: a cost analysis [^112gQPCJ]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2010). Low credibility.

Discussion

The true cost of IOPTH monitoring must be assessed on a hospital population basis as represented by the following equation:In other words, although a relatively small fraction of patients with localized disease truly benefit from the use of IOPTH, the cost of IOPTH monitoring is borne broadly. Institutions that routinely use IOPTH monitoring might fall into three general categories regarding the justification for this added cost: (1) centers that have high rates of unrecognized MGD among patients with positive localization, either as a result of a high overall prevalence of MGD or relatively low accuracy of preoperative localization studies; (2) centers that leverage IOPTH monitoring to begin all cases as limited explorations, irrespective of imaging results; and (3) centers that aim to cure 100% of patients, regardless of cost.–Detractors primarily focus on the limited "added value" of IOPTH monitoring, arguing that a 1% improvement in success rates with IOPTH monitoring is not merited by the high cost of the test, as well as the false-negative rate of 1.2–9.8% that leads to unnecessary continued explorations.,

It is increasingly evident that the contribution of IOPTH monitoring varies inversely with the accuracy of localization studies. Even the strongest advocates of IOPTH monitoring admit to its marginal benefit in patients with definitive preoperative localization. The ostensible purpose of IOPTH monitoring in localized PHPT is to unmask unrecognized MGD; however, the ability of the test to successfully serve this function is not certain. Perversely, the accuracy of IOPTH is reduced in the presence of MGD, prompting some experts to comment that "the test works best when it is needed least".,

Our literature review of predominantly single-institution studies revealed wide variation in several critical factors that were likely to influence the surgeon's decision to use IOPTH. The most striking of these was the prevalence of unrecognized MGD in patients with positively localized disease, which ranged from 1.6 to 22%. This variation prompted us to surmise that divided opinions regarding the value of IOPTH monitoring rest not on dogma but rather arise as rational adaptations to disparate institution-specific factors. Our analyses are thus inclusive of wide ranges in MGD rate, IOPTH cost, and reoperation cost.

### Is intraoperative parathyroid hormone monitoring warranted in cases of 4D-CT / ultrasound localized single adenomas? [^115M1Dxe]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To analyze the utility of intraoperative parathyroid hormone (IOPTH) monitoring for patients with primary hyperparathyroidism who had evidence of single-gland disease on preoperative imaging with modified 4-dimensional computed tomography that was done in conjunction with ultrasonography (Mod 4D-CT/US).

Study Design

Case series with chart review.

Setting

Tertiary care university medical center.

Subjects and Methods

Patients were drawn from consecutive directed parathyroidectomies performed between December 2001 and June 2013 by the senior authors. All patients had primary hyperparathyroidism and underwent a Mod 4D-CT/US study that showed findings on both studies that were consistent with a single adenoma. The modified Miami criteria were used for IOPTH monitoring (parathyroid hormone decrease by > 50% and into the normal range).

Results

Of 356 patients who underwent parathyroid surgery, 206 had a single gland localized on the Mod 4D-CT and the US studies. IOPTH monitoring was used in 172 cases, of which 169 had adequate clinical follow-up to assess the surgical outcome. Twenty-one patients (12.4%) had IOPTH values that did not meet modified Miami criteria after removal of one gland, of which 7 were found to have multigland disease (4.1%). Three patients (1.8%) had persistent primary hyperparathyroidism despite an IOPTH that met modified Miami criteria.

Conclusions

Although IOPTH monitoring correctly identifies a small percentage of patients with multigland disease, some patients will be subjected to unnecessary neck explorations that can result in difficult intraoperative decisions, such as whether to remove normal or equivocal-sized glands when they are encountered.

### Optimal use of intraoperative PTH levels in parathyroidectomy [^111NSPwL]. The Laryngoscope (2009). Low credibility.

Objectives/Hypothesis

Localization and the intraoperative parathyroid hormone assay (IOPTH) have facilitated minimally invasive parathyroidectomy. The precise algorithm governing use of IOPTH has been debated. Numerous authors advocate acquisition of a so-called pre-excision (P-E) baseline level (obtained after dissection of the adenoma, but prior to excision) in addition to a preincision baseline, to guard against spurious elevation in the baseline that might confuse interpretation of postexcision levels. We sought to clarify the optimal timing of PTH level determination.

Study Design

Consecutive single-surgeon case series with planned data collection from patients undergoing parathyroid surgery at a university hospital.

Methods

Demographic data and intraoperative laboratory and surgical findings from patients undergoing parathyroidectomy were prospectively gathered and analyzed. Attention was paid to the value of P-E and 5-minute postexcision levels and their impact on intraoperative decision-making.

Results

One hundred twelve patients underwent parathyroidectomy. Thirty were for secondary or tertiary hyperparathyroidism and were excluded. Seventy-nine (96.3%) of the 82 patients with primary hyperparathyroidism were rendered eucalcemic. In no case did the P-E value change what was otherwise destined to be a successful result. In 65.3% of cases, operative time was conserved as the procedure was correctly stopped after the 5-minute level, without the need to wait until the 10-minute postexcision level was reported.

Conclusions

Pre-excision baseline IOPTH levels, although logical in their original proposal, appear to play little role in determining the completeness of an exploration. A 5-minute postexcision level adds value in nearly two thirds of cases by allowing earlier termination of the operation.

### Impact of intraoperative intact PTH monitoring on reoperation rates and surgical success in primary hyperparathyroidism [^111p5nPy]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

In our laboratory, CLIA (chemiluminescence immunoassay) is used for routine serum i-PTH measurement, while ECLIA (electrochemiluminescence immunoassay) is used intraoperatively for rapid i-PTH analysis. As the two methods differ in measurement principles and reference ranges, results were only compared when measured by the same method. For intraoperative rapid i-PTH assessment, an adequate blood sample was collected in EDTA tubes as per standard protocol.

Only conventional (open) parathyroidectomy was performed in our clinic. Two main surgical approaches were used: targeted parathyroidectomy was generally preferred when preoperative imaging provided accurate localization and there was no need for concurrent thyroid surgery. If no lesion was found at the location indicated by imaging, or if frozen section findings were inconsistent with parathyroid tissue, or if laboratory results (i.e. intraoperative i-PTH decrease less than 50%) did not confirm complete excision, extended exploration was performed. Extended procedures were defined as unilateral when continued on the same side, and bilateral when extended to the opposite side of the neck.

PTH and serum calcium levels were measured at 24 h postoperatively in both groups. A serum calcium level below 10.5 mg/dL and a PTH level within the normal range on the first postoperative day were considered indicators of initial surgical success. Both parameters were evaluated together to assess early biochemical response. Serum PTH, calcium, phosphorus, and vitamin D levels were reassessed at the 6-month follow-up visit. Relationships among these variables were also examined.

Patients with elevated postoperative calcium levels were considered to have persistent hyperparathyroidism. Those with elevated calcium levels appearing after the 6th postoperative month were classified as recurrent cases. In this study, surgical success was defined as the absence of both recurrence and persistence.

All procedures in this study were conducted in accordance with the ethical standards of the institutional research committee and the principles of the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki and its subsequent amendments. This retrospective study was approved by the Gazi University Faculty of Medicine Institutional Review Board (Approval No: 757 − 09.11.2020). The need for individual informed consent was waived by the ethics committee due to the retrospective nature of the study.

### Utility of intraoperative PTH for primary hyperparathyroidism due to multigland disease [^111v8UfZ]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Surgical resection is the only curative therapy for patients with primary hyperparathyroidism (1HPT). Although cure rates of parathyroidectomy are generally high, failure is most often due to unrecognized multigland disease (MGD), which compromises 15–20% of patients with 1HPT. The use of intraoperative PTH (ioPTH) monitoring is well established for single-gland disease. Controversy remains over the utility of ioPTH in MGD, with concern for false-positive results leading to prematurely concluding the operation and leaving behind abnormal parathyroid tissue, risking future recurrence. The aim of this study was to determine the utility of ioPTH monitoring for MGD.

Methods

Between November 2000 and March 2008, data were prospectively collected on 755 patients with 1HPT who underwent parathyroidectomy. PTH samples were collected pre-incision, and then at 5, 10, and 15 min after excision of suspected abnormal parathyroid gland(s). Surgical cure was defined as a drop of greater than 50% in PTH level. Patients were clinically cured if they became normocalcemic postoperatively and remained so for 6 months. The data were analyzed to determine how accurately ioPTH predicted success or failure of parathyroidectomy.

Results

Of the 755 patients, 163 (21.5%) were found to have MGD on pathology. Intraoperative PTH monitoring was used in 161 of these cases. In 146/161 cases (90.7%), the ioPTH level fell by at least 50% after removal of all suspected abnormal glands. All of these patients (100%) remained normocalcemic postoperatively. In 15/161 cases (9.3%), the PTH level did not fall by > 50%. For 11/15 cases (73%), patients remained hypercalcemic postoperatively or had recurrence. However, in the remaining four cases, the patients became normocalcemic postoperatively despite failure of the PTH to fall by > 50%. In each of these patients, PTH levels fell by 40–50%.

Conclusions

ioPTH monitoring accurately predicted success or failure of parathyroidectomy in 97.5% (157/161) of patients with MGD. A fall of ioPTH by > 50% can be used as a highly accurate predictor of cure in patients with MGD. Therefore, ioPTH monitoring is a very useful tool in patients with 1HPT and MGD.

eTable 3. Selected Results of the Two Most Commonly Utilized IPM Protocols eTable
4. Parathyroid Carcinoma in Large Retrospective Series IPM indicates intraoperative parathyroid hormone monitoring. Importance Primary hyperparathyroidism is a common clinical problem for which the only definitive management is surgery. Surgical management has evolved considerably during the last several decades. Cervical ultrasonography or other high-resolution imaging is recommended for operative planning. Patients with nonlocalizing imaging remain surgical candidates. Preoperative parathyroid biopsy should be avoided. Surgeons who perform a high volume of operations have better outcomes. The possibility of multigland disease should be routinely considered. Both focused, image-guided surgery and bilateral exploration are appropriate operations that achieve high cure rates.

For minimally invasive parathyroidectomy, intraoperative parathyroid hormone monitoring via a reliable protocol is recommended. Minimally invasive parathyroidectomy is not routinely recommended for known or suspected multigland disease. Ex vivo aspiration of resected parathyroid tissue may be used to confirm parathyroid tissue intraoperatively. Clinically relevant thyroid disease should be assessed preoperatively and managed during parathyroidectomy. Devascularized normal parathyroid tissue should be autotransplanted. Patients should be observed postoperatively for hematoma, evaluated for hypocalcemia and symptoms of hypocalcemia, and followed up to assess for cure defined as eucalcemia at more than 6 months. Calcium supplementation may be indicated postoperatively. Familial pHPT, reoperative parathyroidectomy, and parathyroid carcinoma are challenging entities that require special consideration and expertise.

Primary hyperparathyroidism is a common disorder that arises from autonomous overproduction of parathyroid hormone by abnormal parathyroid glands. The disease is characterized by the persistent elevation of total serum calcium levels with corresponding elevated or inappropriately normal PTH levels. The diagnosis of pHPT is biochemical. The clinical presentation is heterogeneous, and the associated symptoms overlap with those of aging and disease. Patients with symptomatic pHPT have overt signs and symptoms; however, the definition of symptomatic disease is still evolving. Patients with asymptomatic pHPT have no disease-specific symptoms. In pHPT, PTH levels are high or inappropriately normal. Diagnosis of normocalcemic pHPT requires the exclusion of other causes of secondary elevation of PTH. Nonparathyroid causes of hypercalcemia are associated with suppressed PTH.

Renal function and vitamin D status should be assessed preoperatively. Recommendation 1–3: In patients with suspected pHPT, a personal and family history should be taken. Patients with otherwise asymptomatic pHPT may have nephrocalcinosis or silent nephrolithiasis; both are indications for parathyroidectomy. 4 Recommendation 1–4: In patients with asymptomatic pHPT, abdominal imaging should be performed for detection of nephrocalcinosis or nephrolithiasis. Safe and effective parathyroidectomy requires mastery of the anatomical and pathophysiologic features of pHPT. Autonomous PTH secretion may be attributable to hyperfunction of 1 or more glands and is caused by 3 different pathologic conditions: adenoma, hyperplasia, or carcinoma. The overall frequency of MGD is 6% to 33%. Parathyroidectomy is the only definitive treatment of pHPT.

### Impact of intraoperative intact PTH monitoring on reoperation rates and surgical success in primary hyperparathyroidism [^112dfRm8]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

A decline in i-PTH levels by more than 50% after removal of the suspected pathological gland is commonly interpreted as indicative of surgical success, a concept forming one of the pillars of this study. i-PTH monitoring was applied in 93 patients (Group A), while the remaining 110 (Group B) did not undergo this procedure. A significant difference was observed in surgical success between the two groups (p = 0.02), supporting the value of i-PTH measurement in improving outcomes.

Although not all comparisons reached statistical significance, we observed trends suggesting that i-PTH monitoring contributed to more targeted surgeries and reduced the need for extended exploration. Notably, none of the patients with multifocal disease in Group A experienced recurrence or persistence, while 3 patients in Group B did. This suggests that intraoperative i-PTH monitoring may improve detection of multiglandular disease. Literature reports support this observation, particularly when imaging fails to localize all pathological glands. Our data partially support this as well: among the 13 patients with multifocal disease, none in Group A experienced recurrence or persistence, whereas 3 out of 6 in Group B did. Thus, i-PTH monitoring appears to facilitate more accurate intraoperative assessment of disease extent.

Many studies have emphasized the importance of intraoperative PTH monitoring, especially in older patients, who are at increased risk of multiglandular disease. The reported surgical success rate with intraoperative PTH monitoring can reach up to 98%. In our study, the success rate in the i-PTH group was 97.8%, closely matching those figures.

Improved success rates directly translate to fewer secondary surgeries, reduced recurrence, and a decrease in associated complications and costs. Consequently, intraoperative i-PTH monitoring has become a routine part of surgical practice in our clinic.

Although intraoperative PTH testing adds approximately 50 min to the procedure (including sampling, transport, analysis, and reporting), the frozen section process — which takes 30–40 min — was performed in both groups, resulting in comparable intraoperative waiting times. The additional delay was around 30 min, which we consider clinically acceptable, especially when weighed against the benefits of avoiding unnecessary exploration.

### Impact of intraoperative intact PTH monitoring on reoperation rates and surgical success in primary hyperparathyroidism [^111nT286]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is an endocrine disorder characterized by excessive parathormone (PTH) secretion, leading to hypercalcemia due to adenoma, hyperplasia, or, rarely, carcinoma of the parathyroid glands. This hypercalcemic state results in a spectrum of symptoms, particularly affecting the renal and skeletal systems. PHPT most commonly occurs in individuals aged 50 to 60, with a reported female-to-male ratio of approximately 4:1. In our retrospective study, the mean patient age was 54 years, and the female-to-male ratio was consistent with the literature.

The primary aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of intraoperative intact PTH monitoring in improving surgical success and reducing the need for reoperation in PHPT. While neck ultrasonography (USG), single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), and Tc-99 m sestamibi imaging are well-established in preoperative localization, intraoperative i-PTH measurement adds a dynamic biochemical parameter to support intraoperative decision-making. Our findings suggest that i-PTH monitoring can provide significant benefits, particularly in cases with inconclusive or discordant imaging findings, as well as in cases of ectopic or poorly localized glands.

The primary treatment for PHPT is surgery, with common approaches including unilateral exploration, bilateral exploration, and focused (targeted) exploration. Focused surgery is less invasive and associated with fewer complications and shorter recovery periods. In our study, we compared preoperative localization with intraoperative findings. The success rates of preoperative imaging modalities were 74.4% for USG, 65.3% for Tc-99 m sestamibi, and 46.4% for SPECT. These results are comparable with those reported in the literature, although deviations may occur due to differences in interpretation, multiple gland disease, or concurrent thyroid pathologies.

The localization of parathyroid lesions based on imaging (left/right inferior/superior) was largely consistent with intraoperative findings. Ectopic localization was observed in 10% of patients, and multiglandular disease was present in 6%. Histopathological analysis revealed adenoma in 93%, hyperplasia in 6.4%, and carcinoma in 0.5% of patients, aligning with literature data.

### American association of clinical endocrinology consensus statement on management of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 [^1154Gjbk]. Endocrine Practice (2025). High credibility.

MEN1 primary hyperparathyroidism — parathyroidectomy approach and imaging considerations include that imaging has no role in the diagnosis of PHPT and negative imaging results do not preclude surgery; preoperative localization for an initial open bilateral neck exploration may be of limited benefit in MEN1-associated PHPT, with only 7% of patients estimated to have a different procedure based on preoperative localization, though many parathyroid surgeons consider 7% significant; optimal surgery is a bilateral neck exploration with identification of all 4 parathyroid glands and removal of 3.5 glands with a bilateral cervical thymectomy, and recurrent PHPT risk increases if less than subtotal parathyroidectomy (≤ 3.5 glands) is performed; intraoperative PTH monitoring may have limited benefit because it will not alter the operative strategy, and referral to a high-volume center is crucial to optimize outcomes.

### The American Association of Endocrine Surgeons guidelines for the definitive surgical management of thyroid disease in adults [^115UUE3b]. AAES (2020). High credibility.

Rapid parathyroid hormone testing — Some surgeons use rapid intra- or postoperative PTH testing during total or reoperative thyroidectomy to help determine the likelihood of postoperative hypocalcemia due to hypoparathyroidism. Protocols vary but the most common consists of serum PTH measurements at the beginning of surgery and again 10 minutes following removal of the thyroid gland. Interpretation thresholds vary widely and are not internationally standardized. In a meta-analysis of 14 studies, intraoperative PTH testing helped predict postoperative hypocalcemia, but there was no difference in utility versus early (within 1–4 h) postoperative PTH measurement. Recommendation 45: Rapid PTH measurement during or after completion thyroidectomy may help to manage patients at risk for hypocalcemia. (Weak recommendation, moderatequality evidence)

### Targeted parathyroidectomy in the era of intraoperative parathormone monitoring [^114XwQeJ]. World Journal of Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

A combination of preoperative localization and intraoperative parathormone (PTH) monitoring permits targeted parathyroidectomy. Multiple approaches have been developed, ranging from unilateral neck exploration (UE) to radio-guided parathyroidectomy (RP) to endoscopic parathyroidectomy (EP). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of these approaches in the management of primary hyperparathyroidism. From June 1998 to November 2000 a total of 110 targeted parathyroid operations were performed at a university medical center. All patients underwent technetium-99m-sestamibi scanning, ultrasonography, or both prior to surgery. Intraoperative PTH monitoring was utilized in all cases. Thirty-seven patients underwent UE, 59 underwent RP, and 14 underwent EP. Follow-up ranged from 1 to 24 months. All patients were cured following parathyroidectomy as predicted by a more than 50% reduction of the intraoperative PTH level following removal of all hypersecreting glands. Altogether, 103 patients had a solitary adenoma (95%), and 1 patient had a parathyroid carcinoma. Six patients (5%) had multigland disease, including four cases of hyperplasia and two patients with a double adenoma. Eighty-three patients (75%) were discharged the day of surgery. The use of preoperative localization and intraoperative PTH monitoring permits a targeted approach to the treatment of primary hyperparathyroidism. Endocrine surgeons should be facile in all minimally invasive parathyroid techniques to individualize the operative approach.

### Sestamibi scans and intraoperative parathyroid hormone measurement in the treatment of primary hyperparathyroidism… [^1145cqyt]. JAMA Network (2004). Excellent credibility.

Main Outcome Measures Rate of postoperative persistent hyperparathyroidism. Results A total of 376 patients met the requirements for inclusion in the study. There were 275 women and 101 men. Of the patients, 325 had single adenomas, 28 had double adenomas, 16 had 3 or more abnormal glands, and 1 had parathyroid cancer. There were 9 cases of persistent or recurrent hypercalcemia after surgery. Duration of follow-up ranged from 1 to 37 months. The sensitivity of sestamibi scanning for detecting MGD was 23%, and the positive predictive value was 63%. Using the requirement that the IOPTH level fall by 50% from the first baseline and into the normal range, MGD was distinguished from solitary adenoma in 36 of 41 cases. Conclusions The combination of preoperative sestamibi scanning and IOPTH measurement is effective in identifying cases of MGD and allows successful minimally invasive parathyroidectomy in most patients.

Parathyroid scanning with technetium Tc 99m sestamibi was introduced in 1989 and has become the standard preoperative imaging modality for patients with PHPTH. 10–12 The sensitivity of sestamibi scanning is reported to be 87% for the detection of single adenomas but only 55. The remaining 376 patients make up the subjects of this study. Each operation was performed by 1 of 3 attending surgeons. The following data were collected: age at time of surgery, sex, preoperative and postoperative calcium and PTH levels, sestamibi scan results, IOPTH data, type of operation, surgical findings, and histopathologic results. Preoperative sestamibi scanning was performed at the Long Island Jewish Medical Center on 375 of the 376 patients. The following protocol was used for sestamibi imaging: patients were injected with 25 to 30 mCi of technetium Tc 99m sestamibi. The operations performed are grouped into 3 categories.

Minimally invasive parathyroidectomy is performed through a small incision over the single abnormal gland that is exposed and excised. No attempt is made to identify additional glands. In unilateral explorations, both glands on the explored side are identified. Bilateral exploration is the traditional bilateral cervical parathyroid exploration, attempting to identify all 4 glands. Specimens were judged by the pathologists to be abnormal based on gross and histological criteria including weight, cellularity, fat depletion, and morphology. There were 275 women and 101 men, ranging in age from 15 to 89 years. Of these patients, 325 had single adenomas, 28 had double adenomas, 16 had 3 or more abnormal glands, and 1 had parathyroid cancer. There were 6 cases in which no abnormal parathyroid tissue was identified.

Primary hyperparathyroidism has traditionally been treated with bilateral cervical exploration and removal of all grossly enlarged glands. This operation has a success rate of 95% to 98% and a low incidence of associated morbidity. 1–5 In approximately 85% to 92% of cases, PHPTH is caused by a single adenoma. 1, 2, 16, 17 Therefore, many surgeons have advocated more limited surgical approaches. In 1993, Worsey et al18 described 371 patients with PHPTH treated surgically, without preoperative imaging or IOPTH measurement. They arbitrarily began their operations on the right side and terminated the procedure if a single adenoma and another normal gland was found. Unilateral exploration was possible in 125 of 371 patients, and they reported only 1 case of persistent disease in this group. However, it was not until the advent of accurate preoperative localization and IOPTH measurement that more limited approaches to parathyroid surgery became more widely accepted. 6–9.

### Intraoperative parathyroid hormone monitoring in patients with recognized multiglandular primary hyperparathyroidism [^114GhV3g]. World Journal of Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Intraoperative parathyroid hormone (IOPTH) monitoring reliably predicts cure of primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) due to single-gland disease. However, its utility in PHPT caused by multiple-gland disease (MGD) is still debated, for both detection and prediction of adequate resection. Our hypothesis is that once MGD is encountered during an operation, more stringent criteria for determining adequate resection can improve cure rates.

Methods

This was a retrospective cohort study of patients with PHPT who were found to have MGD during the course of focused parathyroidectomy. IOPTH levels after completed multiple parathyroid gland excision were compared between cured patients and those with persistent hyperparathyroidism.

Results

Of 1855 patients undergoing focused parathyroidectomy, 243 were found to have MGD. Of the 207 study patients with MGD, 193 were cured and 14 had persistent hyperparathyroidism. After final gland excision, the mean ± SEM percentage decrease in IOPTH from the baseline was of significantly greater magnitude for the cured group (90.0 ± 0.5%) than for the persistent group (74.0 ± 3.8%) (p < 0.01). The mean ± SEM IOPTH after completed multigland excision was higher in the persistent group (44.0 ± 8.4 pg/ml) than in the cured group (34.0 ± 3.5 pg/ml) (p = 0.19), although both were within the normal range (12–65 pg/ml). When the groups were analyzed for an incremental fall of IOPTH from the baseline, the criteria of ≥ 75% drop and into the normal range improved the positive predictive value from 93.2 to 96.6% when compared to the standard criterion of a 50% decrease from the baseline.

Conclusions

When PHPT due to MGD is recognized and focused parathyroidectomy is extended, a final postexcision PTH level that is ≥ 75% decreased from the baseline PTH level and in the normal range should be used to predict adequate gland resection.

### Diagnosis and management of primary hyperparathyroidism across the VA health care system… [^112YTGzA]. JAMA Network (2019). Excellent credibility.

© 2025 Question How is primary hyperparathyroidism diagnosed and treated in a large integrated health system using electronic health records. Findings In this national cohort study of 371 370 veterans with chronic hypercalcemia, 86 887 were evaluated for primary hyperparathyroidism with serum parathyroid hormone level. Of 47 158 patients with hormonal evidence of primary hyperparathyroidism, 6049 underwent definitive treatment with parathyroidectomy. Meaning Primary hyperparathyroidism appears to be underdiagnosed despite the presence of chronic hypercalcemia, and it is undertreated with parathyroidectomy despite surgical indications. Importance Untreated primary hyperparathyroidism impairs quality of life and incurs substantial costs. Parathyroidectomy is a low-risk, high-success, definitive intervention.

Objectives To determine the appropriateness of diagnostic evaluation for primary hyperparathyroidism in patients with hypercalcemia and the use of parathyroidectomy for the treatment of primary hyperparathyroidism across the Veterans Affairs health care system. Design, Setting, and Participants. Main Outcomes and Measures The proportion of veterans with hypercalcemia who have parathyroid hormone levels evaluated, the proportion of veterans with hyperparathyroidism who are treated surgically, and the factors associated with parathyroidectomy using generalized linear latent and mixed model regression. Results. Of 371 370 patients with chronic hypercalcemia, 86 887 received further testing with parathyroid hormone level. Of 47 158 patients meeting diagnostic criteria for primary hyperparathyroidism, 6048 underwent parathyroidectomy.

Of 5793 patients with primary hyperparathyroidism presenting with a serum calcium level more than 1 mg/dL above the upper limit of normal, 1501 underwent parathyroidectomy. There was a decreasing trend in the use of parathyroidectomy over time. Conclusions and Relevance From this study's findings, parathyroid hormone level is infrequently tested in patients with hypercalcemia, suggesting underdiagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism. Patients meeting diagnostic criteria for primary hyperparathyroidism are undertreated with recommended parathyroidectomy. Similar gaps have previously been observed in non-VA care of primary hyperparathyroidism, suggesting the need for a systematic evaluation of barriers to diagnosis and treatment that informs intervention design. Parathyroidectomy is the only definitive treatment for pHPT. It is a low-risk operation, commonly performed on an outpatient basis, with high cure rates and excellent long-term outcomes, including in elderly patients.

5–7 Surgical intervention for pHPT has been associated with increased bone mineral density, decreased risk of fracture, decreased progression of kidney disease, and decreased rates of associated cardiovascular. Thus, we examined diagnostic evaluation for pHPT and treatment patterns in the VA health care system. Our study objectives were to assess the rate of diagnostic testing for pHPT among patients with hypercalcemia, examine the use of parathyroidectomy for pHPT and determine temporal trends, and identify factors associated with surgical treatment in pHPT. We created a cohort of eligible patients by applying inclusion and exclusion criteria.

### Revised American Thyroid Association guidelines for the management of medullary thyroid carcinoma [^111Ci6pH]. Pediatrics (2018). Medium credibility.

Management of HPTH in MEN2A after thyroidectomy — localization and reoperation strategy states that in this setting preoperative localization (with sestamibi scanning, US, or CT) should precede repeat neck exploration, and enlarged parathyroid glands found at reoperation with recurrent or persistent HPTH should be resected with PTH monitoring to document that parathyroid function has been preserved or re-established. If only one enlarged parathyroid is found the remaining three glands should be reviewed and parathyroid of normal size should be left in situ; if only one normal size parathyroid gland is identified and there is histological documentation that three parathyroid glands have been removed previously, a portion of the enlarged gland should either be left in situ with an adequate blood supply or grafted to a heterotopic site. Grade C Recommendation. If the patient remains hyperparathyroid despite one or more operations, or the patient is not a candidate for parathyroidectomy, medical therapy with calcimimetics should be considered.

### Impact of intraoperative intact PTH monitoring on reoperation rates and surgical success in primary hyperparathyroidism [^1132BaQh]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is caused by excessive parathormone secretion from one or more parathyroid glands. The primary treatment for PHPT is surgery. Due to anatomical variations in the parathyroid glands, preoperative localization, surgical approaches, and success rates can vary. With the development of advanced imaging techniques and the introduction of intraoperative intact PTH (i-PTH) measurement, traditional extended surgical approaches have increasingly been replaced by focused surgeries.

Objective

Intraoperative i-PTH measurement has been applied by different surgeons using various criteria. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of intraoperative i-PTH measurement in improving surgical success, particularly in cases with inconclusive preoperative imaging results.

Methods

Between January 2010 and September 2020, 203 adult patients who underwent surgery for PHPT in our clinic were included in the study. Patients were categorized into two groups: Group A (with intraoperative i-PTH measurement) and Group B (without i-PTH measurement). Persistent hyperparathyroidism was defined as elevated calcium levels occurring shortly after surgery, whereas recurrence was defined as calcium elevation after the 6th postoperative month. The absence of recurrence or persistent hypercalcemia was considered an indicator of surgical success.

Results

The mean age of the patients was 54.6 ± 12.7 years. Of the 203 patients, 40 (19.7%) were male and 163 (80.3%) were female. No correlation was found between recurrence or persistence and patient age. The overall success rate was 93.6%. Surgical success was achieved in 97.8% of patients in Group A and 90% in Group B, indicating a statistically significant difference between the groups (p = 0.023).

Conclusion

Intraoperative i-PTH measurement significantly increases the success rate of PHPT surgery, reducing the incidence of recurrent or persistent cases and the need for secondary operations. Consequently, it helps prevent complications associated with reoperations. These findings highlight the pivotal role of intraoperative i-PTH monitoring in optimizing surgical outcomes, especially in complex PHPT cases.

### Intraoperative parathyroid hormone monitoring in parathyroidectomy: predicting cure and recurrence in tertiary hyperparathyroidism-systematic review [^113KKLJP]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

The aim of this systematic review was to investigate the value of intraoperative parathyroid hormone (IOPTH) monitoring in parathyroidectomy for tertiary hyperparathyroidism (THPT) to predict cure and recurrence.

Data Sources

Ovid, Embase, EBSCO Host, Citation Checking.

Methods

This study was performed in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. A systematic search of the literature was conducted to identify studies evaluating IOPTH monitoring in patients with THPT. Only studies addressing THPT with documented use of IOPTH in their surgery were included.

Results

In 11 of the 18 studies included in this review IOPTH monitoring influenced the surgery by identifying insufficient resection or ectopic/supernumerary glands necessitating further resection to cure patients. Rates of recurrence were absent or minimal in patients who achieved appropriate IOPTH drops at specified time intervals.

Conclusion

IOPTH monitoring is a useful adjunct to prevent insufficient resection of hyperplastic glands and to identify ectopic/supernumerary glands. Median PTH drop at specified time intervals can help predict cure and recurrence in parathyroidectomy for THPT.

### Predicting tumor volume in primary hyperparathyroidism from preoperative clinical data [^113sgswb]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is a surgical endocrine disorder. Guidelines for surgical intervention and management guidelines have been established in many countries, and parathyroidectomy is considered the only definitive treatment. Since PHPT is most often (80–85%) due to a single adenoma, targeted selective or focused approaches gained support when Russell and Tibblin pioneered these surgeries in the early 1980s. In the 1990s, Irvin devised a method of rapid intraoperative PTH monitoring, allowing functional decisions to be made according to the so-called Miami criteria, and the focused approach became widespread in addition to the traditional bilateral searching approach. On the other hand, bilateral exploration is recommended for patients with unknown localization or known or suspected multigland disease. If the location of the lesion responsible for primary hyperparathyroidism is identified preoperatively, the focused approach can achieve disease cure in ≥ 95% of cases, a rate almost as high as the traditional bilateral searching approach. Patients with at least 1 preoperative localizing study can undergo the focused approach and anticipate a cure rate of 99%. Models have also been developed that distinguish between a single-gland and multigland parathyroid disease in PHPT. Preoperative diagnostic imaging techniques such as ultrasonography, computed tomography, and 99m Tc-methoxy-isobutyl-isonitrile (MIBI) scintigraphy are used to localize the gland, but preoperative localization may be incorrect or surgical treatment may prove unsuccessful. Preoperative prediction of the size and localization of the responsible lesion would be very useful to the surgeon, helping to determine the extent of the search and the approach to be adopted.

### Elevated parathyroid hormone levels after parathyroidectomy for primary hyperparathyroidism [^1123e2Ry]. Head & Neck (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Curative parathyroidectomy is associated with elevated levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH) with eucalcemia. This study sought to determine the frequency, clinical significance, and risk factors of this finding.

Methods

Seventy-six consecutive patients surgically treated for primary hyperparathyroidism due to a single parathyroid adenoma in 2006 to 2007 were monitored for 1 month postoperatively; those with elevated PTH levels (> 70 pg/mL) were monitored for 18 months.

Results

Nineteen patients (25%) had high postoperative PTH levels with normal calcium levels. Compared with the remaining patients, this group had a significantly higher average preoperative PTH level (224.89 vs 156.86 pg/mL) and a lesser intraoperative decrease in PTH.

Conclusions

About 25% of eucalcemic patients may have elevated PTH levels after parathyroidectomy. A high preoperative PTH level (> 225 pg/mL) may predict a persistently high postoperative level. Evaluation of blood and urine calcium, bone density, and cardiac function should be considered in affected patients.

### Impact of intraoperative parathyroid hormone monitoring on the prediction of multiglandular parathyroid disease [^1144iX95]. World Journal of Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

Optimal interpretation of the results of intraoperative parathyroid hormone (IOPTH) monitoring during neck exploration for primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT) is still controversial. The reliability of the "50% rule" in multiglandular disease (MGD) is often disputed, mostly because of competing pathophysiologic paradigms. The aim of this study was to ascertain and corroborate the ability of IOPTH monitoring to detect MGD in a practice, combining conventional and alternative parathyroidectomy techniques. This is a retrospective single institution analysis of 69 consecutive patients undergoing cervical exploration for pHPT by various approaches. The IOPTH measurements were performed after induction of anesthesia but prior to skin incision and 10 minutes after excision of the first visualized enlarged parathyroid gland. In this series, 55 patients (80%) had single adenomas, and 14 patients (20%) had MGD. In 8 of the 14 patients with MGD, IOPTH levels were obtained sequentially after removal of every enlarged gland. Of these 8 patients, 6 (75%) had a false-positive decrease (decrease below 50% of baseline value in presence of another enlarged gland) failing to predict the presence of a second enlarged gland. In 2 cases IOPTH monitoring provided a true-negative result, correctly predicting MGD. If MGD is defined by gross morphologic criteria, IOPTH monitoring fails to predict the presence of MGD reliably. However, if MGD is defined by functional criteria, the course of these patients does not seem significantly affected. The importance of these findings must be further investigated, especially with regard to the outcome of minimally invasive parathyroid procedures.

### Extreme elevation of baseline intraoperative parathyroid hormone measurements: should usual protocols apply? [^112Cx1eP]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Intraoperative parathyroid hormone (IOPTH) monitoring is routinely used to facilitate minimally invasive parathyroidectomy. Many IOPTH protocols exist for predicting biochemical cure. Some patients are found to have extremely high baseline IOPTH levels (defined in this study as > 500 pg/mL), which may affect the likelihood of satisfying certain final IOPTH criteria. We aimed to discover whether clinically significant differences exist in patients with extremely high baseline IOPTH and which IOPTH protocols are most appropriately applied to these patients.

Materials and Methods

This is a retrospective review of 237 patients who underwent parathyroidectomy with IOPTH monitoring for primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT) from 2016 to 2020. Baseline IOPTH levels, drawn prior to manipulation of parathyroid glands, were grouped into categories labeled "elevated" (> 65–500 pg/mL) and "extremely elevated" (> 500 pg/mL). Final IOPTH levels were analyzed to determine whether there was a > 50% decrease from baseline and whether a normal IOPTH value was achieved. 6-wk postoperative calcium levels were also examined.

Results

Of the patients in this cohort, 76% were in the elevated group and 24% in the extremely elevated group. Male sex and higher preoperative PTH levels were correlated with higher baseline IOPTH levels. Patients with extremely elevated baseline IOPTH were less likely to have IOPTH fall into normal range at the conclusion of the case (P = 0.019), and final IOPTH levels were higher (P < 0.001), but the IOPTH was equally likely to decrease > 50% from baseline. There was no difference in the mean postoperative calcium levels between the two groups at 6-wk or at longer term follow-up (mean 525 d).

Conclusions

Detection of baseline IOPTH levels > 500 pg/mL during parathyroidectomy performed for pHPT is not uncommon. IOPTH in patients with extremely elevated baseline levels were less likely to fall into normal range, but follow-up calcium levels were equal, suggesting that applying more stringent IOPTH criteria for predicting biochemical cure may not be appropriate for this population.

### Investigating the effectiveness of intraoperative rapid parathyroid hormone assay in parathyroidectomy surgery in patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism [^111qa9uK]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Io-PTH measurement's effectiveness in managing the parathyroid gland in the context of primary hyperparathyroidism, both adenoma and hyperplasia, have been reported. Direct unilateral neck exploration based on preoperative evaluation and localization, along with Io-PTH assessment, can be beneficial in decreasing surgery time, costs, and morbidity. However, bilateral routine exploration in Multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) syndromes and SHPT are still a matter of debate. The application of Io-PTH monitoring with a diagnostic accuracy of 93–98% based on other studies is a good predictor of complete resection and success in abnormal parathyroid resection. Therefore, our study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of rapid Io-PTH in the surgical management of SHPT patients.

Since total or subtotal parathyroidectomy is required for successful treatment, a 50% reduction in PTH is likely insufficient to estimate the appropriate treatment response in SHPT. Using rapid Io-PTH measurement and evaluation, the mean PTH reduction in this study was 74.7% at 10 min and 85% at 20 min. Patients had low PTH levels and significant recovery during the follow-up period. Only two patients showed PTH reduction of less than 60% after 10 min and less than 80% at 20 min after removal of the four glands and upper part of thymus, in which we had detected an extra parathyroid (ectopic) gland in the paraesophageal area. However, their PTH levels converted to normal during follow-ups due to ectopic parathyroid removal during re-exploration.

### Focused parathyroid surgery with intraoperative parathyroid hormone measurement as a day-case procedure [^117LgAcj]. The British Journal of Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

Background

This study assessed the feasibility, efficacy and safety of focused parathyroidectomy combined with intraoperative parathyroid hormone (IOPTH) measurement in a day-case setting.

Methods

Over 28 months 50 consecutive patients (mean age 63 (range 33–92) years) with clear evidence of unifocal disease on sestamibi scanning or ultrasonography underwent unilateral neck exploration via a small lateral incision. Blood samples for measurement of IOPTH were taken at induction of anaesthesia, before adenoma excision and after adenoma excision (at 5, 10 and 20 min). Ten patients were discharged within 23 h and 40 patients on the day of surgery.

Results

A solitary adenoma was identified in all but one patient, with a mean operating time of 30 (range 16–57) min. After parathyroidectomy, IOPTH levels fell appropriately except in one patient with multiglandular hyperplasia. No patient developed symptomatic hypocalcaemia during the 2 weeks after operation, enabling cessation of oral supplements. All patients remained normocalcaemic on follow-up (mean 26 (range 8–84) weeks) and histological examination confirmed parathyroid adenoma (48 patients), hyperplasia (one) or carcinoma (one).

Conclusion

After accurate preoperative localization of uniglandular disease, patients with primary hyperparathyroidism may be managed successfully and safely by focused parathyroidectomy with IOPTH measurement as a day-case procedure.

### The value of intraoperative parathyroid hormone monitoring in localized primary hyperparathyroidism: a cost analysis [^115VZe8M]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2010). Low credibility.

Decision Model

Decision analysis software (TreeAge Pro 2008; TreeAge Software, Williamstown, MA) was used to construct a decision model for the treatment of the reference case. The complete decision tree is shown in Fig. 1. Different treatment pathways were created for the two alternatives: first, MIP without the use of IOPTH, and second, MIP with the use of IOPTH. The selected probabilities are shown in Table 1. The hypothetical patient was assumed to be a surgical candidate with no history of neck surgery and that parathyroidectomy could be safely performed through a cervical incision (i.e. no sternotomy, thoracotomy, or thoracoscopy required for ectopic glands). The cure rate for initial parathyroidectomy without IOPTH was assigned a probability of 96.3%. Relevant long-term complications of surgery included permanent recurrent laryngeal nerve damage and hypoparathyroidism. The risk of long-term complications resulting from initial parathyroid surgery was set at 1–2%. The risks of temporary recurrent laryngeal nerve damage or hypoparathyroidism were not factored into the model. Failed initial parathyroidectomy led to one reoperation. Costs related to medical management were not considered given our assumption of an asymptomatic patient.

IOPTH intraoperative parathyroid hormone, PHPT primary hyperparathyroidism

As shown in Fig. 1, we analyzed decision pathways where IOPTH is or is not used. We used the operating characteristics of IOPTH to determine the added value of IOPTH monitoring in patients with adequate preoperative localization of parathyroid adenomas. Studies analyzed generally used the Miami criterion to predict cure versus the need for continued exploration (IOPTH decrease ≥ 50% from the highest of either preincision or preexcision level at 10 min after gland excision). The costs and probabilities were based on distributions of values determined from reviewing the literature (Table 1).

### The value of intraoperative parathyroid hormone monitoring in localized primary hyperparathyroidism: a cost analysis [^116KCPUD]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2010). Low credibility.

Fig. 4
One-way sensitivity analysis of probability of cure without intraoperative parathyroid hormone (IOPTH) monitoring. IOPTH monitoring becomes cost saving when the probability of cure without IOPTH monitoring decreases below 94%. In the model, this probability relates inversely with the prevalence of undetected multiple gland disease among patients with positive localization studies

Fig. 5
Two-way sensitivity analysis of cost of intraoperative parathyroid hormone (IOPTH) and probability of cure without IOPTH monitoring. The reference case values, derived from Medicare diagnosis-related groups and literature review, are shown. When all other assumptions in the model are held constant, this analysis permits cost assessment of IOPTH monitoring among institutions with different published rates of undetected multiple gland disease (MGD). When the MGD rate is 22% (Cleveland (16)), IOPTH monitoring is always cost saving, irrespective of test-related costs. When the MGD rate is 10% (Madison (8)), IOPTH monitoring becomes cost saving as test-related costs fall below $440. When the MGD rate is 2% (Sydney (5)), IOPTH monitoring is never cost saving

Fig. 6
Two-way sensitivity analysis of cost of reoperation and probability of cure without intraoperative parathyroid hormone (IOPTH) monitoring. The y -axis is inclusive of an approximately ninefold error in reoperation cost. The reference case values are shown

We also performed sensitivity analysis on the performance characteristics of IOPTH monitoring. In our model, the rates of false-positive and false-negative IOPTH results are represented by the probability that IOPTH decreases when a single localized gland is removed. Raising the probability that IOPTH decreases to 100% simultaneously optimizes the positive predictive value of IOPTH and eliminates false-negative results that would prompt unnecessary continued exploration. In two-way sensitivity analysis, the use of an ideally performing IOPTH test is cost saving when the probability of cure without IOPTH monitoring decreases below 94% (Fig. 7). Less-than-perfect IOPTH test performance requires a lower probability of cure without IOPTH monitoring in order for IOPTH to become cost saving.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism: part two: surgical management [^1164bP4G]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is caused by the overproduction of parathyroid hormone by 1 or more parathyroid glands resulting in hypercalcemia and its downstream clinical consequences. The definitive management of PHPT is surgery. Approaches to successful surgery include bilateral exploration or focused parathyroidectomy with intraoperative parathyroid hormone monitoring, which in experienced hands are both associated with a low risk of complications.

### Contemporary management of primary hyperparathyroidism [^115Gbaya]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Primary hyperparathyroidism can be asymptomatic or symptomatic, as well as classic, normocalcemic, or normohormonal. It is important to rule out other causes of hypercalcemia or hyperparathyroidism. Preoperative localization with imaging is necessary for a minimally invasive approach and can be helpful even if planning 4-gland exploration. There are a variety of intraoperative techniques that can assist with localization as well as confirming success. Standard of care remains surgical resection of affected glands. However, there are less invasive management strategies that can be considered for poor surgical candidates.

### American Thyroid Association statement on postoperative hypoparathyroidism: diagnosis, prevention, and management in adults [^112bQPV3]. Thyroid (2018). Medium credibility.

Biochemical testing — perioperative calcium monitoring after total thyroidectomy — In one study, serum calcium levels were measured at 6 and 12 hours, and a positive serum calcium slope (rise in level) identified patients safe for discharge with or without calcium supplementation; for those with a non-positive slope but serum calcium levels ≥ 8 mg/dL, discharge with calcium supplementation was also found to be safe. Because trending calcium often requires sampling over a 12- to 24-hour or longer time period and may be confounded by prophylactic calcium and calcitriol administration or low preoperative vitamin D levels, many groups have examined the utility of intraoperative or postoperative intact PTH levels.

### Validity and limits of intraoperative parathyroid hormone monitoring during minimally invasive parathyroidectomy: a 10-year experience [^1168j5QC]. Surgical Endoscopy (2010). Low credibility.

Background

The availability of intraoperative intact parathyroid hormone monitoring allows the success of minimally invasive parathyroidectomy to be ensured during the operation. However, false-negative results leading to unnecessary explorations and difficulties in interpreting the data raise concern about the effectiveness of the method.

Methods

Patients with primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT) and one unequivocally enlarged parathyroid gland on preoperative ultrasound or (99m)Tc-SestaMIBI scintigraphy underwent minimally invasive video-assisted parathyroidectomy according to the technique initially described by Miccoli. Intraoperatively, rapid electrochemiluminescence immunoassay was used to measure intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) levels before the operation, after complete mobilization of the adenoma (preexcision value), and 5, 10, and 15 min after the excision. The operation was considered successful when more than a 50% decrease in preexcision iPTH levels and subsequent attainment of the normal range within 15 min were observed.

Results

Between November 1999 and November 2009, 235 (43%) of 546 patients with pHPT were eligible for a minimally invasive approach. Intraoperative iPTH monitoring showed 221 true-positive, 1 false-positive, 6 false-negative, and 7 true-negative results. This calculated to a sensitivity of 97% and a specificity of 88%.

Conclusions

Despite the availability of high-resolution ultrasound and (99m)Tc-SestaMIBI scintigraphy, the presence of multiple glandular disease cannot be ruled out completely. Although the authors observed six false-negative results, they believe that intraoperative iPTH monitoring represents a valuable asset for minimally invasive parathyroidectomy because it identifies sporadic hyperplasia.

### The landmark series: management of primary hyperparathyroidism [^115o2tun]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

Surgery is the only definitive treatment for primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT). The surgical management of PHPT has evolved over the past several decades in response to the continually growing body of evidence supporting its effectiveness in both symptomatic and asymptomatic disease. As imaging modalities for localization, operative approach, and intraoperative adjuncts, such as intraoperative parathyroid hormone testing, have been optimized, careful evaluation of the timing of parathyroidectomy in relationship to the disease's natural history has been pursued to limit the detrimental end-organ effects of untreated PHPT. Herein, we review select studies examining key aspects of PHPT management fundamental to the practicing surgical oncologist and endocrine surgeon caring for patients with PHPT.

### Using ex vivo radioactivity measurement to differentiate parathyroid single-gland and multigland disease [^117CrGZt]. The Oncologist (2025). Medium credibility.

Implications for Practice

The findings of this study suggest that intraoperative radioactivity measurement can be a valuable tool for parathyroid surgeons in distinguishing between single-gland disease (SGD) and multigland disease. The threshold of a radioactivity ratio ≥ 1.2 demonstrated a high positive predictive value (85.3%) for SGD, offering a reliable and time-efficient method to guide surgical decisions. Integrating this technique with intraoperative parathyroid hormone monitoring may reduce the need for more invasive or prolonged procedures, potentially improving patient outcomes. Surgeons could use this simple and rapid intraoperative tool to help determine whether a bilateral neck exploration is necessary, ultimately optimizing surgical planning and minimizing unnecessary wait times in the operating room.

### Intraoperative parathyroid hormone monitoring to determine long-term success of total parathyroidectomy for secondary hyperparathyroidism [^116DPvkq]. Head & Neck (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Use of intraoperative parathyroid hormone (ioPTH) monitoring during total parathyroidectomy for secondary hyperparathyroidism is common, although its ability to predict long-term normoparathyroid state is not known.

Methods

Prospective evaluation of 57 consecutive patients undergoing total parathyroidectomy for renal hyperparathyroidism with ioPTH monitoring and follow-up PTH assays were used to categorize the patients into 3 groups: success, adequate biochemical control, and failure.

Results

There was no statistically significant difference in percentage reduction of ioPTH between the 3 groups (p = .07), although there was a moderate negative correlation between percentage reduction of ioPTH and percentage reduction of PTH at follow-up (R = 0.57).

Conclusions

When used under current guidelines, ioPTH monitoring is of no use in predicting long-term cure for these patients because it does not predict success. Patients that undergo total parathyroidectomy are required to have long-term calcium and PTH assay follow-up because normoparathyroidism cannot be assumed. Using the regression equation calculated, success may be predicted for future patients.

The classic surgical approach to patients undergoing parathyroidectomy for primary or secondary hyperparathyroidism has experienced a dramatic shift owing to preoperative localization of the affected glands and/or the use of rapid intraoperative parathyroid hormone (RI-PTH) assays, allowing for minimally invasive surgical excisions. Institutional experience with 141 patients who underwent parathyroidectomy aided by the use of RI-PTH is reviewed. The orientation provided by the intraoperative assay is essential in guiding the surgeon in these minimally invasive procedures, it helps reveal the cases of primary hyperparathyroidism with involvement of more than 1 gland, and it replaces the need for performing frozen sections, except for cases of secondary hyperparathyroidism.

### The value of intraoperative parathyroid hormone monitoring in localized primary hyperparathyroidism: a cost analysis [^112jmPMn]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2010). Low credibility.

Results

In our model, the base case assumption was that IOPTH improves the operative success rate from 96.3 to 98.8%. At baseline conditions, the IOPTH strategy increased the treatment cost by 3.8%. IOPTH was cost saving when assay-related costs were less than $110 per case (Fig. 2), or when the cost of reoperation exceeded $12,000 (Fig. 3).

Fig. 2
One-way sensitivity analysis of cost of intraoperative parathyroid hormone (IOPTH). IOPTH monitoring becomes cost saving when test-related costs fall below $110. This value considers both the cost of the test and the cost of operating room time spent waiting for results

Fig. 3
One-way sensitivity analysis of reoperation cost. Intraoperative parathyroid hormone (IOPTH) monitoring becomes cost-saving when the reoperation cost increases above $12,000. The difference in the slopes of the two lines reflects the marginal improvement in success rate of initial surgery associated with IOPTH monitoring in the model

The probability of failure to cure PHPT by single-gland parathyroidectomy without IOPTH monitoring is a surrogate for the rate of unrecognized MGD in patients with well-localized disease. If the probability of cure without IOPTH monitoring is > 94%, under base case IOPTH and reoperation costs, the use of IOPTH will increase treatment costs (Fig. 4). If the probability of cure without IOPTH monitoring is < 94%, the use of IOPTH will reduce treatment costs. Two-way sensitivity analyses also yielded threshold values for cost savings of IOPTH on the basis of test-related costs and cost of reoperation, according to the probability of cure without IOPTH monitoring (Figs. 5, 6). As the probability of cure without IOPTH decreases to < 90%, IOPTH monitoring becomes the dominant strategy in both analyses. Conversely, as the probability of cure without IOPTH exceeds 98%, it is never cost saving to use IOPTH monitoring, even when test-related costs are as low as $25 and the cost of reoperation is $50,000.

### Minimally invasive parathyroidectomy guided by intraoperative parathyroid hormone monitoring (IOPTH) and preoperative imaging versus bilateral neck exploration for primary hyperparathyroidism in adults [^116mJo5d]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Bilateral neck exploration (BNE) is the traditional approach to sporadic primary hyperparathyroidism. With the availability of the preoperative imaging techniques and intraoperative parathyroid hormone assays, minimally invasive parathyroidectomy (MIP) is fast becoming the favoured surgical approach.

Objectives

To assess the effects of minimally invasive parathyroidectomy (MIP) guided by preoperative imaging and intraoperative parathyroid hormone monitoring versus bilateral neck exploration (BNE) for the surgical management of primary hyperparathyroidism.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, WHO ICTRP and ClinicalTrials.gov. The date of the last search of all databases was 21 October 2019. There were no language restrictions applied.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials comparing MIP to BNE for the treatment of sporadic primary hyperparathyroidism in persons undergoing surgery for the first time.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened titles and abstracts for relevance. Two review authors independently screened for inclusion, extracted data and carried out risk of bias assessment. The content expert senior author resolved conflicts. We assessed studies for overall certainty of the evidence using the GRADE instrument. We conducted meta-analyses using a random-effects model and performed statistical analyses according to the guidelines in the latest version of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions.

Main Results

We identified five eligible studies, all conducted in European university hospitals. They included 266 adults, 136 participants were randomised to MIP and 130 participants to BNE. Data were available for all participants post-surgery up to one year, with the exception of missing data for two participants in the MIP group and for one participant in the BNE group at one year. Nine participants in the MIP group and 11 participants in the BNE group had missing data at five years. No study had a low risk of bias in all risk of bias domains. The risk ratio (RR) for success rate (eucalcaemia) at six months in the MIP group compared to the BNE group was 0.98 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.94 to 1.03; P = 0.43; 5 studies, 266 participants; very low-certainty evidence). A total of 132/136 (97.1%) participants in the MIP group compared with 129/130 (99.2%) participants in the BNE group were judged as operative success. At five years, the RR was 0.94 (95% CI 0.83 to 1.08; P = 0.38; 1 study, 77 participants; very low-certainty evidence). A total of 34/38 (89.5%) participants in the MIP group compared with 37/39 (94.9%) participants in the BNE group were judged as operative success. The RR for the total incidence of perioperative adverse events was 0.50, in favour of MIP (95% CI 0.33 to 0.76; P = 0.001; 5 studies, 236 participants; low-certainty evidence). Perioperative adverse events occurred in 23/136 (16.9%) participants in the MIP group compared with 44/130 (33.9%) participants in the BNE group. The 95% prediction interval ranged between 0.25 and 0.99. These adverse events included symptomatic hypocalcaemia, vocal cord palsy, bleeding, fever and infection. Fifteen of 104 (14.4%) participants experienced symptomatic hypocalcaemia in the MIP group compared with 26/98 (26.5%) participants in the BNE group. The RR for this event comparing MIP with BNE at two days was 0.54 (95% CI 0.32 to 0.92; P = 0.02; 4 studies, 202 participants). Statistical significance was lost in sensitivity analyses, with a 95% prediction interval ranging between 0.17 and 1.74. Five out of 133 (3.8%) participants in the MIP group experienced vocal cord paralysis compared with 2/128 (1.6%) participants in the BNE group. The RR for this event was 1.87 (95% CI 0.47 to 7.51; P = 0.38; 5 studies, 261 participants). The 95% prediction interval ranged between 0.20 and 17.87. The effect on all-cause mortality was not explicitly reported and could not be adequately assessed (very low-certainty evidence). There was no clear difference for health-related quality of life between the treatment groups in two studies, but studies did not report numerical data (very low-certainty evidence). There was a possible treatment benefit for MIP compared to BNE in terms of cosmetic satisfaction (very low-certainty evidence). The mean difference (MD) for duration of surgery comparing BNE with MIP was in favour of the MIP group (-18 minutes, 95% CI -31 to -6; P = 0.004; 3 studies, 171 participants; very low-certainty evidence). The 95% prediction interval ranged between -162 minutes and 126 minutes. The studies did not report length of hospital stay. Four studies reported intraoperative conversion rate from MIP to open procedure information. Out of 115 included participants, there were 24 incidences of conversion, amounting to a conversion rate of 20.8%.

Authors' Conclusions

The success rates of MIP and BNE at six months were comparable. There were similar results at five years, but these were only based on one study. The incidence of perioperative symptomatic hypocalcaemia was lower in the MIP compared to the BNE group, whereas the incidence of vocal cord paralysis tended to be higher. Our systematic review did not provide clear evidence for the superiority of MIP over BNE. However, it was limited by low-certainty to very low-certainty evidence.

### Parathyroid surgery: separating promise from reality [^116bxqNk]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2002). Low credibility.

We set out to determine the accuracy in predicting the success of biochemical and localizing studies for use in a minimally invasive parathyroidectomy. Preoperative sestamibi scans, intraoperative gamma-probe examinations, and intraoperative PTH (IOPTH) monitoring were performed on a prospective cohort of patients. Seventy-one patients were included in the study. Of the 59 patients (83%) with primary HPT, adenoma localization by sestamibi scanning was correct in 95% with solitary adenomas, but was correct in only 25% of the 14 patients with multiple adenomas. In patients with secondary and tertiary disease, sestamibi scanning incorrectly identified a single hot spot in 64% of cases. In no case of hyperplasia was the probe useful in locating other glands after a single gland was removed. IOPTH was accurate in 78% of patients with primary disease and in only 45% of patients with nonprimary disease. A minimal approach can be considered in a select group of patients that does not have familial primary HPT, secondary or tertiary disease, coexisting thyroid pathology, or an equivocal sestamibi scan. Only patients with a positive single hot spot on sestamibi scan can be considered candidates. Using this criteria only 64% of all patients with hyperparathyroidism are candidates for a minimally invasive approach. The combination of a solitary hot spot on sestamibi scan and a fall in IOPTH allows the surgeon to make the correct decision regarding the need to convert to a bilateral approach in 93% of these selected patients.

### The surgical management of asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism: proceedings of the fourth international workshop [^115adJ2W]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

The surgical management of primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) has undergone considerable advances over the past two decades. The purpose of this report is to review these advances.

Participants

This subgroup was constituted by the Steering Committee of the Fourth International Workshop on the Management of Asymptomatic Primary Hyperparathyroidism to address key questions related to the surgical management of PHPT.

Evidence

Data since the last International Workshop were presented and discussed in detail. The topics included improvements in preoperative imaging, intraoperative adjuncts, refinements in local and regional anesthesia, and rapid intraoperative PTH assays.

Consensus Process

Questions were developed by the International Task Force on PHPT. A comprehensive literature search for relevant studies was undertaken. After extensive review and discussion, the subgroup agreed on what recommendations should be made to the Expert Panel regarding surgical approaches to parathyroidectomy.

Conclusions

1) All patients with PHPT who meet surgical criteria should be referred to an experienced endocrine surgeon to discuss the risks, benefits, and potential complications of surgery. 2) Patients who do not meet surgical criteria and in whom there are no medical contraindications to surgery may request a visit with an experienced endocrine surgeon. Alternatively, a multidisciplinary endocrine conference with surgeon involvement could be employed to address all relevant issues. 3) Imaging is not a diagnostic procedure; it is a localization procedure to help the surgeon optimize the operative plan. 4) The frequency of hereditary forms of PHPT may be underappreciated and needs to be assessed with increased vigilance. And 5) surgery is likely to benefit patients due to high cure rates, low complication rates, and the likelihood of reversing skeletal manifestations.

### Imaging techniques in parathyroid surgery for primary hyperparathyroidism [^117SAzJp]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2011). Low credibility.

As more patients present with the incidental diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism due to biochemical screening, treatment guidelines have been developed for the treatment of hyperparathyroidism. Management of primary hyperparathyroidism has evolved in recent years, with considerable interest in minimally invasive approaches. Successful localization of the diseased gland(s) by nuclear imaging and anatomical studies, along with rapid intraoperative parathyroid hormone assay, has allowed for focused and minimally invasive surgical approaches. Patients in whom the localization studies have identified single-gland adenoma or unilateral disease are candidates for such focused approaches instead of the traditional approach of bilateral exploration. These imaging techniques have also been critical in the successful management of patients with persistent or recurrent disease.

### What can we learn from intraoperative parathyroid hormone levels that Do not drop appropriately? [^1111Dd4c]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Parathyroidectomy remains the only definitive treatment for primary hyperparathyroidism. We studied our large series of parathyroidectomies to identify factors predictive of failure to meet intraoperative parathyroid hormone (IOPTH) monitoring criteria.

Methods

We performed a retrospective cohort review of patients who underwent initial parathyroidectomy for primary hyperparathyroidism with IOPTH monitoring. Primary outcome was intraoperative failure, defined as failure to decrease IOPTH by ≥ 50% and into normal range. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to determine factors associated with intraoperative failure. A subset analysis evaluated 6-month outcomes.

Results

Of 2,185 subjects, 5.0% (n = 110) experienced intraoperative failure. The intraoperative failure group had more multigland disease (35.2 vs. 16.6%, p < 0.001) and smaller glands (1.3 vs. 1.5 cm, p = 0.048) compared to patients who experienced intraoperative success. On multivariate analysis, PTH level was statistically, but not clinically, significantly associated with intraoperative failure (odds ratio 1.0, 95% confidence interval 1.000–1.003). Persistent hyperparathyroidism was identified in 2.5% (n = 15) of 592 patients with ≥ 6 month follow-up. Median IOPTH decrease was lower in patients with persistent hyperparathyroidism (67.1 vs. 85.8%, p < 0.001). IOPTH criteria were 93.7% sensitive and 40.0% specific for eucalcemia 6 months postoperatively. Of 15 patients with persistent hyperparathyroidism, 7 underwent reoperation with a 100% cure rate. Reoperative diagnoses included ectopic mediastinal glands (n = 3), hyperplasia (n = 3), and missed second adenoma (n = 1).

Conclusions

Intraoperative failure is associated with higher rates of multigland disease and smaller parathyroid glands. Patients with persistent disease had significantly lower decreases in IOPTH, but half of patients who experienced failure by IOPTH criteria were eucalcemic 6 months postoperatively. All patients undergoing reoperation experienced successful cure.

### Unexpected results using rapid intraoperative parathyroid hormone monitoring during parathyroidectomy for primary hyperparathyroidism [^111dFav9]. World Journal of Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Rapid intraoperative parathyroid hormone (RIOPTH) monitoring predicts complete removal of all hypersecreting tissue by means of a significant parathyroid hormone (PTH) decrease. In this study we have tried to provide an explanation for some unexpected results of RIOPTH monitoring observed during a series of 125 conventional parathyroidectomies for primary hyperthyroidism, discussing the possible consequences on the surgical strategy. Three main groups can be recognized: (1) spikes: a PTH increase 10 minutes after removal of the diseased gland was observed in three patients; (2) false-negative results: six patients showed an inadequate PTH decreases at 10 minutes, three of them resulting in cure at 20 minutes (all six patients were cured at follow-up); (3) false-positive results: five patients with multiglandular disease showed a PTH decrease to a cure level despite excision of one adenoma only (in two of these patients a 20-minute sample showed a PTH increase soon after manipulation of the second adenoma). We concluded that the spike, almost certainly a consequence of manipulating the adenoma, when detected should be considered the "true" baseline value. False-negative results are to some extent related to undetected spikes. The assay used for RIOPTH determination and PTH half-life variability may also play a role. A false-negative result usually prolongs the surgical time. False-positive results are usually related to a double adenoma, one functionally prevailing over the other. Because in our experience manipulation of the second adenoma brought a PTH increase detected with RIOPTH monitoring, we believe that the second adenoma should be excised.

### Intraoperative parathyroid hormone measurement during minimally invasive parathyroidectomy: does it "value-add" to decision-making? [^116Njsy1]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Routine use of intraoperative parathyroid hormone levels (IOPTH) during minimally invasive parathyroidectomy (MIP) has been challenged simply because the test works best when needed least, ie, once a solitary adenoma has been resected, and is less accurate with multiple gland disease. It has also been shown not to be cost-effective. The aim of this study was to determine if IOPTH "value-added" to decision-making during MIP.

Study Design

The study group comprised 100 consecutive patients with sporadic hyperparathyroidism and an unequivocally positive sestamibi scan who were undergoing MIP in our unit from June 2004 until October 2005, from whom blood was collected for parathyroid hormone measurement preoperatively, preexcision, and at 10 and 30 minutes postremoval. No action was taken on the results of the test.

Results

Ninety-eight patients were cured by MIP alone. Two patients had persistent hyperparathyroidism, one of whom was cured with subsequent open reexploration and removal of a second adenoma, and the other remains hypercalcemic despite additional open neck exploration. IOPTH in both patients failed to fall in retrospect, only the first would have been cured by conversion at the time of operation. The value-added accuracy of IOPTH was really only 1%. In an additional nine patients, IOPTH at 10 minutes had failed to fall by > 50% from the highest level, those patients (9%) would have been subjected to an unnecessary conversion on the basis of a false-negative result.

Conclusions

IOPTH does not substantially value-add to decision-making during MIP. Most patients will be cured with appropriate selection for MIP based on preoperative localization studies.

### The need for intraoperative parathyroid hormone monitoring during radioguided parathyroidectomy by video-assisted thoracoscopy (VATS) [^113g96D5]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose

We report on a patient with primary hyperparathyroidism (1HPT) who had a preoperative Tc-99m sestamibi scan localizing a single parathyroid adenoma in the mediastinum.

Methods

On removal of this hyperfunctioning adenoma by radioguided video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS), intraoperative PTH levels failed to decline in the appropriate manner consistent with curative resection. This prompted the surgical team to investigate further for a second adenoma, which revealed a 2 x 1-cm mass near the inferior border of the thyroid gland on the right lateral aspect of the trachea.

Results

In the absence of intraoperative PTH monitoring, the operation would have been terminated after the removal of the mediastinal adenoma, leading to an incomplete surgical resection and persistent 1HPT.

Conclusion

In our patient, curative resection was obtained and a second operation was avoided because of the use of intraoperative PTH monitoring. This case also emphasizes that although VATS was planned, in treating patients with 1HPT, one must also be prepared to perform a neck exploration.

### Utility of intraoperative parathyroid hormone monitoring in patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1-associated primary hyperparathyroidism undergoing initial parathyroidectomy [^117C71ep]. World Journal of Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Intraoperative parathyroid hormone monitoring (IOPTH) is a widely used adjunct for primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT). However, the benefit of IOPTH in familial pHPT, such as in multiple endocrine neoplasia type I (MEN1), remains unclear.

Methods

We performed a retrospective analysis of 52 patients with MEN1-associated pHPT undergoing initial parathyroidectomy with IOPTH monitoring at our institution. Parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels were measured before skin incision and 10 min after resection of the last parathyroid gland. Variables analyzed included percent drop of PTH from baseline and the final PTH level compared to the normal reference range (RR).

Results

A total of 52 patients underwent initial subtotal parathyroidectomy with IOPTH. An IOPTH decrease cutoff of ≥ 75% from baseline had the highest biochemical cure rate (87%). In the remaining 13% who met this cutoff, all had persistent pHPT, with ≥ 90% drop of PTH from baseline. The remaining patients, who did not meet the ≥ 75% cutoff, were cured. Follow-up was available for three of four patients with final IOPTH levels above the RR: one had persistent pHPT, two had hypoparathyroidism (50%). When a postresection PTH level was within the RR, 88% of patients were cured. While considered cured from pHPT, 7% of patients in this group developed permanent hypoparathyroidism. When the final PTH level dropped below the RR, 28% developed permanent hypoparathyroidism.

Conclusions

A cutoff in IOPTH decrease of ≥ 75% from baseline has the highest biochemically cure rate in patients with pHPT associated with MEN1. However, a 75% cutoff in IOPTH decrease does not exclude persistent pHPT. The absolute IOPTH value does not accurately predict postoperative hypoparathyroidism.

### Minimally invasive parathyroidectomy… [^1139yp7R]. JAMA Network (2009). Excellent credibility.

Sestamibi scan demonstrating an adenoma of the left inferior parathyroid gland. Surgical results in patients with discordant preoperative minimally invasive parathyroidectomy studies. MIBI indicates sestamibi scanning; US, ultrasonography. A plus sign indicates that the procedure was performed; a minus sign, that it was not. © 2024 Objectives To review minimally invasive parathyroidectomy in patients undergoing initial surgical management of primary hyperparathyroidism with preoperative, localizing sestamibi scanning, and concordant ultrasonography to determine if intraoperative parathyroid hormone is necessary in these cases. Minimally invasive parathyroidectomy has become an acceptable therapeutic option in treating primary HPT. Preoperative MIBI scanning, high-resolution US with color Doppler flow, and iPTH monitoring have refined this technique. Results The mean decrease in PTH level was 85%.

Of the 428 patients with primary HPT included in the study, 209 patients had localizing, concordant preoperative MIBI and US. A decline of more than 50% in iPTH levels was observed in 202 patients after removal of parathyroid tissue localized by MIBI and US. The procedures for 4 patients were converted to bilateral neck explorations after the postexcision PTH level failed to drop less than 50%. No longer an uncommon disease, primary hyperparathyroidism is the most common cause of hypercalcemia in nonhospitalized patients. It affects nearly 1 in 500 women and 1 in 2000 men per year, most often in their fifth, sixth, and seventh decades of life. 1 Recently, more asymptomatic healthy adults have been diagnosed as a result of more routine screening laboratory blood work drawn on yearly checkups. Sestamibi scans and ultrasonography are now commonly used for the preoperative localization of hyperfunctioning parathyroid glands.

Although the 1991 National Institutes of Health Consensus Statement3 declared that no imaging study was necessary prior to initial parathyroidectomy, the use of MIBI scans and US has allowed for expanded application of minimally invasive surgery. Both studies have been shown to be highly specific in localizing disease with variable sensitivity.
3. Rapid iPTH assays, introduced in 1988, have been useful in recent years serving as "biological frozen sections" to confirm removal of all hyperfunctioning parathyroid tissue. The PTH molecule has a short half-life, allowing it to serve as a practical intraoperative marker. A previous study5 suggested that a 50% drop in venous PTH levels by 20 minutes after adenoma excision is an accepted criterion for curative surgery. We reviewed our experience with MIP in patients undergoing initial surgical management for primary HPT who demonstrated preoperative localization by MIBI scanning and US.

We sought to determine if iPTH is necessary in this subset of patients and if there is potential to reduce operative time and costs by omitting them. This was presumed to be a single adenoma by definition. A nonlocalizing MIBI scan was defined as one that did not localize to a single gland or identified bilateral, hyperfunctioning parathyroid glands.
6. All patients underwent high-resolution US with color Doppler flow with interpretation by attending radiologists. Gray-scale imaging extended from the carotid arteries laterally to the midline and from the hyoid bone superiorly to the thoracic inlet. Parathyroid adenomas were characteristically oval-shaped, with Doppler flow showing an extrathyroidal feeding vessel entering the gland at one of the poles. Internal vascularity was usually in a peripheral distribution.
7. Using a skin crease, a small curvilinear transverse cervical incision was made in the low anterior aspect of the neck.

Discussion

PHPT is a common endocrine disease characterized by elevated or inappropriate secretion of serum PTH level and increased serum calcium. The most common cause of pHPT is single parathyroid adenoma, which accounts for 80% of all cases. Rarely, it can be caused by parathyroid carcinoma or parathyroid cyst. The first line treatment for pHPT is resection of the lesion. However, precise identification of the lesion location, which can contribute to the increased rate of successful surgery, is still a clinical challenge. In clinical practice, there are many methods to detect and locate hyperactive parathyroid tissue, such as neck US, MIBI, CT, MRI, and SVS. In our patient, the cause of most symptoms and laboratory results were preliminarily attributed to the excessive secretion of PTH in the right lower parathyroid adenoma with corresponding results of neck US, MRI, and MIBI in the local hospital. Generally, the only definitive treatment for pHPT is surgical removal of the lesion, although some drugs such as bisphosphonates have shown some effects. Therefore, this patient subsequently underwent surgery in the local hospital. During the operation, the frozen section analysis indicated thyroid tissue rather than parathyroid tissue and the intraoperative PTH measurement showed no significant decrease. Considering frozen section analysis and intraoperative PTH measurement could not always provide the final definitive diagnosis, the surgeons at the local hospital decided not to perform further neck exploration and terminate the operation to avoid unnecessary damage and prolonging the operation time after communicating with the patient's family members. However, her serum calcium and PTH levels were still abnormal within 6 months after the surgery, which is when persistent pHPT (P-pHPT) was confirmed. This process highlights the need for more precise preoperative localization and cautious surgery, especially when there are other masses present. In such cases, the involvement of internal medicine physicians in the Multi-Disciplinary Treatment (MDT) is also needed. Among patients with pHPT, previous studies showed that the persistence or recurrence of the condition occured in 2.5–5% of cases. The reasons for P-pHPT may include inexperienced surgeons, inaccurate imaging, and ectopic parathyroids. In this case, a second operation was needed that would inevitably experience lower success rate than the primary operation; additionally, the second operation is typically more difficult and challenging, given the long operation time and high risk of complications. Precise preoperative lesion identification examinations are required and are paramount to improve the success rate of reoperation.

### Impact of intraoperative intact PTH monitoring on reoperation rates and surgical success in primary hyperparathyroidism [^117SetBE]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Results

Of the 203 patients included in the study, 163 (80.3%) were female. The mean age of the patients was 54.6 ± 12.7 years. Patients were divided into two groups: Group A (n = 93) underwent intraoperative PTH measurement, whereas Group B (n = 110) did not (Table 1).

Table 1
Gender and age distribution of patients

SD: standard deviation. n: number

The localizations of the parathyroid glands that were considered pathological during intraoperative evaluation and excised as single glands were analyzed. The most common localization was the left inferior (n = 77, 37.9%), followed by the right inferior (n = 71, 35%), left superior (n = 14, 6.9%), and right superior (n = 6, 3%). In addition, 22 patients (10.8%) had ectopic parathyroid glands, located in the retrosternal area (n = 8), thyrothymic ligament (n = 6), carotid sheath (n = 3), intrathyroidal region (n = 3), and anterior mediastinum (n = 2).

More than one gland was excised in 13 patients; in all of them, no more than two glands were removed. In 5 (2.5%) of these cases, the excised glands were unilateral, while in 8 (3.9%) they were bilateral. Preoperative imaging findings (USG, SPECT, and Tc-99 m sestamibi) and intraoperative localization results were recorded and analyzed. Multifocality was initially suspected intraoperatively based on the removal of more than one parathyroid lesion, but final classification was confirmed by histopathological examination. Cases in which more than one lesion was removed were considered multifocal (Table 2).

### New point-of-care intraoperative parathyroid hormone assay for intraoperative guidance in parathyroidectomy [^112kULaB]. World Journal of Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

The use of the intraoperative parathyroid hormone assay (QPTH) to guide a limited parathyroidectomy in patients with sporadic primary hyperparathyroidism (SPHPT) is well established. The advantage of having this assay performed in the operating room is immediate feedback for (1) confirming the complete excision of all hyperfunctioning parathyroid(s); (2) differential jugular venous sampling for localization; and (3) diagnosing suspected tissue without histopathology. For these reasons, the reliability of the hormone measurement and a short assay turnaround time are essential for surgical guidance. We report our experience using a new "point-of-care" assay for intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH). A new two-site chemiluminescent immunometric assay was used. The antibodies are inside a microtiter well, where the iPTH is measured by a strip luminometer after incubation for 5 minutes. Sixteen frozen samples were measured simultaneously using the traditional iPTH assay and this new assay for comparison. Fifty-one patients with SPHPT underwent parathyroidectomy guided by this new assay. The criteria used to predict postoperative normocalcemia was a drop in the hormone level of ≤ 50% from the highest preincision or preexcision levels at 10 minutes after excision of all hypersecreting gland(s). The correlation between the traditional and new assays was 0.98. The assay predicted the postoperative calcium levels in all patients except one (false negative-delayed drop). The assay turnaround time was 8 minutes. This new point-of-care assay is reliable for predicting postoperative calcium levels when used with the described criteria. It has advantages over the traditional assay in that it is faster and easier to perform.

### Surgical management of primary hyperparathyroidism: the case for giving up quick intraoperative PTH assay in favor of routine PTH measurement the morning after… [^113iK8qS]. Annals of Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To analyze the utility of quick intraoperative parathyroid hormone (PTH) measurement in the surgical management of primary hyperparathyroidism.

Background Data

The use of intraoperative PTH monitoring is well established in the surgery of primary hyperparathyroidism. However, some false-negative predictions lead to unnecessary explorations; furthermore, surgeons are becoming increasingly dependent on hormone measurement for intraoperative decisions, which raises concerns about the cost-effectiveness of the method.

Methods

A retrospective analysis of 268 neck explorations performed for primary hyperparathyroidism using intraoperative PTH monitoring from April 2001 to February 2003 was done. We used the criterion of "biologic recovery" of hyperfunctioning tissue, defined as a more than 50% decrease in PTH level from baseline value at 5 minutes after excision to predict the outcome of successful parathyroidectomy documented by normal postoperative serum calcium level. Additionally, we also sampled PTH at 10 minutes, 30 minutes, and the morning after surgery to compare the predictive value of delayed sampling. Patients were classified according to the prediction being concordant or discordant with the outcome. The data were analyzed using a 2 x 2 table construct for each of the sampling times, therefore providing sequential sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and overall accuracy of the predictions.

Results

Concordance or overall accuracy of prediction (true positives and negatives) was obtained in 229 cases (85.4%), and discordance or failure of prediction (false positives and negatives) was obtained in 34 cases (12.7%) at T5. On analyzing the iPTH prediction at T10, T30, and D1 among the group of 33 false negatives, we found that 28 (10.4%) patients reached the concordance at 30 minutes, while by the first day 32 patients (12.3%) had achieved concordance. Thus, there was a progressive increase in sensitivity and overall accuracy, but more importantly, in the negative predictive value reaching 88.9% on the day after surgery.

Conclusions

The method of sampling PTH intraoperatively at 5 minutes has a high positive predictive value (99.5%) but a low negative predictive value (19.5%), which can lead to unnecessary explorations and a delay in the operative procedure. The negative predictive value increases substantially at 30 minutes and is best on the day after surgery. We suggest giving up the intraoperative measurement of PTH to adopt the first day postoperative measurement of PTH as a predictor of successful parathyroidectomy.

### The small abnormal parathyroid gland is increasingly common and heralds operative complexity [^1148DdVR]. World Journal of Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Over decades, improvements in presymptomatic screening and awareness of surgical benefits have changed the presentation and management of primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT). Unrecognized multiglandular disease (MGD) remains a major cause of operative failure. We hypothesized that during parathyroid surgery the initial finding of a mildly enlarged gland is now frequent and predicts both MGD and failure.

Methods

A prospective database was queried to examine the outcomes of initial exploration for sporadic PHPT using intraoperative PTH monitoring (IOPTH) over 15 years. All patients had follow-up ≥ 6 months (mean = 1.8 years). Cure was defined by normocalcemia at 6 months and microadenoma by resected weight of < 200 mg.

Results

Of the 1,150 patients, 98.9% were cured and 15% had MGD. The highest preoperative calcium level decreased over time (p < 0.001) and varied directly with adenoma weight (p < 0.001). Over time, single adenoma weight dropped by half (p = 0.002) and microadenoma was increasingly common (p < 0.01). MGD risk varied inversely with weight of first resected abnormal gland. Microadenoma required bilateral exploration more often than macroadenoma (48 vs. 18%, p < 0.01). When at exploration the first resected gland was < 200 mg, the rates of MGD (40 vs. 11%, p = 0.001), inadequate initial IOPTH drop (67 vs. 79%, p = 0.002), operative failure (6.6 vs. 0.7%, p < 0.001), and long-term recurrence (1.6 vs. 0.3%, p = 0.007) were higher.

Conclusions

Single parathyroid adenomas are smaller than in the past and require more complex pre- and intraoperative management. During exploration for sporadic PHPT, a first abnormal gland < 200 mg should heighten suspicion of MGD and presages a tenfold higher failure rate.

### Investigating the effectiveness of intraoperative rapid parathyroid hormone assay in parathyroidectomy surgery in patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism [^115nj55x]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) is one of the most common complications of chronic kidney disease (CKD), in which the homeostasis of calcium and phosphorus is impaired. This complication is associated with significant morbidity and mortality in patients requiring renal replacement therapy. However, SHPT often needs proper treatment as it does not resolve spontaneously with kidney transplantation. Management can be achieved by pharmacologic agents such as calcimimetics, calcium supplements, phosphor binders, and Calcitriol, as well as surgical interventions like total and subtotal parathyroidectomy, which are usually indicated when the patient does not respond to medical therapy.

Attempts have been made to avoid surgical and management complications. Such interventions might not be successful and present as persistent hyperparathyroidism due to ectopic and additional parathyroid glands. On the other hand, unnecessary exploration of the neck region can cause multiple complications as damage to recurrent laryngeal nerves. In this regard, real-time monitoring of the decline in plasma parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels, such as Intraoperative parathyroid hormone (Io-PTH) measurement, can result in fewer complications of parathyroidectomy by proving further exploration and surgical resections unnecessary. In this study, we aimed to assess the effectiveness of Io-PTH measurement in the success of total and subtotal parathyroidectomy SHPT surgeries.

### Surgical treatment of patients with mildly elevated parathormone and calcium levels [^112eAkUK]. World Journal of Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with mildly elevated parathormone (PTH) and calcium levels consistent for primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT) may present with more underlying multiglandular disease (MGD) and higher operative failure and recurrence rates than those with conventional, or "classic" pHPT. This study compared the clinical characteristics and surgical outcomes of patients with biochemically mild versus conventional pHPT.

Methods

A series of 707 consecutive patients underwent initial targeted parathyroidectomy with intraoperative parathormone monitoring (IPM) at a single institution. Biochemically mild (BM) pHPT was defined as PTH > 65 and < 100 pg/ml with serum calcium > 10.4 and < 11 mg/dl. Conventional pHPT was defined as calcium ≥ 11 mg/dl and PTH ≥ 100 pg/ml. Prospectively collected data for all patients, including operative indication, preoperative laboratory values, imaging, IPM dynamics, and postoperative laboratory values were retrospectively reviewed. Additional assessments included presence of MGD, bilateral neck exploration (BNE), single-gland volume, and operative failure or success, and recurrence.

Results

Of 60 patients with BM-pHPT, 46 reported preoperative bone pain, kidney stones, fatigue, and/or mental disturbances. The remaining 14 BM-pHPT patients underwent parathyroidectomy based on published asymptomatic guidelines. Patients with BM-pHPT had significantly more kidney stones, MGD, and BNE. Average single-gland volume and postoperative PTH levels were significantly lower in BM-pHPT patients. There were no significant differences between groups regarding preoperative localization accuracy, IPM dynamics, or operative success/failure, recurrence rates.

Conclusions

BM-pHPT patients had more MGD requiring BNE but achieved operative success rates similar to those of patients with conventional disease. IPM successfully identifies MGD in BM-pHPT patients, who should be counseled regarding more extensive operations than limited parathyroidectomy.

### Directed parathyroid exploration: evolution and evaluation of this approach in a single-institution review of 346 patients [^116o7pUW]. The Laryngoscope (2003). Low credibility.

Objectives/Hypothesis

Critical evaluation of a directed exploration protocol used by a single surgeon in the management of surgical parathyroid disease.

Study Design

Retrospective chart review was made of patients surgically managed for hyperparathyroidism at an academic tertiary care center.

Methods

Three hundred forty-six patients were evaluated for biochemically proven hyperparathyroidism between March 1995 and February 2002. A directed exploration protocol was implemented in appropriately selected patients with primary hyperparathyroidism and in patients with secondary or tertiary hyperparathyroidism requiring repeat operation. The protocol included preoperative technetium-99m sestamibi imaging for hyperfunctional parathyroid localization, targeted neck exploration, rapid intraoperative parathyroid hormone determination, and limited-stay discharge from the ambulatory surgical recovery unit. Data collection was accomplished by entering patient evaluation, management, and outcome information prospectively into collective case report forms. A retrospective analysis of the data was conducted for the purpose of evaluating the effectiveness of the protocol.

Results

Sustained normocalcemia beyond 6 months postoperatively was achieved in 323 of 327 (99%) patients with primary hyperparathyroidism. Eighty-four percent (84%) of patients with secondary or tertiary hyperparathyroidism achieved normocalcemia or had resolution of symptoms as a measure of therapeutic success. The complication rate for the entire series of patients was 2.8%. Ninety-two percent of positive findings on sestamibi scan correctly predicted the location of an adenoma, whereas a negative finding accurately predicted the absence of an enlarged gland in a "usual" location in 81% of patients. Twenty-six patients (9%) had a false-positive finding on the scan, whereby a solitary adenoma was found contralateral to the side indicated by the scan. Overall, the positive predictive value for sestamibi imaging in the series was 91%. Intraoperative parathyroid hormone determination yielded an overall rate of reduction of 80% from preoperative levels during directed exploration. Sustained normocalcemia was achieved in all patients in whom intraoperative parathyroid hormone determination demonstrated a minimum decline of 50% from preoperative levels following resection of hyperfunctional parathyroid tissue (adenoma[s]). The majority (72%) of patients were managed in an outpatient (ambulatory surgery) setting and were discharged to home within 8 to 12 hours after surgery.

Conclusion

The directed exploration protocol for surgical management of hyperparathyroidism generated surgical rates of success that were as good as and, in most cases, improved over that of traditional bilateral exploration. This achievement was associated with low morbidity and reduced time and facility utilization, conveying improved cost-effectiveness. This surgical strategy should serve to enhance the capability of the surgeon to safely and efficiently manage the majority of patients with surgical parathyroid disease.

### Intraoperative parathyroid hormone levels at 5 min can identify multigland disease [^112U3ETy]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Intraoperative parathyroid hormone (IOPTH) monitoring is crucial in the treatment of primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT). Often, the 5 min IOPTH levels fall, but not by the requisite 50%. In such cases, the surgeon must decide whether to wait for additional levels or to continue exploration. This study aimed to evaluate the 5 min drop in IOPTH for distinguishing single adenomas (SA) from multigland disease.

Methods

A retrospective analysis of a prospectively collected database was performed on PHPT patients who underwent initial curative parathyroidectomy between 2001 and 2013. Those with familial disease and those taking lithium or undergoing concomitant thyroidectomy were excluded from the analysis. For cases of double adenomas (DA) or hyperplasia (HA), the IOPTH values indicating additional glands were analyzed.

Results

The inclusion criteria were met by 1021 patients: 817 patients with SA (82.2%), 99 patients with DA (10%), and 78 with HA (7.9%). The SA patients exhibited a 56.6 ± 4.9% decline in IOPTH at 5 min compared with 21.3 ± 4.5% of the DA patients and 22.5 ± 4.3% of the HA patients (p < 0.01). Post hoc comparisons showed that the 5 min decrease in the SA group was significantly greater than in either the DA group or the HA group (p < 0.01). A 5 min percentage decline of 35% best distinguished SA from multiglandular disease (85.3 vs. 24.9%).

Conclusion

The data suggest that when IOPTH level does not drop by at least 35% at 5 min after excision, the surgeon should consider further exploration rather than wait for additional levels.

### A prospective evaluation of quick intraoperative parathyroid hormone assay at the time of skin closure in predicting clinically relevant hypocalcemia after thyroidectomy [^114mZVSY]. World Journal of Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Discussion

Transient hypoparathyroidism is a major reason for delayed hospital discharge following a total or completion total thyroidectomy because potentially life-threatening hypocalcemic symptoms may not occur until 24–48 h after surgery. Among the various strategies proposed to optimize the management of postoperative hypocalcemia by shortening hospital stay, PTH-directed selective supplementation is a safe and effective approach. However, many PTH criteria have been proposed by previous authors to predict which patients are at risk of developing clinically relevant postoperative hypocalcemia. In general, these criteria can be categorized into two main approaches, namely, focusing on the percentage drop in PTH level from the preoperative to the postoperative period or simply measuring a single postoperative PTH level some time after surgery with a cutoff value. We chose the latter approach because there was no need for drawing blood multiple times; this reduced the clinical workload and the overall cost of PTH testing. In regard to the timing, two evidence-based reviews suggested a single PTH measurement taken any time from 10 min to several hours after surgery seemed to provide equally accurate predictive results. Barczynski et al. compared the accuracy between PTH-SC and PTH at 4 h after surgery and found no significant difference. With the advantages of reduced pain, being logistically easier, and the PTH results coming back sooner, the accuracy and reliability of PTH-SC was evaluated.

MEN1 primary hyperparathyroidism — postoperative surveillance states that for multigland disease, lifelong cure may not be possible and the goal of surgery may be defined as normal calcium homeostasis and an extended time to recurrence rather than cure; postoperatively, serum calcium should be checked at 6 months to confirm normocalcemia; some patients may have an elevated PTH with normal serum calcium after surgery, which may indicate an increased risk of recurrent PHPT; therefore, annual and long-term follow-up with serum calcium, serum phosphorus, and PTH may be appropriate.

### Normocalcaemic primary hyperparathyroidism: what is the role of parathyroid surgery? [^1152C9bE]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Parathyroidectomy and biochemical 'cure'

Trinh et al. in their study of 616 patients (nPHPT = 119, hPHPT = 497), investigated the role of intraoperative PTH monitoring in the management of nPHPT. A significantly lower percentage of nPHPT (97%) patients demonstrated a > 50% fall in their IOPTH levels compared with those with hPHPT (99%). The drop of > 50% was 82.9% predictive of a long-term biochemical cure in nPHPT patients, which was not significantly different from the predictive value for hPHPT patients (p = 0.90). Trinh et al. concluded that a stricter threshold should be used during parathyroidectomy, such that if a > 50% fall in IOPTH does not occur within a 10-min period or if there is small abnormal glandular disease, bilateral exploration should be initiated.

### Surgical and calcium outcomes in 427 patients treated prospectively in an image-guided and intraoperative PTH (IOPTH) supplemented protocol for primary hyperparathyroidism: outcomes and opportunities [^112i2oYo]. The Laryngoscope (2009). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Unilateral exploration based upon preoperative imaging has become increasingly applied in the management of patients with primary hyperparathyroidism. Unilateral surgical exploration purportedly has high rates of disease control, limited morbidity, and shortened operative time. Unfortunately, significant cohorts of patients with primary hyperparathyroidism are unable to have abnormal glands localized on preoperative imaging evaluation.

Aim

The aim of our study was to evaluate the efficacy of Tc(99m) sestamibi preoperative imaging, intraoperative Tc(99m) sestamibi with gamma probe, and intraoperative parathyroid hormone (IOPTH) assessment in a large cohort of patients with primary hyperparathyroidism.

Results

A total of 427 patients were prospectively evaluated who were deemed surgical candidates for the treatment of primary hyperparathyroidism. Of these patients, 240 (56%) presented with positive Tc(99m) sestamibi imaging. Another 105 (25%) presented with equivocal Tc(99m) sestamibi imaging. Finally, 82 (19%) presented with negative Tc(99m) sestamibi imaging. Intraoperative rapid assessment of parathyroid hormone was performed at the time of surgical exploration in all patients with negative and equivocal preoperative imaging. All 240 patients with positive preoperative imaging underwent unilateral surgical exploration utilizing intraoperative Tc(99m) sestamibi with gamma probe. The most common finding in the positive Tc(99m) sestamibi scan group was single adenoma in 235 (98%). Normocalcemia was achieved in 233 (97%) of these patients, although in 25 (10%) this was normocalcemia with a persistent elevation in parathyroid hormone (PTH). The most common surgical finding in the equivocal Tc(99m) sestamibi scan group was single adenoma in 85 (81%). Additionally 85 (81%) of these equivocal patients were able to undergo unilateral exploration limited by IOPTH assessment. Normocalcemia was achieved in 101/105 (96%) of patients; although, 10 patients were normocalcemic with persistently elevated PTH and 2 patients had normocalcemia with low PTH. All patients with negative Tc(99m) sestamibi scan underwent bilateral cervical exploration plus IOPTH; 52/82 (63%) were found to have a single adenoma which was the most common surgical finding. Normocalcemia was achieved in 77/82 (94%) of the negative Tc(99m) sestamibi cohort; although 5 patients had normocalcemia with persistently elevated PTH and 2 had normocalcemia with low PTH. Only 3 (0.7%) overall recurrent laryngeal nerve injuries were encountered, and only 1 (0.2%) was permanent. Wound complication rates are reported in detail and were low and comparable for all three Tc(99m) sestamibi imaging based cohorts.

Conclusions

Tc(99m) sestamibi preoperative imaging, intraoperative Tc(99m) sestamibi with gamma probe, IOPTH, and combinations of these strategies allow for excellent opportunities for targeted excision of pathologic parathyroid tissue with the least dissection necessary while achieving excellent long-term calcium control and low rates of complication.

### SNM practice guideline for parathyroid scintigraphy 4.0 [^113Z5FvJ]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine Technology (2012). Medium credibility.

Common clinical indications — parathyroid scintigraphy is specifically designed to localize parathyroid adenomas or parathyroid hyperplasia in patients with hyperparathyroidism that is determined on the basis of elevated parathyroid hormone levels in the setting of an elevated serum calcium level, and with present-day minimally invasive parathyroidectomy, preoperative parathyroid scintigraphy may be extremely useful in reducing the duration or extent of surgical exploration. Parathyroid scintigraphy may also be indicated for localization of hyperfunctioning parathyroid tissue in patients with persistent or recurrent disease, and in this population ectopic tissue is more prevalent and preoperative localization will likely increase surgical success, in part by helping to direct the surgical approach. For intraoperative localization, using a γ-probe or a small camera can be helpful, particularly in patients with persistent or recurrent disease, especially those who have undergone previous surgical exploration, and combining intraoperative parathyroid hormone assays with minimally invasive surgery may improve success rates for complete cure.

### Intraoperative parathyroid hormone assay improves outcomes of minimally invasive parathyroidectomy mainly in patients with a presumed solitary parathyroid adenoma and missing concordance of preoperative imaging [^117Nwzdb]. Clinical Endocrinology (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

Intraoperative parathyroid hormone assay (IOPTH) is often used during minimally invasive parathyroidectomy (MIP) for primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT). However, several investigators have reported conflicting outcomes, throwing doubt on the real influence of this adjunct on surgical decision-making. The aim of this study was to determine the impact of routine use of IOPTH on the success rate of MIP as the primary outcome, and whether it value-added to surgical decision-making during the operations at our institution.

Design

The results of MIP were determined on postoperative follow-up in 177 consecutive patients with pHPT and compared with the results of preoperative imaging, findings at surgery and the value-added accuracy of IOPTH in surgical decisions.

Patients

All 177 patients had biochemically documented pHPT and all were referred for first-time surgery.

Measurements

Group 1 patients (n = 62) underwent a unilateral neck exploration (UNE) without IOPTH, and group 2 patients (n = 115) underwent MIP (either video-assisted or open) with IOPTH. The primary outcome was the cure rate, whereas the secondary outcome was the value-adding of IOPTH to surgical decision-making during MIP.

Results

Of the group 1 vs. 2 patients, 57/62 (91.9%) vs. 114/115 (99.1%) were cured (P = 0.01). Five (8.1%) of the group 1 patients were hypercalcaemic postoperatively, owing to an additional, overlooked, hyperfunctioning parathyroid gland, whereas among the 115 group 2 patients, 104 (90.4%) underwent resection of a single parathyroid adenoma, met the Miami criterion, and were cured. The remaining 11 (9.6%) patients did not have an adequate reduction in parathyroid hormone levels and underwent further neck exploration, with resection of additional hyperfunctioning parathyroids in nine of them. One group 2 patient was not cured. However, a decrease of less than 50% of intraoperative parathyroid hormone (iPTH) assay correctly identified the risk of persistent disease in that patient. Another patient in group 2 had a false-negative IOPTH result. The value-added accuracy of IOPTH (correct assay-based surgeon's decision of further neck exploration) was demonstrated in 3 of 78 group 2 patients with concordant results of both imaging studies vs. 7 of 37 group 2 patients with only one positive imaging study, or 3.8 vs. 18.9% of patients (P = 0.007).

Conclusions

Routine use of IOPTH significantly improves cure rates of MIP in comparison to open image-guided UNE without IOPTH. It is a valuable adjunct in surgical decision-making, allowing for intraoperative recognition and resection of additional hyperfunctioning parathyroid tissue missed by preoperative imaging studies. IOPTH offers substantial value-adding to surgical decision-making, particularly in patients with only one positive imaging study result, and significantly improves the success rate of MIP in these patients. However, in patients with concordant results of two imaging studies, the assay offers significantly lower value-adding to surgical decisions, as a vast majority of patients are cured after removal of a two-image-indexed parathyroid lesion. Despite this, we strongly advocate routine use of IOPTH in all patients undergoing MIP, as this adjunct offers maximum safety for the patient and confidence for the surgeon.

### Clinical guidelines and PTH measurement: does assay generation matter? [^111g74q9]. Endocrine Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

PTH is an important regulator of calcium and phosphate homeostasis and bone remodeling. It is metabolized into PTH fragments, which are measured to a different extent by PTH assays of different generations because of differences in fragments recognized and lack of assay standardization. PTH is measured in the workup of several conditions, and clinical guidelines provide recommendations concerning these measurements. This review provides an overview of the impact of differences between PTH assays, applying distinct clinical guidelines for primary and secondary hyperparathyroidism and perioperative use of PTH measurements. Guidelines deal with PTH measurement in different ways, recommending either trend monitoring, the use of a fold increase of the upper reference limit, or an absolute PTH cutoff value. For classic primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT), the type of PTH assay used will not affect diagnosis or management because the precise concentration of PTH is less relevant. In chronic kidney disease, the guideline recommends treating secondary hyperparathyroidism above a twofold to ninefold PTH increase, which will result in different clinical decisions depending on the assay used. For patients after bariatric surgery, guidelines state absolute cutoff values for PTH, but the impact of different generation assays is unknown because direct comparison of PTH assays has never been performed. During parathyroid surgery, PTH measurements with a third-generation assay reflect treatment success more rapidly than second-generation assays. Increased awareness among clinicians regarding the complexity of PTH measurements is warranted because it can affect clinical decisions.

### Focused approach to parathyroidectomy [^116iTk1R]. World Journal of Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Minimally invasive parathyroidectomy is performed after preoperative parathyroid localization-usually with high-quality sestamibi scans and/or ultrasonography-often under cervical block anesthesia during which a limited exploration is performed. The rapid intraoperative parathyroid hormone assay is then employed to confirm an adequate resection and cure of primary hyperparathyroidism. This article discusses imaging, anesthesia, results, and the surgical management of patients undergoing minimally invasive parathyroidectomy.

### Focused cervical exploration for primary hyperparathyroidism without intraoperative parathyroid hormone monitoring or use of the gamma probe [^113iuwzQ]. World Journal of Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

Selected patients with primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT) who have a positive preoperative sestamibi scan can be managed safely and successfully with a focused cervical exploration without either adjuvant intraoperative parathyroid hormone (PTH) monitoring or use of a gamma probe. This article reports a retrospective analysis of a consecutive series of patients surgically treated at a tertiary referral center. From August 1998 to August 2002, 100 patients (68 women, 32 men; mean age 63 years [range: 29–89 years]) underwent a focused cervical approach without intraoperative PTH monitoring or use of the gamma probe after perioperative sestamibi injection. The study group comprised 9% of all patients (n = 1063) undergoing cervical exploration for pHPT during the study period. Ninety patients underwent an initial exploration, and 10 others underwent repeat cervical exploration following prior parathyroid (n = 7) or thyroid (n = 3) operation. Sestamibi scanning correlated with one enlarged parathyroid gland in all patients. Other enlarged glands were, however, not demonstrated in three patients (true positive = 97%; false negative = 3%). The single enlarged glands excised in all patients had a mean weight of 795 mg (range: 90–3640) and were histologically compatible with an adenoma. Postoperatively, 97% of patients were eucalcemic. Three patients remained hypercalcemic (3%). Of the three patients with persistent hypercalcemia, one underwent successful re-exploration with excision of a 500 mg second adenoma, whereas the other two patients (with confirmed familial HPT) remained hypercalcemic. Mean hospitalization was 0.5 days (range: 0–3 days). There was no operative mortality. No patients had permanent hypocalcemia. Postoperative morbidity occurred in three patients: two self-limiting cervical hematomas and one permanent vocal cord paralysis. Selected patients with pHPT due to single-gland disease and an unequivocally positive preoperative sestamibi scan can safely and successfully be managed with a focused unilateral cervical exploration without either intraoperative PTH monitoring or use of the gamma probe. Further experience with this surgical approach seems warranted to determine the overall cure rate, operative morbidity, and the sensitivity and specificity of preoperative localization studies.

Material and methods

Surgical strategy for primary hyperparathyroidism in MEN1 patients

Our previous standard surgical approach to MEN1 patients with primary hyperparathyroidism was STP. Preoperative localization studies were not routinely performed. A traditional bilateral neck exploration was performed, with inspection of all four parathyroid glands and identification of potential supernumerary glands. The most normal-appearing gland was then biopsied, marked with a clip, and a 50-mg remnant was left in situ to prevent postoperative hypoparathyroidism. The other three glands as well as the cervical thymus were removed.

Since 2000, with increasing and routine use of preoperative sestamibi scans and ultrasound, we began to identify a subgroup of MEN1 patients with a preoperatively located single abnormal parathyroid gland. For this subgroup of patients, we start the operation by finding and excising the abnormal gland, followed by excising the other gland on the same side as well as the ipsilateral cervical thymus. We use intraoperative PTH (IOPTH) monitoring to look for a significant drop. If the 10-min postexcision PTH adequately drops by more than 50% from baseline, the other side is not explored.

Patients

All patients with MEN1 and primary hyperparathyroidism, who had their initial operation at UCSF between 1995 and 2015 were included in the study. The diagnosis of MEN1 was based on (1) proven genetic mutation, (2) coexisting endocrine neoplastic disease in the pancreas, duodenum or pituitary gland, or (3) at least one first-degree relative with MEN1. This study was reviewed and approved by the local institutional review boards.

Outcomes

Persistent hyperparathyroidism was defined as elevated serum calcium levels with inappropriately elevated levels of PTH within 6 months of initial parathyroidectomy, and recurrent hyperparathyroidism as increased levels of calcium and PTH after at least 6 months of follow-up with normalization of serum levels of calcium and PTH after initial parathyroidectomy. Permanent hypoparathyroidism was defined by serum calcium levels below the normal range and requirement for supplemental calcium and vitamin D after 6 months following operation.

Serum calcium was measured using a UniCel DxC 800 Clinical system (Beckman Coulter), with reference level 8.8–10.3 mg/dL. Intraoperative PTH was measured using a UniCel DxI 600 Immunoassay system (Beckman Coulter). Intact PTH was measured with Immulite 2000 Immunoassay (Siemens Healthcare), with reference level of 12–65 ng/L.

### No need to abandon focused unilateral exploration for primary hyperparathyroidism with intraoperative monitoring of intact parathyroid hormone [^1112ZZvw]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2015). Low credibility.

Background

We investigated the rate of persistent and recurrent hyperparathyroidism after focused unilateral exploration (UE) with intraoperative monitoring of intact parathyroid hormone (IOPTH).

Study Design

A prospective cohort of 915 patients with primary hyperparathyroidism (PHP) underwent parathyroid surgery by a single surgeon from January 2003 to September 2013. A total of 556 patients with at least a single positive preoperative localization by ultrasound (US) and/or sestamibi scan (STS) underwent UE with IOPTH. The criterion for completion of surgery was an IOPTH fall of 50% from the highest intraoperative level and into the normal range 5 to 10 minutes after resection of the localized gland.

Results

Fifteen patients had either persistent or recurrent PHP, yielding a 2.7% (95% CI 1.6% to 4.4%) overall recurrence rate based on the refined Wilson method with continuity correction. Four patients had persistent PHP. Three of these patients were cured with reoperation, and the fourth patient was followed nonoperatively. Eleven patients had recurrent PHP, with 5 corrected by surgery and 6 patients followed nonoperatively. The mean postoperative serum calcium (Ca) level was 9.4 mg/dL over a mean follow-up interval of 44.0 months. Preoperative localization rates by each localization study were: US 74.3% (n = 413), STS 86.9% (n = 483), and US and STS 71.4% (n = 397). There was no difference in the preoperative study that localized the hyperfunctional parathyroid gland in recurrent vs nonrecurrent patients by the Fisher's exact test (US, p = 1.00; STS, p = 0.65; US and STS, p = 1.00).

Conclusions

The low rate of recurrent PHP after focused unilateral exploration with IOPTH suggests that this procedure should not be abandoned.

### Minimally invasive parathyroidectomy: 101 consecutive cases from a single surgeon [^116jbxpA]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Intraoperative rapid parathyroid hormone (iPTH) assay is changing parathyroid surgery. One surgeon's experience at a tertiary care hospital was followed as minimally invasive parathyroidectomy (MIP) was adopted.

Study Design

In this prospective case study, patients underwent technitium 99m sestamibi scanning, iPTH monitoring, and MIP. A sestamibi-directed incision was made, and iPTH was measured preincision, preexcision of abnormal gland(s), and at 5- and 10-minute intervals. MIP was complete after gland(s) was excised and iPTH fell to less than 50% of preoperative levels. Routine discharge was on the day of surgery with daily calcium and calcitriol to minimize outpatient hypocalcemia. Secondary and tertiary hyperparathyroidism patients were excluded.

Results

From December 1999 to June 2002, 101 patients underwent MIP. Patients were 27% men and 73% women, with two reoperations. Preoperation laboratory results averaged serum calcium 11.08 (normal 8.5 to 10.5 mg/dL) and parathyroid hormone (PTH) 169 pg/mL (normal 10 to 55 pg/mL). Average iPTH values at operative intervals were 152, 151, 68, and 50 pg/mL, respectively. Operation demonstrated 12% of patients had four-gland hyperplasia, 3% had double adenomas, 2% had parathyroid carcinomas, and 83% had single adenomas. Discharge on the day of surgery occurred in 83% of single-adenoma patients. Postoperative laboratory results averaged calcium 9.4 mg/dL (p < 0.001 versus preoperation) and PTH 48 pg/mL (p < 0.001). Fifteen patients (16%) had elevated PTH after operation, but without elevated calcium levels. One patient had persistant hyperparathyroidism.

Conclusions

MIP with iPTH monitoring is a safe and effective means of treating hyperparathyroidism. This approach allows for limited dissection and early discharge for the majority of patients.

### Characteristics, management and outcomes of primary hyperparathyroidism from 2009 to 2021: a single centre report from South Africa [^1126b4yV]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The proportion of asymptomatic PHPT has increased at this centre over the past decade but symptomatic disease remains the dominant presentation and is higher than that reported in developed countries. Parathyroid adenoma is the commonest cause of PHPT with parathyroidectomy being curative in the majority of patients. IO-PTH monitoring is valuable in guaranteeing successful surgery.

### Minimally invasive video-assisted parathyroidectomy and intraoperative parathyroid hormone monitoring. the first 36 cases and some pitfalls [^116Vj9k7]. Surgical Endoscopy (2002). Low credibility.

Background

The success of parathyroid surgery depends on the identification and removal of all hyperactive parathyroid tissue. At this writing, bilateral cervical exploration and identification of all parathyroid glands represent the operative standard for primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT). However, improved preoperative localization techniques and the availability of intraoperative parathyroid hormone monitoring prepare the way for minimally invasive procedures.

Methods

Patients with pHPT and one unequivocally enlarged parathyroid gland on preoperative ultrasound and 99mTc-SestaMIBI scintigraphy underwent minimally invasive video-assisted parathyroidectomy by an anterior approach. Intraoperatively, a rapid chemiluminescense immunoassay was used to measure intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) levels shortly before and then 5, 10, and 15 min after excision of the adenoma. The operation was considered successful when more than a 50% decrease in preexcision iPTH levels was observed after 5 min.

Results

Between October 1999 and November 2001, 36 of 82 patients with pHPT were eligible for a minimally invasive approach. A conversion to open surgery became necessary in five patients because of technical problems. In three cases, intraoperative iPTH monitoring showed no sufficient decrease in iPTH values. In these cases, subsequent cervical exploration showed one double adenoma and two hyperplasias, respectively. In two patients we had difficulty interpreting intraoperative iPTH values, resulting in persistent pHPT.

Conclusions

Despite the use of high-resolution ultrasound and 99mTc-SestaMIBI scintigraphy, the presence of multiple glandular disease cannot be ruled out completely. Intraoperative iPTH monitoring to ensure operative success is indispensible for a minimally invasive approach. Despite our problems with iPTH monitoring in two patients, we believe that in selected cases, minimally invasive parathyroidectomy represents an attractive alternative to conventional surgery.

### Comparison of intraoperative versus postoperative parathyroid hormone levels to predict hypocalcemia earlier after total thyroidectomy [^111LaY53]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine differences in the mean parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels for normocalcemic and hypocalcemic total thyroidectomy patients who were tested for PTH during the intraoperative or early postoperative period.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, the Cochrane Database, and other databases from 1960 to 2014 in the English language and specific to humans for relevant articles.

Review Methods

Studies were included if PTH was obtained within 24 hours of thyroidectomy. Studies were excluded (1) if only a hemithyroidectomy was performed, (2) if means of studied PTH values were not reported in the article, or (3) if the time of the PTH draw fell outside of defined "intraoperative" or "early postoperative" windows. PTH values were divided into 3 groups: preoperative (control group), intraoperative (ie, discharge decisions were based on PTH values drawn in the operating room), and early postoperative (ie, PTH values at 1 to 4 hours after surgery were used as a guide).

Results

The reported means of perioperative PTH levels and percentage of patients who developed hypocalcemia were collected from 14 studies. PTH evaluated at both the intraoperative and early postoperative periods was significantly lower in patients who became hypocalcemic versus patients who remained normocalcemic. There was no significant difference when PTH was measured intraoperatively or early postoperatively.

Conclusion

Intraoperative PTH has no significant disadvantage versus early postoperative PTH when used as a clinical guide for discharge after thyroidectomy.

### Surgical aspects of primary hyperparathyroidism [^116b6nbc]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Parathyroidectomy (PTX) is the treatment of choice for symptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT). It is also the treatment of choice in asymptomatic PHPT with evidence for target organ involvement. This review updates surgical aspects of PHPT and proposes the following definitions based on international expert consensus: selective PTX (and reasons for conversion to an extended procedure), bilateral neck exploration for non-localized or multigland disease, subtotal PTX, total PTX with immediate or delayed autotransplantation, and transcervical thymectomy and extended en bloc PTX for parathyroid carcinoma. The systematic literature reviews discussed covered (i) the use of intraoperative PTH (ioPTH) for localized single-gland disease and (ii) the management of low BMD after PTX. Updates based on prospective observational studies are presented concerning PTX for multigland disease and hereditary PHPT syndromes, histopathology, intraoperative adjuncts, localization techniques, perioperative management, "reoperative" surgery and volume/outcome data. Postoperative complications are few and uncommon (< 3%) in centers performing over 40 PTXs per year. This review is the first global consensus about surgery in PHPT and reflects the current practice in leading endocrine surgery units worldwide. © 2022 The Authors.

### Changing intraoperative parathyroid hormone collection sites from peripheral to central does not affect predictive accuracy during minimally invasive parathyroidectomy [^112iULtA]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Intraoperative parathyroid hormone (ioPTH) monitoring (IPM) is vital to minimally invasive parathyroidectomy. Techniques vary in assay sampling, potentially affecting predictive accuracy of operative success. Initial guidelines were established using peripheral sites, but central sites may be preferred or necessary when peripheral access is not feasible. We hypothesize that changing collection sites from preexcision peripheral sites to postexcision central sites would not affect IPM accuracy.

Methods

Analysis of 64 consecutive patients who underwent parathyroidectomy for primary hyperparathyroidism was undertaken. PTH assays were collected simultaneously from a peripheral vein (PV) and central vein (CV) preexcision and at a 10-min interval after initial parathyroid excision. IPM success was defined as PTH decrease ≥ 50% 10 min after initial excision. Predictive accuracy was determined by the need to resect another abnormal gland and biochemical normalization in the postoperative clinic. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) method with area under the curve (AUC) compared diagnostic accuracy of different assay approaches.

Results

Centrally, a statistically higher mean pre- and postexcision ioPTH of 391 pg/ml and 58 pg/ml was found compared with peripheral means of 156 pg/ml and 49 pg/ml, respectively (p < 0.001). The AUC when changing from a PV preexcision to a CV postexcision ioPTH was 0.89, comparable to AUC for peripheral or central assay collections alone (AUC = 0.83 and 0.85, respectively).

Conclusions

This study suggests that altering collection sites does not alter assay validity. In cases where peripheral sampling is compromised, changing from a peripheral to central sites will not likely alter the predictive accuracy of IPM significantly.

### Using ex vivo radioactivity measurement to differentiate parathyroid single-gland and multigland disease [^116eQJRV]. The Oncologist (2025). Medium credibility.

This study has several limitations, including those inherent to any retrospective studies. The threshold of RR ≥ 1.2 was intended to predict the likelihood of SGD versus MGD, but it does not predict an intraoperative cure. We still need to rely on the IoPTH monitoring. Nonetheless, using this simple RR threshold can help surgeons make quick intraoperative decisions and reducing OR time. Our current practice is to begin by exploring the superior and inferior parathyroid glands on the same side. If an abnormal parathyroid gland is found, we remove it. If the resected parathyroid gland has an RR ≥ 1.2, we will wait for IoPTH result to confirm intraoperative cure or explore the contralateral side. If RR is less than 1.2, we will send the IoPTH and start exploring the other side simultaneously while waiting for the IoPTH result to shorten the unnecessary wait time. Another limitation of this study is the inevitable selection bias resulting from its single-institutional nature. The predictive values of the study are affected by the incidence of SGD among the study cohorts. According to the American Association of Endocrine Surgeons guidelines, the overall prevalence of SGD is 67%-94%. In this study, the frequency of SGD was low, likely because of the referral pattern at a tertiary medical center. The PPV of using RR ≥ 1.2 as the threshold is expected to be different (likely higher) in a different patient population. Although our study results were validated on a different cohort of 115 patients, the external validity is best confirmed by a prospective multi-institutional study. Additionally, we excluded patients with persistent HPT following parathyroidectomy, which could introduce further selection bias. Lastly, radioguided parathyroidectomy is not a standard practice in all institutions, and purchasing equipment such as probes and monitors will incur additional costs. However, the initial investment will be quickly recouped through reduced unnecessary OR wait time.

### Will directed parathyroidectomy utilizing the gamma probe or intraoperative parathyroid hormone assay replace bilateral cervical exploration as the preferred operation for primary hyperparathyroidism? [^116zH91e]. World Journal of Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

The trend toward limited exploration for primary hyperparathyroidism (1 degrees HPT) has stemmed from advances in sestamibi scanning, gamma probe technology, and intraoperative parathyroid hormone monitoring (iPTH). Prior to widespread application, directed parathyroidectomy must be shown to meet the high standards of conventional cervical exploration. In this prospective, nonrandomized trial, results of parathyroidectomy utilizing the gamma probe, iPTH, or neither technique were evaluated. Altogether, 150 patients underwent parathyroidectomy utilizing the gamma probe (n = 50), iPTH (n = 50), or neither technique (n = 50). Each group was evaluated for operating time, length of hospitalization, cure rate, morbidity, mortality, and cost. A telephone survey was conducted with 25 patients in each group (n = 75) to address patient satisfaction. The gamma probe localized the abnormal gland in 66% of patients and confirmed cure intraoperatively in 84%. In the iPTH group, a more than 50% decrease from baseline occurred in 98%. The mean operating times were 76, 84, and 90 minutes, respectively (p = 0.16); and the mean length of hospitalization was 1 day. The biochemical cure rates were 98%, 100%, and 96%, respectively (p = 0.17). Total costs were $4476, $3918, and $3905, respectively. A total of 96% of patients in all three groups were "very satisfied" with their surgical procedure. Directed parathyroidectomy utilizing the gamma probe or iPTH assay does not significantly alter the operating time, length of hospitalization, cure rate, morbidity, mortality, or patient satisfaction when compared to conventional exploration in our practice. The probe is more expensive and was not a consistently reliable tool for localizing parathyroid pathology. PTH monitoring reliably predicts cure intraoperatively.

### Nuclear imaging and minimally invasive surgery in the management of hyperparathyroidism [^113GZWwP]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Primary hyperparathyroidism is the most common cause of hypercalcemia, and the treatment is primarily surgical. Because of biochemical screening, more patients now present with asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism, and consensus guidelines have been developed for the treatment of these patients. There is now considerable interest in minimally invasive approaches to the treatment of hyperparathyroidism. Sestamibi scanning as a localizing study, used in combination with anatomic imaging and intraoperative rapid parathyroid hormone assays, has enabled focused surgical approaches. Patients with localizing studies that indicate a single parathyroid adenoma are candidates for such approaches, including unilateral neck exploration, minimally invasive single-gland exploration, or endoscopic exploration instead of the traditional approach of bilateral neck exploration. Nuclear imaging is also critical to the successful management of patients with persistent or recurrent hyperparathyroidism.

### Investigating the effectiveness of intraoperative rapid parathyroid hormone assay in parathyroidectomy surgery in patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism [^114nyJWS]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2023). Medium credibility.

Variables and data sources

After explaining the study design and obtaining a written consent form from the patients, they were enrolled in the study. Five blood samples were taken from the patients. The first one was drawn after anesthesia induction and before the first incision of the skin. Then the second one was taken after a full exploration of parathyroid glands and before parathyroid resection. The two samples were considered as pre-excision samples for PTH assessment. In patients undergoing subtotal parathyroidectomy, approximately 50 mg of the most normal parathyroid gland was preserved, and the rest were excised completely. Then, the surgery was accomplished with upper thymectomy. Intraoperative neural monitoring was also performed to avoid nerve damage. 10 and 20 min after the excision of the parathyroid glands, two blood samples were taken from the patients. In cases undergoing total parathyroidectomy and upper thymectomy, all parathyroid glands with upper part of thymus were excised completely, and then blood samples were drawn 10 and 20 min after the excision. We waited for the frozen section and lab results of the patients. No tissue manipulation was performed during the 10 to 20 waiting period. When frozen sections confirmed the excision of parathyroid glands, 50–80 mg of apparently normal parathyroid tissue were auto-transplanted to the patients' subcutaneous pocket in the infra-clavicular area, as previously reported. If lab results indicated a more than 50% decline in serum PTH in post-excision samples compared to pre-excision samples, the intervention was assumed complete. If this endpoint was not achieved while the frozen section evaluation also doesn't confirm the total resection of four parathyroid glands, the surgery was assumed incomplete, and further search for ectopic and residual parathyroid gland(s) will be carried out, including exploration of the most common sites of ectopic parathyroid glands in patients with persistent HPT such as the paraesophageal and intrathyroidal regions. Twenty-four hours after the operation, a fifth blood sample was obtained from the patients to assess PTH levels. All patients receive 10 gr calcium gluconate daily intravenously and calcium carbonate and Rocaltrol. Serum Calcium levels were checked and corrected based on albumin levels every six hours for the patient to assess for life-threatening hypocalcemia, and proper therapeutic measures were taken. Six months after the surgery, the patients were evaluated with serum PTH and Calcium levels and physical examination. In cases of hypocalcemia, 1gr of intravenous calcium, Rocatrol and 6gr of oral calcium was administered similar to previous studies. Finally, all patients with calcium above 8 and only with oral calcium were discharged and were followed up in regular visits.
