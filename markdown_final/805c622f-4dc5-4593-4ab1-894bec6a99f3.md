## Question

Trazodone affect bp medication

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how trazodone affects blood pressure medication. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacology of trazodone and its hemodynamic effects. Then, I should verify the specific interaction with antihypertensives and whether it is pharmacodynamic or pharmacokinetic. Next, I will quantify the clinical risk and identify high-risk scenarios. After that, I should outline practical management strategies, including dose adjustments and monitoring. Finally, I will consider special populations and synthesize a concise clinical recommendation with supporting references.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacology and hemodynamic profile of trazodone. Trazodone is a serotonin antagonist and reuptake inhibitor with prominent alpha-1 adrenergic receptor antagonism, which predictably lowers vascular tone and can cause orthostatic hypotension and syncope, especially during initiation and dose titration [^a7a29af3] [^59fd6a5b].

> Wait, let me verify the nature of the interaction with antihypertensives. The FDA labeling repeatedly states that concomitant use of trazodone with antihypertensive therapy may require a reduction in the dose of the antihypertensive drug, indicating a pharmacodynamic additive hypotensive effect rather than a pharmacokinetic interaction with most BP medications [^59fd6a5b] [^7c0374c7] [^a86e4f4a].

> I should confirm the clinical magnitude and frequency. Orthostatic hypotension and syncope are established adverse effects of trazodone, with hypotension reported in roughly 7% of inpatients and 3.8% of outpatients in older trials, and syncope in about 2.8–4.5% depending on the population, underscoring a clinically meaningful risk when combined with BP-lowering agents [^7e0ad5bf] [^59fd6a5b].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I need to check which antihypertensive classes are most likely to amplify hypotension with trazodone. Alpha-1 blockers, direct vasodilators, and diuretics can compound orthostatic symptoms, and guideline tables explicitly list trazodone among drugs that can worsen orthostatic hypotension in hypertensive patients, reinforcing caution and the need for medication reconciliation in this context [^f3d1857d] [^ffad14d1].

> Next, I should review practical management. Let me think about dose strategies: start trazodone low, titrate slowly, and consider moving a portion of the antihypertensive dose to bedtime or reducing the antihypertensive dose if symptomatic hypotension emerges. Monitor for dizziness, falls, and syncope, and counsel on slow positional changes, especially in older adults or those on multidrug regimens [^59fd6a5b] [^f3d1857d].

> But wait, what if there are pharmacokinetic interactions that could indirectly affect BP control? I should double-check CYP3A4 considerations. Trazodone is a CYP3A4 substrate; strong CYP3A4 inhibitors like ritonavir can markedly increase trazodone exposure and worsen hypotension, while inducers like carbamazepine can lower trazodone levels and potentially blunt efficacy, so dose adjustments of trazodone (not the antihypertensive) are warranted in those scenarios [^294d792d] [^5389bc15] [^b839459d].

> I need to ensure I address special populations. In older adults, the risk of orthostatic hypotension and falls is higher, and trazodone is frequently involved in multidrug interactions. Therefore, extra caution, lower starting doses, and explicit fall-risk counseling are prudent, and deprescribing or substituting alternatives may be considered if hypotension limits function or safety [^c74ac5a7] [^9577e609] [^f3d1857d].

> Let me reconsider the overall clinical message. Trazodone's alpha-1 blockade adds to the blood pressure–lowering effect of antihypertensives, so the net effect is greater hypotension risk rather than hypertension. Clinically, this means symptomatic orthostasis, dizziness, and falls are the key concerns, and proactive dose management and monitoring are essential when combining trazodone with BP medications [^59fd6a5b] [^7c0374c7] [^a86e4f4a].

> In summary, I should confirm the bottom line: trazodone can potentiate the hypotensive effects of antihypertensive therapy, sometimes necessitating a reduction in the antihypertensive dose. Manage by starting low, going slow, monitoring for orthostatic symptoms, and adjusting either the antihypertensive or trazodone dose based on tolerability and CYP3A4 interactions, with heightened vigilance in older adults and those on polypharmacy [^59fd6a5b] [^7c0374c7] [^294d792d] [^f3d1857d].

Trazodone can cause **orthostatic hypotension** and syncope, especially when combined with antihypertensives, and may require **dose reduction** of the BP medication [^59fd6a5b] [^7c0374c7]. It does not directly interact with most BP drugs, but **additive hypotension** is common, particularly with alpha-blockers, diuretics, or calcium channel blockers [^f3d1857d]. Monitor for dizziness, falls, and fainting, especially in older adults or those on multiple agents; adjust therapy as needed and consider alternative antidepressants if hypotension persists [^f3d1857d].

---

## Pharmacological mechanisms influencing blood pressure

Trazodone affects BP primarily through **alpha-1 adrenergic antagonism**, which causes vasodilation and orthostatic hypotension [^a7a29af3]. It also has serotonergic effects that can modulate autonomic tone, though this is less directly tied to BP changes.

---

## Clinical evidence of blood pressure effects

- **Orthostatic hypotension**: Commonly reported with trazodone, especially when combined with antihypertensives [^59fd6a5b] [^7c0374c7].
- **Syncope**: Documented in clinical trials and postmarketing reports, particularly with concomitant antihypertensives [^59fd6a5b] [^7c0374c7].
- **Dose-related effects**: Higher trazodone doses increase hypotension risk, especially with BP-lowering drugs [^notfound].

---

## Specific interactions with antihypertensive medications

| **Antihypertensive class** | **Interaction with trazodone** | **Clinical implications** |
|-|-|-|
| Alpha-blockers (e.g. doxazosin) | Additive hypotension | Increased orthostatic symptoms; dose reduction may be needed [^f3d1857d] |
| Beta-blockers (e.g. metoprolol) | Potential additive hypotension | Monitor for dizziness and syncope; adjust dose if needed [^59fd6a5b] |
| Calcium channel blockers (e.g. amlodipine) | Additive vasodilation | Enhanced hypotension; monitor closely [^59fd6a5b] |
| Diuretics (e.g. hydrochlorothiazide) | Volume depletion + orthostasis | Higher syncope risk; consider dose changes [^f3d1857d] |
| ACE inhibitors/ARBs | Mild additive hypotension | Generally manageable; monitor for symptoms [^59fd6a5b] |

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

- **Dose adjustment**: FDA labeling advises that concomitant antihypertensives may require BP medication dose reduction when trazodone is added [^59fd6a5b] [^7c0374c7].
- **Monitoring**: Regularly assess for orthostatic symptoms, falls, and syncope, especially in older adults or those on multiple agents [^f3d1857d].
- **Alternative agents**: Consider antidepressants with less hypotension risk (e.g. SSRIs) if orthostatic symptoms persist [^0f83e529].

---

## Patient populations at increased risk

- **Elderly patients**: Higher risk of orthostatic hypotension and falls [^f3d1857d].
- **Polypharmacy**: Multiple BP agents amplify hypotension risk [^f3d1857d].
- **Cardiovascular disease**: Preexisting disease increases susceptibility to hypotension and arrhythmias [^59fd6a5b].

---

## Clinical management strategies

- **Start low, go slow**: Begin trazodone at low doses and titrate cautiously [^a7a29af3].
- **Patient education**: Counsel on slow position changes and hydration [^notfound].
- **Monitoring**: Check orthostatic vitals at each visit during initiation and titration [^notfound].
- **Dose modification**: Reduce antihypertensive dose if symptomatic hypotension occurs [^59fd6a5b].

---

## Summary of key findings

Trazodone can cause **orthostatic hypotension** and syncope, especially with antihypertensives, and may necessitate **BP medication dose reduction** [^59fd6a5b]. No direct pharmacokinetic interactions are known, but **additive hypotension** is common; monitor closely and adjust therapy as needed [^7c0374c7].

General

The possibility of suicide in seriously depressed patients is inherent in the illness and may persist until significant remission occurs. Therefore, prescriptions should be written for the smallest number of tablets consistent with good patient management.

Hypotension, including orthostatic hypotension and syncope, has been reported to occur in patients receiving trazodone HCl. Concomitant administration of antihypertensive therapy with trazodone HCl may require a reduction in the dose of the antihypertensive drug.

Little is known about the interaction between trazodone HCl and general anesthetics; therefore, prior to elective surgery, trazodone HCl should be discontinued for as long as clinically feasible.

As with all antidepressants, the use of trazodone HCl should be based on the consideration of the physician that the expected benefits of therapy outweigh potential risk factors.

Information for Patients

Prescribers or other health professionals should inform patients, their families, and their caregivers about the benefits and risks associated with treatment with trazodone HCl and should counsel them in its appropriate use. A patient Medication Guide about "Antidepressant Medicines, Depression and other Serious Mental Illness, and Suicidal Thoughts or Actions" is available for trazodone HCl. The prescriber or health professional should instruct patients, their families, and their caregivers to read the Medication Guide and should assist them in understanding its contents. Patients should be given the opportunity to discuss the contents of the Medication Guide and to obtain answers to any questions they may have. The complete text of the Medication Guide is reprinted at the end of this document.

Patients should be advised of the following issues and asked to alert their prescriber if these occur while taking trazodone HCl.

5.3 Cardiac Arrhythmias

Clinical studies indicate that trazodone hydrochloride may be arrhythmogenic in patients with preexisting cardiac disease. Arrhythmias identified include isolated PVCs, ventricular couplets, tachycardia with syncope, and torsade de pointes. Postmarketing events, including torsade de pointes have been reported at doses of 100 mg or less with the immediate-release form of trazodone. Trazodone should also be avoided in patients with a history of cardiac arrhythmias, as well as other circumstances that may increase the risk of the occurrence of torsade de pointes and/or sudden death, including symptomatic bradycardia, hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia, and the presence of congenital prolongation of the QT interval. Trazodone is not recommended for use during the initial recovery phase of myocardial infarction. Caution should be used when administering trazodone to patients with cardiac disease and such patients should be closely monitored, since antidepressant drugs (including trazodone) may cause cardiac arrhythmias [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

Trazodone prolongs the QT/QTc interval. The use of trazodone should be avoided in patients with known QT prolongation or in combination with other drugs that are inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., itraconazole, clarithromycin, voriconazole), or known to prolong QT interval including Class 1A antiarrhythmics (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class 3 antiarrhythmics (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol), certain antipsychotic medications (e.g., ziprasidone, chlorpromazine, thioridazine), and certain antibiotics (e.g., gatifloxacin). Concomitant administration of drugs may increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmia [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

5.4 Orthostatic Hypotension and Syncope

Hypotension, including orthostatic hypotension and syncope has been reported in patients receiving trazodone hydrochloride. Concomitant use with an antihypertensive may require a reduction in the dose of the antihypertensive drug.

5.4 Orthostatic Hypotension and Syncope

Hypotension, including orthostatic hypotension and syncope has been reported in patients receiving trazodone hydrochloride. Concomitant use with an antihypertensive may require a reduction in the dose of the antihypertensive drug.

5.5 Increased Risk of Bleeding

Drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake inhibition, including trazodone, increase the risk of bleeding events. Concomitant use of aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), other antiplatelet drugs, warfarin, and other anticoagulants may add to this risk. Case reports and epidemiological studies (case-control and cohort design) have demonstrated an association between use of drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and the occurrence of gastrointestinal bleeding. Bleeding events related to drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake have ranged from ecchymosis, hematoma, epistaxis, and petechiae to life-threatening hemorrhages.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

Because the frequency of adverse drug effects is affected by diverse factors (e.g., drug dose, method of detection, physician judgment, disease under treatment, etc.) a single meaningful estimate of adverse event incidence is difficult to obtain. This problem is illustrated by the variation in adverse event incidence observed and reported from the inpatients and outpatients treated with trazodone HCl. It is impossible to determine precisely what accounts for the differences observed.

Clinical Trial Reports

Table 2 below is presented solely to indicate the relative frequency of adverse events reported in representative controlled clinical studies conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of trazodone HCl.

The figures cited cannot be used to predict precisely the incidence of untoward events in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors often differ from those which prevailed in clinical trials. These incidence figures, also, cannot be compared with those obtained from other clinical studies involving related drug products and placebo as each group of drug trials is conducted under a different set of conditions.

### What is the impact of antidepressant side effects on medication adherence among adult patients diagnosed with depressive disorder: a systematic review [^b5a04f88]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Adherence is a core component of medical treatment and can be defined as compliance with the guidelines provided by the physician regarding the taking of medicines. Medication adherence (MA) has been proven to be a prerequisite to achieving beneficial treatment outcomes, and failure to comply with medication regimes has been associated with negative consequences, not only on an individual level by jeopardising patients' health but also on the wider community level, amplifying the healthcare costs caused by disease reoccurrence.

Research has demonstrated suboptimal levels of adherence to medication in various chronic conditions such as hypertension and HIV as well as in several mental health conditions such as schizophrenia and depression. Specifically, in major depressive disorder (MDD), the dropout rates (rates of patients failing to complete their medication regimens) fluctuate from 10% to 60%, raising concern for poor treatment outcomes and subsequent increase in hospitalisation and emergency visits rates.

MDD as a disabling condition puts a significant burden on public health systems worldwide, affecting patients' quality of life by aggravating morbidity and mortality levels, and increasing the need for healthcare services. Several studies suggest that MDD prevalence rates remain stable with societal and demographic factors influencing fluctuations in different geographical locations. Yet, others argue that it is expected to be one of the leading causes of illness by the end of the decade. MDD symptoms have been proven to decrease with the pharmacological treatment of antidepressant medication, resulting in better health outcomes and decreased mortality.

Antidepressants (ADs) are a core part of the treatment procedure for moderate or severe depression based on the NHS guidelines, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence and are further corroborated by the literature. The pharmacological treatment with antidepressants can be divided into two phases: the initiation/acute phase (6–12 weeks) and the continuation phase (4–9 months). Several types of antidepressants can be clustered in groups: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as fluoxetine, serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) such as venlafaxine, noradrenaline and specific serotonergic antidepressants such as mirtazapine, tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) such as amitriptyline, serotonin antagonists and reuptake inhibitors such as trazodone and monoamine oxidase inhibitors such as phenelzine.

7. Drug Interactions

MAOIs

MAOIs should not be used within 14 days of trazodone [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)].

Central Nervous System (CNS) Depressants

Trazodone may enhance the response to alcohol, barbiturates, and other CNS depressants.

Cytochrome P450 3A4 Inhibitors

In vitro drug metabolism studies suggest that there is a potential for drug interactions when trazodone is given with cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) inhibitors. The effect of short-term administration of ritonavir (200 mg twice daily, 4 doses) on the pharmacokinetics of a single dose of trazodone (50 mg) has been studied in 10 healthy subjects. The Cmax of trazodone increased by 34%, the AUC increased 2.4 fold, the half-life increased by 2.2 fold, and the clearance decreased by 52%. Adverse effects including nausea, hypotension, and syncope were observed when ritonavir and trazodone were coadministered. It is likely that ketoconazole, indinavir, and other CYP3A4 inhibitors such as itraconazole may lead to substantial increases in trazodone plasma concentrations with the potential for adverse effects. If trazodone is used with a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, the risk of cardiac arrhythmia may be increased [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] and a lower dose of trazodone should be considered.

### Real-world characteristics and treatment patterns of patients with insomnia prescribed trazodone in the United States [^3e3428f8]. Clinical Therapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

This study sought to describe patient characteristics and treatment patterns among patients with insomnia prescribed trazodone in the United States.

Methods

This real-world, retrospective, descriptive cohort study used US commercial insurance claims from July 1, 2009, through June 30, 2019. The index date was the first prescription for trazodone between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2018, with 6 months for the preindex period and ≥ 6 months for the postindex period.

Findings

Among 5.8 million patients with insomnia, 17.7% were prescribed trazodone, and 357,380 adults (6.2%) and 7564 children (0.1%) met the study eligibility criteria. The mean (SD) age was 48.8 (15.8) years for adults and 14.8 (2.7) years for pediatrics. Most patients were female (229,280 adults [64.2%] and 4481 children [59.2%]). Insomnia due to mental disorder was the most common specific diagnosis. The most common (> 25%) comorbid conditions were anxiety, depression, and hypertensive disease, and 1 of 10 had a history of substance abuse. Zolpidem was previously prescribed (73,342 adults [20.5%] and 233 children [3.1%]) and continued to be prescribed. Concomitant antidepressants were most common (216,893 adults [60.7%] and 5414 children [71.6%]), but benzodiazepines (132,740 adults [37.1%] and 1188 children [15.7%]), antiepileptics (115,064 adults [32.2%] and 2103 children [27.8%]), nonbenzodiazepines (90,946 adults [25.4%] and 542 children [7.2%]), and antipsychotics (40,490 adults [11.3%] and 2063 children [27.3%]) were also prescribed.

Implications

This study provides current evidence that trazodone use is widespread among patients with insomnia and is often associated with other specific comorbidities, such as psychiatric conditions. A deeper knowledge of the real-world management of patients with insomnia may facilitate steps toward improving sleep quality, daytime functioning, and clinical outcomes for patients.

### Does trazodone have a role in palliating symptoms? [^ec41abca]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2007). Low credibility.

Introduction

Trazodone is a unique antidepressant, which blocks the postsynaptic serotonin (5-HT) receptors, 5-HT(2A) and 5-HT(2C), and weakly inhibits presynaptic 5-HT transporters.

Discussion

Trazodone is well-absorbed by the mouth and is metabolized by three cytochromes: CYP1A2, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4. Clinical benefits include reduced insomnia in those depressed and/or on antidepressants. Pain may be relieved by mechanisms similar to venlafaxine. Delirium unresponsive to neuroleptics has been reported to respond to trazodone. Drug interactions are a risk due to cytochrome metabolism.

Conclusion

Trazodone has a unique pharmacology, which may be an advantage in palliating symptoms; however, little evidence is available through cohort or randomized trials to give guidance to its use.

### 2025 AHA / ACC / AANP / AAPA / ABC / ACCP / ACPM / AGS / AMA / ASPC / NMA / PCNA / SGIM guideline for the prevention, detection, evaluation and management of high blood pressure in adults: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^189a94f3]. Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Secondary hypertension — drug-associated blood pressure increases emphasize medication/substance review and management: A careful history should be taken with close attention paid to prescription medications and over-the-counter substances, illicit drugs, and herbal products, and a change in BP may also result from drug-drug or drug-food interactions; when feasible, drugs associated with increased BP should be reduced or discontinued and alternative agents used.

### Treatment of depression in patients with concomitant cardiac disease [^0f83e529]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Depressed patients are at increased risk of cardiovascular (CV) disease (CVD) and those with concomitant depression and CVD are at increased risk of death. The safety and efficacy of antidepressants in patients with CVD varies greatly between the agent used and type of disease. This review will summarize the CV adverse effect and drug interaction profile of antidepressants and discuss the use of antidepressants in CVD patients. We searched MEDLINE, PubMed, CINAHL, Web of Science, PsycINFO, and The Cochrane Library from inception to June 2014 to identify studies relevant to antidepressant use in patients with CVD. Primary references from the identified articles were also evaluated for inclusion. Descriptive analysis was performed for the included studies in this review. Orthostatic hypotension was more common with tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), trazodone and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). Hypertension can be significant with serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) and MAOIs. The potential for QT prolongation is present with TCAs, certain selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), certain SNRIs and mirtazapine. Due to its low risk of drug-drug interactions, adverse effect profile and potential for beneficial antiplatelet activity, sertraline could be considered the choice antidepressant for patients with ischemic heart disease. SSRIs and potentially SNRIs are relatively safe and effective options for patients with heart failure. In patients at high risk for ventricular arrhythmias, bupropion has the overall lowest risk for QT prolongation. TCAs and MAOIs should be avoided in patients with concomitant CVD. In conclusion, due to the increased morbidity and mortality associated with comorbid CVD and depression, practitioners should readily assess and initiate management of depression in such patients. The choice of antidepressant should take into account the potential CV impact of the various agents balancing safety and efficacy.

### Trazodone improves obstructive sleep apnea after ischemic stroke: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover pilot study [^243315ec]. Journal of Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Low arousal threshold plays a part in the pathogenesis of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and may be improved by sedatives. Sedative antidepressants are frequently prescribed for stroke patients due to their high prevalence of insomnia and depression. However, the effect of sedative antidepressants on the severity of OSA in stroke patients has not been studied well.

Methods

In a double-blinded randomized crossover pilot study, 22 post-acute ischemic stroke patients (mean age, 61.7 ± 10.6 y) with OSA received 100 mg of trazodone or a placebo just before polysomnography, with approximately 1 week between measures. The study also measured baseline heart rate variability and 24-h ambulatory blood pressure.

Results

Administration of trazodone significantly increased the percentage time of slow-wave sleep (31.5 ± 13.2 vs. 18.4 ± 8.7%; P < 0.001) and improved almost all the parameters of OSA severity, including the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI, 25.4 ± 15.4 vs. 39.1 ± 18.4 events/h; P < 0.001), the respiratory arousal index (9.8 (5.8–11.95) vs. 14.1 (11.3–18.7) events/h; P < 0.001), and the minimum oxygen saturation (80.2 ± 9.1 vs. 77.1 ± 9.6%; P = 0.016). Responders to therapy (AHI reduced by > 50%; n = 7/22) had predominant OSA during rapid-eye-movement sleep and decreased sympathetic tone, as reflected in significantly lower mean blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and normalized low-frequency power.

Conclusions

Obstructive sleep apnea with comorbid ischemic stroke may be a distinctive phenotype which responds quite well to trazodone, decreasing OSA severity without increasing nocturnal hypoxia.

### Increased odds of metabolic syndrome among adults with depressive symptoms or antidepressant use [^bd5c8fc4]. Translational Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

Our study found that participants on TCAs have significantly higher odds of MetS compared to participants with no antidepressant use. TCA use has multiple side effects, such as HTN through peripheral α1 adrenergic receptor agonism. TCAs also have antihistaminergic effects that may result in weight gain and subsequent dyslipidemia. Finally, TCAs decrease the basal metabolic rate and cause increased appetite and carbohydrate craving, which are associated with T2DM and possible insulin resistance. However, it is important to interpret this result cautiously. The number of participants taking TCAs was relatively small, which may limit the generalizability of these findings. Moreover, TCAs are typically prescribed for patients with more severe depression, which itself is associated with increased metabolic risk. However, it should be noted that TCAs are typically non-first-line treatments for depression and have indications beyond depression, including chronic pain syndromes, such as migraine and fibromyalgia, as well as obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), which also have positive associations with MetS and CVD. These potential comorbidities may confound the relationship between TCA use and MetS, as patients with these conditions could be predisposed to higher metabolic risk regardless of TCA use. Future research with a larger sample of TCA users and detailed data on comorbid conditions could help clarify the specific contribution of TCAs to MetS risk.

This specific study aimed to compare the odds of MetS in each antidepressant class relative to individuals not using antidepressants. The insignificant results pertaining to SSRI, SNRI, and atypical antidepressant use may be due to inconsistent metabolic effects within these antidepressant classes compared to the no-antidepressant group. For example, SSRIs can cause weight gain and increased waist circumference, increased serum TG levels, higher low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), abnormal glucose tolerance, and insulin resistance. Randomized clinical trials have reported minimal effects of bupropion, mirtazapine, nefazodone, and trazodone on BP. Bupropion, nefazodone, and trazodone are often considered 'weight neutral' and a growing body of evidence suggests that bupropion may promote weight loss. Moreover, these medications do not have clinically significant impacts on lipid and glucose metabolism.

### Drug-drug interactions involving classic psychedelics: a systematic review [^d070c90b]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2024). Medium credibility.

Serotonin 2A receptor antagonists

Classic psychedelics are known to bind to 5-HT 2A receptors where it is thought that their hallucinogenic properties are mediated. The results of multiple studies on drugs that are 5-HT 2A receptor antagonists, such as ketanserin, trazodone, risperidone and chlorpromazine, indicated that they were all effective in attenuating the effects of LSD and psilocybin. Specifically, ketanserin, a 5-HT 2A antagonist with a strong affinity was found in all studies to either fully block or reduce the subjective effects of LSD and psilocybin. Similarly, decreased physical effects were also observed, including lowered blood pressure, body temperature and heart rate. Similarly, risperidone, a 5-HT 2A but also D 2 antagonist was found to attenuate the effects of psilocybin in a dose-dependent manner. Trazodone, another 5-HT 2A antagonist, was shown to reduce the psychological and hallucinogenic effects of LSD in one case report.

The findings from studies using chlorpromazine, which is also a 5-HT 2A receptor antagonist but has an affinity for D 2 and adrenoceptor α 1A and α 1B subtypes as well, are inconsistent. While two studies found that chlorpromazine reduced the intensity of LSD-induced effects as well as anxiety, another two independent studies reported the opposite. In addition, whilereported that oral pre-administration of chlorpromazine blocked the effects of LSD and not post-administration, thenobserved enhanced effects regardless of whether it was administered before or after LSD intake. However, the inconsistent findings regarding the effects of chlorpromazine on LSD response may be due to differences in study design, dosing regimens and individual variability. Moreover, chlorpromazine was reported to attenuate the effects of psilocybin and mescaline, where its pretreatment significantly decreased psilocybin-induced visual perception distortion and abolished the increased anxiety observed in schizophrenic patients following mescaline ingestion. Overall, considering the available evidence, treatment with potent 5-HT 2A antagonists, including medicines, is anticipated to diminish the effects of psychedelics (e.g. antipsychotics risperidone, olanzapine and pipamperone, antidepressants mirtazapine, mianserin and etoperidone as well as migraine prevention drug pizotifen).

### Acetaminophen and codeine phosphate (Tylenol with codeine) [^e1878f4d]. FDA (2019). Medium credibility.

Benzodiazepines and Other Central Nervous System (CNS) Depressants

Due to additive pharmacologic effect, the concomitant use of benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants, including alcohol, other sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics and other opioids, can increase the risk of hypotension, respiratory depression, profound sedation, coma, and death.

Reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. Follow patients closely for signs of respiratory depression and sedation (see WARNINGS).

Serotonergic Drugs

The concomitant use of opioids with other drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter system has resulted in serotonin syndrome. Examples of these drugs include, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), triptans, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, drugs that effect the serotonin neurotransmitter system (e.g., mirtazapine, trazodone, tramadol), and monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (used to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue) (see PRECAUTIONS; Information for Patients/Caregivers).

If concomitant use is warranted, carefully observe the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dose adjustment. Discontinue TYLENOL®with Codeine tablets immediately if serotonin syndrome is suspected.

Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs)

The concomitant use of opioids and MAOIs, such as phenelzine, tranylcypromine, linezolid, may manifest as serotonin syndrome or opioid toxicity.

Advise patients taking TYLENOL®with Codeine tablets not to use MAOIs or within 14 days of stopping such treatment. If urgent use of an opioid is necessary, use test doses and frequent titration of small doses of other opioids (such as oxycodone, hydrocodone, oxymorphone, hydrocodone, or buprenorphine) to treat pain while closely monitoring blood pressure and signs and symptoms of CNS and respiratory depression.

Mixed Agonist/Antagonist and Partial Agonist Opioid Analgesics

The concomitant use of opioids with other opioid analgesics, such as butorphanol, nalbuphine, pentazocine, may reduce the analgesic effect of TYLENOL®with Codeine tablets and/or precipitate withdrawal symptoms.

Advise patient to avoid concomitant use of these drugs.

### Orthostatic hypotension in the hypertensive patient [^f3d1857d]. American Journal of Hypertension (2018). Low credibility.

Orthostatic hypotension (OH) is an important and common medical problem, particularly in the frail elderly with multiple comorbidities and polypharmacy. OH is an independent risk factor for falls and overall mortality. Hypertension is among the most common comorbidities associated with OH, and its presence complicates the management of these patients because treatment of one can worsen the other. However, there is evidence that uncontrolled hypertension worsens OH so that both should be managed. The limited data available suggest that angiotensin receptor blockers and calcium channel blockers are preferable antihypertensives for these patients. Patients with isolated supine hypertension can be treated with bedtime doses of short-acting antihypertensives. Treatment of OH in the hypertensive patients should focus foremost on the removal of drugs that can worsen OH, including ones that are easily overlooked, such as tamsulosin, tizanidine, sildenafil, trazodone, and carvedilol. OH and postprandial hypotension can be prevented with abdominal binders and acarbose, respectively, without the need to increase baseline blood pressure. Upright blood pressure can be improved by harnessing residual sympathetic tone with atomoxetine, which blocks norepinephrine reuptake in nerve terminals, and pyridostigmine, which facilitates cholinergic neurotransmission in autonomic ganglia. Oral water bolus acutely but transiently increases blood pressure in autonomic failure patients. If traditional pressor agents are needed, midodrine and droxidopa can be used, administered at the lowest dose and frequency that improves symptoms. Management of OH in the hypertensive patient is challenging, but a management strategy based on understanding the underlying pathophysiology can be effective in most patients.

### Treatment of Alzheimer's disease: trazodone, sleep, serotonin, norepinephrine, and future directions [^a7a29af3]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2019). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL EXPERIENCE IN TRAZODONE PRESCRIPTION

Trazodone has been in use in the US since 1981, so there is a great deal known about its benefits and side-effects. Trazodone antagonizes alpha 1-adrenergic receptors, a property which may be associated with postural hypotension. Trazodone also causes sedation and can cause uncomfortable feelings. Trazodone is predominantly metabolized in liver microsomes, so patients with liver damage are more sensitive to this medication and should have lower doses prescribed. The half-life of trazodone is 3 to 5 hours. Because of the individual variability of potency and side-effects, dosing must be done carefully for each patient (start low: 12.5 mg at bedtime; go slow: 12.5 mg increments).

Trazodone has minimal effects on muscarinic cholinergic receptors, in contrast to older anti-depressant medications. Trazodone produces a higher quality of sleep for those patients who work with the dosing than the GABA agonists (e.g. benzodiazepines), anti-cholinergics, or anti-histamines (e.g. diphenhydramine), which are widely used but impair cognitive function short-term and are now being considered as contributors to the development of dementia and AD pathology long-term.

Trazodone has a generally positive effect on sexual desire and male erectile function, but it is also known to cause priapism, an emergency condition, similar to what can be associated with medications used to treat erectile dysfunction. It is estimated that abnormal erectile function occurs in about one in 6,000 male, mostly younger, patients treated with trazodone.

Trazodone is also useful for agitation. (There are anecdotes that 12.5 mg under the tongue decreases road-rage.).

Trazodone is relatively safer than most other anti-depressants in overdose situations. Fatalities are rare, and uneventful recoveries have been reported after ingestion of doses as high as 6,000–9,200 mg.

Trazodone may also be effective as a treatment for obstructive sleep apnea with worsening hypoxemia, which could also be beneficial for cognition and AD prevention. This effect could be related to serotonin, norepinephrine, or histamine mechanisms.

Pharmacokinetics

Absorption

In humans, trazodone is well absorbed after oral administration without selective localization in any tissue. When trazodone is taken shortly after ingestion of food, there may be an increase in the amount of drug absorbed, a decrease in maximum concentration and a lengthening in the time to maximum concentration. Peak plasma levels occur approximately one hour after dosing when trazodone is taken on an empty stomach or two hours after dosing when taken with food.

Metabolism

In vitro studies in human liver microsomes show that trazodone is metabolized to an active metabolite, m-chlorophenylpiperazine (mCPP) by cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4). Other metabolic pathways that may be involved in metabolism of trazodone have not been well characterized.

Elimination

In some patients trazodone may accumulate in the plasma.

Drug-Drug Interactions

See also PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions. In vitro drug metabolism studies reveal that trazodone is a substrate of the cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) enzyme and trazodone metabolism can be inhibited by the CYP3A4 inhibitors ketoconazole, ritonavir, and indinavir. The effect of short-term administration of ritonavir (200 mg twice daily, 4 doses) on the pharmacokinetics of a single dose of trazodone (50 mg) has been studied in 10 healthy subjects. The Cmax of trazodone increased by 34%, the AUC increased 2.4-fold, the half-life increased by 2.2-fold, and the clearance decreased by 52%. Adverse effects including nausea, hypotension, and syncope were observed when ritonavir and trazodone were co-administered.

Carbamazepine induces CYP34A. Following co-administration of carbamazepine 400 mg/day with trazodone 100 mg to 300 mg daily, carbamazepine reduced plasma concentrations of trazodone (as well as mCPP) by 76 and 60%, respectively, compared to pre-carbamazepine values.

For those patients who responded to trazodone HCl, one-third of the inpatients and one-half of the outpatients had a significant therapeutic response by the end of the first week of treatment. Three-fourths of all responders demonstrated a significant therapeutic effect by the end of the second week. One-fourth of responders required 2–4 weeks for a significant therapeutic response.

### Management of depression… [^7d01648a]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

To the Editor We read with great interest the review "Management of Depression in Adults" by Drs Simon and colleagues. 1 We appreciated the comprehensive view of the patient, the attention paid to nonpharmacological treatment, and the thinking process guiding the choice of the antidepressants. However, we could not find trazodone among the antidepressants. Possibly, the search criteria accounted for this gap. Nevertheless, trazodone is a US Food and Drug Administration –approved antidepressant and, at low doses, is also used to treat sleep disorders and anxiety as well as behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia. 2 Treatment effects occur through a complex central mechanism of action: trazodone. increases noradrenaline release and turnover through a 2-presynaptic receptor and is a 5-hydroxytryptamine 2 antagonist and serotonin reuptake inhibitor, with moderate histamine-1 receptor antagonism properties.

3 Trazodone is primarily an antidepressant at dosages up to 300 mg daily. Trazodone has no anticholinergic effects, neither causes nor worsens parkinsonism, and does not affect the libido. However, hypotension and dizziness are not uncommon adverse effects. 4 Trazodone serum levels may vary depending upon genetic P-glycoprotein polymorphisms, but trazodone does not affect liver cytochromes and thus does not have many drug interactions. 5 The lack of drug interactions and the high prevalence of sleep problems and anxiety in elderly patients make trazodone a potentially useful antidepressant in geriatric medicine. 4 Thus, we think that a review on the treatment of depression should include trazodone to provide the readers of JAMA with complete information on the available pharmacological choices.

There are no long-term cardiovascular outcome data; an FDA-mandated trial showed no significant increase in events at planned interim analyses but was terminated early after confidential results at the 25% interim analysis, and a subsequent trial was terminated early for poor recruitment and inadequate power, so long-term cardiovascular safety remains unclear. Patients should be observed for neuropsychiatric adverse effects, including suicidal thoughts and behaviors, especially in individuals younger than 24 years, and patients and families should be counseled for these reactions.

Secondary causes — medication related: Over-the-counter drugs, prescription medications, alternative therapies, dietary products, and recreational drugs can increase blood pressure (BP); common prescription culprits include oral contraceptives, central nervous system stimulants, and corticosteroids. Over-the-counter decongestants such as pseudoephedrine and phenylpropanolamine may cause a mild increase in BP with recommended dosing, but severe hypertension (HTN) has been observed as an idiosyncratic response with appropriate or excessive doses. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may antagonize the BP-lowering effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors without affecting BP in those without HTN. Recreational drugs linked with HTN include stimulants (cocaine and amphetamine derivatives) and anabolic steroids. When a child has elevated BP measurements, the practitioner should inquire about the intake of pharmacologic agents.

### Trazodone hydrochloride [^ad04f228]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Inform patients about the risk of bleeding associated with the concomitant use of trazodone and antiplatelet agents or anticoagulants. For patients taking warfarin, carefully monitor coagulation indices when initiating, titrating, or discontinuing trazodone.

5.6 Priapism

Cases of priapism (painful erections greater than 6 hours in duration) have been reported in men receiving trazodone. Priapism, if not treated promptly, can result in irreversible damage to the erectile tissue. Men who have an erection lasting greater than 4 hours, whether painful or not, should immediately discontinue the drug and seek emergency medical attention [see Adverse Reactions (6.2), Overdosage (10)].

Trazodone should be used with caution in men who have conditions that might predispose them to priapism (e.g., sickle cell anemia, multiple myeloma, or leukemia), or in men with anatomical deformation of the penis (e.g., angulation, cavernosal fibrosis, or Peyronie's disease).

5.7 Activation of Mania or Hypomania

In patients with bipolar disorder, treating a depressive episode with trazodone or another antidepressant may precipitate a mixed/manic episode. Activation of mania/hypomania has been reported in a small proportion of patients with major affective disorder who were treated with antidepressants. Prior to initiating treatment with trazodone, screen patients for any personal or family history of bipolar disorder, mania, or hypomania [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

### Could ketamine be the answer to treating treatment-resistant major depressive disorder? [^3c0521ea]. General Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

Drug–drug interactions

Certain types of drugs should not be used concomitantly with any form of ketamine. Some of these drugs can interfere with the first-pass metabolism in case of being used with oral or intravenous ketamine, others may cause cardiovascular problems especially in individuals with cardiovascular diseases. Such drugs include benzodiazepines, antipsychotics, opioids and alcohol which may all cause sedation. Blood pressure and heart monitoring should be measured in case of using drugs like MAOIs, TCAs, SSRIs, modafinil, armodafinil and amphetamine types of drugs. Clonidine can be used safely with esketamine as it can reduce esketamine's ability to cause hypertension and other side effects. Midazolam reduces the sympathomimetic effects of ketamine. Certain CYP(Cytochrome P450) enzyme inducers like rifampicin can reduce the concentration of esketamine and norketamine by 10% and 50%, respectively. Coadministration of ketamine and ticlopidine has been proven to increase the maximum plasma concentration of ketamine by 72% and total hepatic clearance by 15.5%.

### Use of antidepressant medications in relation to the incidence of breast cancer [^55f24180]. British Journal of Cancer (2006). Low credibility.

Atypical antidepressants have not shown an increased risk in this or other studies. Trazodone was a commonly used antidepressant in our study population, but the number of women reporting use of atypical antidepressants has been quite low in other studies. Some studies relying on self-report may underestimate trazodone use if other indications of antidepressant use (such as insomnia) are not assessed.

The one other study that evaluated whether the risk associated with antidepressant use varies by ER status reported associations of antidepressant use with ER− tumors and with PR− tumors. The strongest association was observed with SSRIs in ER+/PR− cases (OR = 2.0, 95% CI 1.1–3.8). We did not find an association between SSRIs, tricyclics, or antidepressant use overall with either ER+ or ER− breast cancers. In contrast to the earlier study, when we examined ER/PR combinations, risks were not elevated for ER+/PR− cases (data not shown).

Recently, one study reported that antidepressant users had a lower risk of breast cancer among women with a family history of breast cancer and a higher risk in those without a family history. Our results do not replicate this interaction (data not shown).

Much of the prior research examining antidepressants and breast cancer risk has relied on the self-reported use of antidepressants, but recall of prescription drugs varies according to the type of drug, the frequency of use, time since medication use, and education level. Compared to pharmacy data, antidepressant use is substantially under-reported. A study comparing self-reported use of antihypertensives, statins, and antidepressants with pharmacy data found higher agreement for antihypertensives and statins than for antidepressant medications. Antidepressant use was recalled only 62% of the time within 6 months prior to reference date, compared to 94% for antihypertensive use. In addition, recall of names and dose of medication is relatively low and the percentage missing timing of use is relatively high.

### Blood pressure-elevating and antihypertensive medication prescription trends [^23ea536c]. Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

NOVELTY AND RELEVANCE

Hypertension, or high blood pressure (BP), is a major modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular diseases including heart disease and stroke, which are among the leading causes of death in the United States. Hypertension is a chronic medical condition that affects a significant portion of the US population. According to 2017 to 2020 estimates, nearly 48.1% of US adults have hypertension, of which 77.5% have uncontrolled hypertension (BP ≥ 130/80 mm Hg). Hypertension control is critically important as it is significantly associated with lower risks of premature heart disease mortality, and major acute cardiovascular events including myocardial infarction and stroke.

One of the less investigated barriers to hypertension control is the use of medications that can raise BP levels. According to the 2017 American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association Guideline, certain prescription medications, such as amphetamines, antidepressants, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, immunosuppressants, and combined oral contraceptives, can raise BP; use of these medications might lead to hypertension or worsening BP control among those with hypertension. – Concurrent use of BP-elevating medication might attenuate BP-lowering effects of antihypertensive therapy or might also lead to a change in BP from drug interactions.

Prior studies have documented antihypertensive medication trends among the US population –; however, there is scarce literature on prescription fills for BP-elevating medications. One study, using the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey pooled data from 2009 to 2018, found that ≈18% of US adults with hypertension took medications that might cause elevated BP. Antidepressants, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and estrogen-containing medications were the most commonly reported classes, and the use of these medications was associated with greater odds of hypertension among adults not concurrently taking antihypertensive medications. Given the lack of progress in improving BP control among people with hypertension, including those on antihypertensive medications, it is critical to examine population-level factors that might worsen BP control, including trends in medications that can elevate BP. Understanding prescription trends for concurrent BP-elevating and antihypertensive medications might provide insights into the strategies needed to improve hypertension management and control.

The primary objective of this study is to present quarterly trends of prescription fills for BP-elevating and antihypertensive medications, individually and concurrently, among US individuals from 2017 to 2023. In addition, we present trends for BP-elevating and antihypertensive medications by sex and age group.

### Prevalence of potentially harmful multidrug interactions on medication lists of elderly ambulatory patients [^c74ac5a7]. BMC Geriatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Deprescribing rather than substitution may be a more effective strategy, especially for patients on psychotropics. It is not uncommon for patients to be prescribed three or more psychotropic medications, likely reflecting the increasing prevalence of psychotropic polypharmacy. Given the amplifying effect of psychotropic drugs, it is essential to assess the necessity and suitability of their use in elderly patients. Trazadone, one of the most prescribed psychotropic medications participating in multidrug interactions (Table 2) and associated with serotonin syndrome and seizures, is one of the least efficacious medications in treating depression and is associated with a higher suicide rate than other psychotropic medications. Despite the warnings, nearly 3 million Medicare beneficiaries received prescriptions for trazodone in 2019 of which over 400,000 would be expected to be exposed to an MDI including that drug (Table 2). Cyclobenzaprine, despite the characterization by the AGS Beers Criteria® for Potentially Inappropriate Medication Use in Older Adults as "questionable", is contraindicated in patients already taking drugs that prolong the QT, cause serotonin syndrome, or cause seizures. Nevertheless, 1.8 million Medicare beneficiaries were prescribed cyclobenzaprine in 2017, potentially exposing recipients to increased risk of life-threatening ADEs. Although deprescribing these medications might be the best strategy, to do so would require primary care physicians to coordinate care with the specialists who originally prescribed the other medications which is often a significant challenge.

Strengths

In 2015 Roughead warned that polypharmacy would inevitably result in multidrug interactions which would lead to an increased risk of ADEs. Since that call to arms, however, there have been no studies prior to ours that identify MDIs. This may because doing so requires a more complex computational approach. To identify two-drug DDIs, drug pairs on the patients' medication lists can be directly compared and matched to known two-drug interactions found in an enterprise EHR such as Cerner's. Identification of MDIs, however, requires either network analysis or complex structured queries of the institutional database (Supplemental Fig. 1). Both approaches, however, are well known to clinical informaticians and could easily be applied in clinical studies. Perhaps our results will inspire other to identify and characterize MDIs in their institutions' patient populations to expand the growing list of MDIs.

5.5 Increased Risk of Bleeding

Drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake inhibition, including trazodone, increase the risk of bleeding events. Concomitant use of aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), other antiplatelet drugs, warfarin, and other anticoagulants may add to this risk. Case reports and epidemiological studies (case-control and cohort design) have demonstrated an association between use of drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and the occurrence of gastrointestinal bleeding. Bleeding events related to drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake have ranged from ecchymosis, hematoma, epistaxis, and petechiae to life-threatening hemorrhages.

Inform patients about the risk of bleeding associated with the concomitant use of trazodone and antiplatelet agents or anticoagulants. For patients taking warfarin, carefully monitor coagulation indices when initiating, titrating, or discontinuing trazodone.

5.6 Priapism

Cases of priapism (painful erections greater than 6 hours in duration) have been reported in men receiving trazodone. Priapism, if not treated promptly, can result in irreversible damage to the erectile tissue. Men who have an erection lasting greater than 4 hours, whether painful or not, should immediately discontinue the drug and seek emergency medical attention [see Adverse Reactions (6.2), Overdosage (10)].

Trazodone should be used with caution in men who have conditions that might predispose them to priapism (e.g., sickle cell anemia, multiple myeloma, or leukemia), or in men with anatomical deformation of the penis (e.g., angulation, cavernosal fibrosis, or Peyronie's disease).

5.7 Activation of Mania or Hypomania

In patients with bipolar disorder, treating a depressive episode with trazodone or another antidepressant may precipitate a mixed/manic episode. Activation of mania/hypomania has been reported in a small proportion of patients with major affective disorder who were treated with antidepressants. Prior to initiating treatment with trazodone, screen patients for any personal or family history of bipolar disorder, mania, or hypomania [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

### The management of major depressive disorder: synopsis of the 2022 U.S. department of veterans affairs and U.S. department of defense clinical practice guideline [^2646241b]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Major depressive disorder — monoamine oxidase inhibitor safety and interactions: Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) have a low therapeutic index and, when combined with foods high in tyramine or certain serotonergic or sympathomimetic medications, carry the risk of potentially life-threatening hypertensive crisis and serotonin syndrome. Severe interactions can occur with tyramine intake, the risk of serotonin syndrome with multiple serotonergic agents is greatest when one or both agents are an MAOI, and sympathomimetic agents can precipitate hypertensive crisis when combined with MAOIs. All patients offered a TCA or MAOI should receive education about safety, side effects, and relevant drug-drug and drug-food interactions, and while not suggested as initial treatment strategies, TCAs and MAOIs continue to be effective for complex MDD.

2. Dosage and Administration

2.1 Dose Selection

An initial dose of 150 mg/day in divided doses is suggested. The dosage should be initiated at a low-dose and increased gradually, noting the clinical response and any evidence of intolerance. Occurrence of drowsiness may require the administration of a major portion of the daily dose at bedtime or a reduction of dosage.

The dose may be increased by 50 mg/day every 3 to 4 days. The maximum dose for outpatients usually should not exceed 400 mg/day in divided doses. Inpatients (i.e., more severely depressed patients) may be given up to but not in excess of 600 mg/day in divided doses.

Once an adequate response has been achieved, dosage may be gradually reduced, with subsequent adjustment depending on therapeutic response.

2.2 Improtant Administration Instructions

Trazodone hydrochloride tablets can be swallowed whole or administered as a half tablet by breaking the tablet along the score line.

Trazodone hydrochloride tablets should be taken shortly after a meal or light snack.

2.3 Screen for Bipolar Disorder Prior to Starting Trazodone

Prior to initiating treatment with trazodone hydrochloride tablets or another antidepressant, screen patients for a personal or family history of bipolar disorder, mania, or hypomania [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].

2.4 Switchning to or from Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitor Antidepressant

At least 14 days must elapse between discontinuation of a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) antidepressant and initiation of trazodone hydrochloride tablets. In addition, at least 14 days must elapse after stopping trazodone hydrochloride tablets before starting an MAOI antidepressant [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

2.5 Dosage Recommendations for Concomitant Use with Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors or Inducers

Coadministration with Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors

Consider reducing trazodone dose based on tolerability when trazodone is coadministered with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

Coadministration with Strong CYP3A4 Inducers

Consider increasing trazodone dose based on therapeutic response when trazodone is coadministered with a strong CYP3A4 inducer [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

2.6 Discontinuation of Treatment with Trazodone

Adverse reactions may occur upon discontinuation of trazodone [See Warnings and Precautions (5.8)]. Gradually reduce the dosage rather than stopping trazodone abruptly whenever possible.

### Hypertension in children with intellectual disabilities: a population not to be overseen [^46be0bec]. Journal of Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

Sleep

Lack of sufficient nighttime sleep and poor sleep quality are significant risk factors for obesity, HTN, and cardiovascular disease. Sleep disorders in individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders are often chronic, persisting into adolescence or adulthood. They face a higher risk of specific sleep disorders, including insomnia, excessive daytime sleepiness, and sleep-related breathing issues, compared to their typically developing peers. Factors such as co-sleeping with parents and a family history of sleep issues contribute to further increase this risk autonomic nervous system, which is crucial for maintaining the correct daily rhythm of BP.

Children with intellectual disability experience sleep disorders more frequently than their typically developing peers. For example, sleep problems affect up to 74% of children and adolescents with Down syndrome. The cause of sleep disorders in individuals with intellectual disability is complex and involves various medical conditions, including gastroesophageal reflux, epileptic seizures, poor sleep hygiene, environmental factors, medication use, anxiety, restless legs syndrome, and obstructive sleep apnea. In some patients, sleep disturbances are a phenotypic feature of a specific disorder or genetic condition. Understanding the characteristic patterns of these disorders can aid in diagnosing the syndrome itself and its consequences for the cardiovascular system.

Awareness of specific sleep disorders in individuals with intellectual disability is essential for accurate diagnosis, effective treatment, and the prevention of HTN. After excluding medical contributors and other primary sleep disorders (e.g. epilepsy, gastroesophageal reflux, iron deficiency, obstructive sleep apnea, and periodic limb movements), parent based-education, and behavioral interventions are the first-line treatment of insomnia. If these methods prove ineffective, pharmacotherapy may be considered, with drug selection depending on the type of sleep disorder.

For circadian rhythm disorders, melatonin is the preferred treatment. In cases of primary insomnia characterized by delayed sleep onset and/or frequent nocturnal awakenings, diphenhydramine, hydroxyzine, niaprazine, zolpidem, or trazodone may be used. For sleep disorders associated with epilepsy, restless legs syndrome, or resistant sleep-onset insomnia, clonazepam or gabapentin can be considered. In patients with ADHD or disruptive behavior disorders, clonidine is the first-choice medication. Effective treatment of sleep disorders not only improves the functioning of patients with mental disabilities but also reduces their risk of developing heart and vascular diseases.

### Trazodone hydrochloride [^eee62020]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Monitor all patients taking trazodone for the emergence of serotonin syndrome. Discontinue treatment with trazodone and any concomitant serotonergic agents immediately if the above symptoms occur, and initiate supportive symptomatic treatment. If concomitant use of trazodone with other serotonergic drugs is clinically warranted, inform patients of the increased risk for serotonin syndrome and monitor for symptoms.

5.3 Cardiac Arrhythmias

Clinical studies indicate that trazodone hydrochloride may be arrhythmogenic in patients with preexisting cardiac disease. Arrhythmias identified include isolated PVCs, ventricular couplets, tachycardia with syncope, and torsade de pointes. Postmarketing events, including torsade de pointes have been reported at doses of 100 mg or less with the immediate-release form of trazodone. Trazodone should also be avoided in patients with a history of cardiac arrhythmias, as well as other circumstances that may increase the risk of the occurrence of torsade de pointes and/or sudden death, including symptomatic bradycardia, hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia, and the presence of congenital prolongation of the QT interval. Trazodone is not recommended for use during the initial recovery phase of myocardial infarction. Caution should be used when administering trazodone to patients with cardiac disease and such patients should be closely monitored, since antidepressant drugs (including trazodone) may cause cardiac arrhythmias [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

### Concomitant drug interactions with non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants are associated with bleeding and mortality risk in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation [^dfe30371]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Data Source and Study Procedure

Patients were identified using the Clinical Data Analysis and Reporting System of the Hospital Authority in Hong Kong. The Hospital Authority is an institution that manages all public hospitals and outpatient clinics in Hong Kong and provides health care services to > 90% of the citizens. Clinical Data Analysis and Reporting System is an internationally recognized electronic health record database with large population coverage, comprehensive clinical data, and excellent data quality, and has been used to conduct high‐quality pharmacoepidemiologic studies. Demographic data, including age and date of birth, and cardiovascular comorbidities, including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, ischemic heart disease, heart failure, and stroke, were recorded. Estimated glomerular filtration rate was calculated using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation. CHA 2 DS 2 ‐VASc score is a composite score incorporating congestive heart failure, age, diabetes, stroke or systemic embolism, vascular disease, and sex category. The occurrence of adverse clinical outcomes, including intracranial hemorrhage, gastrointestinal bleeding, hospitalization for major bleeding attributable to intracranial hemorrhage and/or gastrointestinal bleeding, and all‐cause mortality, was extracted. Gastrointestinal bleeding was evaluated because previous randomized controlled trials demonstrated NOAC patients are at high risk of developing the adverse event than those taking warfarin. Gastrointestinal bleeding in the esophagus, stomach, duodenum, and small and large bowels was included in this study, with details on International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD‐9‐CM), codes used listed in Table S1.

Concomitant medications with possible drug‐drug interaction with NOACs listed in the 2021 European Heart Rhythm Association Practical Guide on the Use of Non–Vitamin K Antagonist Oral Anticoagulants in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation were extracted from the Clinical Data Analysis and Reporting System using the British National Formulary classification, as follows: antiarrhythmic (amiodarone, digoxin, diltiazem, dronedarone, and verapamil), antidepressant (citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, desvenlafaxine, duloxetine, venlafaxine, trazodone, amitriptyline, clomipramine, imipramine, dosulepin, nortriptyline, and bupropion), antimicrobial (clarithromycin, erythromycin, fluconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, and posaconazole), and atorvastatin. Flecainide and β‐blockers, which are not expected to have drug‐drug interaction with NOAC, were included in the analysis as control groups.

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Pharmacodynamic drug–drug interactions with antihypertensive medications — cautionary and advantageous combinations are listed with clinical effects: Any antihypertensive medication with NSAIDs reduces BP lowering via sodium retention; sympathomimetic (eg, pseudoephedrine, dextrom- amfetamine) and venlafaxine reduce BP lowering; nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (CCB) with beta blockers cause bradycardia or atrioventricular block; angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) with angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) can cause AKI and hyperkalemia, and with potassium-sparing diuretics (spironolactone, eplerenone, triamterene, amiloride), sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, or potassium supplements cause hyperkalemia; ACEi with NSAIDs (eg, ibuprofen, naproxen) can cause AKI; clonidine, methyldopa, or guanfacine with central nervous system (CNS) depressants (eg, zolpidem, alprazolam) cause sedation; clonidine with noncardioselective beta blockers (eg, nadolol or propranolol) can result in unopposed alpha agonism upon beta blocker withdrawal leading to hypertensive crisis. Advantageous interactions include dihydropyridine CCB plus renin–angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitor reducing risk of dihydropyridine CCB–induced lower leg swelling; RAS inhibitors plus diuretics balancing serum potassium effects with diminished possibility for hypokalemia (with diuretic) or hyperkalemia (with renin–angiotensin aldosterone system inhibitor [RAASi]); RAS inhibitors plus potassium binder lowering hyperkalemia risk from the RAS inhibitor; and diuretic plus potassium supplement lowering risk of hypokalemia from the diuretic.

### Baseline clinical characteristics, comorbidities and prescribed medication in a real-world population of patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis: the PROOF registry [^83af5e69]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2018). Medium credibility.

Comorbidities and prescribed medications

Gastrointestinal disorders and metabolism and nutrition disorders were the most prevalent comorbidities reported at baseline, present in 50.2% and 39.7% of patients, respectively, including 47.3% of patients who reported gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Musculoskeletal disorders were present in 18.8% of patients, while respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders were present in 19.9% of patients, including 4.0% of patients who reported pulmonary hypertension and 4.0% of patients who reported emphysema. Other specific common comorbidities included vascular disorders (37.9%), hypertension (33.2%) and cardiac disorders (27.8%; table 4).

Table 4
Comorbidities recorded at registry inclusion.

Overall, 69.3% of patients were prescribed an antifibrotic at baseline, initiated either prior to, or at the time of, inclusion in the registry, with 186 and 6 patients prescribed pirfenidone and nintedanib, respectively (table 5). Among those patients prescribed pirfenidone, the most frequently co-prescribed medications were antihypertensives, which were prescribed in 54.8% of patients receiving pirfenidone. This was followed by statins (37.1%) and prophylactic antithrombotics or anticoagulants (36.6%), for example, aspirin or low-dose low-molecular-weight heparins (table 5). We also investigated the concomitant prescribing of pirfenidone and antidepressants, neuroleptics or hypnotics based on the potential interaction between pirfenidone and some of these medications. Concomitant antidepressants, neuroleptics or hypnotics were prescribed in 2.7% of patients receiving pirfenidone (duloxetine, n = 1; prothipendyl, n = 1; amitriptyline, n = 3; escitalopram, n = 1; lorazepam, n = 1; trazodone, n = 1; some patients received more than one of the medications listed).

### Use of multiple anticholinergic medications can predispose patients to severe non-exertional hyperthermia [^5d1c8b96]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

We present a case of a 64-year-old woman who developed severe non-exertional hyperthermia (NEHT) due to excessive anticholinergic effects from her psychiatric medications. The patient was found unresponsive in a non-air-conditioned room where the outside temperature was over 33°C. She presented with altered mental status, hypotension and an oral temperature of 42°C. Drug–drug interactions from her home medications for depression, bipolar disorder and seizures (amitriptyline, cyclobenzaprine, benztropine, topiramate, clonazepam, trazodone) were suspected. Blood cultures grew Staphylococcus hominis. The patient quickly returned to baseline with supportive care in the intensive care unit. She was treated for the Staph hominis bacteraemia with a 7-day course of vancomycin. Due to her quick recovery and lack of neurological findings, severe NEHT with associated bacteraemia was determined to have caused her presenting symptoms. This patient's multiple anticholinergic medications increased her susceptibility to develop NEHT by inhibited sweating, this patient's natural cooling mechanism.

### Serotonergic and adrenergic drug interactions associated with linezolid: a critical review and practical management approach [^e613ee2d]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe the evidence for serotonergic and adrenergic drug interactions with linezolid and discuss clinical management strategies.

Data Sources

A literature search of PubMed (1947-November 2012), MEDLINE (1946-November 2012), EMBASE (1974-November 2012), and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970-November 2012) was conducted using the terms linezolid, drug interaction, serotonin syndrome, serotonin toxicity, sympathomimetic, serotonergic agents, and adrenergic agents. Citations of retrieved articles were also reviewed.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

English-language articles describing coadministration of serotonergic or adrenergic agents with linezolid to humans were included. Studies published only in abstract form were excluded.

Data Synthesis

One prospective study, 6 retrospective studies, and 24 case reports were identified describing a serotonergic or adrenergic drug interaction. Incidence of serotonin syndrome in patients on linezolid and serotonergic agents ranged between 0.24% and 4%. Serotonergic agents determined to have probable (according to the Horn Drug Interaction Probability Scale) linezolid interactions in case reports included meperidine, citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, duloxetine, and venlafaxine. Serotonergic agent dose and duration of coadministration with linezolid did not appear to influence the occurrence of serotonin syndrome. Adrenergic medication coadministration was associated with a possible drug interaction as determined by the Horn Drug Interaction Probability Scale but did not appear to result in clinically significant drug interactions with linezolid.

Conclusions

Linezolid-associated serotonergic drug interactions occur more commonly than adrenergic interactions. Serotonergic interactions considered probable according to the Horn Drug Interaction Probability Scale do not appear to correlate with drug dosage; time of onset ranges from < 1 to 20 days, and effect resolves in < 1 to 5 days after discontinuation of offending agents. If coadministration of linezolid and a serotonergic agent cannot be avoided, clinicians should be aware of the symptoms and management of serotonergic toxicity; close monitoring is recommended and additional serotonergic agents should not be used. While adrenergic drug interactions with linezolid are less common in clinical practice, monitoring for signs of hypertension remains important.

Subgroup analysis of systolic blood pressure change from baseline by use of antihypertensive medications

At baseline, in the pooled tirzepatide treatment groups, 72.4% of participants were receiving antihypertensive medications. Similarly, in the pooled comparator group, 78.1% were receiving antihypertensive medications at baseline. In the SURPASS-4 study which enrolled participants with established CV disease, 94% were receiving antihypertensive medications at baseline. (Table 1).

Reductions in SBP with tirzepatide were not dependent on concomitant antihypertensive medications as similar reductions were observed whether participants were receiving them or not (tirzepatide 5 mg, − 5.0 vs − 4.3 mmHg; tirzepatide 10 mg, − 5.7 vs − 5.8 mmHg; tirzepatide 15 mg, − 7.0 vs − 7.0 mmHg) with a non-significant treatment by antihypertensive medication (Yes, No) interaction (P = 0.77) (Fig. 4).

### Prevalence of potentially harmful multidrug interactions on medication lists of elderly ambulatory patients [^9577e609]. BMC Geriatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Results

Drug-drug interactions

The 6,545 patients whose medications lists were extracted for analysis had a mean age of 72.5 ± 8.2 and were 53% female. A total of 20,755 medications, 533 of which were unique, were on the medication lists. Of these patients' lists, 487 (7.4%) contained two-drug DDIs, involving 1,042 medications, of which 146 were unique, and 85 (1.3%) contained MDIs involving 305 medications, of which 116 were unique. Five of the 85 medication lists contained a second MDI bringing the total MDIs to 90. The average number of medications on the lists was 3.1 ± 2.3 in patients with no drug interactions, 6.6 ± 2.9 in patients with two-drug DDIs, and 8.6 ± 3.4 in patients with MDIs. The majority of MDIs in patients' medications lists involved three interacting drugs (75.6%) while the remainder were composed of four (15.6%) or five or more (8.9%) interacting drugs.

Medications involved in multidrug interactions

The most common medications involved in the MDIs and their associated drug classes are listed in Table 1. Psychotropic medications were the most involved representing 35.1% of all drugs associated with MDIs. Medications affecting the cardiovascular system and hemostasis, and opiates were the other major classes involved.

Table 1
Most common drugs involved in MDIs per class

Although the overall prevalence of MDIs was 1.3%, the prevalence of MDIs in patients prescribed one of a small subset of drugs was considerably higher (Table 2). The highest prevalence of MDIs was on medication lists containing amiodarone (27.3%), followed by methotrexate (23.1%), bupropion (18.7%), tramadol (16.3%), trazadone (14.6%), and cyclobenzaprine (14.3%). The numbers of Medicare beneficiaries who filled prescriptions with the highest prevalence drugs are listed on Table 2 as well as the calculated number of patients potentially exposed to MDIs.

### Trazodone hydrochloride [^ad83566b]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.8 Discontinuation Syndrome

Adverse reactions after discontinuation of serotonergic antidepressants, particularly after abrupt discontinuation, include: nausea, sweating, dysphoric mood, irritability, agitation, dizziness, sensory disturbances (e.g., paresthesia, such as electric shock sensations), tremor, anxiety, confusion, headache, lethargy, emotional lability, insomnia, hypomania, tinnitus, and seizures. A gradual reduction in dosage rather than abrupt cessation is recommended whenever possible [See Dosage and Administration (2.6)].

5.9 Potential for Cognitive and Motor Impairment

Trazodone may cause somnolence or sedation and may impair the mental and/or physical ability required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks. Patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles, until they are reasonably certain that the drug treatment does not affect them adversely.

5.10 Angle-Closure Glaucoma

The pupillary dilation that occurs following use of many antidepressant drugs including trazodone may trigger an angle closure attack in a patient with anatomically narrow angles who does not have a patent iridectomy. Avoid use of antidepressants, including trazodone, in patients with untreated anatomically narrow angles.

5.11 Hyponatremia

Hyponatremia may occur as a result of treatment with SNRIs and SSRIs, including trazodone. Cases with serum sodium lower than 110 mmol/L have been reported. Signs and symptoms of hyponatremia include headache, difficulty concentrating, memory impairment, confusion, weakness, and unsteadiness, which can lead to falls. Signs and symptoms associated with more severe and/or acute cases have included hallucination, syncope, seizure, coma, respiratory arrest, and death. In many cases, this hyponatremia appears to be the result of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH).

In patients with symptomatic hyponatremia, discontinue trazodone and institute appropriate medical intervention. Elderly patients, patients taking diuretics, and those who are volume-depleted may be at greater risk of developing hyponatremia with SSRIs and SNRIs [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)].

### Dietary restrictions and drug interactions with monoamine oxidase inhibitors: the state of the art [^94476c56]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2007). Low credibility.

Antidepressant activity of monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) was initially noted in the 1950s, and by the early 1960s, they were a mainstay of antidepressant treatment. Reports of adverse events such as acute hypertensive reactions following the ingestion of certain foods and beverages tempered clinicians' enthusiasm for MAOIs. Introduction of the tricyclic antidepressants and the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors led to declines in the use of MAOIs. However, MAOIs have been well established as an effective intervention for people with treatment-resistant depression, and transdermal formulations may provide a valuable therapeutic option and eliminate the drug-food interaction.

With CYP3A4 inhibition via amlodipine, verapamil, or diltiazem or other CYP3A4 inhibitors, eplerenone has increased risk of hypotension and hyperkalemia and a lowered dose when combined with diltiazem could be considered a productive interaction. Elimination and transporter interactions include thiazide-type diuretics or RAS blockers reducing lithium clearance with increased lithium toxicity risk, and reduced P-gp efflux of dabigatran increasing dabigatran levels with a higher risk of bleeding.

### Clinical practice guideline for the pharmacologic treatment of chronic insomnia in adults: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline [^36e1d3f5]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Trazodone 50 mg — primary insomnia efficacy and harms: A single study of trazodone 50 mg met inclusion criteria with no meta-analysis available and the overall quality of evidence was moderate due to potential publication bias; patient-reported outcomes showed a modest reduction in sleep latency below the clinical significance threshold, while increases in total sleep time and reductions in wake after sleep onset did not reach clinical thresholds, quality of sleep was not significantly improved, and reductions in number of awakenings fell just below clinical significance, so none of the sleep outcome variables improved to a clinically significant degree. There was no meta-analysis of harms; in the Walsh study the trazodone group experienced significantly more side effects than placebo, with headache 30% versus 19% and somnolence 23% versus 8%, and overall adverse events in 75% of trazodone subjects compared to 65.4% with placebo. Given the absence of demonstrated efficacy on numerous critical outcomes and limited harms data, the task force judged the harms to potentially outweigh the benefits, yet determined that the majority of patients would be likely to use trazodone compared to no treatment.

### Long-term trazodone use and cognition: a potential therapeutic role for slow-wave sleep enhancers [^bfb30073]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2019). Medium credibility.

There are also inherent limitations to our study, primarily due to its retrospective nature. Ideally, we would prospectively standardize medication dosage and timing, after randomized allocation between groups, and monitor medication compliance across a predefined time period. For example, benefits observed in the trazodone group may reflect better overall medical management of participants by their physicians and delayed cognitive decline due to unaccounted factors. Possible adverse effects of trazodone were not explicitly reported during the assessment of participants' medication regimen. It is thus possible there is a biased selection against people who tried but did not tolerate trazodone for inclusion in the trazodone group, but who could have been included in the trazodone non-user group. Such participants may be more resistant in achieving better sleep consolidation through SWS enhancers. Alternatively, there may be different metabolism of trazodone in these participants, given that prior work indicates its active metabolite may have different effects on alertness compared to trazodone itself, a possibility that personalized medicine may be able to address. Eventually, optimal accounting for confounders necessitates prospective double-blind randomized trials to confirm that differential rates of cognitive decline are directly caused by trazodone. Such prospective studies, ideally incorporating interval cognitive evaluations, could also answer whether potential long-term trazodone benefits are due to continuous modulation of brain networks, or whether they primarily reflect early treatment period effects. Even though there are no prospective long-term studies of trazodone for insomnia in elders, long-term persistent benefits have been observed in depression.

Background

Many hypertension therapeutics were developed prior to major advances in drug receptor theory. Moreover, newer drugs may take advantage of some of the newly understood modalities of receptor function.

Goal

The goal of this review is to provide an up-to-date summary of drug receptor theory. This is followed by a discussion of the drug classes recognized for treating hypertension to which new concepts in receptor theory apply.

Results

We raise ideas for mechanisms of potential new antihypertensive drugs and whether they may take advantage of new theories in drug-receptor interaction.

Antihypertensive medication interactions — pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic categories are described with clinically relevant examples. Drug-drug interactions are categorized as either pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic, and important pharmacokinetic interactions involve the CYP3A4 pathway in which verapamil and diltiazem can alter metabolism. Beneficial pharmacodynamic combinations include a renin–angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitor with a thiazide-type diuretic to minimize hypokalemia or a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker (CCB) with a RAS inhibitor to reduce lower extremity edema, whereas combining angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) or direct renin inhibitors increases risk of hyperkalemia.

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Medication interactions in hypertension management — drug–drug interactions are categorized as pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic, and knowledge of these interactions is essential; important pharmacokinetic interactions involve the CYP3A4 pathway because verapamil and diltiazem are both substrates and inhibitors of CYP3A4 and can alter the metabolism of other medications, beneficial pharmacodynamic pairs include an RAS inhibitor with a thiazide-type diuretic to minimize diuretic-induced hypokalemia or a dihydropyridine CCB with an RAS inhibitor to reduce lower extremity edema, whereas combining drugs with overlapping mechanisms like ACEI and ARB or direct renin inhibitors leads to an increased risk of hyperkalemia.

### Finasteride and tadalafil (Entadfi) [^237f821e]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

5.2 Potential for Drug Interactions when Taking ENTADFI

ENTADFI provides continuous plasma tadalafil levels. Consider this when evaluating the potential for ENTADFI interactions with medications (e.g., nitrates, alpha-blockers, anti-hypertensives and strong inhibitors of CYP3A4) and with substantial consumption of alcohol [see Drug Interactions (7)].

5.3 Concomitant Use with Alpha-blockers or Antihypertensives

Discuss with patients the potential for ENTADFI to augment the blood-pressure-lowering effect of alpha-blockers and antihypertensive medications [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

Caution is advised when PDE5 inhibitors are coadministered with alpha-blockers. PDE5 inhibitors, including ENTADFI, and alpha-adrenergic blocking agents are both vasodilators with blood-pressure-lowering effects. When vasodilators are used in combination, an additive effect on blood pressure may be anticipated. In some patients, concomitant use of these two drug classes can lower blood pressure significantly [see Drug Interactions (7.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)], which may lead to symptomatic hypotension (e.g., fainting). Consider the following:

BPH

The efficacy of the coadministration of an alpha-blocker and ENTADFI for the treatment of BPH has not been adequately studied, and due to the potential vasodilatory effects of combined use resulting in blood pressure lowering, the combination of ENTADFI and alpha-blockers is not recommended for the treatment of BPH [see Drug Interactions (7.2), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].
Discontinue alpha-blockers at least one day prior to starting ENTADFI for once daily use for the treatment of BPH.

5.4 Consideration of Other Urological Conditions Prior to Initiating Treatment for BPH

Prior to initiating treatment with ENTADFI for BPH, consider whether the patient has other urological conditions that may cause similar symptoms. In addition, prostate cancer and BPH may coexist.

Carefully monitor patients with large residual urinary volume and/or severely diminished urinary flow for obstructive uropathy. These patients may not be candidates for ENTADFI therapy.

Other Risk Factors for

Other relevant variables included demographics including age, sex, race or ethnicity (Black, Hispanic, White, or Other [American Indian or Alaska Native; Asian; Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, mixed race, declined, or unknown]), marital status, participation in active‐duty military service; and lifestyle factors including obesity (body mass index [BMI] ≥ 30 kg/m² and smoking status (current, former, never). Validated ICD‐9‐CM or ICD‐10‐CM codes were used to identify diagnoses of alcohol abuse, drug use (aggregated from use of cocaine, opioids, sedative/hypnotics, other drugs, or polysubstance use), OSA, hypertension, lipid disorders, diabetes, congestive heart failure (CHF), coronary artery disease (CAD), myocardial infarction (MI), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), major depressive disorder (MDD), and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Given the high multicollinearity between psychiatric comorbidities, a composite variable was created from the presence of either GAD, MDD, or PTSD, with time to event based on the first diagnosis. For sensitivity analyses, CPT codes were used to identify individuals who were prescribed a continuous positive airway pressure (ie, CPAP) device and with a history of a sleep study (eg, 95 800, 95 801, 95 805, 95 806, G0399, G0400), to better categorize those with OSA.

Prescription data for antihypertensives (eg, angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, beta‐blockers), stimulants (ie, amphetamines, methylphenidate), and medications used to manage sleep (eg, estazolam, eszopiclone, melatonin, trazodone) were obtained from VA pharmacy records to reflect relevant medication use. Health care utilization was defined as the total number of primary care visits in the first 2 years of VA care.

### Dietary restrictions and drug interactions with monoamine oxidase inhibitors: an update [^50c94107]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2012). Low credibility.

Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) are effective treatments for depression that has atypical features or that has failed to respond to other antidepressants. However, MAOIs are underused because clinicians are concerned about dietary and drug interactions with this class of medication. Hypertensive crisis and serotonin syndrome can occur in rare cases due to interactions between MAOIs and foods containing tyramine as well as interactions with serotonergic and sympathomimetic agents. A better understanding of the foods and drugs that can cause adverse reactions, as well as knowledge of newer MAOIs with mechanisms of action and delivery methods that reduce these risks, may help clinicians to consider the use of these medications, when appropriate, in their patients with depression.

### Selegiline (Emsam) [^2e495097]. FDA (2020). Medium credibility.

5.3 Blood Pressure Elevation

Tyramine-Induced Hypertensive Crisis

EMSAM inhibits the catabolism of dietary amines, such as tyramine, and has the potential to produce a hypertensive crisis following the ingestion of tyramine-rich foods or beverages [see Drug Interactions (7.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

Hypertensive crises, which in some cases may be fatal, are characterized by some or all of the following symptoms: occipital headache which may radiate frontally, palpitation, neck stiffness or soreness, nausea, vomiting, sweating (sometimes with fever and sometimes with cold, clammy skin), dilated pupils, and photophobia. Either tachycardia or bradycardia may be present and can be associated with constricting chest pain. Intracranial bleeding has been reported in association with the increase in blood pressure. Patients should be instructed as to the signs and symptoms of severe hypertension and advised to seek immediate medical attention if these signs or symptoms are present.

If a hypertensive crisis occurs, EMSAM should be discontinued immediately and therapy to lower blood pressure should be instituted immediately. Fever should be managed by means of external cooling. Patients must be closely monitored until symptoms have stabilized. To prevent a hypertensive crisis, patients receiving treatment with EMSAM 9 mg per 24 hours or EMSAM 12 mg per 24 hours should follow the advice regarding a low tyramine diet described in Table 5 under Dietary Modifications Required for Patients Taking EMSAM 9 mg per 24 hours and 12 mg per 24 hours [see Drug Interactions (7.2)].

Blood Pressure Elevation Related to Concomitant Medication

Carbamazepine is contraindicated with EMSAM because carbamazepine has been shown to significantly elevate selegiline levels, which may increase the risk of a hypertensive crisis [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7.4)].

The use of EMSAM with adrenergic drugs or buspirone may produce substantial increases in blood pressure. Therefore, monitor blood pressure if EMSAM is used with any of the following drugs: buspirone, amphetamines, or cold products or weight-reducing preparations that contain sympathomimetic amines (e.g., pseudoephedrine, phenylephrine, phenylpropanolamine, and ephedrine).

### Electroconvulsive therapy and cardiovascular complications in patients taking trazodone for insomnia [^ea95d023]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Trazodone has been used widely to treat insomnia in depressed patients. When used in combination with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), trazodone has been suspected to cause cardiovascular side effects.

Method

A retrospective study was done of 100 patients who received ECT with concurrent trazodone. One patient was excluded because permission to review the patient's records had not been given. The remaining 99 patients were matched with control ECT patients.

Results

No statistically significant between-group differences were identified in cardiovascular side effects, although a trend toward more orthostatic hypotension was observed in patients taking trazodone.

Conclusion

Administering low-dose trazodone for insomnia in conjunction with ECT does not appear to increase cardiovascular complications. The true incidence of adverse cardiac events was not higher than 3.66% at a 95% confidence level.

### Guidance for incorporating FDA processes into the ACC / AHA clinical practice guideline methodology: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^5b424ac7]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Resistant hypertension — medication contributors and foundational regimen — Approximately 20% of adults with hypertension reported regular use of over-the-counter or nonprescription medications that may directly raise BP, and these medications are associated with uncontrolled BP and should be reviewed during evaluation of patients with resistant hypertension; some prescription drugs known to elevate BP should be replaced with alternative agents that avoid hypertensive side effects, if possible. Antihypertensive drug therapy should start with a combination of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), a calcium channel blocker (CCB), and a diuretic, and replacing thiazide-type diuretics with thiazide-like diuretics may offer additional BP reduction and cardiovascular protection. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have shown that addition of spironolactone (25–50 mg/day) as the fourth drug reduced home and 24-hour systolic blood pressure (SBP) by 6.6 to 8.7 mm Hg compared with placebo in patients with resistant hypertension and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥ 45 mL/ min/1.73 m²; the reduction in BP was greater than with addition of doxazosin or bisoprolol and greater than clonidine, yet 4% to 40% of adults with resistant hypertension cannot tolerate spironolactone due to hyperkalemia or antiandrogenic side effects.

### Long-term effects of weight-reducing drugs in people with hypertension [^d9234b99]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

This is the third update of this review, first published in July 2009. All major guidelines on treatment of hypertension recommend weight loss; anti-obesity drugs may be able to help in this respect.

Objectives

Primary objectives: To assess the long-term effects of pharmacologically-induced reduction in body weight in adults with essential hypertension on all-cause mortality, cardiovascular morbidity, and adverse events (including total serious adverse events, withdrawal due to adverse events, and total non-serious adverse events). Secondary objectives: To assess the long-term effects of pharmacologically-induced reduction in body weight in adults with essential hypertension on change from baseline in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and on body weight reduction.

Search Methods

For this updated review, the Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomised controlled trials up to March 2020: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov. The searches had no language restrictions. We contacted authors of relevant papers about further published and unpublished work.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of at least 24 weeks' duration in adults with hypertension that compared approved long-term weight-loss medications to placebo. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently selected studies, assessed risks of bias, and extracted data. Where appropriate and in the absence of significant heterogeneity between studies (P > 0.1), we pooled studies using a fixed-effect meta-analysis. When heterogeneity was present, we used the random-effects method and investigated the cause of the heterogeneity.

Main Results

This third update of the review added one new trial, investigating the combination of naltrexone/bupropion versus placebo. Two medications, which were included in the previous versions of this review (rimonabant and sibutramine) are no longer considered relevant for this update, since their marketing approval was withdrawn in 2010 and 2009, respectively. The number of included studies in this review update is therefore six (12,724 participants in total): four RCTs comparing orlistat to placebo, involving a total of 3132 participants with high blood pressure and a mean age of 46 to 55 years; one trial comparing phentermine/topiramate to placebo, involving 1305 participants with high blood pressure and a mean age of 53 years; and one trial comparing naltrexone/bupropion to placebo, involving 8283 participants with hypertension and a mean age of 62 years. We judged the risks of bias to be unclear for the trials investigating orlistat or naltrexone/bupropion. and low for the trial investigating phentermine/topiramate. Only the study of naltrexone/bupropion included cardiovascular mortality and morbidity as predefined outcomes. There were no differences in the rates of all-cause or cardiovascular mortality, major cardiovascular events, or serious adverse events between naltrexone/bupropion and placebo. The incidence of overall adverse events was significantly higher in participants treated with naltrexone/bupropion. For orlistat, the incidence of gastrointestinal side effects was consistently higher compared to placebo. The most frequent side effects with phentermine/topiramate were dry mouth and paraesthesia. After six to 12 months, orlistat reduced systolic blood pressure compared to placebo by mean difference (MD) -2.6 mm Hg (95% confidence interval (CI) -3.8 to -1.4 mm Hg; 4 trials, 2058 participants) and diastolic blood pressure by MD -2.0 mm Hg (95% CI -2.7 to -1.2 mm Hg; 4 trials, 2058 participants). After 13 months of follow-up, phentermine/topiramate decreased systolic blood pressure compared to placebo by -2.0 to -4.2 mm Hg (1 trial, 1030 participants) (depending on drug dosage), and diastolic blood pressure by -1.3 to -1.9 mm Hg (1 trial, 1030 participants) (depending on drug dosage). There was no difference in the change in systolic or diastolic blood pressure between naltrexone/bupropion and placebo (1 trial, 8283 participants). We identified no relevant studies investigating liraglutide or lorcaserin in people with hypertension.

Authors' Conclusions

In people with elevated blood pressure, orlistat, phentermine/topiramate and naltrexone/bupropion reduced body weight; the magnitude of the effect was greatest with phentermine/topiramate. In the same trials, orlistat and phentermine/topiramate, but not naltrexone/bupropion, reduced blood pressure. One RCT of naltrexone/bupropion versus placebo showed no differences in all-cause mortality or cardiovascular mortality or morbidity after two years. The European Medicines Agency refused marketing authorisation for phentermine/topiramate due to safety concerns, while for lorcaserin the application for European marketing authorisation was withdrawn due to a negative overall benefit/risk balance. In 2020 lorcaserin was also withdrawn from the US market. Two other medications (rimonabant and sibutramine) had already been withdrawn from the market in 2009 and 2010, respectively.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Antihypertensive medication interactions — classification, CYP3A4 involvement, and combination effects — are described with practical examples: Drug-drug interactions are categorized as pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic, with key pharmacokinetic interactions involving the CYP3A4 pathway where verapamil and diltiazem can alter metabolism of other medications. Beneficial pharmacodynamic combinations include pairing a renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitor with a thiazide-type diuretic to minimize diuretic-induced hypokalemia or combining a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker (CCB) with a RAS inhibitor to reduce lower extremity edema, whereas overlapping mechanisms such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) plus angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) or direct renin inhibitor increase the risk of hyperkalemia as an adverse pharmacodynamic interaction.

### 2024 ESC guidelines for the management of elevated blood pressure and hypertension [^8cd578f1]. European Heart Journal (2024). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for hypertension, more specifically with respect to choice of antihypertensives, subsequent therapy, ESC 2024 guidelines recommend to do not combine two renin-angiotensin system blockers (an ACEi and an ARB).

### Effects of intensive blood pressure treatment on orthostatic hypertension: individual level meta-analysis [^bac89f5a]. BMJ (2025). Excellent credibility.

What this study adds

Using data from nine randomized trials of > 30 000 participants, this individual level meta-analysis shows that more intensive blood pressure treatment reduces the occurrence of orthostatic hypertension
Many of the included trials used first line antihypertensive agents, suggesting that common approaches for seated hypertension may also be used to treat orthostatic hypertension
Although orthostatic hypertension is common among adults with hypertension, it may be treated using standard approaches recommended for seated hypertension

### Anti-obesity medications and investigational agents: an Obesity Medicine Association (OMA) clinical practice statement (CPS) 2022 [^258981bd]. Obesity Pillars (2022). High credibility.

Naltrexone HCl/bupropion HCl extended release — indications, dosing, and interactions are as follows. Naltrexone is an opioid antagonist and bupropion is an aminoketone antidepressant with relatively weak inhibition of neuronal reuptake of norepinephrine and dopamine, and the Drug Enforcement Agency Schedule is not a scheduled drug. Tablets = 8 mg/90 mg (naltrexone HCl/bupropion HCl extended release), and the tablets should not be cut, chewed, or crushed. Dosing is: Week 1 = 1 tablet in AM, no tablets in PM; Week 2 = 1 tablet in AM, 1 tablet in PM; Week 3 = 2 tablets in AM, 1 tablet in PM; Week 4 and beyond = 2 tablets in AM, 2 tablets in PM (~12 hours after AM dose). Potential drug interactions state it should not be administered with opioids due to the naltrexone component, with all opioids discontinued at least 7 days prior to start of naltrexone HCl/bupropion HCl, and monoamine oxidase inhibitors may increase the risk of hypertensive reactions when used concomitantly.

### Nalbuphine hci [^72c911db]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. Follow patients closely for signs of respiratory depression and sedation [see WARNINGS].

Serotonergic Drugs

The concomitant use of opioids with other drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter system, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), triptans, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, drugs that affect the serotonin neurotransmitter system (e.g., mirtazapine, trazodone, tramadol), certain muscle relaxants (i.e., cyclobenzaprine, metaxalone), and monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue), has resulted in serotonin syndrome [see PRECAUTIONS; Information for Patients].

If concomitant use is warranted, carefully observe the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dose adjustment. Discontinue Nalbuphine Hydrochloride Injection if serotonin syndrome is suspected.

Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs)

MAOI (e.g., phenelzine, tranylcypromine, linezolid) interactions with opioids may manifest as serotonin syndrome [see Drug Interactions] or opioid toxicity (e.g., respiratory depression, coma [see Warnings]).
