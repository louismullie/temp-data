## Question

child-pugh score for cirrhosis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the Child-Pugh score for cirrhosis, including its components, scoring, classes, clinical applications, limitations, and how it compares with MELD and other tools. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the historical development and intended purpose of the Child-Pugh score. Then, I should verify the exact components and scoring thresholds. Next, I will classify the risk strata and reconcile any conflicting mortality estimates. After that, I need to review validated clinical applications across surgery, HCC, variceal bleeding, transplant, and drug dosing. Then, I should appraise limitations and interobserver variability. Finally, I will compare with MELD and other scores and synthesize practical clinical guidance with appropriate caveats and citations [^114PaXKi] [^1166PeDo].

> Let me first confirm the historical context and original purpose, because anchoring the score correctly prevents misapplication. The Child-Turcotte score was developed in 1964 to stratify surgical risk in portal hypertension, and Pugh's 1973 modification replaced nutritional status with prothrombin time (now INR), yielding the five-parameter Child-Pugh score that has since been widely adopted for prognostication in cirrhosis, even though it was not originally designed as a universal mortality score [^114PaXKi] [^113e17NY].

> I need to check the exact components and scoring to avoid transcription errors. The Child-Pugh score comprises five variables: total bilirubin, serum albumin, INR, severity of ascites, and grade of hepatic encephalopathy, each scored 1 to 3 points, with higher points indicating worse dysfunction; the total ranges from 5 to 15 and is then classified into classes A, B, and C, which aligns with the canonical formulation used in contemporary guidance and oncology literature [^112DADbk] [^115wrskb].

> Wait, let me verify the scoring thresholds so I don't propagate outdated cutoffs. For bilirubin, 1 point is less than 2 mg/dL, 2 points is 2–3 mg/dL, and 3 points is greater than 3 mg/dL; for albumin, 1 point is greater than 3.5 g/dL, 2 points is 2.8–3.5 g/dL, and 3 points is less than 2.8 g/dL; for INR, 1 point is less than 1.7, 2 points is 1.7–2.2, and 3 points is greater than 2.2; ascites is scored as absent, slight, or moderate; and encephalopathy is scored as none, grade 1–2, or grade 3–4, consistent with the original modification and modern summaries [^115wrskb].

> Hold on, I should verify the class definitions and reconcile mortality estimates, because sources differ. Class A is 5–6 points, Class B is 7–9 points, and Class C is 10–15 points; some historical summaries cite perioperative mortality of roughly 10% for A, 30% for B, and 80% for C, whereas others report higher figures such as 29% for A, 38% for B, and 88% for C, underscoring that these estimates vary by cohort, era, and procedure mix; clinically, the consistent message is that risk rises substantially with higher classes, and contemporary surgical guidance uses CTP alongside other tools rather than relying on CTP alone [^115wrskb] [^1166PeDo] [^11598rSQ].

> Next, I should review validated clinical applications so I don't overgeneralize. For surgical risk stratification, expert guidance recommends using CTP with MELD or other validated calculators and reserving elective surgery for Child-Pugh A when feasible, proceeding cautiously in selected Child-Pugh B patients, and generally avoiding elective procedures in Child-Pugh C; specific thresholds such as CTP > 10 or MELD > 20 flag high risk and prompt transplant evaluation or nonoperative strategies when possible [^1166PeDo] [^11598rSQ] [^114WiezT].

> I will now examine hepatocellular carcinoma, where CTP remains embedded in staging and treatment selection. The BCLC framework integrates CTP class to guide resection, ablation, TACE, systemic therapy, and transplant decisions, and major guidelines endorse using CTP and/or ALBI to assess hepatic reserve in HCC, acknowledging that ALBI's objective bilirubin and albumin components can mitigate the subjectivity of CTP grading in some contexts [^114PaXKi] [^115Ve1DF] [^1142myA3].

> Let me consider acute variceal bleeding, because early TIPS decisions hinge on severity stratification. High-risk patients are typically those with Child-Pugh C or Child-Pugh B with active bleeding, and preemptive TIPS within 72 hours improves 1-year survival in these strata; external validation also supports MELD ≥ 19 or Child-Pugh C with creatinine ≥ 1 mg/dL as high-risk criteria, refining selection beyond CTP alone [^1124ptga] [^116hMVhB] [^111SNCCa].

> I should confirm transplant-related uses and limitations. Historically, CTP informed surgical risk and waitlist prioritization, but organ allocation has shifted to MELD-based systems; nonetheless, CTP remains useful for bedside severity description and risk communication, and some contemporary cohorts still find CTP informative for waitlist mortality, albeit with moderate discrimination compared with MELD-based models [^116Cu5E3] [^116dUG6a].

> But wait, what about drug dosing and antiviral eligibility — does CTP still govern this? Yes, for hepatically metabolized agents, including antiretrovirals and HCV DAAs, dosing and eligibility often hinge on Child-Pugh class, with class B or C typically prompting specialist input and dose adjustments or contraindications, reflecting impaired clearance and increased toxicity risk [^111oj74f] [^116GtydU].

> I need to ensure I articulate limitations clearly, because overreliance on CTP can mislead. The ascites and encephalopathy components are subjective and prone to interobserver variability, the three-tier classification compresses continuous risk, and the score does not incorporate renal function, which is a major prognostic driver; these constraints motivate complementary use of MELD, MELD-Na, or disease-specific tools in decompensation and ICU settings [^113m84jc] [^116ozGdt].

> Let me compare with MELD and related scores so I don't overstate CTP's role. MELD uses bilirubin, INR, and creatinine and is continuous, enabling finer risk stratification and transplant prioritization; MELD-Na adds sodium to improve short-term mortality prediction, and MELD 3.0 further refines calibration; in acute decompensation and ACLF, CLIF-C AD and CLIF-C ACLF outperform CTP and MELD for 28–90 day mortality, while in compensated cirrhosis, ALBI provides an objective, bilirubin–albumin–based alternative that can outperform CTP in some prognostic contexts [^114Jrd3p] [^113nhVey] [^113AVroJ] [^1142myA3].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought CTP might be uniformly inferior to MELD for all short-term endpoints; hold on, I should verify that nuance. In some settings, such as 6-month mortality in mixed cirrhosis cohorts, CTP performs comparably to MELD, whereas MELD tends to excel in decompensated disease and TIPS populations; thus, the optimal score depends on the clinical phenotype and endpoint, reinforcing the principle of using multiple complementary tools rather than a single score [^113dRmEN] [^116KXk4j] [^113e17NY].

> Next, I should review practical clinical guidance so the reasoning is actionable. For elective surgery, combine CTP with MELD and procedure-specific risk models, optimize decompensation, and involve transplant-capable teams early when risk is high; for HCC, assess hepatic reserve with CTP and consider ALBI to refine within-class heterogeneity; for variceal bleeding, apply validated early TIPS criteria incorporating CTP class and active bleeding or MELD thresholds; for drug dosing, align with CTP class–based restrictions and consult hepatology; and for longitudinal care, reassess CTP at sentinel events while integrating MELD-Na and clinical frailty to inform prognosis and goals-of-care discussions [^114WiezT] [^115Ve1DF] [^1124ptga] [^111oj74f] [^116ozGdt].

> In summary, I should double-check that my synthesis preserves both the enduring utility and the recognized limits of CTP. The Child-Pugh score remains a simple, widely used bedside tool that captures synthetic and clinical decompensation features, guides surgical, oncologic, and pharmacologic decisions, and communicates severity effectively; however, its subjective components, categorical granularity, and omission of renal function necessitate pairing with MELD-based systems and disease-specific scores to optimize prognostication and individualize care across the spectrum of cirrhosis phenotypes [^114PaXKi] [^1166PeDo] [^113nhVey].

---

The Child-Pugh score is a **five-component clinical tool** (bilirubin, albumin, INR, ascites, encephalopathy) that stratifies cirrhosis severity into classes A–C, correlating with prognosis and guiding treatment decisions [^114PaXKi]. It is **most useful for surgical risk assessment** [^1166PeDo], HCC management [^115Ve1DF], and variceal bleeding risk stratification [^113k2fEM], but its subjective elements and limited discrimination in advanced disease limit its use; MELD or MELD-Na are preferred for transplant prioritization and broader prognostication [^114Jrd3p] [^113e17NY].

---

## Components and scoring system

The Child-Pugh score comprises **five parameters**, each scored 1–3 points, with higher scores indicating greater severity:

| **Parameter** | **Score 1 (mild)** | **Score 2 (moderate)** | **Score 3 (severe)** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Total bilirubin (mg/dL) | < 2 | 2–3 | > 3 |
| Serum albumin (g/dL) | > 3.5 | 2.8–3.5 | < 2.8 |
| INR | < 1.7 | 1.7–2.2 | > 2.2 |
| Ascites | None | Mild (controlled) | Moderate/severe (refractory) |
| Hepatic encephalopathy | None | Grade 1–2 | Grade 3–4 |

---

Total scores are classified as **Class A (5–6), Class B (7–9), or Class C (10–15)** [^112DADbk], reflecting increasing severity and worse prognosis [^114PaXKi].

---

## Clinical applications

The Child-Pugh score is widely used in clinical practice for **risk stratification and decision-making**:

- **Surgical risk assessment**: Helps determine perioperative risk and feasibility of surgical interventions in patients with cirrhosis [^1166PeDo] [^114WiezT].
- **Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) management**: Guides treatment selection, including surgical resection, liver transplantation, and systemic therapy [^115Ve1DF] [^112DADbk].
- **Variceal bleeding risk stratification**: Identifies patients at high risk of variceal bleeding and informs prophylactic strategies [^113k2fEM] [^116hMVhB].
- **Prognostic assessment**: Provides an estimate of long-term survival and prognosis in patients with cirrhosis [^114PaXKi] [^113e17NY].

---

## Limitations

Despite its widespread use, the Child-Pugh score has several **limitations**:

- **Subjective components**: Ascites and hepatic encephalopathy grading are subjective, leading to inter-observer variability [^113m84jc] [^114w9r2F].
- **Limited discrimination**: The score has limited ability to distinguish between patients with advanced liver disease, particularly in Class C [^113e17NY].
- **Lack of renal function assessment**: The score does not include renal function, which is a critical prognostic factor in cirrhosis [^113m84jc] [^116wBYky].

---

## Comparison with other scoring systems

The Child-Pugh score is often compared with the **Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score**, which includes bilirubin, INR, and creatinine, and is widely used for liver transplant prioritization [^114Jrd3p]. MELD is considered more objective and accurate for **predicting short-term mortality**, particularly in patients with decompensated cirrhosis [^113e17NY] [^116KXk4j]. However, the Child-Pugh score remains valuable for its simplicity and clinical utility in specific scenarios, such as surgical risk assessment and **HCC management** [^1166PeDo] [^115Ve1DF].

---

## Recent modifications and alternative scoring systems

Recent efforts have focused on improving the Child-Pugh score by incorporating additional objective parameters, such as renal function and serum sodium, resulting in modified versions like the MELD-Na score [^113e17NY]. Alternative scoring systems, such as the albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) score, have also been developed to provide more objective assessments of liver function, particularly in patients with HCC [^1142myA3] [^112DADbk].

---

The Child-Pugh score remains a **widely used clinical tool** for assessing the severity of liver cirrhosis, guiding treatment decisions, and predicting prognosis. While it has limitations, particularly regarding subjective components and limited discrimination in advanced disease, it continues to be valuable in specific clinical scenarios. Recent modifications and alternative scoring systems aim to address these limitations and improve prognostic accuracy.

Child–Pugh score

In 1964, the CHILD score was developed as a stratification tool for surgical risk in patients with liver cirrhosis. Bilirubin, albumin, ascites size, encephalopathy grade, and nutritional status were empirically selected based on observed association. The qualitative variables, ascites, encephalopathy, and nutritional status were each stratified into three groups based on severity, whilst continuous variables, bilirubin, and albumin were stratified by empiric selection of cut-off values. This enabled the manufacturing of a score between 5 and 15 for each patient. However, literature regarding surgical risk during this period did not support malnutrition as an independent predictor of survival. The Child–Pugh score (CPS) was subsequently proposed in 1973, wherein nutritional status was replaced with prothrombin time. On the surface, the score now effectively represented synthetic (albumin, international normalised ratio (INR)) and metabolic (bilirubin, encephalopathy) functions of the liver, with cut-off points for prothrombin time guided by clinical experience. Patients were then able to be distributed across grades of disease (A: 5–6, B: 7–9, C: 10–15) based on their total score from each of the 5 components.

The CPS was the first widely studied score for ACLD. It was initially verified for patients being evaluated for surgery for portal hypertension, with evidence that its use in selecting surgical candidates could be expanded. Small meta-analyses of patients undergoing both elective oesophageal (12 included studies) and pancreatic (8 included studies) resections found that outcomes were better for Child–Pugh A patients. However, there are no large meta-analyses examining surgical outcomes for patients based on CPS, or indeed validating it as superior to other prognostic scores. Current expert consensus in the American Gastroenterological Association guidelines suggests cautious consideration of its use as part of a pre-surgical risk assessment.

Integration of the CPS, as a measure of compensation status of ACLD, helps refine the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) strategy for treatment selection in HCC. It has been shown to be useful for guiding patient selection for surgical resection and systemic therapy, as well as established as a predictive factor for mortality following transarterial chemoembolisation (TACE). Recognising the importance of the CPS in making treatment decisions in HCC, a meta-analysis aimed at evaluating first-line treatments for patients with CPS 8 or higher is currently underway (PROSPERO, CRD42024528193).

### The unwell patient with advanced chronic liver disease: when to use each score? [^115Ta494]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

In the management of chronic liver disease, survival and prognosis are used to guide treatment decisions and discussions with patients and their caregivers. For a clinician, it is important to have appropriate tools to provide an accurate and realistic assessment of the natural course of a patient's disease. Multiple scores have been developed to model survival outcomes in advanced chronic liver disease (ACLD). The first widely utilised score, the Child–Pugh score (CPS), remains one of the preeminent models for cirrhosis despite having been developed through empirical selection of relevant variables. More recently, contemporary scores have been derived from statistical analysis for variables independently predictive of mortality: the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score has historically represented the most used alternative to the CPS. However, the landscape of ACLD has evolved since the development of these scores and will continue to change. Aetiological causes of ACLD have transitioned from predominantly viral hepatitis to alcoholic-associated liver disease and metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD). Whilst the optimal diagnostic criteria for steatotic liver disease remain unclear, extended definitions now include patients that may not have been considered to have liver disease when index scores were derived. ACLD may also manifest in a variety of phenotypes including acute decompensations (AD) of ACLD, acute on chronic liver failure (ACLF), stable ACLD in patients awaiting orthotopic liver transplant (OLT) and those with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). There are varied outcomes for each of these conditions. Moreover, the collective understanding of ACLF is incomplete, with a unifying definition not yet established. The advancement of contemporary understanding of ACLD requires re-assessment of prognostic tools. The aim of this review is to summarise, appraise, and compare current scores assessing disease in ACLD and highlight when each may be most useful.

### AGA clinical practice update on surgical risk assessment and perioperative management in cirrhosis: expert review [^1166PeDo]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2019). High credibility.

Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) score and American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classification — In general, patients with Child-Pugh class A cirrhosis may undergo surgery in the absence of thrombocytopenia or clinically significant portal hypertension; only selected patients with Child-Pugh class B cirrhosis are elective surgical candidates; and patients with Child-Pugh class C cirrhosis are not considered candidates for elective surgery. The presence of ascites, especially massive ascites, correlates with poor surgical outcomes, and when severe portal hypertension is present with preserved hepatic synthetic function, the CTP score may be a more useful tool. The ASA physical classification system has been used since the early 1940s to gauge risk related to anesthesia, but it is generally thought of as a measure of comorbidity or disease severity rather than a direct predictor of outcome, suffers from poor interobserver variability, and lacks a category for moderate disease; despite these weaknesses, it is used widely for risk stratification before invasive procedures and has been studied as a predictive factor in patients with cirrhosis.

Best practice advice for operative risk stratification in cirrhosis — Patients with cirrhosis are at increased risk of death after all invasive surgical procedures compared with the healthy general population, so in patients considered for surgery, use the CTP score (Child-Pugh class), MELD score, Mayo Postoperative Mortality Risk Score, or another validated risk stratification system, and because there is no single definitive risk stratification system to determine operative risk in all patients with cirrhosis, we recommend using more than one. The type and anatomic site of the proposed surgical procedure are important in risk stratification, surgical risk is continuous with no absolute cutoff values that preclude procedures, and patients should be referred to a surgical team with experience in the care of patients with cirrhosis and portal hypertension whenever feasible. Patients with Child-Pugh class C (CTP score > 10) or a MELD score > 20 pose a high risk of postoperative decompensation and death. Avoid or delay until after liver transplantation, if possible, all but the most urgent and life-saving procedures in this population.

### ACG clinical guideline: perioperative risk assessment and management in patients with cirrhosis [^114vo2o8]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Figure 1 — Preoperative assessment in cirrhosis directs clinicians to "Identify CSPH through cross-sectional imaging and/or measurement of liver stiffness and platelet count", determine if "CSPH ruled in?", and for decompensated disease "Ensure that decompensation management is optimized (e.g. HE, ascites, variceal prophylaxis, SBP prophylaxis as indicated)". The algorithm then says to "Ensure patient is up-to-date with routine cirrhosis care (e.g., liver cancer screening, varices surveillance, etc.)" and to "Compute cirrhosis-specific surgical risk scores: - MELD - Child-Turcotte-Pugh - Mayo Risk Score - VOCAL Penn Score". Risk is stratified by " > 15% predicted mortality risk through 90 days?", prompting to "Consider preoperative liver transplant evaluation" if yes, or proceed to "Prognostic discussion with patient and care team Shared decision-making regarding surgery", classifying outcomes as "Prohibitive risk" leading to "Nonoperative management" or "Acceptable risk".

### Comparison and improvement of MELD and Child-Pugh score accuracies for the prediction of 6-month mortality in cirrhotic patients [^113dRmEN]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2009). Low credibility.

Background/Goals

Superiority of the model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) over the Child-Pugh score for the prediction of outcome in patients with chronic liver disease is still debated. The main objective of this prospective study was to evaluate the accuracy of the Child-Pugh score, the MELD, and the new score, MELD-Na, combining MELD and serum sodium (Na), for the prediction of 6-month mortality in cirrhotic patients.

Study

In all, 308 consecutive cirrhotic patients were included. Child-Pugh score, MELD, and MELD-Na were calculated at the inclusion.

Results

In all, 154 patients (50.0%) had decompensated cirrhosis. Forty-five patients died during the 6-month follow-up: 3 in the subgroup of compensated cirrhosis and 42 in the decompensated subgroup (1.9% vs. 27.3%, P < 10⁻³). Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for the prediction of 6-month mortality of Child-Pugh score, MELD, and MELD-Na were, respectively, in the whole population: 0.882, 0.866, and 0.887 (P = NS), and in the subgroup of decompensated cirrhosis: 0.796, 0.800, and 0.833 (P = NS). MELD-Na had the highest accuracy but the difference reached statistical significance only with the Child-Pugh score in the subgroup of patients with decompensated cirrhosis (79.9% vs. 68.0%, P = 0.006). The combination of Child-Pugh score or MELD with other variables reflecting the circulatory dysfunction observed in end-stage liver disease significantly improved the accuracy of these 2 models.

Conclusions

Child-Pugh score remains a simple and effective tool for the prognostic assessment of cirrhotic patients at bedside and can still be used in clinical practice. MELD, and especially MELD-Na, should be reserved for patients with decompensated cirrhosis.

### Systematic review and meta-analysis of biomarkers predicting decompensation in patients with compensated cirrhosis [^117MhE2L]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Given that decompensation heralds a pivotal change in the disease trajectory of cirrhosis, there is an urgent unmet need to discover biomarkers that can predict its occurrence, in order to help prevent its onset. The ideal biomarker should demonstrate biological plausibility, high sensitivity and specificity, generalisability, undergo validation, be minimally invasive as well as easy to measure, demonstrate stability, and crucially, for healthcare services be affordable. When performing biomarker research, it is imperative to use appropriate terminology, and while addressing prediction of decompensation, one is actually referring to prognostic biomarkers which identify the likelihood of a clinical event or disease progression.

While liver disease scoring systems have been developed over time, such as the Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CP) Score and Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD), they have generally focused on predicting mortality as opposed to decompensation, and often underperform in contexts other than those in which they were initially developed. While a range of other prognostic biomarkers have emerged over recent years, few have been incorporated into clinical practice. This is likely due to a lack of clarity over which biomarkers are truly superior, whether they actually outperform existing scores and the high heterogenicity in published studies.

The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to identify which biomarkers have the strongest evidence for determining future decompensation in compensated cirrhosis, to help guide future research and highlight potential therapeutic targets.

### Timing of endoscopy in patients with acute variceal bleeding in cirrhosis: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis [^115ZYnjd]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

The Child-Pugh score and MELD score are widely used to assess the prognosis of patients with cirrhosis. Among the studies included in our analysis, 3 performed risk stratification based on the severity of liver disease (as measured by MELD or Child-Pugh score) at admission. Huh et al. found that in patients with a MELD score ≤ 17, urgent endoscopy was associated with higher mortality and rebleeding. Zhang et al. reported that in Child-Pugh B patients, urgent endoscopy could lead to a higher incidence of rebleeding. However, the study by Peng et al. which defined endoscopy timing as the interval between admission and endoscopy, found no significant correlation between endoscopy timing and mortality or rebleeding at different Child-Pugh scores. We extracted Child-Pugh and MELD scores for the urgent and early endoscopy groups from the included studies. Subgroup analyses combined all studies reporting these risk factors and revealed no significant correlation between the time to endoscopy and the severity of liver disease. As more than 5 studies identified the severity of liver disease at admission as an independent risk factor for the primary outcomes, we performed meta-regression analysis on studies reporting Child-Pugh scores or MELD scores for the urgent and early endoscopy groups with their mortality and rebleeding. These analyses suggested that only Child-Pugh scores was significantly associated with the risk of overall mortality. We synthesized the available data, but due to the limited number of studies providing this specific information and inconsistencies in data reporting formats, these conclusions should be interpreted with caution.

Cirrhosis and Child-Pugh assessment — patients with cirrhosis should be evaluated for signs of liver decompensation according to the Child-Turcotte-Pugh classification system, and all patients with Child-Pugh class B or C disease should be evaluated by an expert in advanced liver disease and considered for liver transplantation. Furthermore, hepatically metabolized antiretroviral (ARV) and HCV direct-acting antiviral (DAA) drugs may be contraindicated or require dose modification in patients with Child-Pugh class B and C disease.

### Transection of the oesophagus for bleeding oesophageal varices [^115wrskb]. The British Journal of Surgery (1973). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "Child-Pugh score for mortality in liver cirrhosis" for liver cirrhosis, hepatitis C virus infection, hepatitis B virus infection, portal hypertension, ascites, variceal hemorrhage and hepatitis D virus infection.

The Child-Pugh score is a clinical tool designed for assessing the prognosis of chronic liver disease, primarily cirrhosis. It is particularly useful in predicting mortality rates in patients with liver cirrhosis, aiding in clinical decision-making and patient counseling.

The score is determined by five primary components: total bilirubin, albumin, international normalized ratio (INR), ascites, and encephalopathy. Each component is assigned a score of 1 to 3 based on the severity of the patient's condition.

Total bilirubin, albumin, and INR are biochemical markers reflecting liver function. Higher bilirubin and INR or lower albumin levels indicate more severe liver dysfunction and receive higher scores. Ascites and encephalopathy are clinical manifestations of liver disease. The presence and severity of these conditions also contribute to the overall score.

The sum of these scores is used to classify patients into three risk classes: Class A (score ≤ 6), Class B (score 7–9), and Class C (score ≥ 10). Each class corresponds to a different risk of perioperative mortality, with Class A having the lowest risk (29%) and Class C the highest (88%).

The Child-Pugh score, therefore, provides a quantitative measure of disease severity in liver cirrhosis, helping clinicians to stratify risk and guide treatment decisions.

The Child-Pugh score is a clinical tool used to assess the severity of liver cirrhosis and predict perioperative mortality risk by evaluating five key parameters. These parameters are total bilirubin, albumin level, international normalized ratio (INR), presence of ascites, and degree of hepatic encephalopathy. Each parameter is assigned a score of 1 to 3, with higher scores indicating greater severity.

Here's how the scoring works:

- **Total bilirubin**

- Less than 2 mg/dL (34.2 mcmol/L) = 1 point
- Between 2 and 3 mg/dL (34.2–51.3 mcmol/L) = 2 points
- Greater than 3 mg/dL (51.3 mcmol/L) = 3 points

- **Albumin**

- Greater than 3.5 g/dL (35 g/L) = 1 point
- Between 2.8 and 3.5 g/dL (28–35 g/L) = 2 points
- Less than 2.8 g/dL (28 g/L) = 3 points

- **INR**

- Less than 1.7 = 1 point
- Between 1.7 and 2.2 = 2 points
- Greater than 2.2 = 3 points

- **Ascites**

- Absent = 1 point
- Slight = 2 points
- Moderate = 3 points

- **Encephalopathy**

- No encephalopathy = 1 point
- Grade 1–2 = 2 points
- Grade 3–4 = 3 points

The total Child-Pugh score is the sum of all points from the five categories, resulting in a score that ranges from 5 to 15. The score is then interpreted to determine the class and associated risk:

- A total score of 5 or 6 falls within Class A, where the risk of perioperative mortality is estimated to be 29%.
- Scores ranging from 7 to 9 correspond to Class B, which carries a 38% risk of perioperative mortality.
- A score of 10 or higher is categorized as Class C, indicating a high risk of perioperative mortality at 88%.

This systematic approach enables healthcare providers to evaluate the severity of liver disease and make informed medical decisions based on the patient's risk profile.

### Transient elastography can stratify patients with Child-Pugh A cirrhosis according to risk of early decompensation [^1148FFhY]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Compensated cirrhosis has a variable prognosis depending on stage. There are currently no straightforward and robust tools in clinical practice to predict decompensation in Child-Pugh A cirrhosis. We set out to determine whether transient elastography (TE) could be used across liver disease aetiologies to determine risk of decompensation.

Patients and Methods

Participants were enrolled at two sites (Dublin and Nottingham) and followed up for a minimum of 2 years. The primary outcome of the study was liver decompensation, defined as the development of overt hepatic encephalopathy or ascites or presentation with bleeding varices. All patients received a TE examination to measure liver stiffness measurement (LSM) and had routine blood measurements taken at the baseline visit and on each subsequent visit.

Results

In 259 participants, the overall rate of liver-related outcome was 31 per 1000 person-years (95% confidence interval: 19–47 per 1000 person-years). Of the total population, 6 and 11% developed a liver-related outcome within 2 and 4 years of follow-up, respectively. There were no events in the population with a LSM less than 21kPa. A LSM of more than 35kPa was associated with a decompensation risk of 39% at 4 years. For each unit increase in the LSM above 20kPa, the risk of liver-related outcome increased by 6% (hazard ratio = 1.06; 95% confidence interval: 1.04–1.82) after adjusting for age, sex Mayo End Liver Disease Score, cohort source and aetiology.

Conclusion

The risk of liver decompensation increased with increasing LSM in mixed aetiology compensated cirrhosis. LSM may be used to risk stratify patients, potentially reassure patients with low scores, and select patients with higher scores for experimental therapeutic studies with acceptable timelines.

### Predictors of clinical outcomes in cirrhosis patients [^1166EQV2]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The current review aims to explain the different systems available to clinicians for predicting clinical outcomes in patients with cirrhosis.

Recent Findings

Cirrhosis is the final stage of chronic liver disease and is associated with high morbidity and mortality. The most commonly utilized tools to predict outcomes in patients with cirrhosis include the following: assessing severity of portal hypertension using hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) measurements, using scoring systems such as the Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) and Child-Pugh-Turcotte (CPT) scores, and recently, clinical staging systems based on cirrhosis-related clinical complications. Assessing portal pressure with HVPG measurements provides valuable prognostic information, yet is costly, time-consuming, and invasive. MELD and CPT scores can be calculated quickly and not only assess liver function, but also yield predictive information. However, they represent only one point in time, and do not take into account the full clinical picture. Clinical staging systems have traditionally been focused on compensated and decompensated stages, with newer models assessing the influence of cirrhosis-related complications. However, these are not commonly utilized.

Summary

Predicting clinical outcomes in patients with cirrhosis is challenging, and is likely best accomplished with a combination of objective data (such as MELD and HVPG provide) in addition to the clinical course of cirrhosis.

### ACG clinical guideline: perioperative risk assessment and management in patients with cirrhosis [^114WiezT]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

ACG Clinical Guideline — Key concepts: overall perioperative risk stratification in cirrhosis — Comprehensive evaluation of surgical risk in patients with cirrhosis requires consideration of liver-related factors, non–liver-related comorbidities, and surgery-specific factors, and individualized estimation is best accomplished by combining validated cirrhosis-specific surgical risk calculators with clinical judgement and individual patient circumstances. In conjunction with clinical judgment, cirrhosis-specific risk scores including the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD), Childs-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP), Mayo, and VOCAL-Penn Score are useful to estimate operative risk, and nonhepatic comorbid conditions require independent assessment. In patients with known liver disease but unknown fibrosis stage, FIB-4 and/or elastography may be used to identify advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis, and patients with very low MELD (6–9) and CTP (5–6) scores and no evidence of clinically significant portal hypertension or hepatic decompensation have limited excess risk of adverse surgical events; preoperative assessment of frailty may help to inform surgical risk.

### AGA clinical practice update on palliative care management in cirrhosis: expert review [^116ozGdt]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2021). High credibility.

AGA Clinical Practice Update — prognostication in cirrhosis emphasizes routine and event-triggered assessment and notes limits of common scores with communication aids to discuss prognosis. BPA 6: Prognosis should be evaluated by gastroenterology/hepatology providers during routine care visits and at sentinel events. Population-based prognostic scores such as MELD, the MELD sodium, the Child-Pugh classification, and the CLIF-C Acute-on-Chronic Liver Failure score have recognized limitations when applied to individual patients, and a more complete understanding can include comorbidities, functional status/frailty, the rapidity of decline, and potential for improvement with etiological therapy. The text notes clinicians remain overly optimistic and cites multicenter data where physicians and models failed to predict mortality, and suggests using conversation prompts, including from the Serious Illness Conversation Guide, such as "Is this okay with you?".

### Comparative evaluation of ALBI, MELD, and Child-Pugh scores in prognosis of cirrhosis: is ALBI the new alternative? [^116veDf3]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The existence of reliable prognostic indices is of paramount importance in the management of cirrhosis. The Child-Pugh (CP) score has been used for more than 40 years. It was initially proposed to assess the outcomes of cirrhotic patients after surgery for portal hypertension and gradually gained wider acceptance. Two modified types of CP score encompassing serum creatinine have also been evaluated. The model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score was first applied to patients undergoing transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts, but since 2002 it has been used for assessing candidates for liver transplantation. MELD-Na, a modified MELD score incorporating serum sodium, has been used for survival prediction, taking account of the significance of hyponatremia in early mortality from cirrhosis.

The albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) score is a recently proposed and very simple score that evaluates only 2 objective parameters that are readily available for every cirrhotic patient. The ALBI score has been reported to assess liver dysfunction and prognosis in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, in patients with primary biliary cholangitis, in cirrhotic patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding, and in various hepatitis-B virus-related liver diseases. However, its usefulness in assessing a cirrhotic cohort of patients has not been adequately evaluated.

The aim of this study was to compare the prognostic accuracy of ALBI, platelet-albumin-bilirubin (PALBI), MELD, MELD-Na, CP, and CP corrected for creatinine scores in a genetically homogeneous Cretan cirrhotic population.

### The unwell patient with advanced chronic liver disease: when to use each score? [^112xM92j]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Prognostication in chronic liver disease and the implementation of appropriate scoring systems is difficult given the variety of clinical manifestations. It is important to understand the limitations of each scoring system as well as the context and patient group from which it was developed to allow appropriate application. This review seeks to explore the optimal clinical uses of different predictive scores developed for compensated and decompensated chronic liver disease, acute on chronic liver failure, and hepatocellular carcinoma. We will also review future areas of research for each score and current gaps in the literature.

Main Body

The Child-Pugh score is the pre-eminent prediction score for liver disease that was developed through empiric selection of relevant variables. It is useful for selection of patients for surgical resection of hepatocellular carcinoma but is inferior to other scores for other clinically relevant endpoints such as survival in acute decompensations. The Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score and subsequent variants (MELD-Na, MELD 3.0) were developed to predict mortality following elective transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) insertion. An alternative is the Frieberg Index of Post-TIPS Survival (FIPS) score, which has been externally validated for TIPS populations. Organ allocation for liver transplantation is also currently prioritised using the MELD score, with the MELD 3.0 reducing waitlist gender discrepancies. The Chronic Liver Failure Consortium (CLIF-C) acute decompensation (AD) and acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) scores are used for predicting mortality in cirrhotic patients with acute decompensation of liver disease and acute-on-chronic liver failure, respectively. Both scores were developed from retrospective analyses of an observational European cohort with external validation. Understanding of ACLF presentation of advanced liver disease remains in the preliminary stages. Improving collective understanding is important to optimise prognostication. The albumin-bilirubin score is a non-invasive predictor of survival in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Incorporating artificial intelligence to personalise predictive algorithms may provide the most effective prognostication for all clinical phenotypes.

Conclusion

We summarised key prognostic scores used in advanced liver disease and make recommendations for the optimal uses. Nuances in the development and implementation of each are discussed to help guide effective use.

### A comparison of child-pugh, APACHE II and APACHE III scoring systems in predicting hospital mortality of patients with liver cirrhosis [^113SWfiJ]. BMC Gastroenterology (2003). Low credibility.

Background

The aim of this study was to assess the prognostic accuracy of Child-Pugh and APACHE II and III scoring systems in predicting short-term, hospital mortality of patients with liver cirrhosis.

Methods

200 admissions of 147 cirrhotic patients (44% viral-associated liver cirrhosis, 33% alcoholic, 18.5% cryptogenic, 4.5% both viral and alcoholic) were studied prospectively. Clinical and laboratory data conforming to the Child-Pugh, APACHE II and III scores were recorded on day 1 for all patients. Discrimination was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and area under a ROC curve (AUC). Calibration was estimated using the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test.

Results

Overall mortality was 11.5%. The mean Child-Pugh, APACHE II and III scores for survivors were found to be significantly lower than those of nonsurvivors. Discrimination was excellent for Child-Pugh (ROC AUC: 0.859) and APACHE III (ROC AUC: 0.816) scores, and acceptable for APACHE II score (ROC AUC: 0.759). Although the Hosmer-Lemeshow statistic revealed adequate goodness-of-fit for Child-Pugh score (P = 0.192), this was not the case for APACHE II and III scores (P = 0.004 and 0.003 respectively)

Conclusion

Our results indicate that, of the three models, Child-Pugh score had the least statistically significant discrepancy between predicted and observed mortality across the strata of increasing predicting mortality. This supports the hypothesis that APACHE scores do not work accurately outside ICU settings.

### Short-term prognosis in critically ill patients with cirrhosis assessed by prognostic scoring systems [^11191zz6]. Hepatology (2001). Low credibility.

The short-term prognosis of acutely ill patients with cirrhosis is influenced by the degree of hepatic insufficiency and by dysfunction of extrahepatic organ systems. The purpose of this study was to assess and compare the prognostic accuracy of the Child-Pugh classification, the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II system and the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) for predicting hospital mortality in patients with cirrhosis when used 24 hours after admission to a medical intensive care unit (ICU). Prospective data were recorded on 143 patients. Cumulative mortality rates were 36% in the ICU, 46% in the hospital, and 56% at 6-month follow-up. By using the area under receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curves, the SOFA showed an excellent discriminative power (AUROC 0.94), which was clearly superior to the APACHE II (AUROC 0.79) and the Child-Pugh system (AUROC 0.74). Hospital mortality rates below and above a cutoff of 8 SOFA points were 4% and 88%, respectively (P < .0005). The SOFA score also reflected resource use during the ICU treatment as measured by daily workload and length of stay. The SOFA is an easily applied tool with excellent prognostic abilities and can be used to enhance clinical judgment of prognosis as well as providing patients and families with objective information.

### Comparative evaluation of ALBI, MELD, and Child-Pugh scores in prognosis of cirrhosis: is ALBI the new alternative? [^114djf28]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study suggests that the ALBI score has a prognostic accuracy similar to that of other established scores for mortality prediction in cirrhosis. These data, if validated in larger studies, may be of significant clinical importance in view of the simplicity of this score.

The CP score has been proposed as a reliable prognostic score in cirrhosis in many systematic reviews, but its subjective components (ascites and encephalopathy) still remain a matter of doubt. A systematic review of prognostic indicators in cirrhosis in 118 studies showed that serum albumin and bilirubin were the 2 most significant prognostic variables for survival.

A study by Chen et al assessed the accuracy of ALBI in predicting 1-, 2-, and 3- year mortality in patients with hepatitis B-related cirrhosis, and ROC curves showed that the ALBI score (AUC 0.787, 0.830, and 0.833) was superior to the MELD (0.693, P = 0.003; 0.717, P < 0.001; 0.744, P < 0.001) and CP (0.641, P < 0.001; 0.649, P < 0.001; 0.657, P < 0.001) scores. In our study, in agreement with Chen et al, ROC analysis showed that the ALBI score was better at predicting mortality compared to MELD, MELD-Na, CP, CP-I and CP-II scores. Moreover, in the aforementioned study the multivariate analysis found ALBI score and age to be independent factors associated with mortality, in accordance with our study, while in another study that included only patients with primary biliary cholangitis the multivariate analysis also indicated that the ALBI score was the only independent prognostic factor, with an adjusted HR for developing a hepatic event of 27.8 (P < 0.001). These findings agree with our study, where ALBI, MELD-Na score, and age were all independent variables, whereas in decompensated cirrhosis only the ALBI score was an independent prognostic factor. A study by Zou et al evaluated the in-hospital mortality in relation to ALBI, CP, and MELD scores in 631 cirrhotic patients and found that the ALBI score had the best AUC (0.808, 0.785, 0.787, respectively). These studies suggest that ALBI is a good indicator of short-term prognosis, in agreement with our study, where 1-month survival was best assessed by ALBI (AUC 0.912).

### A new recalibrated four-category Child-Pugh score performs better than the original Child-Pugh and MELD scores in predicting in-hospital mortality in decompensated alcoholic cirrhotic patients with acute variceal bleeding: a real-world cohort analysis [^1142Be6Y]. World Journal of Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

There currently is no consensus on how to accurately predict early rebleeding and death after a major variceal bleed. This study investigated the relative predictive performances of the original Child-Pugh (CP), model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) and a four-category recalibrated Child-Pugh (rCP).

Methods

This prospective study included all adult patients admitted to Groote Schuur Hospital with acute esophageal variceal bleeding secondary to alcoholic cirrhosis, between January 2000 and December 2017. CP and rCP grades and MELD score were calculated on admission, and the predictive ability in discriminating in-hospital rebleeding and death was compared by area under receiver-operating characteristic (AUROC) curves.

Results

During the study period, 403 consecutive adult patients were treated for bleeding esophageal varices of whom 225 were secondary to alcoholic cirrhosis. Twenty-four (10.6%) patients were CP grade A, 88 (39.1%) grade B and 113 (50.2%) grade C on hospital admission. MELD scores ranged from 6 to 40. Thirty-one (13.8%) patients rebleed, and 41 (18.2%) patients died. There was no difference in the discriminatory capacity of the CP (AUROC 0.59, 95% CI 0.50–0.670) and MELD (AUROC 0.62, 95% CI 0.51–0.73) to predict rebleeding (p = 0.72), or between the Child-Pugh (AUROC 0.75, 95% CI 0.71–0.81) and MELD (AUROC 0.71, 95% CI 0.62–0.80) to predict death (p = 0.35). The rCP classification (A-D) had a significantly improved discriminatory capacity (AUROC 0.83 95% CI 0.77–0.89) compared to the CP score (A-C) and MELD to predict death (p = 0.004).

Conclusion

A recalibrated Child-Pugh score outperforms the original Child-Pugh grade and MELD score in predicting in-hospital death in patients with bleeding esophageal varices secondary to alcoholic cirrhosis.

### British society of gastroenterology best practice guidance: outpatient management of cirrhosis-part 1: compensated cirrhosis [^116RrfDX]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Liver disease and liver cancer together caused 2.5% of deaths in England in 2018. Over half of these deaths occur in those of working age. Liver-related deaths have increased by over 400% since 1970, and the number of hospital admissions for liver disease has increased by half over the last decade. Following the COVID-19 pandemic, premature mortality from all major causes of liver disease increased further in 2020, with mortality highest in the most deprived areas. Good outpatient management is crucial in preventing hospital admissions and keeping people living with cirrhosis well.

Cirrhosis is defined by widespread disruption of normal liver structure by fibrosis, caused by chronic progressive conditions affecting the liver; most commonly alcohol-related steatotic liver disease (ALD), followed by metabolic dysfunction associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) (previously termed non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)). The diagnosis is generally made based on one, or a combination, of clinical findings, imaging, endoscopy, non-invasive tests (such as enhanced liver fibrosis test or transient elastography (TE)) and/or histology.

An asymptomatic compensated phase is followed, in the presence of ongoing liver damage, by a decompensated phase, marked by the development of overt clinical signs, most frequently ascites, bleeding, encephalopathy and jaundice. The Baveno group have developed a six-stage model of cirrhosis, reflecting the degree of portal hypertension (see figure 1). Mortality in the compensated phase (stages 0–2), a median of 10-year duration, is 1%, compared with 40%, 65% and 80% at 1, 2 and 5 years, respectively, for those progressing to decompensated cirrhosis. The Child-Pugh class (A–C)is referred to in parts of this guidance. While initially developed to estimate postoperative mortality, Child-Pugh score (5–15) and associated class are widely used to describe the severity of liver disease and are associated with prognosis. Child-Pugh class A and Child-Pugh class C indicate compensated and decompensated cirrhosis, respectively. Patients with Child-Pugh B cirrhosis may have compensated or decompensated disease. More recently developed scores such as the Model for End Stage Liver Disease (MELD)and UK Model for End Stage Liver Disease (UKELD)provide better prognostic value and so are used to predict mortality following a range of interventions in patients with cirrhosis, as well as eligibility for liver transplant (see part 2).

### Development and performance of an algorithm to estimate the child-turcotte-pugh score from a national electronic healthcare database [^112WucZZ]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2015). Low credibility.

Background & Methods

The Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) score is a widely used and validated predictor of long-term survival in cirrhosis. The CTP score is a composite of 5 subscores, 3 based on objective clinical laboratory values and 2 subjective variables quantifying the severity of ascites and hepatic encephalopathy. To date, no system to quantify CTP score from administrative databases has been validated. The Veterans Outcomes and Costs Associated with Liver Disease study is a multicenter collaborative study to evaluate the outcomes and costs of hepatocellular carcinoma in the U.S. Veterans Health Administration. We developed and validated an algorithm to calculate electronic CTP (eCTP) scores by using data from the Veterans Health Administration Corporate Data Warehouse.

Methods

Multiple algorithms for determining each CTP subscore from International Classification of Diseases version 9, Common Procedural Terminology, pharmacy, and laboratory data were devised and tested in 2 patient cohorts. For each cohort, 6 site investigators (Boston, Bronx, Brooklyn, Philadelphia, Minneapolis, and West Haven VA Medical Centers) were provided cases from which to determine validity of diagnosis, laboratory data, and clinical assessment of ascites and encephalopathy. The optimal algorithm (designated eCTP) was then applied to 30,840 cirrhotic patients alive in the first quarter of 2008 for whom 5-year overall and transplant-free survival data were available. The ability of the eCTP score and other disease severity scores (Charlson-Deyo index, Veterans Aging Cohort Study index, Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score, and Cirrhosis Comorbidity) to predict survival was then assessed by Cox proportional hazards regression.

Results

Spearman correlations for administrative and investigator validated laboratory data in the HCC and cirrhotic cohorts, respectively, were 0.85 and 0.92 for bilirubin, 0.92 and 0.87 for albumin, and 0.84 and 0.86 for international normalized ratio. In the HCC cohort, the overall eCTP score matched 96% of patients to within 1 point of the chart-validated CTP score (Spearman correlation, 0.81). In the cirrhosis cohort, 98% were matched to within 1 point of their actual CTP score (Spearman, 0.85). When applied to a cohort of 30,840 patients with cirrhosis, each unit change in eCTP was associated with 39% increase in the relative risk of death or transplantation. The Harrell C statistic for the eCTP (0.678) was numerically higher than those for other disease severity indices for predicting 5-year transplant-free survival. Adding other predictive models to the eCTP resulted in minimal differences in its predictive performance.

Conclusion

We developed and validated an algorithm to extrapolate an eCTP score from data in a large administrative database with excellent correlation to actual CTP score on chart review. When applied to an administrative database, this algorithm is a highly useful predictor of survival when compared with multiple other published liver disease severity indices.

### AGA clinical practice update on surgical risk assessment and perioperative management in cirrhosis: expert review [^116cehta]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2019). High credibility.

AGA Clinical Practice Update — elective surgery optimization in cirrhosis — states that elective operations in patients with cirrhosis should generally be avoided until the liver disease can be optimized, that cardiology and pulmonology consultations are frequently needed for these complex patients, and that both the Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) and MELD scores are predictive of surgical outcome only in patients who are otherwise satisfactory candidates for surgery and have no other important comorbidities; for chronic viral hepatitis and autoimmune hepatitis, strict adherence to therapy is required and elective or semielective surgery may be delayed until therapy is completed, with alternative routes such as intravenous corticosteroids when oral medications are not possible.

### Assessment of prognostic performance of albumin-bilirubin, child-pugh, and model for end-stage liver disease scores in patients with liver cirrhosis complicated with acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding [^11782Snh]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

The Albumin-Bilirubin (ALBI) score was developed recently to assess the severity of liver dysfunction. We aimed to assess its prognostic performance in patients with liver cirrhosis complicated with upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) while comparing it with Child-Pugh (CP) and Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) scores.

Patients and Methods

This was a retrospective unicentric study, including consecutive adult patients with cirrhosis admitted for UGIB between January 2011 and November 2015. Clinical, analytical, and endoscopic variables were assessed and ALBI, CP, and MELD scores at admission were calculated.

Results

This study included 111 patients. During the first 30 days of follow-up, 12 (10.8%) patients died, and during the first year of follow-up, another 10 patients died (first-year mortality of 19.8%). On comparing the three scores, for in-stay and 30-day mortality, only the ALBI score showed statistically significant results, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.80 (P < 0.01) for both outcomes. For first-year mortality, AUC for ALBI, CP, and MELD scores were 0.71 (P < 0.01), 0.64 (P < 0.05), and 0.66 (P = 0.02), respectively, whereas for global mortality, AUC were 0.75 (P < 0.01), 0.72 (P < 0.01), and 0.72 (P < 0.01), respectively. On comparing the AUC of the three scores, no significant differences were found in first-year mortality and global mortality.

Conclusion

In our series, the ALBI score accurately predicted both in-stay and 30-day mortality, whereas CP and MELD scores could not predict these outcomes. All scores showed a fair prognostic prediction performance for first-year and global mortality. These results suggest that the ALBI score is particularly useful in the assessment of short-term outcomes, with a better performance than the most commonly used scores.

### Immunotherapy and cirrhosis: expanding Child-Pugh boundaries in liver cancer [^111TnP9U]. Clinical Cancer Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Immunotherapy has historically been restricted to HCC patients with well-preserved liver function, based upon safety and efficacy data established in clinical trial populations. While an immune-suppressive microenvironment coupled with comorbid cirrhosis may contribute to poorer outcomes, a subset of patients with worse degrees of liver function achieves significant clinical benefit from combination immunotherapy.

### Comparative evaluation of ALBI, MELD, and Child-Pugh scores in prognosis of cirrhosis: is ALBI the new alternative? [^112MM3rc]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Patients and methods

Data on 195 consecutive cirrhotic patients either attending the liver outpatient clinic or hospitalized in the gastroenterology wards within a 2-year period were retrospectively analyzed. The study was approved by the Institutional Ethics Review Board of the Hospital and written consent was provided by all patients. Cirrhosis was determined either by liver biopsy (52%) or by compatible imaging and clinical and endoscopic findings (esophageal varices, ascites). Cirrhosis was classified as decompensated when ascites, variceal hemorrhage or hepatic encephalopathy were recorded.

Age, sex, cause of cirrhosis, compensation status, age at diagnosis of cirrhosis, first complications of decompensated cirrhosis, existence or appearance of hepatocellular cancer, as well as biochemical variables (creatinine, total bilirubin, albumin, international normalized ratio, prothrombin time, sodium, potassium, alkaline phosphatase, γ-glutamyl transferase, transaminases) were recorded for all patients.

Patients were followed-up for a median of 27.2 months (interquartile range [IQR] 46.9, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0–105.6). Three patients were lost to follow up. Every cirrhotic patient was followed-up in our screening program for hepatocellular carcinoma, which involves undergoing an ultrasound examination every 6 months with α-fetoprotein levels and contrast-enhanced ultrasound with SonoVue every year. The CP, MELD, MELD-Na, ALBI, and PALBI scores were assessed for every patient at first examination. The PALBI score was calculated as:

PALBI = (2.02×log₁₀ bilirubin)+(-0.37×(log₁₀ bilirubin)²) +(-0.04×albumin)+(-3.48×log₁₀ platelets)+(1.01× (log₁₀ platelets)²).

### Hepatitis C guidance 2019 update: American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases-Infectious Diseases Society of America recommendations for testing, managing, and treating hepatitis C virus infection [^116GtydU]. Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

Simplified HCV treatment algorithm for treatment-naive adults with compensated cirrhosis defines eligibility, exclusions, and pretreatment assessments: The algorithm applies to persons aged ≥ 18 years who have not been previously treated and have evidence of compensated cirrhosis (Child-Turcotte-Pugh [CTP] class A) but not decompensated cirrhosis (CTP class B or C), and a CTP score ≥ 7 or any history of decompensation disqualifies these patients. Recommended pretreatment assessment includes clinical evaluation for ascites and hepatic encephalopathy and ultrasound imaging of the liver within the prior 6 months to evaluate for hepatocellular carcinoma and subclinical ascites, and any of these clinical or imaging findings are contraindications to use of the simplified treatment algorithm. Other disqualifying circumstances mirror the previous section, and medication reconciliation, assessment for potential drug–drug interactions, and pretreatment education and counseling are the same as for treatment-naive patients without cirrhosis. Pretreatment laboratory assessment includes complete blood count (CBC), INR, a hepatic function panel, and eGFR within 3 months of initiating antiviral therapy.

### Comparative evaluation of ALBI, MELD, and Child-Pugh scores in prognosis of cirrhosis: is ALBI the new alternative? [^115fQAJC]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background:

The existence of reliable prognostic indices is of paramount importance in the management of cirrhosis. Both the model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score and the older Child-Pugh (CP) scores are widely used. The albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) score, initially used in hepatocellular carcinoma, has not been thoroughly investigated in cirrhosis. The aim of this study was to compare the prognostic accuracy of ALBI, MELD, MELD with sodium (MELD-Na), CP, and the corrected for creatinine CP scores in a genetically homogeneous Cretan cirrhotic population.

Methods:

One hundred ninety-five outpatients or hospitalized cirrhotics (127 male, median age 66 years) were studied over a period of 2 years and ALBI, platelet-albumin-bilirubin, MELD, MELD-Na, CP score, and 2 types of modified CP score (CP-I and CP-II) with serum creatinine were calculated and correlated with survival.

Results:

ALBI had an optimum balance between sensitivity and specificity (area under the curve 0.704, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.630–0.778) compared to the other scores. In the multivariate analysis, the only factors independently associated with death were the ALBI score (hazard ratio [HR] 2.51, 95%CI 1.69–3.73; P < 0.001), the MELD-Na score (HR 1.04, 95%CI 1.00–1.09; P = 0.045), and age (HR 1.05, 95%CI 1.03–1.07; P < 0.001). When only decompensated cirrhosis was evaluated, the multivariate analysis showed that the ALBI score (HR 3.03; 95%CI 1.92–4.78; P < 0.001), and age (HR 1.05, 95%CI 1.03–1.07; P < 0.001) were independently associated with death.

Conclusion:

ALBI score might be a better prognostic indicator of mortality in cirrhosis and given its simplicity could substitute for the CP, MELD, and MELD-Na scores.

One hundred ninety-five outpatients or hospitalized cirrhotics (127 male, median age 66 years) were studied over a period of 2 years and ALBI, platelet-albumin-bilirubin, MELD, MELD-Na, CP score, and 2 types of modified CP score (CP-I and CP-II) with serum creatinine were calculated and correlated with survival.

Results

ALBI had an optimum balance between sensitivity and specificity (area under the curve 0.704, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.630–0.778) compared to the other scores. In the multivariate analysis, the only factors independently associated with death were the ALBI score (hazard ratio [HR] 2.51, 95%CI 1.69–3.73; P < 0.001), the MELD-Na score (HR 1.04, 95%CI 1.00–1.09; P = 0.045), and age (HR 1.05, 95%CI 1.03–1.07; P < 0.001). When only decompensated cirrhosis was evaluated, the multivariate analysis showed that the ALBI score (HR 3.03; 95%CI 1.92–4.78; P < 0.001), and age (HR 1.05, 95%CI 1.03–1.07; P < 0.001) were independently associated with death.

Conclusion

ALBI score might be a better prognostic indicator of mortality in cirrhosis and given its simplicity could substitute for the CP, MELD, and MELD-Na scores.

### AGA clinical practice update on surgical risk assessment and perioperative management in cirrhosis: expert review [^1116YG3D]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2019). High credibility.

Predicting surgical risk in a patient with cirrhosis emphasizes outcomes by preoperative risk and the primacy of liver disease severity. In cirrhotic patients undergoing surgery categorized preoperatively as American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) class V, Teh et al showed a median survival of 2 days, a 90% mortality rate at 14 days, and a 100% mortality rate at 90 days. The risk of postoperative mortality and complications is related to the degree of hepatic dysfunction, comorbidities, type of surgical procedure, and expertise of the management team, and Of these factors, the severity of the liver disease appears to be the most important factor in determining mortality risk. The severity of liver disease has traditionally been assessed in the literature by the Child–Turcotte–Pugh (CTP) score (Child–Pugh class) and the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score, and If the surgical risk is much higher than the chance of a good outcome from the perspective of the patient, then the procedure should be considered futile and avoided regardless of the patient's degree of liver disease.

### Guidance document: risk assessment of patients with cirrhosis prior to elective non-hepatic surgery [^116CaBGY]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

As a result of the increasing incidence of cirrhosis in the UK, more patients with chronic liver disease are being considered for elective non-hepatic surgery. A historical reluctance to offer surgery to such patients stems from general perceptions of poor postoperative outcomes. While this is true for those with decompensated cirrhosis, selected patients with compensated early-stage cirrhosis can have good outcomes after careful risk assessment. Well-recognised risks include those of general anaesthesia, bleeding, infections, impaired wound healing, acute kidney injury and cardiovascular compromise. Intra-abdominal or cardiothoracic surgery are particularly high-risk interventions. Clinical assessment supplemented by blood tests, imaging, liver stiffness measurement, endoscopy and assessment of portal pressure (derived from the hepatic venous pressure gradient) can facilitate risk stratification. Traditional prognostic scoring systems including the Child-Turcotte-Pugh and Model for End-stage Liver Disease are helpful but may overestimate surgical risk. Specific prognostic scores like Mayo Risk Score, VOCAL-Penn and ADOPT-LC can add precision to risk assessment. Measures to mitigate risk include careful management of varices, nutritional optimisation and where possible addressing any ongoing aetiological drivers such as alcohol consumption. The role of portal decompression such as transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunting can be considered in selected high-risk patients, but further prospective study of this approach is required. It is of paramount importance that patients are discussed in a multidisciplinary forum, and that patients are carefully counselled about potential risks and benefits.

### Comparative evaluation of ALBI, MELD, and Child-Pugh scores in prognosis of cirrhosis: is ALBI the new alternative? [^112HyRB6]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

In addition, 2 types of modified CP score (CP-I and CP-II) with serum creatinine as the sixth variable were also calculated: CP-I (range: 5–19) was derived from the original CP score by adding 0 points for creatinine < 1.3 mg/dL and 4 points for creatinine ≥ 1.3 mg/dL, according to Angermayr et al, while CP-II (range: 5–19) was derived from the original CP score by adding 0 points for creatinine < 1.3 mg/dL, 2 points for creatinine 1.3–1.8 mg/dL, and 4 points for creatinine > 1.8 mg/dL. According to the proposed cutoff points for ALBI and PALBI scores, we stratified our patients into 3 groups. For ALBI score: grade 1 (score -2.60), grade 2 (> -2.60 to -1.39), and grade 3 (> -1.39). For PALBI score: grade 1 (score ≤ -2.53), grade 2 (> -2.52 to -2.09), and grade 3 (> -2.09).

Statistical analysis

Analysis was performed using the IBM SPSS 14.0 software, with statistical significance defined at a = 0.05. All variables were checked for normality of distributions by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and the binomial test. Data were reported as mean ± standard deviation and median, IQR. Continuous variables were compared using Student's t -test, the Mann-Whitney U -test or one-way analysis of variance, as appropriate. Furthermore, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed and the area under the curve (AUC) was calculated to assess the 6 scoring systems. Survival analysis was conducted by performing a Kaplan-Meier estimate, testing for several selected parameters. Cox proportional hazard regression was performed to test the effect of other independent variables on survival times (1, 6, 12, 24 months) of different groups of patients, controlling for confounders and interaction terms.

### Clinical outcomes following DAA therapy in patients with HCV-related cirrhosis depend on disease severity [^114j7KW7]. Journal of Hepatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background & Aims

HCV-infected patients with cirrhosis achieve high sustained virological response (SVR) rates with direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) even after hepatic decompensation. We aimed to assess the clinical outcome following DAAs among patients with compensated and decompensated cirrhosis in relation to SVR and changes in model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score.

Methods

Consecutive DAA-treated chronic HCV-infected patients with cirrhosis from 4 hepatology clinics were included. The primary endpoint in survival analyses was clinical disease progression, defined as liver failure, hepatocellular carcinoma, liver transplantation or death.

Results

In total, 868 patients were included with a median age of 59 (IQR 54–65) years; 719 (83%) with Child-Pugh A cirrhosis and 149 (17%) with Child-Pugh B/C cirrhosis. SVR was attained by 647 (90%) Child-Pugh A patients and 120 (81%) Child-Pugh B/C patients. During a median follow-up of 28 (IQR 20–36) months, 102 (14%) Child-Pugh A patients and 96 (64%) Child-Pugh B/C patients experienced clinical disease progression. SVR was independently associated with an improved event-free survival in patients with Child-Pugh A cirrhosis (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 0.47; 95% CI 0.27–0.82, p = 0.007), but not in patients with Child-Pugh B/C cirrhosis (adjusted HR 1.23; 95% CI 0.67–2.26; p = 0.51). Twelve weeks post-DAAs, 28 (19%) patients with Child-Pugh B/C cirrhosis had ≥ 2-point MELD decline, but their 2-year event-free survival did not differ from those with a stable MELD (47.9%; 95% CI 28.7–67.1 vs. 48.9%; 95% CI 38.1–59.7, respectively, p = 0.99).

Conclusions

Among patients with chronic HCV infection, DAA-induced SVR was associated with a reduced risk of clinical disease progression in patients with Child-Pugh A cirrhosis but not in patients with Child-Pugh B/C cirrhosis. In Child-Pugh B/C cirrhosis, a ≥ 2-point MELD decline did not translate into improved clinical outcome.

Lay Summary

Chronic HCV infection can be cured with antiviral therapy. In this study, we evaluated the long-term effects of antiviral therapy on liver-related complications in patients with cirrhosis. Our results suggest that patients with compensated cirrhosis who were cured of their HCV infection have a lower rate of complications. In contrast, the rate of complications was not related to virological cure among those with decompensated cirrhosis. While these patients seem to remain in need of liver transplantation, antiviral therapy may lower their priority on the liver transplantation waiting list.

### Organ system failure scoring system can predict hospital mortality in critically ill cirrhotic patients [^116YJ2fU]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2003). Low credibility.

Goals

This study was conducted to assess and compare the accuracy of Child-Pugh classification and organ system failure (OSF) scores, obtained on the first day of ICU admission, in predicting the hospital mortality in critically ill cirrhotic patients.

Background

Cirrhotic patients admitted to the medical intensive care unit (ICU) are associated with high mortality rates. The prognosis of critically ill cirrhotic patients is determined by the extent of hepatic and extrahepatic organ dysfunction.

Study

A total of 111 patients diagnosed with liver cirrhosis were admitted to medical ICU from July 2001 to June 2002. Information considered necessary to compute the Child-Pugh and OSF scores on the first day of ICU admission was prospectively collected.

Results

The overall hospital mortality rate was 64.9%. Liver disease was most commonly attributed to hepatitis B viral infection. The OSF scores demonstrate a good fit using the Hosmer and Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test. Meanwhile, by using the areas under receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve, the OSF scores demonstrated an excellent discriminative power (AUROC 0.901), whereas the performance of Child-Pugh scores is clearly poorer (AUROC 0.748).

Conclusion

This investigation confirms that the prognosis for cirrhotic patients admitted to ICU is grave. The OSF score is a simple, reproducible, and easily applied tool with excellent prognostic abilities that can provide objective information for patients' families and physicians and supplement the clinical judgment of prognosis.

### Hepatocellular carcinoma [^114Jrd3p]. NCCN (2025). High credibility.

Hepatocellular carcinoma — Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) hepatic reserve scoring is outlined: MELD is a numerical scale ranging from 6 (less ill) to 40 (gravely ill) for individuals ≥ 12 years, derived using three laboratory values (serum bilirubin, creatinine, and INR), and has been adopted by the United Network for Organ Sharing to stratify patients on the liver transplantation waiting list according to their risk of death within 3 months. Advantages include incorporation of renal function and an objective laboratory-based system, but clinical assessments of ascites and encephalopathy are not included; it is currently unclear whether MELD is superior to the Child-Pugh (C-P) score as a predictor of survival, and MELD has not been validated as a predictor of survival in patients with cirrhosis who are not on a liver transplantation waiting list. Serum creatinine, an important component of MELD, can be an unreliable marker of renal dysfunction, especially in patients with cirrhosis.

### Association of liver cirrhosis severity with anemia: does it matter? [^1139gd3A]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The etiology of anemia in liver disease is diverse and often multifactorial. Anemia is more severe in advanced stages of liver cirrhosis and can be a predictor of the severity of liver disease.

Methods

In this cross-sectional observational study, we included 181 cirrhotic patients with anemia owing to liver cirrhosis and its complications. The population was divided into 2 groups based on the model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score and the severity of anemia was assessed in the 2 groups. Similarly, hemoglobin levels were assessed in 3 groups based on the Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) classification.

Results

There was a statistically significant correlation between CTP class and hemoglobin (P < 0.001), with the lowest hemoglobin levels in CTP C patients. The correlation coefficient between hemoglobin and MELD score was -0.671 and was statistically significant, establishing that hemoglobin levels decrease with increasing severity of liver cirrhosis. Of 58 patients with macrocytosis, 45 (77.6%) had a MELD score of > 12, whereas only 13 patients (22.4%) had a MELD score of < 12. This difference was statistically significant (P < 0.0001).

Conclusions

This study shows that hemoglobin levels decrease with increasing severity of liver disease; thus, this measure can be used in the initial assessment of patients to give a picture of the severity of the disease. A larger prospective trial is needed to establish the use of hemoglobin levels for assessing severity and predicting mortality in patients with liver cirrhosis.

### Noninvasive assessment of hepatic decompensation [^113e17NY]. Hepatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Prediction of further decompensation and mortality

After the first decompensation, a second decompensating event drastically increases the likelihood of mortality within 5 years. Further decompensations are driven less by fibrosis and more by hyperdynamic circulation, inflammation, immune dysfunction, and intrahepatic vascular resistance. Therefore, NITs of fibrosis are less clinically useful for predicting further decompensation. Instead, algorithms and biomarkers of hepatic function predict the overall risk of further decompensation and short-term mortality, whereas specific biomarkers predict ascites, encephalopathy, and variceal bleeding, as described previously.

The MELD score was developed in 2000 for patients with TIPS, and validated in 2001 for predicting 3-month mortality in ambulatory and hospitalized patients with cirrhosis (C -statistic = 0.87). This work was done to improve organ allocation, which until then was based on the Child-Pugh score and time spent on a waiting list. The MELD score combines creatinine and bilirubin measurements with INR. The score ranges from 6 to ≥ 40, with a MELD score < 10 corresponding to a 1.9% risk of 3-month mortality, increasing to 6% for a MELD score of 10–19, 20% for a MELD score of 20–29, 53% for a MELD score of 30–39, and 71% for a MELD score ≥ 40. Because hyponatremia is a strong predictor of waiting-list mortality, the MELD score was revised to include serum sodium in 2008, and the MELD-Na is now in use for organ allocation in North America. Recently, MELD 3.0 was developed, adding female sex, albumin, and interactions between laboratory parameters to the equation. The latest MELD version improved discrimination for 3-month mortality (C -statistic = 0.87) and could potentially improve access to transplantation for female patients. The ~60-year-old Child-Pugh score has remained unaltered since R.N.H. Pugh and Roger Williams replaced nutritional status with prothrombin time in 1973; the original version was described by George Wantz and Mary Ann Payne in 1961, and by Child and Turcotte in 1964. The score ranges from 5 to 15 and includes bilirubin, albumin, ascites, encephalopathy, and INR. The Child-Pugh score remains a robust algorithm for predicting mortality in patients with cirrhosis, but it has a smaller range than the MELD score, and the ascites and encephalopathy scoring components may be affected by operator variance. Both the MELD and Child-Pugh scores predict mortality more accurately in decompensated than compensated patients. Other scores have been developed for particular populations, including the Albumin-Bilirubin grade for HCC patients with cirrhosisand European Foundation for the Study of Chronic Liver Failure Consortium for hospitalized patients with ACLF.

### Development and validation of insulin-like growth factor-1 score to assess hepatic reserve in hepatocellular carcinoma [^111Kcz2L]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2014). Low credibility.

Functional liver reserve is an important predictor of outcome in hepatic diseases. Therefore, a comprehensive and accurate evaluation of the liver reserve is crucial to predicting patients' survival and treatment outcome. An early attempt to develop a system for evaluating liver reserve was the Child-Turcotte score in 1964, which involved two objective variables (serum bilirubin and albumin) and three subjective variables (severity of ascites, encephalopathy, and nutritional status). In 1973, Child and Pugh modified the score by replacing the most subjective variable (nutritional status) with an objective test (prothrombin time). The resulting Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) score was originally intended as an assessment of life expectancy in the setting of transection of the esophagus for portal hypertensive variceal bleeding in cirrhotic patients. Eventually, however, the CTP score became the standard method for evaluating hepatic reserve and predicting life expectancy in patients with cirrhosis. Because cirrhosis underlies most cases of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and advanced cirrhosis can, in fact, affect patients' survival to a greater degree than the carcinoma itself, the CTP score has become the standard prognostic tool for predicting survival and for assessing hepatic reserve to guide initial or subsequent therapy decisions by predicting risk of liver failure and death after local and systemic therapies and for categorizing patients under HCC staging systems for trial entry.

For prognostication, "MELD score > 21 or Child-Pugh score ≥ 12 are also associated with an ~6-month life expectancy", and "Bereavement services… should be considered as a potential benefit in the decision-making process".

### Non-transplant therapies for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and child-pugh-turcotte class B cirrhosis [^115ctoft]. The Lancet: Oncology (2017). Medium credibility.

Underlying liver cirrhosis is present in most patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, and liver transplantation is the only treatment strategy to cure both diseases. All other hepatocellular carcinoma treatment strategies have to take into account residual liver function that concurs with the patient's prognosis and might limit their feasibility. In patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and Child-Pugh-Turcotte class B (CPT-B), owing to borderline liver function, any intervention might be offset by liver function deterioration. In this setting, the decision for hepatocellular carcinoma treatment requires a comprehensive assessment of liver function, not restricted to the CPT classification, in addition to a careful evaluation of the prognostic effect of hepatocellular carcinoma compared with cirrhosis. In this Review, we provide an overview of the literature regarding the benefits and harms of non-transplant therapies in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and CPT-B cirrhosis.

### Model for end-stage liver disease and child-turcotte-pugh score as predictors of pretransplantation disease severity, posttransplantation outcome, and resource utilization in United network for organ sharing status 2A patients [^116Cu5E3]. Liver Transplantation (2002). Low credibility.

The Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) has been proposed as a replacement for the Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) classification to stratify patients for prioritization for orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). Improved classification of patients with decompensated cirrhosis might allow timely OLT before the development of life-threatening complications, reducing the number of critically ill patients listed as United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) status 2A at the time of OLT. We compared the ability of the MELD and CTP scores to predict pre-OLT disease severity, as well as outcome and resource utilization post-OLT. Data from 42 consecutive UNOS status 2A patients undergoing OLT at a single center were used to calculate MELD and CTP scores at the time of status 2A listing. Multivariate analysis was used to determine the relationship between these scores and pre-OLT disease severity measures, survival post-OLT, and measures of resource use post-OLT. The MELD was superior to CTP score in predicting pre-OLT requirements for mechanical ventilation and dialysis. Neither score correlated with the resource utilization parameters studied. Only two patients died within 3 months post-OLT; neither score was predictive of survival in this cohort. In summary, the MELD is superior to CTP score in estimating pre-OLT disease severity in UNOS status 2A patients and thus may help risk stratify status 2A or decompensated status 2B OLT candidates and optimize the timing of OLT. However, neither score correlated with resource use post-OLT in the strata of critically ill patients.

An analysis of almost 6000 patients from Europe, the United States, Japan, and China showed that ALBI, which stratifies patients into three risk categories, performs as well as the C-P score, and patients scored as C-P grade A were categorized into either ALBI grade 1 or 2.

### ACG clinical guideline: perioperative risk assessment and management in patients with cirrhosis [^11363sjb]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Cholecystectomy in cirrhosis — prevalence, indications, and alternatives are as follows: Cholelithiasis is approximately 2-fold more prevalent in cirrhosis, and patients with asymptomatic cholelithiasis should not be treated. In Child–Turcotte–Pugh (CTP) A and B cirrhosis, indications for elective cholecystectomy are the same as in noncirrhotic patients, and laparoscopic cholecystectomy remains the procedure of choice. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is generally safe in CTP A and B but is associated with significantly higher postoperative complications and mortality in CTP class C. For acute cholecystitis, antibiotics and cholecystostomy are the standard of care. When concern or uncertainty exists, perioperative mortality estimation using the VOCAL-Penn score may help decision-making, and for prohibitive surgical risk, antibiotics with percutaneous cholecystostomy, transpapillary drainage, or endoscopic ultrasound-guided transmural gallbladder drainage are alternatives.

Scoring systems for cirrhosis: Child and MELD systems

The Child-Turcotte classification system was initially proposed in 1964 to predict mortality after portosystemic shunt surgery. It was then modified in 1972 by Pugh et al. when the nutritional status criterion was replaced by prothrombin time (or INR). The Child-Pugh classification relies on three objective laboratory (albumin level, bilirubin level, and prothrombin time) and two subjective clinical (severity of ascites and encephalopathy) criteria to stratify patients into three classes (A, B, or C; with C representing the most advanced cases). It is currently utilized in a variety of surgical and medical scenarios. Predicted mortality varies from 10% for Child-Pugh A, 30% for Child-Pugh B, and up to 80% for Child-Pugh C. Its discriminatory ability, however, is extremely compromised by inter-observer variability of the subjective criteria, and the stratification of a wide range of laboratory values into only three risk groups.

The sentinel publication of the Model of End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) in 2000 introduced a more accurate scoring system to predict mortality after insertion of transjugular intra-hepatic portosystemic shunts (TIPS), based on bilirubin, creatinine, and international normalized ratio (INR) values. In the original publication, a MELD score < 8 was predictive of good post-TIPS survival, whereas a MELD score > 18 translated into significantly greater mortality. Since then, a number of series have validated the MELD system for different operations, with slightly variable reported cutoff values for poor outcomes. In a review of the literature, Hanje and colleagues concluded that elective abdominal surgery could be recommended for MELD scores < 10, but should be strongly discouraged for a MELD scores > 15. The current major utility of the MELD system, however, has been demonstrated in prioritizing patients on liver transplantation waiting lists. Recently, the superiority of a revised MELD system incorporating sodium levels has been suggested, but is awaiting further validation.

In non-transplant patients, MELD risk stratification is also often preferred to Child-Pugh scoring due to its more objective and detailed risk stratification with a continuum of possible scores. Unfortunately, and similar to the limitations associated with the Child-Pugh score, the MELD is not specific to patients with surgical emergencies.

### A systematic review of the performance of the model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) in the setting of liver transplantation [^113TqgT9]. Liver Transplantation (2006). Low credibility.

The Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score is now used for allocation in liver transplantation (LT) waiting lists, replacing the Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) score. However, there is debate as whether it is superior to CTP score to predict mortality in patients with cirrhosis on the LT waiting list and after LT. We reviewed studies comparing the accuracy of MELD vs. CTP score in transplantation settings. We found that in studies of the LT waiting list (12,532 patients with cirrhosis), only 4 of 11 showed MELD to be superior to CTP in predicting short-term (3-month) mortality. In addition, 2 of 3 studies (n = 1,679) evaluating the changes in MELD score (DeltaMELD) showed that DeltaMELD had better prediction for mortality than the baseline MELD score. The impact of MELD on post-LT mortality was assessed in 15 studies (20,456 patients); only 6 (9,522 patients) evaluated the discriminative ability of MELD score using the concordance (c) statistic (the MELD score had always a c-statistic < 0.70). In 11 studies (19,311 patients), high MELD score indicated poor post-LT mortality for cutoff values of 24–40 points. In re-LT patients, 2 of 4 studies evaluated the discriminative ability of MELD score on post-LT mortality. Finally, several studies have shown that the predictive ability of MELD score increases by adding clinical variables (hepatic encephalopathy, ascites) or laboratory (sodium) parameters. On the basis of the current literature, MELD score does not perform better than the CTP score for patients with cirrhosis on the waiting list and cannot predict post-LT mortality.

### Risk of bacterial infection in patients with cirrhosis and acute variceal hemorrhage, based on Child-Pugh class, and effects of Antibiotics [^116dJ4rc]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2015). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Antibiotics frequently are overused and are associated with serious adverse events in patients with cirrhosis. However, these drugs are recommended for all patients presenting with acute variceal hemorrhage (AVH). We investigated whether patients should be stratified for antibiotic prophylaxis based on Child-Pugh scores, to estimate risks of bacterial infection, rebleeding, and mortality, and whether antibiotics have equal effects on patients of all Child-Pugh classes. We performed a sensitivity analysis using model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) scores.

Methods

In a retrospective study, we analyzed data from 381 adult patients with cirrhosis and AVH (70% men; mean age, 56 y), admitted from 2000 through 2009 to 2 tertiary care hospitals in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. We excluded patients with bacterial infection on the day of AVH. The association between antibiotic prophylaxis and outcomes was adjusted by liver disease severity and by a propensity score.

Results

The patients included in the study had mean MELD scores of 16, and 54% received antibiotic prophylaxis. Overall, antibiotic therapy was associated with lower risks of infection (adjusted odds ratio, 0.37; 95% confidence interval, 0.91–0.74) and mortality (adjusted odds ratio, 0.63; 95% confidence interval, 0.31–1.29). Among patients categorized as Child-Pugh class A given antibiotics, only 2% developed infections and the mortality rate was 0.4%. Among patients categorized as Child-Pugh class B given antibiotics, 6% developed infections, compared with 14% of patients who did not receive antibiotics; antibiotics did not affect mortality. Administration of antibiotics to patients categorized as Child-Pugh class C reduced infections and mortality by approximately 50%, compared with patients who did not receive antibiotics. MELD scores were not as useful as Child-Pugh class in identifying patients at risk for infection.

Conclusions

Based on a retrospective analysis of patients with cirrhosis and AVH, those categorized as Child-Pugh class A had lower rates of bacterial infection and lower mortality rates in the absence of antibiotic prophylaxis than patients categorized as classes B or C. The recommendation for routine antibiotic prophylaxis for this subgroup requires further evaluation.

### Six score systems to evaluate candidates with advanced cirrhosis for orthotopic liver transplant: which is the winner? [^113TsiTX]. Liver Transplantation (2010). Low credibility.

Many prognostic systems have been devised to predict the outcome of liver transplantation (LT) candidates. Today, the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) is widely used for organ allocation, but it has shown some limitations. The aim of this study was to investigate the performance of MELD compared to 5 different score models. We evaluated the prognostic ability of MELD, modified Child-Turcotte-Pugh, MELD-sodium, United Kingdom MELD, updated MELD, and integrated MELD in 487 candidates with cirrhosis for LT at the Bologna Transplant Centre, Bologna, Italy, between 2003 and 2008. Calibration analysis by Hosmer-Lemeshow test, calibration curves, and concordance c-statistics (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC]) were calculated at 3, 6, and 12 months. Actual cumulative survival curves, taking into account the event of interest in the presence of competing risk, were obtained using the best cutoffs identified by AUC. For each score, the Hosmer-Lemeshow test revealed a good calibration. Integrated MELD showed calibration curves closer to the line of perfect predicting ability, followed by MELD-sodium at 3 months and modified Child-Turcotte-Pugh at 6 months. MELD-sodium AUCs at 3 and 6 months (0.798 and 0.765, respectively) and integrated MELD AUC at 6 months (0.792) were better than standard MELD (P < 0.05). Actual survival curves showed that these 2 scores were able to identify the patients with the highest drop-out risk. In conclusion, MELD-sodium and integrated MELD were the best prognostic models to predict drop-out rates among patients awaiting LT.

### Transient elastography can stratify patients with child pugh A cirrhosis according to long-term risk of decompensation: a longitudinal cohort study [^113unuAo]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

There are no robust noninvasive tools to predict long-term liver-related events in well-compensated cirrhosis. We assessed the performance of noninvasive fibrosis tools in predicting decompensation, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and liver-related mortality (LRM) within a mixed aetiology Child Pugh A cirrhosis cohort.

Design

Patients were followed in a single centre for 10 years. The primary outcome was decompensation (ascites, encephalopathy, or variceal bleeding). Secondary outcomes were HCC and LRM. All patients received baseline transient elastography for liver stiffness measurement (LSM) and blood tests to calculate Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4).

Results

In 114 patients, 31% decompensated during the follow-up period. 11% developed HCC. Increased LSM is associated with greater decompensation risk (P = 0.007). When controlling for FIB-4 and alcohol consumption, for each 1 kPa increase, the 10-year risk of decompensation increased by 2.2% [P = 0.009, hazard ratio: 1.022, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.01–1.04]. Ten-year risk of decompensation was 20% for LSM < 21 kPa, 32% in the 21–35kPa group, and 47% in the ≥ 35kPa group (P = 0.019). After censoring for HCC, index LSM was associated with risk of death or liver transplant [odds ratio (OR): 1.029 (95% CI: 1–1.06) P = 0.039]. FIB-4 is associated with HCC risk (P = 0.001) with an OR: 1.16 (95% CI: 1.01–1.32).

Conclusion

Ten-year risk of decompensation increased with increasing LSM in mixed aetiology compensated cirrhosis. LSM can be used to risk-stratify real-world patients, in order to reassure those at lowest risk and potentially focus resources on patients with higher scores and greatest decompensation risk.

### Factors associated with renal dysfunction in hepatitis C-related cirrhosis and its correlation with Child-Pugh score [^111TNbda]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2019). High credibility.

Child and Turcotte first gave a scoring system to predict operative risk in patients undergoing portosystemic shunt surgery for variceal bleeding. Initially, it included ascites, hepatic encephalopathy (HE), nutritional status, total bilirubin and albumin but later, it was modified by Pugh et al who added prothrombin time or international normalised ratio and removing nutritional status. Child-Pugh score (CPS) has been useful to find the severity of liver dysfunction in the clinical setting.

The objectives of this study were to determine:

the factors associated with renal dysfunction (RD),
the correlation between the severity of RD and extent of liver damage and
the cut-off value of CPS to predict RD in patients with HCV-induced liver cirrhosis.

### Serum liver fibrosis markers predict hepatic decompensation in compensated cirrhosis [^1166xQwW]. BMC Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Currently available survival scoring systems, such as the Child–Pugh score (CPS) and the model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score, have been widely validated as accurate predictors of short or medium-term survival in patients with liver cirrhosis. However, their accuracy is limited in compensated cirrhosis and non‐cirrhotic liver disease because they depend on variables reflecting pathophysiological changes associated with advanced disease. Early identification of cirrhotic patients at risk for hepatic decompensation remains a major challenge. Thus, we assessed whether the HA, LN, CIV, and PIIINP levels are non-invasive predictors of hepatic decompensation in patients with compensated cirrhosis with varying etiologies.

Regarding classification and risk stratification for variceal hemorrhage, more specifically with respect to risk stratification, ESGE 2022 guidelines recommend to obtain risk stratification in patients with advanced chronic liver disease presenting with suspected acute variceal bleeding according to the Child-Pugh score and MELD score, and by documentation of active/inactive bleeding at the time of upper gastrointestinal endoscopy.

### MELD scoring system is useful for predicting prognosis in patients with liver cirrhosis and is correlated with residual liver function: a European study [^116wBYky]. Gut (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Indices for predicting survival are essential for assessing prognosis and assigning priority for liver transplantation in patients with liver cirrhosis. The model for end stage liver disease (MELD) has been proposed as a tool to predict mortality risk in cirrhotic patients. However, this model has not been validated beyond its original setting.

Aim

To evaluate the short and medium term survival prognosis of a European series of cirrhotic patients by means of MELD compared with the Child-Pugh score. We also assessed correlations between the MELD scoring system and the degree of impairment of liver function, as evaluated by the monoethylglycinexylidide (MEGX) test.

Patients and Methods

We retrospectively evaluated survival of a cohort of 129 cirrhotic patients with a follow up period of at least one year. The Child-Pugh score was calculated and the MELD score was computed according to the original formula for each patient. All patients had undergone a MEGX test. Multivariate analysis was performed on all variables to identify the parameters independently associated with one year and six month survival. MELD values were correlated with both Child-Pugh scores and MEGX test results.

Results

Thirty one patients died within the first year of follow up. Child-Pugh and MELD scores, and MEGX serum levels were significantly different among patients who survived and those who died. Serum creatinine, international normalised ratio, and MEGX(60) were independently associated with six month mortality while the same variables and the presence of ascites were associated with one year mortality. MELD scores showed significant correlations with both MEGX values and Child-Pugh scores.

Conclusions

In a European series of cirrhotic patients the MELD score is an excellent predictor of both short and medium term survival, and performs at least as well as the Child-Pugh score. An increase in MELD score is associated with a decrease in residual liver function.

### Laparoscopic cholecystectomy in cirrhotic patients: the value of MELD score and Child-Pugh classification in predicting outcome [^114J2XGw]. Surgical Endoscopy (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is a challenging procedure in patients with cirrhosis. This study aims to evaluate the safety and outcome of laparoscopic cholecystectomy in patients with cirrhosis and examines the value of model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score and Child-Pugh classification in predicting morbidity.

Materials and Methods

From January 1995 to July 2008, 220 laparoscopic cholecystectomies were performed in cirrhotic, Child-Pugh class A and B patients. Indications included symptomatic gallbladder disease and cholecystitis. MELD score ranged between 8 and 27. Child-Pugh class and MELD score were preoperatively calculated and associated with postoperative results. Data regarding patients and surgical outcome were retrospectively analyzed.

Results

No deaths occurred. Postoperative morbidity occurred in 19% of the patients and included hemorrhage, wound complications, and intra-abdominal collections controlled conservatively. Intraoperative difficulty due to liver bed bleeding was experienced in 19 patients. Conversion to open cholecystectomy was necessary in 12 cases. Median operative time was 95 min. Median hospital stay was 4 days. Patients with preoperative MELD score above 13 showed a tendency for higher complication rate postoperatively. Child-Pugh classification did not seem to predict morbidity effectively.

Conclusion

Laparoscopic cholecystectomy can be performed safely in selected patients with cirrhosis Child-Pugh A and B and symptomatic cholelithiasis with acceptable morbidity. Some of its advantages are shorter operative time and reduced hospital stay. MELD score seems to predict morbidity more accurately than Child-Pugh classification system.

### Epstein-Barr virus infection is associated with a higher Child-Pugh score and may predict poor prognoses for patients with liver cirrhosis [^115Z51MW]. BMC Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Liver function, child-Pugh score, model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score and acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF)

Liver function, including albumin, the albumin-to-globulin ratio (A/G), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), total bilirubin (TB), direct bilirubin (DB), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), and cholinesterase (CHE), was reviewed.

The Child-Pugh score and MELD score are used to accurately assess liver function and prognosis of patients with liver cirrhosis. We calculated the Child-Pugh and MELD scores of the patients according to the collected data.

Diagnostic criteria and grading of ACLF based on the chronic liver failure-sequential organ failure assessment (CLIF-SOFA score). And CLIF-C Score was also assessed.

Risk factors associated with 28-, 90-, and 180-day transplant-free mortalities in patients with EBV-IgG positive liver cirrhosis

In this study, the 28-, 90-, and 180-day mortality rates were determined from the first day of admission to the hospital to 28, 90, and 180 days.

According to previous studies on mortality risk factors for patients with liver cirrhosis, we analyzed the 28-, 90-, and 180-day mortality rates by univariate and multivariate logistic regression, including the Child-Pugh score, MELD score, ACLF, age, ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, gastrointestinal bleeding, hepatocellular carcinoma, hepatorenal syndrome, bacterial infection, hypoalbuminemia, EBV infection, international normalized ratio (INR), and serum creatinine (Scr).

Statistical analysis

Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS software. The results are expressed as the mean ± standard deviation (SD), and percentage. The means for continuous variables were compared using an independent group Student's t-test, for which the data were normally distributed; otherwise, the Mann-Whitney U test was used. Categorical variables were analyzed by the chi-square test or the Fisher's exact test. The risk factors for mortality were analyzed by univariate and multivariate logistic binary regression. All p -values were based on a two-tailed test of significance. Statistical significance was always defined as a p-value < 0.05.

### Significance of theC-caffeine breath test for patients with cirrhosis [^113NrH8n]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Third, we found no correlation between Child-Pugh or MELD score and the CBT values. MELD score is a valid prognostic score for intermediate term mortality in patients with cirrhosis. Child-Pugh score is a simple descriptive marker of the severity of cirrhosis with an almost equivalent to the MELD score prognostic value. Our conclusion is in agreement with the results of Lewis et al who used the salivary caffeine clearance to evaluate the hepatic functional reserve in cirrhosis. The authors concluded that, while caffeine clearance correlated strongly with the Child-Pugh score in outpatients with mild cirrhosis, there was no correlation between the same parameters in hospitalized patients with more severe decompensated liver disease. Although the salivary caffeine clearance is a less reliable assay, the similarity with our results suggests that the hepatic functional compromise and the microsomal P450 1A2 derangement are not reflected by the Child-Pugh and presumably MELD scores. This observation remains to be validated in future larger studies.

Given its simplicity and non-invasive nature, there may be indications that CBT might be useful in clinical practice. One indication for CBT might be the long-term follow up of patients with early-stage cirrhosis, which may progress to a more advanced stage without substantial changes in clinical and/or laboratory findings. The CBT might be also used to improve the predictive value of current clinical scores. Such a combined score might improve the assessment of the severity of cirrhosis.

In conclusion, the present study shows that the CBT can reliably differentiate the patients with cirrhosis. Since CBT can be an easy to use, safe, non-invasive method for the evaluation of liver function impairment, larger prospective studies are required to assess its predictive role in the long-term outcome of patients with cirrhosis.

Summary Box

What is already known:

Reliable and accurate predictors of the severity and prognosis of patients with chronic liver disease are required in daily clinical practice
Several 13C-breath tests have been recently evaluated for the assessment of liver function in a variety of chronic liver diseases
In particular, the 13C-caffeine breath test (CBT) has provided promising results for the evaluation of such patients

What the new findings are:

CBT values were found to reliably differentiate the patients with cirrhosis
CBT values did not differ between non-cirrhotic patients with chronic liver disease and healthy controls
In patients with decompensated cirrhosis, CBT results did not seem to be affected by the smoking habits or to be associated with the Child-Pugh or Meld score

### Improvement of prognostic power of the Child-Pugh classification of liver cirrhosis by hyaluronan [^111mMcaA]. Journal of Hepatology (2003). Low credibility.

Background/Aims

Modifications of the Child-Pugh classification of liver cirrhosis by incorporation of hyaluronan were tested to improve the prognostic power for long term evaluation of liver cirrhosis in 126 patients observed over a period of 10 years.

Methods

Serum concentrations of HA were determined at study entry. Statistical analysis included Kaplan-Meier life tables and stepwise multivariant Cox-regression analysis for each parameter of Child-Pugh classification and hyaluronan. Prognostic models were developed by exchanging prothrombin time, albumin and encephalopathy by HA in different combinations.

Results

Based on a good single correlation between hyaluronan (0.62) and clinical course (P < 0.01) we conclude that models with hyaluronan instead of albumin or encephalopathy and with or without shifted threshold values of bilirubin and albumin are superior for the prediction of the long term prognosis. In Cox-regression analysis, apart from hyaluronan and bilirubin, no other parameters contributed to an improvement.

Conclusions

We conclude that a modification of the Child-Pugh classification of liver cirrhosis by inclusion of HA significantly improves the predictive power of CP, especially in alcoholic etiology. A prospective validation of the newly defined scores needs to be done in the future.

### MELD score is better than Child-Pugh score in predicting 3-month survival of patients undergoing transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt [^116KXk4j]. Journal of Hepatology (2002). Low credibility.

Background/Aims

Patients undergoing transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) are at risk of early death due to end-stage liver failure. The aim of this study was to compare model of end-stage liver disease (MELD) and Child-Pugh scores as predictors of survival after TIPS.

Methods

We studied 140 cirrhotic patients treated with elective TIPS. Concordance (c)-statistic was used to assess the ability of MELD or Child-Pugh scores to predict 3-month survival. The prediction of overall survivals was estimated by comparing actuarial curves of subgroups of patients stratified according to either Child-Pugh scores or MELD risk scores.

Results

During a median follow-up of 23.7 months, 55 patients died, 14 underwent liver transplantation and seven were lost to follow-up. For 3-month survival, the discrimination power of MELD score was superior to Child-Pugh score (0.84 vs. 0.70, z = 2.07; P = 0.038). Unlike Pugh score, MELD score identified two subgroups of Child C patients with different overall survivals (P = 0.027). The comparison between observed and predicted survivals showed that MELD score overrates death risk.

Conclusions

MELD score is superior to Child-Pugh score as predictor of short-term outcome after TIPS. Its accuracy, however, decreases for long-term predictions.

### Mortality risk prediction in liver transplant candidates: a prognostic model using key clinical variables [^116dUG6a]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

In our study, the Child–Pugh score was statistically significant in logistic regression and demonstrated a strong ability to predict mortality among liver transplant candidates on the waiting list, with an AUC of approximately 0.77. Despite its moderate discrimination, its sensitivity and PPV were limited, reflecting the challenges of prediction in rare-event settings. This finding highlights the continued clinical relevance of the Child–Pugh classification, which has been widely used to evaluate liver function and estimate surgical risk. Previous research, including studies by Hoteit and Gilroy et al. has shown that mortality risk varies across Child–Pugh classes. Patients in Class A tend to have relatively low post-surgical mortality, whereas those in Class C face significantly higher risks. However, the Child–Pugh score includes subjective components such as the assessment of ascites and hepatic encephalopathy. These elements may lead to variability between observers and limit the score's precision in predicting outcomes, as noted by Mai et al. To address these limitations, more objective scoring systems have been developed. The MELD score, for example, was specifically designed to estimate short-term mortality in patients with decompensated liver disease and has become the standard for transplant allocation, as highlighted by Lai et al. Despite the widespread adoption of MELD, the Child–Pugh score continues to provide valuable prognostic information in certain contexts. Botta et al. found that in European cohorts, the Child–Pugh classification remained a reliable predictor of both short- and medium-term survival and performed comparably to MELD in some clinical scenarios. Our findings support the continued use of the Child–Pugh score as a simple and informative tool in pre-transplant risk assessment, especially when applied alongside more objective models to enhance decision-making.

### Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) clinical practice guideline on immunotherapy for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma [^112DADbk]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2021). High credibility.

Child-Pugh classification and albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) grade — liver function assessment and prognosis in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are described with explicit thresholds: Child-Pugh uses "a final score ranging from 5 to 15" and is "classified into one of three classes: A (5–6), B (7–9), and C (10–15)". Prognosis differs by class, with "median survival of untreated HCC… approximately 2.5 times lower in patients with Child-Pugh B… compared with… Child-Pugh A". ALBI defines three grades by score cutoffs — "ALBI score ≤ −2.60 (ALBI grade 1), ALBI score > −2.60 to ≤ −1.39 (ALBI grade 2), and ALBI score > −1.39 (ALBI grade 3)" — and "demonstrated superior prognostic value to the Child-Pugh score… particularly within patients with Child-Pugh A", also predicting outcomes after "surgical resection (p < 0.001), transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) (p < 0.001) and sorafenib treatment (p < 0.001)".

Regarding classification and risk stratification for acute-on-chronic liver failure, more specifically with respect to severity assessment, EASL 2023 guidelines recommend to prefer the CLIF-C ACLF score over the MELD score, MELD-Na score, and Child-Pugh score for predicting the risk of 28-day and 90-day mortality in patients with ACLF.

### AGA clinical practice update on surgical risk assessment and perioperative management in cirrhosis: expert review [^115MmGuP]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2019). High credibility.

Cholecystectomy in cirrhosis — elective cholecystectomy should be delayed in patients with cirrhosis who are candidates for a liver transplantation, and if urgent surgery must be carried out and the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis is certain, patients should be referred urgently to a center with experience in carrying out cholecystectomy in patients with cirrhosis; we do not recommend cholecystectomy in patients with Child-Pugh class C cirrhosis or refractory ascites. Such patients are also generally not candidates for percutaneous cholecystostomy, unless they are critically ill, and in noncirrhotic patients with acute calculous cholecystitis, percutaneous drainage may be carried out if technically feasible to relieve symptoms. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy has been associated with a higher mortality rate in patients with cirrhosis compared with noncirrhotic patients, with an increased requirement for conversion to open cholecystectomy; in this setting, the MELD score correlates well with mortality risk but not with risk of complications, and although there is no prospective comparison with open cholecystectomy, in a single retrospective study using historical controls the laparoscopic approach appeared to be preferable when technically feasible.

### Predictive scoring systems for in-hospital mortality due to acutely decompensated liver cirrhosis in Indonesia [^112yTC1U]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

There are several limitations to our study. This study was a single-centre, retrospective cohort study and is therefore susceptible to information bias. In daily clinical practice, using our scoring systems at the time of hospital admission could help clinicians with an early screening of high-risk patients. However, further studies are needed to see whether a serial assessment of the scoring systems throughout hospitalization also correlate with mortality outcome. Previous studies showed that in high-risk patients with variceal bleeding (HVPG ≥ 20 mmHg, Child–Pugh B with active bleeding or Child–Pugh C ≤ 13), pre-emptive TIPSS improved the long-term mortality rate. Pre-emptive TIPSS was also associated with decreased in-hospital mortality. Due to resources limitation at our institution, none of our patients were treated with TIPSS. Further studies are needed to confirm whether our scoring systems could also select those high-risk patients who are candidates for pre-emptive TIPSS. Further validation of our proposed predictive scoring systems in different populations is needed to confirm our findings.

### Diagnosis and treatment of alcohol-associated liver diseases: 2019 practice guidance from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^116HFgJs]. Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

Alcohol-associated cirrhosis (AC) — diagnosis and prognosis — may be identified at decompensation or during evaluation of abnormal findings; abdominal imaging may reveal hepatic nodularity or signs of portal hypertension, and transient elastography may provide evidence of increased liver stiffness. AC cannot be differentiated from other causes of cirrhosis except through careful evaluation of drinking history and exclusion of other causes of liver disease. Prognosis is assessed using the Child-Pugh-Turcotte (CPT) and the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD or MELD-Na) score, and outcomes are crucially influenced by the patient's ability to abstain, both to slow the progression of fibrosis and its consequences, and in anticipation of evaluation for LT. Decompensation of a patient with cirrhosis may reflect the onset of AH, as most patients with AH have already developed AC; thus, an opportunity for treatment may be lost.

### Multicenter external validation of risk stratification criteria for patients with variceal bleeding [^111SNCCa]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2018). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Early placement of a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts (TIPS) is considered the treatment of choice for patients with acute variceal bleeding (AVB) and cirrhosis who have a high risk of death (Child-Pugh class B with active bleeding at endoscopy or Child-Pugh class C). It has been proposed that patients of Child-Pugh class B, even with active bleeding, should not be considered high risk. Alternative criteria have been proposed for identification of high-risk patients, such as Child-Pugh class C with plasma level of creatinine of 1 mg/dL or more (ChildC-C1) and a model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score of 19 or more. We analyzed outcomes of a large cohort of patients with AVB who received the standard of care at different centers to validate these systems of risk stratification.

Methods

We performed an observational study of 915 patients with liver cirrhosis and AVB who received standard treatment (drugs, antibiotics, and endoscopic ligation, with TIPS as the rescue treatment), over different time periods between 2006 and 2014 in Canada and Europe. All patients were followed until day 42 (week 6) after index AVB or death. Child-Pugh and MELD scores were calculated at time of hospital admission. The primary outcome was mortality 6 weeks after index AVB among patients who met the early TIPS criteria (Child-Pugh class B with active bleeding at endoscopy or Child-Pugh class C), MELD19 criteria (patients with MELD scores of 19 or more), and ChildC-C1 criteria.

Results

Among 915 patients with AVB, 18% died within 6 weeks. Among the 523 patients who met the early TIPS criteria, 17% died within 6 weeks. All 3 rules discriminated patients at high risk of death from those with low risk: 28.3% of the patients classified as high risk by the early TIPS criteria died whereas only 7.0% of patients classified as low risk died; 46.0% of patients classified as high risk by the MELD19 criteria died vs 8.1% of patients classified as low risk; 51.9% of patients classified as high risk by the ChildC-C1 criteria died compared with 10.9% of patients classified as low risk. Mortality was significantly lower among patients with Child-Pugh class B (11.7%) than with Child-Pugh class C (35.6%) (P ≤ .001). Mortality was similar between patients with Child-Pugh class B cirrhosis with or without active bleeding (11.7%). Patients with Child-Pugh class A cirrhosis or MELD scores of 11 or less had low mortality (2%-4%), patients with Child-Pugh class B cirrhosis or MELD scores of 12 to 18 had intermediate mortality (10%-12%), and patients with Child-Pugh class C cirrhosis or MELD scores of 19 or more had high mortality (22%-46%).

Conclusions

Patients with Child-Pugh class B cirrhosis and AVB who receive standard therapy, regardless of the presence of active bleeding, have 3-fold lower mortality than patients with Child-Pugh C cirrhosis and might not need TIPS. Patients with Child-Pugh class C and/or MELD scores of 19 or more should be considered at high risk of death. These findings might help refine criteria for early TIPS.

### Sorafenib for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and Child-Pugh B liver cirrhosis: lessons learned from a terminated study [^116iwZ4A]. The Oncologist (2020). Medium credibility.

Unfortunately, this incomplete study is limited in drawing definitive conclusions on impact of Child‐Pugh B liver function on sorafenib PK, efficacy, and safety. This is the second study in patients with Child‐Pugh B patients treated with sorafenib that had to be terminated prematurely due to slow enrollment [23]. This reflects the difficulty in recruiting and treating these patients, mainly due to the higher risk of cirrhosis‐related adverse events. In a prior study, we extensively discussed this topic and pled for adherence to the current guidelines and restriction of sorafenib to patients with Child‐Pugh A liver function [9]. Interestingly, one patient with a partial response to sorafenib had an OS of 26 months, showing that longer survival is possible in patients with Child‐Pugh B and underscoring limitations of Child‐Pugh as a prognostic tool when considering sorafenib. Novel algorithms, such as the recently proposed "Prediction of Survival in Advanced Sorafenib‐treated HCC" (PROSASH) score have refined survival prediction based on prognostic and predictive clinical features [27, 28]. This approach offers an individualized survival prediction with a higher accuracy than the Child‐Pugh score and BCLC‐algorithm 29. These algorithms may improve clinical decision making and optimize the prognostic stratification of future clinical studies in which sorafenib is the control arm. Further studies in the mechanisms leading to the onset of sorafenib toxicity and treatment effect are needed to find additional biomarkers that may aid in improved survival prediction and patient‐tailored treatment.

In conclusion, patients with Child‐Pugh B liver function are unlikely to benefit from sorafenib treatment due to a higher risk of cirrhosis‐related adverse events. Further studies in the mechanisms leading to the onset of sorafenib toxicity and treatment effect are needed to find additional biomarkers that may aid in improved survival prediction and patient‐tailored treatment.

### Efficacy and safety of cabozantinib for patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma based on albumin-bilirubin grade [^111FjbkP]. British Journal of Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) frequently present with underlying cirrhosis, the severity of which is generally assessed by the Child-Pugh grade. Most clinical trials of systemic therapies in HCC are limited to patients with Child-Pugh grade A liver cirrhosis, including the phase 3 CELESTIAL trial of cabozantinib in HCC. However, heterogeneity exists among Child-Pugh grade A patients, attributed in part to the requirement for clinical assessments of ascites and encephalopathy, which introduces subjectivity. To provide a more objective measure of liver function, a scoring system based on serum albumin and bilirubin (ALBI) was developed based on laboratory data from a large international cohort of patients. Within the Child-Pugh A category, patients can be furthered categorised by ALBI score, most often corresponding to ALBI grade 1 or ALBI grade 2; with higher ALBI grades associated with worse liver dysfunction and overall poor prognosis.

In the phase 3 CELESTIAL trial, cabozantinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, which inhibits MET, VEGFR and AXL, significantly improved overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) versus placebo in patients with previously treated advanced HCC. For the overall CELESTIAL population, median OS was 10.2 months with cabozantinib versus 8.0 months with placebo (hazard ratio [HR] 0.76; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.63–0.92; p = 0.005), and median PFS was 5.2 months with cabozantinib versus 1.9 months with placebo (HR 0.44; 95% CI 0.36–0.52; p < 0.001). Considering the limitations of Child-Pugh scoring, and to better delineate the potential impact of liver function on treatment outcomes in CELESTIAL, we assessed key outcomes based on ALBI grade at study baseline.

DC is associated with a significant physical and psychosocial symptom burden which is most pronounced in the final year of life. Determining an accurate prognosis in patients with liver disease is challenging, due to the uncertain trajectory of the illness characterised by decompensations of disease and subsequent (partial) recovery. It is important to make patients aware of this uncertainty. It is now well recognised that there is a place for PC earlier in the patients' disease course. Parallel planning is important in the management of patients with other organ failures — 'hoping for the best but planning for the worst'. This is a useful phrase to use with patients when introducing the concept of PC.

Who and when to refer to PC?

Clinicians are often unsure as to when referral to PC services is appropriate. There are several tools available to identify patients with decompensated liver disease, who may benefit from referral to PC. Broadly speaking, they include:

Patients with Child Pugh C cirrhosis.
Patients with decompensated ARLD and ongoing alcohol use.
Patients with irreversible decompensated disease not deemed to be candidates for LT.
Patients undergoing assessment for LT or who are on the liver transplant waiting list.
Patients with two unplanned liver-related admissions within the past 6 months.
Patients with hepatocellular carcinoma for best supportive care.

### Prognostic role of mean platelet volume in patients with cirrhosis [^116pzEQW]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Studies carried out in patients with chronic hepatitis have shown that mean platelet volume (MPV) is associated with worse disease stage, although the role of MPV in patients with cirrhosis is less clear.

Aim

To evaluate the association between MPV values and clinical characteristics and stage of cirrhosis, and to assess its prognostic role.

Methods

We studied 75 patients with cirrhosis and assessed the association between MPV values and cirrhosis characteristics, prognostic scores, and survival. The prognostic role of longitudinal variations of MPV was also assessed in 50 patients who had at least 12 months follow-up and who had MPV determination at 3-monhtly intervals.

Results

Median MPV values were not statistically different according to aetiology of liver disease (P = 0.485) and disease severity both taking into consideration the Child-Pugh classification (P = 0.438) and the Model for End-stage Liver Disease score (P = 0.978). Median MPV values were not significantly different in 23 Child-Pugh class C patients who died or survived (9.15fL versus 9.10fL, P = 0.794) during a 12-month follow-up. Lastly, there was no significant modification of MPV over time at the various study time-points (3-month, 6-month, 9-month, 12-month) between patients who died and those who survived.

Conclusions

In patients with cirrhosis, MPV has no association with severity of disease and prognosis.

Liver function assessment is a critical component of HCC treatment that is required for every patient. Some of the staging systems embed within them the Child-Pugh classification, recognizing the need for assessing the extent of liver functionality as part of the staging of the disease. The Child-Pugh score evolved over time from the original system built in 1973 to help assess for survival of patients with bleeding esophageal varices. Of note, in the original Pugh effort, none of the patients had HCC. The system evolved into a five-parameter staging system which consists of three laboratory values (serum albumin, bilirubin, and prothrombin levels) and two clinically assessed variables (presence and degree of ascites and hepatic encephalopathy). A final score ranging from 5 to 15 is calculated based on the range of laboratory values and severity of clinical symptoms, and then classified into one of three classes: A (5–6), B (7–9), and C (10–15). Median survival of untreated HCC has been shown to be approximately 2.5 times lower in patients with Child-Pugh B disease compared with those with Child‐Pugh A. Recently, however, the limitations and subjectivity involved in the grading of clinical variables have called into question Child-Pugh scores in assessing liver function in HCC.

The albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) grade, a simpler model to assess liver function based only on serum albumin and bilirubin, has been validated in study cohorts from multiple geographic regions and multiple clinical scenarios, including patients undergoing resection and sorafenib treatment. The score is calculated as (log₁₀ bilirubin [µmol/L]×0.66) + (albumin [g/L] × −0.0852), leading to three possible grades: ALBI Score ≤ −2.60 (ALBI grade 1), ALBI Score > −2.60 to ≤ −1.39 (ALBI grade 2), and ALBI Score > −1.39 (ALBI grade 3). The ALBI grade demonstrated superior prognostic value to the Child-Pugh score in a study of patients with HCC treated with radioembolization, particularly within patients with Child-Pugh A disease. ALBI grade also predicts OS after surgical resection (p < 0.001), transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) (p < 0.001) and sorafenib treatment (p < 0.001), with independent prognostic value across BCLC stages, geographic regions (p < 0.001), and for cancers being treated with immunotherapy.

Lastly, the focus of this trial on patients with Child‐Pugh B7‐8 exposed the limitations of the Child‐Pugh score as a tool for patient selection. Prior studies have reported up to 12.1% discrepancies in Child‐Pugh score, caused by interobserver variation of subjective parameters (severity of ascites, encephalopathy) or incorrect categorization of continuous parameters (albumin, bilirubin, prothrombin‐time) [6]. Small fluctuations in serum test can also lead to migration of patients across Child‐Pugh classes.

In total, 5 male patients were enrolled with a median age of 69 years (range 63–79 years). Patients were treated for a median of 13 weeks (range, 5 days to 46 weeks) with a median tolerated daily dose of 400 mg (range 200–600 mg). All patients died, with a median PFS of 3.8 months (range 1.7–10.8 months) and OS of 7.4 months (range 1.7–25.8 months). Three patients experienced severe adverse events, including one patient admitted with a variceal bleeding and refractory ascites, 1 patient with grade 3 hyperbilirubinemia and refractory ascites, and 1 patient with grade 3–4 hand‐foot syndrome complicated by a sepsis with grade 3 hypoalbuminemia and grade 3 hyponatremia.

### Significance of theC-caffeine breath test for patients with cirrhosis [^116RU9fK]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Any chronic liver disease can lead to cirrhosis, characterized histologically by extensive fibrosis and the conversion of normal liver architecture into structurally abnormal nodules. The severity of cirrhosis may range from a completely asymptomatic compensated phase to symptomatic decompensated liver disease presenting with ascites, variceal bleeding, hepatic encephalopathy and/or non-obstructive jaundice. Since cirrhosis represents the end-stage of any chronic liver disease, it has been mandatory to elaborate reliable and accurate predictors of its severity and prognosis. To date, two widely accepted prognostic scores are mainly used in clinical practice worldwide: the Child and the subsequently modified Child-Pugh score, and the more recently developed MELD (model for end-stage liver disease) score, which has replaced the Child-Pugh score in prioritizing patients on the waiting list for liver transplantation.

Several 13 C-breath tests have been recently evaluated for the assessment of liver function in a variety of chronic liver diseases. Among them, the caffeine breath test (CBT) appears to be promising, since caffeine has high oral bioavailability, almost exclusive hepatic metabolism principally via demethylation by cytochrome P450 1A2 to CO₂, low extraction ratio, low plasma binding capacity and may be considered innocuous when used at test doses. Thus, CBT values can reflect the functional hepatic reserve and represent a good marker of the severity of liver function impairment.

Park et al found that CBT values correlate inversely and reproducibly with the degree of hepatic dysfunction, as estimated by Child-Pugh score. CBT values were lower in subjects with cirrhosis of varying etiology than in non-cirrhotic patients with chronic hepatitis B or C. They also showed that the 13 C-CBT results can assess the severity of fibrosis in chronic hepatitis B patients and may show improvement in liver function in response to long-term lamivudine therapy. In two further studies, it was shown that the CBT results can reliably predict severe hepatic fibrosis in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. It should be emphasized that the existing studies assessing the performance of CBT have included only patients with chronic liver disease and well-compensated cirrhosis, but not cases with decompensated cirrhosis. The aim of the current study was to determine the utility of the CBT in assessing cirrhosis and examine its relationship with MELD score.

### Evaluation of the increase in model for end-stage liver disease (deltaMELD) score over time as a prognostic predictor in patients with advanced cirrhosis: risk factor analysis and comparison with initial MELD and child-turcotte-pugh score [^114XQ9Tn]. Journal of Hepatology (2005). Low credibility.

Background/Aims

The model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) has been used to prioritize cirrhotic patients awaiting liver transplantation. The change in MELD score over time (DeltaMELD) may have additional prognostic value. We investigated the ability of DeltaMELD to predict the outcome of advanced cirrhosis and prospectively assessed the factors associated with increasing DeltaMELD.

Methods

Risk factors were determined in 58 prospectively followed-up patients. The predictive power of DeltaMELD, initial MELD and Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) score was compared by using c-statistic in 351 patients.

Results

Ascites (P = 0.020) and hepatic encephalopathy (P = 0.023) were significantly associated with increasing MELD score at 3 months. The area under receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for DeltaMELD/month was 0.779 compared with 0.718 for MELD (P = 0.130) and 0.528 for CTP score (P < 0.001) at 6 months; the area was 0.822, 0.744 and 0.528, respectively (P = 0.018 and < 0.001, respectively) at 12 months. DeltaMELD/month > 2.5 was the only significant prognostic predictor at 6 (odds ratio: 9.8, P < 0.001) and 12 months (odds ratio: 16.3, P < 0.001) in multivariate logistic analysis.

Conclusions

Increasing MELD score is associated with the onset of ascites and encephalopathy. DeltaMELD is superior to initial MELD and CTP scores to predict intermediate term outcome in patients with advanced cirrhosis.

### Scoring system for predicting 90-day mortality of in-hospital liver cirrhosis patients at cipto mangunkusumo hospital [^113rRe6R]. BMC Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The mortality rate of patients with liver cirrhosis has significantly increased in recent years, including in Indonesia. Based on research conducted by Mokdad et al. in 1980–2010, Indonesia ranked fourth in the world for the highest mortality rate of cirrhotic patients compared to 186 other countries. According to the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), during the period of 2007–2017, liver cirrhosis increased by 5.6% as the most common cause of mortality in Indonesia. In 2016, a study by Gani et al. at our hospital showed that the mortality rate of patients with liver cirrhosis in the first 2 years was 75.3%, with the highest mortality occurring in the first 3 months after hospital admission. A retrospective cohort study by Gani et al. using medical record data of hospitalized patients in 2017 found that the 90-day mortality rate in hospitalized patients was 54.8%, where the contributing factors included age, leukocytes, and Child-Pugh.

Multiple factors, including intrahepatic and extrahepatic factors, can cause death in liver cirrhosis patients A previous study conducted at our hospital showed that infection was the most common cause of death in these patients. The high mortality rate in patients with liver cirrhosis has raised particular concerns for clinicians to develop a method to accurately identify patients at high-risk so that treatments can be modified to reduce the risk of death.

The most widely used predictors of mortality in patients with liver cirrhosis (LC) worldwide are the Child-Pugh Score (CP) and the Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD). In the United States, a study conducted by Kartoun et al. introduced MELD-Plus (an improvement of MELD and MELD-Na scores) to predict the mortality rate of patients with liver cirrhosis in the first 90-day after hospital admission. In Indonesia, Gani et al. assessed the prognosis predictor of mortality in LC patients using Child-Pugh and MELD scoring system. The results showed that CP scores > 7 and MELD > 9 could be good predictors with sensitivity and specificity up to 70%. However, no studies in Indonesia specifically discuss the scoring system to assess 90-day mortality after hospital admission in liver cirrhosis patients. Thus, the aim of this study is to develop a scoring system to predict the mortality rate of patients with liver cirrhosis in the first three months after hospital admission at Cipto Mangunkusumo General Hospital, Jakarta.

### Upper digestive bleeding in cirrhosis. post-therapeutic outcome and prognostic indicators [^112hkxGZ]. Hepatology (2003). Low credibility.

Several treatments have been proven to be effective for variceal bleeding in patients with cirrhosis. The aim of this multicenter, prospective, cohort study was to assess how these treatments are used in clinical practice and what are the posttherapeutic prognosis and prognostic indicators of upper digestive bleeding in patients with cirrhosis. A training set of 291 and a test set of 174 bleeding cirrhotic patients were included. Treatment was according to the preferences of each center and the follow-up period was 6 weeks. Predictive rules for 5-day failure (uncontrolled bleeding, rebleeding, or death) and 6-week mortality were developed by the logistic model in the training set and validated in the test set. Initial treatment controlled bleeding in 90% of patients, including vasoactive drugs in 27%, endoscopic therapy in 10%, combined (endoscopic and vasoactive) in 45%, balloon tamponade alone in 1%, and none in 17%. The 5-day failure rate was 13%, 6-week rebleeding was 17%, and mortality was 20%. Corresponding findings for variceal versus nonvariceal bleeding were 15% versus 7% (P = 0.034), 19% versus 10% (P = 0.019), and 20% versus 15% (P = 0.22). Active bleeding on endoscopy, hematocrit levels, aminotransferase levels, Child-Pugh class, and portal vein thrombosis were significant predictors of 5-day failure; alcohol-induced etiology, bilirubin, albumin, encephalopathy, and hepatocarcinoma were predictors of 6-week mortality. Prognostic reassessment including blood transfusions improved the predictive accuracy. All the developed prognostic models were superior to the Child-Pugh score. In conclusion, prognosis of digestive bleeding in cirrhosis has much improved over the past 2 decades. Initial treatment stops bleeding in 90% of patients. Accurate predictive rules are provided for early recognition of high-risk patients.

### AASLD practice guidance: palliative care and symptom-based management in decompensated cirrhosis [^113HqrHd]. Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

AASLD practice guidance — hospice and end-of-life care in cirrhosis emphasizes addressing palliative needs by eliciting end-of-life treatment preferences, creating care plans, and educating about possible scenarios, including infection, bleeding, and hepatic encephalopathy (HE). Hospice is described as a patient- and caregiver-centered option for end-of-life care (EoLC) that is underused by patients dying with cirrhosis. For hospice prognostic eligibility considerations, hepatology teams may consider using MELD > 21 and Child-Pugh > 12 to identify patients with estimated survival of ≤ 6 months. Providing caregivers with information about imminent death may help support decisions aligned with the patient's prognosis, such as providing pain medications despite past substance use disorder at the end of life.

Populations listed as insufficient risk and in need of risk stratification models/biomarkers include Hepatitis C and stage 3 fibrosis with incidence < 0.2% per year and Noncirrhotic NAFLD. For hepatitis B risk groups, surveillance can be initiated as early as third decade of life given median age 46 years at HCC diagnosis.

### Update in the treatment of the complications of cirrhosis [^1124ptga]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Cirrhosis consists of 2 main stages: compensated and decompensated, the latter defined by the development/presence of ascites, variceal hemorrhage, and hepatic encephalopathy. The survival rate is entirely different, depending on the stage. Treatment with nonselective β-blockers prevents decompensation in patients with clinically significant portal hypertension, changing the previous paradigm based on the presence of varices. In patients with acute variceal hemorrhage at high risk of failure with standard treatment (defined as those with a Child-Pugh score of 10–13 or those with a Child-Pugh score of 8–9 with active bleeding at endoscopy), a pre-emptive transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) improves the mortality rate and has become the standard of care in many centers. In patients with bleeding from gastrofundal varices, retrograde transvenous obliteration (in those with a gastrorenal shunt) and/or variceal cyanoacrylate injection have emerged as alternatives to TIPS. In patients with ascites, emerging evidence suggests that TIPS might be used earlier, before strict criteria for refractory ascites are met. Long-term albumin use is under assessment for improving the prognosis of patients with uncomplicated ascites and confirmatory studies are ongoing. Hepatorenal syndrome is the least common cause of acute kidney injury in cirrhosis, and first-line treatment is the combination of terlipressin and albumin. Hepatic encephalopathy has a profound impact on the quality of life of patients with cirrhosis. Lactulose and rifaximin are first- and second-line treatments for hepatic encephalopathy, respectively. Newer therapies such as L-ornithine L-aspartate and albumin require further assessment.

### Construction and validation of a survival prognostic model for stage III hepatocellular carcinoma: a real-world, multicenter clinical study [^112H3D58]. BMC Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Another important factor affecting the prognosis of patients with primary hepatocellular carcinoma is liver function reserve. A large number of studies have shown that liver function is an important reference for the selection of treatment options. With the emergence of Child–Pugh classification and Meld scoring system, the evaluation system of liver function has been gradually improved, providing an important basis for clinicians to assess the liver function reserve of patients and the development of treatment options.

This study includes the index of liver fibrosis degree, which can to some extent reflect liver function. However, relying solely on this data is not ideal. Regrettably, as there were discrepancies in the instruments and scoring systems used across centers, no pertinent indicators for liver function assessment were incorporated in this research. To address this issue, we intend to optimize and supplement the model using data from our own center.

### Analysis of factors related to recanalization of portal vein thrombosis in liver cirrhosis: a retrospective cohort study [^115rbVCy]. BMC Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Although most previous research agreed that anticoagulation contributes to thrombus regression and PVT recanalization, however, there is limited evidence on the long-term prognosis after anticoagulation, and whether anticoagulation improves hepatic function and survival in patients with PVT remains controversial. The MELD score is a scoring system used to assess the severity of the condition of patients with end-stage liver disease, the higher the MELD score, the more severe the condition of the patient and the worse the prognosis; the Child-Pugh classification is another method of assessing liver function and prognosis of patients with cirrhosis, the lower the Child-Pugh classification, the better the liver function of the patient, and the higher the quality of life of the patient. Albumin is an important protein synthesized by the liver, which plays a key role in maintaining plasma colloid osmotic pressure, transporting nutrients, and participating in detoxification. In the case of cirrhosis, the liver's synthetic function is impaired, leading to a decrease in albumin synthesis, which may result in hypoproteinemia. This further may lead to the development of symptoms such as ascites, pleural fluid, and lower extremity edema. Elevated albumin levels in patients with liver cirrhosis may indicate that the patient's liver synthetic function has improved. Therefore, improvement in MELD score and Child-Pugh classification and increase in albumin level in liver cirrhosis patients after anticoagulation therapy are important indicators for assessing the effectiveness of treatment. In our study, the difference in baseline Child-Pugh classification of liver function between the anticoagulation and non-anticoagulation groups at the beginning of follow-up was not statistically significant, but at the end of follow-up, there was a statistically significant increase in Child-Pugh class C patients and a decrease in class A patients in the non-anticoagulation group. Similarly, there was no statistically significant difference in albumin levels between the anticoagulation and non-anticoagulation groups at the beginning of the follow-up, whereas albumin levels were higher in the anticoagulation group than in the non-anticoagulation group at the end of the follow-up, and the difference was statistically significant. A randomized controlled trial showed Child-Pugh scores improved after anticoagulation compared to before anticoagulation (7 vs. 6, p = 0.007) and the albumin level increased after anticoagulation(36.06 6 5.13 vs. 38.64 6 3.75, p = 0.004). Previous studies have also mentioned that anticoagulation may improve liver function, which is supported further by our study. A multicenter, long-term follow-up study of PVT in cirrhosis showed no statistically significant difference in Kaplan-Meier overall survival curves between the anticoagulation and non-anticoagulation groups after 5 years of follow-up (83% vs. 70%, log-rank P = 0.1362). A meta-analysis showed no statistically significant difference in 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates between the anticoagulation and non-anticoagulation groups. The difference in 2-year survival between the two groups was not statistically significant (log-rank, P = 0.840)in our study. A recent meta-analysis showed that anticoagulation reduced all-cause mortality in patients with cirrhosis combined with PVT, with a hazard ratio of 0.59 (95% CI 0.49–0.70). The survival benefit of anticoagulation is independent of recanalization and may be the result of reduced macrovascular and microvascular thrombosis, the latter of which is caused by endothelial dysfunction in cirrhotic hepatic sinusoids and is associated with hepatic stellate cell activation and fibrosis progression.

### Fibrosing cholestatic hepatitis C in post-transplant adult recipients of liver transplantation [^114wFQwB]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Effects of immunosuppressants on recurrent hepatitis C in LT recipients

The use of tacrolimus after LT is associated with significantly reduced rates of death, graft loss, acute rejection, and steroid-resistant rejection. Immunosuppression has been associated with increased disease severity in recurrent hepatitis C cases. The use of stronger immunosuppression was linked to worse outcomes in recurrent hepatitis C cases. No correlation between the type of calcineurin inhibitors (cyclosporine and tacrolimus) and the risk of recurrent hepatitis C was reported. Corticosteroid usage also has an important role in recurrent hepatitis C. Treatment of both acute cellular rejection with multiple boluses of corticosteroids and rapid tapering of steroids have been linked to recurrent disease. The reduced progression of recurrent hepatitis C and better patient outcomes were demonstrated following the use of slow tapering steroid regimens.

Is an assessment of Child-Pugh score for DAA induction necessary for allograft dysfunction after LT?

Child-Pugh score is used to predict the outcome of surgery in cirrhotic patients in general, and more recently, to stratify patients on the waiting list for LT. Then, a simple question arises. Even if serum levels of alanine aminotransferase and the METAVIR system for histologic findings in chronic hepatitis C can be used in transplanted allografts, is an assessment of the Child-Pugh score necessary even in allograft dysfunction after LT?

Initially, cirrhosis with a Child-Pugh score of B or C contraindicates these drugs because of side effects. When there is a decision against using FCH, allograft dysfunction is severe if based on the Child-Pugh score. Even though the Child-Pugh scoring system is useful for assessing liver cirrhosis, it is not suitable for allograft dysfunction after LT. Currently, new DAAs are safe and effective with few side effects, even in a majority of Child's B and C class, when properly selected. The issues here are the reduced efficacy in advanced cirrhosis and in severe renal impairment. The DAAs should be aggressively introduced for FCH C in LT recipients, and that they might improve the clinical course of patients.

### AGA clinical practice update on surgical risk assessment and perioperative management in cirrhosis: expert review [^111661kW]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2019). High credibility.

Primary hepatic resection for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) — Hepatic resection is typically considered only in Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage 0 (early) HCC, defined as a tumor < 2 cm in diameter with normal liver function (Child-Pugh class A) without portal hypertension. Surrogate or direct indicators of the absence of portal hypertension include a peripheral platelet count > 100,000/μL and an hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) < 10 mm Hg. Liver stiffness measurement has been suggested to guide selection but optimal cutoff values have not been validated; in one series, a liver stiffness measurement below 22 kPa was established as the optimal cutoff level for selecting patients for surgery, whereas a measurement of ≥ 22 kPa had greater sensitivity and higher negative as well as positive predictive value in predicting postoperative hepatic decompensation compared with an HVPG > 10 mm Hg, and much lower cutoff values, ranging from 12 to 15 kPa, have also been proposed.

### Establishment of MELD-lactate clearance scoring system in predicting death risk of critically ill cirrhotic patients [^113tLSjg]. BMC Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Liver cirrhosis is a major health problem, causing high mortality and economic burden worldwide. A large proportion of liver cirrhosis patients are prone to acute decompensation with organ failure, which need to be admitted to intensive care unit (ICU). Though liver cirrhosis patients have improved outcomes in ICU over the past decade, the prognosis for these patients still remains poor, with in-hospital mortality rates ranging from 39 to 83%. Therefore, it is essential to carefully evaluate the prognosis of critically ill cirrhotic patients in clinical application, thereby reducing the risk of mortality.

Scoring systems in patients with liver cirrhosis have been widely used in assessing the prognosis of critically ill cirrhotic patients and making clinical decision, such as Child–Pugh score, sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score, chronic liver failure-sequential organ failure assessment (CLIF-SOFA) score, the model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score, chronic liver failure consortium acute-on-chronic liver failure (CLIF-C ACLF) score, chronic liver failure consortium-acute decompensation (CLIF-C AD) score and MELD-Na score. At present, MELD was considered as an objective and effective system to evaluate the severity of patients than other scores, and was also a common method to quantify the mortality risk of ICU patients with cirrhosis. But some studies also purposed that only creatinine, bilirubin, and international normalized ratio (INR) were contained in the MELD scores, which might affect the assessment of the degree of cirrhosis.

Lactate (LA) level is considered as a marker of metabolic changes caused by tissue hypoxia or stress response caused by adrenaline release. A number of clinical studies have concluded that LA level has a good performance in predicting the prognosis of critically cirrhotic patients, suggesting the combination of LA level in the scoring system may improve the predicting performance of death in patients with liver cirrhosis. One study also confirmed that Child–Pugh-LA score, MELD-LA score, CLIF-SOFA-LA score could increase the predicting accuracy for mortality in acute chronic liver failure patients. Recently, the measurements of LA dynamic changes in ICU have been found that significantly superior to static LA measurements in predicting mortality. A decrease in lactate clearance (ΔLA) has been reported to be closely associated with mortality in critically ill patients. ΔLA seems to be more suitable for predicting death in patients with liver cirrhosis.

### Prognostic value of C-reactive protein levels in patients with cirrhosis [^115JziAh]. Liver Transplantation (2015). Low credibility.

I dentifying cirrhosis with a poor short-term prognosis remains crucial for improving the allocation of liver grafts. The purpose of this study was to assess the prognostic value of a model combining the variation of C-reactive protein (CRP) levels within 15 days, the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score, and the presence of comorbidities in patients with decompensated cirrhosis with a Child-Pugh score > B7 and to test the relevance of this model in patients with compensated cirrhosis. We collected data for cirrhotic patients without hepatocellular carcinoma, extrahepatic malignancy, human immunodeficiency virus infection, organ transplantation, seen between January 2010 and December 2011. Multivariate analyses of predictors of 3-month mortality used Cox models adjusted with the age-adjusted Charlson comorbidity index. The prognostic performance [area under receiver operating characteristic curves (AUROCs)] of the 3-variable model was compared to that of the MELD score. The 241 patients who met the inclusion criteria included 109 patients with a Child-Pugh score > B7 who were hospitalized for decompensation. In these patients with severe cases, the 3-month mortality was independently predicted by the MELD score [hazard ratio (HR), 1.10; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.05–1.14; P < 0.001] and a CRP level > 32 mg/L at the baseline and on day 15 (HR, 2.21; 95% CI, 1.03–4.76; P = 0.042). This model was better than MELD alone (AUROC, 0.789 versus 0.734; P = 0.043). In the whole population with cirrhosis, the 3-month mortality was also predicted by high MELD scores (HR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.07–1.16; P < 0.001) and a CRP level > 10 mg/L at the baseline and on day 15 (HR, 2.89; 95% CI, 1.29–6.48; P < 0.001), but the AUROCs of the 3-variable model and the MELD score alone were no longer significantly different (0.89 versus 0.88, not significant). In conclusion, prognostic models incorporating variations in CRP predict 3-month mortality in patients with cirrhosis. Such models are particularly relevant for patients with decompensated cirrhosis but provide a limited increase in prediction in comparison with the MELD score in the whole population with cirrhosis.

### Effects of early placement of transjugular portosystemic shunts in patients with high-risk acute variceal bleeding: a meta-analysis of individual patient data [^116hMVhB]. Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background & Aims

Compared with drugs plus endoscopy, placement of transjugular portosystemic shunt within 72 hours of admission to the hospital (early or preventive transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt [TIPS], also called preemptive TIPS) increases the proportion of high-risk patients with cirrhosis and acute variceal bleeding who survive for 1 year. However, the benefit of preemptive TIPS is less clear for patients with a Child-Pugh score of B and active bleeding (CP-B+AB). We performed an individual data meta-analysis to assess the efficacy of preemptive TIPS in these patients and identify factors associated with reduced survival of patients receiving preemptive TIPS.

Methods

We searched publication databases for randomized controlled trials and observational studies comparing the effects of preemptive TIPS versus endoscopy plus nonselective beta-blockers in the specific population of high-risk patients with cirrhosis and acute variceal bleeding (CP-B+AB or Child-Pugh C, below 14 points), through December 31, 2019. We performed a meta-analysis of data from 7 studies (3 randomized controlled trials and 4 observational studies), comprising 1327 patients (310 received preemptive TIPS and 1017 received drugs plus endoscopy). We built adjusted models to evaluate risk using propensity score for baseline covariates. Multivariate Cox regression models were used to assess the factors associated with survival time. The primary endpoint was effects of preemptive TIPS versus drugs plus endoscopy on 1-year survival in the overall population as well as CP-B+AB and Child-Pugh C patients.

Results

Overall, preemptive TIPS significantly increased the proportion of high-risk patients with cirrhosis and acute variceal bleeding who survived for 1 year, compared with drugs plus endoscopy (hazard ratio [HR] 0.443; 95% CI 0.323–0.607; P < .001). This effect was observed in CP-B+AB patients (HR 0.524; 95% CI 0.307–0.896; p = 0.018) and in patients with Child-Pugh C scores below 14 points (HR 0.374; 95% CI 0.253–0.553; P < .001). Preemptive TIPS significantly improved control of bleeding and ascites without increasing risk of hepatic encephalopathy in Child-Pugh C and CP-B+AB patients, compared with drugs plus endoscopy. Cox analysis of patients who received preemptive TIPS showed that patients could be classified into 3 categories for risk of death, based on age, serum level of creatinine, and Child-Pugh score. In each of these risk categories, preemptive TIPS increased the proportion of patients who survived for 1 year, compared with drugs plus endoscopy.

Conclusions

In a meta-analysis of data from 1327 patients with cirrhosis, acute variceal bleeding, and Child-Pugh score between 10 and 13 points or CP-B+AB, preemptive TIPS increased the proportion who survived for 1 year, in both subgroups separately, compared with drugs plus endoscopy.

### Breaking the Child-Pugh dogma in hepatocellular carcinoma… [^111cxBSK]. ASCO (2022). Medium credibility.

The Child or Child-Turcotte score was proposed to assess prognosis in patients with cirrhosis and portal hypertension as a predictor of postoperative mortality. 2This modification has, henceforth, been referred to as the Child-Pugh score and has subsequently been applied as a prognostic tool for patients with chronic liver disease in other circumstances, including patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. The components of the C-P score were identified empirically as the principal factors perceived to reflect the severity and hence prognosis of cirrhosis. Each of the components was scored individually on the basis of empirically assigned cutoff ranges and descriptive terms, contributing to a total score from 5 to 15 points. The total scores were then divided into three grades of increasing severity and poorer prognosis.

9, 10A review of the literature (This statement is based on a search for Child-Pugh score on the online Google search engine, Google Scholar, and PubMed. Values relating to the various C-P scoring systems were collated focusing on the application of these systems to prognosis of liver cirrhosis in general, rather than cirrhosis that is attributable to specific disease etiologies. 16and is a continuous score that readily lends itself for assessment of changes in liver reserve over time. By comparison, the C-P score, strictly speaking, should only be applied to patients with cirrhosis. It is well-recognized that the clinical diagnosis of cirrhosis is open to substantial interobserver and intraobserver variations, especially for cirrhosis at an early stage, and where, as is the case in most primary care situations, objective measurements such as the liver stiffness measurement are not readily accessible.

The fact that the original C-P score that was based on a total of 38 patients, unrelated to HCC, with no statistical analysis, has held the stage for nearly 50 years is surely a testament to clinical acumen. Although the C-P score will undoubtedly continue to guide treatment decisions in patients with cirrhosis, clinical care of patients with HCC, now counting on a number of local and systemic treatment options, demands solid and evidence-based instruments to deliver the promise of individualized patient management.

### Use of Child-Pugh score to assess perioperative outcome in epithelial ovarian cancer patients… [^113fPDYW]. ASCO (2009). Low credibility.

Abstract 5571 Background: The Child-Pugh score was designed to predict surgical outcome for patients with liver cirrhosis. This score is comprised of five variables that were thought to determine prognosis. Epithelial ovarian cancer and cirrhosis share manifestations of increased abdominal girth, ascites, malnutrition and abnormal laboratory findings. In this study, we evaluate the application of the Child-Pugh score to assess EOC outcome. Methods: A review of EOC patients undergoing primary cytoreductive surgery at our institution from 2003 to 2008 was performed. Pts without preoperative serum bilirubin, albumin, prothrombin time or documentation of ascitic volume were excluded. Women were divided into either Child class A or Child class B/C. Results: A total of 105 patients were evaluated, 29 with early stage and 76 with late stage disease.

Estimated blood loss was not significantly different between Child class A vs B/C groups. Optimal cytoreduction was achieved in 92. 3% vs
65. 8%, respectively. Post-operative ICU admission and minor complication rates were also significantly lower in the Child A vs B/C group. Of note there were 4 peri-operative deaths, all in the B/C group. Length of hospital stay between the two groups were 4 vs 8. 4 days, respectively. Women in Child class B/C had a hazard ratio of 12. 4 for death as compared to those in Child class A. Conclusions: Application of the Child classification to women with ovarian cancer revealed increased rates of suboptimal cytoreduction and peri-operative complications including ICU admission, infection, transfusion and death.

EOC patients with higher Child score prior to surgery may consider neoadjuvant chemotherapy to decrease morbidity of surgery. No significant financial relationships to disclose.

### Systemic therapies for hepatocellular carcinoma and Child-Pugh B cirrhosis: how we treat… [^115E4QPk]. ASCO Daily News (2025). Medium credibility.

Of these patients, the incidence of grade ≥ 3 TRAEs was higher among those with Child-Pugh B disease, and more patients with Child-Pugh B disease discontinued therapy because of TRAEs. 4 More data are needed regarding the suitability of lenvatinib for patients with Child-Pugh B disease. 5 Notably, grade ≥ 3 bevacizumab-related AEs occurred among 15% and 16% of patients with Child-Pugh B and A disease, respectively. Although more patients with Child-Pugh B disease experienced grade ≥ 3 bleeding events and atezolizumab-related AEs compared with the Child-Pugh A group, grade ≥ 3 atezolizumab-related hepatitis only occurred in patients with Child-Pugh A disease. 6 Nivolumab demonstrated a comparable safety profile for patients with Child-Pugh A and B disease, with identical rates of TRAE discontinuation.

In addition to immunotherapy, cabozantinib, an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor, had a manageable safety profile for patients who progressed to Child-Pugh B by week 8 of treatment in the CELESTIAL trial, with similar rates of TRAE discontinuation between patients with Child-Pugh B disease and the overall cohort. 4 A retrospective study of atezolizumab plus bevacizumab treatment reported shorter PFS and lower ORR for patients with Child-Pugh B versus A disease; however, the disease control rate was similar for both groups. 5 Additional studies are needed to further investigate the efficacy of these first-line treatments for this population. As a result, patients with B9 scores are often unlikely to benefit from cancer-directed treatment; best supportive care should be considered if the Child-Pugh score does not improve despite optimal medical treatment with hepatology.

In patients with B8 scores, identifying the source of liver dysfunction is critical to determining who may benefit from treatment; these patients require detailed risk–benefit discussions. In addition to the Child-Pugh score, other metrics should be considered when determining whether patients should receive treatment. The Child-Pugh score comprises 5 criteria: albumin, bilirubin, international normalized ratio/prothrombin time, ascites, and hepatic encephalopathy.
