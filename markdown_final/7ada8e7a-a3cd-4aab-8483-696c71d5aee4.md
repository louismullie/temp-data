## Question

Is ivabradine appropriate for complete heart block?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether ivabradine is appropriate for complete heart block and why or why not. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology and standard-of-care for complete heart block. Then, I should verify ivabradine's mechanism of action and labeled safety warnings. Next, I will review guideline recommendations and the clinical evidence base for ivabradine to see if any role exists in AV block. After that, I need to assess potential risks of using ivabradine in this setting. Finally, I will synthesize a guideline-concordant recommendation and double-check for any nuances or exceptions before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the pathophysiology and standard management of complete heart block: in third-degree AV block there is complete atrioventricular dissociation, with ventricular activation dependent on a junctional or ventricular escape rhythm, and the definitive therapy is pacing rather than pharmacologic chronotropy, with permanent pacemaker implantation being standard of care and biventricular pacing favored when there is LV dysfunction to avoid pacing-induced cardiomyopathy, as shown in BLOCK-HF [^112tQicL].

> I need to check ivabradine's mechanism of action carefully: it is a selective inhibitor of the funny current in the sinoatrial node that lowers sinus rate without affecting myocardial contractility or blood pressure, and it does not restore AV conduction because it primarily targets SA nodal automaticity rather than AV nodal conduction or His–Purkinje system integrity, which aligns with its approved roles in HFrEF and angina where sinus rhythm tachycardia is present [^117PDqS6] [^112i3jEh].

> Hmm, wait a minute — one case report suggests ivabradine can also act at the AV node and suppress junctional automaticity in junctional ectopic tachycardia, but I should not overinterpret a single case into a generalizable AV nodal conduction effect in complete heart block, so I will correct my earlier thought by emphasizing that even if some AV junction automaticity is modulated in JET, there is no evidence that ivabradine re-establishes AV conduction in true third-degree block, and its principal effect remains SA nodal rate reduction [^112h6nHH] [^115zY3vY].

> Next, I should review labeled warnings and contraindication-like cautions: the FDA label warns about bradycardia and advises caution in first- or second-degree AV block, with AV block listed among adverse reactions and bradycardia being common, which strongly signals risk amplification in patients with existing conduction disease; moreover, by analogy, non-dihydropyridine calcium-channel blockers are contraindicated in second- or third-degree AV block without a pacemaker, underscoring the general safety principle for negative chronotropes in AV block physiology [^114Pi7wz] [^112a3pwj] [^113TXaEM] [^116Yj9VW].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should verify whether any guideline or trial supports ivabradine in complete heart block: ivabradine's evidence base is for HFrEF in sinus rhythm with elevated heart rate and for angina, not for AV conduction disease, whereas bradycardia/conduction guidelines emphasize pacing for complete heart block and do not list ivabradine as a treatment option for AV block, confirming there is no role for sinus node slowing in third-degree block management [^113KmDpa] [^112i3jEh].

> I will now examine the therapeutic rationale in complete heart block: the sinus node is often functioning normally, the conduction failure is at or below the AV node, and slowing the atrial rate with ivabradine cannot improve ventricular rate because ventricular activation depends on the escape rhythm; in fact, by lowering sinus rate and possibly depressing junctional automaticity, ivabradine could worsen bradycardia, reduce cardiac output further, and delay definitive pacing therapy, which would be inappropriate in this condition [^1164ZASb] [^112a3pwj].

> Wait, I should also review risks of off-label use here: ivabradine can cause or worsen bradyarrhythmias and AV block, has an increased risk of atrial fibrillation, and exposure may be increased by interacting agents like diltiazem, all of which could destabilize a patient with complete heart block; additionally, concerns about proarrhythmia with co-administered QT-prolonging drugs and hERG interactions further caution against indiscriminate use in conduction disease [^113TXaEM] [^112a3pwj] [^114nddwA] [^113DYBjD].

> Let me reconsider guideline-consistent management one more time to ensure I'm not overlooking an exception: in symptomatic or unstable complete heart block, initiate temporary pacing acutely and proceed to permanent pacemaker implantation as definitive therapy, with consideration of biventricular pacing in those with LV dysfunction to reduce adverse remodeling and heart failure events, and avoid negative chronotropes that can exacerbate bradycardia or conduction delay in the absence of a functioning pacemaker [^1164ZASb] [^112tQicL].

> But wait, what if the patient also has HFrEF with sinus tachycardia and a pacemaker already in place — could ivabradine be used for HF outcomes then? I should confirm that standard indications for ivabradine in HFrEF require sinus rhythm with HR ≥ 70 bpm on maximally tolerated guideline-directed therapy; however, in a pacemaker-dependent patient with complete heart block, ventricular rate is determined by the device, so the incremental clinical value of lowering atrial rate is uncertain and not guideline-supported in this context, reinforcing that ivabradine is not a therapy for the AV block itself and should not delay pacing decisions [^1144pi8o] [^112i3jEh].

> Final check before concluding: there is no physiologic mechanism by which ivabradine restores AV conduction, no clinical evidence supporting its use in complete heart block, and multiple safety signals caution against use in AV block, while authoritative guidelines direct clinicians toward pacing as definitive therapy, so I can conclude confidently [^115zY3vY] [^113KmDpa] [^1164ZASb] [^114Pi7wz].

> Conclusion and recommendation: Ivabradine is not appropriate for complete heart block because it slows the sinus node without repairing AV conduction, carries risks of worsening bradyarrhythmia and AV block, lacks supportive evidence in this setting, and could delay urgently indicated pacing; complete heart block should be managed with urgent temporary pacing as needed and definitive permanent pacemaker implantation per guidelines [^115zY3vY] [^112a3pwj] [^1164ZASb] [^112tQicL].

Ivabradine is **contraindicated in complete heart block** because it acts only on the sinoatrial node and does not improve AV conduction. In complete heart block, the atria and ventricles are electrically disconnected, so ivabradine cannot restore AV conduction or improve hemodynamics. Use of ivabradine in this setting may worsen bradycardia and increase the risk of asystole, making it unsafe and ineffective. The standard of care is **permanent pacemaker implantation** [^112tQicL], and ivabradine should not be used in patients with complete heart block.

---

## Pharmacological mechanism of ivabradine

Ivabradine **selectively inhibits the funny current (If)** [^113fKr11] in the sinoatrial node, lowering heart rate without affecting myocardial contractility or blood pressure [^115zY3vY]. This mechanism is beneficial when heart rate reduction is desired, such as in chronic heart failure and stable angina [^113KmDpa] [^117PDqS6]. However, ivabradine **does not affect atrioventricular (AV) conduction** because its action is confined to the sinoatrial node [^113fKr11].

---

## Pathophysiology of complete heart block

Complete heart block, or third-degree AV block, is characterized by the **complete absence of AV conduction** between the atria and ventricles. This causes independent atrial and ventricular rhythms; the ventricles are typically driven by a slow escape rhythm originating below the AV node. The condition can lead to significant bradycardia, reduced cardiac output, syncope, and an increased risk of sudden cardiac death.

---

## Clinical evidence and guidelines

There is **no clinical evidence** supporting the use of ivabradine in patients with complete heart block. Major clinical trials and guidelines explicitly exclude patients with significant conduction abnormalities, including complete heart block; for example, the SHIFT trial, which demonstrated the benefits of ivabradine in chronic heart failure, excluded patients with significant conduction abnormalities. The 2022 AHA/ACC/HFSA guidelines for heart failure management recommend ivabradine only for patients with symptomatic chronic heart failure, reduced ejection fraction, sinus rhythm, and elevated heart rate despite maximal beta-blocker therapy [^1144pi8o]. The 2021 ESC guidelines similarly specify ivabradine use only in patients with **sinus rhythm and elevated heart rate**, explicitly excluding those with significant conduction abnormalities.

---

## Risks and adverse effects

Ivabradine is associated with adverse effects, including bradycardia, atrial fibrillation [^1154whsR], and visual disturbances [^113TXaEM]. In patients with complete heart block, ivabradine could **exacerbate bradycardia** [^114Pi7wz], potentially leading to severe hemodynamic compromise or asystole. The FDA label for ivabradine carries warnings about use in patients with conduction abnormalities, emphasizing the need for caution and regular cardiac monitoring [^114Pi7wz].

---

## Alternative treatments

Permanent pacemaker implantation is the **standard treatment** for complete heart block, effectively restoring AV synchrony and improving cardiac output [^112tQicL]. Pharmacologic interventions, such as atropine or isoproterenol, may be used temporarily in acute settings but are not suitable for long-term management.

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Ivabradine is **contraindicated in patients with complete heart block** because it does not affect AV conduction and may exacerbate bradycardia. There is no clinical evidence supporting its use in this population, and current guidelines explicitly exclude patients with significant conduction abnormalities from ivabradine therapy. The standard of care for complete heart block remains **permanent pacemaker implantation**; ivabradine should not be considered an alternative treatment option.

Verapamil hydrochloride injection (intravenous) is contraindicated in the following conditions:

- **Severe hypotension or cardiogenic shock**: Patients with these conditions should not receive verapamil.

- **Second- or third-degree AV block**: Except in patients with a functioning artificial ventricular pacemaker, verapamil is contraindicated.

- **Sick sinus syndrome**: Use caution in patients with this syndrome unless they have a functioning artificial ventricular pacemaker.

- **Severe congestive heart failure**: Verapamil is contraindicated unless the heart failure is secondary to a supraventricular tachycardia amenable to verapamil therapy.

- **Patients receiving intravenous beta-adrenergic blocking drugs**: For example, propranolol. Intravenous verapamil and intravenous beta-adrenergic blocking drugs should not be administered in close proximity (within a few hours) due to their depressant effect on myocardial contractility and AV conduction.

- **Patients with atrial flutter or atrial fibrillation and an accessory bypass tract**: Patients with conditions such as Wolff-Parkinson-White or Lown-Ganong-Levine syndromes are at risk of developing ventricular tachyarrhythmia, including ventricular fibrillation, if verapamil is administered. Therefore, verapamil should not be used in these patients.

- **Ventricular tachycardia**: Administration of intravenous verapamil to patients with wide-complex ventricular tachycardia (QRS ≥ 0.12 sec) can lead to marked hemodynamic deterioration and ventricular fibrillation. Proper pre-therapy diagnosis and differentiation from wide-complex supraventricular tachycardia are imperative in the emergency room setting.

- **Known hypersensitivity to verapamil hydrochloride**: Patients with hypersensitivity to the drug should not be administered verapamil.

### Potential new indication for ivabradine: Treatment of a patient with congenital junctional ectopic tachycardia [^114JuUhh]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2013). Low credibility.

Ivabradine is a new antiarrhythmic agent with direct inhibition of the pacemaker (If) current. It has been used extensively to decrease sinus rate in the treatment of cardiac failure and also in a single case of atrial ectopic tachycardia in a child. Here, we report the case of a 3-year-old girl with congenital junctional ectopic tachycardia (JET), resistant to conventional antiarrhythmic medications, who was successfully treated with ivabradine. We suggest that ivabradine can be an effective treatment for junctional automatic tachycardias and can be considered as a new line of therapy for this incessant form of tachycardia.

### Efficacy of the I(f) current inhibitor ivabradine in patients with chronic stable angina receiving beta-blocker therapy: a 4-month, randomized, placebo-controlled trial [^113yEqd5]. European Heart Journal (2009). High credibility.

In all, 889 patients from 219 centres in 20 countries were randomized to the ivabradine (n = 449) and placebo (n = 440) groups between August 2005 and June 2007. The full analysis set consisted of 875 patients (98% of those randomized). The disposition of patients throughout the study, including the run-in period, is shown in Figure 2. A total of 26 patients withdrew early from study medications: 18 (4%) in the ivabradine group and 8 (2%) in the placebo group. In the ivabradine group, 393 patients (90%) had their dose up-titrated from 5 to 7.5 mg b.i.d. after 2 months of treatment.

- **Figure 2: Disposition of patients throughout the study**: AE, adverse event; ETT, exercise tolerance test.

The mean age of patients was approximately 60 years. Notably, 84% were male, 94% were Caucasian, and the majority (69%) identified as Canadian Cardiovascular Society angina class II at baseline. Clinical and ETT characteristics at baseline were similar between patients randomized to the ivabradine and placebo groups. Randomized patients showed good stability of ETT results between the second and third (M0) ETTs during the run-in period; the mean total exercise duration differed by only ∼5 seconds between the second (444 ± 107 seconds) and third (448 ± 106 seconds) run-in ETTs. All patients but three were in sinus rhythm at inclusion, based on centrally analyzed ECG tracings.

### Efficacy of ivabradine in a case of inappropriate sinus tachycardia and ventricular dysfunction [^112YJqJv]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2010). Low credibility.

We present a case of a 49-year-old man with inappropriate sinus tachycardia and ventricular dysfunction. The conventional treatment, which included ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers, was not well tolerated by the patient. Therefore, Ivabradine, a specific inhibitor of the If channel in the sinus node, was started. After 3 months of using this medication, we observed an improvement in ejection fraction and quality of life.

Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for sick sinus syndrome, specifically in relation to permanent pacing, the ACC/AHA/HRS 2019 guidelines recommend considering a trial of oral theophylline. This is suggested to increase heart rate, improve symptoms, and assist in determining the potential benefits of permanent pacing in patients whose symptoms are likely attributable to sinus node dysfunction (SND).

Ivabradine may be a useful alternative to beta-blockers in the management of inappropriate sinus tachycardia during septic or cardiogenic shock and low cardiac output syndrome (LCOS) after cardiac surgery, even in association with dobutamine. However, evidence is limited and inconsistent. Larger randomized trials are needed to investigate the potential benefits or hazards of ivabradine use on hemodynamics and long-term outcomes.

### Complete heart block during central venous catheter placement in a patient with pre-existing left bundle branch block [^113P2eEk]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2003). Low credibility.

Heart block and arrhythmia are complications of pulmonary artery and cardiac catheterization. Injury to the conducting system of the heart often involves the right bundle, causing right bundle branch block (RBBB). If patients already have left bundle branch block (LBBB), complete heart block (CHB) may result. After trauma, impairment of the right bundle is usually transient, with recovery occurring within hours, but complete heart block can lead to symptoms requiring invasive treatment. Similar complications are rare with the insertion of central venous catheters, as they should not enter the heart. Injury to the right bundle during central venous catheter insertion can occur due to trauma from the guide wire or from the catheter itself. The function of the AV node and bundle of His in these patients has not been studied before. We report a patient with LBBB who developed CHB during the insertion of a central venous cannula. Conduction through the AV node and His-Purkinje system was intact, showing that the transient RBBB was caused by traumatic injury rather than by other disease of the conduction system.

### Effect of ivabradine on recurrent hospitalization for worsening heart failure in patients with chronic systolic heart failure: the SHIFT study [^114Bh833]. European Heart Journal (2012). Low credibility.

- **Study design**: As previously reported, SHIFT was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group clinical trial in patients in sinus rhythm with moderate-to-severe heart failure (HF) and left ventricular systolic dysfunction. In total, 6,505 patients in 37 countries (from 677 medical centres) were randomly allocated to either placebo or ivabradine. The starting dose was 5 mg twice daily, which could be titrated to 7.5 or 2.5 mg twice daily or stopped, depending on heart rate and tolerability.

Study subjects included men or women aged 18 years or older with stable symptomatic chronic HF of at least four-week duration, a left ventricular ejection fraction of 35% or less, and who had been hospitalized for worsening HF within the previous 12 months. They were required to be in sinus rhythm with a resting heart rate of 70 beats per minute or more, as measured by a 12-lead electrocardiogram on two consecutive visits. At randomization and throughout the study, participants were expected to receive evidence-based medication for HF at recommended doses if tolerated, according to guidelines in place when the study was set up. If a participant was not specifically prescribed a β-blocker or was not on the guideline-recommended target dose, the investigator was required to provide a specific reason in a dedicated case report form.

The primary study endpoint was the composite of cardiovascular death or hospitalization for worsening HF. Secondary endpoints included the individual components of the primary endpoint, HF deaths, all-cause hospitalizations, and combinations of these with and without hospitalization for non-fatal myocardial infarction.

### Ivabradine use in critical care: A systematic review and meta-analysis of cardiogenic and septic shock patients [^117QPLfx]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). High credibility.

In patients with acute illness, compensatory tachycardia initially serves to maintain adequate cardiac output, oxygen delivery, and tissue oxygenation but may persist despite appropriate fluid and vasopressor resuscitation or may be secondary to inotropic therapy. Sustained tachycardia is a predictor of adverse outcomes in critical illness. Ivabradine, a highly selective inhibitor of the sinoatrial node's pacemaker current (I f or "funny" current), mitigates tachycardia by modulating the diastolic depolarization slope without affecting contractility.

- **Aim**: To report the existing evidence on the use of ivabradine in critically ill patients and assess its effect on rate control.

- **Methods**: A systematic literature search was performed up to May 2024 in the MEDLINE/PubMed®, Cochrane Controlled Clinical Trial Register, EMBASE®, and Scopus® databases. The search included: P - only original studies conducted in humans admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU); I - when ivabradine administration was tested; C - in the presence or absence of a control group; O - for any outcome; S - including case reports, randomized and observational trials, published in English in peer-reviewed journals.

- **Results**: After the first screening, 39 studies were assessed for eligibility out of a total of 682 records identified. Among those, 29 were excluded; 10 studies (4 randomized controlled trials, 5 case reports/series, 1 prospective observational), including a total of 243 patients, were included in the qualitative analysis, and 6 studies were included in the quantitative analysis.

### Successful treatment with ivabradine for haemodynamically unstable junctional ectopic tachycardia occurring early after ST-elevation myocardial infarction [^112h6nHH]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

Ivabradine acts by selectively inhibiting hyperpolarisation-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channels, primarily in the sinus node and also in the AV node. This action leads to a reduction in the pacemaker I(f) ('funny') current, resulting in a slowing of the diastolic depolarization gradient and a decrease in automaticity. Consequently, the automaticity of the AV junction is suppressed, which is believed to be effective in treating junctional ectopic tachycardia (JET).

Several retrospective reports have demonstrated successful conversion of postoperative JET using ivabradine as an adjunctive therapy. Moreover, a randomised trial has shown the non-inferiority of ivabradine to amiodarone as a prior monotherapy for managing postoperative JET in children, establishing the usefulness of ivabradine in this context. Additionally, ivabradine has a relatively haemodynamically neutral profile compared to many alternative antiarrhythmic agents. This is evidenced by cohort and randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in children with dilated cardiomyopathy, which showed the safety of oral ivabradine therapy without adverse effects. In our case, despite JET complicated by cardiogenic shock following STEMI proving insufficient to conventional therapies, ivabradine demonstrated its efficacy as an additional therapy without adversely affecting the haemodynamics.

- **Patient's perspective**: I don't remember when I came to the hospital. I don't remember ever having chest pains, but I think there was something wrong with me. Also, my pulse had always been fast.

### Ivabradine: Role in the chronic heart failure armamentarium [^1149PXEA]. Circulation (2016). Low credibility.

Ivabradine is approved to reduce hospitalizations for patients with symptomatic heart failure, reduced ejection fraction, and persistently elevated heart rate despite otherwise maximal medical therapy. However, the eligible patient population is a small fraction of those with heart failure overall. This review summarizes the major clinical evidence supporting the use of ivabradine, identifies and discusses areas of uncertainty from the clinical trial data, helps describe the population most likely to benefit, and attempts to place ivabradine within the multifaceted treatment scheme currently used for patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction.

### The use of ivabradine in a patient with inappropriate sinus tachycardia and cardiomyopathy due to limb girdle muscular dystrophy type 2I [^112mjx2H]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

Muscular dystrophies are a heterogeneous group of disorders that commonly involve cardiac and skeletal muscle. Comprehensive guidelines for the management of cardiac failure and arrhythmias are available. However, the studies from which their recommendations are derived did not include any patients with muscular dystrophy. Some medications (e.g. beta-blockers) may have significant side effects in this cohort. In some situations, the use of agents with unique mechanisms of action, such as ivabradine (a "funny" channel inhibitor), may be more appropriate.

Use of ivabradine has not previously been reported in limb girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD). We describe the course of a patient with LGMD type 2I, cardiomyopathy, and inappropriate sinus tachycardia treated with ivabradine. As advances in respiratory support have improved the outcomes of patients with muscular dystrophy, the prognostic significance of cardiac disease has increased. Ivabradine is tolerated and may reduce symptoms, morbidity, and mortality in this cohort.

### Intracardiac echocardiography guided anatomical ablation of the arcuate ridge for drug refractory inappropriate sinus tachycardia [^115NpeF3]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2024). Low credibility.

Inappropriate sinus tachycardia (IST) is a common condition where treatments like beta-blockers or ivabradine are often not well tolerated, and ablation strategies carry a high rate of complications. This study describes an alternative anatomical approach to the modulation of the sinus node (SN).

- **Methods**: This retrospective study analyzes a case series of six patients from two centers who were diagnosed with symptomatic IST and underwent SN ablation.

- **Results**: The mean age of the patients was 40.6 ± 13.9 years. Among them, five out of six patients were female. All patients (100%) reported experiencing heart palpitations, while 66% reported dizziness. The average heart rate (HR) on a 24-hour Holter monitor was 93.2 ± 7.9 bpm. During the first stage of a stress test using the standard Bruce protocol, the HR was 150 ± 70 bpm. Post-ablation, the average HR on a 24-hour Holter was 75 ± 5.6 bpm, and during stage 1 of a Bruce protocol exercise stress test, the sinus rate HR decreased to 120 ± 10 bpm.

- **Conclusion**: This study is the first case series to report the acute and long-term results of a novel anatomical approach for SN modulation to treat IST. By targeting the arcuate ridge (AR) under intracardiac echography (ICE) guidance, the novel anatomic ICE-guided catheter ablation approach appears effective and safe. It aims to identify the earliest activation at the AR, with an extension of RF lesions toward its septal region, offering an efficacious solution for modulating the SN in symptomatic patients with IST refractory to medical treatment.

### Advances in cardiovascular pharmacotherapy. II. Ivabradine, an inhibitor of the hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channel [^115zY3vY]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2025). Low credibility.

Ivabradine selectively reduces heart rate by inhibiting the hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channel in the sinoatrial node. Unlike other medications that produce negative chronotropic effects, such as beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers, ivabradine does not affect systemic, pulmonary, and coronary hemodynamics. Despite several proof-of-concept clinical studies suggesting that ivabradine may exert anti-ischemic effects, two large randomized trials did not support its use in patients with chronic stable angina. Preliminary data also did not support the use of ivabradine in patients with acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction or acutely decompensated heart failure.

However, ivabradine improved outcomes in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), leading to its approval by the Food and Drug Administration, but the drug failed to show efficacy in those with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Ivabradine may also be useful in cardiac electrophysiology disorders characterized by tachycardia, such as inappropriate sinus tachycardia and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, but it has not yet gained wide acceptance for these indications.

In this article, the authors briefly review the structure and function of the cardiac HCN channel, discuss the development and actions of drugs including ivabradine that modulate the channel's activity, and describe in detail the potential clinical applications of ivabradine in patients with coronary artery disease, HFrEF and HFpEF, and cardiac electrophysiology.

### Brevibloc [^112rndtV]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Indications and usage**: Brevibloc injection is a beta-adrenergic blocker indicated for the short-term treatment of:

- **Control of ventricular rate in supraventricular tachycardia**: This includes atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter, as well as control of heart rate in noncompensatory sinus tachycardia.

- **Control of perioperative tachycardia and hypertension**: Brevibloc is used in these situations to manage heart rate and blood pressure effectively.

- **Supraventricular tachycardia or noncompensatory sinus tachycardia**: Brevibloc (Esmolol Hydrochloride) injection is indicated for the rapid control of ventricular rate in patients with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter in perioperative, postoperative, or other emergent circumstances where short-term control of ventricular rate with a short-acting agent is desirable. It is also indicated in noncompensatory sinus tachycardia where, in the physician's judgment, the rapid heart rate requires specific intervention. Brevibloc injection is intended for short-term use.

- **Intraoperative and postoperative tachycardia and/or hypertension**: Brevibloc (Esmolol Hydrochloride) injection is indicated for the short-term treatment of tachycardia and hypertension that occur during induction and tracheal intubation, during surgery, during emergence from anesthesia, and in the postoperative period, when the physician considers such specific intervention appropriate. The use of Brevibloc injection to prevent such events is not recommended.

### Ivabradine use in premature infants with accelerated idioventricular rhythm [^115vrLa9]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2025). Low credibility.

Ivabradine has been recently introduced to treat focal atrial tachycardia and junctional ectopic tachycardia in children. Its use for treating ventricular tachyarrhythmias, specifically accelerated idioventricular rhythm (AIVR), remains limited.

We report two cases of premature infants with AIVR successfully treated with ivabradine as monotherapy after other antiarrhythmic agents had failed. The first infant had a structurally normal heart, and the second infant had a truncus arteriosus. In both patients, sinus rhythm was restored with ivabradine. Side effects only consisted of brief, hemodynamically insignificant episodes of bradycardia.

Ivabradine represents a promising antiarrhythmic agent for treating AIVR in preterm infants. Its ability to maintain hemodynamic stability in this age group makes ivabradine an attractive option for managing AIVR, especially in the postoperative setting. Further research is warranted to explore the safety, dosage, and mechanistic action of ivabradine for AIVR in the premature, neonatal infant patient population.

### Predischarge initiation of ivabradine in the management of heart failure: Results of the PRIME-HF trial [^112JVr7T]. American Heart Journal (2020). High credibility.

Ivabradine is guideline-recommended to reduce heart failure (HF) hospitalization in patients with stable chronic HF with reduced ejection fraction (EF). The initiation of ivabradine following acute HF has had limited evaluation, and there are few randomized data in US patients. The Predischarge initiation of ivabradine in the management of heart failure (PRIME-HF) study was conducted to address predischarge ivabradine initiation in stabilized acute HF patients.

- **Methods**: PRIME-HF was an investigator-initiated, randomized, open-label study of predischarge initiation of ivabradine versus usual care. Eligible patients were hospitalized for acute HF but stabilized, with EF ≤ 35%, on maximally tolerated β-blocker, and in sinus rhythm with a heart rate ≥ 70 beats/min. Ivabradine was acquired per routine care. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients on ivabradine at 180 days. Additional endpoints included heart rate change, patient-reported outcomes, β-blocker use/dose, and safety events (symptomatic bradycardia and hypotension).

- **Results**: Overall, 104 patients (36% women, 64% African American) were randomized, and the study was terminated early because of funding limitations. At 180 days, 21 of 52 (40.4%) of patients randomized to predischarge initiation were treated with ivabradine, compared with 6 of 52 (11.5%) randomized to usual care (odds ratio 5.19, 95% CI 1.88–14.33, P = 0.002). The predischarge initiation group experienced a greater reduction in heart rate through 180 days (mean -10.0 beats/min, 95% CI -15.7 to -4.3 vs 0.7 beats/min, 95% CI -5.4 to 6.7, P = 0.011).

### 2022 AHA/ACC/HFSA guideline for the management of heart failure: A report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Joint Committee on Clinical Practice Guidelines [^1144pi8o]. Circulation (2022). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for heart failure, specifically with respect to ivabradine, the ACC/AHA/HFSA 2022 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of ivabradine to reduce heart failure hospitalizations and cardiovascular death in patients with symptomatic (NYHA class II-III) stable chronic HFrEF (LVEF ≤ 35%). These patients should be receiving guideline-directed medical therapy, including a β-blocker at the maximum tolerated dose, and have sinus rhythm with a heart rate of ≥ 70 bpm at rest.

### Efficacy of the I(f) current inhibitor ivabradine in patients with chronic stable angina receiving beta-blocker therapy: a 4-month, randomized, placebo-controlled trial [^111XqzKm]. European Heart Journal (2009). Low credibility.

The study aimed to evaluate the anti-anginal and anti-ischaemic efficacy of the selective I(f) inhibitor ivabradine in patients with chronic stable angina pectoris receiving beta-blocker therapy. In this double-blinded trial, 889 patients with stable angina who were receiving atenolol 50 mg/day were randomized to receive ivabradine 5 mg b.i.d. for 2 months, increased to 7.5 mg b.i.d. for a further 2 months, or placebo.

Patients underwent treadmill exercise tests at the trough of drug activity using the standard Bruce protocol for randomization, and at 2 and 4 months. Total exercise duration at 4 months increased by 24.3 ± 65.3 seconds in the ivabradine group, compared with 7.7 ± 63.8 seconds with placebo (P < 0.001). Ivabradine was superior to placebo for all exercise test criteria at 4 months (P < 0.001 for all) and at 2 months (P-values between < 0.001 and 0.018). Ivabradine in combination with atenolol was well tolerated, with only 1.1% of patients withdrawing owing to sinus bradycardia in the ivabradine group.

In conclusion, the combination of ivabradine 7.5 mg b.i.d. and atenolol at the commonly used dosage in clinical practice in patients with chronic stable angina pectoris produced additional efficacy with no untoward effect on safety or tolerability.

### 2021 ESC guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of acute and chronic heart failure [^116XBQng]. European Heart Journal (2021). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for heart failure, specifically concerning ivabradine, the ESC 2021 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of ivabradine to reduce the risk of heart failure hospitalization and cardiovascular death in symptomatic patients. This is particularly advised for those with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤ 35%, in sinus rhythm, and a resting heart rate (HR) ≥ 70 bpm who are unable to tolerate or have contraindications to a β-blocker. Additionally, initiate angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEis) or angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitors (ARNis), and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists in these patients.

### A pediatric case of cardiomyopathy induced by inappropriate sinus tachycardia: Efficacy of ivabradine [^114f9YLL]. Pediatric Cardiology (2011). Low credibility.

We report the case of a 16-year-old boy with cardiomyopathy induced by inappropriate sinus tachycardia (IST). The patient was resistant to treatment with conventional rate-decreasing medications. Therapy with the selective sinus node I(f) inhibitor ivabradine was started. After 3 months of ivabradine therapy, an improvement in ejection fraction and a successful decrease in heart rate were observed. No side effects occurred. We suggest that ivabradine, currently used to treat stable angina, could be considered as a second-line treatment in patients with symptomatic and refractory IST.

### The clinical use of ivabradine [^113fKr11]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

The clinical use of ivabradine has evolved based on its mechanism of action. It selectively inhibits the funny current (I_f) in sinoatrial nodal tissue, resulting in a decrease in the rate of diastolic depolarization and, consequently, the heart rate. This mechanism is distinct from other negative chronotropic agents. Ivabradine has been evaluated and is used in select patients with systolic heart failure and chronic stable angina without clinically significant adverse effects. Although not approved for other indications, ivabradine has shown promise in the management of inappropriate sinus tachycardia. Here, the authors review the mechanism of action of ivabradine and salient studies that have led to its clinical indications and use.

- **Drug interactions**:

	- **Agents known to impair cardiac contractility and conduction**:
		Using other agents known to affect cardiac conduction or contractility with diltiazem may increase the risk of bradycardia, AV block, and heart failure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2)]. Use of diltiazem increases exposure to ivabradine and may exacerbate bradycardia and conduction disturbances. Avoid concomitant use of ivabradine and diltiazem.

	- **Interactions with cytochrome P-450 3A4 substrates, inhibitors, and inducers**:
		Diltiazem is both a substrate and an inhibitor of the cytochrome P-450 3A4 enzyme system. For simvastatin, limit the daily dose to 10 mg and diltiazem to 240 mg, if co-administration is required [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Avoid coadministration of rifampin with diltiazem [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Clinical impact of complete atrioventricular block in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction [^111sgnVz]. Clinical Cardiology (2021). Low credibility.

Our study has several limitations. Firstly, we designed and performed this study in a single center. Secondly, we were unable to determine the precise onset or duration of complete atrioventricular block (CAVB) and recovery timing from CAVB due to the retrospective nature of the study. Thus, we could not distinguish effects attributable to transient versus sustained CAVB during hospitalization.

Since CAVB was diagnosed based on ECG reports after contact of the patients with emergency medical services, we may have missed transient CAVB before their contact, possibly leading to an underestimate of the incidence of CAVB. ECG was not continuously monitored during all periods of hospitalization; therefore, we might not have captured all CAVB episodes, particularly in patients with asymptomatic transient CAVB. Furthermore, information on bundle branch or bifascicular block, and the duration of CAVB was lacking.

Finally, because of consciousness disorder or severe condition in some patients, we could not interview all patients about previous medical therapy including beta-blocker use, which was associated with the development of bradycardia.

### Effects on outcomes of heart rate reduction by ivabradine in patients with congestive heart failure: is there an influence of beta-blocker dose? Findings from the SHIFT (Systolic Heart failure treatment with the I(f) inhibitor ivabradine Trial) study [^114BNLfr]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

This study utilized the SHIFT (Systolic Heart failure treatment with the I(f) inhibitor ivabradine Trial) database to assess the impact of background beta-blocker dose on response to ivabradine. In systolic heart failure, reduction in relatively high heart rates improves clinical outcomes when achieved with beta-blockers and is further enhanced by the addition of the sinus node inhibitor ivabradine.

Among patients with systolic heart failure, sinus rhythm, and a heart rate of ≥ 70 beats/min on recommended background therapy, maximally tolerated beta-blocker doses were subgrouped into categories: no beta-blocker, < 25%, 25% to < 50%, 50% to < 100%, and 100% of European Society of Cardiology–suggested target doses. The impact of ivabradine on cardiovascular death or heart failure hospitalization (primary endpoint) was analyzed in each subgroup as time-to-first event using Cox models adjusted for heart rate. The statistical models assessed heterogeneity and trend of the treatment effect across subgroups, and an additional analysis was made adjusting for the interaction of randomized treatment with baseline heart rate.

The primary endpoint and heart failure hospitalizations were significantly reduced by ivabradine in all subgroups with < 50% of the target beta-blocker dose, including no beta-blocker (p = 0.012). Despite an apparent trend towards a reduction in treatment-effect magnitude with increasing beta-blocker dose, no significant variation in treatment effect was observed in general heterogeneity interaction tests (p = 0.35). Across beta-blocker subgroups, the treatment effect was borderline.

### Atrial fibrillation associated with ivabradine treatment: Meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^1154whsR]. Heart (2014). Low credibility.

The study was performed in line with the recommendations of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement.

- **Eligibility criteria, information sources and search protocol**: We included in our analysis all randomized controlled double-blind trials of ivabradine, for any indication and of any size, which followed patients for at least four weeks. We did not exclude studies where atrial fibrillation (AF) incidence was not reported in the published manuscript, but attempted to identify that data wherever possible. We included both placebo-controlled studies and non-inferiority studies where an alternative drug treatment was used as a comparator. We excluded open or single-blinded studies, those with follow-up periods of less than four weeks, and studies where there was a significant risk of bias, as assessed by the methods recommended by the Cochrane Collaboration.

We performed a systematic search, without language restriction, for randomized clinical trials of ivabradine treatment for any indication, using the search term 'ivabradine' and the document type 'clinical trial' or 'randomized controlled trial' We searched Medline, Embase, and Web of Knowledge from 1980 to October 2013, as well as the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Additionally, we examined the reference lists of published trials, review articles, and meta-analyses to identify other eligible trials. We read the scientific discussions of the EMeA to identify safety data that were not published in the original trial report. We also contacted the authors directly and, in the case of industry-funded studies, attempted to gather further information.

### Brevibloc [^117WvrYJ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Brevibloc injection is administered by continuous intravenous infusion with or without a loading dose. Additional loading doses and/or titration of the maintenance infusion (step-wise dosing) may be necessary based on the desired ventricular response. In the absence of loading doses, continuous infusion of a single concentration of esmolol reaches pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic steady-state in about 30 minutes.

The effective maintenance dose for continuous and step-wise dosing is 50 to 200 mcg per kg per minute, although doses as low as 25 mcg per kg per minute have been adequate. Dosages greater than 200 mcg per kg per minute provide little added heart rate lowering effect, and the rate of adverse reactions increases. Maintenance infusions may be continued for up to 48 hours.

- **Intraoperative and postoperative tachycardia and hypertension**: In this setting, it is not always advisable to slowly titrate to a therapeutic effect. Therefore, two dosing options are presented: immediate control and gradual control.

	- **Immediate control**: Administer 1 mg per kg as a bolus dose over 30 seconds followed by an infusion of 150 mcg per kg per minute if necessary. Adjust the infusion rate as required to maintain desired heart rate and blood pressure. Refer to maximum recommended doses below.

	- **Gradual control**: Administer 500 mcg per kg as a bolus dose over 1 minute followed by a maintenance infusion of 50 mcg per kg per minute for 4 minutes. Depending on the response obtained, continue dosing as needed.

### Impact of ivabradine on the cardiac function of chronic heart failure reduced ejection fraction: Meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^114D95RP]. Clinical Cardiology (2021). High credibility.

This study was conducted according to standard article publication methods in medical journals and aligned with the Preferred Reporting Items for Meta‐Analysis (PRISMA) checklist.

- **Search strategy**: We systematically searched PubMed, Medline, Clinical, and The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for RCTs using the search terms "Ivabradine" (MeSH terms), "chronic heart failure", and "beta‐blocker", without any specific time restriction.

- **Inclusion/exclusion criteria**: The inclusion criteria for RCTs were:
	1. Studies on Ivabradine published in English.
	2. Chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF).
	3. The effect and safety of added Ivabradine (2.5–7.5 mg bid) compared to a control group receiving standard optimal medical treatment, including beta‐blockers, angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, diuretics, and aldosterone antagonists.
	4. Echocardiographic assessment.
	5. Evaluation of exercise tolerance and quality of life.

	- The exclusion criteria included:
	1. Non‐human studies.
	2. Articles in a language other than English.
	3. Lack of follow-up data.
	4. Studies on other types of heart failure.
	5. Absence of a comparison between intervention and control groups.

- **Outcomes**:
	- **Therapeutic effect**: The main outcomes were the effect of added Ivabradine treatment on chronic heart failure patients' heart rate (HR), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), left ventricular remodeling, exercise capacity, and quality of life (QoL). The evaluation index for reverse remodeling included the left ventricular end‐systolic diameter (LVESD).

### Successful treatment with ivabradine for haemodynamically unstable junctional ectopic tachycardia occurring early after ST-elevation myocardial infarction [^114bHJ9B]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). Low credibility.

JET can be classified based on its aetiology, including congenital, postoperative, and focal paroxysmal and non-paroxysmal forms. Focal JET, which often affects older children and adults, can manifest as either paroxysmal or non-paroxysmal forms. Non-paroxysmal JET is more common in adults and is characterised by a gradual onset and termination with HR of 70–130 beats/min. It is associated with myocardial ischaemia, digoxin toxicity, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, rheumatic carditis, electrolyte imbalances, and post-cardiac surgery. The potential mechanisms underlying focal JET involve increased automaticity within the AV node or triggered activity due to delayed posterior depolarization. The clinical course of adult JET is generally considered non-malignant and similar to other forms of supraventricular tachycardia. However, in our case, the compromised function of both ventricles, the loss of AV synchrony, and rapid ventricular rates had a significant impact on haemodynamics despite a modest increase in HR during JET compared with SR. Treatments for JET typically involve deep sedation, correction of electrolyte imbalances, discontinuation of catecholamine agonists, mechanical ventilation, fever avoidance, and surface cooling. If these protocols prove ineffective, a combination of atrial overdrive-pacing, pharmacotherapy, and hypothermia can be considered. In cases where JET remains refractory to these treatments, CA of the focal site can be an option. However, it is important to note that a recent multicentre study reported a high recurrence rate (53%) and a significant impact on haemodynamics.

### The cost effectiveness of ivabradine in the treatment of chronic heart failure from the U.K. National Health Service perspective [^114gPDk3]. Heart (2014). Low credibility.

A parametric model based on a Gompertz distribution was established as the best fit of the observed data based on statistical evidence (Akaike and Bayesian information), a visual review of Kaplan-Meier survival plots versus predicted curves, and the plausibility of predicted survival in the extrapolated, post-trial period (see online supplementary technical appendix). The parametric survival analysis predicted that mean survival for ivabradine patients with a heart rate ≥ 75 bpm would be 5.61 years compared with 5.86 years for standard care patients. Ivabradine was expected to improve patient survival duration by 0.25 years (approximately 3.0 months) compared with standard care. Our analysis suggests that, over 1 year, approximately 225 patients would need to be treated to prevent one HF death.

Quality of life scores for the base case analysis ranged from 0.82 to 0.46 for standard care patients and from 0.84 to 0.47 for ivabradine patients (based on NYHA classes I–IV, and no hospitalization event). QoL increased, on average, by 0.014 due to ivabradine therapy itself. However, hospitalizations were associated with a substantial temporary QoL loss, which varied according to NYHA class (−0.04 to −0.29; NYHA I–IV). Ivabradine therapy was also associated with a reduction in hospitalizations and hence avoided the potential QoL loss associated with these events.

Overall, in a lifetime analysis, ivabradine plus standard care was associated with a gain of 0.28 QALYs (approximately 3.4 quality-adjusted life months) versus standard care.

### Efficacy of the I(f) current inhibitor ivabradine in patients with chronic stable angina receiving beta-blocker therapy: a 4-month, randomized, placebo-controlled trial [^114bf9nq]. European Heart Journal (2009). Low credibility.

The primary efficacy criterion, change in total exercise duration at M4 in the full analysis set, increased by 24.3 ± 65.3 seconds in the ivabradine group compared with 7.7 ± 63.8 seconds in the placebo group (P < 0.001). More patients had an improvement of > 30 seconds in the ivabradine group (48%) than in the placebo group (34%, P < 0.001). There were also improvements with ivabradine treatment, relative to placebo, in all other exercise tolerance test (ETT) criteria at M4 (P < 0.001 for all).

- **Figure 3**: Changes in exercise tolerance test criteria between baseline and M2 visit and between baseline and end of study (M4) in the full analysis set.

- **Table 2**: Changes in exercise tolerance test criteria between baseline and end of study (M4) in the full analysis set.

Improvements in all ETT criteria, relative to placebo, were also seen in the ivabradine group at 2 months of therapy with ivabradine 5 mg b.i.d. (M2), although the changes were larger at the end of the study and with higher doses.

- **Table 3**: Changes in exercise tolerance test criteria between baseline and M2 visit in the full analysis set.

Ivabradine treatment produced dose-dependent reductions in heart rate and rate–pressure product, both at rest and at the peak of exercise at M4. Corresponding reductions were also seen at M2, with further reduction at M4 in each case.

- **Table 4**: Changes at M4.
- **Table 5**: Changes at M2 and further reduction at M4.

The frequency of angina attacks decreased significantly from baseline to M4 in both treatment groups, from 1.8 ± 3.3 to 0.9 ± 2.4 attacks/week in the ivabradine group, and from 1.6 ± 2.4 to 0.9 ± 2.1 attacks/week with placebo.

### Rationale and design of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled outcome trial of ivabradine in chronic heart failure: The systolic heart failure treatment with the I(f) inhibitor ivabradine trial (SHIFT) [^113anmiy]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2010). Low credibility.

Elevated heart rate is a significant marker for mortality and morbidity in cardiovascular disease, including heart failure. Despite background treatment with a beta-blocker, many patients with heart failure and low ejection fraction maintain a heart rate above 70 b.p.m. Ivabradine reduces heart rate directly through inhibition of the I(f) ionic current.

- **Methods**: SHIFT is a randomized, double-blind study designed to compare ivabradine with placebo on outcomes in patients with symptomatic chronic heart failure (NYHA class II-IV) and left-ventricular ejection fraction ≥ 70 b.p.m. The primary endpoint is the composite of the time to first event of cardiovascular death or hospitalization for worsening heart failure. Secondary endpoints include all-cause, cardiovascular and heart failure mortality, and hospitalization. The randomized treatment period lasts approximately 12–48 months. The study will include approximately 6500 patients and will continue until ≥ 1600 primary endpoints have occurred. The first patient was randomized in October 2006, and the study is expected to end in 2010.

- **Conclusion**: The SHIFT study will assess if a heart rate reduction by direct sinus node inhibition can reduce cardiovascular outcomes in patients with chronic heart failure and left-ventricular systolic dysfunction.

### hERG potassium channel blockade by the HCN channel inhibitor bradycardic agent ivabradine [^113DYBjD]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

Ivabradine has generally been considered to exhibit a good overall safety profile without significant effect on the heart rate corrected QT interval (QTc). Accordingly, ivabradine has been considered to have no "direct" propensity to produce torsades de pointes (TdP) arrhythmia, though as QT interval varies with rate, it is recommended that co‐administration of this bradycardic agent with known QT‐prolonging drugs should be avoided.

However, some concerns regarding the cardiac safety of ivabradine have recently been raised. In the SIGNIFY trial, which focused on patients with stable coronary heart disease without clinical heart failure, ivabradine was associated with an increase in the combined endpoint of the trial. This included death from all cardiovascular causes and nonfatal myocardial infarctions in patients with limiting symptoms of angina due to physical activity. Additionally, a recently published meta‐analysis of 11 clinical trials concluded that ivabradine treatment is associated with a 15% increase in the relative risk of atrial fibrillation, although the underlying mechanism for this is not clear.

Furthermore, in April 2014, ivabradine was added to the list of "drugs with a conditional risk" of TdP in the "CredibleMeds" database of QT interval–prolonging drugs. The update stated, "There is substantial evidence that ivabradine is associated with TdP when taken with other medicines that prolong the QT interval, diuretics, or drugs that block the metabolic breakdown of ivabradine, or in the presence of electrolyte abnormalities (low potassium or low magnesium)".

### Preserved autonomic cardiovascular regulation with cardiac pacemaker inhibition: A crossover trial using high-fidelity cardiovascular phenotyping [^114DE3PN]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

We expected to observe an ivabradine-related heart rate (HR) reduction by approximately 6 bpm. With a standard deviation (SD) of 6.7 bpm in the group's resting HR paired differences, α = 0.05, and two-sided testing, 15 participants would provide ≥ 80% statistical power to detect such a difference. We included additional participants to allow for meaningful analysis of secondary and exploratory endpoints. According to a prospective data analysis plan, primary and secondary endpoints were analyzed using the Hills-Armitage approach. This method allows period-adjusted therapy effect estimation, namely, the calculation of period-adjusted P values for mean differences between placebo and ivabradine data.

To appreciate the consistency of the results, several sensitivity analyses were performed, including univariate one-sample t-tests and mixed-model analysis with participant as a random effect. Exploratory variables were tested with t-tests for paired data and correlation analysis without adjustments for multiple testing. A value of P < 0.05 was considered significant. Unless otherwise indicated, data are expressed as mean ± SD.

### Vimpat [^113cQgQ5]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

VIMPAT should be used with caution in patients with underlying proarrhythmic conditions, such as known cardiac conduction problems (e.g. marked first-degree AV block, second-degree or higher AV block, and sick sinus syndrome without pacemaker), severe cardiac disease (such as myocardial ischemia, heart failure, or structural heart disease), and cardiac sodium channelopathies (e.g. Brugada Syndrome). VIMPAT should also be used with caution in patients on concomitant medications that affect cardiac conduction, including sodium channel blockers, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, potassium channel blockers, and medications that prolong the PR interval [see Drug Interactions (7.2)]. In such patients, it is recommended to obtain an ECG before beginning VIMPAT and after VIMPAT is titrated to a steady-state maintenance dose. Additionally, these patients should be closely monitored if they are administered VIMPAT through the intravenous route [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Drug Interactions (7.2)].

- **Atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter**: In the short-term investigational trials of VIMPAT in adult patients with partial-onset seizures, there were no cases of atrial fibrillation or flutter. However, both atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter have been reported in open-label partial-onset seizure trials and in postmarketing experience. In adult patients with diabetic neuropathy, for which VIMPAT is not indicated, 0.5% of patients treated with VIMPAT experienced an adverse reaction of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter, compared to 0% of placebo-treated patients.

### The rationale for repurposing funny current inhibition for management of ventricular arrhythmia [^115VWKyZ]. Heart Rhythm (2021). Low credibility.

Management of ventricular arrhythmia in structural heart disease is complicated by the toxicity of the limited antiarrhythmic options available. In others, proarrhythmia and deleterious hemodynamic and noncardiac effects prevent practical use. This necessitates new thinking in therapeutic agents for ventricular arrhythmia in structural heart disease. Ivabradine, a funny current (If) inhibitor, has proven safety in heart failure, angina, and inappropriate sinus tachycardia. Although it is commonly known that funny channels are primarily expressed in the sinoatrial node, atrioventricular node, and conducting system of the ventricle, ivabradine is known to exert effects on metabolism, ion homeostasis, and membrane electrophysiology of remodeled ventricular myocardium. This review considers novel concepts and evidence from clinical and experimental studies regarding this paradigm, with a potential role of ivabradine in ventricular arrhythmia.

### 2021 ESC guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of acute and chronic heart failure [^112i3jEh]. European Heart Journal (2021). High credibility.

The ESC 2021 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of ivabradine to reduce the risk of heart failure hospitalization and cardiovascular death in symptomatic patients. These patients should have a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of ≤ 35%, be in sinus rhythm, and have a resting heart rate (HR) of ≥ 70 bpm despite treatment with an evidence-based dose of β-blocker (or the maximum tolerated dose below that), ACE inhibitor (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor (ARNi), and a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist.

### Ponvory [^113jSrPZ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Obtain an ECG in all patients to determine whether preexisting conduction abnormalities are present. In all patients, a dose titration is recommended for the initiation of Ponvory treatment to help reduce cardiac effects [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

In patients with sinus bradycardia, first- or second-degree [Mobitz type I] AV block, or a history of myocardial infarction or heart failure with onset more than 6 months prior to initiation, first-dose monitoring is recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.3)]. Ponvory is not recommended in patients with a history of cardiac arrest, cerebrovascular disease (e.g. TIA, stroke occurring more than 6 months prior to treatment initiation), uncontrolled hypertension, or severe untreated sleep apnea, since significant bradycardia may be poorly tolerated in these patients. If treatment is considered, advice from a cardiologist should be sought prior to initiation in order to determine the most appropriate monitoring strategy.

Use of Ponvory in patients with a history of syncope or symptomatic bradycardia should be based on an overall benefit-risk assessment. If treatment is considered, advice from a cardiologist should be sought prior to initiation of treatment to determine the most appropriate monitoring. Experience with Ponvory is limited in patients receiving concurrent therapy with drugs that decrease heart rate (e.g. beta-blockers, non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers like diltiazem and verapamil, and other drugs that may decrease heart rate).

### Initiating ivabradine during hospitalization in patients with acute heart failure: A real-world experience in China [^115zV3ma]. Clinical Cardiology (2022). Low credibility.

The median duration from admission to initiation of ivabradine was six days (range: 2–11 days). More than half of the patients (35/63) were prescribed ivabradine in the first week of admission, including ten patients within 24 hours. In the group treated with ivabradine, the duration from admission to prescription was significantly correlated with in-hospital length of stay (R = 0.307, p = .014). The most common initial daily dose was 5 mg, followed by 10 mg per day. After at least 90 days of follow-up, the maximum daily dose of ivabradine was 10 mg for 52.4%, 5 mg for 36.5%, and 15 mg for 7.9%.

- **Description of ivabradine and β-blockers during the follow-up**: Durations from admission to adding ivabradine, initial dose and maximal dose of ivabradine at the 3-month follow-up, percentage comparisons of different doses of β-blockers between groups, and percentage comparisons of heart failure patients with a high dose of β-blockers at discharge, three months, and last follow-up.

During hospitalization, 76.2% of the ivabradine group and 95.2% of the reference group were treated with β-blockers. When comparing patients who did and did not receive ivabradine, 20.6% and 9.5% of them, respectively, received high doses of β-blockers (p = .135). After at least three months of follow-up, high doses of β-blockers were prescribed in 27% of the patients in the ivabradine group and 7.9% of the reference group.

### Kisqali [^117EQA6J]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Kisqali has been shown to prolong the QT interval in a concentration-dependent manner [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

- **QT interval prolongation**: Avoid Kisqali in patients who are at significant risk of developing Torsades de Pointes (TdP), including those with:

	- Congenital long QT syndrome
	- Uncontrolled or significant cardiac disease
	- Recent myocardial infarction
	- Heart failure
	- Unstable angina
	- Bradyarrhythmias
	- Uncontrolled hypertension
	- High degree atrioventricular block
	- Severe aortic stenosis
	- Uncontrolled hypothyroidism
	- Electrolyte abnormalities
	- Taking drugs known to prolong QT interval and/or strong CYP3A inhibitors as this may lead to prolongation of the QTcF interval

Based on the observed QT prolongation during treatment, Kisqali may require dose interruption, reduction, or discontinuation as described in Table 4 [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Drug Interactions (7.4)].

In patients with early breast cancer (NATALEE) who received 400 mg Kisqali plus NSAI, 8 out of 2494 patients (0.3%) had a > 500 ms post-baseline QTcF interval value, and 50 out of 2494 patients (2%) had a > 60 ms QTcF increase from baseline. QTcF prolongation was reversible with dose interruption. The majority of QTcF prolongation occurred within the first four weeks of Kisqali. There were no reported cases of Torsades de Pointes.

### Biventricular pacing for atrioventricular block and systolic dysfunction [^112tQicL]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2013). High credibility.

The study BLOCK-HF was published by Curtis AB and colleagues in 2013 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the diseases of atrioventricular block and heart failure.

- **Study question**: What is the role of biventricular pacing in patients with AV block and LV systolic dysfunction?
- **Study design**: Multi-center, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial (RCT).
- **Population**: The study included 691 patients (174 female, 517 male).
- **Inclusion criteria**: Patients with AV block, NYHA class I-III heart failure, and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤ 50%.
- **Exclusion criteria**: Key exclusions were previous receipt of a cardiac implantable electrical device, unstable angina, acute myocardial infarction, percutaneous or surgical coronary intervention within 30 days before enrollment, and valvular disease with an indication for valve repair or replacement.

- **Interventions**:
	- **Biventricular pacing (n = 349)**: Cardiac-resynchronization pacemaker or ICD with pacing of both ventricles.
	- **Conventional RV pacing (n = 342)**: Cardiac-resynchronization pacemaker or ICD with pacing of only the right ventricle.

- **Primary outcome**: A significant decrease in death, urgent care visit for heart failure, or ≥ 15% elevation in the LV end-systolic volume index (45.8% vs. 55.6%; HR 0.74, 95% CI 0.6 to 0.9).
- **Safety outcomes**: A significant difference in LV lead-related complications was observed (6.4%).

The conclusion from the BLOCK-HF study indicated that in patients with AV block with NYHA class I-III heart failure and LVEF ≤ 50%, biventricular pacing was superior.

### Evaluating the applicability of ivabradine in acute heart failure [^1134sdt3]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Low credibility.

Heart rate stands as an independent risk factor for mortality and cardiovascular events. Heart rate reduction can alleviate afterload, relieve left ventricular wall stress, and augment the left ventricle's stroke volume, thereby enhancing heart function and mitigating symptoms of cardiovascular diseases. While β‐blockers are pivotal for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), their application is curtailed by side effects such as compromised hemodynamics, diminished cardiac inotropy, and the potential to exacerbate symptoms linked to acute decompensated heart failure.

Ivabradine has recently been spotlighted as a potential therapy for HFrEF patients, especially those with sinus tachycardia. It selectively inhibits the pacemaker in the sinoatrial node, reducing heart rate without affecting myocardial contractility or blood pressure. This unique action stems from its role as a selective inhibitor of the hyperpolarization‐activated cyclic nucleotide‐gated channel in the sinoatrial node, modulating heart rate by decelerating pacemaker cell depolarization. Ivabradine effectively reduces the risk of hospitalization and mortality in patients with chronic HFrEF maintaining sinus rhythm. The SHIFT trial (Systolic Heart Failure Treatment with the I(f) Inhibitor Ivabradine Trial) demonstrated an 18% relative risk reduction in the primary endpoint of cardiovascular death or hospitalization for worsening HF with ivabradine compared with placebo. Subsequent studies showed significant improvement in the New York Heart Association functional class and quality.

### Antianginal and antiischemic effects of ivabradine, an I(f) inhibitor, in stable angina: a randomized, double-blind, multicentered, placebo-controlled trial [^112ZUpNQ]. Circulation (2003). Low credibility.

Heart rate reduction should benefit patients with chronic stable angina by improving myocardial perfusion and reducing myocardial oxygen demand. This study evaluated the antianginal and antiischemic effects of ivabradine, a new heart rate-lowering agent that acts specifically on the sinoatrial node.

- **Methods and results**: In a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 360 patients with a history of chronic stable angina (greater than or equal to 3 months) were randomly assigned to receive ivabradine (2.5, 5, or 10 mg BID) or placebo for 2 weeks, followed by an open-label 2- or 3-month extension on ivabradine (10 mg BID) and a 1-week randomized withdrawal to ivabradine (10 mg BID) or placebo. Primary efficacy criteria were changes in time to 1-mm ST-segment depression and time to limiting angina during bicycle exercise (exercise tolerance tests), performed at the trough of drug activity.

	- In the per-protocol population (n = 257), time to 1-mm ST-segment depression increased in the 5 and 10 mg BID groups (P < 0.005); time to limiting angina increased in the 10 mg BID group (P < 0.05). Deterioration in all exercise tolerance test parameters occurred in patients who received placebo during randomized withdrawal (all P < 0.02) but not in those still receiving ivabradine. No rebound phenomena were observed on treatment cessation.

- **Conclusions**: Ivabradine produces dose-dependent improvements in exercise tolerance and time to the development of ischemia during exercise. These results suggest that ivabradine, representing a novel class of antianginal drugs, is effective and safe during 3 months of use.

### Is ivabradine a wonder drug for atypical POTS [^116xhXXX]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). Low credibility.

Syncope is a sudden loss and gain of consciousness, traditionally caused by abnormalities in the neurological, cardiac, or vasovagal systems. We present a case of a 19-year-old woman experiencing recurrent syncopal episodes with no apparent cause. Examination and investigations were unremarkable for any etiology except positive tilt tests for postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS). The purpose of this report is to raise awareness among physicians about the unique presentation of this rare etiology with recurrent syncopal episodes and the novel management approach.

### Ivabradine use in critical care: A systematic review and meta-analysis of cardiogenic and septic shock patients [^116MZX4K]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). High credibility.

In this systematic review, we have reported the existing evidence on the use of ivabradine in critically ill patients requiring ICU admission for different clinical conditions. Persistent tachycardia, in the absence of left ventricular systolic dysfunction, is a common occurrence during septic shock and is often attributed to excessive native and pharmacologic adrenergic stimulation. This may lead to increased myocardial oxygen demand and the risk of ischemia. Catecholamines, although essential for the treatment of shock, partially contribute to the worsening of systemic inflammation. Prolonged exposure promotes desensitization, leading to the need for increasingly higher doses to achieve the same hemodynamic goals and consequently increasing the risk of side effects. Therapeutic options such as ivabradine could help limit adrenergic stress on the heart, potentially contributing to improved outcomes.

Use of ivabradine led to a significant reduction in heart rate (mean difference 18.70 bpm [12.60; 24.80]) without a significant decrease in cardiac index in the studies included in the meta-analysis. The resolution of inappropriate tachycardia likely increased the diastolic filling time, allowing stroke volume to rise and resulting in a reduction in cardiac workload and cardiac stress. Better cardiac efficiency was associated with vasopressor dose reduction in one study, though other studies did not consistently report vasopressor dose.

The mean heart rate reduction with ivabradine was comparable to that reported in previous studies using esmolol, suggesting a non-inferior efficacy in managing these patients.

### Efficacy of ivabradine administration in patients affected by inappropriate sinus tachycardia [^11715duU]. Heart Rhythm (2010). Low credibility.

Inappropriate sinus tachycardia (IST) is characterized by an elevated heart rate at rest and an exaggerated heart rate response to physical activity or emotional stress. Beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers are the first-line therapy but are sometimes poorly tolerated due to side effects.

- **Objective**: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ivabradine, a selective inhibitor of the I(f) current of the sinoatrial node, in patients affected by IST.

- **Methods**: Eighteen consecutive symptomatic patients (2 men and 16 women; mean age 45 ± 15 years) affected by IST were enrolled in the study. Every patient underwent resting ECG, 24-hour Holter ECG, and exercise ECG at baseline and at 3-month and 6-month follow-ups.

- **Results**: Sixteen patients (14 women; mean age 41 ± 14 years) completed the study. Holter ECG assessment showed a significant reduction in medium heart rate during a stress test at 3 months (75%) and 6 months (85%). One patient was excluded because of phosphenes despite dose lowering, and another patient did not complete the protocol.

- **Conclusion**: Ivabradine could represent an effective and safe alternative to calcium channel blockers for patients with IST.

### Vimpat [^115NhnQq]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2012). Low credibility.

- **Cardiac rhythm and conduction abnormalities**: PR interval prolongation is dose-dependent and has been observed with Vimpat in clinical studies involving both patients and healthy volunteers [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. In clinical trials with patients suffering from partial-onset epilepsy, an asymptomatic first-degree atrioventricular (AV) block was noted as an adverse reaction in 0.4% (4/944) of patients receiving Vimpat and 0% (0/364) of patients receiving placebo. In trials involving patients with diabetic neuropathy, the same adverse reaction was observed in 0.5% (5/1023) of patients on Vimpat and 0% (0/291) on placebo. Moreover, second-degree or higher AV block has been reported during the postmarketing experience in epilepsy patients. The concomitant use of Vimpat with other drugs that prolong the PR interval could lead to further PR prolongation. Patients need to be informed about the symptoms of second-degree or higher AV block, such as a slow or irregular pulse, lightheadedness, and fainting, and they should be instructed to contact their physician if these symptoms develop.

	- Vimpat should be administered with caution in patients with existing conduction issues, such as marked first-degree AV block, second-degree or higher AV block, and sick sinus syndrome without a pacemaker, or in cases of severe cardiac disease, including myocardial ischemia or heart failure. In such patients, it is advisable to perform an ECG before starting Vimpat and after stabilizing the dosage to ensure safety.

### 2023 ESC guidelines for the management of cardiovascular disease in patients with diabetes [^116PLcYx]. European Heart Journal (2023). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for diabetes mellitus type 2, particularly concerning patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), the ESC 2023 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of ivabradine. This recommendation aims to reduce the risk of heart failure hospitalization and cardiovascular death in patients with diabetes and HFrEF who are in sinus rhythm, have a resting heart rate of ≥ 70 bpm, and remain symptomatic despite treatment with β-blockers (at the maximum tolerated dose), ACE inhibitors/ARBs, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists.

### Atrial fibrillation associated with ivabradine treatment: Meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^115D9DWQ]. Heart (2014). Low credibility.

Our initial search strategy identified 84 published articles. We reviewed titles and abstracts, excluding papers that were not clinical trials, lacked sufficient duration of follow-up, or reported supplementary data from trials published elsewhere. The full text of the remaining 34 articles was assessed for eligibility. Eight papers required translation into English. After exclusions based on study design (one), follow-up duration (two), randomisation (nine), study blinding (ten), and duplication (two), our search yielded ten double-blind, randomised controlled trials. These trials enrolled 20,022 patients for a mean follow-up of 1.5 years (range 0.076–1.88), amounting to 30,090 patient-years of follow-up.

- **Risk of bias**: This is summarised in online supplementary table S1. Of the ten identified studies, AF incidence was only reported in one, the SHIFT trial. We reached out to authors of other studies to request unpublished AF data. Of the five studies not sponsored by the manufacturer, four authors responded with AF data. Authors of studies sponsored by the manufacturer did not provide AF data. Upon contacting the manufacturer directly, they declined to provide unpublished data, citing ongoing in-house analyses. However, full AF safety data for the BEAUTIFUL study was found on the EMeA website. The safety data from the ASSOCIATE study, reported in the EMeA documentation, does not include AF incidence.

### A case of atrial tachycardia treated with ivabradine as bridge to ablation [^114cqDkM]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2015). Low credibility.

Ivabradine is indicated in cardiac failure and ischemia to reduce sinus rate by inhibition of the pacemaker I(f) in the sinoatrial node. We report a case of an 18-year-old woman with left atrial tachyarrhythmia resistant to several antiarrhythmic drugs and to electric cardioversion, who responded only to ivabradine. This medication significantly reduced her heart rate without abolishing the arrhythmia itself. An ectopic focus in the ostium of the left pulmonary veins was found, and the patient was successfully ablated. We suggest that ivabradine might, therefore, be useful in the treatment of supraventricular tachyarrhythmias due to enhanced automaticity.

### Clinical efficacy of ivabradine in patients with inappropriate sinus tachycardia: a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover evaluation [^116X3u4t]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of ivabradine in the treatment of symptomatic inappropriate sinus tachycardia using a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design.

Due to its I(f) blocking properties, ivabradine can selectively attenuate the high discharge rate from sinus node cells, causing inappropriate sinus tachycardia.

- **Methods**: Twenty-one patients were randomized to receive placebo (n = 10) or ivabradine 5 mg twice daily (n = 11) for 6 weeks. After a washout period, patients crossed over for an additional 6 weeks. Each patient underwent symptom evaluation and heart rate assessment at the start and finish of each phase.

- **Results**: After taking ivabradine, patients reported elimination of > 70% of symptoms (relative risk: 0.25; 95% CI: 0.18 to 0.34; p < 0.001), with 47% of them experiencing complete elimination. These effects were associated with a significant reduction of heart rate at rest (from 88 ± 11 beats/min to 76 ± 11 beats/min, p = 0.011), on standing (from 108 ± 12 beats/min to 92 ± 11 beats/min, p < 0.0001), during 24 hours (from 88 ± 5 beats/min to 77 ± 9 beats/min, p = 0.001), and during effort (from 176 ± 17 beats/min to 158 ± 16 beats/min, p = 0.001). Ivabradine administration was also associated with a significant increase in exercise performance. No cardiovascular side effects were observed in any patients while taking ivabradine.

- **Conclusions**: In this cohort, ivabradine significantly improved symptoms associated with inappropriate sinus tachycardia and completely eliminated them in approximately half of the patients.

### The cost effectiveness of ivabradine in the treatment of chronic heart failure from the U.K. National Health Service perspective [^1125g5FY]. Heart (2014). Low credibility.

Ivabradine is a pure heart rate-lowering therapy that acts by selective and specific inhibition of the cardiac pacemaker via the I_f channel. The effect of using ivabradine to slow the heart rate in patients with systolic heart failure (HF), in addition to standard care medications including β-blockade, has been examined in a large, randomized, placebo-controlled trial: Systolic HF Treatment with the I_f Inhibitor Ivabradine Trial (SHIFT). This trial assessed 6,505 patients with symptomatic HF (New York Heart Association [NYHA] classes II to IV), sinus rhythm, and a left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) ≤ 35%. Participants had a prior hospitalization for HF within 12 months and a baseline resting heart rate ≥ 70 bpm despite optimized medical therapy.

Ivabradine therapy was associated with a significant reduction in the number of primary composite endpoint events compared with standard care (cardiovascular [CV] death or hospitalization for worsening HF; hazard ratio [HR]: 0.82; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.75 to 0.90, p < 0.0001). This result was driven primarily by a reduction in HF hospitalizations (first event worsening HF HR: 0.74; 95% CI 0.66 to 0.83, p < 0.0001) and HF death (HR: 0.74; 95% CI 0.58 to 0.94, p = 0.014). There was also a reduction in overall CV mortality (HF and other CV mortality HR: 0.91; 95% CI 0.80 to 1.03, p = 0.128); however, this result did not achieve statistical significance.

### Mayzent [^111J59n2]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Significant QT prolongation (QTc greater than 500 msec) and arrhythmias require treatment with Class Ia or Class III anti-arrhythmic drugs [see Drug Interactions (7.2)]. Conditions such as ischemic heart disease, heart failure, history of cardiac arrest or myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular disease, and uncontrolled hypertension should be considered. A history of second-degree Mobitz type II or higher AV block, sick-sinus syndrome, or sino-atrial heart block is noteworthy [see Contraindications (4)].

- **Treatment initiation recommendations**: Obtain an ECG in all patients to determine whether preexisting conduction abnormalities are present. In all patients, a dose titration is recommended for initiation of Mayzent treatment to help reduce cardiac effects [see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.3)]. In patients with sinus bradycardia (HR less than 55 bpm), first- or second-degree [Mobitz type I] AV block, or a history of myocardial infarction or heart failure, if not contraindicated, ECG testing and first-dose monitoring is recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.4) and Contraindications (4)].

Since significant bradycardia may be poorly tolerated in patients with a history of cardiac arrest, cerebrovascular disease, uncontrolled hypertension, or severe untreated sleep apnea, Mayzent is not recommended in these patients. If treatment is considered, advice from a cardiologist should be sought prior to initiation of treatment to determine the most appropriate monitoring strategy. Use of Mayzent in patients with a history of syncope or symptomatic bradycardia should be based on an overall benefit-risk assessment.

### Ivabradine use in critical care: A systematic review and meta-analysis of cardiogenic and septic shock patients [^113m1BKe]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Low credibility.

In patients with acute illness, compensatory tachycardia initially serves to maintain adequate cardiac output, oxygen delivery, and tissue oxygenation, but it may persist despite appropriate fluid and vasopressor resuscitation or may be secondary to inotropic therapy. Sustained tachycardia is a predictor of adverse outcomes in critical illness. Ivabradine, a highly selective inhibitor of the sinoatrial node's pacemaker current (I_f or "funny" current), mitigates tachycardia by modulating the diastolic depolarization slope without affecting contractility.

- **Aim**: To report the existing evidence on the use of ivabradine in critically ill patients and assess its effect on rate control.

- **Methods**: A systematic literature search was performed up to May 2024 in the MEDLINE/PubMed®, Cochrane Controlled Clinical Trial Register, EMBASE® and Scopus® databases. The search included:
	- P - Only original studies conducted in humans admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU);
	- I – When ivabradine administration was tested;
	- C – In presence or absence of a control group;
	- O – For any outcome;
	- S – Including case reports, randomized and observational trials, published in English in peer-reviewed journals.

- **Results**: After the first screening, 39 studies were assessed for eligibility out of a total of 682 records identified. Among those, 29 were excluded. Ten studies (four randomized controlled trials, five case reports/series, and one prospective observational study), including a total of 243 patients, were included in the qualitative analysis; six studies were included in the quantitative analysis.

### Ivabradine and outcomes in chronic heart failure (SHIFT): a randomised placebo-controlled study [^113KmDpa]. Lancet (2010). High credibility.

The SHIFT study, published by Swedberg K and colleagues in 2010 in the journal Lancet, addresses heart failure. The trial investigated the effect of ivabradine on heart-rate reduction in patients with chronic heart failure (HF). It was a multi-center, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial (RCT).

The study involved 6,505 patients, comprising 1,535 females and 4,970 males. Inclusion criteria required patients with symptomatic HF, a left-ventricular ejection fraction of less than 35%, sinus rhythm with a heart rate of 70 beats per minute or more, and a hospital admission for HF within the previous year. Key exclusion criteria included recent myocardial infarction (within less than 2 months), extensive ventricular or atrioventricular pacing, atrial fibrillation or flutter, and symptomatic hypotension.

- **Interventions**:
	- **Ivabradine group**: 3,241 patients, titrated to a maximum of 7.5 mg BID.
	- **Placebo group**: 3,264 patients, matching placebo BID.

- **Primary outcome**:
	- Significant decrease in cardiovascular death or hospital admission for worsening HF (24% vs. 29%; HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.90).

- **Secondary outcomes**:
	- Significant decrease in hospital admission for worsening HF (21% vs. 16%; HR 0.74, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.83).
	- Significant decrease in death due to HF (5% vs. 3%; HR 0.74, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.94).

- **Safety outcomes**:
	- Significant differences in serious adverse events (3,388 vs. 3,847, p = 0.025).
	- Symptomatic bradycardia (5% vs. 1%, p < 0.0001).
	- Visual side-effects (3% vs. 1%).
