## Question

A 72-year-old male is brought to the emergency department after a motor vehicle collision. He is found to have a pelvic fracture on initial imaging. On arrival, his blood pressure is 110/70 mmHg and heart rate is 92 bpm. He is alert and oriented. FAST exam is negative for intra-abdominal free fluid. A contrast-enhanced CT scan of the pelvis shows arterial contrast extravasation at the site of the pelvic fracture. There are no other injuries identified. The trauma team has already stabilized the pelvis with a binder and initiated hemostatic resuscitation. The surgical team is considering next steps in management.

Based on current WSES guidelines, what is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient's pelvic injury, and what is the rationale for your decision?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the most appropriate next step in managing a 72-year-old man with a pelvic fracture and arterial contrast extravasation on CT, who is hemodynamically stable and has no other identified injuries. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical significance of arterial contrast extravasation on CT in pelvic trauma. Then, I should verify how WSES guidelines interpret this finding and whether it changes management regardless of hemodynamics. Next, I will consider the patient's stability and whether that alters the indication for angioembolization. After that, I should review the role of pelvic stabilization and hemostatic resuscitation already in place. Finally, I will synthesize a clear recommendation and rationale, including any nuances about timing and adjuncts like preperitoneal pelvic packing or REBOA, and confirm the strength of evidence supporting that decision.

> Let me first confirm the meaning of the CT finding. Arterial contrast extravasation in the pelvis on contrast-enhanced CT is a direct sign of active arterial bleeding and is the most reliable predictor of the need for pelvic angiography and transarterial embolization, regardless of the patient's current hemodynamic status, which means this is not a "watch and wait" scenario even if the vitals look stable right now [^0b97fa6a] [^75849014] [^b536944c].

> Wait, let me verify the guideline stance on hemodynamics. I initially thought "stable patients don't need embolization", but that would be a mistake. WSES explicitly recommends considering angioembolization in patients with pelvic fracture who have evidence of arterial contrast extravasation on CT, regardless of hemodynamic status, and this is echoed by AAST/WSES vascular guidelines recommending angiography and embolization when contrast extravasation is present on CTA, so stability does not negate the indication here [^0b97fa6a] [^75849014] [^c141681b] [^c1738839].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should confirm the rationale. Most pelvic bleeding is venous or bony, but arterial sources, though a minority, are disproportionately responsible for rapid deterioration and mortality. CT evidence of arterial extravasation identifies a high-risk subset where early endovascular control changes outcomes, and elderly patients in particular can decompensate quickly despite initially stable vitals, reinforcing the need for proactive embolization in this scenario [^75795049] [^b536944c].

> Next, I should review what has already been done. The trauma team has applied a pelvic binder and initiated hemostatic resuscitation, which addresses venous and bony bleeding sources and provides temporary stabilization. However, binders do not control arterial hemorrhage, so the presence of arterial extravasation still mandates definitive arterial control via angioembolization to prevent delayed decompensation or rebleeding [^95ea6940] [^75795049].

> I need to ensure I'm aligning with the full algorithm. WSES places patients with arterial extravasation into a category where angioembolization should be considered after pelvic stabilization and exclusion of extra-pelvic sources of bleeding; here, FAST is negative and no other injuries are identified, so the next step is to proceed to angiography and embolization without delay, ideally in a hybrid room or with rapid access to IR, while continuing resuscitation and monitoring for any change in stability [^0b97fa6a] [^999dc00b].

> But wait, what if the patient deteriorates en route or angiography is delayed? In that case, I should double-check alternatives. If the patient becomes unstable or angiography is unavailable, preperitoneal pelvic packing combined with external fixation is an accepted damage-control strategy for venous and bony bleeding, yet it will not reliably control arterial sources, so packing is not a substitute for embolization when arterial extravasation is documented; REBOA may be considered only as a bridge in extremis, not as definitive therapy, and should be used judiciously given ischemia risk [^129082e0] [^72c12e2f] [^53221af0].

> Let me reconsider timing and logistics. Early angioembolization reduces transfusion requirements and complications in patients with arterial bleeding from pelvic fractures, and delays increase risk, particularly in older adults. Therefore, the most appropriate next step is to arrange emergent pelvic angiography with the intent to embolize the bleeding vessel(s), maintaining the binder and resuscitation until the endovascular team is ready [^b536944c] [^75795049].

> Final recommendation: Proceed directly to pelvic angiography and transarterial embolization for arterial hemorrhage control, because contrast extravasation on CT is an indication for embolization irrespective of current hemodynamic stability, and this strategy is supported by WSES and AAST/WSES guidelines as the definitive next step after initial stabilization and exclusion of other bleeding sources [^0b97fa6a] [^75849014] [^c141681b] [^c1738839].

---

The most appropriate next step is **urgent pelvic angiography with embolization** because arterial contrast extravasation on CT is a strong predictor of ongoing arterial bleeding and mandates definitive hemorrhage control regardless of current hemodynamics [^0b97fa6a] [^75849014]. Pelvic binders and hemostatic resuscitation are first-line but do not address arterial sources; angioembolization is the guideline-recommended definitive therapy in this scenario [^0b97fa6a] [^999dc00b]. Delay increases transfusion needs and complications, so **proceed without delay** once the patient is stabilized and other sources are excluded [^b536944c].

---

## Clinical significance of arterial contrast extravasation

Arterial contrast extravasation on CT is a **highly specific marker of active arterial bleeding** and correlates with the need for angioembolization, even in hemodynamically stable patients [^0b97fa6a] [^75849014]. In elderly patients, occult bleeding can progress rapidly; therefore, early intervention is critical to prevent deterioration [^b536944c].

---

## WSES guideline recommendations

The WSES provides clear guidance for this scenario: **angioembolization is indicated** when arterial contrast extravasation is present on CT, regardless of hemodynamic status [^0b97fa6a] [^75849014]. This reflects that arterial bleeding is a distinct, high-risk source that mechanical stabilization and resuscitation alone cannot control [^75795049].

---

## Rationale for angiography and embolization

- **Definitive hemorrhage control**: Angioembolization directly occludes bleeding arteries, achieving durable hemostasis [^0ba6443e].

- **Reduced transfusion requirements**: Early embolization decreases blood product use and complications [^b536944c].

- **Improved outcomes**: Timely embolization reduces mortality and length of stay in patients with arterial pelvic bleeding [^b536944c].

---

## Timing and prioritization

Urgent angiography should be arranged as soon as the patient is stabilized and other bleeding sources are excluded. Delays increase transfusion needs and complications, so **do not defer** once the diagnosis is made [^b536944c].

---

## Alternative interventions and their limitations

- **Preperitoneal pelvic packing (PPP)**: Effective for venous and bony bleeding but not for arterial sources; not indicated when arterial extravasation is documented [^1bcc853f].

- **Resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta (REBOA)**: A bridge in extremis, not definitive; not indicated here given stability and identified arterial bleeding [^53221af0].

- **External fixation**: Provides mechanical stability and reduces venous bleeding but does not control arterial hemorrhage [^cf5a834e].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Intervention** | **Indication** | **Role in this case** |
|-|-|-|
| Pelvic binder | Initial stabilization | Already applied |
| Hemostatic resuscitation | Control of venous/cancellous bleeding | Already initiated |
| Angiography/embolization | Arterial extravasation on CT | Urgently indicated |
| Preperitoneal packing | Venous/cancellous bleeding | Not indicated |
| REBOA | Extremis, unidentified source | Not indicated |

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

The most appropriate next step is **urgent pelvic angiography with embolization** because arterial contrast extravasation on CT mandates definitive arterial control. Pelvic binders and resuscitation are foundational but insufficient for arterial bleeding; proceed to embolization without delay to prevent deterioration and reduce complications [^0b97fa6a] [^75849014].

Notes on the use of the guidelines

The Guidelines are evidence-based, with the grade of recommendation also based on the evidence. The Guidelines present the diagnostic and therapeutic methods for optimal management of pelvic trauma. The practice Guidelines promulgated in this work do not represent a standard of practice. They are suggested plans of care, based on best available evidence and the consensus of experts, but they do not exclude other approaches as being within the standard of practice. For example, they should not be used to compel adherence to a given method of medical management, which method should be finally determined after taking account of the conditions at the relevant medical institution (staff levels, experience, equipment, etc.) and the characteristics of the individual patient. However, responsibility for the results of treatment rests with those who are directly engaged therein, and not with the consensus group.

### Pelvic trauma: WSES classification and guidelines [^50c77538]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Complex pelvic injuries are among the most dangerous and deadly trauma related lesions. Different classification systems exist, some are based on the mechanism of injury, some on anatomic patterns and some are focusing on the resulting instability requiring operative fixation. The optimal treatment strategy, however, should keep into consideration the hemodynamic status, the anatomic impairment of pelvic ring function and the associated injuries. The management of pelvic trauma patients aims definitively to restore the homeostasis and the normal physiopathology associated to the mechanical stability of the pelvic ring. Thus the management of pelvic trauma must be multidisciplinary and should be ultimately based on the physiology of the patient and the anatomy of the injury. This paper presents the World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) classification of pelvic trauma and the management Guidelines.

Conclusions

the management of pelvic trauma must keep into consideration the physiological and mechanical derangement. Critical and operative decisions can be taken more effectively if both anatomy of injury and its physiological and mechanical effects are considered.

Background

Pelvic trauma (PT) is one of the most complex management in trauma care and occurs in 3% of skeletal injuries. Patients with pelvic fractures are usually young and they have a high overall injury severity score (ISS) (25 to 48 ISS). Mortality rates remain high, particularly in patients with hemodynamic instability, due to the rapid exsanguination, the difficulty to achieve hemostasis and the associated injuries. For these reasons, a multidisciplinary approach is crucial to manage the resuscitation, to control the bleeding and to manage bones injuries particularly in the first hours from trauma. PT patients should have an integrated management between trauma surgeons, orthopedic surgeons, interventional radiologists, anesthesiologists, ICU doctors and urologists 24/7.

At present no comprehensive guidelines have been published about these issues. No correlation has been demonstrated to exist between type of pelvic ring anatomical lesions and patient physiologic status. Moreover the management of pelvic trauma has markedly changed throughout the last decades with a significant improvement in outcomes, due to improvements in diagnostic and therapeutic tools. In determining the optimal treatment strategy, the anatomical lesions classification should be supplemented by hemodynamic status and associated injuries. The anatomical description of pelvic ring lesions is fundamental in the management algorithm but not definitive. In fact, in clinical practice the first decisions are based mainly on the clinical conditions and the associated injuries, and less on the pelvic ring lesions. Ultimately, the management of trauma requires an assessment of the anatomical injury and its physiologic effects.

This paper aims to present the World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) classification of pelvic trauma and the treatment Guidelines.

WSES includes surgeons from whole world. This Classification and Guidelines statements aim to direct the management of pelvic trauma, acknowledging that there are acceptable alternative management options. In reality, as already considered for other position papers and guidelines, not all trauma surgeons work in the same conditions and have the same facilities and technologies available.

Flowchart showing our study patient population and the breakdown of the 3 groups. Figure 2. Pelvic computed tomographic scan of a 79-year-old woman receiving coumadin therapy who presented to the emergency department after a fall. Despite the fact that the plain pelvic radiographs did not identify any tissue, joint, or bone abnormalities, the pelvic computed tomographic scan with intravenous contrast showed a large right pelvic hematoma associated with a small superior pubic ramus fracture. The hematoma displaces the bladder to the left, and multiple foci of contrast extravasation are evident, indicative of active bleeding. On the angiogram, the right obturator artery was identified as the culprit bleeding vessel and successfully embolized with an absorable gelatin sponge. © 2025 Major pelvic fractures after trauma are often associated with bleeding, intra-abdominal injuries, and death.

1 The overall mortality from pelvic fractures depends on the associated injuries and ranges from 5% to 14%. 2–4 Severe hemorrhage from the disrupted venous and arterial vessels near the fractured structures accounts for the early mortality, although a direct association between the pelvic bleeding and death is hard to draw if multiple injuries are present. 4, 5 Several predictors, including fracture type, patient age, hemodynamic parameters, and laboratory values, have been described to identify those patients who may benefit from early angiography and embolization. 6, 7. Patients with SPFs who were admitted to the level 1 academic trauma center at Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, between January 1, 2002, and June 30, 2007, were retrospectively identified through our trauma registry. The SPFs were defined as fractures not requiring external or internal fixation.

Significant bleeding was defined as the need for blood transfusion and/or intervention for bleeding control within the first 24 hours after admission. The outcome of the study was SigBleed caused by SPFs. We collected data on demographics; mechanism of injury; injury severity score; 6 abbreviated injury scores; admission systolic blood pressure; heart rate; Glasgow Coma Scale; admission hematocrit; units of packed red blood cells; fresh-frozen plasma transfused during the first 24 hours after admission; CT scan findings; angiography and embolization; hospital length of stay; intensive care unit length of stay; and mortality. By definition, there were no type C fractures. Six patients in group C underwent angiography, and 5 proceeded to embolization. The mean hospital stay for the entire population was 8. 6 days, and 16 patients died.

In 3 patients, the pelvic bleeding was the cause of, or a significant contributor to, their death. An 83-year-old patient with SPFs, lower-extremity fractures, and upper-extremity degloving injuries died 24 hours after receiving multiple blood transfusions. A 91-year-old patient with SPFs and a humerus fracture underwent angiography, but no extravasation was found, and she did not undergo embolization. On posttrauma day 8, she died of multiorgan failure related to the initial bleeding. Finally, a 75-year-old multitrauma patient underwent massive resuscitation and bilateral internal iliac embolization twice. He developed abdominal compartment syndromes, requiring decompression. Despite successful control of the bleeding, he died on posttrauma day 10 for the same reasons as those of the previous patient.

Table 1
GRADE system to evaluate the level of evidence and recommendation

The discussion of the present guidelines has been realized through the Delphi process. A group of experts in the field coordinated by a central coordinator was contacted separately to express their evidence-based opinion on the different questions about the hemodynamically and mechanically unstable pelvic trauma management. Pelvic trauma patterns were differentiated into hemodynamically and mechanically stable and unstable ones. Conservative and operative management for all combinations of these conditions were evaluated. The central coordinator assembled the different answers derived from the first round and drafted the first version that was subsequently revised by each member of an enlarged expert group separately. The central coordinator addressed the definitive amendments, corrections and concerns. The definitive version about which the agreement was reached consisted in the published guidelines.

Mechanisms of injuries

Principal mechanisms of injuries that cause a pelvic ring fracture are due to a high energy impact as fall from height, sports, road traffic collision (pedestrian, motorcyclist, motor vehicle, cyclist), person stuck by vehicles. Ten to fifteen percent of patients with pelvic fractures arrive to the ED in shock and one third of them will die reaching a mortality rate in the more recent reports of 32%. The causes of dying are represented in the major part by uncontrolled bleeding and by patient's physiologic exhaustion.

Methods

Eight specific questions were addressed regarding the management of PT assessing the main problems related to the hemodynamic and the mechanical status:
Which are the main diagnostic tools necessary prior to proceed in hemodynamically unstable PT?
Which is the role of pelvic binder in hemodynamically unstable pelvic fracture?
Which is the role of Resuscitative Endovascular Balloon Occlusion of the Aorta (REBOA) in hemodynamically unstable pelvic trauma?
Which patients with hemodynamically unstable PT warrant preperitoneal pelvic packing?
Which patients with hemodynamically unstable pelvic ring injuries require external pelvic fixation?
Which patients with hemodynamically unstable PT warrant angioembolization?
What are the indications for definitive surgical fixation of pelvic ring injuries?
What is the ideal time-window to proceed with definitive internal pelvic fixation?

A computerized search was done by the bibliographer in different databanks (MEDLINE, SCOPUS, EMBASE) citations were included for the period between January 1980 to December 2015 using the primary search strategy: pelvis, pelvic, injuries, trauma, resuscitation, sacral, bone screws, fractures, external fixation, internal fixation, anterior e posterior fixation, hemodynamic instability/stability, packing, pubic symphisis, angioembolization, pelvic binder/binding, aortic, balloon, occlusion, resuscitative, definitive, stabilization combined with AND/OR. No search restrictions were imposed. The dates were selected to allow comprehensive published abstracts of clinical trials, consensus conference, comparative studies, congresses, guidelines, government publication, multicenter studies, systematic reviews, meta-analysis, large case series, original articles, randomized controlled trials. Case reports and small cases series were excluded. No randomized controlled trials were found. Narrative review articles were also analyzed to determine other possible studies. Literature selection is reported in the flow chart (Fig. 1). The Level of Evidence (LE) was evaluated using the GRADE system (Table 1).

MTP: Massive Transfusion Protocol, FAST-E: Eco-FAST Extended, ED: Emergency Department, CT: Computed Tomography, NOM: Non Operative Management, HEMODYNAMIC STABILITY is the condition in which the patient achieve a constant or an amelioration of blood pressure after fluids with a blood pressure > 90 mmHg and heart rate < 100 bpm; HEMODYNAMIC INSTABILITY is the condition in which the patient has an admission systolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg, or > 90 mmHg but requiring bolus infusions/transfusions and/or vasopressor drugs, or admission base deficit (BD) > 6 mmol/l, or shock index > 1, or transfusion requirement of at least 4–6 Units of packed red blood cells within the first 24 h)

Principles and cornerstones of the management

The management of pelvic trauma as for all the other politraumatized patients needs to pose in definitive the attention in treating also the physiology; decisions can be more effective when combining evaluation of anatomy, mechanical consequences of injury and their physiological effects. During daily clinical practice the first decisions are based mainly on the clinical conditions and the associated injuries, and less on the pelvic ring lesions. The management of trauma in fact aims firstly to restore the altered physiology. The main aims of proper PT management are bleeding control and stabilization of the hemodynamic status, restoring of the eventual coagulation disorders and the mechanical integrity and stability of the pelvic ring, and preventing complications (septic, urogenital, intestinal, vascular, sexual functions, walking) (×9); then to definitively stabilize the pelvis.

Physiopathology of the injuries

The lesions at the level of the pelvic ring can create instability of the ring itself and a consequent increase in the internal volume. This increase in volume, particular in open book lesions, associated to the soft tissue and vascular disruption, facilitate the increasing hemorrhage in the retroperitoneal space by reducing the tamponing effect (pelvic ring can contain up to a few liters of blood) and can cause an alteration in hemodynamic status. In the management of severely injured and bleeding patients a cornerstone is represented by the early evaluation and correction of the trauma induced coagulopathy. Resuscitation associated to physiologic impairment and to suddenly activation and deactivation of several procoagulant and anticoagulant factors contributes to the insurgence of this frequently deadly condition. The massive transfusion protocol application is fundamental in managing bleeding patients. As clearly demonstrated by the literature blood products, coagulation factors and drugs administration has to be guided by a tailored approach through advanced evaluation of the patient's coaugulative asset. Some authors consider a normal hemodynamic status when the patient does not require fluids or blood to maintain blood pressure, without signs of hypoperfusion; hemodynamic stability as a counterpart is the condition in which the patient achieve a constant or an amelioration of blood pressure after fluids with a blood pressure > 90 mmHg and heart rate < 100 bpm; hemodynamic instability is the condition in which the patient has an admission systolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg, or > 90 mmHg but requiring bolus infusions/transfusions and/or vasopressor drugs and/or admission base deficit (BD) > 6 mmol/l and/or shock index > 1 and/or transfusion requirement of at least 4–6 Units of packed red blood cells within the first 24 hours. The Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) definition considers as "unstable" the patient with: blood pressure < 90 mmHg and heart rate > 120 bpm, with evidence of skin vasoconstriction (cool, clammy, decreased capillary refill), altered level of consciousness and/or shortness of breath. The present classification and guideline utilize the ATLS definition. Some authors suggested that the sacroiliac joint disruption, female gender, duration of hypotension, an hematocrit of 30% or less, pulse rate of 130 or greater, displaced obturator ring fracture, a pubic symphysis diastasis can be considered good predictors of major pelvic bleeding. However unfortunately the extent of bleeding is not always related with the type of lesions and there is a poor correlation between the grade of the radiological lesions and the need for emergent hemostasis.

### The 2023 WSES guidelines on the management of trauma in elderly and frail patients [^b536944c]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Blunt abdominal trauma is uncommon in geriatric patients after a ground-level fall, unless the patient has a preexisting condition such as coagulopathy. However, when abdominal trauma does occur, this is related with a five-fold increase in the mortality rate when compared to younger patients. As clinical diagnosis of abdominal injuries is more challenging in the elderly than in the younger population, it is important to have a lower threshold for CT to diagnose intra-abdominal injuries in geriatric patients. This decreases the duration of hospital stay, ICU admission rates, mortality, and morbidity even in cases of high ISS. Moreover, Arruzza et al. demonstrated that whole-body CT as part of the trauma primary survey, in comparison to other conventional radiologic procedures, shortens time spent in the emergency department. These findings have relevant implications, entailing faster diagnosis time for definitive treatment and lessening the impact of emergency department overcrowding.

Approximately one in ten of admitted blunt trauma patients in trauma referral centers sustain pelvic fractures. Bleeding pelvic fractures are an immediate life-threatening injury, but early invasive monitoring, intervention with angiography, and prompt hemorrhage control are associated with improved survival. Contrast enhanced CT is the mainstay screening imaging for evidence of arterial bleeding in patients with pelvic fractures, and contrast extravasation is the most reliable predictor of the need for pelvic angiography and Trans-Arterial Embolization (TAE), regardless of hemodynamic status.

Surgical decision making remains challenging due to difficulty of determining the bleeding source. TAE and external fixation are the most common treatment strategies for hemorrhage associated with pelvic fractures, with early TAE aimed at establishing an effective means of reducing transfusion requirement, complications, and mortality from arterial hemorrhage, whereas low pressure bleeding from the pelvic venous plexus or fractured bone ends is best controlled through splinting, reduction of pelvic volume, and tamponade using external fixation.

### Pelvic trauma: WSES classification and guidelines [^75795049]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Since the 1980s, percutaneous trans-catheter angioembolization has been shown to represent an effective non-surgical measure of acute bleeding control in hemodynamically unstable pelvic fractures. Most published clinical guidelines recommend the use of early angioembolization, in conjunction with external pelvic fixation if indicated, as the main measure of acute bleeding control. As a counterpart it is important to consider a number of factors that are critical to decision-making. The exclusive use of angioembolization has been associated with a high mortality in patients with bleeding pelvic fractures, which was significantly reduced by application of a combined protocol with initial preperitoneal pelvic packing and subsequent (secondary) angioembolization, if indicated. It has been estimated that 85% of pelvic bleeding originates from bone, soft tissues, or major venous structures. In addition, as many as 90% of patients with unstable pelvic fractures will have significant associated injuries. Bleeding in the abdomen, chest, or extremities will contribute to shock and may require more urgent control than the pelvic bleeding. Thus, the fundamental management principles include aggressive hemostatic resuscitation, bony stabilization of the pelvis, and identification and management of extrapelvic bleeding. Management guidelines that emphasize these principles demonstrate improved outcomes. Pelvic Angiography/Angioembolization (AG/AE) is expected to benefit only a small minority of patients, and therefore should be employed once extrapelvic and non-arterial sources of bleeding are controlled. Arterial contrast extravasation seen on CT scan is a good indicator of the need for pelvic AG/AE. In contrast, fracture pattern alone has not been predictive of who will require angiography. Pelvic AG/AE is very effective in controlling hemorrhage. However, some patients will continue to bleed and repeat AG/AE has been found to be an effective strategy. Elderly patients have been found to require AG/AE more frequently than younger adults, regardless of apparently normal hemodynamics at presentation, even in mechanical stable-low risk fractures. Therefore, AG/AE should be considered in these patients even when there is low suspicion of pelvic bleeding.

Role of Angioembolization in hemodynamic unstable pelvic fractures

- Angioembolization is an effective measure of haemorrhage control in patients with arterial sources of retroperitoneal pelvic bleeding [Grade 1A].
- CT-scan demonstrating arterial contrast extravasation in the pelvis and the presence of pelvic hematoma are the most important signs predictive of the need for angioembolization [Grade 1C].
- After pelvic stabilization, initiation of aggressive hemostatic resuscitation and exclusion of extra-pelvic sources of blood loss, patients with pelvic fractures and hemodynamic instability or evidence of ongoing bleeding should be considered for pelvic angiography/angioembolization [Grade 2A].
- Patients with CT-scan demonstrating arterial contrast extravasation in the pelvis may benefit from pelvic angiography/angioembolization regardless of hemodynamic status [Grade 2A].
- After extra-pelvic sources of blood loss have been ruled out, patients with pelvic fractures who have undergone pelvic angiography with or without angioembolization, with persisting signs of ongoing bleeding, should be considered for repeat pelvic angiography/angioembolization [Grade 2B].
- Elderly patients with pelvic fractures should be considered for pelvic angiography/angioembolization regardless of hemodynamic status [Grade 2C].

Morbidity, mortality and outcomes

Complications with important functional limitations are present especially in patients with open PT who may have chronic sequelae as fecal and urinary incontinence, impotence, dyspareunia, residual disability in physical functions, perineal and pelvic abscess, chronic pain and vascular complications as embolism or thrombosis.

The majority of deaths (44.7%) occurred on the day of trauma and the main factors that correlate with mortality are increasing age, ISS, pelvic ring instability, size and contamination of the open wound, rectal injury, fecal diversion, numbers of blood units transfused, head Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS), admission base deficit.

Lastly, a recent study reported the impact given by the multidisciplinary approach resulting in an improvement in performance and in patient outcomes. At first a defined decision making algorithm reduce significantly (p = 0.005) the time from hospital arrival and bleeding control in the theatre with PPP. Furthermore the definition of a massive hemorrhage protocol reduced significantly the use of liquids administered prior blood transfusions and rationalized the use of packed red cells and fresh frozen plasma (ratio 2:1) starting within the first hours following injury. Moreover a dedicated pelvic orthopedic surgeons can improve (p = 0.004) the number of patients that undergoing definitive unstable pelvic fractures repair with a consequently improvement in outcome. Similar data about the importance of the adherence to defined guidelines have been reported by Balogh et al. and recently confirmed by the multi-institutional trial by Costantini et al.

### Hemorrhage control interventions and mortality in trauma patients with hemodynamically unstable pelvic fractures… [^d2ea7711]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

In this cohort study, a retrospective review was performed of data from the 2017 American College of Surgeons Trauma Quality Improvement Program database, a national multi-institutional database of trauma patients in the United States. Adult patients with pelvic fractures who received early transfusions and underwent intervention for pelvic hemorrhage control were identified. Main Outcomes and Measures Primary outcomes were rates of 24-hour, emergency department, and in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes were major in-hospital complications. Results. A total of 1396 patients were identified. Mean age was 47 years, 975 were male, and the mean lowest systolic blood pressure was 71 mm Hg. The median Injury Severity Score was 24, with a 24-hour mortality of 217 patients, ED mortality of 10 patients, in-hospital mortality of 501 patients, and complication rate of 574 patients. We included all adult patients who presented with pelvic fractures, received 4 or more units of packed red blood cells within 4 hours of presentation, and underwent at least 1 pelvic fracture hemorrhage control intervention. Interventions were pelvic AE, preperitoneal PP, and REBOA zone 3. We excluded patients who were transferred from other institutions or dead on arrival. We abstracted the following data points. Demographic data included age, sex, body mass index, and race as captured and classified according to the National Trauma Data Standard, which prioritizes self- or family-reported race identification.

We captured emergency department vital signs that included systolic blood pressure, pulse rate, respiratory rate, Glasgow Coma Scale score, and injury characteristics. Comorbidities included diabetes, hypertension, myocardial infarction, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic kidney disease, cirrhosis, current smoking status, and preinjury anticoagulation. Hospital-related data included ACS trauma center verification level, type and timing of intervention for pelvic fracture hemorrhage control, venous thromboembolism prophylaxis, intensive care unit and hospital length of stay, days spent on a ventilator, transfusion parameters, in-hospital complications, and mortality.

Primary outcomes included rates of 24-hour, ED, and in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes were major in-hospital complications, including cardiac, infectious, respiratory, and venous thromboembolic complications. To control for confounders, we performed multivariate backward stepwise, binary logistic, and linear regression analyses. Potential confounders were entered into the model based on existing literature and univariate analysis demonstrating P <. 05.

In blunt posterior urethral injuries, initial conservative treatment is recommended with planned delayed surgical treatment, allowing multidisciplinary management involving experienced surgeons and urologists.

In case of hemodynamically stable patients with complete lesions of the posterior urethra without other life-threatening injuries, immediate endoscopic realignment is preferred over immediate urethroplasty. Endoscopic realignment is associated with improved outcomes. Therefore, immediate urethroplasty is not routinely recommended. When endoscopic realignment is unsuccessful, urinary drainage with suprapubic catheter placement and delayed urethroplasty are indicated, preferably within 14 days from the injury. In case of associated pelvic fractures, definitive surgery should be postponed until after the healing of pelvic ring injuries.

The management of penetrating injuries to the posterior urethra depends on the presence and severity of associated injuries. In case of life-threatening associated injuries and Damage Control approach, urinary diversion and delayed urethroplasty is advised. In hemodynamic stable patients, without associated severe injuries, immediate retropubic exploration and primary repair of the injury is recommended.

Follow-up:
Follow-up imaging is not required for minor (AAST I-II) renal injuries managed non-operatively. (GoR 2B)
In moderate (AAST III) and severe (AAST IV-V) renal injuries, the need for follow-up imaging is driven by the patients' clinical conditions. (GoR 2B)
In severe injuries (AAST IV-V), contrast-enhanced CT scan with excretory phase (in cases with possible or documented urinary extravasation) or ultrasound and contrast-enhanced US are suggested within the first 48 h after trauma in adult patients and in delayed follow-up. (GoR 2A)
Follow-up imaging in pediatric patients should be limited to moderate (AAST III) and severe (AAST IV-V) injuries. (GoR 2B)
In pediatric patients, ultrasound and contrast-enhanced US should be the first choice in the early and delayed follow-up phases. If cross-sectional imaging is required, magnetic resonance should be preferred. (GoR 2B)

Discussion

International validation of the WSES classification for open pelvic fracture patients

Bony structure instability and internal hemorrhage can mostly be conservatively managed in closed pelvic fracture patients; however, the management of patients with open pelvic fractures can be challenging and requires a multidisciplinary approach. In addition to stopping concomitant external and internal hemorrhage, the difficulty of open pelvic fracture treatment includes the management of severe wound infection and further sepsis and multiple organ failure. The WSES guidelines suggest that the management of pelvic trauma must consider physiological and mechanical derangement. An international validation using the National Trauma Data Bank proved that the WSES guidelines were an accurate and reproducible classification system for pelvic injuries. However, for open pelvic fractures, which are more dangerous than closed fractures, it is important to evaluate whether the WSES guidelines are still accurate and applicable.

In the current study, the accuracy of the WSES classification system for evaluating mortality in open pelvic fracture patients was validated by using the NTDB. The mortality rates associated with minor injury, moderate injury and severe injury were 3.5%, 11.2% and 23.8%, respectively. The odds of mortality also increased significantly from minor injury to severe injury (Fig. 1 and Table 1). Moreover, after excluding mortality patients, the hospital LOS also increased significantly as the class of injury increased from minor injury to severe injury in open pelvic injury patients. (Most patients with severe injuries may die within a few days because of uncontrolled hemorrhage or other associated injuries. Therefore, it is unfair to evaluate the LOS using all studied patients with both survivors and nonsurvivors.) Although there are differences between open and closed pelvic fractures, this nationwide study showed that the WSES guidelines still serve as a good evaluation modality.

Minor (WSES class I)
Moderate (WSES class II)
Severe (WSES class III and IV)

Statements summary

Minor kidney injuries:
WSES class I includes hemodynamically stable AAST-OIS grade I–II blunt and penetrating lesions.

Moderate kidney injuries:
WSES class II includes hemodynamically stable AAST-OIS grade III blunt and penetrating lesions.

Severe kidney injuries:
WSES class III includes hemodynamically stable AAST-OIS grade IV–V blunt and penetrating lesions and any grade parenchymal lesion with arterial dissection/occlusion.
WSES class IV includes hemodynamically unstable AAST-OIS grade I–V blunt and penetrating lesions

Based on the present classification, WSES and AAST suggest a management algorithm for kidney injury shown in Fig. 3 and for urogenital tract injuries in Fig. 4.

Patient stratification

During the initial evaluation the hemodynamic status, mechanism of injury, presence of associated injuries, and anamnestic data must be considered (i.e. previous renal injuries, previous renal surgery, congenital single or pathologic kidneys or diseases), especially in children.

In adults, the clinical examination in urogenital trauma should consider the presence of hematuria, flank/abdominal pain/contusion, rib fractures, and mechanism of trauma. Special attention should be given to pelvic trauma in which urethral injuries can be frequently missed but should ideally be diagnosed in the first hours. Macro or micro-hematuria is frequently present (88–94%) in cases of renal/urogenital trauma but it does not predict the grade of injury. Macro-hematuria is more frequently associated with major renal injuries; however, in 10–25% of high-grade kidney injury hematuria is, the same being observed in 24–50% of ureteropelvic junction and renal hilum injuries. In 0.1–0.5% of the patients, hemodynamic stability and micro-hematuria exist in the presence of a significant urinary tract injury.

Assess the patient's airway- Is the patient's airway open. If the patient is unresponsive stabilize the head and neck and use the jaw-thrust maneuver to ensure an open airway. If you do not suspect a spine injury use the head tilt, chin lift maneuver. Assess the patients breathing- Is the patient breathing adequately. With the airway open, place your ear over the patient's nose and mouth and watch for chest movement, note symmetry or lack of symmetry in chest movement. Listen and feel for the presence of exhaled air. Listen to the quality of the breath sounds. Sporadic respirations are called agonal respirations and occur just prior to death. Assess the patient's circulation
- Does the patient have an adequate pulse. Is there serious bleeding. Did the patient lose a large quantity of blood prior to your arrival.
- If the patient is not breathing check the pulse at the neck.
- If the patient is breathing you can check the carotid or the pulse at the wrist
- If you document the presence of a carotid pulse but the radial pulse is absent this may represent a shock situation. A rapid or weak pulse may also represent a shock situation.
- Although any uncontrolled bleeding may become life threatening, you are only concerned with profuse bleeding during the initial assessment
- Blood that is bright red and spurting may be coming from an artery
- Flowing blood that is darker in color typically reflects a venous origin
- Your concern is for the total amount of blood lost, not just how fast or slow the bleeding is. Usually when an adult goes into shock they typically worsen gradually and the downward trend can be spotted in time to take appropriate actions. However, an infant's or child's body can compensate so well for a problem such as blood loss the he may appear stable for some time, and then suddenly become much worse.

Children can actually maintain their blood pressure up to the time when almost half of their total blood volume is loss. Therefore a normal blood pressure may not rule out the presence of shock. A delayed capillary refill time may be a more reliable indicator of circulatory compromise. Focused History and Physical Exam A focused history and physical exam should be performed after the initial assessment. It is assumed that the life-threatening problems have been found and corrected. If you have a patient with a life-threatening problem that requires intervention you may not get to this component. The main purpose of the focused history and physical is to discover and care for a patient's specific injuries or medical problems.

### Pelvic trauma: WSES classification and guidelines [^129082e0]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Retrospective observational studies revealed that the implementation of standardized multidisciplinary clinical guidelines that include early surgical management with pelvic external fixation and direct PPP for hypotensive patients with hemodynamical and mechanical unstable pelvic ring injuries led to a significant decrease of transfused blood products and to a significantly decreased post-injury mortality. More recent observational studies confirmed the notion that extraperitoneal pelvic packing is a safe and fast procedure associated with a significantly reduced mortality in hemodynamically unstable patients with pelvic fractures, compared to patients managed by conventional measures without pelvic packing.

In hemodynamically and mechanically unstable pelvic fractures, PPP should be performed along with external fixation. Cothren et al. showed that external fixation and PPP could be sufficient to control bleeding in severely injured patients with pelvic fractures, reporting that only 13% of patients required a subsequent angioembolization for an arterial blush. In very sick patients, pelvic ring stabilization can be rapidly obtained by pelvic binder, with posterior compression using rolled surgical towels under the binder in sacro-iliac disruption.

Subsequent (secondary) angioembolization is recommended in the selected cohort of patients with ongoing hemorrhage and/or transfusion requirements after the pelvic packing procedure. The need for angioembolization following PPP has been reported to be between 13 and 20%. However, Totterman et al. reported that 80% of patients who underwent PPP had positive findings for arterial injury at angiography.

PPP has been proposed as an alternative to angiography. Some papers compared the use of PPP vs. Angioembolization. In a recent a prospective quasi-randomized trial Li et al. showed that time-to-procedure and procedure time were significantly shorter in the PACK group than in the ANGIO one. The need for packed red cells in the first 24 h after procedure, the need for complementary procedures (angiography or PPP), mortality rates did not differ between the two groups. Present guidelines recommend considering angiography and PPP as complementary procedures.

### Anorectal emergencies: WSES-AAST guidelines [^c82b9e24]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Anorectal emergencies comprise a wide variety of diseases that share common symptoms, i.e., anorectal pain or bleeding and might require immediate management. While most of the underlying conditions do not need inpatient management, some of them could be life-threatening and need prompt recognition and treatment. It is well known that an incorrect diagnosis is frequent for anorectal diseases and that a delayed diagnosis is related to an impaired outcome. This paper aims to improve the knowledge and the awareness on this specific topic and to provide a useful tool for every physician dealing with anorectal emergencies. The present guidelines have been developed according to the GRADE methodology. To create these guidelines, a panel of experts was designed and charged by the boards of the World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) and American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST) to perform a systematic review of the available literature and to provide evidence-based statements with immediate practical application. All the statements were presented and discussed during the WSES-AAST-WJES Consensus Conference on Anorectal Emergencies, and for each statement, a consensus among the WSES-AAST panel of experts was reached. We structured our work into seven main topics to cover the entire management of patients with anorectal emergencies and to provide an up-to-date, easy-to-use tool that can help physicians and surgeons during the decision-making process.

### Pelvic injury prognosis is more closely related to vascular injury severity than anatomical fracture complexity: the WSES classification for pelvic trauma makes sense [^c9d820a4]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

In 2017, the World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) published its guidelines for the classification and management of pelvic trauma. The WSES guidelines emphasize that the optimal treatment strategy should be determined by the hemodynamic status and associated injuries in addition to anatomical lesions. The first decisions are based mainly on the hemodynamic conditions rather than on the pelvic ring lesions. According to the WSES classification, minor pelvic injuries are defined as those with mechanically stable (LC type I, APC type I) and hemodynamically stable lesions, while moderate injuries comprise those with mechanically unstable fracture (LC type II–III, APC type II–III, VS, and combined type fractures) but hemodynamically stable lesions. In addition, severe pelvic injuries are defined as hemodynamically unstable lesions independent of mechanical status. While the main differences between minor and moderate injuries are the complexity of the fracture patterns, any fractures that are associated with unstable hemodynamics are categorized as severe injuries. Our results showed that patient outcomes were similar between the WSES mild and moderate types of pelvic injuries; however, patients with severe pelvic injuries had significantly worse outcomes than those with the other two types of injuries. Therefore, hemodynamic instability appears to be a more relevant factor than the complexity of the fracture pattern for patient outcome. These results suggest that the WSES classification, which takes both the fracture pattern and hemodynamic status into consideration, might be clinically more useful than the classic YB classification system.

Role of Pre-peritoneal Pelvic Packing in hemodynamically unstable pelvic fractures

- Patients with pelvic fracture-related hemodynamic instability should always be considered for pre-peritoneal pelvic packing, especially in hospitals with no angiography service [Grade 1C].
- Direct preperitoneal pelvic packing represents an effective surgical measure of early haemorrhage control in hypotensive patients with bleeding pelvic ring disruptions [Grade 1B].
- Pelvic packing should be performed in conjunction with pelvic stabilization to maximize the effectiveness of bleeding control [Grade 2A].
- Patients with pelvic fracture-related hemodynamic instability with persistent bleeding after angiography should always be considered for pre-peritoneal pelvic packing [Grade 2A].
- Pre-peritoneal pelvic packing is an effective technique in controlling hemorrhage in patients with pelvic fracture-related hemodynamic instability undergone prior anterior/C-clamp fixation [Grade 2A].

The main source of acute retroperitoneal hemorrhage in patients with hemodynamically unstable pelvic ring disruptions is attributed to venous bleeding in 80%–90% of all cases, originating from presacral and paravesical venous plexus and from bleeding cancellous bone surfaces from sacral and iliac fractures and sacro-iliac joint disruptions. Only 10%–20% of all pelvic bleeding sources are arterial. Arterial bleeding may be predominant in patients with persistent hemodynamic instability after mechanical stabilization. Moreover, when arterial bleeding is present, the likelihood of concomitant venous bleeding is close to 100%. Since venous bleeding sources are inadequately managed by angio-embolization, studies have shown that the traditional ATLS-guided management of hemodynamically unstable pelvic ring injuries with angio-embolization results in poor patient outcomes with high post-injury mortality rates greater than 40%. The notion of a mainly venous retroperitoneal bleeding source in pelvic fractures provides the main rationale for pelvic packing for acute surgical hemorrhage control.

Discussion

Validation of the WSES classification using nationwide real-world data

In 2017, a novel classification of pelvic fracture that considered both the anatomy of the injury and physiological status was published by the WSES. Different from previous classifications based only on mechanical fracture patterns, this classification also considered hemodynamic stability. With these guidelines, the evaluation of outcomes became more accurate, and critical decisions could be made more effectively. The results of the current nationwide study validated the reliability and feasibility of the 2017 WSES classification system (Table 1). Furthermore, two points (associated vascular injury and open fracture) that could potentially reinforce this guideline were also observed.

The association of vascular injury and pelvic ring stability in the WSES classification

Per the WSES classification, minor and moderate injuries were distinguished using mechanical stability. It has been suggested that unstable pelvic fractures are associated with a higher probability of retroperitoneal hemorrhage because they tend to be associated with higher energy. It was reported that the incidence of major ligament disruption-related vascular injury ranged from 18 to 62.5%. Therefore, unstable pelvic fracture is usually thought to be a more severe pelvic injury. However, vascular injury was also found in 7–10% of stable pelvic fractures, which have often been considered minor injuries and are normally treated conservatively. Some of these fractures even require angioembolization to achieve hemostasis. Not only mechanical stability but also associated vascular injury should be evaluated in the management of pelvic fracture. Wu et al. reported that vascular injury severity is more closely correlated with the outcome than the type of anatomical fracture of the pelvis. Our previous study, which was based on a single institution experience, also showed that the role of pelvic stability is not significant when evaluating associated hemorrhage in the management of patients with pelvic fracture.

- the vascular access for REBOA, because of a functional femoral artery access must be gained first and it's still remained to be answered who should do it and at what stage and localization should it be done. As a main rule only qualified experienced people should do this; as a counterpart however any surgeon who also does ICU or vascular should be facile at these. Lastly it must be kept in mind that having an arterial line bring some additional issues to manage: on one hand when placed it needs to be connected to ulterior lines (i.e. fluids, cable, etc.) on the other hand it also provides the most accurate blood pressure readings.

- the estimated source of bleeding is crucial for determination of REBOA zone placement. For pelvic bleeding, zone III is postulated to be preferred.

Moreover there are some major limitations to REBOA. As mentioned, REBOA is only a temporary solution and a definitive bleeding control must follow. One of the major problems of REBOA is the ischemia-reperfusion organ injury followed by multiple organ failure that might be prevented by short REBOA time, intermittent REBOA (iREBOA), Zone III REBOA and new methods as partial REBOA (pREBOA) described lately.

The insertion of REBOA is not free from risks. During maneuvers inside emergency room in a hemodynamically unstable patient, it can be time-consuming to obtain percutaneous, or US guided, or surgically exposed femoral access. Vascular injuries can be present in severe pelvic injuries or otherwise produced particularly in elderly with calcific vessels and, nowadays, most trauma surgeons reserve REBOA only in patients in extremis, with multiple sites of bleeding, as a bridge to more definitive damage control surgical techniques.

Finally, a new evolving concept is the EvndoVascular hybrid Trauma Management (EVTM) that takes into considerations early vascular arterial access, REBOA, embolization and stent-grafts for bleeding control with hybrid (Open and endovascular) procedures. This concept takes into consideration all the above in the initial treatment of trauma patients and can finally suggest to take into account the presence of a vascular surgeon in the team managing selected politraumatized patients.

Some complications could occur if the binder is not removed rapidly and if it's over-tightened: PB should not be kept for more than 24–48 h. Skin necrosis and pressure ulcerations could be increased by PB continuous application of a pressure above 9.3 kPa for more than 2–3 h. As the long-term effects of pelvic binder remain unclear at present, including the potential risk of soft tissue complications from prolonged compression, the general recommendation is to remove pelvic binders as soon as physiologically justifiable, and to consider replacing binders by external pelvic fixation.

In elderly patients, even a minor trauma could cause major pelvic fractures or bleedings due to the bones fragility and the decrease in function of regulation systems as the vasospasm. Lateral compression fracture pattern is more frequent, and fractures are usually not displaced. For this reason angiography seems to have more hemostatic effect than PB.

Even in pregnant women, the pelvis can be closed with internal rotation of the legs and PB positioning.

Role of REBOA in hemodynamic unstable pelvic ring injuries

- Resuscitative thoracotomy with aortic cross-clamping represents an acute measure of temporary bleeding control for unresponsive patients "in extremis" with exsanguinating traumatic hemorrhage. [Grade 1A]
- REBOA technique may provide a valid innovative alternative to aortic cross-clamping [Grade 2B].
- In hemodynamic unstable patients with suspected pelvic bleeding (systolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg or non-responders to direct blood products transfusion), REBOA in zone III should be considered as a bridge to definitive treatment [Grade 2B].
- In major trauma patients with suspected pelvic trauma, arterial vascular access via femoral artery (e.g. 5Fr) introducer might be considered as the first step for eventually REBOA placement [Grade 2C].
- Partial-REBOA or/and intermittent-REBOA should be considered to decrease occlusion time and ischemic insult [Grade 2C].

Methods

This was a retrospective case-cohort study approved by the Institutional Review Board of Chang Gung Memorial Hospital. From January 2016 to December 2017, 8111 trauma patients were registered in the Chang Gung Memorial Hospital trauma registry. Four hundred and twenty-five out of these 8111 patients had a pelvic fracture. The aim of the current study was to investigate the correlation of vascular injury and fracture pattern with the clinical outcome of trauma patients whose principle injury was pelvic fracture. Therefore, all patients with a diagnosis of pelvic fracture were included in the study if they were older than 18 years old and did not have an abbreviated injury scale (AIS) score higher than 2 in any body region other than the pelvis. As a result, a total of 155 patients were included in this study. All patients were treated by following a standardized protocol for initial resuscitation and management according to ATLS recommendations and pelvic trauma treatment guidelines.

Their medical records were reviewed carefully, and data were collected regarding patient demographics and clinical profiles, including age, sex, mechanism of injury, hemodynamics upon ER admission, AIS score, ISS, type and grade of pelvic fracture, computed tomography (CT) findings regarding vascular injury and hemorrhage, number of blood transfusions during ER resuscitation and throughout hospitalization, length of ICU stay, total length of hospital stay, and mortality. In general, the algorithm for initial management was similar to the well-recognized guidelines in the literature: hemodynamic instability was defined by a systolic blood pressure less than 90 mmHg upon ER admission; CT was performed for all hemodynamically stable patients and for those hemodynamically unstable patients who could be stabilized after resuscitation; angioembolization was considered for those patients who showed a contrast blush on CT or those who showed no contrast blush on CT but still showed signs of ongoing bleeding.

### Accuracy of the WSES classification system for pelvic ring disruptions: an international validation study [^8d8b4b29]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Pelvic fracture is often a result of high-energy blunt trauma and accounts for approximately 3% of all skeletal injuries. In addition to bony injury, which may result in pain and disability, the associated vascular injury could be life-threatening, with an overall mortality rate of 10–26%. Previously, pelvic fracture was classified using two classification systems, the Young and Burgess classification and the Tile classification, which are based only on anatomical injuries. In 2017, a novel classification and guideline were established by the World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES), which includes surgeons from around the world. This classification considered both physiological status and mechanical stability to enable more effective critical decision making.

In the current study, the effectiveness of the WSES classification for pelvic injuries was validated using nationwide real-world data. Although pelvic ring stability was evaluated by the WSES classification, associated vascular injury was not. It has been reported that the severity of vascular injury is a more significant factor in determining patient outcomes than the fracture pattern in patients with pelvic fracture. Therefore, the role of vascular injury in this system was also analyzed. Finally, a subcohort stratification for patients with open pelvic fracture was performed. We tried to examine whether the outcomes of open and closed pelvic fracture patients with the same WSES injury severity are different.

Bladder

Retrograde cystography (conventional radiography or CT-scan) represents the diagnostic procedure of choice in bladder injuries. (GoR 1C)
Retrograde cystography should be always performed in hemodynamically stable or stabilized patients with suspected bladder injury. (GoR 1C)
Intravenous contrast-enhanced CT-scan with delayed phase is less sensitive and specific than retrograde cystography in detecting bladder injuries. (GoR 1B)
In pelvic bleeding amenable to angioembolization associated with suspected bladder injuries, cystography should be postponed until the completion of the angiographic procedure to avoid affecting the accuracy of angiography. (GoR 2A)
Direct inspection of the intraperitoneal bladder, whenever feasible, should always be performed during emergency laparotomy in patients with suspected bladder injury. Methylene blue or indigo carmine could be useful in intraoperative investigation. (GoR 1C)

In the presence of a pelvic fracture, macro-hematuria is associated with a bladder injury in almost one-third of cases and therefore represents an absolute indication for imaging of the bladder. However, micro-hematuria is not an indication for mandatory radiologic evaluation. Cystography should always be considered if other indicators of bladder injury are present such as low urine output, abdominal distension, inability to void, suprapubic tenderness, uremia or elevated creatinine level and entrance/exit wounds in the lower abdomen, perineum, or buttocks.

Conventional or CT-scan cystography has similar sensitivity and specificity in identifying bladder injuries (for 95% and 100% respectively). Whenever possible CT-scan cystography would be preferred. If associated urethral injury is suspected, a retrograde urethrography should be obtained before bladder catheterization. Passive anterograde distension of the bladder with exclusive renal-excreted contrast by clamping of the urinary catheter during abdominopelvic CT is not an effective maneuver to diagnose bladder rupture due to the high false negative rate caused by the low intravesical urine pressure. A technical pitfall of conventional cystography is represented by the false negative results in case of injuries located in the posterior wall: the lateral view is in fact rarely feasible due to the extent of pelvic injuries. In case a bladder injury is suspected in the presence of a bleeding pelvic fracture possibly amenable to angiographic management, caution should be used as extravasated contrast in the pelvis may impair the accuracy of the angiography.

Pelvic fractures are common in polytrauma and continue to pose a difficult management dilemma for even the most experienced clinicians. Due to the high energy mechanisms involved, there are often multiple other injuries and many specialists may be involved. Deriving an effective management strategy relies on early diagnosis and prioritisation of the most immediately life-threatening injuries. Contrary to ATLS advice, CT can be used to facilitate this even in the haemodynamically unstable patient. This article defines the role of CT in pelvic fractures and provides an overview of fracture classification.

### Management of bleeding following major trauma: a European guideline [^9e6fc05c]. Critical Care (2007). Low credibility.

Introduction

Evidence-based recommendations can be made with respect to many aspects of the acute management of the bleeding trauma patient, which when implemented may lead to improved patient outcomes.

Methods

The multidisciplinary Task Force for Advanced Bleeding Care in Trauma was formed in 2005 with the aim of developing guidelines for the management of bleeding following severe injury. Recommendations were formulated using a nominal group process and the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) hierarchy of evidence and were based on a systematic review of published literature.

Results

Key recommendations include the following: The time elapsed between injury and operation should be minimised for patients in need of urgent surgical bleeding control, and patients presenting with haemorrhagic shock and an identified source of bleeding should undergo immediate surgical bleeding control unless initial resuscitation measures are successful. A damage control surgical approach is essential in the severely injured patient. Pelvic ring disruptions should be closed and stabilised, followed by appropriate angiographic embolisation or surgical bleeding control, including packing. Patients presenting with haemorrhagic shock and an unidentified source of bleeding should undergo immediate further assessment as appropriate using focused sonography, computed tomography, serum lactate, and/or base deficit measurements. This guideline also reviews appropriate physiological targets and suggested use and dosing of blood products, pharmacological agents, and coagulation factor replacement in the bleeding trauma patient.

Conclusion

A multidisciplinary approach to the management of the bleeding trauma patient will help create circumstances in which optimal care can be provided. By their very nature, these guidelines reflect the current state-of-the-art and will need to be updated and revised as important new evidence becomes available.

Management of pelvic fractures with associated hemorrhage — hemodynamically unstable patients should have a pelvic binder or circumferential sheet used to temporarily stabilize their pelvis, early activation of a massive transfusion protocol should be strongly considered, and when angiography is unavailable, preperitoneal packing and/or external fixation of the pelvis should be performed with early transfer to a designated trauma center recommended if this step is not possible; selective embolization is preferred over nonselective embolization, when possible, due to a lower risk of complications. Patients with pelvic fractures are at high risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). Early initiation of pharmacologic DVT prophylaxis is recommended.

### Surgical stabilization of rib fractures (SSRF): the WSES and CWIS position paper [^4554a7cd]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Project rationale and design

This position paper is supported by the World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) and the Chest Wall Injury Society (CWIS) and aims to provide a systematic review of the literature investigating the surgical management of rib fractures in the emergency setting, to develop position statements based on the currently best available evidence and practice. For this purpose, the organizing committee constituted a steering committee, that had the task of drafting the present position paper, and an international expert panel composed of experts who were asked to revise the manuscript and position statements critically. The position paper was developed according to the WSES methodology. We shall present the systematic review of the literature and provide the derived statements upon which a consensus was reached, specifying the quality of the supporting evidence and suggesting future research directions.

Purpose and use of these guidelines

These guidelines are evidence-based, with the grades of recommendation based on the evidence. They do not represent the standard of practice, but are suggested plans of care, based on best available evidence and a consensus of experts. They do not exclude other approaches as being within a standard of practice. The treating clinician should determine the most appropriate action, after taking into account conditions at the relevant medical institution (staff levels, experience, equipment, etc.) and the characteristics of the individual patient. The responsibility for the management and outcome rests with the engaging practitioners, and not the consensus group. Furthermore, we recognize that the SSRF literature is continually evolving, and these guidelines represent the state of the art at the current time, subject to modifications as new research becomes available.

### The European guideline on management of major bleeding and coagulopathy following trauma: fifth edition [^cf5a834e]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

If the patient is haemodynamically unstable and in haemorrhagic shock, the urgent treatment goal is rapid achievement of haemostasis. An initial strategy, performed while DCR is ongoing and before proceeding to arteriography, relies on the insertion of an intra-aortic occlusion balloon and/or extra-peritoneal pelvic packing. If haemodynamic instability persists, a laparotomy for haemostasis should be performed without delay. In a haemodynamically stable patient, contrast-enhanced systematic CT is required to obtain a comprehensive assessment of the lesions prior to surgery.

The initial therapy for pelvic fractures includes control of venous and/or cancellous bone bleeding by pelvic closure as a first step. Some institutions use primarily external fixators to control haemorrhage from pelvic fractures, but pelvic closure may also be achieved using a pelvic binder, a pelvic C-clamp or improvised methods such as a bed sheet. Based on the available literature, pelvic circumferential compression devices are widely used in the initial management of patients with suspected pelvic bleeding. There is evidence to suggest that external compression reduces disrupted pelvic rings. However, some complications have been reported following the application of pelvic circumferential compression devices. Until this can be clarified, judicious application of pelvic circumferential compression devices will continue to be recommended. In addition to the pelvic closure, fracture stabilisation and the tamponade effect of the haematoma, pre-, extra- or retroperitoneal packing may reduce or control the venous bleeding. Pre-peritoneal packing is used to decrease the need for pelvic embolisation and may be performed simultaneously, or soon after, initial pelvic fracture stabilisation. The most commonly embolised vascular bed and therefore the most studied is the pelvis. Pelvic packing could potentially aid in early intra-pelvic bleeding control and provide crucial time for more selective haemorrhage management.
