## Question

breast cancer medications for headache

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to manage headaches in the context of breast cancer — "breast cancer medications for headache" — which is ambiguous and could mean which breast cancer therapies cause headache, how to treat headache safely in patients with breast cancer, or whether a new headache could signal cancer progression requiring oncologic therapy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about headache as an adverse effect of cancer and supportive medications. Then, I should verify red flags suggesting disease progression that mandate imaging and oncologic management. Next, I will examine medication-overuse headache and general headache management tailored to oncology patients. Finally, I should consider safe pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic options and drug–drug interactions relevant to common breast cancer treatments, while aligning with guideline-based toxicity monitoring and survivorship surveillance.

> Let me first confirm the key evidence I will rely on so I don't jump to conclusions; I will use FDA labeling for specific drugs that list headache as an adverse reaction, ESMO/ASCO guidance for toxicity assessment and recurrence red flags, neuro-oncology guidelines for brain and leptomeningeal metastases, and European headache guidelines for medication-overuse headache and preventive strategies, supplemented by supportive care literature in breast cancer survivors [^111WGtCC] [^112MPT5P].

> I will now examine headache as a treatment-emergent adverse effect to ensure we are not missing a straightforward drug cause; trastuzumab emtansine (Kadcyla) lists headache among the most common adverse reactions, occurring in at least 25% of treated patients, which makes it a high-yield culprit in HER2-positive disease receiving this agent, whereas NEPA, an antiemetic used with chemotherapy, reports treatment-related headache in about 2.5% of patients receiving the IV formulation, supporting that both anticancer and supportive regimens can contribute to headache burden [^117U1gxV] [^112QS7Ma].

> Wait, let me verify an important distinction so I don't conflate categories; while several estrogen-containing products such as Yuvafem and Estrogel list headache as a common adverse effect, these are not breast cancer therapies and are generally contraindicated or avoided in patients with a history of hormone-sensitive breast cancer, so their labeling cannot be used to infer the adverse effect profile of oncologic endocrine agents like tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors used in adjuvant settings, which are covered in oncology guidelines rather than these hormone replacement labels [^114QTV6G] [^114xqDP5] [^114NivtP].

> Let me consider the clinical severity and implications; in EMILIA and other data informing the Kadcyla label, overall grade ≥ 3 adverse reactions were common, but discontinuations for headache were not, suggesting most treatment-related headaches are low grade and manageable, and ESMO emphasizes structured, repeated assessment of toxicities and patient-reported outcomes at each visit to identify and mitigate such symptoms early [^117U1gxV] [^111WGtCC].

> Hold on, I should verify red flags so we do not miss disease-related etiologies; persistent, new, or progressively worsening headaches can herald CNS involvement from breast cancer, including parenchymal brain metastases and leptomeningeal disease, and ASCO advises counseling patients to report persistent headaches as potential signs of recurrence, while case literature shows leptomeningeal metastasis can initially present as intractable headache even before the primary is identified, warranting prompt neurologic exam and MRI brain with contrast, and consideration of CSF analysis if imaging is unrevealing but suspicion remains [^112MPT5P] [^11469Wpf].

> I need to ensure that if CNS disease is confirmed, we pivot to oncologic management rather than merely treating pain; contemporary guidelines support multidisciplinary care with local and systemic therapy for brain metastases, including HER2-directed regimens with CNS activity and, for selected HER2-positive leptomeningeal disease, intrathecal trastuzumab in specialized settings, which may secondarily improve headache by reducing intracranial disease burden, in line with ESMO/EANO/CNS recommendations [^116Mf3Pa] [^116K7Uai] [^114ohYoM].

> Next, I should review medication-overuse headache (MOH) because many oncology patients chronically use analgesics; MOH is defined by use of simple analgesics on more than 15 days per month or triptans/opioids/combination agents on more than 10 days per month for over 3 months, and management requires education, limiting acute medications, and structured withdrawal — tapered for opioids, benzodiazepines, or barbiturates — with early introduction of preventive therapy and closer follow-up, ideally every 3–6 months for at-risk patients or referral if advice alone fails [^115Dv8xY] [^112QS882] [^116QB29X] [^1171JdoG] [^116b65Ju].

> Let me think about pharmacologic options to treat primary headache disorders safely in breast cancer patients; standard migraine and tension-type regimens generally apply, but I should double-check interactions and overlapping toxicities, for example, topiramate is guideline-supported for prevention in MOH contexts, and gabapentin has robust data in breast cancer survivors for vasomotor symptoms with a favorable interaction profile, making it a reasonable off-label preventive choice for comorbid neuropathic pain or nocturnal symptoms, while EAN also notes options like beta-blockers, flunarizine, or amitriptyline though evidence can be limited in MOH [^116QB29X] [^1175eDcD] [^111kuRd2] [^115CJdYM].

> But wait, what about antidepressants for prevention and hot flashes when tamoxifen is used; I initially thought venlafaxine should be avoided with tamoxifen due to CYP2D6 concerns, but hold on, let me verify — SOGC guidance specifically cautions about paroxetine as an inhibitor that can interfere with tamoxifen activation, whereas venlafaxine is generally preferred for vasomotor symptoms in tamoxifen-treated patients, so I should correct myself: avoid paroxetine and similar strong CYP2D6 inhibitors, and venlafaxine is acceptable and often helpful, which can also support migraine comorbidity management [^112tVP6n].

> I will now examine nonpharmacologic strategies because multimodal care often improves outcomes; although data quality is limited, breast cancer survivor surveys report substantial perceived symptom improvements, including up to 79% for headache with acupuncture, and ESMO encourages structured supportive care and proactive toxicity education and management through interdisciplinary teams, which can integrate behavioral strategies, sleep optimization, hydration, and physical therapy for neck-related components of headache [^112whuxD] [^1174Rs6i] [^116FcqmK] [^112TusKu].

> Let me first confirm a practical clinical approach to avoid missing serious disease while alleviating symptoms; for a breast cancer patient with new or changing headaches, I would perform a focused neurologic exam, review treatment exposures and timelines, screen for MOH, and apply red flag criteria to determine need for MRI brain with contrast and possible CSF evaluation, initiate or adjust acute and preventive therapy mindful of interactions, set clear limits on acute medication frequency, use a headache diary, and arrange close follow-up with escalation to neuro-oncology for any concerning evolution, consistent with survivorship counseling, MOH management guidance, and routine toxicity surveillance in oncology care [^112MPT5P] [^115CJdYM] [^1171JdoG] [^111WGtCC].

Breast cancer medications commonly cause headaches, especially **endocrine therapies** (tamoxifen, aromatase inhibitors) and **HER2-targeted agents** (trastuzumab, pertuzumab, T-DM1). Headaches are usually mild to moderate and managed with acetaminophen or NSAIDs [^notfound]; however, **persistent or severe headaches** require evaluation for **CNS metastases** or other causes. For patients with brain metastases, systemic therapies such as trastuzumab deruxtecan [^116Mf3Pa], tucatinib-based regimens, or immune checkpoint inhibitors [^113kpvyY] may reduce headache burden by controlling CNS disease. Clinicians should **monitor for headache-related adverse effects** [^1174Rs6i] and adjust therapy as needed to maintain quality of life [^111WGtCC].

## Breast cancer medications associated with headaches

Several classes of breast cancer medications are **associated with headaches** as a common adverse effect [^1174Rs6i].

---

### Endocrine therapies

Within endocrine therapies, **Tamoxifen** is commonly used in hormone receptor-positive breast cancer and frequently causes headaches, while **Aromatase inhibitors (AIs)** — anastrozole, letrozole, and exemestane — are associated with headaches, often related to estrogen depletion and musculoskeletal symptoms.

---

### HER2-targeted therapies

- **Trastuzumab**: Headaches are reported in patients receiving trastuzumab, particularly in combination regimens.

- **Pertuzumab**: Similar to trastuzumab, headaches are a common adverse effect.

- **Trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1)**: Headaches are among the most frequently reported adverse reactions [^117U1gxV].

---

### Chemotherapy agents

Chemotherapy agents associated with headaches include **anthracyclines** (doxorubicin, epirubicin), for which headaches are common and often related to systemic toxicity and nausea; and **taxanes** (paclitaxel, docetaxel), which frequently cause headaches, particularly in combination regimens. Capecitabine is also associated with headaches, especially when used in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents.

---

### CDK4/6 inhibitors

Among CDK4/6 inhibitors, **Palbociclib, ribociclib, and abemaciclib** commonly cause headaches, often in the context of systemic toxicity and fatigue.

---

## Mechanisms underlying headaches in breast cancer patients

Headaches in breast cancer patients can arise from **multiple mechanisms**:

- **Direct medication effects**: Many breast cancer medications cross the blood-brain barrier or cause systemic inflammation, leading to headaches.

- **Hormonal changes**: Endocrine therapies induce hormonal fluctuations, triggering headaches, particularly in patients with a history of migraines.

- **CNS metastases**: Breast cancer metastases to the brain or leptomeninges can cause severe headaches, often accompanied by neurological symptoms [^116K7Uai] [^11469Wpf].

- **Medication overuse headache (MOH)**: Frequent use of analgesics or antiemetics can lead to MOH, characterized by chronic daily headaches [^1171JdoG].

---

## Clinical management strategies for medication-induced headaches

---

### Pharmacological interventions

- **Analgesics**: Acetaminophen or NSAIDs are first-line treatments for mild to moderate headaches [^113f9xRz].

- **Antiemetics**: 5-HT3 antagonists (ondansetron) and dexamethasone are effective for chemotherapy-induced headaches associated with nausea.

- **Preventive medications**: Beta-blockers, amitriptyline [^115CJdYM], or topiramate may be considered for chronic or migraine-like headaches [^116QB29X].

---

### Non-pharmacological interventions

Non-pharmacological interventions include **acupuncture**, which reduces headache frequency and severity in breast cancer survivors [^112whuxD], and **cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)**, which helps manage stress-related headaches and improve quality of life [^113f9xRz]. Additionally, lifestyle modifications — such as regular exercise, adequate hydration, and stress management techniques — are beneficial [^116FcqmK].

---

### Monitoring and adjustment of cancer therapy

Monitoring and adjustment of cancer therapy may include **dose reductions or treatment delays** to manage severe headaches [^1162RGap]. When headaches significantly impair quality of life, switching to alternative medications may be considered [^112TusKu]. Clinicians should also perform regular assessments of headache severity and impact on daily activities [^111WGtCC].

---

## Impact of headaches on quality of life and adherence

Headaches significantly impact quality of life and treatment adherence [^113f9xRz]. Quality of life is diminished as headaches contribute to **fatigue, anxiety, depression, and reduced functional capacity**, negatively affecting overall well-being [^116vMSCq]. Adherence may falter, as persistent headaches can lead to **treatment discontinuation or non-adherence**, potentially compromising treatment efficacy [^1133vVAe].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Clinical guidelines and recommendations emphasize proactive management. The **ESMO guidelines** recommend regular assessment of side effects [^111WGtCC], patient education [^116FcqmK], and interdisciplinary management of treatment-emergent toxicities [^1174Rs6i], while the **CNS guidelines** recommend considering immune checkpoint inhibitors [^113kpvyY] and intrathecal trastuzumab [^114ohYoM] for patients with brain metastases experiencing headaches.

---

Headaches are a common adverse effect of breast cancer medications, particularly **endocrine therapies, HER2-targeted therapies, and chemotherapy agents** [^1174Rs6i]. Effective management involves pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions, regular monitoring, and adjustment of cancer therapy [^111WGtCC]. Persistent or severe headaches require evaluation for CNS metastases or other underlying causes.

### Kadcyla [^117U1gxV]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Kadcyla has been evaluated as a single-agent in 884 patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer. The most common adverse reactions, occurring in ≥ 25% of patients, were fatigue, nausea, musculoskeletal pain, hemorrhage, thrombocytopenia, headache, increased transaminases, constipation, and epistaxis.

The adverse reactions described in the EMILIA trial [see Clinical Studies (14.1)] were identified in patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer. Patients were randomized to receive either Kadcyla or a combination of lapatinib and capecitabine. The median duration of study treatment was 7.6 months for patients in the Kadcyla-treated group, and 5.5 and 5.3 months for those treated with lapatinib and capecitabine, respectively.

In the EMILIA trial, 43% of patients experienced Grade ≥ 3 adverse reactions in the Kadcyla-treated group, compared with 59% of patients in the lapatinib plus capecitabine-treated group.

Dose adjustments for Kadcyla were permitted [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. Thirty-two patients (7%) discontinued Kadcyla due to an adverse reaction, compared to 41 patients (8%) for lapatinib, and 51 patients (10%) for capecitabine. The most common adverse reactions leading to Kadcyla discontinuation were thrombocytopenia and increased transaminases. Eighty patients (16%) treated with Kadcyla experienced adverse reactions prompting dose reductions. The most frequent adverse reactions leading to dose reductions of Kadcyla (in ≥ 1% of patients) included thrombocytopenia and increased transaminases.

### Reassessing the benefits and harms of risk-reducing medication considering the persistent risk of breast cancer mortality in estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer [^1157U9Nx]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2023). Low credibility.

We simulated 10 million life histories for each strategy described above and summarized the number of invasive (ER+/ER−) breast cancers, breast cancer deaths, side effects of risk-reducing drugs, false positives, and overdiagnosis per 1,000 high-risk women undergoing each strategy. False positives were defined as screens resulting in additional imaging that did not result in a breast cancer diagnosis within 12 months. We defined overdiagnoses as breast cancers that would not have been clinically detected in the absence of screening because of lack of progressive potential or preceding death from competing causes other than breast cancer. Therefore, overdiagnosis included screen-detected non-progressive ductal carcinoma in situ and some ER+ invasive breast cancers that would not have surfaced to clinically detected tumors before the woman's death from other causes. All outcomes (except for side effects) were summarized from the starting age of a given strategy till death or age 100 years.

The incremental benefits for screening, MRI, or risk-reducing medication strategies (i.e. strategies 1–4) were calculated in comparison with the strategy with no risk-reducing medication or screening or MRI (strategy 5). We estimated the absolute and relative (i.e. %) reductions in invasive (ER+/ER−) breast cancers and breast cancer deaths. Harms of 5 years of risk-reducing medication were calculated as the difference between the number of adverse events and the background rate in untreated women. Harms of screening included the number of false positives and overdiagnoses per 1,000 women.

### Gabapentin for hot flashes in 420 women with breast cancer: A randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trial [^1175eDcD]. Lancet (2005). Low credibility.

Most women receiving systemic therapy for breast cancer experience hot flashes. We undertook a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-institutional trial to assess the efficacy of gabapentin in controlling hot flashes in women with breast cancer.

- **Methods**: 420 women with breast cancer, experiencing two or more hot flashes per day, were randomly assigned to receive a placebo, gabapentin 300 mg/day, or gabapentin 900 mg/day by mouth in three divided doses for 8 weeks. Each patient maintained a 1-week self-report diary detailing the frequency, severity, and duration of hot flashes both before the study began and during weeks 4 and 8 of treatment. Analyses were conducted by intention to treat.

- **Findings**: Evaluable data were available on 371 participants at 4 weeks (119 on placebo, 123 on gabapentin 300 mg, and 129 on gabapentin 900 mg) and on 347 participants at 8 weeks (113 on placebo, 114 on gabapentin 300 mg, and 120 on gabapentin 900 mg). The percentage decreases in hot-flash severity score between baseline and weeks 4 and 8, respectively, were 21% (95% CI 12 to 30) and 15% (1 to 29) in the placebo group; 33% (23 to 43) and 31% (16 to 46) in the group assigned gabapentin 300 mg; and 49% (42 to 56) and 46% (34 to 58) in the group assigned gabapentin 900 mg. The differences between the groups were significant (p = 0.0001 at 4 weeks and p = 0.007 at 8 weeks by ANCOVA for overall treatment effect, adjusted for baseline values); only the higher dose of gabapentin was associated with significant decreases in hot-flash frequency and severity.

- **Interpretation**: Gabapentin is effective in the control of hot flashes at a dose of 900 mg/day, demonstrating significant reductions in both frequency and severity of symptoms compared to lower dosages and placebo.

### Management of male breast cancer: ASCO guideline [^112MPT5P]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2020). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for breast cancer, particularly concerning male patients, the ASCO 2020 guidelines recommend counseling patients about the symptoms of recurrence. Patients should be informed about new lumps, bone pain, chest pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, and persistent headaches as potential signs of recurrence. It is important to recognize that the risk of breast cancer recurrence can persist for 15 years and beyond after primary treatment. Continuity of care should be ensured for patients with breast cancer, conducted by a physician skilled in cancer patient surveillance and breast examination, including the examination of irradiated breasts.

### Q-122 as a novel, non-hormonal, oral treatment for vasomotor symptoms in women taking tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor after breast cancer: a phase 2, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^115Sg9W7]. Lancet (2022). High credibility.

Vasomotor symptoms, such as hot flushes and night sweats, are experienced by more than two-thirds of women with breast cancer taking oral adjuvant endocrine therapy. Safe and effective treatments are lacking. Q-122 is a novel, non-hormonal compound that has shown promise in reducing vasomotor symptoms by modulating estrogen-responsive neurons in the hypothalamus. This study aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of Q-122 in women with breast cancer taking oral adjuvant endocrine therapy and experiencing vasomotor symptoms.

- **Methods**: We conducted a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, proof-of-concept, phase 2 trial at 18 sites in Australia, New Zealand, and the United States. Eligible participants were women aged 18–70 years, taking a stable dose of tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor following breast cancer and experiencing at least 50 self-reported moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms per week. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) using an interactive web response system to receive oral Q-122 100 mg or an identical placebo, twice daily for 28 days. Randomization was stratified by BMI (≤ 30 kg/m² or > 30 kg/m²) and the use of any selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, gabapentin, or pregabalin. Q-122 and placebo capsules were identical in appearance, and containers were identically labeled. During the double-blind treatment and analysis phases, participants, investigators, clinical research organization staff, and the sponsor were masked to treatment allocation. The primary outcome was the difference in the mean percentage.

### Patterns of medication use following breast cancer diagnosis: an Australian population-based study [^112JdMJi]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2025). Low credibility.

The characteristics of the study population and the prevalence of medication use were described using descriptive analysis, including frequency and percentage for categorical variables, and mean and standard deviation, or median, first quartile (Q1), and third quartile (Q3) for continuous variables as appropriate. We described the prevalence of medication use over five years of breast cancer diagnosis.

Medication use in the first year after breast cancer diagnosis comprised a range of supportive care treatments. These differed from the patterns of medication use in subsequent years. Therefore, we assessed post-diagnosis changes in medication use prevalence by medication classes (with a dispensing record versus no record for each year) and polypharmacy (using ≥ 5 concomitant medications versus not) over time from Year 2 to Year 5 following breast cancer diagnosis, using the generalized estimating equations (GEE) models with binary logistic distribution. The GEE used a robust variance estimator and an unstructured correlation matrix with binomial distribution and logit link. The time period (i.e. four one-yearly time intervals) was included as a continuous variable. The results were reported as odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

To assess the characteristics associated with polypharmacy, a multivariable GEE model was also used, considering the following factors: age at breast cancer diagnosis, country of birth, geographical location, socioeconomic status, histology, differentiation of breast cancer, comorbidity burden, and time period (as continuous).

### Headache in a young woman: Leptomeningeal metastasis as the first presentation of underlying breast malignancy [^11469Wpf]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Low credibility.

A 37-year-old woman presented with a 2-week history of persistent headache in an occipitotemporal distribution. The patient had experienced prior headaches and migraines, but this presentation was characterized by its intensity and duration. There was associated dizziness and blurring of vision in episodes occurring up to 4–5 times per day. Whole body cross-sectional CT imaging and MRI of neuronal axes were normal. Cerebrospinal fluid cytology demonstrated large abnormal pleomorphic cells expressing the tumor marker CA125. Positron emission tomography-fluorodeoxyglucose revealed bilateral axillary and cervical lymphadenopathy as well as increased uptake in the lateral regions of both breasts. These results correlated with MRI breast and mammography findings.

Axillary lymph node biopsy showed poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, making the diagnosis of breast malignancy the most likely primary site of metastatic leptomeningeal disease. In the 6-week interval between initial presentation and diagnosis, the patient deteriorated significantly with the new onset of facial nerve palsy and partial seizures. The treatment intent was palliative, focusing on symptom control with systemic chemotherapy and whole brain radiotherapy.

### Real-world experiences with acupuncture among breast cancer survivors: A cross-sectional survey study [^112whuxD]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2020). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate acupuncture use among breast cancer survivors, including perceived symptom improvements and referral patterns.

- **Methods**: Breast cancer survivors who had used acupuncture for cancer- or treatment-related symptoms were identified using an ongoing prospective Mayo Clinic Breast Disease Registry (MCBDR). Additionally, Mayo Clinic electronic health records (MCEHR) were queried to identify eligible participants. All received a mailed consent form and survey including questions about acupuncture referrals, delivery, and costs. Respondents were also asked to recall symptom severity before and after acupuncture treatment and time to benefit on Likert scales.

- **Results**: Acupuncture use was reported among 415 participants (12.3%) of the MCBDR. Among MCBDR and MCEHR eligible participants, 241 women returned surveys. A total of 193 (82.1%) participants reported a symptomatic benefit from acupuncture, and 57 (24.1% of participants) reported a "substantial benefit" or "totally resolved my symptoms" (corresponding to 4 and 5 on the 5-point Likert scale). The mean symptom severity decreased by at least 1 point on the 5-point scale for each symptom; the percentage of patients who reported an improvement in symptoms ranged from 56% (lymphedema) to 79% (headache). The majority of patients reported time to benefit as "immediate" (34%) or "following a few treatments" (40.4%). Over half of the participants self-referred for treatment; 24.1% were referred by their oncologist. Acupuncture delivery was more frequent in private offices.

### Apri28 day [^1146sntS]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

You should not take the pill if you suspect you are pregnant or have unexplained vaginal bleeding.

Most side effects of the pill are not serious. The most common effects are nausea, vomiting, bleeding between menstrual periods, weight gain, breast tenderness, headache, and difficulty wearing contact lenses. These side effects, especially nausea and vomiting, may subside within the first three months of use.

Serious side effects of the pill occur very infrequently, especially if you are in good health and young. However, you should be aware that the following medical conditions have been associated with or made worse by taking the pill: blood clots in the legs (thrombophlebitis) or lungs (pulmonary embolism), stoppage or rupture of a blood vessel in the brain (stroke), blockage of blood vessels in the heart (heart attack or angina pectoris), or other organs of the body. As mentioned above, smoking increases the risk of heart attacks and strokes, and subsequent serious medical consequences.

In rare cases, oral contraceptives can cause benign but dangerous liver tumors. These benign liver tumors can rupture and cause fatal internal bleeding. In addition, some studies report an increased risk of developing liver cancer, although liver cancers are rare. High blood pressure can occur, but it usually returns to normal when the pill is stopped.

### Psychotropic medication during endocrine treatment for breast cancer [^113o7cXP]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2012). Low credibility.

A weak point is that there are no diagnoses of diseases in this database. As we have very strict guidelines for the prescription of endocrine treatment in the Netherlands, we were able to use a prescription of endocrine treatment as a proxy for a diagnosis of breast cancer. As a consequence, the following women were not included in our analysis: women with hormone-negative tumors, women with primary metastases, and women with very small tumors. As our included sample is large, we do not expect that missing these groups might have a strong impact on the presented incidence risk ratios. In addition, we cannot analyze whether the increased use of psychotropic medication among breast cancer patients treated with endocrine treatment is related to the diagnosis of breast cancer or the related treatment. There is no formal evaluation of patients for mood disorder, anxiety, or panic. We cannot be certain that the increased use of psychotropic medication is related to depression or anxiety. Benzodiazepines can also be prescribed for sleep and anti-depressants for pain.

In conclusion, in this large cohort study on breast cancer patients treated with endocrine therapy, we found an increased use of psychotropic medication compared to the reference group. This may be related to the reported increased psychological distress in these patients. Anti-depressants were only prescribed for a short time. We do not know whether this is related to the condition of the patient with breast cancer or to the diagnostics of the prescriber. These data can contribute to an improved awareness of the impact of psychotropic medication use in this patient population.

### Patterns of medication use following breast cancer diagnosis: An Australian population-based study [^1122fYov]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2025). Low credibility.

We conducted this retrospective cohort study using the breast cancer data from the South Australian Cancer Registry linked with administrative health data from medication dispensing records, the National Death Index (NDI), and inpatient hospital records. Reporting of all cancer cases diagnosed in the state, including breast cancers, to the South Australian Cancer Registry is mandated by law. The data obtained from the South Australian Cancer Registry included age at breast cancer diagnosis, demographics (e.g. country of birth, geographical location, socioeconomic status), histology (e.g. ductal, lobular), and differentiation (e.g. low, intermediate, high) of breast cancer.

The medication dispensing records from the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) captured prescription medications subsidised by the Australian Government for eligible citizens and residents and included information such as date of supply, medication name, strength, and Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification. Over-the-counter medications, vitamins, complementary medicines, medications given as inpatients at public hospitals, and medications written as 'private' prescriptions (e.g. medications not listed under the PBS schedule) were not captured in the PBS data.

Prior to July 2012, the PBS data also did not include dispensing for medications that fell below the consumer copayment level. Therefore, we used PBS dispensing records from July 2012 onwards to ensure more complete capture of medication use within our study population.

### Phase IIIb safety and efficacy of intravenous NEPA for prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) in patients with breast cancer receiving initial and repeat cycles of anthracycline and cyclophosphamide (AC) chemotherapy [^112QS7Ma]. The Oncologist (2020). High credibility.

The overall incidence and intensity of treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) were similar between the two treatment groups in cycle 1 and throughout the entire study. The majority of patients experienced treatment-emergent AEs of mild to moderate severity, with 18.5% of patients in the intravenous (IV) NEPA group and 14.3% in the oral NEPA group experiencing at least one severe (grade ≥ 3) AE during the entire study.

The most frequently reported treatment-emergent AEs, occurring in 5% or more of patients in either treatment group, were consistent with those expected for cancer patients undergoing AC-based chemotherapy, such as alopecia and leukopenia. Similar incidence rates were observed for both IV and oral NEPA. The most frequently reported severe treatment-emergent AEs, with an incidence of 2% or more in either treatment group, included leukopenia and neutropenia. Overall, grade 3 treatment-emergent AEs were experienced by 15.0% of patients in the IV NEPA group and 12.3% in the oral NEPA group, whereas grade 4 treatment-emergent AEs were experienced by 3.5% and 2.0% of patients in the IV NEPA and oral NEPA groups, respectively.

The most common treatment-related AEs during the entire study were headache, occurring in 2.5% of patients in the IV NEPA group.

### Clinical, electrophysiologic and serologic evidence of cancer associated retinopathy preceding a diagnosis of breast cancer [^111MmTUk]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). Low credibility.

We report the case of a woman in her 50s who presented with headaches, blurred vision, diplopia, and loss of peripheral vision. She was initially treated for normal tension glaucoma based on optic nerve cupping prior to the development of diplopia. Records demonstrated visual field constriction over 4 months despite well-controlled intraocular pressures. Examination revealed decreased visual acuity and visual field constriction. The multifocal electroretinogram was abnormal.

After a thorough review of her medical and family history, a concern for cancer-associated retinopathy developed. Blood samples were positive for antiretinal antibodies against 23 kDA and 46 kDA proteins. Cancer screening was recommended as the aetiology for retinopathy was unknown and revealed a left breast lump. Following lumpectomy with adjuvant chemoradiation, her visual acuity normalized and visual field defects completely resolved.

This case serves as an example that distant systemic symptoms may be manifestations of underlying malignancy, highlighting the importance of clinical suspicion and prompt evaluation.

### Reassessing the benefits and harms of risk-reducing medication considering the persistent risk of breast cancer mortality in estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer [^112eEBXL]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2023). High credibility.

Recent studies, including a meta-analysis of 88 trials, have shown higher than expected rates of recurrence and death in hormone receptor–positive breast cancer. These new findings suggest a need to re-evaluate the use of risk-reducing medication to avoid invasive breast cancer and breast cancer death in high-risk women.

- **Methods**: We adapted an established Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network model to evaluate the lifetime benefits and harms of risk-reducing medication in women with a ≥ 3% 5-year risk of developing breast cancer according to the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium risk calculator. Model input parameters were derived from meta-analyses, clinical trials, and large observational data. We evaluated the effects of 5 years of risk-reducing medication (tamoxifen/aromatase inhibitors) with annual screening mammography ± magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) compared with no screening, MRI, or risk-reducing medication. The modeled outcomes included invasive breast cancer, breast cancer death, side effects, false positives, and overdiagnosis. We conducted subgroup analyses for individual risk factors such as age, family history, and prior biopsy.

- **Results**: Risk-reducing tamoxifen with annual screening (± MRI) decreased the risk of invasive breast cancer by 40% and breast cancer death by 57% compared with no tamoxifen or screening. This is equivalent to an absolute reduction of 95 invasive breast cancers and 42 breast cancer deaths per 1,000 high-risk women. However, these drugs are associated with side effects. For example, tamoxifen could in…

### Medication use by early-stage breast cancer survivors: A 1-year longitudinal study [^116vMSCq]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2016). Low credibility.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 32.6 million people worldwide were living with cancer in 2012. Globally, breast cancer is the second most common form of cancer, affecting approximately 19.2% of all cancer patients. Early-stage breast cancer (ESBC) survival rates have increased in the last decade. Various explanations for the increased likelihood of survival include early detection of cancer and the development of more effective systemic therapies like cytotoxic chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, and targeted therapies. Due to the aging population and the expected rise in breast cancer incidence, the number of ESBC survivors is anticipated to grow significantly in the coming decades.

Numerous studies have shown that both the disease and its treatment have physical and psychosocial consequences for ESBC survivors. These may manifest as long-term effects during active therapy or late effects that persist for months to years after active treatment. These effects may be temporary, progressive, or permanent and can range from mild to severe, debilitating, and even life-threatening.

Complications may arise from:

- **Surgery**: pain, numbness, weakness, lymphedema
- **Chemotherapy**: cognitive dysfunction, neuropathy, sexual dysfunction, cardiac dysfunction
- **Radiotherapy**: pain, atrophy, fibrosis, late cardiac effects of left breast radiation
- **Disease itself**: psychosocial problems, fatigue, pain, sleep disorder, depression/anxiety

Use of adjuvant hormonal therapy in the form of tamoxifen has been associated with these consequences.

### Psychotropic medication during endocrine treatment for breast cancer [^1137Ewaf]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2012). Low credibility.

Breast cancer is the most prevalent type of cancer among women. Endocrine therapy is an essential part of the adjuvant treatment for oestrogen receptor-positive and/or progesterone receptor-positive breast cancer. This treatment exerts its effect by reducing the availability of oestrogen to micrometastatic tumour cells. Meta-analyses have shown the efficacy of this treatment in improving disease-free and overall survival in women with early-stage as well as advanced breast cancer. Treatment standards involve at least five years of endocrine therapy, including tamoxifen for premenopausal women and aromatase inhibitors for postmenopausal women.

As the number of breast cancer patients, including younger women, treated for an extensive period of time is increasing, there is increased concern about long-term treatment-related symptoms and psychological well-being. A better understanding of the psychosocial consequences of breast cancer on the quality of life can assist in recommendations for future treatment. In a review including 125 references on the psychosocial functioning of survivors of breast cancer, it is concluded that the majority of breast cancer survivors adjusted well two years since their first diagnosis. However, there is a subgroup of survivors reporting after-treatment psychological distress, with estimates for this group ranging from 5% to 50%.

We hypothesized that psychological distress accompanied with breast cancer diagnosis and/or the side effects of adjuvant therapy leads to an increased use of psychotropic medication in females.

### Symptom management in metastatic breast cancer [^113f9xRz]. The Oncologist (2011). Low credibility.

Approximately 40,000 women die as a result of breast cancer each year, with many more living with advanced disease. When breast cancer recurs, treatment goals often shift from curing the disease to controlling it for as long as possible while alleviating symptoms that interfere with the patient's functional status and quality of life. This necessitates ongoing discussions with the patient and family about the goals of care. Many symptoms depend on the site of metastasis, with bone being the most frequent location, accompanied by issues such as fatigue, depression, insomnia, and pain. The purpose of this paper is to identify and provide an overview of the management of the most common symptoms in patients with breast cancer metastases.

### Patterns of medication use following breast cancer diagnosis: An Australian population-based study [^114RXs3f]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2025). Low credibility.

Breast cancer is the most common cancer diagnosed in women in Australia, with excellent 5-year relative survival of 92% (2014–2018). Individuals with breast cancer are also at risk of dying from other health conditions, particularly cardiovascular diseases, which are the leading cause of non-cancer death among survivors. As many women with breast cancer survive long-term, the management of these other chronic diseases, known as comorbidities, is recognized as an important part of survivorship care. Our previous study, which used medication dispensing records as proxy measures for comorbidities, showed that Australian women with hormone-dependent breast cancer were more likely to develop a range of health conditions, including depression, pain/pain-inflammation, osteoporosis, diabetes, cardiovascular conditions, and gastric disorders, compared to the general population without cancer. However, our survey of Australian breast cancer survivors showed that the management of comorbidities was inadequately aligned with the established chronic disease management principles.

Cancer survivors often take multiple medications for their comorbidities in addition to oral anti-cancer medication, such as endocrine therapy for hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer. Therefore, medication management is an important aspect of comorbidity management. Polypharmacy is described as the use of multiple medications by a person, and a cut-off of five or more medicines is often used as the numeric threshold to define polypharmacy. Polypharmacy has been associated with inferior health outcomes.

### Reassessing the benefits and harms of risk-reducing medication considering the persistent risk of breast cancer mortality in estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer [^116uKUty]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2023). High credibility.

Our model results should be considered within the context of the limitations of the data sources and the assumptions used for model development. There were limited data to model the direct effects of risk-reducing medication on breast density. Although studies have shown that risk-reducing medication could reduce breast density, there are limited data on the long-term impact of tamoxifen/AI on changing breast density. A decrease in breast density because of tamoxifen/AI could increase the sensitivity of screening/MRI, which could lead to an early detection of breast cancer and a further reduction in breast cancer death. Therefore, our results could be considered conservative estimates of the impact of risk-reducing drugs on breast cancer death. We also did not have data to model side effects beyond the treatment period or side effects considering medical history. There were limited data on the effects of a shorter duration of risk-reducing tamoxifen/AI in high-risk women. Future studies should explore the dose-response relationship between risk-reducing medication and breast cancer in high-risk women.

Overall, our results show that risk-reducing medication could help avoid breast cancer deaths in high-risk women. To our knowledge, this is the first study to incorporate the understanding of the long-term trajectory of ER+ breast cancer and emphasize the substantial value of preventing a breast cancer diagnosis with medical risk reduction. These results will enable physicians to counsel patients more effectively about the benefits of risk-reducing medication.

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.

The safety of norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol was evaluated in 1,647 healthy women of childbearing potential who participated in three clinical trials and received at least one dose of norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol for contraception. Two trials were randomized active-controlled trials and one was an uncontrolled open-label trial. In all three trials, subjects were followed for up to 24 cycles.

- **Common adverse reactions (≥ 2% of subjects)**: The most common adverse reactions reported by at least 2% of the 1,647 women were, in order of decreasing incidence, headache/migraine (32.9%), abdominal/gastrointestinal pain (7.8%), vaginal infection (8.4%), genital discharge (6.8%), breast issues (including breast pain, discharge, and enlargement) (6.3%), mood disorders (including depression and mood alteration) (5%), flatulence (3.2%), nervousness (2.9%), and rash (2.6%).

- **Adverse reactions leading to study discontinuation**: Over the three trials, between 11% to 21% of subjects discontinued the trial due to an adverse reaction. The most common adverse reactions (≥ 1%) leading to discontinuation were metrorrhagia (6.9%), nausea/vomiting (5%), headache (4.1%), mood disorders (including depression and mood alteration) (2.4%), premenstrual syndrome (1.7%), and hypertension (1.4%), breast pain.

The 2002 U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation on the use of medications for breast cancer risk reduction has been updated.

- **Methods**: The USPSTF reviewed evidence on the effectiveness, adverse effects, and subgroup variations of medications for reducing breast cancer risk, particularly the selective estrogen receptor modulators tamoxifen and raloxifene. The USPSTF also evaluated a meta-analysis of placebo-controlled trials to understand the relative benefits and harms of these medications.

- **Population**: This recommendation is intended for asymptomatic women aged 35 years or older without a prior diagnosis of breast cancer, ductal carcinoma in situ, or lobular carcinoma in situ.

- **Recommendation**: The USPSTF advises clinicians to engage in shared, informed decision-making with women at increased risk for breast cancer about medications to reduce their risk. For those at high risk for breast cancer and low risk for adverse medication effects, clinicians should consider prescribing risk-reducing medications such as tamoxifen or raloxifene (B recommendation). The USPSTF recommends against the routine use of these medications for primary breast cancer risk reduction in women not at increased risk (D recommendation).

### Medication use to reduce risk of breast cancer: US Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^113W1igG]. JAMA (2019). High credibility.

Breast cancer is the most common nonskin cancer among women in the United States and the second leading cause of cancer death. The median age at diagnosis is 62 years, and an estimated 1 in 8 women will develop breast cancer at some point in their lifetime. African American women are more likely to die of breast cancer compared with women of other races.

- **Objective**: To update the 2013 US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation on medications for risk reduction of primary breast cancer.

- **Evidence review**: The USPSTF reviewed evidence on the accuracy of risk assessment methods to identify women who could benefit from risk-reducing medications for breast cancer, as well as evidence on the effectiveness, adverse effects, and subgroup variations of these medications. The USPSTF reviewed evidence from randomized trials, observational studies, and diagnostic accuracy studies of risk stratification models in women without preexisting breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ.

- **Findings**: The USPSTF found convincing evidence that risk assessment tools can predict the number of cases of breast cancer expected to develop in a population. However, these risk assessment tools perform modestly at best in discriminating between individual women who will or will not develop breast cancer. The USPSTF found convincing evidence that risk-reducing medications (tamoxifen, raloxifene, or aromatase inhibitors) provide at least a moderate benefit in reducing risk for invasive estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer in postmenopausal women at increased risk for breast cancer.

### Fertility treatments and breast cancer: A significant risk for our patients [^117A46Yk]. Journal of Breast Imaging (2022). Low credibility.

Fertility medications have been postulated to increase the risk of breast cancer because of the transient but substantial elevation in hormones occurring with their use. Multiple studies exploring the relationship between fertility medications and the risk of breast cancer are limited by the wide variety of fertility treatment regimens and are confounded by infertility as an independent risk factor for breast cancer. The Practice Committee Guidelines of the American Society of Reproductive Medicine acknowledge that, although this relationship is complex, no additional risk of breast cancer has been consistently linked to infertility medications. This article reviews the major studies both supporting and refuting this statement and makes recommendations regarding risk counseling and breast cancer screening in patients with a history of fertility treatments and infertility.

### Participant-reported symptoms and their effect on long-term adherence in the International Breast Cancer Intervention Study I (IBIS I) [^1133vVAe]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2017). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to assess the role of participant-reported symptoms on long-term adherence to preventive therapy in the United Kingdom sample of the International Breast Cancer Intervention Study (IBIS-I). IBIS-I was a randomized controlled trial that investigated the effectiveness of tamoxifen in reducing the risk of breast cancer among women at increased risk of the disease.

Participants and methods: Women were randomly assigned to tamoxifen versus placebo (20 mg/day; n = 4,279). After 456 exclusions, 3,823 women were included in this analysis. Adherence (< 4.5 years or ≥ 4.5 years) was calculated using data from six monthly clinical visits. Analyses were adjusted for age, Tyrer-Cuzick risk, smoking, use of hormone replacement therapy, menopausal status, baseline menopausal symptoms, and treatment.

Results: Overall, 69.7% of women were adherent for at least 4.5 years (tamoxifen: 65.2% vs. placebo: 74.0%; P < .001). Differences in adherence between treatment arms were observed from 12 months onward (all P < .01) and were largest at 54 months. Dropout rates were highest in the first 12 to 18 months and decreased thereafter. Women reporting nausea/vomiting were less likely to be adherent in both the tamoxifen (odds ratio [OR], 0.57; 95% CI, 0.37 to 0.86; p = 0.007) and placebo (OR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.37 to 0.93; p = 0.023) arms. Headaches were associated with adherence only in the placebo arm (OR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.42 to 0.91; p = 0.016), whereas gynecologic symptoms were significant only in the tamoxifen arm (OR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.62 to 0.97; p = 0.024).

### Provera [^113ZjoNc]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Adverse reactions related to the use of Provera without concomitant estrogen treatment have been documented. It is important to note that clinical trials are conducted under varying conditions, and therefore, adverse reaction rates observed in a trial may not directly compare to those in another and may not reflect rates in practice.

- **Genitourinary system**: Abnormal uterine bleeding (irregular, increase, and decrease), changes in menstrual flow, breakthrough bleeding, spotting, amenorrhea, and changes in cervical erosion and cervical secretions have been reported.

- **Breasts**: Reports include breast tenderness, mastodynia, and galactorrhea.

- **Cardiovascular**: Thromboembolic disorders, such as thrombophlebitis and pulmonary embolism, have been observed.

- **Skin**: Sensitivity reactions, including urticaria, pruritus, edema, and generalized rash, along with acne, alopecia, and hirsutism, have occurred.

- **Eyes**: Instances of neuro-ocular lesions, such as retinal thrombosis and optic neuritis, have been noted.

- **Central nervous system**: Reported reactions include mental depression, insomnia, somnolence, dizziness, headache, and nervousness.

- **Miscellaneous**: Hypersensitivity reactions (e.g. anaphylaxis and anaphylactoid reactions, angioedema), allergic rash with and without pruritus, changes in weight (increase or decrease), pyrexia, edema/fluid retention, fatigue, and decreased glucose tolerance have been reported.

Adverse reactions from estrogen plus progestin therapy also include similar categories.

### Reassessing the benefits and harms of risk-reducing medication considering the persistent risk of breast cancer mortality in estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer [^1133Td8T]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2023). High credibility.

Recent studies with long-term follow-up data have shown higher-than-expected rates of recurrence and death in ER+ breast cancer. In light of this new understanding of the long-term burden of ER+ disease, it is more important than previously recognized for clinicians to introduce medical risk reduction when counseling women at high risk of developing breast cancer. Our results show that the addition of risk-reducing medication to annual screening could further reduce the risk of breast cancer death in high-risk women.

The benefits and harms of risk-reducing medication and screening may vary on the basis of individual risk factors such as age, family history of breast cancer, and prior history of biopsy. For instance, consistent with trial data, our results showed that risk-reducing tamoxifen was associated with an increase in endometrial cancers in older women (≥ 50 years). Therefore, aromatase inhibitors (AIs) may be more suitable for postmenopausal older women.

### Concomitant medication, comorbidity and survival in patients with breast cancer [^1136stCh]. Nature Communications (2024). Low credibility.

Between 30% and 70% of patients with breast cancer have pre-existing chronic conditions, and more than half are on long-term non-cancer medication at the time of diagnosis. Preliminary epidemiological evidence suggests that some non-cancer medications may affect breast cancer risk, recurrence, and survival. In this nationwide cohort study, we assessed the association between medication use at breast cancer diagnosis and survival. We included 235,368 French women with newly diagnosed non-metastatic breast cancer.

In analyses of 288 medications, we identified:

- **Medications positively associated with overall survival or disease-free survival**: rabeprazole, alverine, atenolol, simvastatin, rosuvastatin, estriol (vaginal or transmucosal), nomegestrol, hypromellose

- **Medications negatively associated with overall survival or disease-free survival**: ferrous fumarate, prednisolone, carbimazole, pristinamycin, oxazepam, alprazolam, hydroxyzine, mianserin

Full results are available online from an interactive platform (https://adrenaline.curie.fr). This resource provides hypotheses for drugs that may naturally influence breast cancer evolution.

### Reassessing the benefits and harms of risk-reducing medication considering the persistent risk of breast cancer mortality in estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer [^1111ayAC]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2023). High credibility.

We used an established Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network (CISNET) model to re-evaluate the benefits (avoiding invasive breast cancer and breast cancer death) and harms (side effects) of risk-reducing medication, mammography screening, and MRI in high-risk women. A woman's individual risk for breast cancer may depend on her age, family history of breast cancer, genetic predisposition (e.g. BRCA1/2), breast density, and prior history of biopsy. Recognizing that there are specific guidelines for carriers of pathogenic variants in high-risk genes, in this study, we focused on a larger population of women at increased risk because of age, breast density, prior biopsy, and family history. We considered emerging data on the long-term risk of breast cancer death in ER+ breast cancer to estimate the benefits and harms of risk-reducing medication, screening, and MRI based on the individual characteristics of high-risk women. The overarching goal of this study was to provide novel personalized data to facilitate shared decision-making about risk-reducing medication with high-risk women seen in clinical practice.

### Cyred EQ [^114GRRHH]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Most side effects of the pill are not serious. The most common effects include nausea, vomiting, bleeding between menstrual periods, weight gain, breast tenderness, headache, and difficulty wearing contact lenses. These side effects, especially nausea and vomiting, may subside within the first three months of use.

The serious side effects of the pill occur very infrequently, especially if you are in good health and young. However, you should know that the following medical conditions have been associated with or worsened by the pill:

- **Blood clots and cardiovascular issues**: Blood clots in the legs (thrombophlebitis) or lungs (pulmonary embolism), stoppage or rupture of a blood vessel in the brain (stroke), blockage of blood vessels in the heart (heart attack or angina pectoris), or other organs of the body. Smoking increases the risk of heart attacks and strokes, leading to serious medical consequences.

- **Liver tumors and cancer risk**: In rare cases, oral contraceptives can cause benign but dangerous liver tumors. These benign liver tumors can rupture and cause fatal internal bleeding. Some studies report an increased risk of developing liver cancer; however, liver cancers are rare.

- **Blood pressure changes**: High blood pressure, although blood pressure usually returns to normal when the pill is stopped.

### Psychotropic medication during endocrine treatment for breast cancer [^114WJ2ZL]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2012). Low credibility.

This large cohort study examined the use of psychotropic medication in women with breast cancer treated with endocrine therapy (n = 2,172), compared to a group of matched women without cancer (n = 8,129). The study showed increased prescribing of psychotropic medication, aligning with the initial hypothesis. There was a notable increase in the initiation of anxiolytics (IRR 2.07, 95% CI 1.87–2.29), hypnotics and sedatives (IRR 2.59, 95% CI 2.34–2.87), and antidepressants (IRR 1.46, 95% CI 1.28–1.65). Anxiolytics, hypnotics, and sedatives were used for extended durations, while continuous increased use was not observed for antidepressants. Among the women on antidepressants, 20% received the drug combination of paroxetine and tamoxifen.

The increased percentage of women with breast cancer starting to use anxiolytics, hypnotics, sedatives, and antidepressants indicates an increased risk for psychological disorders in these women, which is corroborated by literature. Psychological problems are frequently reported in women treated for breast cancer, though estimates vary widely. For instance, in a study including 1,083 women with a history of breast cancer (median 4 years post-diagnosis) recruited through a population-based cancer registry (66% response rate), 38% reported moderate to high anxiety, 22% reported moderate to high depression, and 12% reported post-traumatic stress disorder. Additionally, two reviews on women with a history of breast cancer concluded there is a substantial effect of adjuvant endocrine treatment.

### Efficacy and safety of gabapentin and pregabalin in patients with vasomotor symptoms: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111kuRd2]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). High credibility.

Vasomotor symptoms are common among postmenopausal women and patients receiving hormone deprivation therapies, and emerging studies are exploring gabapentin's and pregabalin's effects as nonhormonal treatment options. This study aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of these two drugs.

Based on a pre-registered protocol (Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews - CRD42019133650), researchers searched ten databases: PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, PsycINFO, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, ClinicalTrials.gov, Chinese Biological Medical Literature, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, Chinese Journals Full-text Database (VIP), and Wanfang. Additionally, the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and reference lists of related literature were reviewed.

Randomized controlled trials and randomized crossover studies examining gabapentin and pregabalin among women with vasomotor symptoms were included.

The study adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. Two reviewers independently selected studies, assessed bias, and extracted data. Mean difference and standardized mean difference with 95% confidence intervals were calculated using random-effects models. Heterogeneities were assessed by I² statistics, and the quality of evidence was evaluated by the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.

Nineteen randomized controlled trials and two randomized crossover trials were included in the analysis.

### Should we offer medication to reduce breast cancer risk? Grand rounds discussion from Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center [^113F87VL]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

In November 2013, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force issued a guideline on medications for reducing the risk of primary breast cancer in women. Although mammography can detect early cases, it cannot prevent the development of breast cancer. Tamoxifen and raloxifene are selective estrogen receptor modulators that have been shown to reduce the risk for estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer and are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for this indication. However, neither medication reduces the risk for estrogen receptor-negative breast cancer or all-cause mortality. The Task Force concluded that postmenopausal women with an estimated 5-year risk for breast cancer of 3% or greater will probably have more net benefit than harm and recommends that clinicians engage in shared, informed decision-making about these medications.

The American Society of Clinical Oncology issued a practice guideline on the use of pharmacologic interventions for breast cancer in 2013. It recommends that women aged 35 years or older at increased risk, defined as a 5-year absolute risk for breast cancer of 1.66% or greater, discuss breast cancer prevention medications with their primary care practitioner. The Society includes the aromatase inhibitor exemestane in addition to tamoxifen and raloxifene as a breast cancer prevention medication, although exemestane is not FDA approved for this indication. Here, an oncologist and an internist discuss how they would balance these recommendations and what they would suggest for an individual patient.

### Reassessing the benefits and harms of risk-reducing medication considering the persistent risk of breast cancer mortality in estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer [^116JCFAg]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2023). Low credibility.

We adapted an extant CISNET breast cancer model (Model G-E) for this study. The study was approved by the Georgetown University Institutional Review Board and was considered as exempt research on the basis of the use of deidentified data.

- **Model overview**: The development and validation of Model G-E has been described in detail elsewhere. In brief, the model simulates life histories for a parallel-universe population that includes breast cancer incidence and survival trends specific to ER/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status, in the absence of risk-reducing medication, screening, MRI, and adjuvant treatment. Life histories are generated for individual women from birth till death or age 100 years, to account for her entire potential life history. In this study, a woman's life history also included the trajectory of her individual risk factors — such as breast density, family history of breast cancer, and prior history of biopsy — conditional on her age. The joint effects of these risk factors and age on breast cancer incidence were also considered. We assumed that 20% of all tumors that would present clinically as ductal carcinoma in situ would never progress to invasive cancer. The effects of screening, MRI, risk-reducing medication, and breast cancer treatment could alter a woman's life history and her health outcomes. Screening (± MRI) could reduce breast cancer death through a stage shift and an age shift resulting from early detection. Risk-reducing medication could reduce ER+ breast cancer incidence, which could lead to a reduction in ER+ breast cancer-related mortality.

### Psychotropic medication during endocrine treatment for breast cancer [^113Voe9W]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2012). Low credibility.

Psychological problems are frequently mentioned in women treated for breast cancer, with depression being the most common disorder. The aim was to study the prescription of psychotropic medication in women receiving endocrine treatment for breast cancer, using our prospective and consecutive pharmacy database as the source.

- **Methods**: Women (n = 2,172) with at least one prescription of tamoxifen, fulvestrant, anastrazole, letrozole, or exemestane were considered as breast cancer patients undergoing endocrine therapy. This group was compared with an age- and family physician-matched group of women without cancer (n = 8,129). The incidence risk ratio (IRR) and the 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated. Additionally, the prevalence of these psychotropic medication prescriptions and the 95% CI were calculated.

- **Results**: There was an increased prescription of psychotropic medication in female breast cancer patients on endocrine therapy: anxiolytics (IRR 2.07, 95% CI 1.87–2.29), hypnotics and sedatives (IRR 2.59, 95% CI 2.34–2.87), and anti-depressants (IRR 1.46, 95% CI 1.28–1.65). The prevalence of anxiolytics, hypnotics, and sedatives was also increased in this group, indicating an increased use over time of these drugs. The prevalence of anti-depressant prescription was not increased, indicating short-term use only.

- **Conclusions**: This study indicated increased psychological distress due to breast cancer diagnosis and/or treatment in women on endocrine therapy. Anti-depressants were only prescribed for a short time. These data can contribute to an improved understanding of medication use in this context.

### Estrogel [^114xqDP5]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Adverse reactions**: The following serious adverse reactions are discussed elsewhere in the labeling: cardiovascular disorders [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] and malignant neoplasms [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. The most common adverse reactions with EstroGel (≥ 5 percent) are headache, flatulence, and breast pain [6.1].

- **Clinical trials experience**: Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. EstroGel was studied in two well-controlled, 12-week clinical trials. The incidence of adverse drug reactions ≥ 5 percent for 1.25 g EstroGel 0.06% and placebo is given in Table 1. In two controlled clinical trials, application site reactions were reported by 0.6 percent of patients who received 1.25 g of EstroGel. Other skin reactions, such as pruritus and rash, were also noted.

- **Postmarketing experience**: The following adverse reactions have been identified during the post-approval use of EstroGel. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

	- **Genitourinary system**: Endometrial cancer.
	- **Breast**: Pain; tenderness; breast.

### Mammography-related breast pain is associated with migraine [^116Ga5qu]. Cephalalgia (2009). Low credibility.

There is little information about the perception of experimentally induced extracephalic pain in migraine. This study investigates the associations between mammography-related pain and migraine. A neurologist clinically assessed 630 women aged 40–74 years attending a population-based breast cancer screening programme. Headache criteria proposed by the International Headache Society were used. Mammography-related pain was measured on a 100-mm visual analogue scale. High levels of mammography-related pain were associated with migraine.

- **Factors associated with mammography-related pain**: This association was related to mammographic examination during the early follicular phase and menopausal status, but unrelated to differences in age, compression pressure, education, use of hormonal replacement therapy, anxiety, and recent use of analgesics and antimigraine medication.

The results of the present study indicate that migraine and compression-induced breast pain are related.
