## Question

Pancytopenia in alcoholic

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about pancytopenia in alcoholics, including etiologies, diagnostic approach, and management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining pancytopenia and its clinical significance. Then, I should verify the major etiologies in alcohol use disorder, including nutritional, marrow-suppressive, hypersplenic, and medication-related causes. Next, I will review the diagnostic workup, including when to pursue bone marrow evaluation. After that, I need to outline management principles, including alcohol cessation, nutrition, and transfusion thresholds. Finally, I will consider special scenarios and synthesize a practical algorithm, making sure I double-check key claims against guidelines and high-quality sources as I go.

> Let me first confirm the definition and why it matters clinically. Pancytopenia is a simultaneous reduction in at least two hematopoietic lineages, typically anemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia, and in alcoholics it signals substantial marrow injury, portal hypertension, and/or severe nutritional deficiency, which correlates with worse outcomes and higher bleeding and infection risk [^051e525e] [^548b1171].

> I will now examine the dominant etiologies, starting with nutritional deficiencies. Wait, let me verify the prevalence and impact of folate and B12 deficiency in alcoholic liver disease. Multiple sources emphasize that malnutrition with poor intake and malabsorption leads to megaloblastic anemia and can precipitate profound pancytopenia, with case-level evidence showing dramatic recoveries after folate and B12 repletion; macrocytosis and hypersegmented neutrophils on smear support this diagnosis [^0282cc73] [^b606e252] [^34ec0ea3].

> Next, I should review direct alcohol-related marrow suppression. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to check whether alcohol suppresses all lineages or is selective. Classic and contemporary data indicate alcohol can directly suppress erythropoiesis and megakaryopoiesis, and may produce sideroblastic changes with impaired iron utilization, contributing to anemia and thrombocytopenia even outside of folate deficiency; this is particularly relevant in ongoing heavy use [^7c1e4c06] [^baa000d2] [^0282cc73].

> I need to ensure I account for hypersplenism and portal hypertension. Thrombocytopenia is common in cirrhosis due to splenic sequestration and reduced thrombopoietin, and the degree of cytopenia often tracks with disease severity; this sequestration effect can compound other marrow injuries, so I should correlate with spleen size and liver function tests when interpreting counts [^548b1171] [^bde9eefb] [^0282cc73].

> But wait, what if medications are contributing. I should double-check for hepatotoxic and myelosuppressive drugs common in this population. Methotrexate is absolutely contraindicated in alcoholism and alcoholic liver disease due to severe and sometimes fatal marrow suppression; zidovudine and other antiretrovirals can cause pancytopenia; and even thioguanine has been reported to cause pancytopenia in a minority of patients, so a careful medication reconciliation is essential [^75984195] [^acb20044] [^c65f4403] [^8c37ba91].

> Let me consider infectious and inflammatory drivers. Sepsis and systemic inflammatory response are common in alcoholic hepatitis and can suppress hematopoiesis, while viral infections such as hepatitis B/C and HIV can cause marrow failure; in transplant recipients, donor-acquired leishmaniasis and other opportunistic infections can present with pancytopenia, so I should maintain a low threshold to evaluate for infection when the presentation is atypical or refractory [^da5c8923] [^ffe73c7c] [^53e447f7].

> I should confirm the diagnostic approach next. Initially, I thought a bone marrow biopsy is always required for new-onset pancytopenia; wait, that overstates the case. In alcoholics with clear nutritional deficiency, recent heavy use, macrocytosis, and expected response to therapy, marrow may be deferred, but if cytopenias are severe, atypical, or fail to improve with abstinence and repletion, I should proceed to marrow aspiration and trephine to exclude aplastic anemia, myelodysplasia, infiltration, or other clonal disorders, ideally with cytogenetics and flow for PNH, per contemporary guidance [^f694b9c9] [^70d65387] [^ed6144f2].

> Next, I should review the peripheral smear and laboratory triage. Macrocytosis with ovalocytes and hypersegmented neutrophils points to B12/folate deficiency; round macrocytes suggest liver disease; a reticulocyte index helps distinguish hypoproliferation from hemolysis; and I should check B12, methylmalonic acid if B12 is borderline, folate, iron studies with ferritin interpreted cautiously in liver disease, and a full liver panel including INR to gauge synthetic function and portal hypertension risk [^34ec0ea3] [^1713d8a2] [^546ce611] [^548b1171].

> Now, I will outline management, starting with alcohol cessation. Abstinence is the cornerstone and improves survival across the alcoholic liver disease spectrum; I need to ensure withdrawal prophylaxis and linkage to addiction treatment, as continued drinking worsens marrow suppression and liver disease progression [^151f6a0d] [^1483e81c].

> I need to ensure aggressive nutritional rehabilitation. For severe alcoholic hepatitis, targets of 35 kcal/kg/day and 1.2–1.5 g/kg/day protein are recommended, with thiamine, B12, folate, and zinc supplementation; deficiency states should be corrected and enteral nutrition pursued if oral intake is inadequate, as this supports hematopoietic recovery [^1483e81c] [^1483e81c].

> For transfusion thresholds, let me reconsider the conventional cutoffs in cirrhosis. Although many centers aim for platelets ≥ 50,000/µL for procedures, platelet function and thrombin generation are often preserved in liver disease, and some data suggest adequate hemostasis at lower counts; thus, decisions should be individualized by bleeding risk, procedure type, and dynamic platelet function rather than a single number, and TPO receptor agonists can be considered for elective procedures when time allows [^30313a26] [^bde9eefb].

> I should confirm when to escalate to marrow-directed therapy. If aplastic anemia is diagnosed or if cytopenias are life-threatening and refractory, standard aplastic anemia protocols apply, including immunosuppression or allogeneic transplantation in eligible patients; early HLA typing and hematology referral are prudent when marrow failure is suspected [^f694b9c9] [^ed6144f2].

> Let me think about special scenarios. In alcoholic hepatitis, leukocytosis and SIRS are common, so pancytopenia is less expected; if pancytopenia emerges in this context, I should reassess for superimposed sepsis, medication toxicity, or alternative diagnoses. Post-liver transplant pancytopenia may reflect immunosuppression, infection, or graft-versus-host disease, and requires tailored evaluation and dose adjustments. And in patients with prior bariatric surgery or malabsorption, copper deficiency can mimic B12 deficiency and cause reversible pancytopenia, so I should check serum copper and ceruloplasmin when the smear shows macrocytosis with dysplastic features or neutropenia [^c9d490a9] [^4a4c0f12] [^e531f42a].

> To synthesize, pancytopenia in alcoholics most often reflects the intersection of nutritional deficiency, direct alcohol marrow toxicity, hypersplenism from portal hypertension, and medication effects, with infection and inflammation as amplifiers. A structured approach prioritizes alcohol cessation, targeted nutrition with B12/folate/iron/zinc, evaluation for hypersplenism and liver disease severity, judicious transfusion and procedural planning, and selective bone marrow testing when the course is atypical or refractory, aligning with contemporary hepatology and hematology guidance [^0282cc73] [^1483e81c] [^f694b9c9] [^30313a26].

---

Pancytopenia in alcoholics is most often due to **direct bone marrow suppression** from alcohol [^7c1e4c06], **folate deficiency** from poor intake and malabsorption [^b606e252], and **hypersplenism** from portal hypertension causing sequestration and destruction of blood cells [^548b1171]. Additional contributors include vitamin B12 deficiency, liver disease, infections, and medication effects [^0282cc73] [^da5c8923]. Management centers on **alcohol cessation**, folate and B12 repletion, and supportive care; prognosis depends on liver disease severity and adherence to abstinence [^151f6a0d] [^1483e81c].

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms

Several **interconnected mechanisms** underlie pancytopenia in chronic alcohol use:

- **Direct bone marrow suppression**: Alcohol directly inhibits hematopoietic stem cells, reducing production of erythrocytes, leukocytes, and platelets [^7c1e4c06].

- **Nutritional deficiencies**: Chronic alcohol use often leads to folate and vitamin B12 deficiencies due to poor dietary intake, malabsorption, and altered metabolism, causing megaloblastic anemia and pancytopenia [^0282cc73] [^b606e252].

- **Hypersplenism**: Portal hypertension from alcoholic liver disease causes splenomegaly, leading to sequestration and destruction of blood cells, particularly platelets and leukocytes [^548b1171].

- **Liver disease**: Alcoholic liver disease impairs synthesis of clotting factors and thrombopoietin, contributing to anemia and thrombocytopenia [^548b1171].

- **Infections and medications**: Alcoholics are prone to infections (e.g. HIV, hepatitis) and may use hepatotoxic or myelosuppressive drugs, further suppressing marrow function [^da5c8923] [^c65f4403].

---

## Clinical presentation

Patients with pancytopenia from alcohol use typically present with:

- **Fatigue and weakness**: From anemia and overall marrow suppression [^051e525e].

- **Increased infection risk**: Due to leukopenia and impaired immune function [^051e525e].

- **Bleeding tendencies**: From thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy [^30313a26].

- **Signs of liver disease**: Jaundice, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, and stigmata of chronic liver disease [^d7d1be58].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

A thorough diagnostic workup is essential to confirm pancytopenia and identify underlying causes:

- **Complete blood count (CBC)**: Confirms pancytopenia and characterizes cell line abnormalities [^notfound].

- **Peripheral smear**: Identifies macrocytosis, megaloblastic changes, or dysplasia [^34ec0ea3].

- **Liver function tests**: Assesses liver injury and synthetic function [^548b1171].

- **Folate and vitamin B12 levels**: Detects deficiencies [^notfound].

- **Bone marrow biopsy**: Indicated if etiology remains unclear or to exclude aplastic anemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, or infiltration [^f694b9c9].

---

## Management strategies

Effective management requires a **multidisciplinary approach**:

- **Alcohol cessation**: The most critical intervention to halt disease progression and allow marrow recovery [^151f6a0d].

- **Nutritional supplementation**: Folate and vitamin B12 repletion to correct deficiencies and support hematopoiesis [^1483e81c].

- **Supportive care**: Transfusions (RBCs, platelets) as needed, infection prophylaxis, and management of liver disease complications [^30313a26].

- **Treat underlying liver disease**: Manage portal hypertension, varices, and encephalopathy as indicated [^151f6a0d].

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis varies with the severity of liver disease, degree of marrow suppression, and patient adherence to **alcohol cessation**. Mild cases with early abstinence and nutritional repletion often recover fully, whereas advanced liver disease with persistent alcohol use carries high mortality and may require liver transplantation [^151f6a0d] [^6b947ede].

---

Pancytopenia in alcoholics arises from **multiple mechanisms**, with alcohol-related marrow suppression, folate deficiency, and hypersplenism as the principal drivers. Management hinges on **abstinence**, nutritional repletion, and supportive care, with outcomes closely linked to liver disease severity and adherence.

### Severe folate-deficiency pancytopenia [^b606e252]. BMJ Case Reports (2010). Medium credibility.

Folate-deficiency anaemia occurs in about 4 per 100 000 people, although severe cases causing moderate pancytopenia are rarer. We present the case of a significant folate deficiency in a 50-year-old alcoholic with a background of mild liver impairment and recurrent nasal and rectal bleeding. Her blood tests showed profound macrocytic anaemia with haemoglobin 2.6 g/dl, leucopoenia with white cell count 3.2 × 10⁹/litre and thrombocytopenia with platelets 17 × 10⁹/litre. Serum folate was 0.8 ng/ml (normal 2.5–13.5 ng/ml) confirming severe deficiency. Despite these life-threatening results, the patient was stable, alert and was keen to avoid admission. Medical management of the anaemia included slow transfusion of red cells and one unit of platelets in view of haemorrhagic symptoms, two injections of vitamin B12 while awaiting assays and oral folic acid. A rapid improvement in the leucopoenia and thrombocytopenia resulted and no additional complications were encountered.

Etiopathogenesis of Anemia in Chronic Liver DiseaseClinicalTrials. gov ID Study Overview Common causes of anemia include acute and chronic blood loss due to upper gastrointestinal bleeding, malnutrition, hemolysis, hypersplenism secondary to portal hypertension, and impaired coagulation. Alcohol causes anemia by its direct bone marrow toxicity, vitamin B12 and folate deficiency due to poor oral intake, and intestinal malabsorption. Treatment related anemia is seen in patients with chronic hepatitis C virus infection receiving ribavirin and interferon. Hepatitis associated aplastic anemia, characterized by pancytopenia and hypocellular bone marrow, is an entity seen concurrently with or within 6 months of infection with hepatotropic viruses such as hepatitis B, hepatitis C and Epstein-Barr virus.

Acute and chronic blood loss from varices, portal hypertensive gastropathy and gastric antral vascular ectasia can give rise to iron-deficiency anemia, in which the picture is one of microcytic hypochromic anemia. Another common hematological abnormality seen in liver cirrhosis is macrocytosis. The causes of macrocytosis in liver cirrhosis are also multi factorial. Vitamin B12 and folate deficiency is also frequently seen in liver cirrhosis, particularly of alcoholic origin, due to malnutrition and increased intestinal permeability, and gut dysbiosis. Patients with cirrhosis patients have a high incidence of sepsis which can trigger decompensation and may result in prolonged hospital stay and increased mortality. Many studies have estimated that about 30%-50% admissions of patients with cirrhosis have sepsis. Of those who don't have sepsis at presentation, about 15% patients admitted to hospital develop sepsis during the hospital stay.

After infection develops, the patient may develop acute kidney injury, shock, encephalopathy or disseminated intravascular coagulation further decreasing the chances of survival. Sepsis and the associated cytokines have a myelosuppressive effect and prevent the erythron from making blood cells. This results in an increase in ferritin as an inflammatory biomarker and alters iron metabolism by affecting the production of hepcidin in the liver. The worsening of anemia in patients with sepsis is well documented, and this is further impacted using drugs like antibiotics which trigger inflammation mediated suppression of the erythron and other hematopoietic precursors like megakaryocytes and leucoblasts.

### Association of liver cirrhosis severity with anemia: does it matter? [^0282cc73]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Anemia is the most common complication of liver cirrhosis and is seen in 75% of cases. The etiology of anemia in liver disease is diverse and often multifactorial. Common causes include acute and chronic blood loss due to upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, malnutrition, hypersplenism secondary to portal hypertension, and impaired coagulation. Alcohol causes anemia by its direct bone marrow toxicity, vitamin B12 and folate deficiency due to poor oral intake, and intestinal malabsorption. Treatment-related anemia is seen in patients with chronic hepatitis C virus infection receiving ribavirin and interferon. Hepatitis-associated aplastic anemia, characterized by pancytopenia and hypocellular bone marrow, is an entity seen concurrently with or within 6 months of infection with hepatotropic viruses such as hepatitis B, hepatitis C and Epstein–Barr virus. Given the diverse and sometimes multifactorial etiology (alcohol and hepatitis B) of cirrhosis, it is difficult to determine the exact cause of anemia in these groups of patients.

The most common type of anemia encountered in liver cirrhosis is normocytic normochromic anemia, attributable to the chronic inflammatory state. Acute and chronic blood loss from varices, portal hypertensive gastropathy and gastric antral vascular ectasia can give rise to iron-deficiency anemia, in which the picture is one of microcytic hypochromic anemia. Another common hematological abnormality seen in liver cirrhosis is macrocytosis. The causes of macrocytosis in liver cirrhosis are also multifactorial. Vitamin B12 and folate deficiency is also frequently seen in liver cirrhosis, particularly of alcoholic origin, due to malnutrition and intestinal malabsorption. However, liver cirrhosis is characteristically associated with round macrocytes, whereas B12 and folate deficiency show oval macrocytes and hyper-segmented neutrophils on peripheral blood smear (PBS), along with megaloblastic erythropoiesis on bone marrow examination.

### The differential diagnosis and bone marrow evaluation of new-onset pancytopenia [^70d65387]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2013). Low credibility.

New-onset pancytopenia can be caused by a wide variety of etiologies, leading to a diagnostic dilemma. These etiologies range from congenital bone marrow failure to marrow space-occupying lesions, infection, and peripheral destruction, to name a few. Bone marrow examination, in addition to a detailed clinical history, is often required for an accurate diagnosis. The purpose of this review is to provide a brief overview of many of the causes of new-onset pancytopenia in adults and children, with emphasis on bone marrow findings and recommendations of additional testing and clinical evaluation when needed, with the overall aim of aiding the pathologist's role as a consultant to the patient's treating physician.

### Evaluation of macrocytosis [^1713d8a2]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

Macrocytosis, generally defined as a mean corpuscular volume greater than 100 fL, is frequently encountered when a complete blood count is performed. The most common etiologies are alcoholism, vitamin B12 and folate deficiencies, and medications. History and physical examination, vitamin B12 level, reticulocyte count, and a peripheral smear are helpful in delineating the underlying cause of macrocytosis. When the peripheral smear indicates megaloblastic anemia (demonstrated by macro-ovalocytes and hyper-segmented neutrophils), vitamin B12 or folate deficiency is the most likely cause. When the peripheral smear is non-megaloblastic, the reticulocyte count helps differentiate between drug or alcohol toxicity and hemolysis or hemorrhage. Of other possible etiologies, hypothyroidism, liver disease, and primary bone marrow dysplasias (including myelodysplasia and myeloproliferative disorders) are some of the more common causes.

### Methotrexate (Rasuvo) [^b100f7c0]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Hematologic:

Rasuvo can suppress hematopoiesis and cause anemia, aplastic anemia, pancytopenia, leukopenia, neutropenia, and/or thrombocytopenia. In patients with preexisting hematopoietic impairment, Rasuvo should be used with caution, if at all. In controlled clinical trials conducted with another formulation of methotrexate in rheumatoid arthritis (n = 128), leukopenia (WBC < 3000/mm³) was seen in 2 patients, thrombocytopenia (platelets < 100,000/mm³) in 6 patients, and pancytopenia in 2 patients.

Rasuvo should be stopped immediately if there is a significant drop in blood counts. Patients with profound granulocytopenia and fever should be evaluated immediately and usually require parenteral broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy.

Unexpectedly severe (sometimes fatal) bone marrow suppression and aplastic anemia have been reported with concomitant administration of methotrexate (usually in high dosage) along with some nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

Hepatic:

Rasuvo has the potential for acute (elevated transaminases) and chronic (fibrosis and cirrhosis) hepatotoxicity. Chronic toxicity is potentially fatal; it generally has occurred after prolonged use (generally two years or more) and after a total dose of at least 1.5 grams. In studies in psoriatic patients, hepatotoxicity appeared to be a function of total cumulative dose and appeared to be enhanced by alcoholism, obesity, diabetes and advanced age. An accurate incidence rate has not been determined; the rate of progression and reversibility of lesions is not known. Special caution is indicated in the presence of preexisting liver damage or impaired hepatic function.

In psoriasis, liver function tests, including serum albumin, should be performed periodically prior to dosing but are often normal in the face of developing fibrosis or cirrhosis. These lesions may be detectable only by biopsy. The usual recommendation is to obtain a liver biopsy at 1) pretherapy or shortly after initiation of therapy (2 to 4 months), 2) a total cumulative dose of 1.5 grams, and 3) after each additional 1.0 to 1.5 grams. Moderate fibrosis or any cirrhosis normally leads to discontinuation of the drug; mild fibrosis normally suggests a repeat biopsy in 6 months.

Milder histologic findings such as fatty change and low grade portal inflammation are relatively common pretherapy. Although these mild changes are usually not a reason to avoid or discontinue Rasuvo therapy, the drug should be used with caution.

### Guidelines of care for the management of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis: section 4. guidelines of care for the management and treatment of psoriasis with traditional systemic agents [^3e6a3ec7]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2009). Medium credibility.

Methotrexate — hematologic toxicity risk factors and test dosing in psoriasis are outlined, stating that risk factors include renal insufficiency, advanced age, lack of folate supplementation, methotrexate dosing errors, drug interactions, hypoalbuminemia, and greater than moderate alcohol intake. The test dose is typically 2.5 or 5 mg with a complete blood cell (CBC) count evaluated 5 to 6 days later, and although the use of a test dose does not guarantee that patients will not experience myelosuppression, it is mandatory in patients with a decreased glomerular filtration rate or other significant risk factors for hematologic toxicity. Pancytopenia can rarely occur with the use of low-dose weekly methotrexate, even after single doses, and as pancytopenia may occur as long as 4 to 6 weeks after increasing the methotrexate dosage, more frequent monitoring is suggested with dosage increases. The literature suggests that significant myelosuppression is rare in appropriately monitored patients with psoriasis who have no risk factors for hematologic toxicity.

### Peri-operative identification and management of patients with unhealthy alcohol intake [^b25d2fcb]. Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Thrombocytopaenia may be present secondary to bone marrow suppression, folate deficiency or hypersplenism, possibly reflecting underlying portal hypertension. Leucocytosis may also be present due to hepatitis‐related leukaemoid reaction. As discussed, severity of liver disease may be assessed by the Child‐Turcotte‐Pugh score. Key components of this are serum albumin; serum bilirubin; and prothrombin time. Additionally, elevated (conjugated) bilirubin may suggest active alcoholic steatohepatitis, even in the absence of cirrhosis.

Electrolyte disturbances, particularly hyponatraemia, are common with alcohol excess even in the absence of advanced or cirrhotic liver disease. Hypokalaemia and hypophosphataemia may cause muscle weakness, while hypomagnesaemia may worsen hypokalaemia and may cause seizures. Urea and creatinine can be elevated by pre‐renal causes of acute kidney injury more commonly seen in patients with cirrhosis, while hepatorenal syndrome only occurs in the setting of ascites or significant portal hypertension. Isolated uraemia may be due to active gastrointestinal bleeding.

Biochemical markers for alcohol‐related liver disease have been employed historically to assess liver dysfunction; however, abnormal liver enzymes are poorly predictive of underlying liver disease with only 3.9% of patients with an abnormal value in this domain shown to develop significant liver disease within 5 years of testing. Liver enzyme values should, therefore, be interpreted in the context of wider clinical findings and other test results.

Harmful alcohol intake increases the risk of cardiovascular disease ranging from hypertension and atrial arrhythmias to more serious problems such as cardiomyopathy. The incidence of stroke (haemorrhagic or ischaemic) is also increased. Diagnosis can be aided by using a 12‐lead ECG, while echocardiography can show structural damage to the heart caused by alcohol misuse such as a dilated left ventricle with decreased mass and wall thickness or systolic dysfunction. Echocardiography should be reserved for those patients with recognised criteria such as those displaying signs and symptoms of cardiac failure. In selected cases, cardiopulmonary exercise testing may be of value to identify systolic dysfunction that is masked by the hyperdynamic circulation of liver impairment.

### A case of persistent anemia and alcohol abuse [^baa000d2]. Nature Clinical Practice: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2007). Medium credibility.

Background

A 56-year-old male with a history of excess alcohol consumption for over 10 years and type 2 diabetes mellitus (diagnosed 14 years previously) presented to the accident and emergency department with severe anemia and a 1-day history of nausea and 'coffee ground' vomiting. He had been admitted to hospital on several occasions in the previous 18 months, primarily because of anemia, and had received 30 units of transfused blood during this period. Previous extensive investigations included six esophagogastroduodenoscopies and a colonoscopy, a barium follow-through study, and a radionucleotide Meckel's scan. The prior working diagnosis was anemia secondary to blood loss.

Investigations

Laboratory investigations (full blood count [including reticulocytes], microscopic blood film examination, hematinics, liver function tests with direct and indirect bilirubin measurement, prothrombin time, and lactate dehydrogenase level), transjugular liver biopsy and bone-marrow biopsy.

Diagnosis

Alcohol-related anemia caused by acute hemolysis, sideroblastic anemia and cirrhosis.

Management

Correction of anemia by blood transfusion (6 units), and prevention of recurrence by strict abstinence from alcohol.

pancytopeniaListen to pronunciationA condition in which there is a lower-than-normal number of red and white blood cells and platelets in the blood. Pancytopenia occurs when there is a problem with the blood-forming stem cells in the bone marrow. Signs and symptoms include fatigue, weakness, dizziness, trouble breathing, fast heartbeat, fever, pale skin, purple or red spots on the skin, rash, easy bruising, and abnormal bleeding. Pancytopenia may be caused by certain autoimmune, bone marrow, or genetic disorders. It may also be caused by infection, poor nutrition, pregnancy, cancer treatment, or exposure to certain toxins, chemicals, or medicines.

### Joint American Academy of Dermatology-National Psoriasis Foundation guidelines of care for the management of psoriasis with systemic nonbiologic therapies [^eb68519d]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2020). High credibility.

Psoriasis systemic therapy — methotrexate hematologic toxicity and monitoring — notes that hematologic toxicity is more likely in patients with renal insufficiency, advanced age, dosing errors, drug interactions, hypoalbuminemia, and greater than moderate alcohol intake; a test dose should be considered in patients with such risk factors, and if there is no evidence of myelosuppression or hepatotoxicity the weekly dose can be increased as needed. Pancytopenia can result after even a single dose and can occur as late as 6 weeks, so close laboratory monitoring is recommended after each dose increase. Regular laboratory monitoring with complete blood count (CBC) and liver function tests should be performed every 3 to 6 months assuming no abnormalities, and periodic renal monitoring should be considered in patients with poor renal function.

### Acute graft versus host disease postliver transplant with mucocutaneous manifestations and pancytopenia: remission with Janus kinase inhibitor [^4a4c0f12]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Case 1

A 55-year-old male with a history of alcoholic liver cirrhosis underwent orthotopic liver transplantation. His post-transplant immunosuppression regimen consisted of prednisone, mycophenolate mofetil, and tacrolimus. Thirty-seven days post-transplant, he was admitted to the hospital with fever, initially attributed to a dental infection. Two days prior to admission, the patient's prednisone dose was reduced to 5 mg daily, and mycophenolate mofetil was discontinued per transplant team protocol.

Empiric intravenous piperacillin-tazobactam and his post-transplant trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole were initiated while awaiting culture (blood, urine, and stool) results, which were subsequently negative. Despite undergoing tooth extraction, 4 days after admission, the patient's fever persisted, prompting further investigation.

On day 6 of admission, the patient developed a sudden onset, nonpruritic, morbilliform eruption involving the trunk and extremities (Fig 1) that involved approximately 25% of the body surface area, predominantly affecting the trunk. Over the next 2 days, it progressed to involve 80% of the body surface area. The palms and soles were spared, but digital pain was reported. Piperacillin/tazobactam and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim were switched to cefepime and metronidazole due to concerns of a cutaneous drug eruption. Concurrently, the patient developed pancytopenia — absent at admission — with absent eosinophilia (white blood cell 1.65 × 10³/μL, hemoglobin 7.2 g/dL, hematocrit 20.5%, platelet 41 × 10³/μL, and eosinophil 2%), while liver function tests were relatively unremarkable except for a slight elevation in aspartate transaminase (alanine transaminase 19 U/L, aspartate transaminase 79U/L).

### Peri-operative identification and management of patients with unhealthy alcohol intake [^35dd4a97]. Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Physical examination

In addition to a standard assessment, at‐risk patients should be examined for stigmata of chronic liver disease. In particular, assessment for ascites or asterixis (as a sign of hepatic encephalopathy) should be undertaken as these represent decompensation of cirrhosis which may require specific management. Hypertension is common with alcohol excess, although patients with cirrhosis may have low blood pressure due to hyperdynamic circulation and reduced systemic vascular resistance. It should be noted that findings in liver disease may range from normal to overt decompensation depending on the severity of the disease. When considering regional techniques, it is prudent to document pre‐existing weakness or neurological abnormalities as this may be relevant in the assessment of post‐procedural complications such as nerve injury.

Investigations

A full blood count is useful since anaemia (defined in the peri‐operative setting as haemoglobin < 130 g.l ‐1) from a variety of causes is common in harmful drinking. Although this does not invariably represent a haematinic issue, macrocytic anaemia with a raised mean corpuscular volume may indicate folate/vitamin B12 deficiency or bone marrow toxicity. Iron deficiency may predominate, with reduced ferritin or transferrin/iron saturation levels; however, it should be remembered that ferritin is often artefactually elevated in patients with raised alcohol consumption. Reciprocally, the absence of microcytosis does not mean the patient will not be iron deficient as peripheral erythrocytes may exist in various stages of development. The red cell distribution width may be helpful in these cases as a diagnostic adjunct.

### Bupropion-induced pancytopenia [^290c83b7]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

Bupropion is not a well established cause of medication-induced pancytopenia. In this report, we discuss a case of agranulocytosis, normocytic anemia and severe thrombocytopenia, with concurrent drug-induced rash within 3 weeks of bupropion initiation. Bone marrow biopsy demonstrated hypocellularity < 10% without dysplastic features or increase in blast cells. Other causes of cytopenias, including infections, nutritional deficiencies, autoimmune disorders, liver/renal disease, thrombotic microangiopathy, primary bone marrow disorders and secondary marrow infiltrative diseases were ruled out. Pancytopenia resolved after 1 week of bupropion discontinuation and supportive care.

### Methotrexate sodium (methotrexate) [^86b79c69]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.3	Risks of Serious Adverse Reactions due to Benzyl Alcohol-Preservative

Formulations with benzyl alcohol can cause severe central nervous toxicity or metabolic acidosis, if used in neonates or low-birth weight infants, intrathecally, or in high-dose regimens. Use only preservative-free Methotrexate for Injection for treatment of neonates or low-birth weight infants and for intrathecal use. Do not use benzyl alcohol-containing formulations for high-dose regimens unless immediate treatment is required, and preservative-free formulations are not available. The preservative benzyl alcohol can cross the placenta; when possible, use the preservative-free formulation when Methotrexate for Injection is needed during pregnancy to treat a neoplastic disease [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

Serious and Fatal Adverse Reactions Including Gasping Syndrome in Neonates and Low-Birth Weight Infants

Serious and fatal adverse reactions including "gasping syndrome" can occur in neonates and low birth weight infants treated with drugs containing benzyl alcohol, including Methotrexate for Injection with preservative. The "gasping syndrome" is characterized by central nervous system (CNS) depression, metabolic acidosis, and gasping respirations.

When prescribing in infants (non-neonate, non-low-birth weight), if a preservative-free formulation of Methotrexate for Injection is not available and use of a benzyl alcohol-containing formulation is necessary, consider the combined daily metabolic load of benzyl alcohol from all sources including Methotrexate for Injection (Methotrexate for Injection contains 9.4 mg of benzyl alcohol/per mL) and other drugs containing benzyl alcohol. The minimum amount of benzyl alcohol at which serious adverse reactions may occur is not known [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].

Neurotoxicity Due to Intrathecal Administration

Serious neurotoxicity can occur following the intrathecal administration of Methotrexate for Injection containing the preservative benzyl alcohol.

Metabolic Acidosis with High-Dose Therapy

Severe metabolic acidosis can occur with Methotrexate for Injection that contains the preservative benzyl alcohol.

5.4	Myelosuppression

Methotrexate suppresses hematopoiesis and can cause severe and life-threatening pancytopenia, anemia, aplastic anemia, leukopenia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

Obtain blood counts at baseline and periodically during treatment. Monitor patients for possible clinical complications of myelosuppression. Provide supportive care and withhold, reduce dose, or discontinue Methotrexate for Injection as needed.

### White cell count and platelet count associate with histological alcoholic hepatitis in jaundiced harmful drinkers [^6b05580e]. BMC Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Discussion

For pragmatic reasons, treatment decisions are often made without liver biopsy in those patients with suspected severe alcoholic hepatitis. These reasons include the availability and safety of transjugular liver biopsy. They also reflect the trials of therapy in severe alcoholic hepatitis. While there have been positive trials of steroids where all patients were biopsied, there have also been positive studies where biopsy was not a requirement. This leaves the hepatology community in two camps regarding the importance of biopsy, and this is reflected in practice guidelines where precise indications for liver biopsy are not well established. Recent EASL Guidelines recognise that many centres rely on clinical criteria, and do not consider biopsy as routine practise. However the guidance includes biopsy in the therapeutic algorithm and recommends that it should be considered in high risk patients according to prognostic assessment with Maddrey's for example.

Inflammation, SIRS, and infection in alcoholic hepatitis — AH is by definition an inflammatory condition often accompanied by features of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) including tachycardia, tachypnea, fever, and leukocytosis; infections are common and must be identified and treated, SIRS may develop in the absence of infection, and the presence of SIRS increases the risk of developing multiorgan failure (MOF), which predicts high mortality in AH.

### Chlorpromazine hydrochloride [^efd2ebf0]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

Note: Some adverse effects of chlorpromazine may be more likely to occur, or occur with greater intensity, in patients with special medical problems, e.g., patients with mitral insufficiency or pheochromocytoma have experienced severe hypotension following recommended doses.

Drowsiness: Usually mild to moderate, may occur, particularly during the first or second week, after which it generally disappears. If troublesome, dosage may be lowered.

Jaundice: Overall incidence has been low, regardless of indication or dosage. Most investigators conclude it is a sensitivity reaction. Most cases occur between the second and fourth weeks of therapy. The clinical picture resembles infectious hepatitis, with laboratory features of obstructive jaundice, rather than those of parenchymal damage. It is usually promptly reversible on withdrawal of the medication; however, chronic jaundice has been reported.

There is no conclusive evidence that preexisting liver disease makes patients more susceptible to jaundice. Alcoholics with cirrhosis have been successfully treated with chlorpromazine without complications. Nevertheless, the medication should be used cautiously in patients with liver disease. Patients who have experienced jaundice with a phenothiazine should not, if possible, be reexposed to chlorpromazine or other phenothiazines.

If fever with grippe-like symptoms occurs, appropriate liver studies should be conducted. If tests indicate an abnormality, stop treatment.

Liver function tests in jaundice induced by the drug may mimic extrahepatic obstruction; withhold exploratory laparotomy until extrahepatic obstruction is confirmed.

Hematological Disorders: including agranulocytosis, eosinophilia, leukopenia, hemolytic anemia, aplastic anemia, thrombocytopenic purpura and pancytopenia have been reported.

Agranulocytosis – Warn patients to report the sudden appearance of sore throat or other signs of infection. If white blood cell and differential counts indicate cellular depression, stop treatment and start antibiotic and other suitable therapy.

Most cases have occurred between the fourth and tenth weeks of therapy; patients should be watched closely during that period.

Moderate suppression of white blood cells is not an indication for stopping treatment unless accompanied by the symptoms described above.

### A novel variant in the ABCA1 gene for tangier disease with diffuse histiocytosis of bone marrow [^32567abb]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2024). Medium credibility.

Tangier disease is an extremely rare autosomal recessive monogenic disorder caused by mutations in the ATP binding cassette transporter A1 gene (ABCA1). It is characterized by severe deficiency or absence of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and apolipoprotein A-1 (ApoA1), with highly variable clinical presentations depending on cholesterol accumulation in macrophages across different tissues. We report a case of a 47-year-old man with very low HDL-C and very high triglyceride levels, initially attributed to the patient's metabolic syndrome, alcohol abuse, and splenomegaly. He had pancytopenia and splenomegaly for over 14 years and developed premature myocardial infarction during his diagnostic workup. Suspecting of Tangier disease, we sequenced the ABCA1 gene, which revealed a homozygous new variant c.164A > G p (His5Arg) in the exon 4. Given the limited number of published cases, there are no reliable data on genotype-phenotype correlations in Tangier disease, highlighting the importance of reporting new variants and associated clinical features.

### Assessing the impact of alcohol consumption on the genetic contribution to mean corpuscular volume [^77a904ae]. Human Molecular Genetics (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Alcohol misuse and abuse is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. In 2016, global statistics suggested that 5.1% (~3 million) of deaths and 5.3% (~133 million) of disability-adjusted life years were caused by the harmful use of alcohol. Early identification of individuals who are misusing alcohol is critical for interventions to stop progression towards alcohol dependence and alcohol-related end-organ damage. Unfortunately, a history from a patient is not always reliable, and laboratory tests vary in their diagnostic accuracy, availability and usage. In clinical practice, therefore, it is usual to use a combination of history (including alcohol intake and symptoms consistent with organ damage), physical examination (to look for features of organ damage) and laboratory markers that support alcohol misuse as the underlying aetiology. The most widely used laboratory tests are (a) liver function tests (in particular, gamma-glutamyl transferase), which indicates liver damage, and (b) the mean corpuscular volume (MCV), a measure of the mean size and volume of erythrocytes, which is a non-specific marker of alcohol misuse.

### A phase II, multicenter, open-label, randomized trial of pegfilgrastim for patients with alcohol-associated hepatitis [^0f32ea1b]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). Medium credibility.

In summary, this unblinded, phase II, randomized clinical trial found no survival benefit at 90 days among patients with AH who received pegfilgrastim+prednisolone as compared with those receiving prednisolone alone. Treatment with pegfilgrastim increased WBC > 30,000/mm³ during the first week in more than one half of treated patients, suggesting a significant biological effect. Pegfilgrastim treatment was not associated with a decrease (or increase) in adverse events commonly associated with AH, such as infections and renal injury. Spleen size during the first month increased by ≥ 1.5 cm in four patients receiving pegfilgrastim and three patients receiving prednisolone; there were no complications or symptoms related to the increased spleen size.

### A 54-year-old man with pancytopenia… [^e531f42a]. JAMA Network (2019). Excellent credibility.

Review of systems was notable for fatigue and negative for fever, night sweats, weight loss, dyspnea, or abnormal bleeding. Examination revealed temperature of 36. 7°C; heart rate, 91/min; blood pressure, 120/70 mm Hg; and body mass index, 20.

1. He was well-appearing with conjunctival pallor but no petechiae, no hepatosplenomegaly, and a normal neurologic examination. Laboratory evaluation showed a white blood cell count of 1. 7 × 10³/μL with an absolute neutrophil count of
0. 17 × 10³/μL; hemoglobin level, 7 g/dL with mean corpuscular volume of 103 fL; and platelet count, 116 × 10³/μL. Workup for nutritional deficiency should be performed before serologic and endoscopic evaluation for celiac disease. In this patient, iron and zinc levels were normal; however, serum copper level was less than 5 µg/dL.

In asymptomatic cases of pancytopenia due to copper deficiency, a trial of copper repletion should precede treatment with blood transfusions or erythropoiesis-stimulating agent. This is particularly important in patients predisposed to micronutrient malabsorption. After RYGB, patients generally undergo scheduled monitoring of micronutrients such as copper. If a copper deficiency develops, then supplementation is typically initiated with oral or intravenous elemental copper. 4 Although neurologic deficits frequently do not respond to copper supplementation, hematologic changes are generally fully reversible.
2. Patient Outcome Supplementation was initiated with oral copper gluconate. Within 2 months, serum copper level normalized and blood counts improved.

The copper gluconate dosage was subsequently reduced and maintained at 2 mg daily without recurrence of cytopenias.

### Trends in the management and burden of alcoholic liver disease [^1efe69b9]. Journal of Hepatology (2015). Low credibility.

Management of alcoholic hepatitis

Providing more efficacious therapies for patients with AH is one of the most urgent needs in clinical hepatology. The current first line therapy (i.e. prednisolone) was proposed in 1971, but novel targeted therapies are needed. Currently, there are no reliable non-invasive diagnostic tools for AH in patients with decompensated ALD. The classical profile of AH comprises elevated serum AST up to twice the upper limit of the normal range, although rarely above 300 IU/ml, with an AST/ALT ratio typically greater than 2. Biological parameters indicating impaired liver function include hypoalbuminemia, elevated bilirubin, high INR and prothrombin time. The presence of acute kidney injury, often due to superimposed hepatorenal syndrome, is associated with a high risk of death. In addition, patients with AH frequently disclose leukocytosis and elevated temperature resulting from a systemic inflammatory response syndrome.

In routine practice as in many published clinical trials, the diagnosis of AH relies on clinical and biological criteria. However, such strategy carries a 10–50% risk of misclassifying patients with or without ASH. In the setting of clinical trials, the diagnosis of AH through liver biopsy has been recommended by EASL guidelines, and liver biopsy may be considered in patients with aggressive forms of ALD requiring specific interventions or when the diagnosis remains in doubt. A transjugular route is often preferred due to frequent coexisting ascites and/or coagulopathy. Recently, a histological scoring system has been proposed for predicting short-term survival in patients with AH. The resulting Alcoholic Hepatitis Histological Score comprises four parameters that are independently associated with patients' survival: fibrosis stage, PMN infiltration, type of bilirubinostasis and the presence of megamitochondria (Fig. 3). By combining these parameters in a semi-quantitative manner, this histological score is able to stratify patients into low, intermediate, or high risk for death within 90 days.

### Gelatinous bone marrow transformation due to extensive weight loss in median arcuate ligament syndrome [^458bb3a8]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

Discussion

We described a case of a young man presenting with postprandial pain, weight loss and pancytopenia establishing two rare diagnosis: MALS and GMT. MALS has been recognised as the most common cause of single-vessel arterial stenosis. Patients may adapt their eating pattern to avoid postprandial pain and in severe cases this can lead to food avoidance causing malnutrition and severe weight loss. In a retrospective study 40% of the individuals reported weight loss. The exact incidence of MALS is unknown and most studies report incidences of asymptomatic MALS as accidental findings ranging from 3.4% to 7.3%. The prevalence is higher in young women and in individuals with a low BMI. There is a lack of standard diagnostic criteria, but since the severity of truncus celiacus narrowing is influenced by respiration, imaging must always be performed at maximal inspiration and expiration. Alternative diagnosis needs to be excluded before the diagnosis MALS may be established. Furthermore, there is no consensus on management. A systematic review including data from 400 patients reported postoperative relief in 85%. However, data on long-term effect is lacking. Surgical intervention might be considered after assessment through a multidisciplinary expert panel setting.

GMT is a haematological entity associated with numerous aetiologies and is a marker for underlying disease. Therefore, GMT is not a specific disease of the bone marrow and other causes should be ruled out before establishing a diagnosis. Since GMT has been associated with eating disorders such as anorexia nervosa and self-induced starvation, the severe malnutrition was highly likely to be the underlying cause of the pancytopenia. Nevertheless, other causes were ruled out. At first, malignancy was suspected since the CT showed faecal impaction and wall thickening of the colon. Colonoscopy showed no abnormalities and also ruled out Crohn's disease. Other gastrointestinal diseases such as coeliac disease and gastric ulcer were ruled out by gastroscopy. A malignancy, including haematological malignancy, was ruled out by immunophenotyping, normal karyotype of the bone marrow and no abnormalities seen on the CT scan and PET-CT. Infectious diseases were unlikely, since infection parameters were low and viral serology was negative. T-spot for tuberculosis was negative, making tuberculosis unlikely. In addition, PET-CT revealed no sources of infection. The patient had no history of alcohol abuse, and there were no signs of metabolic or autoimmune disorders. In conclusion, the diagnosis GMT due to severe malnutrition in MALS was made.

### Autoimmune pancytopenia as an early complication of liver transplantation: report of one case [^5c014663]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2004). Low credibility.

We describe here an immune pancytopenia occurring soon after liver transplantation. Viral causes and allo- and/or auto-antibodies transferred with the graft have been excluded. The condition was concomitant with symptoms compatible with clinical onset of acute graft-versus-host disease. Both pancytopenia and clinical symptoms resolved rapidly under prednisone and intravenous immunoglobulins. We believe that the immune pancytopenia was due to the passive transfer of donor's lymphocytes within the graft and their persistence in peripheral blood in the recipient.

### Hypersplenism [^4d756f68]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2001). Low credibility.

Cytopenias in liver disease are a common finding. In the past they have mostly been attributed to pooling and/or destruction of blood cells in the enlarged spleen, leading to the term 'hypersplenism'. With recent advances in the understanding of the physiology of blood formation, in particular with the discovery of several haematopoietic growth factors, new insight into the pathophysiology of blood cell derangements in liver disease has been obtained. Recombinant haematopoietic growth factors present new opportunities for support of the haematopoietic system, which is required because of toxic antiviral therapies or surgical interventions in these patients.

### Integrated proteogenomic analysis for inherited bone marrow failure syndrome [^7e6f384c]. Leukemia (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Inherited bone marrow failure syndrome (IBMFS) is a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by cytopenia in at least one hematopoietic cell lineage, which may progress to pancytopenia and be considered as a predisposition to developing hematological malignancy or solid tumor. Its genetic etiology consists of germline variants in > 30 distinct types of disorders, including Shwachman–Diamond syndrome (SDS), Fanconi anemia (FA), dyskeratosis congenita (DC), Diamond–Blackfan anemia (DBA), and recently identified alcohol dehydrogenase 5/aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ADH5/ALDH2) deficiency. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) analysis has greatly enhanced the elucidation of underlying disease mechanisms in IBMFS, consequently improving the clinical management and genetic counseling for patients with IBMFS. However, the causative genes still could not be identified in > 50% of patients with IBMFS, requiring the establishment of another diagnostic tool to complement with genetic analysis.

### Thiothixene [^22e37f97]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

GENERAL PRECAUTIONS

An antiemetic effect was observed in animal studies with thiothixene; since this effect may also occur in man, it is possible that thiothixene may mask signs of over-dosage of toxic drugs and may obscure conditions such as intestinal obstruction and brain tumor.

In consideration of the known capability of thiothixene and certain other psychotropic drugs to precipitate convulsions, extreme caution should be used in patients with a history of convulsive disorders or those in a state of alcohol withdrawal, since it may lower the convulsive threshold. Although thiothixene potentiates the actions of the barbiturates, the dosage of the anticonvulsant therapy should not be reduced when thiothixene is administered concurrently.

Though exhibiting rather weak anticholinergic properties, thiothixene should be used with caution in patients who might be exposed to extreme heat or who are receiving atropine or related drugs. Use with caution in patients with cardiovascular disease.

Caution as well as careful adjustment of the dosages is indicated when thiothixene is used in conjunction with other CNS depressants.

Also, careful observation should be made for pigmentary retinopathy and lenticular pigmentation (fine lenticular pigmentation has been noted in a small number of patients treated with thiothixene for prolonged periods). Blood dyscrasias (agranulocytosis, pancytopenia, thrombocytopenic purpura), and liver damage (jaundice, biliary stasis), have been reported with related drugs.

Adverse Events

In 50 (44%) patients, a total of 99 adverse events were reported (Table 2). Several patients reported more than 1 adverse event. All adverse events were graded according to CTCAE and were mild (73%) or moderate (27%) (Table 2). None of the patients developed grade 3, 4, or 5 adverse events (ie, severe but not immediately life-threatening, life-threatening, or death) during thioguanine treatment. Most patients reported gastrointestinal complaints (n = 16 of 114 [14%]) and/or developed elevated liver enzymes (n = 26 of 114 [23%]), the latter was considered clinically relevant in 9 (8%) patients. One patient developed pancreatitis during treatment with thioguanine, and both alcohol and gallstones were ruled out as potential causative factors. The treating physician stated in his notes that the observed pancreatitis was possibly caused by thioguanine, although other causes such as autoimmune pancreatitis were not ruled out. Therapy with thioguanine was continued in this patient without the reoccurrence of a pancreatitis. None of the patients needed to be admitted for an adverse event.

Table 2.
Adverse events (n = 99), listed and graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events

Adverse events leading to cessation of thioguanine therapy were reported in 9 (8%) patients and included thrombocytopenia (n = 1, grade 2), leukopenia (n = 1, grade 2), pancytopenia (n = 1, grade 2), elevated liver enzymes (n = 3, grade 1), myalgia (n = 1, grade 2), nausea (n = 1, grade 1), and malaise (n = 1, grade 2).

Infections occurred in 3 (2.6%) patients and consisted of a vaginal infection in a 25-year-old woman, a urinary tract infection in a 53-year-old patient, and a 35-year-old patient experienced cytomegalovirus hepatitis during thioguanine treatment. Treatment with thioguanine was only permanently discontinued in the cytomegalovirus patient. None of the patients required hospitalization as a result of the occurred infections.

### Mucormycosis causing massive lower gastrointestinal bleeding: a case report [^8708cd63]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A 28-year-old man was brought to the Emergency Department (ED) by his father due to acute altered mental status and shortness of breath since earlier that morning. His medical history was significant for poorly controlled Type I Diabetes Mellitus with multiple hospitalizations due to diabetes ketoacidosis (DKA), severe chronic alcohol abuse for 8 years, and chronic pancreatitis. He was also diagnosed with nasopharyngeal carcinoma at age 18, for which he underwent concurrent chemoradiotherapy. According to his father, he had not eaten food since the night prior but consumed large amounts of alcohol. Upon arrival at the ED, the patient was stuporous, tachypneic at 26 breaths per minute, blood pressure 134/109 mmHg, heart rate 85 beats per minute, and afebrile. Initial blood work showed glucose of 420 mg/dL, high levels of alcohol (222.7 mg/dL), metabolic acidosis, elevated ketones (5.4 mmol/L), pancytopenia (WBC: 1.03 × 10³/uL, Hemoglobin: 9.9 g/dL, Platelet count: 32 × 10³/uL) prolonged prothrombin time (19.8 s) and activated partial prothrombin time (> 180 s), hyperammonemia (876 ug/dL), elevated lactate (19.9 mmol/L), elevated liver enzymes (AST 3112 U/L, ALT 328 U/L, Gamma-glutamyl-transferase 1100 U/L), elevated creatinine (2.8 mg/dL) and Blood urea nitrogen (22.0 mg/dL). Initial treatment for his DKA state was given at the ED. However, 3 h later, the patient developed hypotension (BP = 82/42). Norepinephrine was given and the patient was subsequently admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for further workup and treatment.

### Copper deficiency caused by excessive alcohol consumption [^b310b194]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This is the first case report clinically, suggesting that excessive alcohol consumption can be a risk factor for copper deficiency.

Copper is an essential element in the body, absorbed from the jejunum to duodenum, and it spreads throughout the body via the liver. It acts as a coenzyme for many enzymes, and in particular, plays an important role in the bone marrow and nerve system. Therefore, copper deficiency can result in blood cell abnormalities such as various types of anaemia (microcytic, normocytic, macrocytic anemia) and leucopenia, and neurologic symptoms such as neuropathy, myelopathy, and vision loss. In particular, it is important to differentiate this from vitamin B12 deficiency because the phenotypes are similar. Copper supplementation recovers blood cell abnormalities favourably. For neurological symptoms, however, the recovery is partial, and it is thought that neurological symptoms will become irreversible if treatment is delayed. Therefore, it is important to diagnose copper deficiency and start treatment early.

Case report

A 52-year-old woman with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and peripheral vascular disease presented with painful blistering skin of 3 years duration. She was initially diagnosed with porphyria cutanea tarda at her local clinic without investigations, and had no history of hepatitis C, HIV, alcoholism, or estrogen use. Her clinical condition deteriorated to more extensive blistering with subsequent ulceration and scarring involving sun-exposed areas, particularly the face, scalp, dorsal hands, and arms. She noted red urine and developed pancytopenia requiring blood transfusion.

On examination, she had thick, waxy, scar-like changes and dyspigmentation surrounding erosions and ulcerations on sun-exposed skin. Sclerodermoid changes were prominent on the distal aspects of the upper extremities. An intact hemorrhagic bulla was located on the digit (Fig 1, A - C). Biopsy of the bulla revealed a subepidermal blister with pink hyalinized globular deposits arranged in a linear fashion in the epidermis. Biopsy of sclerotic intact skin revealed mild deposition of periodic acid Schiff plus diastase stain-positive hyalinized, lamellated material surrounding superficial blood vessels (Fig 1, D and E). Direct immunofluorescence from bulla and intact skin showed homogenous deposition of IgG, IgA, and fibrinogen along the basement membrane zone and within walls of dermal vessels.

### Everolimus (Zortress) [^50299f6b]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

The population was between 18 and 70 years, more than 50% were 50 years of age (mean age was 54 years in the Zortress group, 55 years in the tacrolimus control group); 74% were male in both Zortress and control groups, respectively, and a majority were Caucasian (86% Zortress group, 80% control group). Demographic characteristics were comparable between treatment groups. The most frequent diseases leading to transplantation were balanced between groups. The most frequent causes of end-stage liver disease (ESLD) were alcoholic cirrhosis, hepatitis C, and hepatocellular carcinoma and were balanced between groups.

Twenty-seven percent (27%) discontinued study drug in the Zortress group compared with 22% for the tacrolimus control group during the first 12 months of study. The most common reason for discontinuation of study medication was due to adverse reactions (19% and 11%, respectively), including proteinuria, recurrent hepatitis C, and pancytopenia in the Zortress group. At 24 months, the rate of discontinuation of study medication in liver transplant patients was greater for the Zortress group (42%) compared to tacrolimus control group (33%).

The overall incidences of serious adverse reactions were 50% (122/245) in the Zortress group and 43% (104/241) in the control group at 12 months and similar at 24 months (56% and 54%, respectively). Infections and infestations were reported as serious adverse reactions with the highest incidence followed by gastrointestinal disorders and hepatobiliary disorders.

### How I treat anemia in older adults [^546ce611]. Blood (2024). Medium credibility.

Patients may also present with deficiencies in B12, folate, and other nutrients such as copper that may cause anemia, macrocytosis, dysplastic features on peripheral smear, and neurologic symptoms. In countries with folate supplementation, deficiencies are rare but should be suspected in those with severe malnourishment including severe alcohol overuse. Adults aged > 60 years are at highest risk for developing pernicious anemia (autoantibodies against intrinsic factor and parietal cells). A B12 level of < 300 pg/mL suggests B12 deficiency but does not necessarily indicate B12-deficient anemia. Elevated levels of serum methylmalonic acid suggest B12 deficiency and warrants a diagnostic trial of B12. Methylmalonic acid assays are not readily available in all laboratories and correction of borderline B12 deficiency does not always lead to hemoglobin improvement. In cases of borderline B12 deficiency (levels 200–300 pg/mL), we recommend a therapeutic trial of B12, considering the low cost and potential benefit of supplementation. Symptoms of B12 deficiency can be reversed with appropriate supplementation. Severe pernicious anemia should be corrected slowly to reduce the risk of sudden death related to shifts in potassium from extracellular fluid into maturing RBCs. Older adults with mild B12 deficiency with normal absorption usually respond to an oral B12 dose of 1000 μg, daily. Patients with impaired absorption often require parenteral B12 indefinitely.

### A 43-year-old woman with abdominal pain and fever [^937acf14]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Abdominal ultrasound showed mild hepatomegaly, mild splenomegaly, mild gallbladder wall thickening and pericholecystic fluid. There were no gallstones or biliary ductal dilatation. Chest radiograph was normal. The patient was admitted for presumed cholecystitis and treated with ceftriaxone and metronidazole.

Marked thrombocytopenia may arise from acute infection or medication toxicity, but autoimmunity, hypersplenism or an infiltrative process of the bone marrow must also be considered. The urinalysis results are compatible with pyelonephritis, but there is no history of dysuria or costovertebral angle tenderness. Other explanations for the urinary findings include glomerulonephritis or urolithiasis. Endocarditis, via immune complex deposition, could cause this active urine sediment and involve the liver.

The laboratory tests point to a combined cholestatic and hepatocellular process. The AST to ALT ratio is compatible with alcoholic hepatitis, which can present with systemic toxicity and abdominal pain; therefore, revisiting the alcohol history would be logical here. Acetaminophen levels should be checked. The sonogram results, particularly the absence of gallstones, substantially lower the likelihood of acute cholecystitis, and the left-sided abdominal pain never really supported that diagnosis. Given the biochemical evidence of direct liver involvement and unexplained left upper quadrant pain, an abdominal CT is indicated.

She has a subacute illness associated with weight loss, night sweats, SIRS, prolonged fever, LUQ pain, hepatopathy and thrombocytopenia. Leading considerations include alcoholic hepatitis, SLE with autoimmune hepatitis, lymphoma or an indolent infection. Her travel to Mexico and potential involvement of the reticuloendothelial system (liver, spleen, bone marrow) renders tuberculosis, fungal infections (e.g. histoplasmosis), endocarditis (especially if she has undiagnosed rheumatic heart disease) and brucellosis distinct possibilities. HIV testing is also indicated.

The clinician has explicitly articulated the revised problem representation in the first sentence of the paragraph above. The new data have triggered new hypotheses (e.g. alcoholic hepatitis) and eliminated earlier hypotheses (e.g. cholecystitis). The next diagnostic test (abdominal CT) is chosen to identify features that discriminate among the competing diagnoses.

### Case report: COVID associated pancytopenia unmasking previously undiagnosed pernicious anemia [^3d60a64f]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2022). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

The COVID associated pancytopenia is a known but rare complication of the COVID-19 syndrome and usually presents in those with underlying risk factors such as diabetes, or prior malignancy. – This was supported by our patient, where he was found to have a previously undiagnosed risk factor, pernicious anemia. Our patient was asymptomatic before his COVID infection and had no known risk factors which would have indicated a B12 deficiency. Although there are reports in literature of patients developing autoimmune disease post COVID infection, it is possible that our patient developed the B12 deficiency in the setting of a COVID response, although unlikely. Although a causal link between autoimmune disease and COVID has not been identified, it is suggested by temporal association.

It is hypothesized that COVID causes myelosuppression by autoantibody targeted destruction of blood cells. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 targets angiotensin converting enzyme 2 receptors, which have been also found in bone marrow. Thus, binding to these receptors can cause downstream effects including pancytopenia. Furthermore, there are case reports that have hypothesized that proinflammatory cytokines can impair hematopoiesis. With infection of SARS-CoV-2 in the lungs, the destruction of lung hematopoietic progenitors can result in pancytopenia.

The COVID pancytopenia is usually self-limited and will resolve with supportive care and addressing any underlying risk factors. – Our case supports this, as seen by his improvement over admission with supportive care, and further return to normal cell line function on follow-up. The COVID pancytopenia, although rare, is still possible and should be on the differential for patients with recent COVID infections presenting with decrease of all three cells lines. Workup for concurrent causes should also be done, however, a bone marrow biopsy may not be necessary in the setting of improving pancytopenia with supportive care. We encourage clinicians to consider this before doing invasive tests.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^548b1171]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Prothrombin time (PT) and INR are assessments of blood clotting, which are used to measure liver function, as the underlying protein clotting factors (II, V, VII, IX and X) are made in the liver. If there is significant liver injury (usually loss of > 70% of synthetic function), this results in a reduction in clotting factor production and subsequent coagulopathy, as confirmed by a prolonged PT or INR. While a prolonged PT/INR can indicate either acute or chronic liver dysfunction it can also be caused by vitamin K deficiency as seen in fat malabsorption and chronic cholestasis.

A reduction in platelets, termed thrombocytopenia, is the most common haematological abnormality found in patients with chronic liver disease and is an indicator of advanced disease. Multiple factors culminate in a low platelet count: decreased production, splenic sequestration and increased destruction. Decreased production is a consequence of bone marrow suppression, as caused by alcohol, iron overload, drugs and viridae, and also by a reduction in thrombopoietin levels in chronic liver injury. Splenic sequestration results from hypersplenism, which is a consequence of portal hypertension seen in advanced liver fibrosis. Platelet destruction is also increased non-specifically in liver cirrhosis owing to shear stress, fibrinolysis and bacterial translocation, whereas in specific causes of autoimmune liver disease, immunologically mediated destruction of platelets occurs owing to antiplatelet immunoglobulin.

### ACG clinical guideline: alcoholic liver disease [^737e4288]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2018). Medium credibility.

Alcoholic hepatitis — proposed definitions and subtypes categorize cases as definite, probable, and possible. Definite alcoholic hepatitis requires histological confirmation of features of alcoholic hepatitis. Probable alcoholic hepatitis is a clinical diagnosis based on (a) heavy alcohol use for > 5 years, (b) active alcohol use until 4 weeks prior to presentation, (c) sudden onset or worsening of jaundice, and (d) AST/ALT ratio > 1.5:1 with levels < 400IU/L, with (e) absence of other causes of liver disease. Possible alcoholic hepatitis reflects diagnostic uncertainty due to another confounding etiology of liver disease or unclear history on alcohol consumption.

### Alcoholic hepatitis: diagnosis and management [^f9a8d7ba]. American Family Physician (2022). Medium credibility.

Alcoholic hepatitis is a clinical syndrome characterized by acute-onset jaundice and liver enzyme abnormalities in the setting of long-term heavy alcohol use. High rates of concomitant infections, systemic inflammation, and multiorgan failure lead to significant morbidity and mortality. Diagnosis of alcoholic hepatitis is primarily clinical, based on a consensus definition from the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism. Initial workup should include chest radiography and cultures of peritoneal fluid, blood, and urine. Close monitoring for inflammation and organ failure is crucial throughout hospitalization. Laboratory-based prognostic scores, including Maddrey Discriminant Function and the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease, help determine disease severity and treatment options. Treatment for moderate disease primarily consists of supportive care, including alcohol cessation and nutritional support. Corticosteroids are recommended for severe alcoholic hepatitis. Responsiveness to corticosteroid therapy should be evaluated using the Lille score on day 7 of treatment. Hospital physicians should involve a multidisciplinary team, including substance abuse specialists, gastroenterologists or hepatologists, nephrologists, dietitians, and intensivists, as appropriate. Long-term follow-up should focus on abstinence from alcohol, management of underlying cirrhosis, and evaluation for liver transplantation if indicated. Pharmacologic treatment of alcohol use disorder can aid patients in maintaining abstinence from alcohol. The presence of underlying cirrhosis and continued alcohol use negatively impact long-term prognosis.

### Donor acquired visceral leishmaniasis following liver transplantation [^ffe73c7c]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Case history

A 57-year-old man underwent orthoptic liver transplantation in March 2019 for alcoholic-related liver disease and portal hypertension, following 2 years of abstinence. The patient was born in Wales and his only travel history outside the UK was a transient visit to Calais, 15 year prior to his transplantation. He was a carpenter and did not work near the ports or places of travel in Wales.

He required a 2-day intensive care admission following transplantation from a brainstem death donor. Immunosuppression was commenced with prednisolone, tacrolimus and mycophenolate (MMF) in conjunction with cotrimoxazole prophylaxis. Both the donor and recipient were CMV IgG negative, therefore, CMV prophylaxis was not required as per hospital policy.

He developed an episode of biopsy-proven moderate acute cellular rejection requiring treatment with 3 days of pulsed steroids 1-month postliver transplant. His graft function gradually improved, with normalisation of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) coinciding with the development of pancytopenia 4 months post-transplantation. His MMF was reduced from 1 g two times a day to 500 mg two times a day in response to this.

Despite this, the patient developed a worsening neutropenia and persistent pancytopenia, with the additional systemic symptoms of fever and rigours. He then was admitted to his local hospital with neutropenic sepsis and an acute kidney injury. He was transferred from his local hospital to our liver transplant centre for further investigation.

He underwent a further series of investigations as summarised in table 1, during his admission. He was treated empirically with meropenem, vancomycin and fluconazole.

Table 1
Summary of pertinent investigations performed throughout this case

A bone marrow biopsy was performed in view his pancytopenia and it showed amastigotes (see figure 1). The Leishmania PCR test detected DNA from the Leishmania donovani complex. Furthermore, the patient's Leishmania serology was strongly positive at a titre equal to or greater than 1 in 102 400 (a titre of 1 in 1600 or above is considered positive). His peripheral blood PCR for Leishmania was negative.

### Alcohol induced thrombocytopenia… [^7c1e4c06]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Alcoholism may be the trigger mechanism of a chain reaction resulting in many and varied syndromes. The alcoholic with neurologic disease, malnutrition, or cirrhosis is a patient familiar to the house officers of any large city hospital. That this patient may also manifest hematologic signs has become increasingly evident during the past decade. The depressant effect of alcohol on erythropoiesis is often associated with folic acid deficiency and resultant megaloblastosis, 1 and occasionally pancytopenia. A recent study suggests that alcoholism is also associated with a defect in cellular iron utilization manifested by a high incidence of ringed sideroblasts in the marrow. 2 These changes have been described in patients who have low serum and red cell folate levels along with megaloblastosis. Recently evidence has begun to accrue that alcohol may induce thrombocytopenia quite apart from its effects on other formed elements of the blood and without relationship to folic acid deficiency.

### New onset pancytopenia in adults: a review of underlying pathologies and their associated clinical and laboratory findings [^0d8cb643]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2014). Low credibility.

Abstract Pancytopenia is regularly encountered in hematology practice, yet there exist few published assessments of the frequencies of various etiologies, and these frequencies exhibit substantial geographic variation. We reviewed bone marrow specimens from pancytopenic adults to determine the most common etiologies and to identify associations with clinical and laboratory findings. Of 132 patients with no history of hematolymphoid neoplasia, no prior bone marrow study for pancytopenia and no recent cytotoxic chemotherapy, 64% had clonal hematopoietic disorders. Most common were myeloid processes: 26% of patients had acute myeloid leukemia, and 17% had myelodysplasia. Less common were lymphoid neoplasms such as non-Hodgkin lymphoma (6%), hairy cell leukemia (5%) and precursor B acute lymphoblastic leukemia (4%). Among non-clonal cases, the most common specific diagnoses were aplastic anemia (5%), megaloblastic anemia (2%) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-related changes (2%). Clonal diagnoses were associated with more severe cytopenias than non-clonal cases. Circulating nucleated erythroid precursors, immature granulocytes and blasts were seen more frequently in clonal cases. Nearly two-thirds of cases of new onset pancytopenia in adults in our North American practice setting have a clonal etiology, with myeloid neoplasms being most common. Blood counts and peripheral smear findings can provide insights into the likelihood of a clonal etiology.

### Trends in the management and burden of alcoholic liver disease [^d7d1be58]. Journal of Hepatology (2015). Low credibility.

Diagnosis of alcoholic liver disease

In its early stages, ALD is a silent disease and can only be detected by laboratory tests or imaging techniques. There are few programs aimed at early detection of ALD at its asymptomatic stages. Some patients with early ALD can show stigmata of alcohol abuse such as bilateral parotid gland hypertrophy, muscle wasting, malnutrition, Dupuytren's sign, and signs of peripheral neuropathy. In patients with cirrhosis, most physical findings are not specific of the etiology. However, some signs such as gynecomastia and extensive spider angiomas may be more frequently seen in those with alcohol as the main cause of liver disease. The diagnosis of ALD is frequently suspected upon documentation of excessive alcohol consumption (> 40–50 g/day) and the presence of clinical and/or biological abnormalities suggestive of liver injury. Laboratory blood tests such as mean corpuscular volume, gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) and aspartate amino transferase (AST) can indicate early ALD whereas advanced ALD is suspected if there is decreased albumin, increased INR, elevated bilirubin level or low platelet count. There are several laboratory markers that estimate persistent alcohol intake. Among them, carbohydrate deficient transferrin and GGT are the most frequently used markers to detect previous alcohol consumption. In patients with ALD, the AST/ALT ratio typically is greater than 1. This ratio is typically greater than 2 in AH and can also be found in patients with advanced cirrhosis regardless of the etiology.

Liver biopsy is not clearly indicated in patients with early stages of ALD or when established cirrhosis is revealed by clinical, analytical and imaging data. The liver biopsy can be done percutaneously in most patients but requires a transjugular approach in patients with a low platelet count and/or a prolonged prothrombin time. The precise indications of liver biopsy are not well established in routine practice. However, it is suggested in patients with aggressive forms of ALD such as AH requiring specific therapies (e.g. corticosteroids and/or pentoxifylline) and in patients with other cofactors suspected of contributing to liver disease. In the setting of clinical trials, the assessment of liver histology by performing a liver biopsy is recommended. The typical findings in patients with ALD include steatosis, hepatocellular damage (ballooning and/or Mallory-Denk bodies), an inflammatory infiltrate basically composed of PMN cells that predominates in the lobules, and a variable degree of fibrosis and lobular distortion that may progress to cirrhosis.

### Thrombocytopenia and liver disease: pathophysiology and periprocedural management [^bde9eefb]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2022). Medium credibility.

Abnormal bleeding in patients with liver disease may result from elevated portal pressure and varix formation, reduced hepatic synthesis of coagulation proteins, qualitative platelet dysfunction, and/or thrombocytopenia. Major mechanisms of thrombocytopenia in liver disease include splenic sequestration and impaired platelet production due to reduced thrombopoietin production. Alcohol and certain viruses may induce marrow suppression. Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) may co-occur in patients with liver disease, particularly those with autoimmune liver disease or chronic hepatitis C. Drugs used for the treatment of liver disease or its complications, such as interferon, immunosuppressants, and antibiotics, may cause thrombocytopenia. Periprocedural management of thrombocytopenia of liver disease depends on both individual patient characteristics and the bleeding risk of the procedure. Patients with a platelet count higher than or equal to 50 000/µL and those requiring low-risk procedures rarely require platelet-directed therapy. For those with a platelet count below 50 000/µL who require a high-risk procedure, platelet-directed therapy should be considered, especially if the patient has other risk factors for bleeding, such as abnormal bleeding with past hemostatic challenges. We often target a platelet count higher than or equal to 50 000/µL in such patients. If the procedure is elective, we prefer treatment with a thrombopoietin receptor agonist; if it is urgent, we use platelet transfusion. In high-risk patients who have an inadequate response to or are otherwise unable to receive these therapies, other strategies may be considered, such as a trial of empiric ITP therapy, spleen-directed therapy, or transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt placement.

### Increased blasts mimicking acute leukemia in a patient with polysubstance abuse [^71b6c245]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Toxic insult to the bone marrow may result in partial or complete suppression, with or without reactive changes, and probable eventual regeneration of hematopoietic elements. During the regenerative process, increased blasts may be observed. Distinguishing these changes from an acute leukemic process can be difficult. In particular, the diagnosis of hypocellular bone marrow with increased blasts, also known as hypocellular or hypoplastic acute leukemia, presents a diagnostic dilemma for pathologists. We report a case of hypocellular marrow with increased blasts in a 50-year-old man with an extensive history of alcohol and drug abuse in whom chemotherapy was deferred. Recovery of peripheral blood cell counts and reticulocytosis occurred with withdrawal of the offending agents, and he remains alive and well 1 year later.

### First case report of acquired copper deficiency following revisional single anastomosis duodeno-ileal bypass with sleeve gastrectomy (SADI-S) leading to severe pancytopenia with refractory anemia [^737da150]. Obesity Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

The patient had undertaken laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) on April 2013 (Fig. 1A) as her weight then was 162 kg (BMI 57 kg/m²). After the LSG, her minimum post-operative weight was 90 kg, the T2DM and hypertension resolved within the first year post-operatively and she was off medications for both conditions. Moreover, her asthma exacerbations became minimal. Weight regain started on the second year post-LSG until she reached 118 kg (BMI 42 kg/m²). Hence, 3 years after her initial LSG, in December 2016, she underwent revisional laparoscopic SADI-S. Eleven months after the SADI-S (November 2017), she presented to our bariatric surgery clinic with the abovementioned complaints, claimed to be adherent to the multivitamin with minerals daily tablets and iron supplements, and denied smoking or alcohol consumption.

Upon examination, she appeared vitally stable, weighed 93.6 kg (BMI 35.6 kg/m²), with normal cardiovascular, chest, and abdominal examinations, and no neurological deficits. She appeared pale and had significant bilateral lower limb edema (Grade 3), and was admitted for inpatient assessment and further management.

Laboratory results upon admission showed microcytic hypochromic anemia, leucopenia, thrombocytopenia, hypoalbuminemia, and high level of vitamin B 12 (Fig. 1C). She was started on IV multivitamins and trace elements, thiamine IV, and high-protein diet, and eventually required total parental nutrition until laboratory results became available. Peripheral blood smear confirmed pancytopenia with cellular atypia (Fig. 1C). Further investigations revealed low ceruloplasmin, and severe deficiencies of copper, zinc, selenium, vitamin D, and folate but normal cholesterol and lipid profile (Fig. 1C). Hemoglobin electrophoresis showed normal hemoglobin pattern.

2.6. Pancytopenia

Twenty-four IMDs in the IEM knowledgebase are associated with pancytopenia. The organic acidurias, methylmalonic aciduria (MMA), isovaleric aciduria (IVA) and propionic aciduria (PA), can all present with pancytopenia during the initial phase of metabolic acidosis. This improves with good metabolic control. Gaucher disease can progress from isolated thrombocytopenia to pancytopenia due to bone marrow infiltration and hypersplenism, as can Niemann-Pick disease type A. Mucolipidosis type II can present with pancytopenia in the neonatal phase which spontaneously improves (personal experience). The inherited disorders of cobalamin metabolism that lead to megaloblastic anemia including transcobalamin II deficiency and intrinsic factor deficiency can all present with a pancytopenia in combination with megaloblastic anemia. Megaloblastic anemia can be diagnosed on a blood film with the combination of hypersegmented neutrophils and oval macrocytosis. There is often an unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia and a markedly elevated LDH which can lead to confusion with a hemolytic picture, but the reticulocyte count is not elevated. Inherited disorders of folate metabolism such as dihydrofolate reductase deficiency and proton coupled folate transport deficiency present with similar hematological features.

### Acquired immune deficiency syndrome and pancytopenia… [^53e447f7]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

A patient with the acquired immune deficiency syndrome experienced pancytopenia during the course of his illness. At the time of maximum depression of the blood cell counts, the hematocrit value was 21%; the WBC count, 1, 000/cu mm; and the platelet count, 27, 000/cu mm. Lymphopenia was persistent but the number of juvenile neutrophils was not diminished. Peripheral blood smears were noteworthy for the presence of atypical monocytes with phagocytic vacuoles. Histiocytic hemophagocytophagia was prominent in bone marrow aspirate specimens. Bone marrow biopsy specimens were usually hypocellular and contained collections of atypical lymphocytes and increased reticulin. These hematologic abnormalities are most likely the consequence of persistent viral infection in an immunocompromised host. Spivak JL, Selonick SE, Quinn TC.

### Melioidosis and hairy cell leukemia in 2 travelers returning from Thailand [^cc637dde]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Melioidosis is endemic to the Pacific region and Southeast Asia. Most cases reported in other regions are imported. In Thailand, where both patients had traveled, the number of cases increased from 11.5/100,000 inhabitants in 1997 to 21.3/100,000 in 2006. The 2 main routes of transmission are transcutaneous and aerosols. Natural disasters, such as flooding, are a risk factor for melioidosis, as for case-patient 1.

This disease has an overall mortality rate of 50%. The clinical spectrum ranges from acute septicemia (mortality rate 80%) to the subacute form. B. pseudomallei is difficult to detect by culture of biologic samples, and serologic analysis or PCR for this bacteria are not routinely available. Therefore, a diagnosis of melioidosis can be easily missed.

Melioidosis occurs mainly in patients with underlying diseases such as diabetes (37%–60% of cases), chronic alcoholism (12%–39%), thalassemia, and chronic nephropathy, and in persons receiving long-term corticosteroid treatment. Reports of patients with melioidosis and hematologic malignancies or solid cancers are scarce. Hairy cell leukemia could now be included in this group of diseases.

Hairy cell leukemia is a rare chronic B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder characterized by pancytopenia; splenomegaly; and infiltration of the bone marrow, spleen, and liver by malignant B cells that have hair-like cytoplasmic projections. The incidence of hairy cell leukemia is < 1 case/100,000 population/year, and the disease accounts for ≈2%–3% of all leukemias in adults in the United States. Infections are a common complication for patients with this disease.

### Procarbazine hydrochloride (Matulane) [^be787656]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

General

Undue toxicity may occur if Matulane is used in patients with impairment of renal and/or hepatic function. When appropriate, hospitalization for the initial course of treatment should be considered.

If radiation or a chemotherapeutic agent known to have marrow-depressant activity has been used, an interval of one month or longer without such therapy is recommended before starting treatment with Matulane. The length of this interval may also be determined by evidence of bone marrow recovery based on successive bone marrow studies.

Prompt cessation of therapy is recommended if any one of the following occurs:

Central nervous system signs or symptoms such as paresthesias, neuropathies or confusion.
Leukopenia (white blood count under 4000).
Thrombocytopenia (platelets under 100,000).
Hypersensitivity reaction.
Stomatitis - The first small ulceration or persistent spot soreness around the oral cavity is a signal for cessation of therapy.
Diarrhea - Frequent bowel movements or watery stools.
Hemorrhage or bleeding tendencies.

Bone marrow depression often occurs 2 to 8 weeks after the start of treatment. If leukopenia occurs, hospitalization of the patient may be needed for appropriate treatment to prevent systemic infection.

Information for Patients

Patients should be warned not to drink alcoholic beverages while on Matulane therapy since there may be an Antabuse (disulfiram)‑like reaction. They should also be cautioned to avoid foods with known high tyramine content such as wine, yogurt, ripe cheese and bananas. Over-the-counter drug preparations which contain antihistamines or sympathomimetic drugs should also be avoided. Patients taking Matulane should also be warned against the use of prescription drugs without the knowledge and consent of their physician. Patients should be advised to discontinue tobacco use.

Laboratory Tests

Baseline laboratory data should be obtained prior to initiation of therapy. The hematologic status as indicated by hemoglobin, hematocrit, white blood count (WBC), differential, reticulocytes and platelets should be monitored closely - at least every 3 or 4 days.

Hepatic and renal evaluation are indicated prior to beginning therapy. Urinalysis, transaminase, alkaline phosphatase and blood urea nitrogen tests should be repeated at least weekly.

### Primary hepatic non-Hodgkin's lymphomas: case report and review of the literature [^9a8512a0]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2003). Low credibility.

A 31-yr-old man presented with a 1-wk history of fever, chills, weakness, headaches, and a significant 20-lb weight loss over the preceding 2 months. His past medical history was relevant for liver amebiasis during childhood. Two days before admission, the patient noticed jaundice. He denied abdominal pain or other GI symptoms, and there was no history of alcohol intake, medications, or illicit drugs. His physical examination revealed generalized jaundice, hepatosplenomegaly, and bilateral leg edema. Neurologically, the patient was agitated, with periods of disorientation, and he had bilateral flapping. His blood tests revealed pancytopenia, renal failure, liver failure, and coagulopathy. Because the patient had a fever, hepatosplenomegaly, and pancytopenia, a further workup also included a bone marrow and liver biopsy. No conclusive diagnosis could be made from the above tests, and the patient died 5 days after admission. Postmortem evaluation, including flow cytometry and gene rearrangement in the tissue obtained from the liver, revealed large B cell lymphoma. This case illustrates an unusual presentation of hepatic non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Current information regarding this entity is scant, mainly owing to its rarity. We present a review of the literature, including the incidence, presentation, treatment, and prognosis of primary hepatic lymphoma.

### How I approach bleeding in hospitalized patients [^30313a26]. Blood (2023). Medium credibility.

Thrombocytopenia is common in patients with liver disease, primarily because of splenic sequestration in patients with portal hypertension but also because of reduced thrombopoietin in those with cirrhosis. Thrombocytopenia may be further exacerbated by marrow suppression because of an infection, acute illness, ongoing alcohol use, or nutritional deficiencies such as inadequate folate intake. Although standard transfusion goals, including platelet counts of ≥ 50 × 10³/μL in noncentral nervous system bleeds and platelet counts ≥ 100 × 10³/μL for central nervous system bleeds are often used, it is unclear whether this is truly necessary because platelet adhesion to the subendothelium appears to be restored in some patients with liver disease. This is believed to be partially due to decreased ADAMTS-13 and increased VWF levels. Thrombin generation appears to be preserved at platelet counts as low as 60 × 10³/μL in patients with cirrhosis. In addition to the standard approach of platelet transfusion to a specific goal, which may be difficult to achieve because of splenic sequestration and/or shortages of blood products, thrombopoietin receptor agonists may be used to increase platelet levels before procedures. Because it can take up to 2 weeks to achieve optimal effect, this is not an adequate solution for acute bleeding. Of note, decreased hemoglobin has also been shown to inversely correlate with an increased bleeding time, supporting improved platelet function; although the impact of this on clinical outcomes has not been studied. Nonetheless, appropriately resuscitating with red blood cells is an important component of managing acute bleeding.

Acute alcoholic hepatitis — patient counseling points emphasize that patients should be encouraged to abstain completely from drinking but offered support even if they fail to achieve abstinence because a reduction in alcohol consumption improves survival, adequate nutrition including calories and protein is necessary for recovery from AH, and patients who drink alcohol at hazardous levels (> 40 g/day) should be advised to report jaundice as soon as it develops because this symptom is a harbinger of serious injury.

### Diagnosis and treatment of alcohol-associated liver diseases: 2019 practice guidance from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^af91ff0e]. Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

Alcoholic hepatitis (AH) — clinical spectrum and histology — has a broad range of presentation in which patients may exhibit few signs or symptoms or present with liver failure; AH per se is a clinical syndrome with a distinct histopathological correlate, called ASH. The histological features of AH may be present in patients with no symptoms and mild laboratory abnormalities, and its histological features consist of neutrophilic lobular inflammation, degenerative changes in hepatocytes (ballooning and Mallory-Denk bodies), steatosis, and pericellular fibrosis. However, these features are variable in individual cases and are often co-existent with frank cirrhosis.

### Clinical and hematological profile of patients with pancytopenia at a tertiary medical center in Ethiopia [^87ebcdf3]. Laboratory Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Pancytopenia is an important hematological problem encountered in routine clinical practice associated with a multitude of disease states. The possible causes of pancytopenia can be influenced by geography, socioeconomic conditions, and endemic illnesses. Information regarding the underlying clinical conditions and morphologic features of blood cells of pancytopenia is limited and varied across different regions. Thus, this study was designed to assess the peripheral morphologic features of blood cells and the underlying clinical causes of pancytopenia.

Methods

A facility-based cross-sectional study was conducted at the Jimma Medical Center hematology laboratory from June 13 to November 13, 2022. A total of 3 mL of whole blood was collected from each subject for complete blood count analysis and peripheral blood morphology examination. Data on sociodemographic and clinical conditions were collected from medical records using a checklist. The data were analyzed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 26.

Results

A total of 163 patients with pancytopenia were identified within the 5 months. Hyper-reactive malarial splenomegaly was the most prevalent cause (29.4%), followed by megaloblastic anemia (20.2%), chronic liver disease (10.4%), and acute leukemia (8.6%). Anisocytosis was the predominant peripheral blood morphology finding (82.2%), along with microcytosis (49.7%), ovalocytosis (31.3%), and macrocytosis (30.7%). Severe anemia was observed in 57% of cases, whereas the majority (92%) exhibited moderate leukopenia. A significant proportion (42.3%) had a platelet count below 50,000/μL.

Conclusion

Unlike previous studies conducted in other parts of the world, this study showed that hyperreactive malarial splenomegaly was the leading cause of pancytopenia. This emphasizes the necessity of considering this condition as a possible cause for pancytopenia, particularly in malaria-endemic areas. The findings of the hematological profiles and peripheral blood morphology strongly suggest that early identification and prompt management of patients with pancytopenia require collaboration between clinical and laboratory investigations.

Leukocytosis is one of the most common laboratory abnormalities in medicine, and one of the most frequent reasons for hematologic consultation. Effective evaluation of leukocytosis requires an attentive history, careful physical examination, meticulous review of the complete blood count and peripheral blood smear, judicious application of laboratory and radiologic testing, and thoughtful analysis. Definitive diagnosis may require bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, imaging studies, and specialized molecular tests. The differential diagnosis of leukocytosis includes physiologic responses to a broad range of infectious and inflammatory processes, as well as numerous primary hematologic disorders such as leukemias, lymphomas, and myeloproliferative neoplasms.

### Zidovudine [^c65f4403]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Hematologic Toxicity/Bone Marrow Suppression

Zidovudine should be used with caution in patients who have bone marrow compromise evidenced by granulocyte count less than 1,000 cells per mm³or hemoglobin less than 9.5 g per dL. Hematologic toxicities appear to be related to pretreatment bone marrow reserve and to dose and duration of therapy. In patients with advanced symptomatic HIV-1 disease, anemia and neutropenia were the most significant adverse events observed. In patients who experience hematologic toxicity, a reduction in hemoglobin may occur as early as 2 to 4 weeks, and neutropenia usually occurs after 6 to 8 weeks. There have been reports of pancytopenia associated with the use of zidovudine, which was reversible in most instances after discontinuance of the drug. However, significant anemia, in many cases requiring dose adjustment, discontinuation of zidovudine, and/or blood transfusions, has occurred during treatment with zidovudine alone or in combination with other antiretrovirals.

Frequent blood counts are strongly recommended to detect severe anemia or neutropenia in patients with poor bone marrow reserve, particularly in patients with advanced HIV-1 disease who are treated with zidovudine. For HIV-1-infected individuals and patients with asymptomatic or early HIV-1 disease, periodic blood counts are recommended. If anemia or neutropenia develops, dosage interruption may be needed [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

5.2 Myopathy

Myopathy and myositis with pathological changes, similar to that produced by HIV-1 disease, have been associated with prolonged use of zidovudine.

5.3 Lactic Acidosis and Severe Hepatomegaly with Steatosis

Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogues, including zidovudine. A majority of these cases have been in women. Female sex and obesity may be risk factors for the development of lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis in patients treated with antiretroviral nucleoside analogues. Treatment with zidovudine should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity, which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations.

### Platelet IgG antibodies are significantly increased in chronic liver disease [^166d8b21]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Thrombocytopenia is a common finding in patients with chronic liver disease (CLD). More than one third of cirrhotic patients develop clinically apparent thrombocytopenia. In many cases, the severity of thrombocytopenia is directly related with the stage of CLD.

The cause of thrombocytopenia in CLD patients is complex. The sequestration of platelets in the splenic pool attributed to hypersplenism, the increased destruction of platelets and the reduced production of them in the bone marrow contribute to thrombocytopenia. The redistribution of platelets in the splenic pool is considered the most important cause of thrombocytopenia in CLD patients. The increased destruction of circulating platelets is the second most important cause of thrombocytopenia and it is due to activation of low-grade disseminated intravascular coagulation and increased destruction of platelets through autoimmune mechanisms In fact, platelets isolated from patients with CLD of diverse etiology (such as chronic viral hepatitis, alcoholic hepatitis, alcoholic cirrhosis and primary biliary cirrhosis) had increased levels of bound immunoglobulins that were combined with high levels of circulating immune complexes in serum. No correlation between the size of the spleen and the amount of platelet specific immunoglobulin was found, and this may partly explain the inconstant relationship between the size of the spleen and the degree of thrombocytopenia in patients with chronic liver disease.

Thrombocytopenia develops only if the increased production of platelets in the bone marrow cannot counterbalance the increased removal of platelets from the circulation. Infections, drugs, toxins and deficiencies of nutrients can suppress the bone marrow and actually aggravate thrombocytopenia in CLD patients.

Few previous studies have demonstrated the presence of true antiplatelet (anti-P) antibodies in CLD patients. The aim of this study was to investigate the presence of IgG anti-P antibodies in patients with chronic liver diseases of diverse but well-defined etiology, since so far there is no well established data with regard to the prevalence of these antibodies among patients with liver diseases. In addition, this study tried to appreciate the influence of anti-P antibodies on the degree of thrombocytopenia in CLD patients.

### An 8-year-old boy with fever, splenomegaly, and pancytopenia [^218c5fd6]. Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

An 8-year-old boy with no significant past medical history presented to his pediatrician with 5 days of fever, diffuse abdominal pain, and pallor. The pediatrician referred the patient to the emergency department (ED), out of concern for possible malignancy. Initial vital signs indicated fever, tachypnea, and tachycardia. Physical examination was significant for marked abdominal distension, hepatosplenomegaly, and abdominal tenderness in the right upper and lower quadrants. Initial laboratory studies were notable for pancytopenia as well as an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis showed massive splenomegaly. The only significant history of travel was immigration from Albania 10 months before admission. The patient was admitted to a tertiary care children's hospital and was evaluated by hematology-oncology, infectious disease, genetics, and rheumatology subspecialty teams. Our multidisciplinary panel of experts will discuss the evaluation of pancytopenia with apparent multiorgan involvement and the diagnosis and appropriate management of a rare disease.

### Bartonella quintana endocarditis in persons experiencing homelessness, new york, new york, USA, 2020–2023 [^4d359a01]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Case 4 Description

A middle-aged man with a history of asthma, bipolar disorder, alcohol use disorder, hepatitis C infection, pancytopenia, and experiencing unsheltered homelessness sought care at an emergency department in the winter of 2022 with dyspnea and bilateral lower extremity edema over the previous 2 months. He was hospitalized for fluid overload with suspected acute HF. At admission, the patient's vital signs were unremarkable, and no signs or symptoms of systemic infection were noted (Table). Laboratory tests revealed anemia, hypoalbuminemia, and elevated pro-BNP. Chest radiograph showed pulmonary congestion and bilateral pleural effusions.

TTE showed AR, mitral regurgitation, tricuspid regurgitation, mild pulmonary hypertension, and suspected mobile vegetations on the AV. Healthcare providers collected blood cultures before initiating treatment with intravenous vancomycin and ceftriaxone for suspected bacterial endocarditis. Initial and repeated blood cultures remained negative after 21 days. Because of the patient's recent unsheltered homelessness and reported exposure to cats, dogs, and lice, Bartonella endocarditis was considered. Clinicians changed the antimicrobial treatment to doxycycline and rifampin. Serologic testing detected elevated IgG titers to B. henselae of 1:2,560 and B. quintana of 1:640. B. henselae IgM titers were negative.

The patient underwent tissue AV replacement 10 days after admission. Bacterial, fungal, and mycobacterial cultures of the AV tissue were negative. Healthcare providers identified B. quintana from the explanted AV by using Sanger sequencing of amplicons obtained from PCR assays targeting 16S rRNA and ribC genes. The patient was discharged from the hospital and recommended to complete a 12-week course of doxycycline and 6-week course of rifampin. However, he continued to experience unsheltered homelessness and reported that he was unable to complete the recommended regimen because his medications were stolen.

### Modified Delphi panel consensus recommendations for management of severe aplastic anemia [^ed6144f2]. Blood Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Tests to diagnose acquired SAA and rule out IBMF syndromes

Therapy for acquired SAA should not be delayed while awaiting test results to rule out IBMF syndromes unless there are clinical features suggestive of an IBMF. The following should be obtained in all patients: a complete blood count with differential, review of peripheral blood smear, reticulocyte count, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) assessment by flow cytometry of peripheral blood, and BM biopsy and aspirate with karyotype. Given the poor growth of cytogenetics culture in cases of AA and to exclude hypocellular myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for MDS-associated cytogenic abnormalities is recommended. Somatic next-generation sequencing (NGS) gene panels for genes frequently mutated in hematologic malignancies have become standard in the evaluation of suspected BM failure. Although somatic mutations are commonly seen in both AA and in hypocellular MDS, the inclusion of somatic NGS sequencing panels, supported by commonly used practice guidelines, can help with baseline assessment, including identification of MDS-defining variants, and can be informative prognostically and in longitudinal follow-up of clonal evolution. HLA tissue typing should be ordered upfront for patients of all ages who are candidates for HSCT. Comprehensive ancillary studies to exclude transient etiologies of pancytopenia (eg, nutritional deficiencies or viral and other infections) should also be done in all patients.

### Physical function as a predictor of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy in patients with pancreatic cancer [^aabb16bd]. BMC Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pancreatic cancer is one of the most common cancers worldwide, with a poor 5-year survival rate of just 6% and a rank of seven among the leading causes of cancer death worldwide. However, a combination of surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy has been shown to improve survival rates for pancreatic cancer compared with those for surgery alone (5-year survival rate of 20.7% vs. 10.4%). Common chemotherapy drugs after radical resection for pancreatic cancer include modified leucovorin, 5-fluorouracil, irinotecan, oxaliplatin (mFOLFIRINOX), gemcitabine, and capecitabine. While the administration of chemotherapy may improve survival outcomes, it has several undesirable side effects, including hematologic toxicities (e.g. pancytopenia, neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia), fatigue, and peripheral neuropathy.

Peripheral neuropathy is a common side effect of oxaliplatin and nab-paclitaxel, with a prevalence of 19 ∼ 85%. Many factors have been identified as risk factors for chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN), including older age, obesity, hypomagnesemia, hypoalbuminemia, anemia, alcohol, diabetes mellitus, inherited neuropathy, endocrinologic and metabolic alterations, medications (such as insulin, metronidazole, misonidazole, sulfasalazine, or phenytoin), and a higher cumulative dose of chemotherapy. Furthermore, a previous study also reported that age and the number of chemotherapy cycles are significant CIPN risk factors in patients with pancreatic cancer. CIPN is generally diagnosed when a patient who is receiving chemotherapy experiences new pain or numbness in the distal portions of the extremities. The diagnosis can be supported by neurological physical examination, nerve conduction studies, electromyography, quantitative sensory testing, patient complaints, and general quality of life assessment scales, such as the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-Chemotherapy-Induced Peripheral Neuropathy 20-item scale (EORTC QLQ-CIPN20).

### Methotrexate (Otrexup) [^0553861a]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Unexpectedly severe (sometimes fatal) bone marrow suppression and aplastic anemia have been reported with concomitant administration of methotrexate (usually in high dosage) along with some nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

Hepatic:

Otrexup has the potential for acute (elevated transaminases) and chronic (fibrosis and cirrhosis) hepatotoxicity. Chronic toxicity is potentially fatal; it generally has occurred after prolonged use (generally two years or more) and after a total dose of at least 1.5 grams. In studies in psoriatic patients, hepatotoxicity appeared to be a function of total cumulative dose and appeared to be enhanced by alcoholism, obesity, diabetes and advanced age. An accurate incidence rate has not been determined; the rate of progression and reversibility of lesions is not known. Special caution is indicated in the presence of preexisting liver damage or impaired hepatic function.

In psoriasis, liver function tests, including serum albumin, should be performed periodically prior to dosing but are often normal in the face of developing fibrosis or cirrhosis. These lesions may be detectable only by biopsy. The usual recommendation is to obtain a liver biopsy at 1) pretherapy or shortly after initiation of therapy (2 to 4 months), 2) a total cumulative dose of 1.5 grams, and 3) after each additional 1.0 to 1.5 grams. Moderate fibrosis or any cirrhosis normally leads to discontinuation of the drug; mild fibrosis normally suggests a repeat biopsy in 6 months.

### White cell count and platelet count associate with histological alcoholic hepatitis in jaundiced harmful drinkers [^3105b78d]. BMC Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with suspected alcoholic hepatitis and a Discriminant Function ≥ 32 underwent liver biopsy to confirm the diagnosis. Of these (n = 58), 43 had histological features of alcoholic hepatitis and 15 (25%) did not.

We aimed to determine the laboratory features that differentiated those patients with a histological diagnosis of alcoholic hepatitis from those without, and assess potential clinical utility.

Methods

Laboratory investigations at presentation for each of the histologically confirmed cases of alcoholic hepatitis (n = 43) were compared to those without (n = 15) to determine whether there were differences between the two groups. Univariate analysis was by Mann Whitney U Test and Multivariate analysis was by a stepwise approach.

Results

White cell count (16.2 ± 10.5 v 6.9 ± 3.5 (× 10⁹/L); p = 0.0001) and platelet count (178 ± 81 v 98.4 ± 43 (× 10⁹/L); p = 0.0005) were higher in the patients with histological features of alcoholic hepatitis than in those without. The area under the ROC curve for AH diagnosis was estimated to be 0.83 (0.73, 0.94) and 0.81 (0.69, 0.93) for white cell count and platelet count respectively.

Conclusions

Clinicians cannot accurately differentiate patients with or without alcoholic hepatitis without liver biopsy. This is critically important when deciding on specific therapies such as corticosteroids or when interpreting data from future trials in which biopsy is not mandated. In situations where liver biopsy is unsuitable or unavailable the white cell and platelet counts can be used to determine the likelihood of histological alcoholic hepatitis and guide treatment.

### Case report: COVID associated pancytopenia unmasking previously undiagnosed pernicious anemia [^3c7ebe74]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2022). Medium credibility.

CASE PRESENTATION

A 24-year-old active duty African American male presented to emergency room 18 days post COVID pneumonia infection, complaining of persistent fatigue, weakness, and subjective weight loss. He stated that his initial symptoms of dysgeusia, anosmia, headache, and fever had previously resolved since his initial COVID-positive test. He had no family history of blood disorders and had no significant past medical and surgical history. He was on no medications or supplements at the time of admission. Initial investigation with a complete blood count revealed a hemoglobin (HGB) of 4.1 g/dL, white blood cells (WBC) of 4.1 g/dL, and platelets (PLTs) of 64 × 10⁹/L. His anemia was normocytic (mean corpuscular volume [MCV] 95.3) and normochromic (mean corpuscular hemoglobin [MCH] 32.0). His leukopenia was lymphocytes predominant (55% lymphocytes, 33% granulocytes, and 6% monocytes). A peripheral smear was done which showed moderate oval macrocytes, anisocytosis, poikilocytosis, schistocytes, and atypical lymphocytes most consistent with a hypocellular sample with dilution. The patient was admitted to the medicine ward for blood transfusion, volume resuscitation, and further workup.

Diagnostic evaluation for hypo-proliferation, hemolysis, and malnutrition was initiated. There was concern for a hemolytic process so a bilirubin level was obtained, which was elevated at 3.4 mg/dL with indirect bilirubin predominance at 1.8mg/dL, and lactate dehydrogenase was elevated suggesting a hemolytic anemia. However, his reticulocyte index was 0.13, consistent with hypo-proliferation. Direct antithrombin test was also negative. He was transfused 2 units of pack red blood cells and had an appropriate rise in hemoglobin to > 7 g/dL. We continued to work the patient up with multiple viral panels, Leptospirosis, cold agglutinins, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and antinuclear antibodies (ANA) to rule out other causes of his presentation. Flow cytometry cytogenetic analysis revealed no evidence of an acquired clonal abnormality.

### Diagnosis and treatment of alcohol-associated liver diseases: 2019 practice guidance from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^e5687d32]. Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

Alcohol-associated hepatitis — evaluation of corticosteroid contraindications and timing: Because infections are common and can mimic presentation, providers should obtain corresponding cultures and a chest radiograph on presentation, and abdominal imaging is important to evaluate for other causes of jaundice. Sufficient time should be allowed to assess infection or other contraindications, with trials initiating prednisolone within 6 days of presentation. If infection is present, appropriate antibiotics should be provided and, once controlled, corticosteroids should be started immediately. Although severe infections have been reported, the presence of infection alone has not been shown to be a driver of short-term mortality, and response to corticosteroids based on the Lille score is significantly associated with improved survival despite infection. Evidence for corticosteroids in acute kidney injury (AKI) is lacking; if AKI can be resolved, corticosteroid treatment should be reconsidered. Regarding gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), a retrospective cohort (n = 105) found 55% presented with GIB; prednisolone was started a mean of 5 days after bleeding, with no differences in survival at 1, 3, and 6 months versus those without GIB. The study suggests GIB is not an absolute contraindication and that after control of GIB, prednisolone can be given safely.

### ACG clinical guideline: alcoholic liver disease [^6b947ede]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) comprises a clinical-histologic spectrum including fatty liver, alcoholic hepatitis (AH), and cirrhosis with its complications. Most patients are diagnosed at advanced stages and data on the prevalence and profile of patients with early disease are limited. Diagnosis of ALD requires documentation of chronic heavy alcohol use and exclusion of other causes of liver disease. Prolonged abstinence is the most effective strategy to prevent disease progression. AH presents with rapid onset or worsening of jaundice, and in severe cases may transition to acute on chronic liver failure when the risk for mortality, depending on the number of extra-hepatic organ failures, may be as high as 20–50% at 1 month. Corticosteroids provide short-term survival benefit in about half of treated patients with severe AH and long-term mortality is related to severity of underlying liver disease and is dependent on abstinence from alcohol. General measures in patients hospitalized with ALD include inpatient management of liver disease complications, management of alcohol withdrawal syndrome, surveillance for infections and early effective antibiotic therapy, nutritional supplementation, and treatment of the underlying alcohol-use disorder. Liver transplantation, a definitive treatment option in patients with advanced alcoholic cirrhosis, may also be considered in selected patients with AH cases, who do not respond to medical therapy. There is a clinical unmet need to develop more effective and safer therapies for patients with ALD.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for folate deficiency, more specifically with respect to CBC and peripheral blood smear, BSH 2014 guidelines recommend to consider suspecting cobalamin or folate deficiency in patients in whom blood film shows oval macrocytes and hypersegmented neutrophils in the presence of an elevated MCV.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^c1d63df8]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Cholestatic liver diseases — evaluation of elevated alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and the role of gamma‑glutamyl transferase (GGT) is outlined as follows: cholestatic liver diseases are associated with elevated alkaline phosphatase, with or without elevated bilirubin, and once alkaline phosphatase has been confirmed to be of hepatic origin, an ultrasound of the liver should be performed to assess the hepatic parenchyma and bile ducts. Biliary dilatation suggests an extrahepatic cause, whereas a non-dilated biliary system suggests that the cause of elevated alkaline phosphatase is intrahepatic; some disease of extrahepatic cholestasis may not be apparent by ultrasound and cholangiography by MR/MRCP or endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography should be undertaken when these disorders are suspected. With isolated alkaline phosphatase elevation, confirmation with GGT, or fractionation of alkaline phosphatase isoenzymes can be used to help differentiate alkaline phosphatase from non-liver sources; however, GGT elevation is not specific for cholestatic liver disease and can be elevated in > 50% of alcoholic patients without obvious evidence of liver disease, so GGT should not be used as a screening test for underlying liver disease in the absence of abnormal liver chemistries. In hospitalized patients with isolated alkaline phosphatase elevations, one study reported that ~80% could be given a clinical diagnosis solely based on history and physical examination, routine labs, and chest X-ray.

### White cell count and platelet count associate with histological alcoholic hepatitis in jaundiced harmful drinkers [^3412699e]. BMC Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with suspected alcoholic hepatitis and a Discriminant Function ≥ 32 underwent liver biopsy to confirm the diagnosis. Of these (n = 58), 43 had histological features of alcoholic hepatitis and 15 (25%) did not. We aimed to determine the laboratory features that differentiated those patients with a histological diagnosis of alcoholic hepatitis from those without, and assess potential clinical utility.

Methods

Laboratory investigations at presentation for each of the histologically confirmed cases of alcoholic hepatitis (n = 43) were compared to those without (n = 15) to determine whether there were differences between the two groups. Univariate analysis was by Mann Whitney U Test and Multivariate analysis was by a stepwise approach.

Results

White cell count (16.2 ± 10.5 v 6.9 ± 3.5 (× 10⁹/L); p = 0.0001) and platelet count (178 ± 81 v 98.4 ± 43 (× 10⁹/L); p = 0.0005) were higher in the patients with histological features of alcoholic hepatitis than in those without. The area under the ROC curve for AH diagnosis was estimated to be 0.83 (0.73, 0.94) and 0.81 (0.69, 0.93) for white cell count and platelet count respectively.

Conclusions

Clinicians cannot accurately differentiate patients with or without alcoholic hepatitis without liver biopsy. This is critically important when deciding on specific therapies such as corticosteroids or when interpreting data from future trials in which biopsy is not mandated. In situations where liver biopsy is unsuitable or unavailable the white cell and platelet counts can be used to determine the likelihood of histological alcoholic hepatitis and guide treatment.

### Splenic accumulation of Tc-99m HMDP in a patient with severe alcoholic cirrhosis of the liver [^9d6729e2]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

The authors report unusual splenic accumulation of Tc-99m hydroxymethylene diphosphonate (HMDP) on bone scintigraphy of a patient with alcoholic cirrhosis of the liver. Laboratory studies showed hemolytic anemia and hemochromatosis resulting from alcohol abuse, both of which are thought to be related to the diffuse splenic uptake observed. When diffuse splenic accumulation by Tc-99m HMDP is seen, the existence of alcoholic hepatopathy might be considered.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^8cb8652d]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

ACG Clinical Guideline — actions by aminotransferase severity specify etiologic evaluation thresholds and urgent referral criteria. For ALT and/or AST levels > 5X ULN, evaluate for viral hepatitis B and C, alcoholic and NAFLD, hemochromatosis, Wilson's disease, alpha‑1‑antitrypsin deficiency, autoimmune hepatitis, and consider drugs/supplement‑related, ischemic, and DILI causes. For 5–15X ULN, also assess for acute hepatitis A, B, and C in addition to etiologies for AST/ALT elevation less than 5× ULN. For > 15X ULN, or massive ALT > 10,000 IU/L, also assess for acetaminophen toxicity and ischemic hepatopathy (shock liver). A patient with acute hepatitis plus elevated prothrombin time and/or encephalopathy requires immediate referral to a liver specialist. All are Strong recommendation, very low level of evidence.

Alcoholic hepatitis (AH) — consensus clinical criteria and categories — define clinical diagnosis by onset of jaundice within prior 8 weeks; ongoing consumption of > 40 (female) or 60 (male) g alcohol/day for ≥ 6 months with < 60 days of abstinence before the onset of jaundice; AST > 50, AST/ALT > 1.5, and both values < 400 IU/L; and serum total bilirubin > 3.0 mg/dL. Potential confounding factors include possible ischemic hepatitis (e.g., severe upper gastrointestinal bleed, hypotension, or cocaine use within 7 days), possible drug-induced liver disease (suspect drug within 30 days of onset of jaundice), uncertain alcohol use assessment, and presence of atypical laboratory tests such as AST < 50 or > 400 IU/L, AST/ALT < 1.5, ANA > 1:160 or SMA > 1:80. Categorization includes Definite AH (clinically diagnosed and biopsy proven), Probable AH (clinically diagnosed without potential confounding factors), and Possible AH (clinically diagnosed with potential confounding factors); biopsy needed for confirmation of AH.
