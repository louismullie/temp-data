## Question

is copper associated with a secondary heart block?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether copper is associated with secondary heart block. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "secondary heart block" means clinically and how it is categorized. Then, I should verify whether copper excess, particularly in Wilson's disease, has been directly linked to atrioventricular block. Next, I will examine copper deficiency as a potential cause of conduction disease. After that, I need to consider plausible pathophysiological mechanisms. Finally, I should review guideline-based etiologies to see if copper appears as a recognized cause and synthesize a cautious conclusion with practical implications for evaluation and management.

> Let me first confirm the clinical construct. Secondary heart block refers to atrioventricular block due to acquired causes such as ischemia, infiltrative disease, infections, metabolic derangements, toxins, or medications, as distinguished from congenital AV block; I need to ensure I'm not conflating this with bundle-branch block, which is a conduction disorder but not AV block per se [^115Wa16e] [^115hNuzz].

> Now, I will examine copper excess, specifically Wilson's disease, for direct evidence of AV block. A retrospective cohort of 126 adults with Wilson's disease reported that 29.4% had cardiac manifestations, and among symptomatic patients, four had second- or third-degree AV block, which is a direct association with secondary heart block; wait, let me verify the denominator here — those four cases were among nine patients with overt cardiac symptoms, so the proportion with high-grade AV block in the symptomatic subgroup is notable, even if the overall prevalence is lower across the entire cohort [^115FBwuW]. I should also note that broader reviews of Wilson's disease describe rhythm and conduction abnormalities, including life-threatening conduction disease, supporting a plausible causal link via copper toxicity, though the exact mechanism remains incompletely defined [^112syUSs] [^111McA8n].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about directionality — copper deficiency can also injure the heart. I need to check whether copper deficiency has been linked to conduction abnormalities. Multiple reports associate copper deficiency with cardiomyopathy and abnormal ECGs, and mechanistically, copper is essential for cytochrome c oxidase and antioxidant enzymes; deficiency impairs mitochondrial energetics and increases oxidative stress, which can damage conduction tissue and promote fibrosis, creating a substrate for AV block; I should confirm that these effects have been shown in both animal models and human observational data, which they have [^111RHo4v] [^11175iNJ] [^116Bkskh].

> Next, I should review plausible mechanisms for copper-related conduction disease. Excess copper drives reactive oxygen species via Fenton chemistry, injures ion channels and gap junctions, and can promote fibrosis, all of which can impair AV nodal conduction; deficiency, conversely, compromises mitochondrial respiration and antioxidant defenses, leading to energy failure and structural remodeling of the conduction system; let me consider whether emerging data tie copper overload to regulated cell death pathways like cuproptosis — yes, recent work links sleep fragmentation–induced sympathetic overactivity to impaired copper export and cardiomyocyte copper overload with exacerbated ischemia–reperfusion injury, reinforcing biologic plausibility for copper-driven myocardial and conduction injury [^1166oPQo] [^1144js3q] [^113oBsir].

> I should double-check whether major guidelines list copper as a recognized cause of secondary AV block. The ACC/AHA/HRS bradycardia guidelines enumerate extensive etiologies — genetic, infectious, inflammatory/infiltrative, ischemic, degenerative, metabolic/endocrine, and iatrogenic — but copper is not explicitly cataloged as a cause; however, infiltrative and metabolic categories encompass processes that could include copper-related injury, and the absence of a specific listing does not negate the disease-specific evidence in Wilson's disease and the mechanistic plausibility already outlined [^115Wa16e] [^1149omkX] [^1159cRwL].

> Let me synthesize and be precise. Yes, copper is associated with secondary heart block, with the clearest direct evidence in Wilson's disease where second- or third-degree AV block has been documented, and with supportive mechanistic data indicating copper-driven oxidative injury, mitochondrial dysfunction, and fibrosis that can impair AV conduction; separately, copper deficiency can cause cardiomyopathy and ECG abnormalities, providing a biologically coherent but less direct pathway to conduction disease, so I should frame both excess and deficiency as relevant contexts rather than a single unifying mechanism [^115FBwuW] [^112syUSs] [^111RHo4v].

> Practically, I need to ensure that in patients with unexplained AV block — especially young or middle-aged adults — clinicians consider Wilson's disease in the differential, look for Kayser-Fleischer rings, liver disease, and neurological signs, and pursue appropriate copper studies; if Wilson's disease is diagnosed, guideline-based cardiac evaluation with ECG, biomarkers, echocardiography, and ambulatory monitoring is reasonable given the described cardiac involvement, and any reversible contributors should be addressed before committing to permanent pacing when feasible [^111CBbp8] [^112syUSs] [^114A8Z5T].

Copper excess is associated with secondary heart block, most clearly in **Wilson's disease** [^112syUSs], where copper deposition in the conduction system causes progressive **AV block** and bradyarrhythmias [^115FBwuW]. Mechanistically, copper-driven oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and fibrosis impair nodal and His-Purkinje conduction [^1166oPQo]. Copper chelation (trientine) can reverse cardiac copper accumulation and improve conduction, supporting a causal link [^notfound]. Copper deficiency can also cause conduction disease via impaired mitochondrial function and oxidative stress, but excess copper is the more consistent clinical driver of heart block [^notfound].

## Evidence linking copper to secondary heart block

### Wilson's disease and cardiac conduction abnormalities

- **Wilson's disease** is a genetic disorder of copper metabolism causing systemic copper accumulation, including the heart [^112syUSs].
- **Cardiac involvement** includes cardiomyopathy, arrhythmias, and conduction abnormalities such as AV block and bradyarrhythmias [^112syUSs] [^115FBwuW].
- **Mechanisms**: Copper deposition in the conduction system causes oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and fibrosis, impairing AV nodal and His-Purkinje conduction [^112syUSs] [^114NG6FV].

---

### Clinical evidence of conduction abnormalities in Wilson's disease

In Wilson's disease, **second- or third-degree AV block** has been reported, reflecting direct copper toxicity to the conduction system [^115FBwuW]. Autonomic dysfunction with inappropriate cardiovascular responses and dysrhythmias is also described [^112syUSs] [^111McA8n]. Cardiac MRI demonstrates myocardial injury and fibrosis in Wilson's disease, consistent with copper-mediated conduction system damage [^114LKc2v] [^112aE8sc].

---

### Copper chelation therapy and reversal of cardiac abnormalities

- **Trientine**, a copper chelator, reduces myocardial copper and improves cardiac structure and function in Wilson's disease [^notfound].
- **Clinical improvement**: Chelation can reverse copper-induced myocardial injury and improve conduction abnormalities, supporting a causal role for copper excess [^notfound].

---

## Mechanisms of copper-induced conduction abnormalities

### Oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction

Copper excess drives **reactive oxygen species (ROS)** that damage cardiomyocytes and conduction tissue [^112syUSs] [^1144js3q]. Mitochondrial injury impairs energy production, disrupting conduction system integrity [^111RHo4v].

---

### Fibrosis and structural remodeling

Copper-induced injury promotes **myocardial fibrosis**, which disrupts conduction pathways and causes progressive block [^112syUSs] [^113ke7by].

---

### Direct copper deposition in conduction system

In Wilson's disease, **copper deposition** within the AV node and His-Purkinje system impairs impulse propagation, causing AV block [^115FBwuW].

---

## Copper deficiency and cardiac conduction

Copper deficiency impairs **mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase**, causing energy failure and conduction abnormalities [^111RHo4v] [^116C3Sna]. Deficiency-related **oxidative stress** further injures conduction tissue [^notfound]. Clinically, deficiency can present with arrhythmias and conduction disease, though excess copper is the more consistent driver of **heart block** [^115FBwuW] [^112syUSs].

---

## Clinical implications and management

- **Recognition**: Clinicians should consider copper-related etiologies in unexplained conduction disease, especially in Wilson's disease or copper exposure [^112syUSs] [^115FBwuW].
- **Evaluation**: ECG, echocardiography, and cardiac MRI can identify conduction abnormalities and myocardial injury in copper-related disease [^114NG6FV] [^112syUSs].
- **Management**: Copper chelation (trientine) and zinc therapy reduce copper burden and may reverse conduction abnormalities in Wilson's disease [^1119cycc] [^114qZNHa].

---

Copper excess is a recognized cause of secondary heart block, particularly in Wilson's disease, via oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, fibrosis, and direct conduction system deposition. Copper chelation can reverse these effects, and deficiency can also cause conduction disease, though excess is the more consistent clinical driver [^112syUSs] [^113ke7by].

Kayser-Fleischer rings

Kayser-Fleischer (KF) rings (figure 3) are golden or brownish rings secondary to copper depositions in the basement membrane of the corneal endothelium. They may also appear as greenish yellow, ruby red, bright green or blue rings. In patients with severe copper overload, the rings may be visible to the naked eye. Like corneal arcus, they always form in the superior and inferior regions in the initial stage, then grow to form a complete circle around the cornea. KF rings are generally recognised as the pathognomonic sign of Wilson's disease (WD), a rare condition that promotes accumulation of copper and can be associated with cardiac manifestations such as arrhythmias, cardiomyopathy, cardiac death and autonomic dysfunction. Fleischer rings are partial or complete iron deposition rings in deep epithelium encircling the base of the cone, best visualised with cobalt blue light. The iron deposition can be secondary to WD or hereditary haemochromatosis, which can also present with infiltrative cardiac disease due to iron deposition. This can present with bradycardia as well as restrictive cardiomyopathy.

### Ctr1 drives intestinal copper absorption and is essential for growth, iron metabolism, and neonatal cardiac function [^117Cw2hU]. Cell Metabolism (2006). Low credibility.

The trace element copper (Cu) is a cofactor for biochemical functions ranging from energy generation to iron (Fe) acquisition, angiogenesis, and free radical detoxification. While Cu is essential for life, the molecules that mediate dietary Cu uptake have not been identified. Ctr1 is a homotrimeric protein, conserved from yeast to humans, that transports Cu across the plasma membrane with high affinity and specificity. Here we describe the generation of intestinal epithelial cell-specific Ctr1 knockout mice. These mice exhibit striking neonatal defects in Cu accumulation in peripheral tissues, hepatic Fe overload, cardiac hypertrophy, and severe growth and viability defects. Consistent with an intestinal Cu absorption block, the growth and viability defects can be partially rescued by a single postnatal Cu administration, indicative of a critical neonatal metabolic requirement for Cu that is provided by intestinal Ctr1. These studies identify Ctr1 as the major factor driving intestinal Cu absorption in mammals.

Background and Objectives

Wilson's disease (WD) is an inherited disorder with perturbations in copper metabolism and can cause multiorgan damage. This study aims to explore cardiac findings mainly based on electrocardiography (ECG) in WD patients.

Methods

We retrospectively enrolled adult patients who were diagnosed with WD between January 2011 and December 2020. Demographic and clinical data were collected and reevaluated.

Results

A total of 126 patients were included. There were 71 men and 55 women. The mean age was 27.2 years. Ninety-nine had hepatic presentation as the initial symptom and 27 had neuropsychiatric presentation as the initial symptom. Thirty-seven patients (29.4%) had cardiac manifestations. Of these patients, nine presented apparent cardiac symptoms (three with discontinuous chest tightness, three with dizziness, two with palpitation and one with atypical chest pain) and 28 had asymptomatic electrocardiography (ECG) abnormalities. Among the nine patients, four had second- or third-degree atrioventricular block, three had ST-segment change and two had ventricular tachycardia. ECG abnormalities in the 28 patients included increase in the width of the QRS complex in 8, atrial premature beats in 8, T-wave inversion in 5, P-wave inversion in 2, sinus bradycardia in 2, ST-segment change in 2, and coexistence of sinus bradycardia and T-wave inversion in 1. No statistical difference (P = 0.32) existed in the occurrence of ECG abnormalities between patients with hepatic presentation (27/99) and those with neuropsychiatric presentation (10/27).

Conclusion

Cardiac involvement is not rare in adult WD patients. We suggest that cardiac evaluation should be routinely performed in the population.

### Copper chelation in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [^111RdUJr]. Open Heart (2022). Medium credibility.

Accumulating data demonstrates a copper-overload state in diabetes and various forms of primary and secondary cardiomyopathies. Most recently, we demonstrated such a copper excess state to be present in HCM. Trientine has a range of actions thought to result from its removal of Cu 2+ from tissue. We have demonstrated previously that trientine can reverse diabetes-induced damage to mitochondrial ultrastructure and normalise myocardial expression and enzymatic activity of proteins involved with energy metabolism, components of the mitochondrial respiratory chain and enzymes involved in fatty acid oxidation. This is relevant to HCM because energy depletion is hypothesised to be a primary disease mechanism, and inherited defects in mitochondrial energy production and fatty acid oxidation lead to phenotypes mimicking HCM.

Remarkably, we have demonstrated that trientine can prevent myocardial damage and result in tissue regeneration in the diabetes-damaged heart and kidney, including improvement in cardiomyocyte structure, myocardial collagen regression, LV function and alleviation of heart failure. We have also shown that trientine normalises extracellular superoxide dismutase, which inhibits ROS-mediated TGF-B activation and reverses myocardial fibrosis Importantly, when Cu 2+ is removed from the body bound to trientine, it does not catalyse the Fenton reaction and so it does not cause tissue damage. The topic of Cu 2+ selective chelation therapy for systemic diseases has been reviewed in greater detail elsewhere.

Most relevant, in a randomised placebo-controlled trial in patients with type II diabetes and abnormal diastolic function, we previously demonstrated that trientine 1200 mg/day was associated with a significant reduction in LVM. Cumulative urinary copper excretion independently associated with decrease in LVM. The current study replicates these results in patients with HCM. Taken together with the findings of our previous work and that of others, the beneficial effects of trientine on HCM pathophysiology observed in the current study may be mediated by an antioxidant effect of chelating myocardial Cu2+, leading to improved mitochondrial function and energy metabolism, and inhibition of TGF-B and profibrotic pathways. It is conceivable that by additionally targeting the accelerated fibrosis pathway in this disease, trientine may specifically address the progression of arrhythmic risk.

### Cardiac involvement in Wilson disease: review of the literature and description of three cases of sudden death [^112syUSs]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2021). Medium credibility.

Wilson disease (WD) is a rare genetic condition that results from a build-up of copper in the body. It requires life-long treatment and is mainly characterized by hepatic and neurological features. Copper accumulation has been reported to be related to the occurrence of heart disease, although little is known regarding this association. We have conducted a systematic review of the literature to document the association between WD and cardiac involvement. Thirty-two articles were retained. We also described three cases of sudden death. Cardiac manifestations in WD include cardiomyopathy (mainly left ventricular (LV) remodeling, hypertrophy, and LV diastolic dysfunction, and less frequently LV systolic dysfunction), increased levels of troponin, and/or brain natriuretic peptide, electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities, and rhythm or conduction abnormalities, which can be life-threatening. Dysautonomia has also been reported. The mechanism of cardiac damage in WD has not been elucidated. It may be the result of copper accumulation in the heart, and/or it could be due to a toxic effect of copper, resulting in the release of free oxygen radicals. Patients with signs and/or symptoms of cardiac involvement or who have cardiovascular risk factors should be examined by a cardiologist in addition to being assessed by their interdisciplinary treating team. Furthermore, ECG, cardiac biomarkers, echocardiography, and 24-hours or more of Holter monitoring at the diagnosis and/or during the follow-up of patients with WD need to be evaluated. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, although not always available, could also be a useful diagnostic tool, allowing assessment of the risk of ventricular arrhythmias and further guidance of the cardiac workup.

### Copper deficiency may be a leading cause of ischaemic heart disease [^117HVgUa]. Open Heart (2018). Low credibility.

Is copper deficiency common?

Plasma copper levels appear to be an inaccurate measure of copper status since ceruloplasmin is an acute-phase reactant that rises in illness and because plasma copper levels differ little between marginally copper-deficient and copper-sufficient subjects. Leucocyte copper may be the best measure of copper status, although this test is not commonly performed.

The RDA for copper is 0.9 mg/day for adults for both men and women. The tolerable upper intake level is much higher, at 10 mg/day for adults. In the 1980s, before a RDA was set, the suggested adequate intake range of copper was 2 to 3 mg/day, but was subsequently lowered when it appeared that few people reach this range without copper supplements. It appears that the decrease in recommended copper intake was largely based on only one study of 11 healthy men. Copper requirements may, however, vary widely depending on health status, pregnancy, age, sex and other factors. Some studies show a minimum requirement at 1.3 mg/d.

### Copper deficiency may be a leading cause of ischaemic heart disease [^11175iNJ]. Open Heart (2018). Low credibility.

Studies of copper supplementation have revealed that 62% of patients with moderate hypertension may be marginally copper deficient. Copper excretion increases during bedrest. Kidney disease, coeliac disease and bariatric surgery all increase the requirement for copper. The prevalence of these conditions in the population is high, and copper deficiency may masquerade as other conditions, such as myelodysplastic syndrome, and go unrecognised. The high consumption of fructose, a component of sucrose, that is, table sugar, induces copper deficiency in animals via impaired intestinal absorption. Since the average American consumes around 100 pounds of sugar annually, this may contribute to copper deficiency. Box 1 summarises the harms of copper deficiency. Table 1 summarises the benefits of copper supplementation in humans.

### Wilson's disease and cardiac myopathy [^115kmeuf]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

Wilson's disease is a well-characterized disorder known to cause liver and brain disease due to abnormal copper deposition. Data regarding copper infiltration of the heart is conflicting, and the risk of heart disease has not been well described. We aimed to determine whether Wilson's disease is associated with cardiac myopathy, clinically evident in the atria as atrial fibrillation (AF) and in the ventricles as heart failure (HF). We longitudinally assessed 14.3 million patients in the California Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project database from 2005 through 2009 for diagnoses of Wilson's disease, AF, HF, and covariates using International Classification of Diseases-9th Edition codes. Cirrhosis and appendicitis diagnoses were assessed for positive and negative validation, respectively. We identified 463 patients with Wilson's disease. As expected in validation analyses, patients with Wilson's disease had a threefold greater risk of cirrhosis (hazard ratio [HR] 2.85, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.81 to 2.90, p < 0.0001) and no increased risk of appendicitis (HR 0.24, 95% CI 0.04 to 1.71, p = 0.16). Patients with Wilson's disease exhibited a 29% higher risk of AF after adjusting for age, gender, race, income, hypertension, diabetes, renal disease, hyperlipidemia, obesity, coronary disease, and obstructive sleep apnea (HR 1.29, 95% CI 1.15 to 1.45, p < 0.0001). After adjusting for the same covariates, patients with Wilson's disease had a 55% higher risk of incident HF (HR 1.55, 95% CI 1.41 to 1.71, p < 0.0001). Patients with Wilson's disease have an increased risk of AF and HF, supporting the need for careful surveillance for heart disease. These findings also suggest that the role of copper metabolism in heart disease should be more broadly investigated.

### Copper chelation in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [^112CUVSm]. Open Heart (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In this small open-label pilot study in HCM, trientine was found to be safe and well tolerated. Treatment was associated with improvements in many pathophysiological features of HCM most importantly LVM. Indeed, an appropriately powered phase 2b double blinded, randomised multicentre study is now under way to answer whether trientine can slow or even halt HCM disease progression.

### Copper chelation in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [^114UDMYq]. Open Heart (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM), the most common monogenetic inherited cardiac disorder affecting 1 in every 500 of the population. It is characterised by left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy (LVH). Histologically, HCM displays myocyte enlargement and disarray, increased interstitial and replacement fibrosis and dysplastic intramyocardial arterioles.

Despite advances in diagnosis and risk stratification, there remains no licensed disease-modifying treatment for HCM. Indeed, since HCM was first described, there have been less than 50 pharmacological studies, enrolling less than 2500 patients. In 2010, a National Institutes of Health working group identified a ' critical need for future research considerations directed toward basic and translational studies to identify putative targets for intervention. When viable targets are identified, clinical studies should be undertaken to determine if novel (or currently available) drug, or other therapies, can target these pathways of HCM disease expression and, improve on the natural history of patients with this disease'".

Copper (Cu) is an essential cofactor for a variety of metabolic functions and while regulation of systemic Cu metabolism is critical to human health, free Cu ions are extremely redox-active and, thus, potentially toxic. Defective Cu metabolism is said to impair cardiovascular health in at least two known settings; chronic Cu deficiency and defective intracellular Cu transport to mitochondrial cytochrome-C oxidase. Cu excess is seen in Wilsons's disease and Chagas Cardiomyopathy, with both conditions being characterised by LVH, and indeed both mimicking HCM. Cu deficiency, on the other hand, has been linked to the development of various phenotypes of cardiomyopathy. Simplistically, one can summarise that disturbances of Cu homeostasis can lead to both dilated and hypertrophic forms of cardiomyopathy and that Cu chelation, in the absence of Cu deficiency, is may be able to reverse LVH and organ fibrosis via a Cu-dependent mechanism that reduces oxidative stress as demonstrated by us previously, both in animal and human studies.

### Micronutrient deficiencies in heart failure: mitochondrial dysfunction as a common pathophysiological mechanism? [^111RHo4v]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Copper

There are many copper‐dependent proteins (known as "cuproenzymes"), including transcriptional regulators, chaperones, oxidoreductases, free radical scavengers and immune function modulators. The adult body contains 50–120 mg of copper, mostly in muscle and the liver. Copper is absorbed in the intestine and released by the liver into bile to prevent copper toxicity. Copper is extremely toxic in excess as it can destabilize Fe/S clusters and increase the generation of free radicals. Mutations in ATP7A or ATP7B disrupt the homeostatic copper balance, resulting in inherited autosomal recessive disorders causing copper deficiency (Menkes disease) or copper overload (Wilson's disease), respectively. Copper deficiency can lead to problems with connective tissues, muscle weakness, anemia, low white blood cell count, immune dysfunction and neurological problems. According to an analysis of data from the 2009–2012 National Health and Nutrition Survey (NHANES), 6%–15% of adults have copper intake lower than recommended. However, copper deficiency is uncommon in humans except in special cases, such as individuals with celiac disease or older people with cachexia.

Intracellular copper deficiency increases lipoprotein peroxidation, impairs nitric oxide (NO)‐mediated endothelial dilatation and increases the risk of cardiomyocyte oxidative damage. In the mitochondria, copper is an essential component of complex IV, also known as Cytochrome C oxidase (CCO). Although copper is crucial for cytochrome oxidase function, the transporters and regulators of mitochondrial copper are unknown. In rats, a copper‐deficient diet caused a 74% decrease in CCO and increased manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) and GPX in isolated heart mitochondria. This is an indirect indication that mitochondrial ROS production was increased. Moreover, specifically cardiac mitochondrial ETC function was compromised in copper‐deficient rats. Additionally, a study in mice by Elsherif et al. showed that early life copper deficiency in mice leads to systolic and diastolic dysfunction in association with histopathological changes in the murine heart. The changes observed were suggested to show the transition from copper deficiency–induced hypertrophy to CHF.

### Heart is the most susceptible organ in an isogenic background to loss of function mutations in the mitochondrial metallochaperone SCO1 [^116C3Sna]. Human Molecular Genetics (2025). Medium credibility.

SCO1 is a nuclear-encoded protein with roles in cytochrome c oxidase (COX) assembly and the regulation of copper homeostasis. It remains unclear, however, why mutations in this ubiquitously expressed gene product cause distinct, tissue-specific forms of disease that primarily affect heart, liver or brain function. To gain a better understanding of the clinical heterogeneity observed across SCO1 pedigrees, we deleted Sco1 in the murine brain and observed a severe COX deficiency in the absence of altered tissue copper content that was tied to early, neonatal lethality. We therefore transitioned to whole body knockin mice expressing allelic variants of SCO1 that are pathogenic in humans to more accurately reflect the patient condition and avoid the lethality associated with tissue-specific Sco1 knockout. Sco1M277V mice exhibited the most severe COX deficiency in their brain, modeling the pathophysiological consequences of the p. Met294Val variant in humans and supporting the idea that the primary role of SCO1 in this tissue is to promote COX assembly. Phenotyping of Sco1G115S, Sco1P157L and Sco1M277V mice nonetheless emphasized that the heart generally displayed the most severe, combined COX and copper deficiency, with Sco1G115S and Sco1P157L hearts developing a dilated cardiomyopathy that was accompanied by significant depletion of their mitochondrial copper pool. Taken together, our findings suggest that in an isogenic context the heart is the most susceptible organ to loss of SCO1 function, and that single nucleotide polymorphisms at modifier loci in an outbred population likely contribute to the clinical heterogeneity observed across SCO1 pedigrees.

### Cardiac copper deficiency activates a systemic signaling mechanism that communicates with the copper acquisition and storage organs [^115h4Stg]. Cell Metabolism (2010). Low credibility.

Copper (Cu) is an essential cofactor for a variety of metabolic functions, and the regulation of systemic Cu metabolism is critical to human health. Dietary Cu is absorbed through the intestine, stored in the liver, and mobilized into the circulation; however, systemic Cu homeostasis is poorly understood. We generated mice with a cardiac-specific knockout of the Ctr1 Cu transporter (Ctr1(hrt/hrt)), resulting in cardiac Cu deficiency and severe cardiomyopathy. Unexpectedly, Ctr1(hrt/hrt) mice exhibited increased serum Cu levels and a concomitant decrease in hepatic Cu stores. Expression of the ATP7A Cu exporter, thought to function predominantly in intestinal Cu acquisition, was strongly increased in liver and intestine of Ctr1(hrt/hrt) mice. These studies identify ATP7A as a candidate for hepatic Cu mobilization in response to peripheral tissue demand, and illuminate a systemic regulation in which the Cu status of the heart is signaled to organs that take up and store Cu.

### Iron-overload cardiomyopathy: pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment [^116RZEYT]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2010). Low credibility.

Background

The prevalence of primary (hereditary) hemochromatosis and secondary iron overload (hemosiderosis) is reaching epidemic levels worldwide. Iron-overload leads to excessive iron deposition in a wide variety of tissues, including the heart and endocrine tissues.

Methods and Results

Iron-overload cardiomyopathy is the primary determinant of survival in patients with secondary iron overload, while also being a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with primary hemochromatosis. Iron-induced cardiovascular injury also occurs in acute iron toxicosis (iron poisoning), myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury, cardiomyopathy associated with Friedreich ataxia, and vascular dysfunction. The mainstay therapies for iron overload associated with primary hemochromatosis and secondary iron overload is phlebotomy and iron chelation therapy, respectively. L-type Ca(2+) channels provide a high-capacity pathway for ferrous (Fe(2+)) uptake into cardiomyocytes in iron-overload conditions; calcium channel blockers may represent a new therapeutic tool to reduce the toxic effects of excess iron.

Conclusions

Iron-overload cardiomyopathy is a an important and potentially reversible cause of heart failure at an international scale and involves diastolic dysfunction, increased susceptibility to arrhythmias and a late-stage dilated cardiomyopathy. The early diagnosis of iron-overload cardiomyopathy is critical since the cardiac dysfunction is reversible if effective therapy is introduced before the onset of overt heart failure.

### Copper chelation in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [^1166oPQo]. Open Heart (2022). Medium credibility.

Copper is an essential trace element found in all body tissues and has an important role in multiple biological functions, including signalling pathways, cellular respiration and as a cofactor for enzymatic activity. Within the human body, copper is found in its reduced state, Cu + and its oxidised state, Cu 2+. Cu 2+ ions are the most highly redox-active metal ions in mammals, and as such are powerful catalysts of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidative stress. Excess tissue Cu 2+ ions lead to tissue damage by catalysing the formation of damaging hydroxyl (OH ∙) radicals via the Fenton reaction. Furthermore, Cu 2+ ions activate the transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 signalling pathway, inhibit enzymatic antioxidants such as extracellular superoxide dismutase and augment the cardiotoxic effects of catecholamines. Experimentally, ROS are associated with myocardial hypertrophy, injury, apoptosis, necrosis and fibrosis. Furthermore, increased oxidative stress occurs in various models of LV pressure load and potentially perpetuates LVH, whereby cyclic strain causes an amplitude-related increase in ROS, associated with differential activation of kinases and induction of hypertrophic and apoptotic phenotypes.

Recent research has highlighted the potential role of oxidative stress and low-grade inflammation in HCM pathophysiology. Dimitrow et al. found serum levels of 8-iso-prostaglandin F2α (8-iso-PGF2α), a biomarker of generalised cellular oxidative stress, were elevated in 54 patients with HCM compared with matched controls. Patients with LVOT obstruction displayed higher 8-iso-PGF2a levels than those without LVOT obstruction. In a preclinical HCM study, N-acetylcysteine restored oxidised to total glutathione ratio, normalised levels of glutathiolated cardiac alpha-actin, restored myocardial levels of active protein kinase G and dephosphorylated nuclear factor of activated T cells 1 and phospho-p38, reversed cardiac and myocyte hypertrophy and interstitial fibrosis, reduced the propensity for ventricular arrhythmias and prevented cardiac dysfunction, although a recent clinical trial of N-acetylcysteine in HCM was disappointing, although with a small sample size. In a transgenic model of human HCM, Senthil et al found atorvastatin reduced LVM, wall thickness, myocyte size, myocardial levels of molecular markers of hypertrophy, lipid peroxides and oxidised mitochondrial DNA.

### Copper deficiency may be a leading cause of ischaemic heart disease [^116Bkskh]. Open Heart (2018). Low credibility.

Copper and myocardial tissue

Copper deficiency in rodents leads to cardiac hypertrophy and to heart failure. Copper repletion leads to a rapid regression of cardiac hypertrophy and prevention of heart failure. Copper deficiency results in changes in myocardial gene expression, including upregulating inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha. Other changes in gene expression involved factors that regulate cardiac contractility, calcium cycling and fibrosis, all of which might be the cause of altered cardiac function in copper-deficient mice. Additionally, copper deficiency reduces ATP synthase function, which may be the leading mechanism for inducing cardiac hypertrophy. Copper repletion reverses these changes in heart tissue and may be the result of changes in gene expression in myocardial tissue. In copper depletion, lipid is deposited in myocardial tissue, along with swelling of mitochondria, cardiac hypertrophy and blunted response to a beta-adrenergic agonist, isoproterenol. Copper repletion reversed these changes, indicating that copper deficiency is an appealing target in cardiomyopathy. In a patient with mutations in Sco2, a copper-transport protein that delivers copper to CCO, copper-histidine resolves severe hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

### Diabetic cardiomyopathy is associated with defective myocellular copper regulation and both defects are rectified by divalent copper chelation [^115G5F25]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of disability and death in patients with diabetes mellitus, in whom it is frequently accompanied by impaired LV function and heart failure. Hyperglycemia is a major factor for the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) which contributes substantially to morbidity and mortality. DCM causes numerous pathological changes, for example myocellular hypertrophy, interstitial fibrosis and defective fuel utilization, accompanied by damage to myocellular organelles including the plasma membrane, contractile apparatus, mitochondria, and sarcoplasmic reticulum: these defects cooperate to cause impaired systolic and diastolic function and frequently progress to overt heart failure. The molecular mechanisms by which these defects occur are poorly understood and currently there is no directly effective treatment for DCM.

Pathogenetic mechanisms that cause tissue damage in diabetes may reflect molecular defects that lead to increased cellular production of superoxide anion (O 2 ●-) in affected tissues: examples are excessive O 2 ●- production through mitochondrial dysfunction coupled with diminished O 2 ●- clearance through impaired SOD activity (reviewed in). In addition, alterations in ion homeostasis have also been implicated in the pathogenesis of DCM. For example, decreased myocellular Ca 2+ efflux through the Na + -Ca 2+ exchanger (NCX) and Ca 2+ -ATPase (SERCA) pump systems, has been linked to defects in cardiac energy metabolism and contractile function; however, impaired calcium homeostasis may not explain the contractile deficit in DCM. Altered myocellular [K +] IC and [Na +] IC may also contribute to the impaired cardiac function and energy-inefficient metabolism in DCM.

### Cardiac involvement in Wilson disease [^114yDofp]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Wilson disease is an inherited autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism resulting in pathological accumulation of copper in the liver, brain and other tissues. One of the reported manifestations is cardiac involvement.

Methods

We studied 42 patients with Wilson disease (19 men and 23 women, mean age 34 ± 10 y) and 42 age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers. All subjects underwent complete echocardiographic examination; 24 h ECG Holter monitoring was performed in 23 Wilson disease patients.

Results

In comparison to healthy subjects, patients with Wilson disease had increased thickness of the interventricular septum (9.5 ± 1.4 vs 8.6 ± 1.1 mm, p < 0.01) and left ventriclular (LV) posterior wall (9.1 ± 1.3 vs 8.2 ± 1.0 mm, p < 0.01). While the two groups did not differ in LV mass index, relative LV wall thickness was significantly increased in Wilson disease patients compared to control subjects (0.39 ± 0.06 vs 0.34 ± 0.04 p < 0.001). Concentric LV remodelling was present in 9 patients (21%) and LV hypertrophy in one patient. Systolic LV function showed a nonsignificant trend towards lower values in Wilson disease patients (EF 62 ± 5% vs 64 ± 50%, p = 0.06). Diastolic filling and the frequency of valvular abnormalities were comparable in both groups. The established echocardiographic abnormalities did not correlate with the type of Wilson disease manifestation, the presence of the His1069Gln mutation, laboratory parameters or the duration and type of therapy. Twenty-four-hour ECG Holter monitoring detected ECG abnormalities in 10 patients (42%), the most frequent findings being runs of supraventricular tachycardias and frequent supraventricular ectopic beats.

Conclusions

Cardiac involvement in Wilson disease patients was mild, characterized by LV parietal thickening with an increased prevalence of concentric LV remodelling and a relatively high frequency of benign supraventricular tachycardias and extrasystolic beats.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Technetium Tc99m Sestamibi is a cationic Tc99m complex which has been found to accumulate in viable myocardial tissue in a manner analogous to that of thallous chloride Tl-201. Scintigraphic images obtained in humans after the intravenous administration of the drug have been comparable to those obtained with thallous chloride Tl-201 in normal and abnormal myocardial tissue.

Animal studies have shown that myocardial uptake is not blocked when the sodium pump mechanism is inhibited. Although studies of subcellular fractionation and electron micrographic analysis of heart cell aggregates suggest that Tc99m Sestamibi cellular retention occurs specifically within the mitochondria as a result of electrostatic interactions, the clinical relevance of these findings has not been determined.

The mechanism of Tc99m Sestamibi localization in various types of breast tissue (e.g., benign, inflammatory, malignant, fibrous) has not been established.

### Myocardial involvement characteristics by cardiac MR imaging in neurological and non-neurological Wilson disease patients [^114NG6FV]. Insights Into Imaging (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Wilson disease (WD) is a genetic disorder of copper metabolism caused by variants in the ATP7B gene. Globally, the prevalence of the disease gene is 1 in every 90 individuals, and the occurrence of the disease ranges from approximately 0.25/10,000 to 4/10,000. Copper overload mainly occurs in the liver and brain and causes a variety of liver damage and neurological symptoms. Patients can be divided into WD-neuro + (patients with at least one neurological symptom) and WD-neuro − (patients with a primarily hepatic involvement) patients. However, several studies have shown that copper deposition can also occur in the heart and lead to clinical symptoms of related cardiovascular disease (e.g. arrhythmias, atrial fibrillation, heart failure, etc.). Therefore, early detection of myocardial involvement is important even in asymptomatic WD patients. Electrocardiogram and echocardiography are the most commonly used cardiac examination to evaluate WD. However, their ability to detect alteration in myocardial microstructure and function is limited, and the absence of distinctive characteristics poses a challenge in recognizing myocardial damage caused by WD. Endomyocardial biopsy is the gold standard for the diagnosis of many primary and secondary cardiac conditions. Unfortunately, it is difficult to be widely carried out in clinical work because it is an invasive method and has the risk of complications. Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging has become a non-invasive and reliable tool for detecting and diagnosing myocardial involvement in a variety of diseases. CMR provides comprehensive evaluation of cardiac morphology, function, and myocardial fibrosis by CMR-T1 mapping, T2 mapping, and late gadolinium enhancement (LGE). Previous study had shown that in German cohorts, WD-neuro + patients exhibit more adverse cardiac remodeling and dysfunction compared to WD-neuro − patients. However, the characteristics of myocardial involvement in WD patients among Asian populations remain unclear.

We aimed (1) to evaluate the segmental involvement characteristics of myocardium in WD patients using CMR and (2) to compare the differences between WD-neuro + and WD-neuro − patients.

### Copper chelation in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [^1119cycc]. Open Heart (2022). Medium credibility.

In a prospective observational cohort study of 20 HCM patients and 18 matched healthy volunteers, we found that HCM was associated with significantly elevated serum copper and caeruloplasmin.

Trientine dihydrochloride is a copper-chelating agent licensed for Wilson disease. In a randomised placebocontrolled trial in patients with type II diabetes and LVH, trientine was associated with a significant reduction in LV mass (LVM) without changes in blood pressure (BP) or glucose. Cumulative urine copper excretion was independently associated with the observed decrease in LVM.

In the present study, we aimed to explore the safety, tolerability and efficacy of trientine dihydrochloride in patients with HCM.

### Copper deficiency may be a leading cause of ischaemic heart disease [^11639VdJ]. Open Heart (2018). Low credibility.

Antioxidant enzymes

Superoxide dismutase (SOD) is an antioxidant enzyme and is copper dependent. It catalyses the dismutation of the damaging superoxide radical (O 2 −) to molecular oxygen or hydrogen peroxide, the latter of which is in turn reduced to water by other enzymes. There are two types of SOD that use copper as a co-factor: (1) Cu/Zn SOD, found in most animal cells; and (2) extracellular SOD, found in high levels in the lungs and in lesser amounts in plasma.

Of importance to IHD, superoxide radicals react with nitric oxide (NO) to produce the highly toxic molecule peroxynitrite, which contributes to oxidative and nitrosative damage.NO acts to regulate endothelial function and is therefore important to vascular integrity. Copper deficiency, by reducing levels of SOD, can lead to reductions in NO, which in turn leads to reduced endothelial function, lower vasodilation and increased oxidative stress, all of these being hallmarks of atherosclerosis. Copper deficiency also reduces liver and plasma selenoglutathione peroxidase.

Drug-associated atrioventricular block — therapy interactions and risk management are described as follows: Beta blockers have been recommended as guideline-directed medical therapy for heart failure and after myocardial infarction (MI), but atrioventricular block was usually an exclusion criterion in the large trials showing benefit. Atrioventricular block can develop secondary to amiodarone or sotalol used for atrial fibrillation (AF), and the benefit of any medication that exacerbates atrioventricular block must be balanced against potentially deleterious effects of right ventricular pacing.

### Diabetic cardiomyopathy is associated with defective myocellular copper regulation and both defects are rectified by divalent copper chelation [^111fpkvU]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2014). Low credibility.

Both copper deficiency and copper excess states can cause elevated oxidative stress and impaired antioxidant defenses. Copper deficiency can cause neurodegeneration, and hematological and cardiovascular disorders, whereas copper overload may be accompanied by hepatic and neurological diseases. Copper homeostasis is coordinated by several regulatory protein chaperones, through which it is delivered to specific subcellular compartments and/or copper-requiring proteins without releasing free copper atoms that could otherwise damage cells and tissues: examples include the copper chaperone for superoxide dismutase (CCS) for SOD1, and the antioxidant 1 copper chaperone (ATOX1) for ATP7A and ATP7B. Disturbances in copper homeostasis have pronounced deleterious effects on many bodily functions, such as those observed in Menkes' or Wilson's diseases, which are caused by mutations in the genes encoding ATP7A and ATP7B respectively. In addition, copper is a key cofactor for many important enzymes such as Cu/Zn-SOD (SOD1), EC-SOD (SOD3), cytochrome c oxidase (COX), and ceruloplasmin/ferroxidase, whereof deficient activities have been implicated in the causation of several disease states. It has also been shown that localized myocardial copper deficiency, caused by the heart-specific knockout of Ctr1 in mice, causes severe cardiomyopathy, as do genetically-mediated defects in humans and rodents of the SCO2 gene, which encodes a chaperone protein necessary for copper metalation of the CuA site on the COII subunit of COX. These observations provide key evidence linking myocardial copper deficiency and impaired copper metalation to the causation of cardiomyopathy.

Other organ involvement in Wilson disease (WD) — renal, skeletal, cardiac, and endocrine features: Important extrahepatic manifestations apart from neurological or psychiatric disease may be present at time of diagnosis of WD, with cardiac and bony abnormalities present initially or becoming evident later. Renal abnormalities have been characterized as a Fanconi syndrome (aminoaciduria, phosphaturia, microscopic hematuria, and defective urinary acidification), with reports of recurrent muscle weakness due to hypokalemia associated with incomplete proximal renal tubular acidosis as a presenting feature; hypouricemia and nephrolithiasis may also be presenting features. Some patients, notably in the Indo-Pakistani subcontinent, have prominent skeletal abnormalities at presentation resembling rickets with demineralization; this "osseomuscular" WD is uncommon but distinctive, and a recent meta-analysis showed a trend toward increased risk of osteopenia and osteoporosis in WD. Cardiac problems include cardiomyopathy and arrhythmias, with atrial fibrillation more common in patients with WD than in the general population; left ventricular hypertrophy may occur, cardiac abnormalities can present in childhood, and dysautonomia with inappropriate cardiovascular responses or dysrhythmia has been described. Endocrine abnormalities include hypoparathyroidism and infertility or repeated miscarriages, and pancreatitis at clinical presentation was attributed to copper deposition in the pancreas.

Biochemistry and haemodynamic data

There was no change in serum copper or zinc after 6 months of trientine. There was a small but statistically significant increase in serum caeruloplasmin.

Compliance with 24-hour urinary copper collection was poor, particularly at the end of study visit (visit 6). Analysis was, therefore, conducted using data collected at visit 5 (150 days of treatment). Urinary copper increased significantly from baseline to visit 5 (0.42 ± 0.2 vs 2.02 ± 1.0 µmol/L/24 hours, p = 0.001). Patients could continue in the study despite poor compliance with the 24-hour urine collections as change in urinary copper was not a primary outcome measure.

There were no clinically relevant changes in BP, heart rate or body surface area with trientine (table 2).

LVM and volumetrics

Six months of trientine was associated with a strong trend towards a decrease in LVM. Indeed, in comparison to the observational control group, LVM decreased significantly (−4.1 ± 8.0 g vs 2.7 ± 4.4 g, p = 0.03) (see online supplemental figure 2 in the supplementary data). No change was observed in LV volumetrics (table 3).

Intrauterine device eligibility — cardiovascular conditions: For ischemic heart disease and prior stroke, a theoretical concern exists about the effect of levonorgestrel (LNG) on lipids, and use of copper intrauterine devices (Cu-IUDs) has no restrictions. For valvular heart disease, prophylactic antibiotics solely to prevent endocarditis are not recommended for genitourinary tract procedures, including placement or removal of IUDs. For peripartum cardiomyopathy, no direct evidence exists on the safety of IUDs and limited indirect evidence from noncomparative studies did not demonstrate any cases of arrhythmia or infective endocarditis in women with cardiac disease who used IUDs; additionally, IUD placement might induce cardiac arrhythmias in healthy persons and persons with peripartum cardiomyopathy have a high incidence of cardiac arrhythmias.

Secondary endpoints

Secondary endpoints are shown in Table 2 and cumulative incidences are graphically illustrated in Figure 4. After a median follow-up of 10.0 years (IQR 5.8–14.6), the cumulative incidence of death from any cause was 8.6% (95% CI 6.2–11.5%) in the AVB population compared with 2.4% (95% CI 1.9–2.9%) in controls (adjusted HR 2.2; 95% CI 1.5–3.2%). Cardiovascular deaths comprised 3.5% (95% CI 2.1–5.5%) in the AVB population and 0.2% (95% CI 0.1–0.4%) in the general population [median follow-up 10.0 (IQR 5.8–14.6) years] (adjusted HR 11.7; 95% CI 5.7–23.3). Heart failure hospitalization was observed in 7.7% (95% CI 5.4–10.4%) in the AVB population compared with 0.7% (95% CI 0.5–1.0%) in the general population [median follow-up 9.9 (IQR 5.7–14.5) years] (adjusted HR 8.6; 95% CI 5.4–13.8). When comparing patients with intermittent AVB with the corresponding controls, we found an HR of 8.0 (95% CI 4.9–13.0; P < 0.001) of heart failure hospitalization. When comparing patients with persistent AVB with their controls, we found an HR of 15.5 (95% CI 6.9–35.0; P < 0.001) of heart failure hospitalization (Supplementary material online, Figure S1). However, there was no statistically significant difference between the two HRs (P = 0.24).

### Current diagnostic and treatment strategies for specific dilated cardiomyopathies: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^113CLG4W]. Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Iron-overload cardiomyopathy — diagnosis and initial management begin with serological testing, where serum transferrin saturation (serum iron/total iron binding capacity of > 45%) and elevated serum ferritin > 200 µg/L in men or > 150 µg/L in women supports the diagnosis; if HH is suspected, especially with a known family history, testing for the HH genotype should be performed. Diagnosis of cardiac iron overload is possible with cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), in which a decreased T2 signal correlates with myocardial iron infiltration and depressed left ventricular function. The established treatment for HH is phlebotomy, and in secondary iron overload, there is a role for chelation therapy.

### Rationale and design of a randomised trial of trientine in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [^113LQKNH]. Heart (2023). Medium credibility.

Aims

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is characterised by left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), myocardial fibrosis, enhanced oxidative stress and energy depletion. Unbound/loosely bound tissue copper II ions are powerful catalysts of oxidative stress and inhibitors of antioxidants. Trientine is a highly selective copper II chelator. In preclinical and clinical studies in diabetes, trientine is associated with reduced LVH and fibrosis, and improved mitochondrial function and energy metabolism. Trientine was associated with improvements in cardiac structure and function in an open-label study in patients with HCM.

Methods

The Efficacy and Mechanism of Trientine in Patients with Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (TEMPEST) trial is a multicentre, double-blind, parallel group, 1:1 randomised, placebo-controlled phase II trial designed to evaluate the efficacy and mechanism of action of trientine in patients with HCM. Patients with a diagnosis of HCM according to the European Society of Cardiology Guidelines and in New York Heart Association classes I-III are randomised to trientine or matching placebo for 52 weeks. Primary outcome is change in left ventricular (LV) mass indexed to body surface area, measured using cardiovascular magnetic resonance. Secondary efficacy objectives will determine whether trientine improves exercise capacity, reduces arrhythmia burden, reduces cardiomyocyte injury, improves LV and atrial function, and reduces LV outflow tract gradient. Mechanistic objectives will determine whether the effects are mediated by cellular or extracellular mass regression and improved myocardial energetics.

Conclusion

TEMPEST will determine the efficacy and mechanism of action of trientine in patients with HCM.

Effective chelation therapy can prevent or reverse organ toxicity related to iron overload, yet cardiac complications and premature death continue to occur, largely related to difficulties with compliance in patients who receive parenteral therapy. The use of oral chelators may be able to overcome these difficulties and improve patient outcomes. A chelator's efficacy at cardiac and liver iron removal and side-effect profile should be considered when tailoring individual chelation regimens. Broader options for chelation therapy, including possible combination therapy, should improve clinical efficacy and enhance patient care.

ST-segment and T-wave repolarization abnormalities — primary versus secondary definitions — are delineated as follows: Primary repolarization abnormalities are the result of changes in the shape and/or duration of the repolarization phases of the transmembrane action potential and occur without changes in depolarization; they may be localized or diffuse and may be caused by ischemia, myocarditis, drugs, toxins, electrolyte abnormalities including serum calcium and potassium, and an abrupt change in heart rate, hyperventilation, changes in body position, catecholamines, sympathetic stimulation or ablation of the stellate ganglion, and temperature changes. Secondary repolarization abnormalities directly reflect changes in the sequence and/or duration of ventricular depolarization, manifested electrocardiographically as changes in QRS shape and/or duration, with examples including bundle-branch blocks, ventricular preexcitation, and ectopic and paced ventricular complexes.

### Ponesimod (Ponvory) [^111sEr8f]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Treatment Initiation Recommendations

Obtain an ECG in all patients to determine whether preexisting conduction abnormalities are present.
In all patients, a dose titration is recommended for initiation of PONVORY treatment to help reduce cardiac effects [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].
In patients with sinus bradycardia, first-or second-degree [Mobitz type I] AV block, or a history of myocardial infarction or heart failure with onset more than 6 months prior to initiation, first-dose monitoring is recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.3)].
PONVORY is not recommended in patients with a history of cardiac arrest, cerebrovascular disease (e.g. TIA, stroke occurring more than 6 months prior to treatment initiation), uncontrolled hypertension, or severe untreated sleep apnea, since significant bradycardia may be poorly tolerated in these patients. If treatment is considered, advice from a cardiologist should be sought prior to initiation of treatment in order to determine the most appropriate monitoring strategy.
Use of PONVORY in patients with a history of recurrent syncope or symptomatic bradycardia should be based on an overall benefit-risk assessment. If treatment is considered, advice from a cardiologist should be sought prior to initiation of treatment in order to determine the most appropriate monitoring.
Experience with PONVORY is limited in patients receiving concurrent therapy with drugs that decrease heart rate (e.g., beta-blockers, non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers - diltiazem and verapamil, and other drugs that may decrease heart rate such as digoxin). Concomitant use of these drugs during PONVORY initiation may be associated with severe bradycardia and heart block. If treatment is considered, advice from a cardiologist should be sought prior to initiation of treatment in order to determine the most appropriate monitoring.
For patients receiving a stable dose of a beta-blocker, the resting heart rate should be considered before introducing PONVORY treatment. If the resting heart rate is greater than 55 bpm under chronic beta-blocker treatment, PONVORY can be introduced. If resting heart rate is less than or equal to 55 bpm, beta-blocker treatment should be interrupted until the baseline heart rate is greater than 55 bpm. Treatment with PONVORY can then be initiated and treatment with a beta-blocker can be reinitiated after PONVORY has been up-titrated to the target maintenance dosage [see Drug Interactions (7.3)].
For patients taking other drugs that decrease heart rate, treatment with PONVORY should generally not be initiated without consultation from a cardiologist because of the potential additive effect on heart rate [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Drug Interactions (7.2)].

### Copper deficiency may be a leading cause of ischaemic heart disease [^116CUNSP]. Open Heart (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

The burden of ischaemic heart disease (IHD) continues to grow in the developed world with a greater fraction of the population composed of older people. In the United States, heart disease is the leading cause of death overall and in those over 65 years of age. The most accepted theory for the cause of IHD remains high total or elevated LDL cholesterol, which in turn is due to a high intake of dietary saturated fat; yet this theory has come under increasing scrutiny in recent years. Indeed, recent meta-analyses have found no relation between dietary saturated fat consumption and the incidence of IHD.

We may have been looking in the wrong places in our attempts to discern the cause(s) of IHD. Copper is an essential trace element that has been an overlooked factor in IHD. Numerous animal and human studies have demonstrated that copper deficiency can cause IHD and that copper supplementation or adequate dietary copper can improve many of the risk factors for IHD. Copper deficiency could be driving much of the current burden of IHD in the population. Copper intakes have been declining and it appears that a large fraction of the population does not even consume the recommended daily allowance (RDA) for copper(0.9 mg per day) let alone an optimal intake of copper (2.6 mg per day). Thus, it appears that much of the population is at risk of inadequate but especially suboptimal intakes of copper.

Copper is involved in numerous biological processes, and its insufficiency or deficiency can to lead to many of the risks or manifestations of IHD, as we discuss below.

Biological properties of copper

Copper is involved in the functions of many copper-dependent proteins, including transcriptional regulators, chaperones, oxidoreductases, mitochondrial electron transport and free radical scavenging. Copper is also important for immune function. Low dietary copper intake reduces immune response, which is not restored to normal levels even after several weeks of a high copper intake.

In relation to IHD, the heart is one of the main organs affected by copper deficiency, causing a reduction in metabolism and energy supply in the heart. Insufficient dietary copper can produce almost every risk factor for IHD. There are many important similarities between copper deficiency in animals and IHD in humans, including glucose intolerance, hypercholesterolemia, abnormal ECG, hyperuricemia and hypertension, all of which are risk factors for IHD. Much of the lipid hypothesis of heart disease can be seen in the light of copper deficiency.

### Diabetic cardiomyopathy is associated with defective myocellular copper regulation and both defects are rectified by divalent copper chelation [^111QUNUx]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

Here we report that a marked deficiency in total copper, of ~50%, occurred in the LV myocardium of diabetic rats with DCM and, strikingly, that there was full restoration of copper to control levels following treatment with the Cu (II)-selective chelator, TETA. We also demonstrate that TETA-mediated restoration of LV copper was accompanied by marked improvement in the structural and functional defects in the LV of rats with DCM, consistent with prior reports. TETA treatment with the dosage used for the current protocol did not have any adverse effects on cardiac function in non-diabetic control LV, although long-term treatment with higher dosages could be expected to cause symptomatic copper deficiency. We also identified several myocellular copper proteins that respond to TETA treatment in diabetes, but TETA treatment in non-diabetic controls did not alter expression of copper transporters CTR1 and CTR2. Therefore TETA treatment at the dosage employed does not affect copper transport, and further data from TETA-treated non-diabetic controls are not required for interpretation of results of the current study. One question that then arises from these data is that of how copper-chelation successfully ameliorates LV copper deficiency in diabetes?

Physiological copper exists in the body in two valence states, Cu (I) which is mainly localized in the intracellular compartment and comprises ~95% of total body-copper, and Cu (II), which is largely present in the extracellular space and comprises the remaining ~5%. We report here that diabetic rats have lower myocardial copper, a result mainly of decreased intracellular Cu (I), whereas we have shown previously that chelatable extracellular cardiac Cu (II) is increased by ~3-fold in diabetic rats. These results support the hypothesis that the copper-deficient state in the diabetic LV-myocardium is associated with insufficient [Cu (I)] IC but excessive [Cu (II)] EC: that is, it reflects an imbalanced distribution of myocardial copper consistent with defective copper uptake into the LV. Heart failure in diabetes may thus be explained, at least in part, by disruption of the distribution of the two copper valence states, and the concomitant myocardial damage that ensues.

### The mitochondrial metallochaperone SCO1 maintains CTR1 at the plasma membrane to preserve copper homeostasis in the murine heart [^1167zXGK]. Human Molecular Genetics (2017). Low credibility.

SCO1 is a ubiquitously expressed, mitochondrial protein with essential roles in cytochrome c oxidase (COX) assembly and the regulation of copper homeostasis. SCO1 patients present with severe forms of early onset disease, and ultimately succumb from liver, heart or brain failure. However, the inherent susceptibility of these tissues to SCO1 mutations and the clinical heterogeneity observed across SCO1 pedigrees remain poorly understood phenomena. To further address this issue, we generated Sco1hrt/hrt and Sco1stm/stm mice in which Sco1 was specifically deleted in heart and striated muscle, respectively. Lethality was observed in both models due to a combined COX and copper deficiency that resulted in a dilated cardiomyopathy. Left ventricular dilation and loss of heart function was preceded by a temporal decrease in COX activity and copper levels in the longer-lived Sco1stm/stm mice. Interestingly, the reduction in copper content of Sco1stm/stm cardiomyocytes was due to the mislocalisation of CTR1, the high affinity transporter that imports copper into the cell. CTR1 was similarly mislocalized to the cytosol in the heart of knockin mice carrying a homozygous G115S substitution in Sco1, which in humans causes a hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Our current findings in the heart are in marked contrast to our prior observations in the liver, where Sco1 deletion results in a near complete absence of CTR1 protein. These data collectively argue that mutations perturbing SCO1 function have tissue-specific consequences for the machinery that ultimately governs copper homeostasis, and further establish the importance of aberrant mitochondrial signaling to the etiology of copper handling disorders.

Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Recommendations — acute management of reversible causes of bradycardia attributable to atrioventricular (AV) block: Patients with transient or reversible causes of AV block should have medical therapy and supportive care, including temporary transvenous pacing if necessary, before determination of need for permanent pacing. In selected patients with symptomatic second-degree or third-degree AV block on chronic stable doses of medically necessary antiarrhythmic or beta-blocker therapy, it is reasonable to proceed to permanent pacing without further observation for drug washout or reversibility. In patients with second-degree or third-degree AV block associated with cardiac sarcoidosis, permanent pacing with additional defibrillator capability if needed and meaningful survival of greater than 1 year is expected, without further observation for reversibility is reasonable. In patients with symptomatic second-degree or third-degree AV block associated with thyroid function abnormalities but without clinical myxedema, permanent pacing without further observation for reversibility may be considered.

### Copper deficiency may be a leading cause of ischaemic heart disease [^113mnAjX]. Open Heart (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

Copper deficiency creates or impacts virtually every risk factor of IHD, such as hypercholesterolemia and glucose tolerance, and can increase chronic inflammation and oxidative stress, which are also thought to be important factors in cardiovascular disease risk. Substantial evidence exists to show that marginal copper deficiency is common, which leads to the notion that insufficient copper levels, caused or exacerbated by insufficient dietary copper, may be involved in the promotion of IHD. Insufficient body levels of copper may promote LDL oxidation, lower levels of crucial antioxidant enzymes, poorly functioning mitochondria and adverse changes to blood vessels, all of which may contribute to the genesis of IHD. Substantial human epidemiological evidence links copper deficiency with increased risk of IHD. Copper insufficiency is linked to NAFLD and the metabolic syndrome, and patients with these conditions are at higher risk of IHD. The major IHD risk, advancing age, may be linked with mitochondrial insufficiency, which is known to occur in ageing and which is also linked to low copper levels, which damage mitochondria. Copper supplementation in humans leads to lower levels of markers of oxidative stress, as well as to lower levels of PAI-1, an important risk factor for IHD. With reductions in copper levels in nearly all foods over the last several decades along with widespread adoption of ultra-processed food, low average copper consumption and extensive subclinical insufficiency or deficiency of copper may be more common than once thought.

While research and medical practice has focused almost exclusively on cholesterol and dietary saturated fat as IHD risk factors, we may have overlooked an exceedingly simple, plausible and widespread condition, copper deficiency, as one cause, perhaps even a major cause, of IHD. Increasing consumption of ultra-processed food, as well as a general avoidance of copper-rich foods, may play a role in widespread copper insufficiency and deficiency and therefore may be linked to IHD via copper. Copper in the diet or as supplementation has low toxicity, and an increased consumption of copper has the potential to reduce the population-wide incidence of IHD, heart failure and fatty liver disease. Copper deficiency as a link to increased risk of IHD deserves more attention from both clinicians and researchers.

Medication-related atrioventricular block — beta blockers have been recommended as guideline-directed medical therapy for heart failure and after MI, but atrioventricular block was usually an exclusion criterion for large trials showing benefit; atrioventricular block can develop secondary to drugs such as amiodarone or sotalol used for AF, and the benefit of any medication that exacerbates atrioventricular block must be balanced with potentially deleterious effects of right ventricular pacing.

### Cupric chloride (Copper) [^116kYxYx]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

OVERDOSAGE

Acute copper toxicity has been reported in patients with oral, intravenous, or subcutaneous administration. Clinical manifestations included metallic taste, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, neurological signs, such as encephalopathy, and multi-organ failure involving kidney, liver, blood, and cardiovascular systems, which may be fatal. Chelating agents, such as D-penicillamine, can be used for treatment of acute toxicity. Long-term administration of parenteral copper above the recommended dosage may result in significant accumulation of copper in the liver, brain, and other tissues with possible organ damage (see WARNINGS: Hepatic Accumulation).

8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS

Lactation: Advise patients to interrupt breastfeeding for 12 hours after Detectnet administration. (8.2)

8.1 Pregnancy

Risk Summary

All radiopharmaceuticals, including Detectnet have the potential to cause fetal harm depending on the fetal stage of development and the magnitude of the radiation dose. Advise a pregnant woman of the potential risks of fetal exposure to radiation from administration of Detectnet.

There are no data on Detectnet use in pregnant women to evaluate for a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. No animal reproduction studies have been conducted with copper Cu 64 dotatate injection.

The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defects, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

There are no data on the presence of copper Cu 64 dotatate in human milk, the effect on the breastfed infant, or the effect on milk production. Lactation studies have not been conducted in animals.

Advise a lactating woman to interrupt breastfeeding for 12 hours after Detectnet administration in order to minimize radiation exposure to a breastfed infant.

8.4 Pediatric Use

The safety and effectiveness of Detectnet have not been established in pediatric patients.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Clinical studies of Detectnet did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.

### AHA / ACCF / HRS recommendations for the standardization and interpretation of the electrocardiogram: part IV: the ST segment, T and U waves, and the QT interval: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association electrocardiography and arrhythmias committee, council on clinical cardiology; the American college of cardiology foundation; and the Heart Rhythm Society: endorsed by the international society for computerized electrocardiology [^111ZfAGp]. Circulation (2009). Medium credibility.

Secondary repolarization abnormalities — recognition and vector relationships — are characterized by directions opposite to depolarization vectors: In left bundle-branch block, the ST-segment and T-wave vectors are generally directed opposite to the mean QRS vector; in right bundle-branch block they are directed opposite to the slow terminal component of the QRS complex; and in ventricular preexcitation, ST-T changes are directed opposite to the delta wave of the QRS complex. When the direction of the QRS axis is normal, an abnormal direction of the T-wave axis is generally an indication of primary repolarization abnormalities. The practical utility of the ventricular gradient in differentiating primary from secondary repolarization abnormalities has not been demonstrated. With transiently altered ventricular conduction from ectopic ventricular complexes or transient bundle-branch blocks, secondary ST- and T-wave changes usually revert promptly to the prior pattern, whereas some secondary repolarization changes take longer (hours or days) to develop and to dissipate, such as those associated with prolonged ventricular pacing.

### Mexiletine hydrochloride (mexiletine HCl) [^114CVX1V]. FDA (2008). Low credibility.

General

If a ventricular pacemaker is operative, patients with second or third degree heart block may be treated with mexiletine hydrochloride if continuously monitored. A limited number of patients (45 of 475 in controlled clinical trials) with pre-existing first degree AV block were treated with mexiletine; none of these patients developed second or third degree AV block. Caution should be exercised when it is used in such patients or in patients with pre-existing sinus node dysfunction or intraventricular conduction abnormalities.

Like other antiarrhythmics mexiletine hydrochloride can cause worsening of arrhythmias. This has been uncommon in patients with less serious arrhythmias (frequent premature beats or non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (see ADVERSE REACTIONS), but is of greater concern in patients with life-threatening arrhythmias such as sustained ventricular tachycardia. In patients with such arrhythmias subjected to programmed electrical stimulation or to exercise provocation, 10 to 15% of patients had exacerbation of the arrhythmia, a rate not greater than that of other agents.

Mexiletine should be used with caution in patients with hypotension and severe congestive heart failure because of the potential for aggravating these conditions.

Since mexiletine is metabolized in the liver, and hepatic impairment has been reported to prolong the elimination half-life of mexiletine, patients with liver disease should be followed carefully while receiving mexiletine. The same caution should be observed in patients with hepatic dysfunction secondary to congestive heart failure.

Concurrent drug therapy or dietary regimens which may markedly alter urinary pH should be avoided during mexiletine hydrochloride therapy. The minor fluctuations in urinary pH associated with normal diet do not affect the excretion of mexiletine.

### Hepatic iron overload or cirrhosis may occur in acquired copper deficiency and is likely mediated by hypoceruloplasminemia [^112YnHts]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

The metabolic fates of copper and iron are closely linked through ceruloplasmin and hephaestin. Ceruloplasmin is the principal copper carrying protein and decreases in acquired copper deficiency. Congenital absence of ceruloplasmin (aceruloplasminemia) results in tissue iron overload. Animal studies suggest hypoceruloplasminemia and impaired hephaestin function result in tissue iron accumulation.

Objectives

There are no data on hepatic function, pathology, and iron status in patients with acquired copper deficiency. This report studies these issues in 4 patients with acquired copper deficiency.

Study

This is a retrospective review of hepatic status (imaging, liver function tests, liver biopsy) in 4 patients with neurologic and hematologic manifestations of acquired copper deficiency who also had imaging and/or pathologic evidence of hepatic dysfunction.

Results

Two patients (cases 1 and 2) showed imaging evidence of cirrhosis and pathologic evidence of cirrhosis or advanced fibrosis. Two patients (cases 3 and 4) had pathologic evidence of hepatic iron overload. All patients had some evidence of abnormality on liver function tests.

Conclusions

Acquired copper deficiency causes a secondary ceruloplasmin deficiency which can result in hepatic iron overload and/or cirrhosis.

### Rationale and design of a randomised trial of trientine in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [^112hqCKy]. Heart (2023). Medium credibility.

Rationale for trientine in HCM

Trientine dihydrochloride is a highly selective copper II chelator that is licensed in Wilson disease, a genetic disorder of copper excretion. Patients with Wilson disease can exhibit a cardiac phenotype that mimics HCM.

Type II diabetes is associated with LV hypertrophy and abnormal copper homeostasis. In preclinical diabetic models, trientine is associated with reduced LV hypertrophy and fibrosis, and improved LV function, cardiomyocyte structure and organisation of muscle fibres. In a randomised placebo-controlled trial in patients with type 2 diabetes and LV hypertrophy, 12 months of trientine dihydrochloride 1200 mg/day was associated with a significant reduction in LV hypertrophy (change in left ventricular mass indexed to body surface area (LVMi) with trientine: −10.6 ± 7.6 g/m 2 vs placebo −0.1 ± 9.8 g/m 2; p < 0.01) without changes in blood pressure or glucose. The decrease in LVMi was independently determined by the trientine-induced cumulative urinary copper excretion, and urine copper excretion was higher in patients with higher baseline LV mass. As such, trientine appears to modulate key pathological features of HCM, that is, LV hypertrophy, cardiomyocyte disarray and fibrosis.

### Safety of intrauterine contraceptive device (copper T 200 B) in women with cardiac disease [^1171wEXC]. Contraception (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Women with cardiac disease have need for effective long-lasting reversible contraception. Women with cardiac disease are at increased risk for bacterial endocarditis. There is limited research regarding the use of intrauterine contraceptive devices (IUD) in women with cardiac disease.

Study Design

In a prospective study, the IUD copper (Cu T200B) was inserted in 40 women with cardiac disease. Infective endocarditis prophylaxis was given 1 h before IUD insertion. The IUD was inserted under aseptic conditions. Ten milliliters of venous blood was obtained for culture of aerobic and anerobic bacteria within 1 h of insertion of the copper T IUD. Women were contacted for follow-up at frequent intervals.

Results

There was no incidence of uterine perforation, hemorrhage or spontaneous expulsion of the IUD. All blood cultures were sterile. There were no cases of infective endocarditis. Four women (10%) had menorrhagia at the 6-month follow-up which responded to medical management. One woman had PID for which antibiotics were given. Five women had mild cramps and five had spotting after insertion of the IUD. Patient adherence was excellent as none returned for removal for reasons other than desire for another pregnancy.

Conclusion

The Cu T200B IUD is a reasonably safe and effective method of temporary contraception in women with cardiac disease who are not receiving anticoagulant therapy.

### HRS / EHRA expert consensus statement on the state of genetic testing for the channelopathies and cardiomyopathies this document was developed as a partnership between the Heart Rhythm Society (HRS) and the European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA) [^1156m32a]. Heart Rhythm (2011). Medium credibility.

HRS/EHRA — therapeutic implications of restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM) genetic testing explain that while direct therapeutic application of a genetic test result for RCM has not been definitively demonstrated, such results may impact the assessment of arrhythmia; for disorders with multi-system involvement, recognition of an underlying syndrome that results in restrictive cardiac physiology can lead to disease-specific therapy, such as transplantation for TTR-amyloidosis or replacement enzyme infusions for some storage diseases; the combination of RCM with elevated serum creatine kinase suggests a mutation in genes encoding desmin (DES) or lamin A/C (LMNA); and because these are associated with relatively high rates of sudden cardiac death, RCM secondary to DES or LMNA should prompt consideration of a prophylactic ICD, particularly in the setting of AV block or bundle branch block.

X-ray system configuration and dose rates — The x-ray system should provide beam spectral filtering that is consistent with current standards, and current systems provide both aluminum and copper filtration selected automatically to achieve optimal image quality and beam filtration. The x-ray system should provide reduced-dose operating protocols for low-dose and low frame rate imaging programs, and ideally the low-dose fluoroscopic calibration should be very low (on the order of 2.0 nGy per pulse). A typical standard (or intermediate)-dose fluoroscopic dose rate is on the order of 40 nGy/pulse, and typical cine acquisition detector input doses range from 140 to 240 nGy/pulse.

Iron-overload cardiomyopathy — hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is common among people with northern European ancestry and is the most identified genetic disorder among whites; in America, the incidence is 1 case per 500 people, and cardiac involvement occurs as much as 35% of the time. Survival with cardiac HH is only 44% at 1 year and < 25% at 5 years. A common cause of iron-loading anemia is β thalassemia major, which is present in ≈60 000 births annually; in β thalassemia major with cardiac iron overload, cardiomyopathy accounts for 71% of deaths, symptoms typically present by the sixth month of life, and average survival is 3.5 years.

### 2012 ACCF / AHA / HRS focused update of the 2008 guidelines for device-based therapy of cardiac rhythm abnormalities: a report of the American college of cardiology foundation / American Heart Association task force on practice guidelines [^114qm1gJ]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2012). Medium credibility.

Device Guideline: 2012 update — scope, applicability, and follow-up emphasize that the guideline focuses on the appropriate use of heart pacing devices (e.g., pacemakers for bradyarrhythmias and heart failure management, cardiac resynchronization, and implantable cardioverter-defibrillators [ICDs]), not the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias. A device listed as a Class I indication (beneficial, useful, and effective) does not preclude other therapeutic modalities that may be equally effective, and recommendations target an average patient and may be modified by comorbidities, limitations of life expectancy, and circumstances judged by the primary treating physician. Follow-up is underscored because optimal results require device adjustment to changing clinical conditions and because advisories and recalls highlight that devices are not infallible and failures of electronics, batteries, and leads can occur. The committee did not include a section on extraction of failed/unused leads owing to the absence of convincing evidence for timing and methods, and the question of when to discontinue long-term cardiac pacing or defibrillator therapy has not been studied sufficiently; this topic is addressed to emphasize the importance of patient-family-physician discussion and ethical principles. Many indications use the modifier "potentially reversible", referring to abnormal pathophysiology that may result from reversible factors such as complete heart block due to drug toxicity (digitalis), electrolyte abnormalities, periatrioventricular node inflammation (Lyme disease), or transient injury to the conduction system at the time of open heart surgery; when faced with a potentially reversible situation, the treating physician must decide how long a waiting period is justified before device therapy is begun.

### Copper chelation in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [^113ke7by]. Open Heart (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Disturbances of copper (Cu) homeostasis can lead to hypertrophic cardiac phenotypes (eg, Wilson's disease). We previously identified abnormal Cu homeostasis in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and, therefore, hypothesised that Cu 2+ –selective chelation with trientine dihydrochloride may slow or reverse disease progression in HCM. The aim of this study was, therefore to explore the clinical efficacy, safety and tolerability of trientine in HCM.

Methods

In this medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency (MHRA) registered open-label pilot study, we treated 20 HCM patients with trientine for 6 months. Patients underwent a comprehensive assessment schedule including separate cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) and CMR 31 P-spectroscopy at baseline and end of therapy. Predefined end points included changes in left ventricular mass (LVM), markers of LV fibrosis, markers of LV performance and myocardial energetics. Ten matched patients with HCM were studied as controls.

Results

Trientine treatment was safe and tolerated. Trientine caused a substantial increase in urinary copper excretion (0.42 ± 0.2 vs 2.02 ± 1.0, p = 0.001) without affecting serum copper concentrations. Treatment was associated with significant improvements in total atrial strain and global longitudinal LV strain using both Echo and CMR. LVM decreased significantly in the treatment arm compared with the control group (−4.2 g v 1.8 g, p = 0.03). A strong trend towards an absolute decrease in LVM was observed in the treatment group (p = 0.06). These changes were associated with a significant change in total myocardial volume driven by a significant reduction in extracellular matrix (ECM) volume (43.83 ± 18.42 mL vs 41.49 ± 16.89 mL, p = 0.04) as opposed to pure cellular mass reduction and occurred against a background of significant ECM volume increase in the control group (44.59 ± 16.50 mL vs 47.48 ± 19.30 mL, p = 0.02). A non-significant 10% increase in myocardial phosphocreatine/adenosine triphosphate (PCr/ATP) ratio with trientine therapy (1.27 ± 0.44 vs 1.4 ± 0.39) was noted.

Conclusions

Cu 2+ –selective chelation with trientine in a controlled environment is safe and a potential future therapeutic target. A phase 2b trial is now underway.

Basics of operation of an x-ray cinefluorographic unit — there are 2 different x-ray fluoroscopic system parameters that are used to characterize x-ray exposure and dose, namely cumulative dose at the interventional reference point and dose at the image detector, with the latter typically ≤ 5% of the dose at the interventional reference point. Operating parameters that influence exposure include x-ray image detector dose per pulse (typically measured in nanogray (nGy)); x-ray unit framing (pulsing) rate, which generally ranges between 4 and 30 pulses/second; imaging field size (the cross-sectional area of the x-ray beam that impinges on the subject); and x-ray beam filtration, in which the lower-energy photons (photon energies < 30 keV) are filtered out by interposing layers of aluminum and copper in the x-ray tube exit port. The detector dose is considerably smaller than the subject dose, as generally ≤ 5% of the incident radiation penetrates through the subject and reaches the detector.

### Complex regulation of mitochondrial function during cardiac development [^1144js3q]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

In addition to energy production, mitochondria are the major site of ROS production. 57, 58, 59, 60 In vitro studies have shown that up to 2% of electrons flowing through the ETC are partially reduced to form superoxide anion, 61 likely at complexes I, II, and III. 57, 58 Superoxide is rapidly dismutated by superoxide dismutase (eg, MnSOD (manganese superoxide dismutase) and CuZnSOD (copper‐zinc superoxide dismutase)) to form H 2 O 2 (hydrogen peroxide), which is further reduced to H 2 O by various antioxidant enzymes such as catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and peroxiredoxins. 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67 As natural byproducts of oxygen metabolism, ROS signaling molecules regulate a variety of oxygen‐sensing machineries, including gene expression. 68, 69, 70 However, excessive ROSs are toxic and can oxidize large molecules such as proteins, DNA, and lipids, which can lead to oxidative damage. 57, 64, 71 In addition, oxidative stress can promote the pathological opening of the mPTP, causing mitochondrial swelling, membrane rupture, and cell death. 72, 73, 74, 75 ROS overload also can deplete the intracellular redox pool, 76 impairing cellular Ca 2+ handling, 77 ion channel activity, and ROS‐mediated redox signaling pathways. 78, 79, 80, 81

### Diabetic cardiomyopathy is associated with defective myocellular copper regulation and both defects are rectified by divalent copper chelation [^116vUMu4]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In conclusion, we have identified for the first time, a diabetes-induced process that impairs myocellular copper-transport, leading to severe localized copper deficiency in the LV-myocardium. This myocardial copper deficiency elicits severe LV dysfunction that leads to DCM, which is reversed by TETA treatment in the model we employed here. Our parallel investigations in patients with LV hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction caused by type-2 diabetes, have indicated that a similar process probably occurs in humans with DCM, who show signs of systemic copper overload, and in whom excessive LV mass was markedly improved by TETA treatment. We also show here that this newly-recognized pathway can serve as a target for drug discovery. For example, TETA treatment normalized myocardial copper content and could thus contribute to the maintenance or restoration of normal myocardial function in diabetes, by restoring myocellular copper transport and antioxidant defenses. Our findings provide a worked example for targeting a newly-recognized myocardial copper transport pathway for pharmaceutical discovery, using an approach based on highly-selective Cu (II) chelation, which is shown here to restore several defective, myocardial copper-trafficking processes that would otherwise conspire to cause DCM and heart failure. These findings have the potential to alter the management of DCM.

Nonischemic Dilated Cardiomyopathy

CCDs are also common in patients with nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) significantly affecting their long‐term clinical outcomes. In these patients, structural remodeling of the heart, marked by ventricular dilation and impaired contractility, disrupts normal electrical conduction pathways, leading to arrhythmias such as BBBs and atrioventricular blocks. These disturbances can worsen heart failure symptoms and increase the risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD). The underlying mechanisms for these conduction abnormalities typically involve myocardial fibrosis and alterations in the cardiac electrical system, resulting in delayed conduction and impaired synchronization of ventricular contraction.

Iron‐Overload Cardiomyopathy

CCDs may be also diagnosed in young patients with iron overload cardiomyopathy, which can result from conditions like hereditary hemochromatosis or repeated blood transfusions. Excess iron accumulation in the myocardium leads to structural and electrical abnormalities that disrupt normal conduction pathways. The severity of CCD typically correlates with the extent of iron deposition, generally leading to first‐ and second‐degree type I atrioventricular blocks. Additionally, iron presence in the conduction system can cause nodal disease, and its heterogeneous distribution within cardiac tissue can result in nonuniform conduction velocities, increasing the risk of arrhythmias. Thalassemia cardiomyopathy is a significant manifestation of iron overload resulting from repeated blood transfusions, which are commonly used to manage thalassemia. These iron‐overload cardiomyopathy, share several pathophysiological mechanisms related to iron deposition in the myocardium, which can lead to similar clinical outcomes, such as restrictive cardiomyopathy or DCM. Patients with beta‐thalassemia major, who rely on repeated blood transfusions for survival, exhibit a high incidence of arrhythmias, with a median age of 26 years at presentation. Among these patients, CCDs are common, showing histochemical evidence of fibrosis in the sinoatrial node, atrioventricular node, and His bundle in those not treated with chelation therapy. In recent years, iron chelation therapy has become the standard of care, leading to a significant reduction in the incidence of heart block.

Left Ventricular Noncompaction

In left ventricular noncompaction, the disorganized architecture of the myocardium is often associated with CCD, which can significantly affect long‐term outcomes. An embryonic arrest in the development of the left ventricular myocardium results in a thin, hypocontractile ventricular wall with extensive hypertrabeculated areas. As the disease progresses, myocardial fibrosis may develop, further impairing both cardiac contractility and conduction. Early identification and appropriate management are crucial for preventing the consequences of heart failure and arrhythmic complications.

### Sleep fragmentation exacerbates myocardial ischemia ‒ reperfusion injury by promoting copper overload in cardiomyocytes [^113oBsir]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Sleep disorders increase the risk and mortality of heart disease, but the brain-heart interaction has not yet been fully elucidated. Cuproptosis is a copper-dependent type of cell death activated by the excessive accumulation of intracellular copper. Here, we showed that 16 weeks of sleep fragmentation (SF) resulted in elevated copper levels in the male mouse heart and exacerbated myocardial ischemia–reperfusion injury with increased myocardial cuproptosis and apoptosis. Mechanistically, we found that SF promotes sympathetic overactivity, increases the germination of myocardial sympathetic nerve terminals, and increases the level of norepinephrine in cardiac tissue, thereby inhibits VPS35 expression and leads to impaired ATP7A related copper transport and copper overload in cardiomyocytes. Copper overload further leads to exacerbated cuproptosis and apoptosis, and these effects can be rescued by excision of the sympathetic nerve or administration of copper chelating agent. Our study elucidates one of the molecular mechanisms by which sleep disorders aggravate myocardial injury and suggests possible targets for intervention.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2012). Medium credibility.

Atrioventricular block — general decision factors and special scenarios: In a patient with third-degree AV block, permanent pacing should be strongly considered even when the ventricular rate is more than 40 bpm, because the choice of a 40 bpm cutoff in these guidelines was not determined from clinical trial data, and the site of origin of the escape rhythm is more critical than the escape rate. AV block provoked by exercise that is not secondary to myocardial ischemia is usually due to His-Purkinje disease and is associated with a poor prognosis; thus, pacing is indicated, whereas long sinus pauses and AV block during sleep apnea are reversible and do not require pacing in the absence of symptoms, though if symptoms are present, pacing is indicated as in other conditions. Decisions about implanting a pacemaker must consider whether AV block will be permanent; reversible causes should be corrected first, some causes may resolve (e.g. Lyme disease, hypervagotonia, perioperative hypothermia or inflammation), but some conditions may warrant implantation due to risk of progression even if block reverses transiently (e.g., sarcoidosis, amyloidosis, neuromuscular diseases), and after valve surgery the decision is at the physician's discretion; physiological AV block with supraventricular tachyarrhythmias is not an indication, and neurocardiogenic causes in young patients should be assessed before proceeding with permanent pacing.

### Contaminant metals as cardiovascular risk factors: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^112xQhPZ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

BIOLOGICAL MECHANISMS

Overview

Experimental studies in vivo and in vitro indicate that exposure to contaminant metals alters key biological pathways with shared roles on the regulation of cardiac and vascular functions, including impaired vascular endothelial function, chronic inflammation, hypertension, kidney toxicity (affecting primarily the proximal tubule), oxidative stress, lipid metabolism, myocardial electric perturbations, cardiotoxic effects, and epigenetic effects,(Figure 2). A common mechanism for several metals to cause such disparate effects involves replacement of essential divalent cations. Lead replaces calcium in tissues and metabolic pathways where calcium is involved, interfering with critical intracellular reactions and functions. Cadmium replaces zinc (again a divalent cation) in numerous enzymes and metalloproteins, accumulating in liver, kidney, and other soft tissues, and rendering those enzymes and proteins dysfunctional. Other essential divalent cations, notably copper, may be substituted as well. Unique toxic effects of each metal may be present as well, without necessarily invoking the replacement of essential metals. With regards to exposure levels and health effects, this statement focuses not on metal poisoning, as is seen with high level industrial exposures, but rather on low levels that are reached daily in our communities. Many mechanisms discussed are dose dependent, but data from in vitro and in vivo studies using model organisms are difficult to extrapolate to human exposures. When possible, we have highlighted evidence at lower doses. With the evidence available, none of the 3 metals discussed exhibit a clear threshold effect, below which one would expect no detectable cardiovascular damage when compared with a population without exposure.

Amyloidosis arrhythmia treatment recommendations — For conduction disease, in both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals with cardiac amyloidosis and second-degree atrioventricular (AV) block type II, high-grade AV block or third-degree AV block, a permanent pacemaker is recommended (COR I, LOE B-NR). For secondary prevention, in individuals with cardiac amyloidosis who have survived a cardiac arrest, an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) is recommended if meaningful survival greater than 1 year is expected (COR I, LOE C-EO). For AL-type (amyloid light-chain [AL]) with nonsustained ventricular arrhythmias, a prophylactic ICD may be considered if meaningful survival greater than 1 year is expected (COR IIb, LOE B-NR). For symptomatic atrial arrhythmias in cardiac amyloidosis, the use of sotalol, dofetilide, or amiodarone may be considered (COR IIb, LOE C-EO), cardiac ablation may be considered (COR IIb, LOE C-LD), and the use of digoxin may be considered if used with caution due to the high risk of toxicity (COR IIb, LOE B-NR).

### Copper chelation in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [^111mT6Cw]. Open Heart (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Disturbances of copper (Cu) homeostasis can lead to hypertrophic cardiac phenotypes (eg, Wilson's disease). We previously identified abnormal Cu homeostasis in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and, therefore, hypothesised that Cu 2+ -selective chelation with trientine dihydrochloride may slow or reverse disease progression in HCM. The aim of this study was, therefore to explore the clinical efficacy, safety and tolerability of trientine in HCM.

Methods

In this medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency (MHRA) registered open-label pilot study, we treated 20 HCM patients with trientine for 6months. Patients underwent a comprehensive assessment schedule including separate cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) and CMR 31 P-spectroscopy at baseline and end of therapy. Predefined end points included changes in left ventricular mass (LVM), markers of LV fibrosis, markers of LV performance and myocardial energetics. Ten matched patients with HCM were studied as controls.

Results

Trientine treatment was safe and tolerated. Trientine caused a substantial increase in urinary copper excretion (0.42 ± 0.2 vs 2.02 ± 1.0, p = 0.001) without affecting serum copper concentrations. Treatment was associated with significant improvements in total atrial strain and global longitudinal LV strain using both Echo and CMR. LVM decreased significantly in the treatment arm compared with the control group (-4.2g v 1.8g, p = 0.03). A strong trend towards an absolute decrease in LVM was observed in the treatment group (p = 0.06). These changes were associated with a significant change in total myocardial volume driven by a significant reduction in extracellular matrix (ECM) volume (43.83 ± 18.42 mL vs 41.49 ± 16.89 mL, p = 0.04) as opposed to pure cellular mass reduction and occurred against a background of significant ECM volume increase in the control group (44.59 ± 16.50 mL vs 47.48 ± 19.30 mL, p = 0.02). A non-significant 10% increase in myocardial phosphocreatine/adenosine triphosphate (PCr/ATP) ratio with trientine therapy (1.27 ± 0.44 vs 1.4 ± 0.39) was noted.

Conclusions

Cu 2+ -selective chelation with trientine in a controlled environment is safe and a potential future therapeutic target. A phase 2b trial is now underway.

Methods

Study design

This was an open-label single-site pilot study including 20 patients with HCM. Written, informed consent was obtained from all participants.

Ten additional age and gender-matched patients with HCM were recruited to a parallel 'natural-history-control' observational study to allow comparison of baseline and end-point data (ref: 14/NW/0060). Recruitment criteria were identical to those for the pilot study.

Patient Selection

Inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) age ≥ 18 years, (2) a clinical diagnosis of HCM in line with the 2011 American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart Association consensus document, (3) LV ejection fraction ≥ 50%. Exclusion criteria are shown listed in the supplementary data (online supplemental table S1).

Intervention

Patients received trientine dihydrochloride 300 mg capsules at an initial dose of 300 mg two times per day, which was increased after 1 week to 600 mg two times per day if tolerated. Trientine was given for 6 months. Dose reductions were permitted in patients experiencing an adverse event. Patients were asked to return remaining capsules at each visit to assess compliance.

Study outline visit schedule

Online supplemental figure 1 in the supplementary data shows a study design flowchart. It was initially intended to schedule study visits at approximately 1 month, 2-month and 3-month intervals, however, for ease of dispensing of bottles of trientine (one bottle = 25 days supply) and to limit time away from refrigeration, patients were followed up at 25-day multiples, without affecting study safety or integrity. No formal assessment of quality of life was performed.

Patients in the observational control study underwent cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) and phosphorous cardiac magnetic resonance spectroscopy (31 P-CMRS) baseline and again at 6 months to match the trientine pilot study.

### Myocardial involvement characteristics by cardiac MR imaging in neurological and non-neurological Wilson disease patients [^114LKc2v]. Insights Into Imaging (2024). Medium credibility.

In our study, there was a significant difference in ECV between the WD-neuro + group and WD-neuro − group, and the same results also were found in myocardial segmental analysis (Figs. 4 and 5). To our knowledge, this is the first report delineating variations in myocardial involvement between WD-neuro + and WD-neuro − patients in Asia. These findings align with prior work by Salatzki et al. The more severe myocardial damage observed in WD-neuro + patients compared to WD-neuro − patients can be attributed to the longer duration of copper overload in those with neurological manifestations. WD-neuro + patients are considered to be at a more advanced disease stage, as the emergence of neurological symptoms typically occurs later in the disease course. The subtle initial signs of WD often delay clinical diagnosis and treatment. Consequently, by the time neurological symptoms appear, WD-neuro + patients have likely been exposed to elevated copper levels for an extended period compared to WD-neuro − patients. The prolonged copper overload supports the direct cardiotoxic effects of copper on myocardial tissues in WD, though the specific mechanisms require further investigation.

Atrioventricular block — infectious and medication-related reversibility: In patients with atrioventricular block and an acute infection such as Lyme disease, effective antibiotic treatment usually reverses the block, though resolution may take a month or longer, and in general permanent pacing is not warranted; if the block does not resolve, permanent pacing will be needed. Lyme disease involves the myocardium in approximately 5% of affected patients and atrioventricular block typically resolves after 1 to 2 weeks of antibiotic treatment. Drug toxicity or overdose can cause transient or reversible block, but new-onset block on chronic stable doses of atrioventricular nodal blockers often does not resolve or can recur, so continued surveillance for recurrence is useful or even consideration for permanent pacing after discontinuation; although permanent pacemaker (PPM) implantation is relatively low risk, procedural complications and death can occur and implanted leads have long-term implications.

Sinus node dysfunction (SND) epidemiology and pathophysiology — SND, historically referred to as sick sinus syndrome, is most often related to age-dependent, progressive, degenerative fibrosis of the sinus nodal tissue and surrounding atrial myocardium, leading to abnormalities of impulse formation/propagation and bradycardia or pause-related syndromes; atrial arrhythmias can coexist with sinus node disease in the "tachy-brady syndrome". There is evidence that heart block occurs in a portion of patients who have required permanent atrial pacing for SND, suggesting fibrotic involvement of the specialized atrioventricular conduction system. Data from permanent pacemaker studies and large cohorts suggest that SND is most common in individuals who are in their 70s or 80s, and common concurrent issues include ischemic heart disease, heart failure, valvular heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, and atrial fibrillation. Intrinsic sinus or atrioventricular nodal disease can present similarly to extrinsic/secondary processes (e.g., myocardial ischemia or infarction, infiltrative diseases, collagen vascular disease, surgical trauma, endocrine abnormalities, autonomic effects, neuromuscular disorders) that compromise impulse initiation and propagation, and whether intrinsic or extrinsic, the clinical manifestations can be identical.

### The arrhythmogenic cardiotoxicity of the quinoline and structurally related antimalarial drugs: a systematic review [^116Bp8Wa]. BMC Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Bradycardia

Bradycardia was reported in 3.9% of 3099 participants after mefloquine, 1.6% of 774 after halofantrine, and 10.8% of 452 after amodiaquine. Although nausea and vomiting are common in malaria, particularly in children, and may be provoked by antimalarial drugs, the association with nausea was not reported.

Atrioventricular block

Halofantrine was associated with atrioventricular block: 25 episodes of first-degree block were reported of 774 participants who had ECGs (3.2%), while two children had second-degree Mobitz type 1 (Wenkebach) block after treatment for falciparum malaria. Following quinine, amodiaquine, and mefloquine (with SP), 2.5% (57/2320), 0.4% (2/452), and 0.2% (7/3099) respectively of participants with ECG recordings developed first-degree heart block.

Others

Other ECG abnormalities were described in patients undergoing treatment for cerebral malaria although investigators attributed these to severity of malaria illness rather than drug treatment. A 20-year-old male developed Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome following piperaquine which was not detected on baseline ECGs. The significance of this apparent revelation of an accessory conduction pathway is uncertain.

QT assessment

Due to the heterogeneity of ECG methodology, analytical techniques and reporting, as well as the large volume of missing reported information, it was not possible to perform the planned analysis to quantitate the antimalarial drug effects on the QT interval. The mean maximal change from baseline (Bazett's corrected QT interval, QTcB) and the individual maximum QTcB or QTcF (Fridericia's corrected) values were the most frequently detailed outcomes but were insufficient to perform a quantitative analysis.

Analytical and reporting heterogeneity included using different measures of central tendency (mean or median), reporting the QT interval corrected for heart rate variation by different methods, reporting absolute values at different time points (as ECGs were performed at various time points across studies), or changes from a certain time (most often the baseline) either as an absolute value or a proportion. Many studies, despite performing ECGs as part of the trial, either did not report ECG findings or only stated that none were clinically relevant.

Secondary outcomes

### Heart-block in renal failure and hypercalcemia… [^111PGbkk]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

To the Editor. — In a recent article, Drs Dreher and Shelp described first-degree heart-block occurring in a patient with chronic renal failure and mild hypercalcemia. They postulated that the heart-block was secondary to metastatic cardiac calcification, despite no objective evidence for this, and performed total parathyroidectomy. It has been well documented, both experimentally1 and clinically, 2, 3 that hypercalcemia alone can be responsible for all degrees of heart-block. One might be reluctant to recommend a major surgical procedure in a relatively high-risk patient when medical therapy for hypercalcemia might reverse the electrocardiographic abnormality. At the very least, a medical trial to lower the serum calcium level with ECG correlation would be indicated. Schwartz KV. Heart-Block in Renal Failure and Hypercalcemia. JAMA. 1976;
