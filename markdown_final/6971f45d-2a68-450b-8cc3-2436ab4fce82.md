## Question

Treatment options for central pain syndrome, thalamus pain syndrome

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about treatment options for central pain syndrome, specifically thalamic pain syndrome. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying the diagnosis and pathophysiology to anchor treatment choices. Then, I should verify first-line pharmacologic strategies and their evidence base. Next, I will review second-line and adjunctive pharmacologic options. After that, I need to examine noninvasive neuromodulation, followed by invasive neuromodulation and ablative techniques. I will then consider interventional and emerging therapies, and finally synthesize a practical, stepwise algorithm with monitoring and prognosis considerations, making sure I double-check conflicting evidence and note uncertainties where they exist.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic construct and mechanism, because treatment hinges on getting this right. Central post-stroke pain, historically termed thalamic pain or Dejerine-Roussy syndrome, arises from lesions anywhere along the spinothalamic and thalamocortical pathways, with a predilection for the ventral posterior thalamus, and is characterized by burning, allodynia, and sensory loss in the corresponding body territory; importantly, it is a diagnosis of exclusion after ruling out peripheral nociceptive and neuropathic sources, and it reflects maladaptive plasticity with central sensitization and disinhibition rather than peripheral injury alone [^113wpgJG] [^1174TuEt] [^113mYa1A].

> Wait, let me verify the first-line pharmacologic foundation before moving on. High-quality reviews and guidelines converge on tricyclic antidepressants and gabapentinoids as initial therapy for central neuropathic pain, with amitriptyline and gabapentin most commonly used; amitriptyline augments descending inhibition and has additional benefits for sleep and mood, while gabapentin reduces neuronal hyperexcitability and has supportive case-level evidence in CPSP, though randomized data are limited and mixed across central pain syndromes [^113mYa1A] [^114Q2wg8] [^112TcPqC]. Hold on, I should double-check the strength of evidence; a systematic review of randomized trials in CPSP found little to no benefit across tested drugs, underscoring the need for cautious interpretation and individualized trials, so I will keep that caveat explicit in recommendations [^113MphAd].

> Next, I should review second-line and adjunctive pharmacologic options, and I need to ensure I do not overstate certainty. Lamotrigine has class IIB support in older reviews and may help some patients, mexiletine and fluvoxamine have been reported as options, and NMDA antagonism is mechanistically attractive. Ketamine has case-level evidence in central pain and may be considered in refractory cases, while cannabinoids have emerging but limited evidence, such as a 1:1 THC:CBD oromucosal spray case showing benefit after failure of multiple standard agents, so these should be framed as off-label or investigational with shared decision-making and attention to safety and local regulations [^114g3VHG] [^114HuEAE] [^1138DvmY]. I should confirm that opioids are not first-line for CPSP; they may be used cautiously for short-term rescue in selected patients, but chronic use risks tolerance, hyperalgesia, and limited efficacy in centralized pain, so they should be minimized and monitored closely [^114Q2wg8] [^113mYa1A].

> I will now examine noninvasive neuromodulation, and I need to check the durability and practicality of these approaches. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation targeting the motor cortex or dorsolateral prefrontal cortex can produce clinically meaningful reductions in pain intensity in small studies, but effects are transient and require repeated sessions, which creates logistical barriers; nonetheless, given favorable safety, rTMS is reasonable to trial, particularly when medications are ineffective or poorly tolerated [^113ad1jh] [^116yTm59]. Let me reconsider the magnitude of benefit; several series suggest at least 30–40% pain reduction, but small samples and short follow-up limit confidence, so expectations should be calibrated accordingly [^116yTm59].

> Now, invasive neuromodulation requires careful patient selection, and I should confirm comparative efficacy and targets. Motor cortex stimulation has shown moderate benefit in central pain syndromes, including CPSP, with response rates around 50–75% in uncontrolled series, and may be preferred over thalamic DBS in some programs due to more consistent outcomes; DBS targeting the periaqueductal or periventricular gray and sensory thalamus can help a subset, but results are heterogeneous and historically less robust in CPSP than in some peripheral pain conditions, though a recent multicenter analysis suggests approximately 36% of CPSP patients achieve at least 50% pain reduction at 12 months, with sweet spots in the posterior limb of the internal capsule and sensorimotor thalamus, and structural connectivity differences distinguishing responders from nonresponders [^113A6tkL] [^116aE1vJ] [^116UvdiU] [^1156atdN]. Hold on, I should verify the role of closed-loop or imaging guidance; emerging work suggests personalized targeting using fMRI or connectome-informed approaches may optimize outcomes, but this remains investigational and should be framed as such during counseling [^115fMtbP] [^113jPX4N].

> But wait, what if neuromodulation is unavailable or contraindicated? I need to check ablative options and their risk–benefit profile. Stereotactic radiosurgical thalamotomy targeting the centromedian or medial thalamic nuclei has case-level evidence for durable relief in refractory thalamic pain, with reports of sustained benefit up to several years in selected patients, though series are small and heterogeneous; similarly, focused ultrasound thalamotomy has been explored, including a randomized sham-controlled study in trigeminal neuropathic pain that did not meet primary endpoints, so any extrapolation to CPSP must be cautious and individualized [^114vmF4J] [^112JEhVz] [^116ezUwH]. I should confirm that ablation is irreversible and carries risks such as sensory deficits or dysesthesia, so it is generally reserved for carefully selected, medically intractable cases after multidisciplinary review [^112JEhVz].

> Let me consider interventional and emerging therapies, and I should be careful not to overgeneralize from case reports. Ultrasound-guided stellate ganglion block has case-level evidence for CPSP with cramp-like pain after thalamic hemorrhage, with rapid and complete pain resolution reported, but the mechanism remains speculative and replication is needed; similarly, pituitary radiosurgery has been reported for thalamic pain with high initial response rates but frequent relapse within 6–12 months and endocrine side effects, limiting its role to exceptional circumstances [^111vokRz] [^112r5ru7] [^117PZXsJ]. I should double-check that these are not standard of care and should be framed as experimental or last-resort options within a research or compassionate-use context [^notfound].

> Next, I should review nonpharmacologic and rehabilitative strategies, because central pain is amplified by mood, sleep, and functional deconditioning. Multidisciplinary pain rehabilitation emphasizing graded activity, sensory retraining, sleep optimization, and cognitive-behavioral strategies can reduce pain catastrophizing and improve function even when pain intensity remains unchanged. This is particularly important given the limited efficacy of medications in CPSP and the high comorbidity burden of anxiety, depression, and sleep disturbance [^1174TuEt] [^113mYa1A]. Hold on, I should verify that these are adjuncts rather than substitutes. They are best integrated early alongside pharmacotherapy and maintained longitudinally to sustain gains [^notfound].

> I need to ensure the stepwise algorithm is practical and evidence-aligned. Start with a TCA such as amitriptyline or nortriptyline titrated to effect and tolerability, or a gabapentinoid such as gabapentin or pregabalin, choosing based on comorbidities and side-effect profile. If inadequate, consider lamotrigine or mexiletine, and in refractory cases, trial rTMS or proceed to MCS or DBS after multidisciplinary evaluation, reserving ablative radiosurgery for select, intractable cases with informed consent regarding risks and uncertain durability. Throughout, maintain rehabilitation and behavioral therapies, and reassess at defined intervals to avoid therapeutic inertia [^113mYa1A] [^113ad1jh] [^113A6tkL] [^112JEhVz]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost implied opioids as routine; I should correct that and restrict opioids to carefully selected, short-term rescue scenarios with close monitoring due to limited benefit and substantial harms in centralized pain [^114Q2wg8] [^113mYa1A].

> I should double-check prognostic modifiers and monitoring to guide expectations and timing of escalation. Sensory loss and allodynia correlate with CPSP risk and severity, and lesions at the ventral posterior–pulvinar border zone carry a very high odds of developing thalamic pain; early identification of these features can prompt proactive counseling and earlier consideration of neuromodulation in refractory trajectories, while validated pain scales and patient-reported outcomes should be tracked longitudinally to detect modest but clinically meaningful improvements [^112zwoic] [^1174TuEt]. Let me verify that natural history varies; CPSP may improve over time in some patients, but a substantial proportion have persistent, treatment-refractory pain, reinforcing the need for durable, mechanism-targeted strategies and realistic goal-setting [^1174TuEt].

> Finally, I should acknowledge key uncertainties and research directions so we do not overstate current capabilities. The pathophysiology of CPSP likely involves neuroinflammation, glial activation, and maladaptive network plasticity, but translation to targeted pharmacology remains early; personalized neuromodulation using imaging and connectivity biomarkers, and closed-loop systems, are promising but not yet standard, and high-quality randomized trials of both drugs and devices are urgently needed to resolve conflicting evidence and define optimal sequencing and patient selection [^113mYa1A] [^113RvRkM] [^113jPX4N] [^113MphAd]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; until then, care should remain interdisciplinary, iterative, and anchored in shared decision-making that balances modest expected benefits against risks, costs, and patient preferences [^113mYa1A].

---

Treatment of thalamic pain syndrome (central post-stroke pain) is **multimodal and individualized**, with **first-line pharmacologic options** (gabapentin, pregabalin, TCAs, SNRIs) and **neuromodulation** (rTMS, motor cortex stimulation, deep brain stimulation) for refractory cases [^113mYa1A] [^113ad1jh]. Evidence is limited; **amitriptyline and lamotrigine** have the most support, while gabapentin and pregabalin are widely used for efficacy and tolerability [^114g3VHG] [^113mYa1A]. Noninvasive options like rTMS may help some patients, but invasive therapies (MCS, DBS) are reserved for refractory cases with careful selection [^113ad1jh] [^113A6tkL]. Management should also address comorbidities and use interdisciplinary care [^117RvMmF].

---

## Pharmacological treatments

### First-line pharmacological agents

- **Gabapentin and pregabalin**: Effective for central neuropathic pain; pregabalin is preferred for its predictable pharmacokinetics and fewer drug interactions.

- **Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs)**: Amitriptyline and nortriptyline are effective; amitriptyline has the most evidence in CPSP.

- **Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)**: Duloxetine and venlafaxine are options, especially with mood comorbidities.

---

### Second-line pharmacological agents

Second-line options include **lamotrigine**, supported by class IIB evidence for CPSP [^114g3VHG], and **carbamazepine**, used for refractory cases despite limited evidence. Mexiletine may be considered for refractory cases, though evidence is limited [^114g3VHG].

---

### Limited efficacy or investigational agents

Limited-efficacy or investigational options include **opioids**, which have limited benefit and risk tolerance/hyperalgesia; reserve for refractory cases [^111GZxe8]. Cannabinoids have emerging but limited evidence and may be considered when standard therapies fail [^1138DvmY].

---

## Non-pharmacological treatments

### Non-invasive neuromodulation

Among noninvasive options, **repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS)** offers modest, transient benefits and may be repeated as needed [^113ad1jh] [^114g3VHG]. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is investigational with limited evidence.

---

### Invasive neuromodulation

- **Motor cortex stimulation (MCS)**: Effective in ~50% of refractory cases; less invasive than DBS.

- **Deep brain stimulation (DBS)**: Targets thalamus/PAG; effective in selected refractory cases.

- **Spinal cord stimulation (SCS)**: Limited evidence; may help select refractory cases.

---

## Interventional procedures

Interventional options include **stellate ganglion block**, with case reports of benefit in CPSP [^111vokRz], and **pituitary radiosurgery**, which shows high initial response but frequent relapse and endocrine effects [^117PZXsJ].

---

## Emerging therapies

Emerging therapies include **focused ultrasound thalamotomy**, which is investigational with limited early data, and **closed-loop DBS**, an experimental approach targeting pain networks [^116ezUwH] [^113jPX4N].

---

## Multidisciplinary and supportive care

Multidisciplinary and supportive care should prioritize **interdisciplinary pain management** — combining pharmacologic, psychological, and physical therapies — and include **psychological interventions** such as CBT and mindfulness to reduce pain and improve function.

---

## Summary of treatment options

| **Treatment category** | **Examples** | **Evidence level** | **Comments** |
|-|-|-|-|
| First-line pharmacological | - Gabapentin <br/> - Pregabalin <br/> - Amitriptyline <br/> - Duloxetine | High | Effective; well tolerated |
| Second-line pharmacological | - Lamotrigine <br/> - Carbamazepine <br/> - Mexiletine | Moderate | Use if first-line fails |

## Conclusion

Thalamic pain syndrome requires a **stepwise approach**: start with gabapentin, pregabalin, TCAs, or SNRIs; add lamotrigine or carbamazepine if needed; and consider neuromodulation for refractory cases. Care should be interdisciplinary, with attention to comorbidities and patient preferences [^113mYa1A] [^114g3VHG].

Motor Cortex Stimulation

Of all therapies, ranging from minimally invasive to interventional, motor cortex stimulation (MCS) is the most invasive form of treatment for pain conditions, including CRPS. The mechanism of action for MCS is the modulation of pathologic hyperactivity in the thalamic relay nuclei. Deafferentation results in the loss of inhibitory control of the nociceptive neurons, and MCS has been shown to normalize this disinhibition to a greater degree than somatosensory cortex stimulation (level 4). Similar to SCS procedures, a trial is required prior to the implantation of MCS. Risks are surprisingly rare but complications may occur consistent with other chronically implanted hardware in functional neurosurgery (level 4).

According to the spirit of the Malibu treatment scheme (Figure 2) simpler, less invasive, less dangerous and less expensive interventional techniques should be tried before invasive, experimental and much more expensive techniques (Figure 4 and Appendix A2).

Inadequate or partial response to any mentioned therapy may lead to a stepwise progression down through modalities always in conjunction with other non-interventional treatments.

In this 5th edition of these diagnostic and treatment guidelines, we find progress evident in diagnosis, clinical outcome measures, and evidence-based treatments compared to prior versions. Nonetheless, the conclusion in prior guidelines that "we need more high quality research regarding CRPS interventions" still stands. There are few interventions with efficacy that has been convincingly demonstrated, and until such data are available, reliance on the standard clinical principles of interdisciplinary pain and symptom management will be necessary. While evidence for efficacy of most CRPS interventions remains weak in CRPS patients as a group, we suggest that going forward there may be value in exploring intervention efficacy within empirically-identified CRPS subtypes (e.g. warm vs cold CRPS) to determine whether a precision medicine approach to CRPS management could enhance outcomes. In each clinical situation the specific risk, benefit and expense of any intervention must be carefully and continuously considered.

### Reduction of central neuropathic pain with ketamine infusion in a patient with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome: a case report [^114HuEAE]. Journal of Pain Research (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Ketamine is an NMDA receptor antagonist with efficacy in central neuropathic pain, ischemic pain, and regional pain syndrome. Central pain syndrome can cause significant disability and impaired quality of life. It occurs in patients with central nervous system pathologies such as SCI, stroke, and brain injury and is known to be difficult to treat with the standard treatment options. By preventing the upregulation of the NMDA receptor, ketamine provides a new approach toward the management of pain in patients with central pain syndrome related to SCI. This case is the first known report of using ketamine infusion to alleviate refractory central pain syndrome in a patient with a spinal cord myelopathy secondary to EDS. Ketamine infusion also has the potential to decrease the long-term need for other pain medications including opioids. More research is needed to establish an evidence-based treatment for pain related to EDS.

### Neuropathic central pain… [^116DFuAy]. JAMA Network (2001). Excellent credibility.

Present evidence supports the central importance of the NMDA receptor of the DH in the induction and maintenance of central sensitization observed in many chronic pain states. 20 In the setting of a maintained C-fiber nociceptive input, the magnesium blockade of the NMDA receptor on CPPNs is lifted because of cumulative depolarization by summated nociceptor-evoked slow synaptic potentials. Both types project to lamina I, II, and V of the DH and are activated by stimulation of the PAG. Off-cells are activated and on-cells are inhibited by morphine. 33 Off-cells are part of the descending inhibitory system mediated from the rostral ventromedial medulla through the dorsolateral funiculi, while on-cells constitute a descending nociceptive facilitation pathway traveling through the ventrolateral funiculi to the DH. Descending facilitation may function to counterbalance descending inhibition to maintain some degree of pain responsiveness.

These mechanisms vary widely and include poorly healed fractures, neuromas, brachial plexus traction injuries, unsuspected neuropathies, and radiculopathies; the use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs to reduce peripheral sensitization and modulate the activity of nociceptors;. the use of tricyclic antidepressants to induce sleep and decrease lancinating and burning neuropathic pain; a trial of Gebapentin, lamotrigine, and topamax; intravenous lidocaine for treatment of widespread hyperalgesia, allodynia. and hyperpathia; sympathetic blockade for complex regional pain syndrome/reflex sympathetic dystrophy while patients are still sympathetically maintained; dorsal column stimulation for areas that can be completely covered by induced paraesthesia; and intrathecal therapies including morphine, clonidine, and GABA agonists when other less invasive therapies have failed.
36.

The most exciting aspect of this report is the demonstration that glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor may reverse some aspects of central sensitization. 37 Another drug under clinical investigation is ziconotide, a selective neuronal N-type calcium channel blocker. Intrathecal ziconotide has been shown to be more potent, longer lasting, and more antinociceptive than morphine. It may also block aspects of central sensitization. 38 These new developments offer hope to a large number of patients.

Nociplastic Pain in CRPS

An indication for nociplastic pain in CRPS is that allodynia and hyperalgesia are not necessarily restricted to the affected CRPS extremity. This is illustrated by, for instance, hemi-lateral distribution of allodynia and hyperalgesia in CRPS patients. Evidence that central sensitization contributes to the pathophysiology of CRPS, is that temporal summation is increased in the affected CRPS extremity. In addition, CRPS patients with an extended pain pattern had a more prominent temporal summation in the CRPS extremity and were associated with more disturbance of body perception. The wider spread of allodynia and hyperalgesia in CRPS could be the result of increased excitability in the brainstem or higher brain centers and a deficient endogenous pain inhibition system. To visualize the wider spread of allodynia, the Michigan Body Map is suggested to be added as a clinical outcome parameter in CRPS studies.

Several imaging studies have studied the structural, functional, and chemical changes of the brain in CRPS patients. For instance, a reduced representation of the affected CRPS extremity and an increased representation of the contralateral unaffected extremity are shown. These changes in representation can return to normal in patients that respond to their treatment. Functional changes are shown by increased activity in pain regions such as the somatosensory cortex, insula, frontal cortex, and anterior cingulate cortex during pinprick hyperalgesia and an increased resting state activity and connectivity is reported between the thalamus and somatosensory cortex. In addition, impaired endogenous pain inhibitory pathways and the reorganization of the somatosensory cortex correlated with pain severity. Unexpectedly, a recent magnetic resonance spectroscopy study showed that CRPS was not associated with altered GABA or glutamate concentrations. Furthermore, two positron emission tomography studies confirmed neuroinflammation in CRPS and this underlines the facilitation of central sensitization in CRPS.

Regarding pharmacotherapeutic treatment, pain medication from the WHO analgesic ladder is less effective for nociplastic pain than for nociceptive pain. Opioids should be avoided because of the risk of tolerance, induced hyperalgesia and the known mortality and morbidity of chronic opioid use. Drugs that target central sensitization may be used for nociplastic pain such as gabapentin and intravenous ketamine.

### Comprehensive evidence-based guidelines for implantable peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS) in the management of chronic pain: from the American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) [^113EbFNx]. Pain Physician (2024). High credibility.

Peripheral nerve stimulation — analgesic outcomes and neuroimaging: Research has demonstrated that PNS, combined with transcranial magnetic stimulation (paired associative stimulation), can induce long-term changes in cortical excitability, while suboccipital PNS for migraine has shown no significant changes in cerebral blood flow on positron emission tomography and other studies have noted increased blood flow in the anterior cingulate and insular cortices, anteroventral insula, and thalamus. The mechanism of PNS likely involves a combination of peripheral and central pathways, and by decreasing pain signals over time PNS therapy may disrupt centrally mediated pain, promoting activity-dependent neuroplasticity and sustaining reduced pain long after active stimulation periods. Clinical evidence suggests clinically significant and sustained reductions in pain can persist well beyond the PNS treatment period and have not previously been observed with conventional, permanently implanted neurostimulation devices. It is theorized that a widened therapeutic window enables robust and selective activation of Aα/β fibers at frequencies such as 5–150 Hz that produce comfortable yet strong sensations without activating Aδ/C afferents.

### Complex regional pain syndrome: practical diagnostic and treatment guidelines, 5th edition [^114rqzbn]. Pain Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

There have been some modest recent advancements in the research of Complex Regional Pain Syndrome, yet the amount and quality of the work in this complicated multifactorial disease remains low (with some notable exceptions; e.g., the recent work on the dorsal root ganglion stimulation). The semi-systematic (though in some cases narrative) approach to review is necessary so that we might treat our patients while waiting for "better research". This semi-systematic review was conducted by experts in the field, (deliberately) some of whom are promising young researchers supplemented by the experience of "elder statesman" researchers, who all mention the system they have used to examine the literature. What we found is generally low- to medium-quality research with small numbers of subjects; however, there are some recent exceptions to this. The primary reason for this paucity of research is the fact that this is a rare disease, and it is very difficult to acquire a sufficient sample size for statistical significance using traditional statistical approaches. Several larger trials have failed, probably due to using the broad general diagnostic criteria (the "Budapest" criteria) in a multifactorial/multi-mechanism disease. Responsive subsets can often be identified in these larger trials, but not sufficient to achieve statistically significant results in the general diagnostic grouping. This being the case the authors have necessarily included data from less compelling protocols, including trials such as case series and even in some instances case reports/empirical information. In the humanitarian spirit of treating our often desperate patients with this rare syndrome, without great evidence, we must take what data we can find (as in this work) and tailor a treatment regime for each patient.

The Rationale for Functional Restoration

CRPS can be a very difficult condition to treat successfully. Not only is the syndrome bio-medically multifaceted, comprising both central and peripheral pathophysiology, but it also frequently contains psychosocial components that are additional pivotal diagnostic features (and thus, critical treatment targets). The array of possible patient presentations and the fact that the presentation often changes over time also complicate successful identification and treatment. To further add to the clinical challenges of managing CRPS, the epidemiology and natural history of CRPS are only superficially known; evidence concerning CRPS treatment has developed slowly due in large part to the early vagaries of diagnosis (see above); and, moreover, research data — when they are available — are sometimes challenging to interpret. Given these obstacles to diagnosis, treatment, and research, how is a specialist to embark on a path toward the successful treatment of such a complicated and partially understood condition? The only treatment methodology that can possibly successfully span these gaps in medical science is a systematic and orderly interdisciplinary approach. Interdisciplinary treatment is defined (here) as a dedicated, coherent, coordinated, specially trained group of relevant professionals that meet regularly to plan, coordinate care, and adapt to treatment eventualities. Less desirable (but more accessible) is multidisciplinary treatment (a single practitioner coordinates all the various specialties).

### Evaluation and treatment of central pain syndromes [^115HwFeY]. Neurology (2004). Low credibility.

Central pain syndromes represent a form of neuropathic pain that is associated with lesions of the brain or the spinal cord after a stroke or other traumatic injury. Although spinal cord injury (SCI) pain and central post-stroke pain (CPSP) are both classified as central pain syndromes, they may have differing etiologies. The pathophysiology of SCI pain and CPSP has yet to be completely elucidated, but both spinal and supraspinal pathways may be involved. Pain resulting from an injury to the CNS may be vague or difficult to classify or characterize, and patients may describe painful sensations that are poorly localized or that change over time. Pharmacologic interventions that have demonstrated efficacy in central pain syndromes include iv lidocaine and opioids as well as the tricyclic antidepressant amitriptyline and the AEDs gabapentin and lamotrigine. Nonpharmacologic interventions have also demonstrated benefit in some patients who are refractory to pharmacologic treatments. Additional studies are needed to further evaluate the efficacy and safety of both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatments for central pain syndromes.

### Pharmacotherapy of complex regional pain syndrome [^111xfxme]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2005). Low credibility.

Complex regional pain syndrome has both nociceptive/inflammatory and neuropathic elements and is always (by definition) associated with abnormal activity of the sympathetic nervous system. There is good evidence that complex regional pain syndrome, as currently conceptualized, ultimately includes central sensitization and has motor abnormalities. The lack of a standard diagnostic test or a specific mechanistically based diagnostic scheme has hindered the conduct of well-designed trials, and to date, there is very little evidence supporting an effective treatment. Fortunately, some randomized, controlled trials of drug therapies have been conducted, and systematic reviews have been published of related neuropathic conditions, from which the results have been extrapolated to clinical use in complex regional pain syndrome. The following article presents an overview of available data regarding drug and interventional treatment options for complex regional pain syndrome and of those relevant pharmacotherapies we can derive from the neuropathy literature. As with most chronic pain syndromes, pharmacotherapy coupled with functional restoration and an interdisciplinary approach to treatment are essential to a successful outcome.

### Treatment modalities for patients with persistent spinal pain syndrome type II: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^113jUkvx]. Communications Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This systematic review evaluated the different treatment options for patients with PSPS-T2, whereby 51% of the studies evaluated neuromodulation techniques, 32.7% minimal invasive treatment options, 12.2% conservative therapies and 4.1% re-operation. The network meta-analysis favoured neuromodulation above placebo/sham options. Additionally, compared to a combination of conservative and minimal invasive options, neuromodulation resulted in a significant improvement of pain intensity. Treatment ranking denoted neuromodulation as most effective for patients with PSPS-T2, followed by conservative treatment options.

In 2020, a revision of the analgesic ladder was proposed for patients with chronic non-cancer pain, in which a four-step ladder is described. This ladder incorporates integrative therapies at each step to reduce or completely omit the use of opioids. Additionally, interventional therapies are proposed as step 3 in the ladder, before upgrading to strong opioids in case of unsatisfying pain relief with non-opioids and weak opioids. Neuromodulation, as interventional therapy in the revised analgesic ladder, was ranked first to obtain pain relief in our network meta-analysis, potentially further opening the avenue towards earlier implementation of neuromodulation in the care pathway. In this review, two types of interventions were categorized as conservative treatment options namely physiotherapy and medication. The former pointed towards the use of physiotherapy sessionsin combination with cognitive treatment options, while the latter pointed towards the use of Gabapentin. A recent narrative review stated that conservative treatments, consisting of pharmacologic therapy, physical therapy, and psychotherapy, should always be attempted first due to their good safety profile in patients who do not require urgent surgical intervention. Patients with chronic pain after spinal surgery may well suffer from central sensitization (CS), characterized by altered central pain processing, whereby proposed treatment options for CS are medication, pain neuroscience education, cognitive behavioural therapy and exercise therapy, all completely in line with the conservative treatment options as revealed by our review. In terms of medication, a recent study evaluated electronic health records from 164,709 patients with PSPS-T2. Prevalences of prescription of neuropathic mood agents and opioids were 78.5% and 87.9%, respectively, in 2023. Remarkably, our review pointed towards the efficacy of Gabapentin, however, none of the included studies evaluated opioids.

Methods

Protocol and Registration

The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed during the search and reporting phase of the research process. The initial protocol and systematic review were prospectively registered on July 24, 2017 through the PROSPERO database for systematic reviews (ID: CRD42017070563).

Search Strategy

A comprehensive literature search was performed using the databases PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science between 2007 and 2018. The literature search plan was developed and performed in collaboration with a Research Librarian (LL) with expertise in systematic reviews and senior authors with expertise in stroke and pain science and rehabilitation (JF, CS). The search used key words and subject headings, appropriate for each database, related to neurostimulation, pain, and thalamic diseases.

Other Neuromodulation Approaches

Beyond SCS, several advanced neuromodulation strategies have been developed to target anatomically and functionally distinct pain syndromes. Dorsal root ganglion (DRG) stimulation modulates the cell bodies of primary sensory neurons, providing highly localized relief in focal neuropathic pain conditions such as complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS). DRG stimulation has been associated with greater positional stability and superior outcomes in select populations.

Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a neurosurgical approach that targets central pain-processing centers such as the thalamus, periaqueductal gray or anterior cingulate cortex. It is typically reserved for patients with refractory pain conditions, including central post-stroke pain or brachial plexus avulsion, and aims to modulate both sensory and affective dimensions of pain. Occipital nerve stimulation (ONS) involves the placement of subcutaneous electrodes over the occipital nerves and is primarily used for intractable craniofacial pain, such as chronic migraine, cluster headache, or occipital neuralgia. By modulating trigeminocervical pathways in the upper cervical region, ONS addresses pain regions not typically targeted by standard SCS. Peripheral field stimulation (PFS), also referred to as peripheral nerve field stimulation, places leads subcutaneously at or near the site of pain, such as in axial low back pain, to engage segmental gating mechanisms. PFS may be used alone or in combination with SCS to broaden the area of pain coverage, particularly for midline or diffuse pain syndromes. Collectively, these techniques expand the therapeutic landscape of neuromodulation. By targeting brain regions involved in emotional regulation, executive function, and pain perception, modalities such as DBS and DRG stimulation not only provide analgesia but may also improve cognitive outcomes in chronic pain populations. Their inclusion underscores the importance of a systems-level approach in treating pain and cognition as interconnected domains.

### Intracranial neurostimulation for pain control: a review [^116Swazu]. Pain Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Intracranial neurostimulation for pain relief is most frequently delivered by stimulating the motor cortex, the sensory thalamus, or the periaqueductal and periventricular gray matter. The stimulation of these sites through MCS (motor cortex stimulation) and DBS (deep brain stimulation) has proven effective for treating a number of neuropathic and nociceptive pain states that are not responsive or amenable to other therapies or types of neurostimulation. Prospective randomized clinical trials to confirm the efficacy of these intracranial therapies have not been published. Intracranial neurostimulation is somewhat different than other forms of neurostimulation in that its current primary application is for the treatment of medically intractable movement disorders. However, the increasing use of intracranial neurostimulation for the treatment of chronic pain, especially for pain not responsive to other neuromodulation techniques, reflects the efficacy and relative safety of these intracranial procedures. First employed in 1954, intracranial neurostimulation represents one of the earliest uses of neurostimulation to treat chronic pain that is refractory to medical therapy. Currently, 2 kinds of intracranial neurostimulation are commonly used to control pain: motor cortex stimulation and deep brain stimulation. MCS has shown particular promise in the treatment of trigeminal neuropathic pain and central pain syndromes such as thalamic pain syndrome. DBS may be employed for a number of nociceptive and neuropathic pain states, including cluster headaches, chronic low back pain, failed back surgery syndrome, peripheral neuropathic pain, facial deafferentation pain, and pain that is secondary to brachial plexus avulsion. The unique lack of stimulation-induced perceptual experience with MCS makes MCS uniquely suited for blinded studies of its effectiveness. This article will review the scientific rationale, indications, surgical techniques, and outcomes of intracranial neuromodulation procedures for the treatment of chronic pain.

### Central sensitization in knee osteoarthritis: relating presurgical brainstem neuroimaging and painDETECT-based patient stratification to arthroplasty outcome [^114XKYmM]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Central sensitization is defined as an amplification of neural signaling within the central nervous system that elicits pain hypersensitivity 10. It arises from a wide variety of underlying mechanisms ranging from sensitization within the spinal cord to signal amplification secondary to active descending pain facilitation pathways. The mechanisms by which central sensitization develops in OA and its impact on response to current treatment options remain unclear.

Neuroimaging provides a noninvasive objective method for measuring the central processing of pain in humans. Its utility in furthering our understanding of the pain mechanisms in patient populations and of suitable treatment options is increasingly accepted 11, 12. Previous neuroimaging studies in OA patients have demonstrated that both spontaneous and experimentally induced pain are associated with increased neural activity in brain areas involved in sensory discrimination 7, 13, 14, 15, 16 as well as with the affective and cognitive‐evaluative components of nociception 13, 14, 17. Furthermore, when compared to healthy controls, OA patients exhibited a disruption of the resting state default mode network 15 and a decrease in gray matter volume in areas such as the thalamus 16. Taken together, these findings suggest that both the structure and function of the brain are likely to be affected in patients with knee OA.

Neurology (2008). Medium credibility.

Trigeminal neuralgia — clinical features for identifying symptomatic trigeminal neuralgia (STN): seven papers (one graded Class IV) assessed clinical characteristics distinguishing STN from classic TN (CTN), including sensory deficits, age at onset, first trigeminal division involvement, bilateral trigeminal involvement, and unresponsiveness to treatment; one study was graded Class III, and four cohort studies with broad spectra were graded Class II due to retrospective data collection; across studies, first-division involvement and unresponsiveness were not associated with increased STN risk, while younger age was significantly associated with increased risk but its diagnostic accuracy was too low to be clinically useful for discriminating CTN and STN.

### Practice parameter: the diagnostic evaluation and treatment of trigeminal neuralgia (an evidence-based review): report of the quality standards subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology and the European Federation of Neurological Societies [^11197ZeW]. Neurology (2008). Medium credibility.

Predictors of symptomatic trigeminal neuralgia (STN) risk among patients with trigeminal neuralgia (TN): Younger age and abnormal trigeminal nerve evoked potentials are probably associated with an increased risk of STN, but there is too much overlap in patients with classic TN (CTN) and STN for these predictors to be considered clinically useful. The presence of trigeminal sensory deficits or bilateral involvement of the trigeminal nerves probably increases the risk of STN, whereas the absence of these features does not rule out STN. Involvement of the first division of the trigeminal nerve and unresponsiveness to treatment are probably not associated with an increased risk of STN.

### Brain stimulation for chronic pain management: a narrative review of analgesic mechanisms and clinical evidence [^113jPX4N]. Neurosurgical Review (2023). Medium credibility.

Research into the effects of DBS has resulted in the identification of a new anatomical target that appears to be a combination of the sensory and limbic systems, which takes place in a situation of painful sensations. This target turns out to be the posterior insula due to its role as a link between the spinothalamic pathway and the ventroposteromedial nucleus of the thalamus. Also confirming the need to consider this point seems to be the fact that functional imaging has demonstrated activation of the posterior insula on individuals to a level dependent on pain intensity, as well as the phenomenon of neutrality to painful stimuli occurring in patients whose brain lesion has involved the insula.

Considering the hypothesis according to chronic pain results from faulty synchronization between brain networks encoding the somatosensory, affective, and cognitive impulses, DBS seems to be an ideal source of a mechanism to interrupt this severe synchrony. The idea of closed-loop stimulation requires a device that reads brain waves of specific frequency bands from three areas of the brain (primary somatosensory cortex, the dorsal anterior cingulate, and the orbitofrontal cortex) and then determines the signals recognized as a baseline based on them. The device should be able to interpret the stronger signals and generate pulses to interrupt the disturbance experienced as pain. An alternative to this solution can be open-loop stimulation, the difference of which is the absence of the presence of sensors, so in this solution, decoupling of neural signals occurs all the time, or patient-triggered stimulation, in which the patient controls the device, but in this case, ideally, the pain signals should be of somatosensory origin.

Although the clinical studies demonstrated favorable results of applying the DBS for chronic pain treatment (Table 1), the number of patients treated by this method is declining. Lack of approval for the clinical use of this method in some countries and improvement of the other treatment approaches are some of the many factors responsible for that phenomenon. Despite that, patients with severe, exhausting neuropathic pain with objective pathology refractory to more conservative treatments seem to be the best candidates for this method.

### Central post-stroke pain: advances in clinical and preclinical research [^115CtcnS]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Central poststroke pain (CPSP) manifests as neuropathic pain (NP) during either the acute or chronic stages after a cerebrovascular incident (ischaemic or haemorrhagic) resulting from lesions in the central somatosensory pathway. Following an intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH), the occurrence rate of CPSP changes between 8% and 46%, a variation attributed to the diverse brain regions impacted, with a likelihood that patients experience a thalamic stroke. Additionally, CPSP has been reported in young ischaemic stroke (IS) survivors, with an occurrence rate of 5.9%. Typical symptoms of CPSP include persistent headache, spasticity-related pain, shoulder discomfort and musculoskeletal pain. Spontaneous pain can manifest immediately or appear several years after a stroke.

CPSP is often accompanied by symptoms such as anxiety, depression, fatigue and cognitive dissonance as well as physical dysfunction. These comorbidities intensify both the sensitivity and duration of pain, fostering a cyclical relationship between pain and negative emotions. Consequently, this results in limitations in daily activities and a decline in overall well-being. Currently, CPSP treatment is based on a combination of drug therapy and non-pharmacological interventions to alleviate pain. However, prolonged drug use often leads to various adverse effects, and the efficacy and underlying mechanisms of non-pharmacological treatments remain incompletely understood. In preclinical studies, animal models serve as tools for investigating the pathogenesis of CPSP and identifying novel therapeutic strategies. However, the animal models used for CPSP research lack comprehensive characterisation. Therefore, comparisons of different animal models, behavioural evaluation protocols and potential pathogenesis of CPSP are essential to identify suitable animal models and advance research in this field.

The increasing studies on CPSP highlight the need for a thorough and systematic analysis of existing research to enhance our understanding of CPSP and encourage novel experimental research. This review aims to provide the first comprehensive and systematic description of pain patterns and clinical manifestations among CPSP patients. This review begins with clinical studies and then moves on to animal models replicating clinical aspects, including evaluation metrics and potential pathogenesis. By summarising the features and mechanisms of CPSP from both clinical and preclinical perspectives, we suggest strategies to identify new therapeutic targets for CPSP. Furthermore, we analyse inadequacies in preclinical research design and data analysis to encourage improvements in experimental methodologies.

### Deep brain stimulation for pain in the modern era: a systematic review [^117S81jR]. Neurosurgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has been considered for patients with intractable pain syndromes since the 1950s. Although there is substantial experience reported in the literature, the indications are contested, especially in the United States where it remains off-label. Historically, the sensory-discriminative pain pathways were targeted. More recently, modulation of the affective sphere of pain has emerged as a plausible alternative.

Objective

To systematically review the literature from studies that used contemporary DBS technology. Our aim is to summarize the current evidence of this therapy.

Methods

A systematic search was conducted in the MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane libraries through July 2017 to review all studies using the current DBS technology primarily for pain treatment. Study characteristics including patient demographics, surgical technique, outcomes, and complications were collected.

Results

Twenty-two articles were included in this review. In total, 228 patients were implanted with a definitive DBS system for pain. The most common targets used were periaqueductal/periventricular gray matter region, ventral posterior lateral/posterior medial thalamus, or both. Poststroke pain, phantom limb pain, and brachial plexus injury were the most common specific indications for DBS. Outcomes varied between studies and across chronic pain diagnoses. Two different groups of investigators targeting the affective sphere of pain have demonstrated improvements in quality of life measures without significant reductions in pain scores.

Conclusion

DBS outcomes for chronic pain are heterogeneous thus far. Future studies may focus on specific pain diagnosis rather than multiple syndromes and consider randomized placebo-controlled designs. DBS targeting the affective sphere of pain seems promising and deserves further investigation.

### Thalamic deep brain stimulation for central poststroke pain syndrome: an international multicenter study [^116UvdiU]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

The effectiveness and optimal stimulation site of deep brain stimulation (DBS) for central poststroke pain (CPSP) remain elusive. The objective of this retrospective international multicenter study was to assess clinical as well as neuroimaging-based predictors of long-term outcomes after DBS for CPSP.

Methods

The authors analyzed patient-based clinical and neuroimaging data of previously published and unpublished cohorts from 6 international DBS centers. DBS leads were reconstructed and normalized. A stimulation map was constructed on the basis of individual stimulation settings and associated outcomes. Furthermore, the authors projected the individual segmented stroke lesions and volumes of tissue activated (VTAs) of the stimulating electrode onto a normalized human connectome to obtain the connectivity profiles of the individual lesions and VTAs.

Results

The authors analyzed the data of 54 patients, of whom 15 were excluded from the final analysis due to a lack of imaging data. Among the remaining 39 patients from 6 different cohorts, the authors found 14 (35.9%) responders who were defined by pain relief of at least 50% at 12-month follow-up. Stimulation mapping identified areas in the posterior limb of the internal capsule, the sensorimotor thalamus, and the medial and intralaminar thalamus as effective for pain reduction. Baseline characteristics did not differ between responders and nonresponders. The stimulation sites of the responders showed significantly reduced structural connectivity to the sensory areas of the cerebral cortex compared to nonresponders.

Conclusions

This comprehensive, multicenter analysis corroborates the efficacy of DBS in treating CPSP for a relevant number of patients. The posterior limb of the internal capsule and the sensorimotor thalamus emerged as potential stimulation sweet spots. The difference in structural connectivity between responders and nonresponders may constitute a biomarker of effective stimulation that can help guide surgical planning in future well-designed prospective trials.

Prognosis

TN is characterised by recurrences and remissions. Many people have periods of remission with no pain lasting months or years but in many, TN becomes more severe and less responsive to treatment over time, despite increasing pharmacological intervention. Most patients with TN are initially managed medically, and at our tertiary referral centre approximately 50% eventually have a surgical procedure.

### Complex regional pain syndrome: practical diagnostic and treatment guidelines, 5th edition [^111GZxe8]. Pain Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Opioids

The earliest known expert opinion regarding opioids in CRPS is that of S. Weir Mitchell, who commented that "for the easing of neurotraumatic pain [referring to "Causalgia" most like CRPS type I] the morphia salts… are invaluable". His description of the relief which the young soldiers he treated obtained is well worth reading, as it also highlights the issues underpinning the opioid crisis: opioids can work extremely well when taken for short periods; yet many problems arise with longer-term treatment (and patients may find it hard to understand why these drugs should not be available to them long-term). However, outside the battlefield, opioids may in fact be less effective even for short term treatment of CRPS. Only one RCT (level 2) has been conducted in CRPS evaluating controlled-release morphine, and reporting no difference in pain reduction when compared to placebo after 8 days' use. This trial would not meet today's quality standards, so the question about short-term efficacy of opioid medication in CRPS remains open. As neuropathic pain does not respond as universally or well as acute nociceptive pain, dose escalation is common, often with no added pain relief but accruing cumulative adverse effects. Patients prescribed 100 mg or more of morphine or equivalent have a 9 times greater risk of serious overdose than patients prescribed less than 20 mg of morphine or equivalent daily, even after adjustment for comorbid conditions. There is growing consensus that while at lower doses opioids are a reasonable 2nd or 3rd line treatment option to try, doses should not be escalated freely. Methadone has theoretical advantages for neuropathic pain because of its putative NMDA antagonism, as well as the practical advantage of low cost. Tramadol may be helpful due to its concomitant serotonin/norepinephrine re-uptake inhibition, a potential advantage shared by tapentadol, a potent opioid with noradrenergic reuptake inhibition. Tolerance and long term toxicity are unresolved issues in CRPS patients for the moment, yet it is worth noting that long-term high-dose opioid use can actually worsen allodynia and/or hyperpathia. Historically, Mitchell commented on tolerance: "When continuously used, it is very curious that its hypnotic manifestations lessen, while its power to abolish pain continues, so that the patient who receives a half grain or more of morphia may become free from pain, and yet walk about with little or no desire to sleep" reminding us that in some cases low dose opioid can be used successfully, chronically. However, in most cases analgesic tolerance co-occurs with "opioid induced hyperalgesia", indistinguishable from symptoms of CRPS. Thus there may be a consideration of the use of short-acting opioids for break-through pain ("rescue" dosing), but this has become controversial. Although occasionally taking an extra pill for a pain spike is unlikely to harm, too many patients end up with daily or near-daily use of "rescue" opioids, obviating their purpose and encouraging tolerance to what is effectively a higher daily dose.

### Ultrasound-guided stellate ganglion block for central post-stroke pain: a case report and review [^112r5ru7]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In the index case, the patient had 5-years of increasing severe and frequent episodes of cramp-like CPSP apparently due to previous hemorrhagic stroke. The pain did not responded to attempted treatments with a variety of pharmacotherapy that included NSAIDs, tramadol, duloxetine and gabapentin. Treatment with ultrasound-guided stellate ganglion block, in contrast, abrogated the pain. Stiffness was also alleviated. It is noteworthy that the pain tin the leg was also abrogated since stellate ganglion block has been typically used to treat reflex sympathetic dystrophy of the arms. This is a successful application of stellate ganglion block in central cramp-like pain.

The neuroanatomy and neurophysiology of thalamus have been extensively studied. Thalamus is a key relay station for the transmission of nociceptive information to the cerebral cortex. However, the mechanism CPSP is unknown. Proposed factors include excessive excitability of the central nervous system, and more specifically, the release of top-down inhibition of the spinal cord due to the loss of sensory afferent neurons.–In addition to the cardinal feature of severe pain, patients often have other less clear symptoms, such as sensory abnormalities and abnormal reflexes.

CPSP is typically refractory to pharmacotherapy. More recently, cortex stimulation and deep brain stimulation have been used to treat CPSP. A case report published 3 years earlier claimed that stellate ganglion block is effective for CPSP. Ultrasound guidance could improve the accuracy of local anesthetic injection into target site. The use of ultrasound-guided in the index case it apparently helpful in achieving therapeutic action.

The cause-effect relationship between stellate ganglion block and pain relief in our patient is apparent based on the temporal event sequence. Reduction in pain intensity and attack frequency is obvious on the second day after the treatment; on the seventh day, the pain completely disappeared. The diagnosis of CPSP, however, is completely based on the history of stroke and the development of increasingly severe cramp-like pain 5 years later and not by a thorough neurological and electrophysiological investigation. Also, whether repeated injection of lidocaine is necessary is unknown. Future studies, ideally randomized controlled trials, are needed to verify the efficacy and to examine the potential harm.

### Practice parameter: the diagnostic evaluation and treatment of trigeminal neuralgia (an evidence-based review): report of the quality standards subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology and the European Federation of Neurological Societies [^115d7psw]. Neurology (2008). Medium credibility.

Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) — diagnostic and treatment recommendations: For patients with TN, routine imaging may be considered to identify STN (Level C). The presence of trigeminal sensory deficits or bilateral involvement of the trigeminal nerves should be considered useful to identify patients with STN; however, because of poor specificity, the absence of these features is not useful for excluding STN (Level B). Measuring trigeminal reflexes in a qualified electrophysiologic laboratory should be considered useful for distinguishing STN from CTN (Level B). Younger age at onset, involvement of the first division of the trigeminal nerve, unresponsiveness to treatment, and abnormal trigeminal evoked potentials should be disregarded as useful for accurately identifying patients with STN (Level B). To control pain in patients with TN: carbamazepine should be offered (Level A), oxcarbazepine should be considered (Level B), baclofen, lamotrigine, and pimozide may be considered (Level C), and topical ophthalmic anesthesia should not be considered (Level B). For patients with TN refractory to medical therapy: early surgical therapy may be considered (Level C), and percutaneous procedures on the Gasserian ganglion, gamma knife, and microvascular decompression may be considered (Level C).

### Post-stroke pain case study: clinical characteristics, therapeutic options and long-term follow-up [^117RvMmF]. European Journal of Neurology (2004). Low credibility.

Central post-stroke pain (CPSP) is a syndrome characterized by sensory disturbances and neuropathic pain. In 40%-60% of CPSP patients, the onset of central pain following a stroke occurs more than 1 month after the stroke, creating a source of diagnostic uncertainty or significant delay in treatment since healthcare providers familiar with CPSP may no longer be caring for the patient when the symptoms occur. In addition to chronic pain, the presence of somatosensory abnormalities is the most important diagnostic corollary of CPSP. Neuropathic or central pain has been estimated to occur in up to 8% of patients after a stroke, and about 18% of stroke patients with a somatosensory disturbance will develop CPSP. Although largely a matter of conjecture, it is generally agreed that damage to spinothalamic sensory pathways plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of CPSP. A comprehensive examination of the patient for sensory deficits is essential before treatment can be initiated. Functional disturbances such as depression, anxiety and sleep disturbances are significant comorbid conditions associated with CPSP; the physician should incorporate an assessment of these potential comorbidities into the examination. Treatment options for CPSP are limited; at present, amitriptyline is the drug of first choice. Other drugs including antidepressants, anticonvulsants, antiarrhythmics, opioids and N-methyl-d-aspartate antagonists may provide relief for some patients who do not respond to amitriptyline. Included in this review is a case study outlining the challenges of managing the patient with CPSP.

### Trigeminal neuralgia: current approaches and emerging interventions [^113rBajx]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

This review broadly summarizes over 150 years of collective clinical experience in the treatment of trigeminal neuralgia. What is increasingly clear is that there is no catch-all medical or surgical intervention that is effective for all patients with trigeminal neuralgia, likely reflective of the fact that TN is likely a heterogenous group of disorders that jointly manifests in facial pain. The first-line treatment for TN remains anticonvulsants due to a long history of use and relatively tolerable side-effects. Patients who fail medical therapy have a range of surgical options available to them. In general, microvascular decompression is a safe and effective procedure with immediate and durable outcomes. Patients who are unable to tolerate general anesthesia or whose medical comorbidities preclude a suboccipital craniectomy may benefit from percutaneous methodologies including glycerin or radiofrequency ablation, or both. For patients with iatrogenic bleeding diathesis due to blood thinning medications who are otherwise ineligible for any type of invasive procedures, or for those who are unwilling to undergo surgically invasive procedures, radiosurgery may be an excellent option — provided the patient is counseled ahead of time that maximum pain relief will take on the order of months to achieve. Finally, peripheral neurectomies continue to provide an inexpensive and resource-sparing alternative to pain relief for a majority of patients in geographic locations with limited economic and medical resources. Ultimately, elucidation of the molecular mechanisms underlying trigeminal neuralgia will pave the way for novel, more effective and less invasive therapies.

### Prior-guided individualized thalamic parcellation based on local diffusion characteristics [^114yXa2m]. Human Brain Mapping (2024). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

The dorsal thalamus, commonly referred to as the thalamus, constitutes the largest part of the diencephalon and can be broadly divided into anterior, lateral, and medial nuclei by the internal medullary laminae. These nuclei exhibit not only structural differentiation but also fulfill distinct functions (Jankowski et al; Watanabe & Funahashi). They have been identified as selectively vulnerable to specific pathological conditions (Braak & Braak). Specific thalamic nuclei serve as neuromodulation targets for nervous system diseases (Whiting et al.). For instance, deep brain stimulation of the ventral intermediate nucleus has proven effective in inhibiting essential tremors (Benabid et al.), while the anterior thalamic nucleus is a targeted intervention for intractable epilepsy (Krishna et al; Kundu et al.). The ventral posterolateral nucleus is a therapeutic target for alleviating neuropathic pain (Abreu et al.), and the centromedian‐parafascicular‐complex is involved with consciousness recovery after severe traumatic brain injury (Schiff et al.) and treatment of Tourette Syndrome (Baldermann et al.). Nevertheless, the therapeutic response varies among patients, suggesting that the thalamic structure of each individual possesses additional, yet unidentified, particular specificity.

### Management of central poststroke pain: systematic review of randomized controlled trials [^113MphAd]. Stroke (2015). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Central poststroke pain is a chronic neuropathic disorder that follows a stroke. Current research on its management is limited, and no review has evaluated all therapies for central poststroke pain.

Methods

We conducted a systematic review of randomized controlled trials to evaluate therapies for central poststroke pain. We identified eligible trials, in any language, by systematic searches of AMED, CENTRAL, CINAHL, DARE, EMBASE, HealthSTAR, MEDLINE, and PsychINFO. Eligible trials (1) enrolled ≥ 10 patients with central poststroke pain; (2) randomly assigned them to an active therapy or a control arm; and (3) collected outcome data ≥ 14 days after treatment. Pairs of reviewers, independently and in duplicate, screened titles and abstracts of identified citations, reviewed full texts of potentially eligible trials, and extracted information from eligible studies. We used a modified Cochrane tool to evaluate risk of bias of eligible studies, and collected patient-important outcomes according to recommendations by the Initiative on Methods, Measurement, and Pain Assessment in Clinical Trials. We conducted, when possible, random effects meta-analyses, and evaluated our certainty in treatment effects using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation System.

Results

Eight eligible English language randomized controlled trials (459 patients) tested anticonvulsants, an antidepressant, an opioid antagonist, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, and acupuncture. Results suggested that all therapies had little to no effect on pain and other patient-important outcomes. Our certainty in the treatment estimates ranged from very low to low.

Conclusions

Our findings are inconsistent with major clinical practice guidelines; the available evidence suggests no beneficial effects of any therapies that researchers have evaluated in randomized controlled trials.

### Medial thalamotomy using stereotactic radiosurgery for intractable pain: a systematic review [^112JEhVz]. Neurosurgical Review (2022). Medium credibility.

Medial thalamotomy using stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is a potential treatment for intractable pain. However, the ideal treatment parameters and expected outcomes from this procedure remain unclear. The aim of this systematic review is to provide further insights on medial thalamotomy using SRS, specifically for intractable pain. A systematic review was performed to identify all clinical articles discussing medial thalamotomy using SRS for intractable pain. Only studies in which SRS was used to target the medial thalamus for pain were included. For centers with multiple publications, care was taken to avoid recounting individual patients. The literature review revealed six studies describing outcomes of medial thalamotomy using SRS for a total of 125 patients (118 included in the outcome analysis). Fifty-two patients were treated for cancer pain across three studies, whereas five studies included 73 patients who were treated for nonmalignant pain. The individual studies demonstrated initial meaningful pain reduction in 43.3–100% of patients, with an aggregate initial meaningful pain reduction in 65 patients (55%) following SRS medial thalamotomy. This effect persisted in 45 patients (38%) at the last follow-up. Adverse events were observed in six patients (5%), which were related to radiation in five patients (4%). Medial thalamotomy using SRS is effective for select patients with treatment-resistant pain and is remarkably safe when modern radiation delivery platforms are used. More posteriorly placed lesions within the medial thalamus were associated with better pain relief. More studies are warranted to shed light on differences in patient responses.

### Trigeminal neuralgia: current approaches and emerging interventions [^1119Hya7]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) has been described in the literature as one of the most debilitating presentations of orofacial pain. This review summarizes over 150 years of collective clinical experience in the medical and surgical treatment of TN. Fundamentally, TN remains a clinical diagnosis that must be distinguished from other types of trigeminal neuropathic pain and/or facial pain associated with other neuralgias or headache syndromes. What is increasingly clear is that there is no catch-all medical or surgical intervention that is effective for all patients with trigeminal neuralgia, likely reflective of the fact that TN is likely a heterogenous group of disorders that jointly manifests in facial pain. The first-line treatment for TN remains anticonvulsant medical therapy. Patients who fail this have a range of surgical options available to them. In general, microvascular decompression is a safe and effective procedure with immediate and durable outcomes. Patients who are unable to tolerate general anesthesia or whose medical comorbidities preclude a suboccipital craniectomy may benefit from percutaneous methodologies including glycerol or radiofrequency ablation, or both. For patients with bleeding diathesis due to blood thinning medications who are ineligible for invasive procedures, or for those who are unwilling to undergo open surgical procedures, radiosurgery may be an excellent option — provided the patient understands that maximum pain relief will take on the order of months to achieve. Finally, peripheral neurectomies continue to provide an inexpensive and resource-sparing alternative to pain relief for patients in locations with limited economic and medical resources. Ultimately, elucidation of the molecular mechanisms underlying trigeminal neuralgia will pave the way for novel, more effective and less invasive therapies.

### Trigeminal neuralgia [^1138rwFB]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2014). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Trigeminal neuralgia is a sudden, unilateral, brief, stabbing, recurrent pain in the distribution of one or more branches of the fifth cranial nerve. Pain occurs in paroxysms, which can last from a few seconds to several minutes. The frequency of the paroxysms ranges from a few to hundreds of attacks a day. Periods of remission can last for months to years, but tend to shorten over time. The condition can impair activities of daily living and lead to depression.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of ongoing treatments in people with trigeminal neuralgia? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to September 2013 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found seven studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: baclofen; carbamazepine; gabapentin; lamotrigine; oxcarbazepine; microvascular decompression; and destructive neurosurgical techniques (radiofrequency thermocoagulation, glycerol rhizolysis, balloon compression, and stereotactic radiosurgery).

Augmentation of Monoamines

Tricyclic and heterocyclic drugs that augment descending inhibition by blocking presynaptic re-uptake of monoaminergic neurotransmitters (particularly norepinephrine) are unsurpassed in efficacy for neuralgia. Although originally approved for depression (and anxiety), this indication has been supplanted in our patients by use for neuropathic pain. The antidepressant (and anti-insomnia) efficacy of these compounds provides additional benefit for many patients. These are "dirty drugs" with multiple mechanisms including peripheral sodium-channel blockade, which may in fact contribute to efficacy. Their once-daily dosing (preferably with the sedative versions at night) and low cost are added advantages.

A first-line option for neuropathic conditions and headache (level 2 evidence) tricyclic/heterocyclic antidepressants (HCAs) are used exclusively as prophylactic agents. Meta-analyses of RCTs support their efficacy for neuropathic pain (level 1). One study reported that, for every 100 patients with neuropathic pain taking antidepressants, 30 would obtain at least 50% pain relief (i.e. Number Needed to Treat [NNT] of 3. This is unsurpassed by any other treatment for neuropathic pain; however it is worth noting that all of these previous trials have durations of only weeks to a few months, and in clinical practice many patients may eventually develop tolerance or tachyphylaxis to these drugs. The development of tolerance is less of a challenge in early CRPS where most patients may eventually improve in any case. In established and persistent CRPS, to delay tolerance development some clinicians suggest it is worth considering prescribing these drugs PRN, i.e. aiming primarily to achieve sleep-induction on difficult days.

### Update on treating painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy: a review of current US guidelines with a focus on the most recently approved management options [^1143qxYs]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

The pathogenesis of pain related to DPN is not fully understood, although several theories have been proposed. These include changes in blood vessels that supply the peripheral nerves; metabolic and autoimmune disorders accompanied by glial cell activation; alterations in sodium and calcium channel expression; and, more recently, central pain mechanisms, such as increased thalamic vascularity and imbalance of the facilitatory/inhibitory descending pathways.

The management of painful DPN involves treating the underlying causes via lifestyle modifications and pharmacological control of risk factors, targeting its pathogenesis, and providing symptomatic pain relief, thereby improving patient function and health-related quality of life (HR-QoL). Despite the substantial morbidity of painful DPN, its negative impact on HR-QoL, and immense healthcare burden, the condition is often misdiagnosed and inadequately treated.

Since 2020, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved two novel options to manage painful DPN, namely the capsaicin 8% topical system and spinal cord stimulation devices. As such, we considered it timely to examine the evidence supporting the use of these newer options and their positioning within current US guidelines. We also present evidence for three FDA-approved oral pharmacological treatments and other guideline-supported oral treatments commonly used as first-line options in clinical practice; explore potential future options to manage painful DPN; and discuss the unmet needs of this increasingly complex and rapidly growing patient population.

### Central neuropathic pain [^113mYa1A]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2023). High credibility.

Central neuropathic pain arises from a lesion or disease of the central somatosensory nervous system such as brain injury, spinal cord injury, stroke, multiple sclerosis or related neuroinflammatory conditions. The incidence of central neuropathic pain differs based on its underlying cause. Individuals with spinal cord injury are at the highest risk; however, central post-stroke pain is the most prevalent form of central neuropathic pain worldwide. The mechanisms that underlie central neuropathic pain are not fully understood, but the pathophysiology likely involves intricate interactions and maladaptive plasticity within spinal circuits and brain circuits associated with nociception and antinociception coupled with neuronal hyperexcitability. Modulation of neuronal activity, neuron-glia and neuro-immune interactions and targeting pain-related alterations in brain connectivity, represent potential therapeutic approaches. Current evidence-based pharmacological treatments include antidepressants and gabapentinoids as first-line options. Non-pharmacological pain management options include self-management strategies, exercise and neuromodulation. A comprehensive pain history and clinical examination form the foundation of central neuropathic pain classification, identification of potential risk factors and stratification of patients for clinical trials. Advanced neurophysiological and neuroimaging techniques hold promise to improve the understanding of mechanisms that underlie central neuropathic pain and as predictive biomarkers of treatment outcome.

### Neurostimulation for chronic noncancer pain: an evaluation of the clinical evidence and recommendations for future trial designs [^113jJy5U]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2006). Low credibility.

Object

Neurostimulation to treat chronic pain includes approved and investigational therapies directed at the spinal cord, thalamus, periaqueductal or periventricular gray matter, motor cortex, and peripheral nerves. Persistent pain after surgery and work-related or neural injuries are common indications for such treatments. In light of the risks, efforts, costs, and expectations associated with neurostimulation therapies, a careful reexamination of the methods used to gather evidence for this treatment's long-term efficacy is in order.

Methods

The authors combed English-language publications to determine the nature of the evidence supporting the efficacy of neurostimulation therapies for chronic noncancer pain. To formulate recommendations for the design of future studies, the results of their analysis were compared with established guidelines for the evaluation of medical evidence. Evidence supporting the efficacy of neurostimulation has been collected predominantly from retrospective series or from prospective studies whose design or methods of analysis make them subject to limited interpretation. To date, there has been no successful clinical study focused on establishing the efficacy of neurostimulation for pain and incorporating sufficient numbers of participants, matched control groups, sham stimulation, randomization, prospectively defined end points, and methods for controlling experimental bias. Currently available data provide little support for the common practices of psychological or pharmacological screening or trial stimulation to predict and/or improve long-term results.

Conclusions

These findings do not diminish the value of previous investigations or positive patient experiences and do not mean that the treatments are ineffective; rather, they reveal that new data are required to answer the questions raised in and by previous study data. Future analyses of emerging neurostimulation modalities for pain should, whenever feasible, require unambiguous diagnoses as an entry criterion and should involve the use of randomization, parallel control groups that receive sham stimulation, and blinding of patients, investigators, and device programmers. Given the chronicity of patient symptoms and stimulation therapies, efficacy should be studied for 1 year or longer after device implantation. Meticulous study methods are especially important to evaluate new therapies like motor cortex and occipital nerve stimulation.

### Trigeminal neuralgia: current approaches and emerging interventions [^116uH2hP]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) has been described in the literature as one of the most debilitating presentations of orofacial pain. This review summarizes over 150 years of collective clinical experience in the medical and surgical treatment of TN. Fundamentally, TN remains a clinical diagnosis that must be distinguished from other types of trigeminal neuropathic pain and/or facial pain associated with other neuralgias or headache syndromes. What is increasingly clear is that there is no catch-all medical or surgical intervention that is effective for all patients with trigeminal neuralgia, likely reflective of the fact that TN is likely a heterogenous group of disorders that jointly manifests in facial pain. The first-line treatment for TN remains anticonvulsant medical therapy. Patients who fail this have a range of surgical options available to them. In general, microvascular decompression is a safe and effective procedure with immediate and durable outcomes. Patients who are unable to tolerate general anesthesia or whose medical comorbidities preclude a suboccipital craniectomy may benefit from percutaneous methodologies including glycerol or radiofrequency ablation, or both. For patients with bleeding diathesis due to blood thinning medications who are ineligible for invasive procedures, or for those who are unwilling to undergo open surgical procedures, radiosurgery may be an excellent option-provided the patient understands that maximum pain relief will take on the order of months to achieve. Finally, peripheral neurectomies continue to provide an inexpensive and resource-sparing alternative to pain relief for patients in locations with limited economic and medical resources. Ultimately, elucidation of the molecular mechanisms underlying trigeminal neuralgia will pave the way for novel, more effective and less invasive therapies.

### Advances in neuropathic pain… [^114Q2wg8]. JAMA Network (2003). Excellent credibility.

Chronic neuropathic pain, caused by lesions in the peripheral or central nervous system, comes in many forms. We describe current approaches to the diagnosis and assessment of neuropathic pain and discuss the results of recent research on its pathophysiologic mechanisms. Randomized controlled clinical trials of gabapentin, the 5% lidocaine patch, opioid analgesics, tramadol hydrochloride, and tricyclic antidepressants provide an evidence-based approach to the treatment of neuropathic pain, and specific recommendations are presented for use of these medications. Most randomized controlled trials of chronic neuropathic pain have examined only 2 pain syndromes, PDN and PHN. Moreover, the US Food and Drug Administration has approved medications for the treatment of only 2 specific neuropathic pain syndromes: trigeminal neuralgia and PHN.

Third, distinct treatment guidelines for tic douloureux emphasize carbamazepine, phenytoin, and baclofen. 30 Fourth, we acknowledge that pharmacologic management is not a cure and should be considered an integral component of a more comprehensive approach to treatment. A discussion of the many widely used nonpharmacologic approaches including physical therapy, psychological treatments, invasive procedures, and various complementary and alternative medicine interventions is beyond the scope of this review. First-line Medications. The efficacy of gabapentin, the 5% lidocaine patch, opioid analgesics, tramadol hydrochloride, and tricyclic antidepressants has been consistently demonstrated in multiple randomized controlled trials. Each one can be used as an initial treatment for neuropathic pain in certain clinical circumstances.

Opioid analgesics and TCAs generally require greater caution than the other options. For each of these 5 medications, brief reviews of the relevant randomized clinical trials and specific treatment recommendations follow. Treatment recommendations are summarized in Table 2. In a unique 3-period crossover study comparing treatment with opioid analgesics, TCAs, and placebo in patients with PHN, controlled-release morphine sulfate titrated to a maximum dosage of 240 mg/d provided statistically significant benefits for pain and sleep but not for physical function and mood. 45 In that trial, patients preferred treatment with opioid analgesics compared with TCAs and placebo despite a greater incidence of adverse effects and more dropouts during opioid treatment.

### Complex regional pain syndrome: practical diagnostic and treatment guidelines, 5th edition [^112e8fP9]. Pain Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

General Considerations

To help avoid unrealistic expectations, patients should be told that while there is no treatment proven to cure CRPS or reduce symptoms in all patients, the drugs that patients will receive during their treatment have been shown to help with CRPS for some patients.
Recognize that CRPS may be more than just a single unitary condition. Early CRPS (up to 6–18 months duration) can respond differently to interventions than persistent CRPS. Importantly, patients diagnosed with early CRPS likely will naturally improve and drugs or nerve-blocks that are effective even for only a few months may bridge the time to natural recovery. Approximately 15% of early CRPS patients fail to recover, and an early cold limb may be a poor prognostic sign.
Understand that most patients will over time develop analgesic tolerance to available drugs whereas side effects often continue.
Available drugs are not thought to "cure" the condition.
Monotherapy is best, to minimize adverse effects, cost, and patient non-compliance, but rational polypharmacy is often needed, particularly to address the various CRPS symptoms (and disease subtypes). This of course should comprise rational combinations of different classes of medications rather than multiple medications from the same class.
The choice of medications should include cost considerations and other patient needs.
Drugs that simultaneously treat multiple symptoms are desirable, for example, tricyclic antidepressants are relatively effective in RCTs for relieving neuralgic pain and also effective for anxiety, depression, and insomnia.
Traditionally, as needed (PRN) drug intake was considered inferior to scheduled drug intake. However, recognition that patients often develop tolerance to regular analgesic drug intake has changed this consideration somewhat. Some patients may benefit from taking certain drugs as and when required, for example after a bad day, or in anticipation of a difficult night. More research is needed to clarify this question.
Reasonable treatment outcomes should be agreed upon in partnership with the patient before treatment starts (e.g. a pain reduction of two points on a 0–10 scale, improvement in specific functional activities). If these targets are not achieved, or if initial beneficial effects later lessen, the drug treatment should then be reconsidered.

### Gamma knife surgery targeting the centromedian nucleus of the thalamus for the palliative management of thalamic pain: durable response in stroke-induced thalamic pain syndrome [^114vmF4J]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2006). Low credibility.

The authors report the neuroimaging features, treatment planning, and outcome in a case of radiosurgical thalamotomy targeting the centromedian nucleus (CMN) for stroke-induced thalamic pain. A 79-year-old man, with embolic occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery and large hemispheric infarction involving the thalamus, suffered a right hemiplegia and expressive aphasia. One year poststroke, severe right-sided facial, scalp, arm, and trunk pain developed and was exacerbated by any tactile contact. Medical treatment had failed. Medical illness, including mandatory anticoagulation therapy for atrial fibrillation, precluded surgical procedures. Minimally invasive radiosurgery was offered as an alternative. Magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography were used to localize the left CMN. A single shot of 140 Gy was delivered to the 100% isodose line by using the 4-mm collimator helmet. The patient was evaluated at regular intervals. By 12 weeks posttreatment, he had significant improvements in pain control and his ability to tolerate physical contact during activities of daily living. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated baseline encephalomalacia from his prior stroke, and signal changes in the left CMN consistent with gamma irradiation-based thalamotomy. Currently, nearly 7 years after radiosurgery, he continues to enjoy a marked reduction in pain without the need of analgesic medications. Thalamic pain syndrome is generally refractory to conventional treatment. Neurosurgical interventions provide modest benefit and carry associated risks of invasive surgery and anesthesia. The CMN is readily localized with neuroimaging and is an approximate target to reduce the suffering aspect of pain. In this case, radiosurgery was a safe and effective treatment, providing durable symptom control and improved quality of life.

### Practice parameter: the diagnostic evaluation and treatment of trigeminal neuralgia (an evidence-based review): report of the quality standards subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology and the European Federation of Neurological Societies [^113g6uuc]. Neurology (2008). Medium credibility.

Trigeminal neuralgia definition and incidence — population context: The International Association for the Study of Pain defines TN as sudden, usually unilateral, severe, brief, stabbing, recurrent episodes of pain in the distribution of one or more branches of the trigeminal nerve. The annual incidence of TN is 4 to 5 in 100,000. The latest classification of the International Headache Society distinguishes between classic and symptomatic TN, and classic TN includes all cases without an established etiology (i.e., idiopathic), as well as those with potential vascular compression of the fifth cranial nerve.

### Invasive brain stimulation for the treatment of neuropathic pain [^113A6tkL]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2011). Medium credibility.

Neurostimulation therapy is indicated for neuropathic pain that is refractory to medical treatment, and includes stimulation of the dorsal spinal cord, deep brain structures, and the precentral motor cortex. Spinal cord stimulation is validated in the treatment of selected types of chronic pain syndromes, such as failed back surgery syndrome. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has shown promise as a treatment for peripheral neuropathic pain and phantom limb pain. Compared with DBS, motor cortex stimulation (MCS) is currently more frequently used, mainly because it is more easily performed, and has a wider range of indications (including central poststroke pain). Controlled trials have demonstrated the efficacy of MCS in the treatment of various types of neuropathic pain, although these trials included a limited number of patients and need to be confirmed by large, controlled, multicenter studies. Despite technical progress in neurosurgical navigation, results from studies of MCS are variable, and validated criteria for selecting good candidates for implantation are lacking. However, the evidence in favor of MCS is sufficient to include it in the range of therapeutic options for refractory neuropathic pain. In this Review, the respective efficacies and mechanisms of action of DBS and MCS are discussed.

### Practice parameter: the diagnostic evaluation and treatment of trigeminal neuralgia (an evidence-based review): report of the quality standards subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology and the European Federation of Neurological Societies [^115Vk6Ri]. Neurology (2008). Medium credibility.

Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) — first-line pharmacotherapy and evidence gaps: The two drugs to consider as first-line therapy in TN are carbamazepine (CBZ) (200–1,200 mg/day) and oxcarbazepine (OXC) (600–1,800 mg/day). Although the evidence for CBZ is stronger than for OXC, the latter may pose fewer safety concerns. There is little evidence to guide the clinician after the treatment of patients with TN who fail first-line therapy, the effect of other drugs commonly used in neuropathic pain is unknown, and there are no published studies directly comparing polytherapy with monotherapy.

### Pharmacologic management of neuropathic pain [^116Gmz67]. Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

This article aims to provide the practitioner with therapeutic options to treat a broad spectrum of acute and chronic orofacial pain syndromes. The focus will be nonsurgical that the oral health care physician can implement to treat this population of patients. The World Health Organization estimated that more than 1 in every 3 people suffers from acute or chronic pain. This article is primarily devoted to medication management once the diagnosis of neuropathic pain, a true trigeminal neuralgia, or a variant of trigeminal neuralgia often referred to as traumatic neuropathic pain or traumatic trigeminal neuralgia.

### Disappearance of central thalamic pain syndrome after contralateral parietal lobe lesion: implications for therapeutic brain stimulation [^112eMnKN]. Pain (2002). Low credibility.

At present there is hardly any appropriate therapy for central pain syndromes available. We report on a unique case of a central thalamic pain syndrome that did not respond to any therapy but disappeared after an additional contralateral parietal lobe lesion. This example indicates that lesions affecting the bilateral balance of thalamo-parietal circuits may lead to pain relief in patients with central pain syndrome, which probably constitutes a bilateral disorder of functional plasticity. This should be taken into account in chronic brain stimulation for persistent pain states.

### Central post-stroke pain syndrome: yet another use for gabapentin? [^112TcPqC]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2002). Low credibility.

Although gabapentin was originally developed for treating partial seizures, it has been used mainly to treat various peripheral neuropathic pain conditions; however, there is very limited experience with gabapentin for the treatment of pain conditions of the central nervous system like central post-stroke pain syndrome. We report the case of a 45-yr old man with central post-stroke pain syndrome who failed to respond to a variety of oral analgesics, but within 2 wk of the inception of gabapentin therapy, his average pain was significantly reduced and his level of function improved. We conclude that gabapentin may be an effective medication for the treatment of central post-stroke pain syndrome.

### Tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabidiol as an oromucosal spray in a 1: 1 ratio: a therapeutic option for patients with central post-stroke pain syndrome? [^1138DvmY]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Central pain after stroke due to brainstem infarction is very rare. Treatment is difficult and specific guidelines are lacking. This is the report of a 61-year-old female patient who, after a posterolateral left medulla oblongata insult with incomplete Wallenberg syndrome, subsequently developed a burning and tingling pain in the contralateral leg and a burning and shooting pain in the ipsilateral face in trigeminal branches 1 and 2. More than 3years of therapy with amitriptyline, gabapentin, pregabalin and various grade II and III opioids was ineffective or showed intolerable side effects. The administration of tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabidiol as an oromucosal spray in a 1:1 ratio improved the pain situation and quality of life quickly and permanently. The encouraging results in the present case may suggest that treatment with medical cannabis should be considered in similar cases when standard therapies are insufficient.

### Bilateral focused ultrasound medial thalamotomies for trigeminal neuropathic pain: a randomized controlled study [^116ezUwH]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

Medial thalamotomy has been shown to benefit patients with neuropathic pain, but widespread adoption of this procedure has been limited by reporting of clinical outcomes in studies without a control group. This study aimed to minimize confounders associated with medial thalamotomy for treating chronic pain by using modern MRI-guided stereotactic lesioning and a rigorous clinical design.

Methods

This prospective, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial in 10 patients with trigeminal neuropathic pain used sham procedures as controls. Participants underwent assessments by a pain psychologist and pain management clinician, including use of the following measures: the Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS); patient-reported outcome measures; and patient's impression of improvement at baseline, 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months postprocedure. Patients in the treated group underwent bilateral focused ultrasound (FUS) medial thalamotomy targeting the central lateral nucleus. Patients in the control group underwent sham procedures with energy output disabled. The primary efficacy outcome measure was between-group differences in pain intensity (using the NPRS) at baseline and at 3 months postprocedure. Adverse events were measured for safety and included MRI analysis. Exploratory measures of connectivity and metabolism were analyzed using diffusion tensor imaging, functional MRI, and PET, respectively.

Results

There were no serious complications from the FUS procedures. MRI confirmed bilateral medial thalamic ablations. There was no significant improvement in pain intensity from baseline to 3 months, either for patients undergoing FUS medial thalamotomy or for sham controls; and the between-group change in NPRS score as the primary efficacy outcome measure was not significantly different. Patient-reported outcome assessments demonstrated improvement (i.e., a decrease) only in pain interference with enjoyment of life at 3 months. There was a perception of benefit at 1 week, but only for patients treated with FUS and not for the sham cohort. Advanced neuroimaging showed that these medial thalamic lesions altered structural connectivity with the postcentral gyrus and demonstrated a trend toward hypometabolism in the insula and amygdala.

Conclusions

This randomized controlled trial of bilateral FUS medial thalamotomy did not reduce the intensity of trigeminal neuropathic pain, although it should be noted that the ability to estimate the magnitude of treatment effects is limited by the small cohort.

### Practice parameter: the diagnostic evaluation and treatment of trigeminal neuralgia (an evidence-based review): report of the quality standards subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology and the European Federation of Neurological Societies [^113AaNGb]. Neurology (2008). Medium credibility.

Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) research priorities emphasize that the efficacy of new drugs and, in particular, surgical interventions, needs to be determined in well- designed RCTs, and that randomized treatment allocation and independent outcome assessment would go a long way to establish the efficacy of the surgical techniques. Surgical comparison is proposed to be answered with a prospective study comparing long- term outcomes in patients with TN undergoing microvascular decompression with and without neurovascular contact identified on preoperative high-resolution MRI. The optimal timing of surgical referral remains a crucial question, including the clinical uncertainties "How many different drugs should be tried before referring a patient for surgery?" and "What is the likelihood that a patient with TN failing OXC or CBZ will respond to alternative drugs?", which could be answered by a large prospective cohort survey of patients with TN treated in a standardized, stepwise fashion.

### Modulating the pain network – neurostimulation for central poststroke pain [^113ad1jh]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2015). Medium credibility.

Central poststroke pain (CPSP) is one of the most under-recognized consequences of stroke, occurring in up to 10% of patients, and is also one of the most difficult to treat. The condition characteristically develops after selective lesions to the spinothalamic system, most often to the ventral posterior thalamus. Here, we suggest that CPSP is best characterized as a disorder of brain network reorganization, and that this characterization offers insight into the inadequacy of most current pharmacological treatments. Accordingly, we review the progress in identification of nonpharmacological treatments, which could ultimately lead to mechanism-based therapeutics. Of the invasive neurostimulation treatments available, electrical motor cortex stimulation seems to be superior to deep brain stimulation of the thalamus or brainstem, but enthusiasm for clinical use of the procedure is limited by its invasiveness. The current preference is for noninvasive transcranial magnetic stimulation, which, though effective, requires repeated application, causing logistical difficulties. Although CPSP is often severe and remains difficult to treat, future characterization of the precise underlying neurophysiological mechanisms, together with technological innovation, should allow new treatments to evolve.

### Ultrasound-guided stellate ganglion block for central post-stroke pain: a case report and review [^111vokRz]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Central post-stroke pain (CPSP) is the central equivalent of peripheral neuropathic pain. The incidence of CPSP after stroke is unknown, but has been estimated at 1–12%.–CPSP typically develops in the sub-acute or chronic stages of ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke. CPSP was originally referred to as Dejerine-Roussy syndrome, and later as thalamic pain syndrome. Since brain sites other than the thalamus (for example, medulla oblongata), the current formal term is CPSP.CPSP is typically refractory to pharmacotherapy (NSAIDs, opioids, antidepressants, and anticonvulsants). More recent treatment options included stereotaxic irradiation of the pituitary with γ-irradiation, trans-cranial cortex stimulation and deep brain stimulation.–Stellate ganglion block is a method to treat reflex sympathetic dystrophy, and was reported to be effective for thalamic pain in a case report in 2007. We now report a case of successful treatment of cramp-like pain after thalamic hemorrhage using ultrasound-guided stellate ganglion block.

Written informed consent has been provided by the patient to have the case details and accompanying images published.

### Role of sensory pathway injury in central post-stroke pain: a narrative review of its pathogenetic mechanism [^111h6fAT]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Central neuropathic pain commonly includes pain caused by central post-stroke pain (CPSP), spinal cord injury, and multiple sclerosis. Stroke is one of the most common causes of disability and the second most common cause of death worldwide. The global burden of stroke is increasing as the population ages.CPSP is a known complication during stroke rehabilitation. Stroke patients often suffer from different forms of chronic pain, commonly in the form of CPSP, shoulder pain, painful spasticity. In 1906, Dejerine and Roussy first described a case of severe and persistent lateralized pain after a thalamic stroke; this pain syndrome was later named as the Dejerine–Roussy syndrome. Because central pain also occurs due to vascular lesions in the central nervous system other than the thalamus, the term CPSP is not limited to only thalamic strokes but tends to describe neuropathic pain that occurs after cerebral ischemic or hemorrhagic strokes. At present, there is no stipulated definition for the diverse clinical manifestations of CPSP. The pain can be described as persistent pain such as "burning", "pricking", "freezing", and "squeezing", intermittent pain such as "tearing" or "shooting". CPSP is not easily distinguished from post-stroke peripheral musculoskeletal pain and is easily overlooked in clinical practice, which may delay the recovery process and reduce the quality of life. Moreover, this kind of pain responds poorly to common anti-neuralgic drugs and lasts for a prolonged time; this not only drastically affects the quality of life in the recovery period after stroke, but also has an effect on individuals' psychological health, resulting in anxiety, depression, and sleep disorders. Therefore, in order to develop more effective treatments for CPSP, it is important to review the possible mechanisms of CPSP occurrence.

### Central poststroke pain: a review of pathophysiology and treatment [^114g3VHG]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Central poststroke pain (CPSP) is a disabling morbidity occurring in 8%-14% of patients with stroke. It is infrequently recognized and difficult to manage.

Objective

We systematically reviewed the pathophysiology and treatment of CPSP.

Methods

We conducted a Medline search using the key words "central post-stroke pain", "post-stroke pain", "CPSP and basic studies", "CPSP and clinical features", "CPSP and pharmacological treatment", "CPSP and nonpharmacological treatment" and "CPSP and treatment guideline". The articles related to CPSP were categorized into clinical features, pathophysiology and treatment, and then systematically reviewed.

Results

Stroke along the spinothalamocortical pathway may result in CPSP after a variable period, usually after 1–2 mo. CPSP may be spontaneous or evoked, variable in intensity and quality. It tends to improve with time. CPSP is associated with mild motor symptoms with relative sparing of joint position and vibration sensations. The pathophysiology of CPSP is not well understood, but central disinhibition, imbalance of stimuli and central sensitization have been suggested. There are few class I and class II studies regarding its management. Amitriptyline and lamotrigine (class IIB) are recommended as first-line and mexiletine, fluvoxamine and gabapentin as second-line drugs. In pharmacoresistant patients, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation and deep brain stimulation have been beneficial.

Conclusions

CPSP patients present with diverse sensory symptoms and its pathophysiology is still poorly understood. Amitriptyline and lamotrigine are effective treatments. Further studies are needed to understand the pathophysiology and investigate newer therapeutic modalities.

### Trigeminal neuralgia associated with a solitary pontine lesion: clinical and neuroimaging definition of a new syndrome [^112mDkyf]. Pain (2020). Medium credibility.

4. Discussion

This study defines the new clinical syndrome of SPL-TN using a clinical and neuroimaging approach. Patients with SPL-TN have clinical features that are identical to TN but have a single pontine lesion not in keeping with MS. The definition of this syndrome and differentiation from other known types of TN are important as these patients are overwhelmingly nonresponders to surgical treatment. The lesions are uniformly distributed along the affected trigeminal pontine pathway, where the greatest lesion overlap across patients is in the area of the VBSNC. Diffusion tensor imaging analyses of the SPL-TN lesions demonstrate abnormal white-matter microstructure, characterized by lower FA, and higher MD, RD, and AD compared with the unaffected side. Furthermore, the brainstem trigeminal fiber microstructure within a lesion, but not the whole lesion itself, highlights the difference between SPL-TN and MS-TN patients. Thus, although conventional MRI cannot directly distinguish MS plaques from SPL-TN lesions, DTI may be capable of anatomically differentiating the 2 when a tract-restricted approach is used. This is important in understanding the potential pathophysiological changes in SPL-TN patients who differ from MS-TN patients.

We find that in our cohort, all but one patient with SPL-TN are nonresponders to surgical treatment, the majority having undergone 3 or more surgical procedures. The high number of surgical procedures, lack of response, and recurrence of pain in this cohort are noteworthy. Typically, neurosurgical procedures for TN are highly effective, with approximately 70 to 80% of patients with classical TN, and 50 to 80% of patients with MS-TN, achieving long-lasting pain relief after treatment. In cases when patients do not respond or pain recurs, repeat or alternative surgical procedures may be performed. A number of studies have shown that repeat procedures are a feasible option with a good likelihood of success and minimal risk of complications. However, it is uncommon for patients to undergo 3 or more procedures. Thus, if we consider treatment response profile as a spectrum across subtypes of TN, our findings suggest that SPL-TN patients would fall on the extreme end of "nonresponse" and are a critical type of nonresponder. Early identification of these patients is important and points to the role of novel treatment strategies, such as neuromodulation, for their management.

### Central post-stroke pain: advances in clinical and preclinical research [^1138WJn6]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical treatment

CPSP poses several unanswered questions compared with other pain syndromes. Its pathophysiological mechanism remains unclear. Furthermore, there is no established gold-standard drug for CPSP treatment. Clinical research suggests pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions help manage CPSP. Currently, the primary clinical treatments for CPSP include analgesics, neuromodulation technology and other potential treatments. For more detailed information, please refer to online supplemental material 3, which presents treatments used in clinical studies.

In summary, CPSP is likely to occur when patients present with pain and somatosensory abnormalities, accompanied by anxiety, depression, sleep disturbance and other brain dysfunctions due to cerebrovascular impairment impacting medulla-to-cortex somatosensory pathways. Since the exact aetiology and pathogenesis of CPSP are unclear, the diagnosis mainly relies on clinical evaluation. Various scales can help doctors evaluate the severity of pain and treatment efficacy. Additionally, based on current research evidences, drugs such as gabapentin have shown curative effects, and neurostimulation therapies are viable options for resistant cases.

Clinical studies have limitations when exploring new treatments and uncovering potential causes of CPSP. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct preclinical studies using animal experiments. Due to the high incidence of CPSP and the lack of adequate clinical treatments, preclinical studies have become important. Preclinical studies on CPSP have seen a notable rise, offering valuable insights into this condition's mechanisms and impact.

### Oxymatrine alleviates central post-stroke pain in rats by reducing the inflammatory response [^1177cfCD]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Stroke is one of the leading causes of disability globally and the second most common cause of death. Post-stroke pain (PSP) is a frequent symptom, affecting up to 55% of stroke survivors. Common types of PSP include central PSP (CPSP), complex regional pain syndrome, painful spasticity, and hemiplegic shoulder pain. Often, multiple pain types coexist. CPSP is estimated to occur in 1–12% of patients with stroke, but up to 63% of these individuals may experience it in combination with other forms of PSP.CPSP results from cerebrovascular disease impacting the central somatosensory system, with pain localized to the area of cerebrovascular injury. It is considered a severe, chronic central neuropathic pain disorder.CPSP significantly impairs quality of life during post-stroke recovery and is also linked to psychological issues, such as anxiety, depression, and sleep disturbances. Presently, CPSP shows limited response to first-line clinical treatments, and physical therapy remains underutilized. Thus, exploring potential therapeutic options for CPSP is critical.

Phantom-limb pain (PLP) belongs among difficult-to-treat chronic pain syndromes. Treatment options for PLP are to a large degree implicated by the level of understanding the mechanisms and nature of PLP. Research and clinical findings acknowledge the neuropathic nature of PLP and also suggest that both peripheral as well as central mechanisms, including neuroplastic changes in central nervous system, can contribute to PLP. Neuroimaging studies in PLP have indicated a relation between PLP and the neuroplastic changes. Further, it has been shown that the pathological neuroplastic changes could be reverted, and there is a parallel between an improvement (reversal) of the neuroplastic changes in PLP and pain relief. These findings facilitated explorations of novel neuromodulatory treatment strategies, adding to the variety of treatment approaches in PLP. Overall, available treatment options in PLP include pharmacological treatment, supportive non-pharmacological non-invasive strategies (eg, neuromodulation using transcranial magnetic stimulation, visual feedback therapy, or motor imagery; peripheral transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, physical therapy, reflexology, or various psychotherapeutic approaches), and invasive treatment strategies (eg, surgical destructive procedures, nerve blocks, or invasive neuromodulation using deep brain stimulation, motor cortex stimulation, or spinal cord stimulation). Venues of further development in PLP management include a technological and methodological improvement of existing treatment methods, an implementation of new techniques and products, and a development of new treatment approaches.

Nuclear neuroimaging in FBSS patients

Nuclear neuroimaging is considered a developing field within imaging FBSS patients and comprises a variety of functional imaging techniques. To the authors' knowledge, their use as a diagnostic tool in FBSS has never been investigated. However, SPECT of the human brain has been used to assess blood flow as a marker of neural activity. In one study, technetium-99m hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime coupled to white blood cells was injected in 18 FBSS patients to assess blood flow before and after SCS implantation. It was observed that patients who responded poorly to SCS elicited increased thalamic blood flow at baseline imaging. They also found that thalamic blood flow remained elevated after SCS treatment. Another nuclear neuroimaging tool in the radiologist's armamentarium concerns positron emission tomography (PET). PET can be carried out with different radioligands, which allows for imaging different biological processes. For example, the use of PET radiotracers which selectively label the upregulation of a peripheral benzodiazepine receptor in microglia, which occurs in neuropathic pain patients, has been proposed as a technique to visualize the state of the central nervous system and predict outcome following SCS treatment. Another option concerns using the widely available fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) for PET neuroimaging. When using FDG-PET imaging, it has been described that in patients with SCS, burst stimulation of the SCS device consistently modulated the medial pain pathway. Although both SPECT and PET neuroimaging show promising results with regard to screening of FBSS patients under consideration for SCS, other studies reaffirming or contradicting these results have not followed.

### Neurocircuitry basis of motor cortex-related analgesia as an emerging approach for chronic pain management [^112tHFiS]. Nature: Mental Health (2024). High credibility.

Aside from movement initiation and control, the primary motor cortex (M1) has been implicated in pain modulation mechanisms. A large body of clinical data has demonstrated that stimulation and behavioral activation of M1 result in clinically important pain relief in patients with specific chronic pain syndromes. However, despite its clinical importance, the full range of circuits for motor cortex-related analgesia (MCRA) remains an enigma. This review draws on insights from experimental and clinical data and provides an overview of the neurobiological mechanisms of MCRA, with particular emphasis on its neurocircuitry basis. Based on structural and functional connections of the M1 within the pain connectome, neural circuits for MCRA are discussed at different levels of the neuroaxis, specifically, the endogenous pain modulation system, the thalamus, the extrapyramidal system, non-noxious somatosensory systems, and cortico-limbic pain signatures. We believe that novel insights from this review will expedite our understanding of M1-induced pain modulation and offer hope for successful mechanism-based refinements of this interventional approach in chronic pain management.

### Congress of neurological surgeons systematic review and evidence-based guideline on neuroablative procedures for patients with cancer pain [^114VA3dP]. Neurosurgery (2021). High credibility.

Thalamotomy — cancer-related chronic neuropathic pain evidence and outcomes include two Class III reports. One radiosurgical series of Centromedian (CM-pf) thalamotomy reported that out of 52 patients with cancer pain, only 8 achieved excellent pain relief, 20 patients achieved satisfactory pain relief, and 24 were without substantial pain relief; patients with pain in the face and upper body were more likely to experience pain relief. Two patients (out of 52, or 3.8%) treated with radiosurgery developed hemiparesis following treatment, and the study did not include the time to pain relief using radiosurgery. A second study compared radiofrequency basal (sensory) thalamotomy to centromedian thalamotomy, noting that 96 and 87.5% of patients experienced pain relief respectively, and that centromedian thalamotomy was slightly more successful than sensory.

### Deep brain stimulation of the brainstem [^115qS2Kf]. Brain (2021). Medium credibility.

Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus, pallidum, and thalamus is an established therapy for various movement disorders. Limbic targets have also been increasingly explored for their application to neuropsychiatric and cognitive disorders. The brainstem constitutes another DBS substrate, although the existing literature on the indications for and the effects of brainstem stimulation remains comparatively sparse. The objective of this review was to provide a comprehensive overview of the pertinent anatomy, indications, and reported stimulation-induced acute and long-term effects of existing white and grey matter brainstem DBS targets. We systematically searched the published literature, reviewing clinical trial articles pertaining to DBS brainstem targets. Overall, 164 studies describing brainstem DBS were identified. These studies encompassed 10 discrete structures: periaqueductal/periventricular grey (n = 63), pedunculopontine nucleus (n = 48), ventral tegmental area (n = 22), substantia nigra (n = 9), mesencephalic reticular formation (n = 7), medial forebrain bundle (n = 8), superior cerebellar peduncles (n = 3), red nucleus (n = 3), parabrachial complex (n = 2), and locus coeruleus (n = 1). Indications for brainstem DBS varied widely and included central neuropathic pain, axial symptoms of movement disorders, headache, depression, and vegetative state. The most promising results for brainstem DBS have come from targeting the pedunculopontine nucleus for relief of axial motor deficits, periaqueductal/periventricular grey for the management of central neuropathic pain, and ventral tegmental area for treatment of cluster headaches. Brainstem DBS has also acutely elicited numerous motor, limbic, and autonomic effects. Further work involving larger, controlled trials is necessary to better establish the therapeutic potential of DBS in this complex area.

### Thalamic field potentials in chronic central pain treated by periventricular gray stimulation – a series of eight cases [^1156atdN]. Pain (2003). Low credibility.

Chronic deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the periventricular gray (PVG) has been used for the treatment of chronic central pain for decades. In recent years motor cortex stimulation (MCS) has largely supplanted DBS in the surgical management of intractable neuropathic pain of central origin. However, MCS provides satisfactory pain relief in about 50–75% of cases, a range comparable to that reported for DBS (none of the reports are in placebo-controlled studies and hence the further need for caution in evaluating and comparing these results). Our experience also suggests that there is still a role for DBS in the control of central pain. Here we present a series of eight consecutive cases of intractable chronic pain of central origin treated with PVG DBS with an average follow-up of 9 months. In each case, two electrodes were implanted in the PVG and the ventroposterolateral thalamic nucleus, respectively, under guidance of corneal topography/magnetic resonance imaging image fusion. The PVG was stimulated in the frequency range of 2–100 Hz in alert patients while pain was assessed using the McGill-Melzack visual analogue scale. In addition, local field potentials (FPs) were recorded from the sensory thalamus during PVG stimulation. Maximum pain relief was obtained with 5–35 Hz stimulation while 50–100 Hz made the pain worse. This suggests that pain suppression was frequency dependent. Interestingly, we detected low frequency thalamic FPs at 0.2–0.4 Hz closely associated with the pain. During 5–35 Hz PVG stimulation the amplitude of this potential was significantly reduced and this was associated with marked pain relief. At the higher frequencies (50–100 Hz), however, there was no reduction in the FPs and no pain suppression. We have found an interesting and consistent correlation between thalamic electrical activity and chronic pain. This low frequency potential may provide an objective index for quantifying chronic pain, and may hold further clues to the mechanism of action of PVG stimulation. It may be possible to use the presence of these slow FPs and the effect of trial PVG DBS on both the clinical status and the FPs to predict the probable success of future pain control in individual patients.

### Deep brain stimulation of the centre median-parafascicular complex in patients with movement disorders [^11394M34]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2002). Low credibility.

The centre median-parafascicular (CM-Pf) complex of the thalamus is considered to be a possible target for deep brain stimulation (DBS) in patients with movement disorders. In a prospective study on the effect of CM-Pf DBS versus somatosensory thalamic DBS on chronic neuropathic pain, three of 12 patients had additional movement disorders. Bifocal quadripolar electrodes were implanted by computed tomography guided stereotactic surgery under local anaesthesia contralaterally to the side of the pain for test stimulation. Two of the three patients with movement disorders had permanent implantation of CM-Pf electrodes. During test stimulation of the left CM-Pf complex for several days, a 67 year old woman received no benefit with respect to the neuropathic pain, but the choreoathetotic movements of her right foot ceased. As the pain syndrome was not improved, she decided not to have permanent implantation. A 74 year old man with postzoster neuralgia and allodynia enjoyed excellent relief from his pain with chronic CM-Pf DBS. In addition, improvement in the tremor at rest was noted. A 72 year old man had sustained reduction in his stump dyskinesias. Further evaluation of the possible role of the "forgotten" central and medial thalamic nuclei in the treatment of movement disorders may be warranted.

### Comprehensive evidence-based guidelines for implantable peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS) in the management of chronic pain: from the American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) [^112uthXs]. Pain Physician (2024). High credibility.

Peripheral nerve stimulation mechanisms — central pathway: Peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS) activates A-delta fibers in the periphery to stimulate inhibitory interneurons in the dorsal horn, suppressing nociceptive signals from A-delta and C fibers, and literature suggests that PNS may modulate higher central nervous system centers including the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, somatosensory cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, and parahippocampal areas. At the spinal level, effects on GABAergic and glycinergic transmission with increases in serotonin and dopamine metabolites and changes in substance P and calcitonin gene-related protein are described; PNS enhances inhibition of dorsal wide-dynamic range neurons, reduces a delta fiber activation in the medial lemniscus pathway, and affects the spinothalamic tract. The trigeminocervical complex extending from C2-C3 to the trigeminal nucleus caudalis receives convergent input and is modulated by descending inhibitory projections from the periaqueductal gray, nucleus raphe magnus, and rostral ventromedial medulla, whose stimulation produces significant antinociception, and thalamic activation with PNS can occur without altering underlying brainstem activation.

### Brain stimulation for chronic pain management: a narrative review of analgesic mechanisms and clinical evidence [^116yTm59]. Neurosurgical Review (2023). Medium credibility.

Thalamus is responsible for relaying and processing pain signals before transmitting them to the cerebral cortex. Some studies suggest that HF-rTMS may influence the activity of the cortical thalamic tract and inhibit the spinothalamic pathway in the ascending pathway and thalamic nuclei. The spinothalamic tract can be divided into two parts: the anterior spinothalamic tract, which is responsible for crude touch and pressure sensation, and the lateral spinothalamic tract, which carries sensations of pain and temperature. By inhibiting the ascending tract, HF-rTMS can reduce the transmission of nociceptive signals to the cerebral cortex and thalamus, thereby reducing the sensation of pain.

So far, all the research is only involved a limited number of people, which restricted the accountability of using rTMS to treat patients with chronic pain. However, it is still worth examining previous research (Table 4). Several studies have targeted MCS, which has shown greater pain reduction with longer session durations and more frequent stimulation using HF-rTMS. In the results of four studies, the levels of pain reduction are shown to be at least 40% of relief (a clinically significant reduction in pain intensity is approximately 30%), which implies the potential clinical value of the treatment in neuropathic pain. Although it appears to be clinically relevant, the small number of volunteers and a small number of sessions (5–10) and a short period of follow-up (< 3 weeks) make it unreliable to put the technique into clinical practice. Thus, more patients need to be involved in the research, and longer sessions and durations of follow-up are required.

### Central post-stroke pain: clinical characteristics, pathophysiology, and management [^1174TuEt]. The Lancet: Neurology (2009). Medium credibility.

Central post-stroke pain (CPSP) is a neuropathic pain syndrome that can occur after a cerebrovascular accident. This syndrome is characterised by pain and sensory abnormalities in the body parts that correspond to the brain territory that has been injured by the cerebrovascular lesion. The presence of sensory loss and signs of hypersensitivity in the painful area in patients with CPSP might indicate the dual combination of deafferentation and the subsequent development of neuronal hyperexcitability. The exact prevalence of CPSP is not known, partly owing to the difficulty in distinguishing this syndrome from other pain types that can occur after stroke (such as shoulder pain, painful spasticity, persistent headache, and other musculoskeletal pain conditions). Future prospective studies with clear diagnostic criteria are essential for the proper collection and processing of epidemiological data. Although treatment of CPSP is difficult, the most effective approaches are those that target the increased neuronal hyperexcitability.

### Functional radiosurgery in the management of cancer pain: a comprehensive review [^1115Rjgp]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

Functional radiosurgery is a minimally invasive and highly precise approach to managing refractory cancer pain, offering targeted interventions for both nociceptive and neuropathic pain mechanisms. By focusing on key neuroanatomical targets, such as the thalamus, cingulate cortex, pituitary gland, celiac plexus, and dorsal root ganglia, functional radiosurgery provides effective relief for complex pain syndromes that are often unresponsive to conventional therapies. Advances in imaging and treatment delivery have enhanced the safety and efficacy of these techniques, allowing clinicians to tailor interventions to individual patients.

### Deep brain stimulation for the treatment of various chronic pain syndromes [^116aE1vJ]. Neurosurgical Focus (2006). Low credibility.

Object

Electrical intracerebral stimulation (also referred to as deep brain stimulation [DBS]) is a tool for the treatment of chronic pain states that do not respond to less invasive or conservative treatment options. Careful patient selection, accurate target localization, and identification with intraoperative neurophysiological techniques and blinded test evaluation are the key requirements for success and good long-term results. The authors present their experience with DBS for the treatment of various chronic pain syndromes.

Methods

In this study 56 patients with different forms of neuropathic and mixed nociceptive/neuropathic pain syndromes were treated with DBS according to a rigorous protocol. The postoperative follow-up duration ranged from 1 to 8 years, with a mean of 3.5 years. Electrodes were implanted in the somatosensory thalamus and the periventricular gray region. Before implantation of the stimulation device, a double-blinded evaluation was carefully performed to test the effect of each electrode on its own as well as combined stimulation with different parameter settings. The best long-term results were attained in patients with chronic low-back and leg pain, for example, in so-called failed-back surgery syndrome. Patients with neuropathic pain of peripheral origin (such as complex regional pain syndrome Type II) also responded well to DBS. Disappointing results were documented in patients with central pain syndromes, such as pain due to spinal cord injury and poststroke pain. Possible reasons for the therapeutic failures are discussed; these include central reorganization and neuroplastic changes of the pain-transmitting pathways and pain modulation centers after brain and spinal cord lesions.

Conclusions

The authors found that, in carefully selected patients with chronic pain syndromes, DBS can be helpful and can add to the quality of life.

Central poststroke pain — definition and diagnostic features are that it results from a lesion in the somatosensory system rather than from a peripheral nociceptive or psychogenic cause, diagnostic criteria include that pain occur after stroke, be in a body area corresponding to the central nervous system lesion, and not be accounted for by nociceptive or peripheral neuropathic pain, it is classically associated with thalamic stroke (Dejerine-Roussy syndrome) but can result from lesions anywhere along the spinothalamic and thalamocortical tracts within the central nervous system, and symptoms are usually described as burning or aching.

Deep Brain Stimulation

Although deep brain stimulation (DBS) was first used in the 1950s for improvement of chronic pain, the technique fell out of favor in the late 1990s when two major multicenter trials failed to demonstrate efficacy. Nonetheless, a substantial body of literature cites the stimulation of periventricular grey (PVG), periaqueductal grey (PAG), and sensory thalamus as potential targeted regions for pain. The mechanism of action is still unclear, but release of endogenous opiates may play a role in pain relief. Nandi et al reported one patient with refractory TN treated with DBS of the PVG and ventroposterolateral thalamic nucleus. Though the patient ultimately did not undergo IPG implantation, during the trial stimulation she received 33% reduction in pain. Additional targets have also been tested for TN, such as the posterior hypothalamus. Franzini et al treated five patients with TN secondary to multiple sclerosis and reported that all five patients experienced pain reduction at 1–3 years postoperatively, although only two of the five patients did not require medications. Given its invasive nature and the need for permanent IPG implantation, DBS remains a salvage procedure for refractory TN.

Focused Ultrasound

Transcranial MR-guided focused ultrasound surgery is an evolving treatment modality in neurosurgery and has been used in clinical trials to treat chronic pain via thalamotomy and in the treatment of brain tumors. The ExAblate Neuro (InSightec) has 1024 ultrasound transducers, which transmit ultrasound energy through the skull that converges onto a focal spot and causes a highly focused region of heating, thereby creating a lesion in the target tissue. Martin et al utilized the Insightec system to treat nine patients with neuropathic pain, of which one had idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia. The patient underwent a central lateral thalamotomy. Pain relief 2 days after the intervention ranged from 30% to 100% for the 9 patients, but individual data are not available. No long-term outcomes are available from the study. More recently, Monteith et al demonstrated in a cadaveric model that the InSightec system is able to heat up the trigeminal nerve by up to 18°C. Future studies are needed to see if focused ultrasound may be effective in lesioning the trigeminal nerve in patients.

### European Academy of Neurology guideline on trigeminal neuralgia [^113JHHEi]. European Journal of Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose

Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) is an extremely painful condition which can be difficult to diagnose and treat. In Europe, TN patients are managed by many different specialities. Therefore, there is a great need for comprehensive European guidelines for the management of TN. The European Academy of Neurology asked an expert panel to develop recommendations for a series of questions that are essential for daily clinical management of patients with TN.

Methods

A systematic review of the literature was performed and recommendations was developed based on GRADE, where feasible; if not, a good practice statement was given.

Results

The use of the most recent classification system is recommended, which diagnoses TN as primary TN, either classical or idiopathic depending on the degree of neurovascular contact, or as secondary TN caused by pathology other than neurovascular contact. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), using a combination of three high-resolution sequences, should be performed as part of the work-up in TN patients, because no clinical characteristics can exclude secondary TN. If MRI is not possible, trigeminal reflexes can be used. Neurovascular contact plays an important role in primary TN, but demonstration of a neurovascular contact should not be used to confirm the diagnosis of TN. Rather, it may help to decide if and when a patient should be referred for microvascular decompression. In acute exacerbations of pain, intravenous infusion of fosphenytoin or lidocaine can be used. For long-term treatment, carbamazepine or oxcarbazepine are recommended as drugs of first choice. Lamotrigine, gabapentin, botulinum toxin type A, pregabalin, baclofen and phenytoin may be used either alone or as add-on therapy. It is recommended that patients should be offered surgery if pain is not sufficiently controlled medically or if medical treatment is poorly tolerated. Microvascular decompression is recommended as first-line surgery in patients with classical TN. No recommendation can be given for choice between any neuroablative treatments or between them and microvascular decompression in patients with idiopathic TN. Neuroablative treatments should be the preferred choice if MRI does not demonstrate any neurovascular contact. Treatment for patients with secondary TN should in general follow the same principles as for primary TN. In addition to medical and surgical management, it is recommended that patients are offered psychological and nursing support.

Conclusions

Compared with previous TN guidelines, there are important changes regarding diagnosis and imaging. These allow better characterization of patients and help in decision making regarding the planning of medical and surgical management. Recommendations on pharmacological and surgical management have been updated. There is a great need for future research on all aspects of TN, including pathophysiology and management.

Neuropathic ocular pain (NOP) — treatment options by pain generator — notes that treatment options depend on the location of nerve dysfunction; for peripheral NOP, topical nerve regenerative therapies like autologous serum tears can be used; for a central component or systemic comorbidities, oral neuromodulators (pregabalin, gabapentin, duloxetine, amitriptyline, nortriptyline, low-dose naltrexone) alone or in combination have been used with varying success; with light sensitivity and headache, adjuvant strategies used for migraine, such as a transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation device and periorbital botulinum toxin A injections, can be considered; for cutaneous allodynia or postsurgical pain, periocular nerve blocks with a corticosteroid plus a long-acting sodium channel blocker can be used; combinations are often used, and all neuromodulators require time to take effect, with about 3 to 4 months at a therapeutic dose to see pain reduction, so setting expectations and encouraging continuation even without immediate relief is crucial.

### Amitriptyline in the prophylaxis of central poststroke pain. preliminary results of 39 patients in a placebo-controlled, long-term study [^111qh6R9]. Stroke (2002). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

We performed a double-blind, placebo-controlled study to investigate the effectiveness of amitriptyline for the prophylactic treatment of patients with acute thalamic stroke in preventing central poststroke pain.

Methods

Subject received, in a randomized sequence, either amitriptyline titrated from 10 to 75 mg in extended-release form or placebo over a therapy period of 365 days. We documented the time when pain developed; the intensity, type, site, and distribution of pain; and the presence/absence and type of allodynia.

Results

Thirty-nine patients (23 women and 16 men; age range, 36 to 68 years) with central poststroke pain participated. The placebo group showed a pain rate of 21% within 1 year after the diagnosis of thalamic stroke compared with 17% in the group under prophylactic treatment with amitriptyline. Average (SE) time to pain was 318 (23) days for patients in the placebo group and 324 (24) days for patients in the amitriptyline group.

Conclusions

With the achieved sample sizes of this study and a pain rate of approximately 21% in the placebo group, any near-perfect pain protection would have been detected. Near-perfect pain protection, in this context, refers to pain in < 2.4% of the recruited patients treated with amitriptyline or in approximately 89% of placebo-treated patients. Larger studies are recommended to test the hypothesis that prophylactic amitriptyline reduces but does not completely prevent central poststroke pain.

### Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation for the treatment of complex regional pain syndrome: a pilot study [^112Ts67M]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is a chronic pain condition that is debilitating and dramatically decreases quality of life. CRPS is characterized by a constellation of sensory, motor, and autonomic dysfunction.CRPS differs from other chronic pain conditions; neuropathic or generalized non-specific pain conditions; in that pain is associated with obvious and distinct alterations in sensory processing, sympathetic nervous involvement, and motor dysfunction. CRPS patients commonly present with allodynia whereby non-painful stimuli evoke a painful sensation. The worldwide incidence of CRPS is 26.2 per 100,000 people per yearand is 3 to 4 times more prevalent in females. Options for medical management of CRPS include medications such as opioids, anticonvulsants, antidepressants, and procedures such as sympathetic blockade and invasive spinal cord stimulation. However, evidence for these treatments come from medium to low quality randomized controlled trials (RCT). At present, CRPS is managed through continued physiotherapy with supportive treatment for pain and mental health.

FIGURE 1
Nociceptive fibers. Small, fast‐conducting Aδ fibers (blue) respond to an initial stimulus and terminate in lamina II of the dorsal horn. Aδ fibers synapse directly with second‐order neurons which make up the ascending tracts. Small, unmyelinated slow‐conducting C fibers (red) terminate in lamina I and V of the dorsal horn. C fibers often synapse indirectly with second‐order neurons via interneurons [Correction added on 16 December 2024, after first online publication: The figure caption has been updated.]

FIGURE 2
Spinothalamic and spinoreticular tracts. Nociceptive fibers transmit their signal by synapsing with a neuron in the dorsal horn, crossing over to the opposite side of the spinal cord at that level, and then ascending to the integrative centers in the thalamus. The two most important tracts are the spinothalamic and spinoreticular tracts. (A) The lateral spinothalamic (orange) tract ascends directly to the ventral posterior lateral nucleus of the thalamus. The medial spinothalamic tract (red) sends collaterals to the periaqueductal gray matter, hypothalamus, and reticular system in the midbrain before reaching the medial thalamus.(B) The spinoreticular tract (blue) arises from the dorsal horn and sends collaterals to the reticular formations in the medulla and pons. It continues to the thalamus ventral posterior lateral and medial nuclei, where third‐order neurons project to higher cortical and midbrain centers with important projections to the limbic system associated with memory, emotion, and behavior [Correction added on 16 December 2024, after first online publication: The figure caption has been updated.]

Nociceptorsare excitatory neurons and release glutamate as their primary neurotransmitter as well as other components including peptides such as substance P, and calcitonin gene‐related peptide, which are all important in central synaptic signaling and efferent signaling in the skin. Nociceptors express a wide variety of voltage‐gated channels that transduce the receptor potential into an action potential or a set of action potentials that encode the intensity of noxious stimulus applied within their receptive fields. When there is damage to the primary sensory neurons, these neurons and their immediate non‐injured neighbors start to fire action potentials spontaneously called ectopic discharges, leading to increased expression and altered trafficking of sodium channels. Since enhanced excitability of primary sensory neurons in inflammatory and pathologic pain states is a major contributor to the perception of pain, specific pharmacological agents that specifically dampen aberrant activity are desirable in the design of pain therapeutics.

### Effectiveness of tonic and burst motor cortex stimulation in chronic neuropathic pain [^116Mtrrz]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

MCS is supposed to be last resort of treatment for chronic, neuropathic pain of central and peripheral origin; pain that is refractory to pharmacological treatment and that cannot be treated with other stimulation techniques such as SCS and peripheral nerve stimulation. Frequently after long-term MCS the analgesic effects of neuromodulation are diminished due to habituation on stimulation. In our series we examined patients with central neurogenic, ie thalamic syndrome after stroke or traumatic brain injury, and neuropathic facial pain. Out of 14 patients who received MCS, 6 were subjected to burst stimulation of the cerebral cortex. Patients with refractory pain lasting for a long period approximately 16 years (mean value) treated with tonic MCS for approximately 6 years (mean value) posed a challenge for achieving a satisfactory pain reduction. Primary waveform of MCS was tonic stimulation with frequency of 10–50 Hz with amplitudes from 1–10 mA. Although tonic MCS in the majority of patients with all types of central pain after long-term of stimulation had provided moderate effects, patients demanded reimplantation of IPG, when the battery had been depleted. After the implantation of the new IPG, patients were able to choose between tonic and burst stimulations. The most preferred option was burst stimulation. Due to exacerbation of pain in the period before replacement, patients were receiving analgesics such as tramadol. After surgery they were asked to reduce doses or withdraw it. The majority of them were taking 1 or 2 tramadol daily but no one noticed significant improvement after it. Gabapentin was the medicine administered permanently in unchanged doses to patient 2 before and during both tonic and burst stimulation.

### Practice parameter: the diagnostic evaluation and treatment of trigeminal neuralgia (an evidence-based review): report of the quality standards subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology and the European Federation of Neurological Societies [^1164Ei19]. Neurology (2008). Medium credibility.

Practice parameter — diagnostic evaluation and treatment of trigeminal neuralgia: In patients with trigeminal neuralgia (TN), routine head imaging identifies structural causes in up to 15% of patients and may be considered useful (Level C). Trigeminal sensory deficits, bilateral involvement of the trigeminal nerve, and abnormal trigeminal reflexes are associated with an increased risk of symptomatic TN (STN) and should be considered useful in distinguishing STN from classic trigeminal neuralgia (Level B). There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the usefulness of MRI to identify neurovascular compression of the trigeminal nerve (Level U). Carbamazepine (Level A) or oxcarbazepine (Level B) should be offered for pain control while baclofen and lamotrigine (Level C) may be considered useful. For patients with TN refractory to medical therapy, Gasserian ganglion percutaneous techniques, gamma knife, or microvascular decompression may be considered (Level C). The role of surgery vs pharmacotherapy in the management of patients with TN remains uncertain.

### Systematic review of central post stroke pain: what is happening in the central nervous system? [^117Vbo5i]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2016). Low credibility.

Central poststroke pain (CPSP) is one of the most common central neuropathic pain syndromes seen after stroke. It is mainly related with vascular damage at certain brain territory and pain related to corresponding body areas. In the past, it was described as one of the definitive symptoms of thalamic lesion. However, recent findings suggest that it is not only seen after thalamic lesions but also seen after vascular lesions in any part of the central nervous system. Although there are certain hypotheses to explain physiopathologic mechanisms of CPSP, further evidence is needed. The majority of the cases are intractable and unresponsive to analgesic treatment. Electrical stimulation such as deep brain stimulation and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation seems to be effective in certain cases. In this systematic review, recent advancements related to CPSP mechanisms have been evaluated. Further investigations are needed in order to reveal the mystery of the pathophysiologic mechanisms of CPSP.

### Deep brain stimulation for intractable neuropathic facial pain [^1153dERj]. Neurosurgical Focus (2018). Low credibility.

OBJECTIVE Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a well-established, evidence-based therapy with FDA approval for Parkinson's disease and essential tremor. Despite the early successful use of DBS to target the sensory thalamus for intractable facial pain, subsequent studies pursuing various chronic pain syndromes reported variable efficacy, keeping DBS for pain as an investigational and "off-label" use. The authors report promising results for a contemporary series of patients with intractable facial pain who were treated with DBS. METHODS Pain outcomes for 7 consecutive patients with unilateral, intractable facial pain undergoing DBS of the ventral posteromedial nucleus of the thalamus (VPM) and the periaqueductal gray (PAG) were retrospectively reviewed. Pain was assessed preoperatively and at multiple postoperative time points using the visual analog scale (VAS), the Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire-2 (SF-MPQ-2), and the Pain Disability Index (PDI). RESULTS VAS scores significantly decreased from a mean ± SD of 9.0 ± 1.3 preoperatively to 2.6 ± 1.5 at 1 year postoperatively (p = 0.001). PDI scores decreased from a mean total of 48.5 to 28.5 (p = 0.01). SF-MPQ-2 scores decreased from a mean of 4.6 to 2.4 (p = 0.03). Notably, several patients did not experience maximum improvement until 6–9 months postoperatively, correlating with repeated programming adjustments. CONCLUSIONS DBS of the VPM and PAG is a potential therapeutic option for patients suffering from severe, intractable facial pain refractory to other interventions. Improved efficacy may be observed over time with close follow-up and active DBS programming adjustments.

### Complex regional pain syndrome: practical diagnostic and treatment guidelines, 4th edition [^114K7xdp]. Pain Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

This is the fourth edition of diagnostic and treatment guidelines for complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS; aka reflex sympathetic dystrophy).

Methods

Expert practitioners in each discipline traditionally utilized in the treatment of CRPS systematically reviewed the available and relevant literature; due to the paucity of levels 1 and 2 studies, less rigorous, preliminary research reports were included. The literature review was supplemented with knowledge gained from extensive empirical clinical experience, particularly in areas where high-quality evidence to guide therapy is lacking.

Results

The research quality, clinical relevance, and "state of the art" of diagnostic criteria or treatment modalities are discussed, sometimes in considerable detail with an eye to the expert practitioner in each therapeutic area. Levels of evidence are mentioned when available, so that the practitioner can better assess and analyze the modality under discussion, and if desired, to personally consider the citations. Tables provide details on characteristics of studies in different subject domains described in the literature.

Conclusions

In the humanitarian spirit of making the most of all current thinking in the area, balanced by a careful case-by-case analysis of the risk/cost vs benefit analysis, the authors offer these "practical" guidelines.

### Different types of pain in complex regional pain syndrome require a personalized treatment strategy [^111Kqk8F]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS) is a syndrome that is initiated by trauma to an extremity. This results in continuous regional pain that is disproportionate to the extent and healing of the trauma. Besides continuous pain, patients have additional clinical signs such as disturbed blood flow or abnormal sudomotor activity, motor dysfunction, and trophic changes in the affected CRPS extremity. CRPS is a clinical diagnosis based on the new International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) diagnostic criteria for CRPS, that were validated in 2010 and adopted by the IASP in 2012. Nowadays, CRPS is considered a multi-mechanism syndrome, and the experienced continuous pain can be linked to mechanisms such as inflammation, vasomotor disturbances, and peripheral and central sensitization. The presentation of symptoms and signs of CRPS patients can be heterogeneous, because a combination of the underlying mechanisms may be more prominent. Rather than a one-size-fits-all treatment approach, pain specialists nowadays specifically determine the most prominent underlying mechanism(s). These mechanisms are targeted with different pharmacologic treatment categories in order to improve treatment efficacy.

To personalize the management of CRPS, several subgroups have been suggested. The subgroups CRPS type 1 (without nerve lesion) and CRPS type 2 (with nerve lesion) are recognized by the IASP. In addition, different subgroups have been proposed based on clinical presentation (warm/cold), syndrome duration (early/persistent), and underlying pathophysiological mechanisms (peripheral/centraland florid/sensory/vasomotor). Recently, our research group suggested creating subgroups on the mechanisms that are targeted by the pharmacotherapeutic options for CRPS: 1) inflammation; 2) peripheral and central sensitization; 3) vasomotor disturbances and 4) motor disturbances. Unfortunately, there is no consensus yet on which classification of CRPS subtypes is best to use.

Different presentations of symptom pain in CRPS can potentially also identify possible subgroups of CRPS that require a distinct treatment strategy. The IASP recognizes nociceptive (tissue damage), neuropathic (nerve injury), and nociplastic pain (sensitized nervous system) as distinct pain types driven by different mechanisms. In this article, we describe a strategy to phenotype CRPS patients based on the three types of chronic pain defined by the IASP because this classification affects the work-up and treatment decisions in chronic pain. Diagnostic tests and biomarkers are developed for nociceptive and neuropathic pain. However, especially to differentiate nociplastic pain, diagnostic tests have to be further developed.

### Functional MRI-guided motor cortex and deep brain stimulation for intractable facial pain: a novel, personalized approach in 1 patient [^115fMtbP]. Operative Neurosurgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Facial neuropathic pain syndromes such as trigeminal neuralgia are debilitating disorders commonly managed by medications, vascular decompression, and/or ablative procedures. In trigeminal neuralgia cases unresponsive to these interventions, trigeminal deafferentation pain syndrome (TDPS) can emerge and remain refractory to any further attempts at these conventional therapies. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) and motor cortex stimulation are 2 neuromodulatory treatments that have demonstrated efficacy in small case series of TDPS yet remain largely underutilized. In addition, functional MRI (fMRI) is a tool that can help localize central processing of evoked stimuli such as mechanically triggered facial pain. In this study, we present a case report and operative technique in a patient with TDPS who underwent fMRI to guide the operative management and placement of dual targets in the sensory thalamus and motor cortex.

Objective

To evaluate the safety, efficacy, and outcome of a novel surgical approach for TDPS in a single patient.

Methods

The fMRI and operative technique of unilateral DBS targeting the ventroposteromedial nucleus of the thalamus and facial motor cortex stimulator placement through a single burr hole is illustrated as well as the patient's clinical outcome.

Results

In less than 1 year, the patient had near complete resolution of his facial pain with no postoperative complications.

Conclusion

We present the first published case of successful treatment of TDPS using simultaneous DBS of the ventroposteromedial and motor cortex stimulation. fMRI can be used as an effective imaging modality to guide neuromodulation in this complex disorder.

### Assessing the risk of central post-stroke pain of thalamic origin by lesion mapping [^112zwoic]. Brain (2012). Low credibility.

Central post-stroke pain of thalamic origin is an extremely distressing and often refractory disorder. There are no well-established predictors for pain development after thalamic stroke, and the role of different thalamic nuclei is unclear. Here, we used structural magnetic resonance imaging to identify the thalamic nuclei, specifically implicated in the generation of central post-stroke pain of thalamic origin. Lesions of 10 patients with central post-stroke pain of thalamic origin and 10 control patients with thalamic strokes without pain were identified as volumes of interest on magnetic resonance imaging data. Non-linear deformations were estimated to match each image with a high-resolution template and were applied to each volume of interest. By using a digital atlas of the thalamus, we elucidated the involvement of different nuclei with respect to each lesion. Patient and control volumes of interest were summed separately to identify unique areas of involvement. Voxelwise odds ratio maps were calculated to localize the anatomical site where lesions put patients at risk of developing central post-stroke pain of thalamic origin. In the patients with pain, mainly lateral and posterior thalamic nuclei were affected, whereas a more anterior-medial lesion pattern was evident in the controls. The lesions of 9 of 10 pain patients overlapped at the border of the ventral posterior nucleus and the pulvinar, coinciding with the ventrocaudalis portae nucleus. The lesions of this area showed an odds ratio of 81 in favour of developing thalamic pain. The high odds ratio at the ventral posterior nucleus-pulvinar border zone indicates that this area is crucial in the pathogenesis of thalamic pain and demonstrates the feasibility of identifying patients at risk of developing central post-stroke pain of thalamic origin early after thalamic insults. This provides a basis for pre-emptive treatment studies.

### Antidepressants in irritable bowel syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^111rHxmF]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Summary Box

What is already known:

The treatment of irritable bowel syndrome is complex, and many of the recommended therapies lack high-quality evidence
Several neuromodulators exert localized effects on both the central and peripheral nervous systems and may offer benefits to these patients

What the new findings are:

Atidepressants from various classes have demonstrated efficacy not only in refractory patients or those with underlying psychopathology but also in the majority of patients, regardless of subgroup classification
Beyond their role in alleviating overall symptoms, antidepressants serve as a valuable therapeutic option for the relief of abdominal pain and bloating — the latter being a symptom for which few treatments have been conclusively proven effective

Surgery timing in TN — patient surveys and evidence strength. There are no studies specifically addressing when to offer surgery; two Class IV surveys of patients who had already undergone surgery found that the majority would have preferred to have had surgery earlier, and the conclusion is that there is insufficient evidence to allow strong inferences on when surgery should be offered to patients with TN.

### Outcome after pituitary radiosurgery for thalamic pain syndrome [^117PZXsJ]. International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology, Physics (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose

To evaluate outcomes after pituitary radiosurgery in patients with post-stroke thalamic pain syndrome.

Methods and Materials

From 2002 to 2006, 24 patients with thalamic pain syndrome underwent pituitary radiosurgery at Tokyo Women's Medical University and were followed at least 12 months thereafter. The radiosurgical target was defined as the pituitary gland and its connection with the pituitary stalk. The maximum dose varied from 140 to 180 Gy. Mean follow-up after treatment was 35 months (range, 12–48 months).

Results

Initial pain reduction, usually within 48 h after radiosurgery, was marked in 17 patients (71%). However, in the majority of cases the pain recurred within 6 months after treatment, and at the time of the last follow-up examination durable pain control was marked in only 5 patients (21%). Ten patients (42%) had treatment-associated side effects. Anterior pituitary abnormalities were marked in 8 cases and required hormonal replacement therapy in 3; transient diabetes insipidus was observed in 2 cases, transient hyponatremia in 1, and clinical deterioration due to increase of the numbness severity despite significant reduction of pain was seen once.

Conclusions

Pituitary radiosurgery for thalamic pain results in a high rate of initial efficacy and is accompanied by acceptable morbidity. It can be used as a primary minimally invasive management option for patients with post-stroke thalamic pain resistant to medical therapy. However, in the majority of cases pain recurrence occurs within 1 year after treatment.

### Central post-stroke pain: advances in clinical and preclinical research [^113RvRkM]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

The pathogenesis of CPSP could be closely associated with the glial activation and neuronal hyperexcitability that occur in response to thalamic haemorrhage in rats. Specifically, spinal monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 is released, which results in the effects above. At present, the treatment of CPSP involves the use of drugs that decrease neuronal excitability, indirectly supporting the central axis sensitisation mechanism. However, relative blockers in these pathways should be developed to relieve symptoms in preclinical and clinical trials. Such drugs would be instrumental in targeting the underlying mechanisms of CPSP, thereby providing significant therapeutic benefits to patients.

Neuroinflammation

Neuroinflammation is considered a significant factor in developing chronic pain. Apoptosis and inflammation in the VPL also contribute to CPSP. Moreover, neuroinflammation can interact with endoplasmic reticulum stress, leading to central sensitisation. A review suggests that factors, for instance, inflammasome with the NLR pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3), an increased microglial inflammatory response, alteration of GABAergic pathways in thalamic reticular neurons and inhibition of ventral basal interneurons may contribute to CPSP. For detailed research on neuroinflammation, please see online supplemental material 6.

It is essential to recognise that neuroinflammation is a complex process that involves activating various immune cellsand the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines. The resulting inflammation reaction can profoundly impact the CNS, leading to hyperexcitability and hyperalgesia. Given the significant contribution of neuroinflammation to CPSP pathogenesis, it is imperative to develop effective strategies to mitigate this response. Enhancing researchers' comprehension of neuroinflammation's basic mechanisms and its impact on CPSP will undoubtedly lead to the development of novel therapeutic interventions and improve the stroke survivors' quality of life

### Pharmacologic management part 2: lesser-studied neuropathic pain diseases [^114yY7hj]. Pain Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

This second part of a review of the pharmacologic management of neuropathic pain diseases describes the current treatment options for three lesser-studied neuropathic syndromes: Central poststroke pain, spinal cord injury, and complex regional pain syndrome II. Diagnosis can be difficult in patients with these syndromes, because the pain experienced is much greater and of a different type than would normally be expected following a stroke or injury to the spinal cord or a peripheral nerve. Even when an accurate and timely diagnosis is made, treatment options are limited and frequently suboptimal. However, the results of published trials do support the use of anticonvulsants and/or tricyclic antidepressants as first-line pharmacotherapy in these three neuropathic pain syndromes. To maximize treatment outcomes, future research must: Continue to more fully elucidate the relationship between the signs and symptoms of pain and the underlying pathophysiology; Delineate the natural history of central poststroke pain, spinal cord injury, and complex regional pain syndrome; Identify patient-related factors that may indicate an increased risk of developing neuropathic pain following stroke or nerve injury; Investigate emerging treatments that target underlying pain mechanisms.

### Low-dose naltrexone's utility for non-cancer centralized pain conditions: a scoping review [^1144pmkR]. Pain Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Chronic pain affects an estimated 11% to 40% of the US populationand is associated with negative patient outcomes, including decreased function, reduced quality of life, and significant socioeconomic impacts. Although multiple factors have been implicated in the development of chronic pain, central sensitization has been identified as a primary pathophysiological process in most chronic pain syndromes. The mechanisms underlying the development of central sensitization are complex and multifactorial; they include changes in neuronal response properties and integration of nociceptive information in the CNS. Of particular relevance to the present study, abnormal pain processing mediated by alterations in microglial structure/function could play a role in perpetuating sensitization, separate from any direct physical damage or inflammation to neurons. Microglia are resident CNS macrophages and serve a primary defense role in the brain and spinal cord. Normally in a quiescent state, microglia become activated by typical immune triggers such as cell death, peripheral inflammation, and infection. Once activated, they undergo morphological changes and release a broad profile of cytokines and other proinflammatory mediators that are capable of altering response properties in individual neurons and within neuronal networks. Unfortunately, abnormal or repeated activation of microglia can lead to augmented activation and ultimately heightened responses to pain signals, leading to central sensitization.

Although the term "central sensitization" refers to specific changes in CNS neuronal response properties, central sensitization is characterized behaviorally by the presence of hyperalgesia and allodynia, defined as increased pain response to noxious and non-noxious stimuli, respectively. Centralized pain conditions are strictly a clinical diagnosis of exclusion. Patients usually have > 3 months of widespread or multifocal allodynia and hyperalgesia without physical exam, neurological, or laboratory findings that would account for the pain. Often, however, there will be other concurrent symptoms, such as memory loss, fatigue, depression, or anxiety. Centralized pain syndromes are grouped under the new International Association of the Study of Pain definition of "nociplastic pain", in which the experience of pain is present in the absence of clear evidence of actual or threatened tissue damage or evidence for disease of the somatosensory system. As such, with nociception occurring with no clear peripheral or central lesion or pathology, treatment of centralized pain is complex and challenging. Currently, limited treatment options exist for patients with chronic centralized pain. For many of the available options, including behavioral therapy, antidepressants, neuropathic medications, and exercise, the efficacy and longevity are limited.

### The neurosurgical treatment of pain… [^116jCMT5]. JAMA Network (2003). Excellent credibility.

More than 80% of patients will benefit from spinal cord stimulation by a decrease in anginal frequency and a decreased need for nitrates, 11 and there is evidence12 for improvement in cardiac efficiency. Spinal cord stimulation is also a mainstay in the treatment of complex regional pain syndromes I and II, 1, 4, 10 peripheral nerve injury, and peripheral neuropathy. There has also been success in the treatment of postherpetic neuralgia13 and spinal cord injury, 14 but only if sensation is intact. A consensus statement of indications has been published.
15. Stimulation of either the sensory thalamus or the periaqueductal gray is achieved with a stereotactically implanted electrode connected to a permanently implanted generator placed over the chest. Nociceptive pain seems to respond better than neuropathic pain, although results are variable. The highest success rates are for the failed back syndrome, and the lowest are for central pain.

Morbidity is relatively low, and deep brain stimulation is often tried before any ablative procedures.

1. This mixture of nociceptive and neuropathic pain responds well to spinal cord stimulation in 50% of patients. 1–3 The success rate of deep brain stimulation is also high, although this procedure is rarely used. Treatment with intraspinal drug delivery systems is controversial. Three types of neurosurgical procedures are useful for trigeminal neuralgia. First, in microvascular decompression, an artery is dissected and held away from the trigeminal nerve through a suboccipital exposure to reduce the pulse pressure believed to be related to the pain. Success rates are as high as 70% in 10 years. 20 Second, percutaneous procedures are performed by passing a needle under fluoroscopic guidance into the trigeminal ganglion through the foramen ovale. The existence of several procedures for trigeminal neuralgia suggests that none is ideal.

Microvascular decompression is often recommended for young and healthy patients, or for those who want to avoid sensory deficits, whereas percutaneous procedures are often chosen for elderly and frail patients. Radiosurgery is also well tolerated by elderly patients, although its use for those able to undergo microvascular decompression is controversial because of its lower rate of success. Many patients will choose radiosurgery rather than microvascular decompression because of its low morbidity, while some will choose otherwise to achieve immediate relief of pain.
