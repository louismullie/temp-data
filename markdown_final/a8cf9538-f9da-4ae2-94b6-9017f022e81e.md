## Question

What are the most effective medications for pediatric asthma patients?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the most effective medications for pediatric asthma, organized by age and stepwise severity, with attention to reliever strategies, adherence, and special populations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overarching guideline framework and the principle of stepwise, personalized care. Then, I should verify age-specific recommendations for children 5 years and younger versus 6–11 years. Next, I will examine reliever strategies, including ICS-formoterol and SABA-based approaches, and reconcile any apparent discrepancies. After that, I should review add-on therapies for severe asthma and the role of biologics. Finally, I will integrate adherence, device technique, and monitoring considerations, and close with a concise, clinically actionable summary that aligns with high-credibility sources.

> Let me first confirm the foundational principle: pediatric asthma management is stepwise and individualized, with ICS-containing therapy as the cornerstone across ages to achieve symptom control and minimize future risk; SABA-only treatment is not recommended for children 6 years and older due to increased risk, and treatment should be adjusted in a continual cycle of assess, adjust, and review, incorporating adherence and inhaler technique at every visit [^113pQ9XK] [^113CD9Bg] [^114UsfUs].

> I need to check the age-specific framework. For children 5 years and younger, GINA emphasizes that diagnosis is symptom-based and that low-dose ICS is the preferred controller; reliever therapy is individualized, and SABA-only approaches are sometimes used in this age group due to limited evidence and device constraints, though ICS-containing strategies are preferred when feasible [^113pQ9XK] [^113HSkDw]. For children 6–11 years, GINA provides detailed stepwise recommendations and explicitly recommends ICS-containing therapy rather than SABA-only treatment, with step selection driven by symptom frequency, nocturnal awakenings, and lung function where measurable [^116aZEEc] [^113miNTi].

> Now, let me consider Step 1 (intermittent symptoms). For children 6–11 years, preferred options include low-dose ICS taken whenever SABA is used (separate inhalers or combination), or as-needed low-dose ICS-formoterol where available; these strategies reduce severe exacerbations compared with SABA alone, and ERS guidance supports as-needed ICS-formoterol over SABA-only in mild asthma, with pediatric data evolving and device limitations noted in younger children [^116aZEEc] [^112QLoSx] [^111EWLkH]. Wait, I initially thought SABA-only might be acceptable here, but I should correct that: GINA advises against SABA-only for children 6 years and older, so any reliever strategy should include ICS when possible [^114UsfUs].

> Next, I should review Step 2 (mild persistent symptoms). For children 6–11 years, daily low-dose ICS plus as-needed SABA is preferred; alternatives include taking ICS whenever SABA is used or daily leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA), recognizing that LTRA is generally less effective for exacerbation prevention than ICS; reassessment for benefit within 4–6 weeks is advised, and if no clear benefit with good technique and adherence, consider alternative diagnoses or adjustments [^116aZEEc]. Hold on, I should verify growth considerations: while daily ICS can modestly suppress growth, the clinical impact is small and generally outweighed by asthma control benefits, with intermittent strategies showing less growth impact in some studies, though long-term lung outcomes remain uncertain [^111xgFUq].

> I will now examine Step 3 (moderate persistent symptoms). For children 6–11 years, preferred options include low-dose ICS-LABA plus as-needed SABA, medium-dose ICS plus as-needed SABA, or very low-dose ICS-formoterol maintenance-and-reliever therapy (MART) where available; LTRA can be added if ICS is not tolerated or adherence is a concern, but ICS-LABA combinations are typically more effective for exacerbation prevention than ICS alone in pediatric populations [^116aZEEc] [^1134tmVj]. Let me double-check the MART evidence: adult and adolescent data show robust exacerbation reduction with ICS-formoterol MART, and pediatric guidance increasingly incorporates MART with age-appropriate devices and supervision [^1118YidJ].

> For Step 4 (daily symptoms, frequent nocturnal awakenings, low lung function), I should confirm that medium-dose ICS-LABA plus as-needed SABA or low-dose ICS-formoterol MART are appropriate, with specialist referral considered if control remains suboptimal despite correct technique and adherence; GINA also notes that many real-world severe asthma patients would not meet trial inclusion criteria, underscoring the need for expert assessment and phenotype-directed care [^116aZEEc] [^113gNw6d].

> At Step 5 (severe, therapy-resistant asthma), I need to ensure referral for expert evaluation, confirmation of diagnosis, and phenotype assessment; add-on options include LAMA (tiotropium), LTRA, and biologics targeting IgE, IL-4/13, or IL-5 pathways, with low-dose maintenance oral corticosteroids reserved as a last resort due to adverse effects; FeNO-guided strategies can reduce exacerbations in selected pediatric and young adult patients, and biologic selection should align with phenotype and exacerbation profile [^113gNw6d] [^116eivKt] [^116GedJP] [^111gcWDw]. Hold on, I should verify pediatric labeling: availability and approvals vary by region, so clinicians must check local eligibility and payer criteria before prescribing biologics [^111chcsG].

> Let me reconsider reliever strategies across ages to avoid confusion. GINA recommends that all children 6 years and older receive ICS-containing treatment, either as daily ICS with as-needed SABA or as ICS-formoterol used as anti-inflammatory reliever or MART; SABA-only therapy is not recommended due to increased risk of exacerbations and mortality, whereas in children 5 years and younger, SABA-only may still be used pragmatically given limited evidence and device constraints, though ICS-containing approaches are preferred when feasible [^114UsfUs] [^111uCzH1]. I should confirm that SMART/MART is increasingly endorsed for adolescents and adults, with pediatric expansion cautiously evolving and dependent on device availability and supervision [^1118YidJ].

> I need to ensure adherence and technique are addressed explicitly because poor adherence drives a large proportion of uncontrolled pediatric asthma. Every visit should include assessment of inhaler technique and adherence using standardized tools, and digital adherence interventions show promise for improving both adherence and outcomes; smart inhalers, when available and affordable, can support objective monitoring and feedback [^114HpJmX] [^116n7fdz] [^11367m9R]. But wait, what if the family prefers non-digital approaches? Education, simplified regimens, and shared decision-making remain essential, and GINA highlights high-impact system strategies such as free ICS after hospitalization and structured self-management programs to improve real-world control [^114tT71Z].

> Next, I should review monitoring and step-down principles. GINA advises reviewing control every 3–12 months, sooner after treatment changes or exacerbations, and stepping down to the lowest effective dose after at least 3 months of good control; individualized risk–benefit discussions should consider prior OCS use, exacerbation frequency, and prior intensive care needs before de-escalation [^115AemWM] [^117By7Ry]. I should double-check that improvement with controller therapy may take days to weeks, with full benefit often evident by 3–4 months, which should temper premature step-ups or switches [^115AemWM].

> Finally, I will synthesize the most effective medications by age and severity while keeping the evidence hierarchy in mind. For children 6–11 years with persistent asthma, ICS-containing regimens are foundational; ICS-LABA combinations are among the most effective strategies for preventing exacerbations, and ICS-formoterol MART is a preferred approach where available and appropriate; for children 5 years and younger, low-dose ICS is the preferred controller, with reliever choices individualized and SABA-only reserved when ICS is not feasible; across all ages, LTRA is a reasonable alternative or add-on when ICS is not tolerated or adherence is problematic, though it is generally less effective for exacerbation prevention than ICS-based strategies [^116aZEEc] [^1134tmVj] [^113pQ9XK]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about any single "best" drug — effectiveness depends on correct diagnosis, phenotype, device technique, and sustained adherence, so the most effective medication is the one the child can actually use correctly and consistently within a stepwise, monitored care plan [^113CD9Bg].

---

Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are the **most effective medications** for pediatric asthma, providing the greatest reduction in symptoms and exacerbations with a favorable safety profile [^11489SRU] [^113miNTi]. For children with uncontrolled symptoms on ICS alone, **add-on therapy with a long-acting beta-agonist (LABA)** is recommended [^111DJ5mc] [^1134tmVj]. Leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRAs) are appropriate alternatives when ICS are not tolerated or adherence is a concern [^111DJ5mc] [^116aZEEc]. Biologics (omalizumab, mepolizumab, dupilumab) are reserved for severe, refractory asthma with specific phenotypes [^111DJ5mc] [^11246qvZ]. Short-acting beta-agonists (SABA) remain essential relievers, but **SABA-only therapy is discouraged** due to increased risk of exacerbations and mortality [^111uCzH1] [^114UsfUs]. Treatment should be individualized based on age, severity, and phenotype, with regular monitoring and stepwise adjustment [^113CD9Bg] [^115AemWM].

## Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS)

ICS are the cornerstone of pediatric asthma management, **reducing airway inflammation**, improving lung function, and decreasing exacerbations [^113pQ9XK] [^116GSdob]. They are recommended as first-line therapy for persistent asthma in children of all ages [^113pQ9XK] [^11144Rk9].

- **Efficacy**: ICS significantly reduce asthma symptoms, improve lung function, and decrease exacerbations [^11489SRU] [^111xgFUq].
- **Safety**: Long-term use of low-dose ICS is generally safe, with minimal impact on growth velocity [^11144Rk9] [^116KE8Bk].
- **Adherence**: Poor adherence to ICS is a major cause of uncontrolled asthma in children [^114MBJ84] [^1153RYyx].

---

## Long-acting beta-agonists (LABA)

LABAs, such as salmeterol and formoterol, are recommended as **add-on therapy** for children whose asthma remains uncontrolled despite ICS therapy [^113pQ9XK] [^1134tmVj]. They provide sustained bronchodilation and improve symptom control [^111zjRmt].

- **Efficacy**: Combination therapy with ICS and LABA significantly improves asthma control and reduces exacerbations compared to ICS alone [^1134tmVj].
- **Safety**: LABAs should always be used in combination with ICS to mitigate the risk of severe exacerbations [^notfound].
- **Age considerations**: LABA combination therapy is recommended for children aged 6 years and older [^111DJ5mc] [^116aZEEc].

---

## Leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRAs)

LTRAs, such as montelukast, are recommended as **alternative controller therapy** for children who cannot tolerate ICS or have adherence issues [^112qZZSr] [^116aZEEc]. They are particularly useful in children with allergic rhinitis or exercise-induced bronchospasm [^notfound].

- **Efficacy**: LTRAs reduce asthma symptoms and exacerbations, particularly in children with allergic phenotypes [^112KWYmQ].
- **Safety**: LTRAs are generally well-tolerated, with minimal side effects [^112KWYmQ].
- **Adherence**: Once-daily dosing improves adherence compared to ICS [^notfound].

---

## Biologic therapies

Biologic agents, such as omalizumab (anti-IgE), mepolizumab (anti-IL-5), and dupilumab (anti-IL-4 receptor), are reserved for children with **severe, refractory asthma** who remain uncontrolled despite optimal standard therapy [^113gNw6d] [^11246qvZ]. These therapies target specific inflammatory pathways and have shown significant efficacy in pediatric populations [^111DJ5mc].

- **Efficacy**: Biologics significantly reduce exacerbations, improve lung function, and enhance quality of life in children with severe asthma [^notfound].
- **Safety**: Biologics are generally well-tolerated, but long-term safety data in pediatric populations are still being evaluated [^116Fesf8].
- **Cost and access**: Biologics are expensive and may have limited availability, requiring specialist referral and careful patient selection [^111uCzH1] [^113gNw6d].

---

## Short-acting beta-agonists (SABA)

SABAs, such as albuterol, remain essential for **quick relief of acute symptoms** and exacerbations [^112GBa4E]. However, SABA-only therapy is discouraged due to increased risk of exacerbations and mortality [^1118YidJ] [^111uCzH1].

- **Efficacy**: SABAs provide rapid bronchodilation and symptom relief during acute episodes [^112GBa4E] [^116GSdob].
- **Safety**: Over-reliance on SABA without ICS increases the risk of severe exacerbations and mortality [^1118YidJ] [^111uCzH1].
- **Current guidelines**: SABA should always be used in conjunction with ICS-containing therapy [^111DJ5mc] [^114UsfUs].

---

## Age-specific considerations

| **Age group** | **Recommended controller therapy** | **Add-on therapy** | **Reliever therapy** |
|-|-|-|-|
| 0–5 years | - ICS (low-dose) <br/> - LTRA (alternative) | Not recommended | - SABA <br/> - ICS with SABA |
| 6–11 years | - ICS (low-dose) <br/> - ICS + LABA (if uncontrolled) | - LABA <br/> - LAMA (if uncontrolled) | - SABA <br/> - ICS-formoterol (if available) |
| ≥ 12 years | - ICS <br/> - ICS + LABA <br/> - ICS-formoterol (MART) | - LAMA <br/> - Biologics (if severe) | - SABA <br/> - ICS-formoterol (MART) |

---

## Emerging therapies and future directions

Recent advances include the development of **novel biologics**, improved inhaler devices, and digital health interventions to enhance adherence and monitoring [^1157nrHs] [^116n7fdz]. Personalized medicine approaches based on asthma phenotypes and biomarkers are also being explored to optimize treatment outcomes [^116mZk5s] [^116GedJP].

---

Inhaled corticosteroids remain the **most effective medication** for pediatric asthma, with LABA, LTRA, and biologics serving as important add-on therapies for specific patient populations. Treatment should be individualized based on age, severity, and phenotype, with regular monitoring and adjustment to achieve optimal asthma control [^113pQ9XK] [^113CD9Bg].

### Assessment of controversial pediatric asthma management options using GRADE [^113VGfpD]. Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Objectives

To develop explicit and transparent recommendations on controversial asthma management issues in children and to illustrate the usefulness of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach in rating the quality of evidence and strength of recommendations.

Methods

Health care questions were formulated for 3 controversies in clinical practice: what is the most effective treatment in asthma not under control with standard-dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS; step 3), the use of leukotriene receptor antagonist for viral wheeze, and the role of extra fine particle aerosols. GRADE was used to rate the quality of evidence and strength of recommendations after performing systematic literature searches. We provide evidence profiles and considerations about benefit and harm, preferences and values, and resource use, all of which played a role in formulating final recommendations.

Results

By applying GRADE and focusing on outcomes that are important to patients and explicit other considerations, our recommendations differ from those in other international guidelines. We prefer to double the dose of ICS instead of adding a long-acting β-agonist in step 3; ICS instead of leukotriene receptor antagonist are the first choice in preschool wheeze, and extra fine particle ICS formulations are not first-line treatment in children with asthma. Recommendations are weak and based on low-quality evidence for critical outcomes.

Conclusions

We provide systematically and transparently developed recommendations about controversial asthma management options. Using GRADE for guideline development may change recommendations, enhance guideline implementation, and define remaining research gaps.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^113pQ9XK]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Asthma pharmacotherapy for children of 5 years of age or younger — good control of asthma can be achieved in the overwhelming majority of young children with a pharmacological intervention strategy, and a stepwise treatment approach is recommended based on symptom patterns, risk of exacerbations and side-effects, and response to initial treatment; generally, treatment includes the daily, long-term use of low-dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) to keep asthma well controlled and reliever medications for as-needed symptom relief, and the choice of inhaler device is also an important consideration. When recommending treatment for a young child, both general and individual questions apply, including identifying the 'preferred' medication option at each treatment step to control asthma symptoms and minimize future risk, with decisions based on data for efficacy, effectiveness and safety from clinical trials and on observational data, considering that studies suggest factors such as allergic sensitization and/or peripheral blood count may help to better identify which children are more likely to have a short-term response to ICS, and accounting for response to previous treatment, patient characteristics that contribute to symptoms or risk of flare-ups, preferences of the parent/caregiver, and practical issues.

### New and future strategies to improve asthma control in children [^1157nrHs]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2015). Low credibility.

Symptomatic asthma in childhood has lifelong effects on lung function and disease severity, emphasizing the need for improved pediatric asthma control. Control of pediatric risk and impairment domains can be achieved through increased medication adherence or new therapeutic strategies. Developing electronic monitoring device technology with reminders might be a key noninvasive resource to address poor adherence in children and adolescents in a clinical setting. In patients who have persistently poor control despite optimal medication compliance, newly emerging pharmaceuticals, including inhaled therapies and biologics, might be key to their treatment. However, barriers exist to their development in the pediatric population, and insights must be drawn from adult studies, which has its own unique limitations. Biomarkers to direct the use of such potentially expensive therapies to those patients most likely to benefit are imperative. In this review the current literature regarding strategies to improve pediatric asthma control is addressed with the goal of exploring the potential and pitfalls of strategies that might be available in the near future.

### Personalized medicine and pediatric asthma [^116mZk5s]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Asthma is a heterogeneous disorder described by a large number of clinical features. A growing body of literature on more specific asthma phenotypes provides evidence for a phenotype-based approach to management in which specific therapies are recommended based on patient and disease characteristics. This understanding, coupled with an increase in the number of available therapies for children with asthma, as well as emerging therapies and phenotypic markers, will allow for improved asthma management in the future.

### Current trends in management of pediatric asthma [^112YsmQC]. Respiratory Care (2003). Low credibility.

Though asthma cannot be cured, it can be effectively controlled with existing treatments. Management strategies for acute and chronic asthma often vary substantially within and among medical facilities and practices, often driven by physician preference and familiarity rather than by data. The use of carefully designed care paths can improve quality of care and decrease management costs of acute asthma in both the emergency department and in-patient setting. Using newer beta agonists and attention to proper inhalation delivery systems may also improve outcomes and patient satisfaction. Assessment-driven care paths can be safely and effectively administered by respiratory therapists and nurses. The major controversies in the management of chronic asthma center on what to do for the patient who fails to respond to low or moderate doses of inhaled corticosteroids. The addition of a long-acting beta agonist or a leukotriene receptor antagonist may be beneficial.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^113CD9Bg]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Making decisions about asthma treatment — Asthma treatment is adjusted in a continual cycle of assessment, treatment, and review of the patient's response in both symptom control and future risk (of exacerbations and side-effects), and of patient preferences. For population-level decisions about asthma medications, the 'preferred' regimens in Steps 1–4 represent the best treatments for most patients based on evidence about safety, efficacy and effectiveness, with emphasis on symptom burden and exacerbation risk, and for Steps 1–5 there are different preferred population-level recommendations for adults/adolescents, children 6–11 years, and children 5 years and younger, with Step 5 also differing by inflammatory phenotype (Type 2 or non-Type 2). For individual patients, shared decision-making about treatment should also consider characteristics, phenotype or environmental exposures that predict risk or response, together with the patient's goals or concerns and practical issues (inhaler technique, adherence, medication access and cost to the patient). Optimize asthma management, including inhaled therapy and non-pharmacologic strategies, to reduce the need for oral corticosteroids (OCS) and their multiple associated adverse effects.

### Balancing safety and efficacy in the treatment of pediatric asthma [^112KWYmQ]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2002). Low credibility.

The treatment of pediatric asthma requires balancing the efficacy and safety of various asthma medications, facilitating patient and family education, and developing a supportive treatment network. The efficacy and safety of the major asthma controllers — cromolyn, long-acting beta(2)-agonists, inhaled corticosteroids, and leukotriene receptor antagonists-are well tolerated overall when used appropriately. Cromolyn is used often as first-line therapy in treating pediatric asthma, but the inhaled corticosteroids remain the cornerstone of pediatric asthma control. Long-acting beta(2)-agonists are most beneficial when used intermittently or in combination with other asthma medications. The most recent class of drugs, the leukotriene receptor antagonists are effective in controlling asthma and are well tolerated in children as young as 2 years of age. In moderate-to-severe pediatric asthma, combination therapy is often required to achieve optimal asthma control. Leukotriene receptor antagonists combined with inhaled corticosteroids reduce the need for steroid rescue, the rate of serious exacerbations, and the level of inflammation. The treatment of asthma requires the ability to diagnose and treat asthma effectively. In subpopulations with special needs such as very young or inner-city minority children, treating asthma requires a comprehensive approach that includes a supportive patient-physician relationship and the involvement of schools, churches, and neighborhood outreach programs that will identify children with asthma and promote quality care.

### Can early intervention in pediatric asthma improve long-term outcomes? A question that needs an answer [^111tqyP3]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2019). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Pediatric asthma is a chronic lung disease characterized by airflow obstruction and airway hyperresponsiveness. 1, 2 The 2018 Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) report defines two major long‐term goals of asthma management: (i) to maintain good control of symptoms with no restrictions on activity level and (ii) to limit future exacerbation risk, adverse effects, and fixed airflow limitation. 2 Additional goals of therapy include minimizing the necessity for short‐acting β 2 ‐agonist (SABA) use and preventing progressive loss of lung function. This concept of managing future risk is gaining momentum, yet only a small number of studies have investigated the long‐term effects of asthma treatment from childhood into adulthood. Furthermore, evidence‐based guidelines appear to have had little impact on improving outcomes, suggesting that a new approach is warranted. 3 The paradigm of childhood asthma management is shifting toward more personalized therapies and earlier intervention. 4, 5 In this narrative review, we discuss the current understanding of childhood asthma treatment, what is known about the long‐term effects of these treatments, and highlight open questions that remain.

### What is the impact of innovative electronic health interventions in improving treatment adherence in asthma? The pediatric perspective [^1153RYyx]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2019). Medium credibility.

Suboptimal adherence to treatment is a significant issue in the management of pediatric asthma and is a major cause of uncontrolled disease, life-threatening attacks, and increased use of health care resources. Electronic health solutions have the potential to positively impact asthma self-management in children and adolescents and their families, thereby improving treatment adherence and asthma outcomes. However, there is a lack of sufficient data to support widespread adoption of electronic health tools in pediatric asthma practice. A critical evaluation of the impact of these new interventions on treatment adherence in childhood asthma must consider unmet needs, heterogeneity of trials, safety and data security issues, long-term effects, and cost-effectiveness. This article explores the most relevant issues facing the role of electronic health and its subcategory-mobile health-in promoting treatment adherence in childhood asthma, focusing on current evidence gaps and limitations, and future research perspectives.

### Asthma across childhood: improving adherence to asthma management from early childhood to adolescence [^111h7LRR]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2020). Medium credibility.

Asthma affects nearly 6 million US children. Throughout childhood, children undergo a series of biological, developmental, and psychosocial changes. Thus, factors influencing a child's asthma management differ across 3 essential stages-early childhood (0–5 years), school-aged years (5–12 years), and adolescence (12–18 years)-and require varied intervention by parents, school personnel, clinicians, and the children themselves. Because asthma care in children is characterized by fluctuations in severity and coordination among many stakeholders, optimal asthma control is difficult to achieve in this young population. Challenges in childhood asthma management are reflected in the low rates of children's adherence to medication regimes. Although pharmacological and biological factors addressing age in physicians' treatment choices are well outlined, age-specific approaches to patient-provider communication and asthma-related interventions are also important in improving quality of life for patients with pediatric asthma.

### Asthma across the ages: knowledge gaps in childhood asthma [^111DFKJQ]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2014). Low credibility.

The Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development convened an Asthma Group in response to the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act. The overall goal of the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act Program is to improve pediatric therapeutics through preclinical and clinical drug trials that lead to drug-labeling changes. Although significant advances have been made in the understanding and management of asthma in adults with appropriately labeled medications, less information is available on the management of asthma in children. Indeed, many medications are inadequately labeled for use in children. In general, the younger the child, the less information there is available to guide clinicians. Because asthma often begins in early childhood, it is incumbent on us to continue to address the primary questions raised in this review and carefully evaluate the medications used to manage asthma in children. Meanwhile, continued efforts should be made in defining effective strategies that reduce the risk of exacerbations. If the areas of defined need are addressed in the coming years, namely prevention of exacerbations and progression of disease, as well as primary intervention, we will see continuing reduction in asthma mortality and morbidity along with improved quality of life for children with asthma.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^115AemWM]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Asthma review frequency — adults, adolescents and children 6–11 years — states that each patient's asthma should be reviewed regularly to monitor control, risk factors and exacerbations and to document response to treatment changes; for most controller medications improvement begins within days but the full benefit may only be reached after 3–4 months; all healthcare providers should be encouraged to assess asthma control, adherence and inhaler technique at every visit; and ideally patients should be seen 1–3 months after starting treatment and every 3–12 months thereafter, with a review visit within 1 week scheduled after an exacerbation.

### Challenges in the treatment of asthma in children and adolescents [^114H63wk]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

Despite the availability of effective treatments, asthma control in children and adolescents remains inadequate and rates of health care use are high. This follow-up to a recent review (O'Byrne et al, Eur Respir J. 2017;50[3]) examines a number of challenges in current pediatric asthma management compared with that of an adult perspective and discusses possible alternative strategies that might improve pediatric asthma management and control.

Data Sources

The evidence base for this review is limited because, historically, much of the research has been performed in adults.

Study Selections

Not applicable.

Results

Pediatric asthma management is complicated by variability in asthma severity and control and difficulty in measuring pulmonary function and airway inflammation. Current challenges in pediatric asthma management include the recommended initial therapy treating only the symptoms rather than the underlying inflammation and switching to controller therapy only when asthma subsequently worsens.

Conclusion

Alternative strategies that might improve pediatric asthma management and control include replacement of short-acting β 2 -agonist relievers by an inhaled corticosteroid plus a fast-acting β 2 -agonist (short-acting β 2 -agonist or fast- and long-acting β 2 -agonist) combination at Global Initiative for Asthma step 1 or 2 to ensure that patients receive an inhaled corticosteroid whenever they feel the need for symptomatic relief. Such an approach could eliminate the problem of learned overuse or over-reliance on short-acting β 2 -agonist reliever medication and address the other challenges in current pediatric asthma management. Clinical studies in pediatric patients or large studies involving a proportion of pediatric patients are required to provide the supporting evidence needed to help advance such new approaches and improve asthma control from a pediatric perspective.

### Weighing the risks of treatment versus nontreatment in pediatric asthma [^1171cNYf]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

During the past dozen years, great strides have been made in the understanding of asthma. In addition, an excellent choice of effective and safe medications has become available for use in both the acute and chronic manifestations of this disease. Unfortunately, asthma continues to affect society adversely in terms of cost and morbidity. Following the NHLBI guidelines for the management of persistent asthma could substantially reduce the health care expenditures associated with asthma and, more importantly could significantly reduce asthma exacerbations, emergent care visits, hospitalizations, and even asthma deaths. All who care for children with asthma must continue to relay the message that asthma is a chronic condition that is best treated with controller agents. Inhaled glucocorticoids are considered first-line agents for all patients with persistent asthma. They have been shown to improve asthma control, improve lung function, and reduce morbidity and mortality. Whether the leukotriene-modifying agents will be shown to reduce morbidity and mortality significantly remains an important and unanswered question at present. Another important question is whether combination therapy and which combination (inhaled glucocorticoid plus LABA or inhaled glucocorticoid plus leukotriene-modifying agent) will provide even further improvement in asthma control and further reductions in hospitalizations and mortality than seen with the use of inhaled glucocorticoids alone.

### Approaching current and new drug therapies for pediatric asthma [^117XFUfC]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

As new therapies for pediatric asthma are approved by the Food and Drug Administration, clinicians should be aware of their benefits and limitations. Accompanying these therapies are potential obstacles, including the delivery of inhaled therapies and age-specific issues regarding implementation and adherence. New insights are being added to well-established controller medications, including inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting β-agonists, while new medications previously approved in adults, including tiotropium and biologics, are now being evaluated for use in children. These drugs can be useful additive therapies to treat patients who are currently not responding to guidelines-based therapy.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^116dzaAS]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Goal of asthma management in young children — aims and care cycle are specified: as with other age groups, the goal is to achieve the best possible long-term asthma outcomes for the child, including to achieve and maintain good long-term control of symptoms and maintain normal activity levels, and to minimize future risk; that is to reduce the risk of flare-ups, maintain lung function and lung development as close to normal as possible, and minimize medication side-effects. The long-term goals are achieved through a partnership between the parent/caregiver and the health professional team, with a cycle of Assess (diagnosis, symptom control, risk factors, inhaler technique, adherence, parent preference), Adjust treatment (medications, non-pharmacological strategies, and treatment of modifiable risk factors), and Review response including medication effectiveness and side-effects.

### Step-up and step-down treatments for optimal asthma control in children and adolescents [^116KE8Bk]. The Journal of Asthma (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

To review therapeutic options for stepwise management of pediatric asthma in the context of this population's unique needs such as potential effects of asthma, treatments, or both on growth and psychosocial development, and caregiver involvement.

Data Sources and Study Selection

We conducted PubMed searches to identify relevant articles then reviewed resultant articles, guidelines for asthma management in children, and articles from personal files.

Results

Stepwise management of asthma, similar to adults, is recommended for children in current global and US guidelines. Treatment may be stepped up or stepped down temporarily or long-term based on response over time. Inhaled corticosteroids remain the recommended treatment for persistent childhood asthma and any potential small effects on growth are considered relatively minor compared with their benefit. Controller medication options for patients < 18years old are limited, especially for Global Initiative for Asthma Steps 2–5. The long-acting antimuscarinic antagonist tiotropium (Steps 4/5, patients aged ≥ 12years) and in certain circumstances (Step 5), anti-immunoglobulin E (aged ≥ 6years) and interleukin-5 antibodies (aged ≥ 12years) are newer treatment options. Tiotropium is indicated in the United States and Europe for patients ≥ 6years old. Stepping down treatment, which is recommended but infrequently practiced, can maintain symptom control and minimize adverse events while substantially reducing costs. Patient education and better monitoring remain important for self-management and optimum outcomes.

Conclusion

A need exists to target individual treatment goals for children with asthma by using step-up and step-down approaches to maximize treatment benefits and minimize potential adverse effects.

### Optimizing pediatric asthma management: implementation and evaluation of anti-inflammatory reliever and single maintenance and reliever therapies [^116MEyA8]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

Asthma is one of the most prevalent chronic disorders in children. Anti-inflammatory reliever (AIR) therapy and single maintenance and reliever therapy (SMART) have been adopted into the asthma management of adolescents and adults. However, limited evidence and guidance are currently available for asthma management of younger children with AIR therapy and SMART. Despite the potential benefits of these therapies, the evidence supporting their safety and efficacy in early childhood is evolving. Our review summarizes the current evidence regarding the risks and benefits of AIR therapy and SMART. Moreover, we also identified commonly known challenges of adopting AIR therapy and SMART for younger children as well as proposed potential solutions. Our review aims to offer a foundation for future research and clinical guidance to serve younger patients who could benefit from AIR therapy and SMART. This insight could ultimately lead to safer, more effective, and widely accessible asthma management options for children.

### Diagnosis and management of asthma in children [^113JeSp3]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2022). High credibility.

Conclusions

Paediatric asthma outcomes are currently poor and many deaths are preventable. The aim should be to avoid asthma attacks occurring with appropriate maintenance therapy, and they should be viewed as never events. In order to improve outcomes, accurate diagnosis and management are essential. Good asthma care extends beyond providing medication and should include education, as well as supported self-management advice. The use of PAAPs remains limited and a significant number of young people with asthma do not have one. Postattack asthma reviews are a key opportunity to review maintenance medication and current symptom control.

### Efficacy of non-pharmacological interventions for childhood asthma: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^1119YkWJ]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Although non-pharmacological interventions for pediatric asthma have been widely studied, the absence of head-to-head comparative evaluations and meta-analytic integration limits evidence-based prioritization of therapeutic strategies. Network meta-analysis (NMA) is a robust statistical methodology that enables simultaneous comparison of multiple interventions through direct and indirect evidence. This approach facilitates efficacy ranking across therapeutic options and identifies optimal treatment strategies by synthesizing all available comparative data. In this study, we employ NMA to systematically evaluate the relative effectiveness of diverse non-pharmacological adjunctive interventions for childhood asthma, with the ultimate goal of informing evidence-based clinical decision-making. This study will help clinicians and families of pediatric patients to better manage childhood asthma through non-invasive, non-pharmacological measures, thereby achieving prevention and treatment goals.

Asthma is a complex heterogeneous disease characterized by reversible airflow obstruction. After appropriate diagnosis, the management in school-aged children centers on 3 broad domains: pharmacologic treatment, treatment of underlying comorbidities, and education of the patient and caregivers. It is important to understand that the phenotypic differences that exist in the school-aged child with asthma may impact underlying comorbid conditions as well as pharmacologic treatment choices. Following initiation of therapy, asthma control must be continually evaluated in order to optimize management.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^112mHdrC]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Box 3–4. Population-level versus patient-level decisions about asthma treatment — population-level selection states that when choosing between treatment options at a population level (e.g., national formularies, health maintenance organizations, national guidelines), the 'preferred' medication at each step is the best treatment for most patients, based on efficacy, effectiveness, safety, and availability and cost at the population level, mainly based on evidence about symptoms and exacerbations (from randomized controlled trials, pragmatic studies and strong observational data). For Steps 1–5, there are different population-level recommendations by age-group (adults/adolescents, children 6–11 years, children 5 years and younger), and in Step 5, there are also different population-level recommendations depending on the inflammatory phenotype, Type 2 or non-Type 2.

### Difficult-to-treat asthma management in school-age children [^11246qvZ]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2022). Medium credibility.

The World Health Organization divides severe asthma into three categories: untreated severe asthma; difficult-to-treat severe asthma; and severe, therapy-resistant asthma. The apparent frequency of severe asthma in the general population of asthmatic children is probably around 5%. Upon referral of these children, it is important to evaluate the diagnosis of asthma carefully before modifying management and applying a long-term monitoring plan. Identification of pathophysiologic phenotypes using objective biomarkers is essential in our routine assessments of severe asthma. Although conventional pharmacologic approaches should be attempted first, there is growing recognition that children with difficult-to-treat asthma may have unique clinical phenotypes that may necessitate alternative treatment approaches including asthma biologics. These new medications, especially those with effects on multiple pathologic features of asthma, raise the hope that new treatment strategies could induce remission. Besides introducing new medications, the opportunity for closer monitoring is feasible with advances in digital health. Therefore, we have the opportunity to improve response to medications, individualize treatment, and monitor response along with potential steps to prevent severe asthma.

### Can early intervention in pediatric asthma improve long-term outcomes? A question that needs an answer [^112rg5FU]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2019). Medium credibility.

9 HETEROGENEITY IN TREATMENT RESPONSE

Children that present with asthma exacerbations generally have more severe disease and signs of eosinophilic inflammation. 74 According to recent estimates, approximately 38% of children with asthma have uncontrolled disease, and 52% of children with uncontrolled asthma were already taking long‐term controller medications. 75 In addition, some children whose asthma is still not controlled despite ICS therapy respond to other standard therapies differently. 76 Another issue to consider is difficult‐to‐treat asthma, defined by the need for multiple medications, frequent and/or severe exacerbations, inability to avoid triggers, and complicated treatment regimens. 77 Although this type of asthma is not a phenotype as defined by treatment guidelines, it can describe asthma of any severity level and is likely to contribute to the population of children with uncontrolled asthma. Overall, efficacy can be difficult to demonstrate in young children due to the confounding influences of socioeconomic status, race/ethnicity, and comorbidities, as well as the heterogeneity of asthma itself.

### Update on national asthma education and prevention program pediatric asthma treatment recommendations [^11144Rk9]. Clinical Pediatrics (2004). Low credibility.

The National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (NAEPP) published an update on selected topics from the 1997 Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Asthma and provided new evidence-based recommendations for asthma treatment. Selected topics on the long-term management of asthma in children addressed the efficacy of inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) compared with other asthma medications (i.e., as-needed beta(2)-adrenergic agonists and other controllers) in mild and moderate persistent asthma and the safety of long-term ICS use. The effects of early intervention with ICSs on asthma progression also were evaluated. An important new aspect of the treatment update entails the recommendation of ICSs as the controller medication of choice for all severities of persistent asthma in children. Additionally, on the basis of studies in adults, the Expert Panel suggested that long-acting beta(2)-adrenergic agonists are now the preferred adjunct to ICSs in children with moderate or severe persistent asthma. Based on long-term data in children, ICS therapy was deemed safe in terms of growth, bone mineral density, ocular effects, and hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis function. Although members of the NAEPP Expert Panel determined that the effects of early intervention with ICSs on decline in lung function have not been adequately studied, they found that the effects on asthma control were substantial.

Asthma is a complex, multifactorial, and inflammatory chronic condition, and many children who are diagnosed with asthma integrate complementary therapies into their overall care. Due to the chronic nature of asthma, potentially negative side effects of long-term use of allopathic medications, and desire for natural approaches, patients and their families turn toward complementary therapies. Up to 89% of parents use complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) to treat their child's asthma. This article reviews the current evidence on the most commonly used complementary therapies for pediatric asthma.

### Systematic review of digital interventions for pediatric asthma management [^116n7fdz]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Pediatric patients with asthma take only approximately half of their prescribed medication. Digital interventions to improve adherence for youth with asthma exist and have the potential to improve accessibility, cost-effectiveness, and customizability.

Objective

To systematically review published research examining digital interventions to promote adherence to the treatment of pediatric asthma.

Methods

A systematic search of the PubMed, Scopus, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and reference review databases was conducted. Articles were included if adherence was an outcome in a randomized controlled trial of a digital intervention for children with asthma. We compared samples, intervention characteristics, adherence measurement and outcomes, as well as additional health outcomes across studies.

Results

Of the 264 articles reviewed, 15 studies met inclusion criteria and were included in the review. Overall, 87% of the digital interventions demonstrated improved adherence and 53% demonstrated improved health outcomes. All the promising interventions included a behavioral component and most were 3 to 6 months in length, delivered through a digital stand-alone medium (eg, automated personalized texts, mobile health apps, and website), and assessed adherence to controller medication.

Conclusions

Overall, digital interventions aimed at improving adherence are promising and also improve health outcomes in addition to medication adherence. Although future studies using evidence-based adherence assessment and multifactorial design should be conducted, the current literature suggests that both digital stand-alone interventions and interventions combining digital technology with support from a health care team member result in improved adherence and asthma outcomes. Recommendations for digital interventions for pediatric patients with asthma with adherence concerns are provided.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis and management of asthma in children 5 years and younger [^113HSkDw]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2011). Low credibility.

Asthma is the most common chronic disease of childhood and the leading cause of childhood morbidity from chronic disease as measured by school absences, emergency department visits, and hospitalisation. During the past two decades, many scientific advances have improved our understanding of asthma and our ability to manage and control it effectively. However, in children 5 years and younger, the clinical symptoms of asthma are variable and non-specific. Furthermore, neither airflow limitation nor airway inflammation, the main pathologic hallmarks of the condition, can be assessed routinely in this age group. For this reason, to aid in the diagnosis of asthma in young children, a symptoms-only descriptive approach that includes the definition of various wheezing phenotypes has been recommended. In 1993, the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) was implemented to develop a network of individuals, organizations, and public health officials to disseminate information about the care of patients with asthma while at the same time assuring a mechanism to incorporate the results of scientific investigations into asthma care. Since then, GINA has developed and regularly revised a Global Strategy for Asthma Management and Prevention. Publications based on the Global Strategy for Asthma Management and Prevention have been translated into many different languages to promote international collaboration and dissemination of information. In this report, Global Strategy for Asthma Management and Prevention in Children 5 Years and Younger, an effort has been made to present the special challenges that must be taken into account in managing asthma in children during the first 5 years of life, including difficulties with diagnosis, the efficacy and safety of drugs and drug delivery systems, and the lack of data on new therapies. Approaches to these issues will vary among populations in the world based on socioeconomic conditions, genetic diversity, cultural beliefs, and differences in healthcare access and delivery. Patients in this age group are often managed by pediatricians and general practitioners routinely faced with a wide variety of issues related to childhood diseases.

### Global Initiative for Asthma strategy 2021: executive summary and rationale for key changes [^1118YidJ]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

The Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) Strategy Report provides clinicians with an annually updated evidence-based strategy for asthma management and prevention, which can be adapted for local circumstances (e.g., medication availability). This article summarizes key recommendations from GINA 2021, and the evidence underpinning recent changes. GINA recommends that asthma in adults and adolescents should not be treated solely with short-acting β 2 -agonist (SABA), because of the risks of SABA-only treatment and SABA overuse, and evidence for benefit of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). Large trials show that as-needed combination ICS-formoterol reduces severe exacerbations by ⩾60% in mild asthma compared with SABA alone, with similar exacerbation, symptom, lung function, and inflammatory outcomes as daily ICS plus as-needed SABA. Key changes in GINA 2021 include division of the treatment figure for adults and adolescents into two tracks. Track 1 (preferred) has low-dose ICS-formoterol as the reliever at all steps: as needed only in Steps 1–2 (mild asthma), and with daily maintenance ICS-formoterol (maintenance-and-reliever therapy, "MART") in Steps 3–5. Track 2 (alternative) has as-needed SABA across all steps, plus regular ICS (Step 2) or ICS-long-acting β 2 -agonist (Steps 3–5). For adults with moderate-to-severe asthma, GINA makes additional recommendations in Step 5 for add-on long-acting muscarinic antagonists and azithromycin, with add-on biologic therapies for severe asthma. For children 6–11 years, new treatment options are added at Steps 3–4. Across all age groups and levels of severity, regular personalized assessment, treatment of modifiable risk factors, self-management education, skills training, appropriate medication adjustment, and review remain essential to optimize asthma outcomes.

### New directions in pediatric asthma [^111zNhoK]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Childhood asthma affects many children placing them at significant risk for health care utilization and school absences. Several new developments relevant to the field of pediatric asthma have occurred over the last 5 years; yet, there is much more to learn. It is poorly understood how to prevent the disease, optimally address environmental challenges, or effectively manage poor adherence. Moreover, it is not clear how to customize therapy by asthma phenotype, age group, high risk groups, or severity of disease. Highlights of advances in pediatric asthma are reviewed and multiple essential areas for further exploration and research are discussed.

### Advances in pediatric asthma 2006 [^114xPQZb]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2007). Low credibility.

Because the outcomes experienced in adult asthma often result from pathophysiology that begins in early childhood, this year's summary focuses on recent advances in pediatric asthma. This past year, we have learned that early intervention with inhaled corticosteroids in childhood asthma reduces morbidity but does not alter the natural history of asthma. Theme issues over the last year focused attention on severe asthma and black box warnings. Both of these themes significantly affect the management of childhood asthma. Responsiveness to asthma treatment is heterogeneous even among patients with asthma of similar severity. This heterogeneity calls attention to the importance of assessing control and adjusting treatment accordingly. We are now moving toward an individualized approach to asthma therapy and searching for biomarkers and genetics as a resource to guide treatment. To improve asthma control, we must continue to obtain information on early asthma, severe asthma, asthma exacerbations, and methods to improve asthma control. Evaluation and management of severe asthma in children include verification of the diagnosis, assessment for coexisting illnesses, and identification of effective treatment strategies directed to adherence, medication delivery, and combination therapy. Application of biomarkers and genetics could be useful tools in individualizing our approach to the management of childhood asthma.

### Management of acute, severe asthma in children [^111xg7yE]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To briefly present the current options available for the treatment of acute, severe asthma in children, with a special focus on emergency department and inpatient treatment, and to describe newer therapies that may aid treatment in the future.

Data Sources and Study Selection

A MEDLINE search (1966-May 2001) of the English-language literature pertaining to drug therapy of acute asthma was performed. Key word searches included acute asthma, albuterol, ipratropium, corticosteroids, magnesium, and theophylline. Additional articles from these sources and published national guidelines were identified. Relevant studies pertaining to current therapy of acute asthma in pediatric patients were selected; if there were minimal pediatric data, adult data were included.

Data Synthesis

Asthma is a chronic, inflammatory disorder of the airways. Acute exacerbations can occur and are challenging to manage. Albuterol, ipratropium, and systemic corticosteroids have been shown to be effective in acute asthma exacerbations. Because some patients do not respond to maximal therapy, older therapies such as magnesium and theophylline are being reevaluated. Theophylline may have some therapeutic effect, but given its toxicity profile, it is unclear whether it offers any advantage over maximal beta(2)-agonist therapy. There are only minimal published data evaluating the use of magnesium in pediatrics, and most are small trials or case reports. Newer therapies such as ventilation strategies with heliox and intravenous leukotriene modifiers currently being evaluated may or may not prove to be beneficial in the future.

Conclusions

beta(2)-agonists, ipratropium, and corticosteroids remain the most useful therapeutic agents for acute asthma exacerbations in pediatric patients. However, these agents are not ideal in all patients and, given the existing questions regarding safety and/or efficacy of available alternatives, more effective options are needed.

### New insights into the treatment of severe asthma in children [^112akKt7]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Severe asthma accounts for 0.5% of the general paediatric population and 4.5% of children with asthma, representing the major burden of asthma-health-care-associated costs. After ensuring a diagnosis of asthma and excluding difficult-to-treat patients with co-morbidities and non-adherence profiles, there remains children with real therapy-resistant asthma for whom the recommendations are to treat beyond guidelines. We describe new insights into the treatment of severe asthma in children, regarding both "classic drugs" (corticosteroids, bronchodilators) and innovative biological therapies targeting airway inflammation and impaired innate immunity. All of these new avenues remain to be studied and validated in children and will require fine clinical and biological phenotyping.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^114UsfUs]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Medications and strategies for adults, adolescents and children 6–11 years — For safety, GINA does not recommend treating asthma with short-acting beta2 agonist (SABA) alone and states patients should receive inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)-containing treatment; ICS may be given as regular daily treatment or, in adults and adolescents with less-than-daily symptoms and normal or mildly reduced lung function, as as-needed low-dose ICS-formoterol for symptom relief, and for children not likely to be adherent with maintenance ICS the ICS can be taken whenever the child uses their SABA reliever; reduction in severe exacerbations is a high priority to lessen patient and health-system burden and the need for oral corticosteroids (OCS); tables of low, medium or high dose ICS do not represent equivalent potency and if a patient is switched between medications, they should be monitored for stability.

### Controversies in the management of preschool asthma [^114Niabf]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

Preschool asthma - one of the most common pediatric conditions - continues to spark significant debate around its management. In this article, we critically examine controversies in preschool asthma management by focusing on definition, diagnosis, management goals, acute and routine management, patient advocacy, and care coordination. We address controversial questions around the definition of preschool asthma, the role of biomarkers, the efficacy of oral corticosteroids in preschool asthma attacks, the use of maintenance inhaled corticosteroids, the use of montelukast, and the possible use of targeted antibiotics. Furthermore, we emphasize the critical role of structured preschool asthma management plans and the involvement of nursery teachers and nurses in optimizing preschool asthma care. Overall, our review supports a shift towards individualized treatment strategies and improved healthcare coordination. Future research should prioritize the validation of predictive biomarkers to refine individualized treatment decisions that will be evaluated against patient-reported outcomes. To this direction, we make suggestions about the development and validation of biomarkers and different approaches in clinical trials design.

### Asthma update [^112whHmD]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Asthma continues to be one of the most common reasons for emergency department visits and a leading cause of hospitalization. Acute management involves severity-based treatment of bronchoconstriction and underlying airway inflammation. Optimal treatment has been defined and standardized through randomized controlled trials, systematic reviews, and consensus guidelines. Implementation of clinical practice guidelines may improve clinical, quality, and safety outcomes. Asthma morbidity is disproportionately high in poor, urban, and minority children. Children treated in emergency departments commonly have persistent chronic severity, significant morbidity, and infrequent follow-up and primary asthma care, and prescription of inhaled corticosteroids is appropriate.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^111DJ5mc]. GINA (2025). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for asthma, more specifically with respect to pediatric patients (stepwise management), GINA 2025 guidelines recommend to use the following track as the preferred stepwise approach to the management of asthma in pediatric patients aged 6–11 years, with as-needed short-acting β-agonist or low-dose ICS-formoterol as the reliever in Steps 3 and 4:

| **Situation** | **Guidance** |
|-|-|
|Step 1. Symptoms ≤ 1–2 days per week|- Offer low-dose ICS whenever short-acting β-agonist is taken <br/> -, in separate inhalers or in combination if available|
|Step 2.

|Step 3. Symptoms on most days of the week or waking due to asthma ≥ 1 per week|- Offer low-dose ICS-LABA plus as-needed short-acting β-agonist <br/> - Offer medium-dose ICS plus as-needed short-acting β-agonist <br/> -; offer very low-dose ICS-formoterol maintenance-and-reliever therapy <br/> -; consider offering daily low-dose ICS or leukotriene receptor antagonist, plus as-needed short-acting β-agonist as a non-preferred option|
|Step 4. Symptoms daily, waking at night ≥ 1 per week, low lung function|- Offer medium-dose maintenance ICS-LABA plus as-needed short-acting β-agonist <br/> - Offer low-dose ICS-formoterol maintenance-and-reliever therapy <br/> - Consider referring for expert advice|
|Step 5.|- Refer for phenotypic assessment <br/> - Offer higher-dose ICS-LABA <br/> - Offer add-on therapy, such as anti-IgE, anti-interleukin 4 receptor, or anti-interleukin 5 therapy|
|Initial presentation with exacerbation|- Treat as for exacerbation, including a short course of oral corticosteroids if severe <br/> - Offer Step 3 or 4 treatment, and arrange follow-up|

### Asthma management in children [^111AU5kR]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

Asthma is a common, complex heterogeneous disease often beginning in early life and is characterized by reversible airflow obstruction. The phenotypic differences that exist in children with asthma may impact underlying comorbid conditions and pharmacologic treatment choices. Prenatal factors for increased risk of asthma could include maternal diet and the maternal microbiome. Evidence also suggests that postnatal microbial exposures and colonization contribute to the risk of allergic diseases and asthma. After confirming the diagnosis, asthma management in children centers on 3 broad areas: pharmacologic treatment, treatment of underlying comorbidities, and education of the patient and caregivers on the importance of adherence and device technique. Moreover, social determinants of health significantly impact on symptom burden and treatment response.

### Children with difficult asthma: a practical approach [^111NTWTG]. The Journal of Asthma (2001). Low credibility.

Many open studies investigating the effects of innovative treatments for steroid-dependent asthma demonstrate some benefit. This is also true of the majority of placebo arms in placebo-controlled trials. This suggests that children with difficult asthma benefit from the high level of input that is typically provided in clinical trials, with or without additional medication. Such intensive management of patients, with the emphasis on establishing the diagnosis, improving adherence, and identifying provoking factors, is the key to optimizing asthma control for these children. For patients with genuinely severe asthma, despite high doses of conventional treatment, a greater understanding of the pathological basis of persistent symptoms is needed. Identification of different pathological subtypes of severe asthma should allow for more rational prescribing of asthma therapy, as well as the design of further trials of potential steroid-sparing treatments.

### It's time to start phenotyping our patients with asthma [^114vsa3J]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Advances in the management of pediatric asthma, including biologics, offer practitioners the ability to tailor therapies to individual patients. However, asthma treatment guidelines have not kept up with current studies. This review explores the current literature incorporating the use of phenotyping in pediatric patients with asthma to provide precision therapy. Biomarkers can be used to more accurately predict the development of asthma, identify features that may be associated with difficult-to-control or severe asthma, and forecast response to therapies. Biomarkers and other phenotypic data can also be helpful in patients with uncontrolled, severe asthma in the selection of a biologic therapy.

### The promise of and problems with evidence-based medicine for paediatric asthma management [^112LCgzF]. Allergy (2002). Low credibility.

The concept of 'evidence-based medicine' has now been in widespread use in clinical practice for over a decade. There are different types of clinical study, which may provide evidence on which to base clinical decisions, but some are much less robust than others. In making decisions about treatment, one of the highest levels of evidence in primary research is the randomized controlled trial. This study design has been used in clinical research for over 50 years. Systematic reviews of randomized controlled trial are scientific studies that review, critically appraise and, where appropriate, aggregate results from a number of different randomized controlled trials. They are increasingly being used throughout health care to provide guidance about treatment. Under the auspices of The Cochrane Collaboration, systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials are being conducted across the whole of health care. One of the most active areas for this work is within the field of asthma and clinicians are now able to access a large number of different systematic reviews on The Cochrane Library. If used appropriately, they can aid the clinician in making decisions about individual patients and provide a sound evidence base from which clinical guidelines can be developed.

### Pediatric acute asthma exacerbations: evaluation and management from emergency department to intensive care unit [^112GBa4E]. The Journal of Asthma (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

The goal of this report is to review available modalities for assessing and managing acute asthma exacerbations in pediatric patients, including some that are not included in current expert panel guidelines. While it is not our purpose to provide a comprehensive review of the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (NAEPP) guidelines, we review NAEPP-recommended treatments to provide the full range of treatments available for managing exacerbations with an emphasis on the continuum of care between the ER and ICU.

Data Sources

We searched PubMed using the following search terms in different combinations: asthma, children, pediatric, exacerbation, epidemiology, pathophysiology, guidelines, treatment, management, oxygen, albuterol, β2-agonist, anticholinergic, theophylline, corticosteroid, magnesium, heliox, BiPAP, ventilation, mechanical ventilation, non-invasive mechanical ventilation and respiratory failure. We attempted to weigh the evidence using the hierarchy in which meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) provide the strongest evidence, followed by individual RCTs, followed by observational studies. We also reviewed the NAEPP and Global Initiative for Asthma expert panel guidelines.

Results and Conclusions

Asthma is the most common chronic disease of childhood, and acute exacerbations are a significant burden to patients and to public health. Optimal assessment and management of exacerbations, including appropriate escalation of interventions, are essential to minimize morbidity and prevent mortality. While inhaled albuterol and systemic corticosteroids are the mainstay of exacerbation management, escalation may include interventions discussed in this review.

Pharmacological management

The pharmacological management of asthma involves two key components: maintenance and reliever therapies. Maintenance therapies are the mainstay of asthma management, and the treatment aim is that no reliever therapies are required. Use of reliever therapy suggests asthma control is poor.

An overview of maintenance and reliever therapies is outlined in tables 3 and 4, respectively. A stepwise approach to asthma management is encouraged, and pharmacological management varies on age, symptom control and the national guideline used. An overview of management approach in a number of national guidelines is summarised in table 5.

Maintenance therapies

Table 4
Reliever therapies

Summary of paediatric asthma national guidelines: focusing on management

Table 6
Biologic agents used in the management of asthma

GINA guidelines recommend dual ICS and short-acting beta-2 agonist (SABA) therapy to children over the age of 5.SABA monotherapy was previously the main management starting point; however, compared with combined treatment, SABA monotherapy has been shown to be associated with asthma mortality.SABA monotherapy is now only recommended by GINA for use in children aged 5 or less. As seen in table 5, GINA recommends symptom-driven ICS use, compared with daily ICS use, as initial therapy in children over 6 years of age. In comparison to daily ICS use, symptom-driven use has demonstrated a similar exacerbation risk and reduces the risk of ICS adverse effects.

Single maintenance and reliever therapy (SMART) inhalers are combined inhalers offering both maintenance and reliever therapy in those with asthma. These inhalers contain a number of maintenance and reliever therapies in different combinations. The use of these inhalers have been shown to reduce the risk of asthma attacks and emergency department (ED) admissions, improve lung function and decrease the need for reliever therapy. There is limited evidence in the effectiveness of SMART inhalers in children, but children over 12 years may be prescribed a SMART inhaler, which acts as both a maintenance and reliever therapy, if symptoms are not well controlled.

There are a number of biologic agents (table 6) that may be used in the management of paediatric asthma. These are endotype-specific, targeted therapies that should be used only under the supervision of specialists. Their availability and cost vary between countries and different healthcare systems. Detailed appraisal of the evidence base for their use is provided in the individual management guidelines and has been recently reviewed.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^115MkVWQ]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Asthma management cycle for personalized asthma care involves a continual cycle of assessment, adjustment of treatment and review. Assess the patient's symptom control and their risk factors for exacerbations, for decline in lung function and for medication adverse effects, with particular attention to inhaler technique and adherence; assess comorbidities and the patient's goals and preferences, and confirm the diagnosis of asthma if not yet done. Adjust the patient's management based on these assessments, including treatment of modifiable risk factors and comorbidities, relevant non-pharmacologic strategies, education and skills training, and adjustment of medication as required; for adults and adolescents, the preferred controller and reliever treatment across all steps is with combination ICS-formoterol, as shown in GINA Track 1. Review the patient in line with the goals of treatment, reassess factors affecting symptoms, risk of adverse outcomes and patient satisfaction, arrange further investigations if needed, and readjust treatment if needed.

### Intermittent versus daily inhaled corticosteroids for persistent asthma in children and adults [^111xgFUq]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Daily inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are the recommended mainstay of treatment in children and adults with persistent asthma. However, often, ICS are used intermittently by patients or recommended by physicians to be used only at the onset of exacerbations.

Objectives

The aim of this review was to compare the efficacy and safety of intermittent versus daily ICS in the management of children and adults with persistent asthma and preschool-aged children suspected of persistent asthma.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register of trials (CAGR) and the ClinicalTrials.gov web site up to October 2012.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared intermittent ICS versus daily ICS in children and adults with persistent asthma. No co-interventions were permitted other than rescue relievers and oral corticosteroids used during exacerbations.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion, methodological quality and extracted data. The primary efficacy outcome was the number of patients with one or more exacerbations requiring oral corticosteroids and the primary safety outcome was the number of patients with serious adverse health events. Secondary outcomes included exacerbations, lung function tests, asthma control, adverse effects, withdrawal rates and inflammatory markers. Equivalence was assumed if the risk ratio (RR) estimate and its 95% confidence interval (CI) were between 0.9 and 1.1. Quality of the evidence was assessed using GRADE.

Main Results

Six trials (including one trial testing two relevant protocols) met the inclusion criteria for a total of seven group comparisons. The four paediatric trials (two involving preschool children and two school-aged children) and two adult parallel-group trials, lasting 12 to 52 weeks, were of high methodological quality. A total of 1211 patients with confirmed, or suspected, persistent asthma contributed to the meta-analyses. There was no statistically significant group difference in the risk of patients experiencing one or more exacerbations requiring oral corticosteroids (1204 patients; RR 1.07; 95% CI 0.87 to 1.32; the large confidence interval translates into a risk of exacerbations in the intermittent ICS group varying between 17% and 25%, assuming a 19% risk with daily ICS). Age, severity of airway obstruction, step-up protocol used during exacerbations and trial duration did not significantly influence the primary efficacy outcome. No group difference was observed in the risk of patients with serious adverse health events (1055 patients; RR 0.82; 95% CI 0.33 to 2.03). Compared to the daily ICS group, the intermittent ICS group displayed a smaller improvement in change from baseline peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) by 2.56% (95% CI -4.49% to -0.63%), fewer symptom-free days (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.15 (95% CI -0.28 to -0.03), fewer asthma control days -9% (95% CI -14% to -4%), more use of rescue β2-agonists by 0.12 puffs/day (95% CI 0 to 0.23) and a greater increase from baseline in exhaled nitric oxide of 16.80 parts per billion (95% CI 11.95 to 21.64). There was no significant group difference in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), quality of life, airway hyper-reactivity, adverse effects, hospitalisations, emergency department visits or withdrawals. In paediatric trials, intermittent ICS (budesonide and beclomethasone) were associated with greater growth by 0.41 cm change from baseline (532 children; 95% CI 0.13 to 0.69) compared to daily treatment.

Authors' Conclusions

In children and adults with persistent asthma and in preschool children suspected of persistent asthma, there was low quality evidence that intermittent and daily ICS strategies were similarly effective in the use of rescue oral corticosteroids and the rate of severe adverse health events. The strength of the evidence means that we cannot currently assume equivalence between the two options. Daily ICS was superior to intermittent ICS in several indicators of lung function, airway inflammation, asthma control and reliever use. Both treatments appeared safe, but a modest growth suppression was associated with daily, compared to intermittent, inhaled budesonide and beclomethasone. Clinicians should carefully weigh the potential benefits and harm of each treatment option, taking into account the unknown long-term (> one year) impact of intermittent therapy on lung growth and lung function decline.

### 2022 year in review: pediatric asthma [^116hw69G]. Respiratory Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Asthma is the most common chronic disease in children. Asthma is a heterogeneous disease characterized by variable, reversible airway obstruction and hyper-responsive airways. There is a high economic burden due to a child having poorly controlled asthma with one or more asthma exacerbations resulting in an emergency department visit or hospitalization in a year. Publications on diagnosis, treatment, and management of pediatric asthma are ongoing with over 2,549 papers published from January-November 2022. The intent of this paper is to summarize 8 key topics that have prompted discussions with local, regional, and national asthma experts due to a shift in clinical practice or lessons learned from the recent pandemic that may have future application.

Asthma Management in Low-Resource Settings

GINA 2021 is a global strategy relevant to the care of all children, adolescents, and adults with asthma, wherever they live. Most of the global burden of asthma morbidity and mortality occurs in low-income and middle-income countries because of lack of necessary resources for effective long-term asthma care. GINA has identified ongoing lack of access to ICS as a serious concern, especially as they can be produced at low cost. The safest and most effective approach to asthma treatment in adolescents and adults, which also avoids the consequences of starting treatment with SABA alone, depends on access to ICS–formoterol across all asthma severity levels. However, despite listing of budesonide–formoterol on WHO's Essential Medicines List, affordable access is very limited in many low-resource settings. The urgent need to ensure access to affordable, quality-assured inhaled asthma medications as part of universal health coverage must now be prioritized by all relevant stakeholders, particularly manufacturers of inhalers on the WHO Essential Medicines List.

Withdrawing management/stepping down

Asthma control should be reviewed at every medical contact. When asthma symptoms are well controlled on pharmacological therapy, stopping or stepping down medication should be considered to protect young people from unnecessary adverse effects.

The GINA 2021 guidelines advise that clinicians should consider stepping down asthma management to the lowest effective treatment regimen when good symptom control has been achieved for at least 3 months. When stepping down treatment, an individualised risk–benefit approach should be taken with focus on the child's medical history, including frequency of oral corticosteroid use, frequency of asthma attacks, and previous intensive or high-dependency care admissions.

### Features of successful interventions to improve adherence to inhaled corticosteroids in children with asthma: a narrative systematic review [^114MBJ84]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2022). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

1.1

Asthma is the most common, chronic noncommunicable disease in children worldwide. Asthma prevalence is higher in children in Europe (8.9%), compared with the rest of the world (7.2%)but varies between countries. Most children with asthma achieve good disease control with maintenance low‐dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), which are effective at preventing most asthma hospitalizations and deaths. However, some children remain poorly controlled despite being prescribed high‐dose ICS treatment, often due to poor adherence. This contributes to suboptimal asthma control and severe attacks. Up to half of patients attending tertiary care pediatric asthma clinics are nonadherent (defined as taking < 80% of their prescribed dose).

The Global Initiate for Asthma (GINA) highlights that suboptimal use of asthma treatment is a patient‐specific barrier that contributes to the burden of asthma. Similarly, the UK National Review of Asthma Deaths reported that 67% of asthma deaths were avoidable and one of the most important avoidable factors was low ICS adherence in the month and/or year before death.

### SMART-is it practical in the United States? [^116Fwu3c]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines by the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program Coordinating Committee Expert Panel Working Group advocate for inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)-formoterol combinations as single maintenance and reliever therapy (SMART) for patients with persistent asthma. We review the rationale, the evidence supporting SMART use in asthma, and barriers limiting its wide adoption in the United States.

Recent Findings

A growing body of evidence supports the use of SMART over the conventional use of controller medicaments with an as-needed short-acting β2 agonist for rescue therapy for the purpose of reducing the risk of asthma exacerbation and maintaining asthma control in adolescents and adults with persistent disease. Lack of US Food and Drug Administration approval, inconsistent insurance coverage, and limited options of ICS-formoterol combination available for use as SMART represent obstacles to wider integration of SMART in clinical practice.

Summary

SMART represents a paradigm shift in asthma management. By identifying and addressing the current and anticipated barriers to implementing SMART, its adoption by providers is likely to increase in the United States.

### Optimizing care for children with difficult-to-treat and severe asthma through specialist paediatric asthma centres: expert practical experience and advice [^116Fesf8]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Asthma is common in childhood, and most children achieve good symptom control with low-to-medium doses of inhaled corticosteroids. However, for some, symptoms remain problematic despite high treatment doses. Asthma can be described as 'difficult to treat' when it is uncontrolled despite medium- or high-dose inhaled corticosteroids with a second controller and/or with maintenance systemic corticosteroids; or when high-dose treatment is needed to control symptoms and reduce the risk of exacerbations. Difficult-to-treat asthma relates to modifiable factors such as poor adherence, incorrect inhaler technique, comorbidities or adverse exposures. After addressing modifiable factors, children whose disease remains poorly controlled on high doses of medication form a heterogeneous group considered to have 'severe' asthma phenotypes, and are eligible for step-up therapies. These include long-acting muscarinic antagonists, oral corticosteroids, and most recently, biologics targeting immunoglobulin (Ig)E, interleukin (IL)-4Rα, IL-5, and IL-13.

Severe asthma in children is a rare disease, accounting for less than 5% of all childhood asthma cases, yet it can cause frequent asthma attacks and hospital admissions, and its mortality is unacceptably high. Furthermore, although biologics have been available for managing asthma in adults and adolescents for almost two decades, research on their efficacy and safety in children has lagged. Accordingly, clinical experience in managing severe childhood asthma is limited, even among specialists.

This project convened paediatric pulmonologists and allergologists from northern Europe. Its initial aim was to give consensus-based practical advice on best practices to support clinical decision-making in two areas: first, considerations around biologic treatment for children aged 6–18 years with severe asthma; and second, on providing optimal care for these patients. We also considered how to disseminate these considerations throughout healthcare settings. As the project progressed, these objectives evolved with its emerging findings, and we refocused our aims on the considerations for selecting home or hospital delivery of biologics, as practical advice on this topic was found to be lacking.

This consensus is aimed at clinicians in specialist centres, as well as general paediatricians, paediatric allergologists and paediatric pulmonologists who refer children with the most severe asthma to specialist care. Consensus is based on expert opinion and is intended for use alongside published guidelines.

Implementation guidance

Clinician's Summary:

For individuals aged 12years and older with mild persistent asthma, the Expert Panel recommends either of the following two treatments as part of Step 2 therapy: a daily low-dose ICS and as-needed SABA for quick-relief therapy or intermittent as-needed SABA and an ICS used concomitantly (ie, one after the other) for worsening asthma. In this recommendation, "intermittent" ICS dosing is defined as the temporary use of an ICS in response to worsening asthma in an individual with asthma who is not taking ICS controller therapy regularly. This recommendation does not apply to ages 5 to 11 years because this therapy has not been adequately studied in this age group.

The Expert Panel makes the following suggestions for implementation of intermittent ICS dosing in individuals aged 12 years and older:
Individuals aged 12 years and older with mild persistent asthma who are not taking asthma treatment may benefit from this therapy. The Expert Panel has made no recommendation for children aged 0 to 4 years or 5 to 11 years with mild persistent asthma because of insufficient evidence.
Individuals aged 12 years and older with asthma and a low or high perception of symptoms may not be good candidates for as-needed ICS therapy. Regular low-dose ICS with SABA for quick-relief therapy may be preferred for such patients to avoid ICS undertreatment (low symptom perception) or overtreatment (high symptom perception).
Based on the regimen assessed in three of the four studies on intermittent ICS dosing, one approach to intermittent therapy is two to four puffs of albuterol followed by 80 to 250 μg of beclomethasone equivalent every 4 hours as needed for asthma symptoms. In these studies, the clinician determined the dosing a priori. Currently, these medications need to be administered sequentially in two separate inhalers, but combination inhalers with albuterol and an ICS may be available in the United States in the future.
Individuals who use this type of therapy can initiate intermittent therapy at home. However, they should receive regular follow-up to ensure that the intermittent regimen is still appropriate.
What clinicians should discuss with patients and families: Clinicians should inform individuals that the two treatment options do not have different effects on asthma control, asthma quality of life, or the frequency of asthma exacerbations when studied in large groups of people. Similarly, side effects are equally infrequent with daily and intermittent use. Shared decision making will allow the best choice to be made for a particular individual.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^116eivKt]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Severe asthma assessment and management in adults and adolescents — assess all patients with difficult-to-treat asthma to confirm the diagnosis of asthma, and to identify and manage factors that may be contributing to symptoms, poor quality of life, or exacerbations, and refer for expert advice at any stage, or if asthma does not improve in response to optimizing treatment. For patients with persistent symptoms and/or exacerbations despite high-dose ICS-LABA treatment (with good adherence and correct inhaler technique), the clinical or inflammatory phenotype should be assessed, as this may guide the selection of add-on treatment. Depending on the inflammatory phenotype and other clinical features, add-on treatments for severe asthma include long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMA), leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRAs), low-dose azithromycin (adults), and biologic agents for severe asthma, while low-dose maintenance oral corticosteroids (OCS) should be considered only as a last resort if no other options are available, because of their serious cumulative long-term side-effects. After initiating add-on therapy, assess the response to any add-on treatment, stop ineffective treatments, and consider other options; utilize specialist multidisciplinary team care for severe asthma, if available; continue to optimize patient care in collaboration with the primary care clinician and considering the patient's social and emotional needs; and invite patients with severe asthma to enroll in a registry or clinical trial, if available and relevant, to help fill evidence gaps.

### Effectiveness of drug treatment strategies to prevent asthma exacerbations and increase symptom-free days in asthmatic children: a network meta-analysis [^1134tmVj]. The Journal of Asthma (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the effectiveness and safety of current maintenance therapies that include inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), long-acting β-agonists (LABA) and/or leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRAs) in preventing exacerbations and improving symptoms in pediatric asthma.

Methods

A systematic review with network meta-analysis was conducted after a comprehensive search for relevant studies in the PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase and Clinical Trials databases, up to July 2014. Randomized clinical trials were selected comparing treatment strategies of the Global Initiative for Asthma guidelines. The full-text randomized clinical trials compared maintenance treatments for asthma in children (≤ 18 years) of ≥ 4 weeks duration, reporting exacerbations or symptom-free days. The primary and secondary effectiveness outcomes were the rates of moderate/severe exacerbations and symptom-free days from baseline, respectively. Withdrawal rates were taken as the safety outcome.

Results

Included in the network meta-analysis was 35 trials, comprising 12,010 patients. For both primary and secondary outcomes, combined ICS and LABA was ranked first in effectiveness (OR 0.70, 95% CI: 0.52–0.97 and OR 1.23, 95% CI: 0.94–1.61, respectively, compared with low-dose ICS), but the result of secondary outcomes was statistically insignificant. Low-dose ICS, medium- or high-dose ICS and combined ICS and LTRA strategies were comparable in effectiveness. ICS monotherapies, and ICS+LABA and ICS+LTRA strategies were similarly safe. High-dose ICS had the highest rate of total withdrawals, but the difference was not significant.

Conclusions

Combined ICS and LABA treatments were most effective in preventing exacerbations among pediatric asthma patients. Medium- or high-dose ICS, combined ICS and LTRAs, and low-dose ICS treatments seem to be equally effective.

Guidelines

Table 3 lists key recommendations from three international guidelines for the diagnosis and management of asthma in children. Overall, they are similar in their recommendations for the use of objectives measurements to confirm the diagnosis of asthma. The guidelines, however, differ in the age brackets used to classify management recommendations, which slightly limits comparisons. A key fundamental difference is that the recent GINA guideline does not recommend the use of SABA alone for the management of asthma in children and adolescents aged 6 years and above. For mild asthma (step 1 treatment), GINA advise using a combination of low dose ICS and formoterol inhaler as needed. In children aged 6–11 years, owing to device limitations, SABA as needed via a metered dose inhaler plus a dose of ICS at the same time is recommended as step 1 treatment. GINA further recommend that a combination of low dose ICS and formoterol inhaler is used as a reliever for children aged 12 years and over. The GINA recommendations are a major change to the management of mild asthma and reliever treatment in asthma.

Importance

Asthma is a major public health problem worldwide and is associated with excess morbidity, mortality, and economic costs associated with lost productivity. The National Asthma Education and Prevention Program has released the 2020 Asthma Guideline Update with updated evidence-based recommendations for treatment of patients with asthma.

Objective

To report updated recommendations for 6 topics for clinical management of adolescents and adults with asthma: (1) intermittent inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs); (2) add-on long-acting muscarinic antagonists; (3) fractional exhaled nitric oxide; (4) indoor allergen mitigation; (5) immunotherapy; and (6) bronchial thermoplasty.

Evidence Review

The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Advisory Council chose 6 topics to update the 2007 asthma guidelines based on results from a 2014 needs assessment. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality conducted systematic reviews of these 6 topics based on literature searches up to March-April 2017. Reviews were updated through October 2018 and used by an expert panel (n = 19) that included asthma content experts, primary care clinicians, dissemination and implementation experts, and health policy experts to develop 19 new recommendations using the GRADE method. The 17 recommendations for individuals aged 12 years or older are reported in this Special Communication.

Findings

From 20 572 identified references, 475 were included in the 6 systematic reviews to form the evidence basis for these recommendations. Compared with the 2007 guideline, there was no recommended change in step 1 (intermittent asthma) therapy (as-needed short-acting β2-agonists [SABAs] for rescue therapy). In step 2 (mild persistent asthma), either daily low-dose ICS plus as-needed SABA therapy or as-needed concomitant ICS and SABA therapy are recommended. Formoterol in combination with an ICS in a single inhaler (single maintenance and reliever therapy) is recommended as the preferred therapy for moderate persistent asthma in step 3 (low-dose ICS-formoterol therapy) and step 4 (medium-dose ICS-formoterol therapy) for both daily and as-needed therapy. A short-term increase in the ICS dose alone for worsening of asthma symptoms is not recommended. Add-on long-acting muscarinic antagonists are recommended in individuals whose asthma is not controlled by ICS-formoterol therapy for step 5 (moderate-severe persistent asthma). Fractional exhaled nitric oxide testing is recommended to assist in diagnosis and monitoring of symptoms, but not alone to diagnose or monitor asthma. Allergen mitigation is recommended only in individuals with exposure and relevant sensitivity or symptoms. When used, allergen mitigation should be allergen specific and include multiple allergen-specific mitigation strategies. Subcutaneous immunotherapy is recommended as an adjunct to standard pharmacotherapy for individuals with symptoms and sensitization to specific allergens. Sublingual immunotherapy is not recommended specifically for asthma. Bronchial thermoplasty is not recommended as part of standard care; if used, it should be part of an ongoing research effort.

Conclusions and Relevance

Asthma is a common disease with substantial human and economic costs globally. Although there is no cure or established means of prevention, effective treatment is available. Use of the recommendations in the 2020 Asthma Guideline Update should improve the health of individuals with asthma.

### Intermittent inhaled corticosteroid therapy versus placebo for persistent asthma in children and adults [^116dG2fF]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

International guidelines advocate using daily inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) in the management of children and adults with persistent asthma. However, in real world clinical settings, these medicines are often used at irregular intervals by patients. Recent evidence suggests that the use of intermittent ICS, with treatment initiated at the time of early symptoms, may still have benefits for reducing the severity of an asthma exacerbation.

Objectives

To compare the efficacy and safety of intermittent ICS versus placebo in the management of children and adults diagnosed with, or suspected to have, symptoms of mild persistent asthma.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register of trials (CAGR), the ClinicalTrials.gov website and the World Health Organization (WHO) trials portal in March 2015.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared intermittent ICS versus placebo in children and adults with symptoms of persistent asthma. No co-interventions were permitted other than rescue relievers and oral corticosteroids used during exacerbations.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion, methodological quality and extracted data. The primary efficacy outcome was the risk of asthma exacerbations requiring oral corticosteroids and the primary safety outcome was serious adverse health events. Secondary outcomes included exacerbations, lung function tests, asthma control, adverse effects, and withdrawal rates. Quality of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE criteria.

Main Results

Six trials (representing 490 preschool children, 145 school-aged children and 240 adults) met the inclusion criteria. Study durations were 12 to 52 weeks. Results for preschool children were presented in a separate analysis as this represents a distinct clinical condition, not necessarily related to the development of long term asthma. There was a reduction in the risk of patients experiencing one or more exacerbations requiring oral corticosteroids in older children (145 participants, odds ratio (OR) 0.57; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.29 to 1.12, low quality evidence) and adults with asthma (240 participants, OR 0.10; 95% CI 0.01 to 1.95, low quality evidence). These analyses were each based on the findings of a single study. No group difference was observed in the risk of serious adverse health events (385 participants; OR 1.00; 95% CI 0.14 to 7.25, moderate quality evidence). Compared to the placebo group, there was an insufficient number of participants to make firm conclusions whether the intermittent ICS group displayed any reduction in the rate of hospitalisations, day time and night time symptoms scores, or adverse events. Lung function tests reported by a single study favoured the use of ICS. There was no significant group difference in growth rate of children, or overall withdrawals. In preschool children with frequent wheezing episodes, the use of intermittent ICS at the onset of early symptoms reduced the likelihood of requiring rescue oral corticosteroids by half (490 participants; OR: 0.48; 95% CI 0.31 to 0.73, moderate quality evidence with minimal heterogeneity). Intermittent therapy was associated with fewer serious adverse events (439 participants; OR 0.42; 95% CI 0.17 to 1.02, low quality evidence). There was no significant difference in hospitalisations or in a single study measuring parent perceived quality of life. However, intermittent therapy was associated with improvements in both day time and night time symptoms. There was no increase in the rates of withdrawals, and overall and treatment-specific adverse events.

Authors' Conclusions

In children and adults with mild persistent asthma, two studies have shown that the use of intermittent ICS at the time of exacerbation reduced the chances of needing oral corticosteroids by half. This result is statistically significant if we assume that the effect size is the same for each study population (fixed effects model), but is not statistically significant when using a random effects model. However, the paucity of published evidence limits our conclusions towards the 'as-needed' use of this medication. The small number of studies and participants were the major reasons for downgrading the overall quality of the findings. A corresponding result was found in preschool children with wheeze. In this age group, an improvement in day time and night time asthma symptoms score and parental perceived quality of life of children similarly favoured the ICS group. However, there was no statistical difference in hospitalisation rates in any group. This treatment was not associated with any significant increase in adverse events. There was no growth suppression noted with the use of intermittent ICS in either preschool or school-aged children. Considering the limited number of available studies, we emphasise the need for more randomised controlled studies in order to confirm these findings.

Future research opportunities

The Expert Panel offers the following suggestions for future research:
Comparative effectiveness studies of LAMA therapy for asthma. Because the majority of LAMA studies were efficacy studies, the clinical impact of LAMA treatment in real-world settings is not well understood.
Comparative effectiveness and safety of ICS plus LAMA versus ICS-LABA in ethnically diverse population in studies that are adequately powered to examine the harms and benefits of these two treatment options.
Systematic reviews in children with asthma aged 6 to 11 years to inform future guidelines.
Comparisons of a LAMA to a leukotriene inhibitor as add-on therapy to ICS-LABA in individuals with uncontrolled persistent asthma.
Role of LAMAs other than tiotropium as add-on therapy to ICS therapy in individuals aged 12 years and older with uncontrolled persistent asthma.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^116aZEEc]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Initial asthma treatment in children 6–11 years provides preferred initial treatment by presenting symptoms, and states that these recommendations are based on evidence and consensus. Infrequent asthma symptoms (e.g., 1–2 days/week or less): Low-dose ICS taken whenever SABA is taken (Evidence B) in combination or in separate inhalers. Asthma symptoms 2–5 days/week: Low-dose ICS plus as-needed SABA (Evidence A); other options include taking ICS whenever SABA is taken in combination or separate inhalers (Evidence B), or daily LTRA (Evidence A for less effectiveness for exacerbations than ICS), and to consider likely adherence if the reliever is SABA. Asthma symptoms most days (e.g., 4–5 days/week) or waking due to asthma once a week or more: Low-dose ICS-LABA plus as needed SABA (Evidence A), OR Medium-dose ICS plus as-needed SABA (Evidence A), OR Very-low-dose ICS-formoterol maintenance-and-reliever (Evidence B); other options include daily low-dose ICS and LTRA, plus as-needed SABA. Daily asthma symptoms, waking at night once or more a week, and low lung function: Medium-dose ICS-LABA plus as-needed SABA, OR low-dose ICS-formoterol maintenance-and-reliever (MART). Initial asthma presentation during an acute exacerbation: Treat as for exacerbation, including a short course of OCS if the exacerbation is severe; commence Step 3 or Step 4 treatment, and arrange follow-up.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the primary care management of asthma [^113QXmMk]. DoD/VA (2025). High credibility.

VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline — For patients with asthma (ages 12 and over) not controlled by medium or high dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and long-acting beta agonists (LABA), we suggest adding a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) (Weak for | Reviewed, New-added). Evidence from a Cochrane literature review suggested the addition of a LAMA improved control in patients, ages 12 and over, with an evidence base of 5 SRs and 3 RCTs including patients whose asthma was uncontrolled or only partly controlled despite treatment with ICS prior to study initiation. Across 17,000 patients in 17 RCTs, most of the studies showed statistical significance for triple therapy and addition of a LAMA was associated with improvement and reduction in symptoms and decreased exacerbations. Triple-therapy combinations (ICS medium or high-dose/LABA/LAMA) reduced moderate-to-severe asthma exacerbations compared to dual therapy (ICS medium or high-dose/LABA), although severe asthma exacerbations requiring hospitalization did not differ significantly, and in 5 RCTs the ICS-high dose/LABA/LAMA increased the number of ACQ responders at the 12 months follow-up significantly; there was reduction of severe exacerbations and Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) (critical values), however there was no appreciable difference in the Asthma Quality of Life Quotient (AQLQ) score. The Work Group's confidence in the quality of the evidence was low, the evidence favored triple therapy but no clinically meaningful difference for AQLQ scores at 12 months, and the body of evidence had limitations including length of study (less than 12 months) and few pediatric patients.

Regarding medical management for severe asthma phenotypes, more specifically with respect to omalizumab, CTS 2017 guidelines recommend to consider offering omalizumab in pediatric and adolescent patients having repeated exacerbations or poor control when therapy is stepped down from high-dose to moderate-dose ICSs and at least one other controller, given the known risk of side effects associated with high-dose ICSs in pediatric patients.

### Questions in mild asthma: an official American Thoracic Society research statement [^1151a5X8]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Mild asthma management in children and adolescents — In preschool-aged children with intermittent wheezing at high risk to develop asthma, daily ICS and intermittent high-dose ICS were associated with decreased symptoms and exacerbations. In preschool-aged children with mild persistent asthma with markers of T2 inflammation such as aeroallergen sensitization or a blood eosinophil count of > 300 cells/μl, a differential response favored daily ICS compared with LTRAs or ICS taken whenever albuterol was used for symptoms. In adolescents aged 12–17 years with mild asthma, as-needed budesonide–formoterol was superior to as-needed terbutaline for severe exacerbation reduction, with similar efficacy to budesonide maintenance. The text notes that adherence to controller medication is key to asthma control and that an as-needed controller approach may improve adherence when it is most needed, during a period of increased symptoms. A recent meta-analysis of nonpharmacological approaches for children and adults found that patient education programs, multifaceted interventions, renovating homes to reduce environmental exposures, and air filtration systems significantly improved asthma control, and the psychosocial environment is recognized as a significant contributor to asthma morbidity.

### Management of asthma in children… [^111zjRmt]. AAFP (2001). Low credibility.

26 Oral corticosteroids have broad anti-inflammatory effects and may be used in a limited, short course to gain initial control of the asthma and speed resolution of moderate-persistent or severe-persistent exacerbations. 26 The anticholinergic drug ipratropium is not approved by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of asthma in children 12 years or younger. However, it has been prescribed for off-label use in children with asthma and may be helpful in those rare children who do not tolerate inhaled beta. 26 They are not a substitute for anti-inflammatory medications and should not be used to treat patients with acute symptoms or exacerbations. The FDA approved a long-acting beta 2 agonist, salmeterol, for treatment of asthma in children 12 years and older. It may provide 24-hour bronchodilation with twice-daily dosing and may reduce nocturnal asthma symptoms and prevent exercise-induced bronchospasm.

Theophylline produces mild-to-moderate bronchodilation and may be used as add-on therapy with anti-inflammatory medications. 26 However, theophylline has a narrow therapeutic index, variable clearance rates, drug interactions and serious side effects; therefore, monitoring of blood levels is required. Theophylline is reserved for the treatment of patients with severe asthma, when polypharmacy is necessary. Cromolyn sodium and nedocromil are first-line, daily anti-inflammatory inhaled agents that inhibit early- and late-phase bronchoconstriction, with virtually no serious side effects and no known drug interactions. 26 These medications are available in MDI and nebulizer formulations; however, frequent administration is required, which may discourage compliance. 24 Furthermore, these agents are less effective than corticosteroids in many patients. Nedocromil's bitter taste may discourage compliance in some children.

Antileukotriene agents were developed to inhibit the effects of leukotrienes. This class of drugs represents the first new approach to asthma therapy in 25 years. The leukotriene receptor antagonists montelukast and zafirlukast, and the 5-lipoxyge-nase inhibitor zileuton are unique in their ability to target specific components of asthmatic inflammation.

### Asthma and other wheezing disorders in children… [^1168az5V]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

2 agonist alone, multiple doses of inhaled ipratropium bromide plus an inhaled beta 2 agonist reduced hospital admissions and improved lung function in children 18 months to 17 years of age with severe asthma exacerbations. In children with mild to moderate asthma exacerbations, a single dose of inhaled ipratropium bromide plus a beta 2 agonist improved lung function for up to two hours but did not reduce hospital admissions compared with a beta 2 agonist alone. One RCT including children with moderate to severe asthma showed that oral prednisolone reduced hospital admissions and improved lung function at four hours compared with inhaled fluticasone. A subsequent RCT including children four to 16 years of age showed that nebulized fluticasone improved lung function over seven days compared with oral prednisolone.

One RCT including children five to 16 years of age hospitalized with severe asthma showed no significant difference between nebulized budesonide and oral prednisolone in lung function after 24 hours or 24 days of hospitalization. RCTs in children five to 16 years of age have shown that inhaled corticosteroids were more effective than an inhaled long-acting beta 2 agonist or inhaled nedocromil at improving symptoms and lung function in children with asthma. Inhaled Nedocromil Two RCTs including children six to 12 years of age taking usual medication showed that adding inhaled nedocromil reduced asthma symptom scores, asthma severity, and bronchodilator use and improved lung function compared with placebo.

One large RCT including children five to 12 years of age with mild to moderate asthma showed no significant difference in lung function, hospital admission rates, or symptom scores between adding nedocromil and adding budesonide or placebo, but it showed that budesonide was superior to nedocromil and that nedocromil was superior to placebo in several measures of asthma symptoms and morbidity. Adding Long-Acting Beta2 Agonists One RCT including children six to 16 years of age showed that adding inhaled salmeterol (a long-acting beta.
