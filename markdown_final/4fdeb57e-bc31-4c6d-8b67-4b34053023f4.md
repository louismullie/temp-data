## Question

treatment for rash of renal failure

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about treatment for the "rash of renal failure", focusing on pruritus and other cutaneous manifestations in CKD/ESRD. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying the phenotype of the rash or itch and ruling out dangerous mimics. Then, I should verify whether the renal and mineral-bone milieu is optimized and whether dialysis adequacy has been addressed. Next, I will consider topical therapy, followed by phototherapy, and then evidence-based systemic options with renal dosing. After that, I need to ensure monitoring with patient-reported outcomes and tailor choices to special populations. Finally, I will define red flags that warrant urgent escalation or biopsy, and I should double-check where guideline recommendations and regulatory approvals directly support each step.

> Let me first confirm what "rash of renal failure" most often represents. In CKD/ESRD, the predominant presentation is uremic pruritus, frequently with xerosis, nocturnal worsening, and excoriations without primary inflammatory lesions; other common entities include acquired perforating dermatoses, nail changes, and pigmentary alterations, so I need to examine the entire skin, scalp, and nails and document distribution and timing relative to dialysis sessions [^113u9Qyr] [^1119UTQW].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — I should actively rule out dangerous mimics or comorbid processes. Painful retiform purpura or necrotic plaques should prompt concern for calciphylaxis; digital ischemic changes around an AV fistula with nonhealing lesions can signal dialysis-associated steal syndrome; and severe drug eruptions such as SJS/TEN or DRESS can present with rash and contribute to AKI, requiring prompt drug withdrawal and supportive care; I should scrutinize recent medication changes and systemic symptoms carefully [^116zyXCp] [^115pDakf] [^112CMeyv] [^113dywio] [^1124qrEU].

> Next, I should review the renal and metabolic milieu. Wait, let me verify the fundamentals first: ensure dialysis adequacy, correct calcium-phosphate balance, control PTH to accepted targets, address anemia, and institute regular emollients before escalating therapy; for truly intractable pruritus despite optimization, KDIGO 2024 notes this can be an indication to initiate or intensify dialysis strategies, which I need to keep in mind if symptoms remain refractory [^111LkijD] [^114STYkA].

> I will now examine topical strategies. Emollients are foundational for xerosis-driven itch; heparinoid-based moisturizers have supportive randomized data in dialysis patients, and I should confirm consistent twice-daily application on dry and itchy sites. If pruritus localizes, I can consider capsaicin cream or topical calcipotriol as per BAD guidance, while reminding myself that a randomized trial did not find tacrolimus 0.1% ointment superior to vehicle for dialysis pruritus, so I should not rely on it. Emerging but lower-certainty options include sericin-containing topicals, which some guidelines list as consider options, though I need to set expectations about evidence quality [^112ExY54] [^111NQCMd] [^114NN2W6] [^117UetVq].

> Let me consider phototherapy next. The British Association of Dermatologists recommends broadband UVB for uremic pruritus, and in practice I should coordinate scheduling around dialysis to maximize adherence and monitor for photosensitivity and xerosis, recognizing that some patients will need maintenance phototherapy to sustain benefit [^114fxNKE].

> For systemic therapy, I should confirm renal dosing and start low. Gabapentin has randomized evidence for CKD-associated pruritus and is guideline-recommended; in hemodialysis, I should dose after dialysis, typically 100–300 mg post-HD, and titrate by response while watching for sedation and dizziness. Pregabalin is an alternative recommended in European S2k guidance; however, I must adjust for creatinine clearance, including supplemental post-dialysis dosing per FDA labeling, and in older adults I should start even lower and go slower to avoid adverse effects [^1136qDj8] [^1148gazg] [^111nj8kz] [^111XYgM7] [^113JqW13].

> Hmm, wait a minute — am I defaulting to antihistamines? I should double-check guidance. The BAD guideline advises against long-term sedating antihistamines for uremic pruritus due to cognitive risks, so I should avoid making them a chronic strategy except in palliative contexts. If pruritus is opioid-induced rather than uremic, alternative agents such as mirtazapine or ondansetron can be considered, but that is a different mechanism and should not distract from CKD-aP management [^117FwP8g] [^114b6Afb].

> Now, let me verify the role of opioid-system modulation specific to CKD-aP. Difelikefalin (IV κ-opioid receptor agonist) is FDA-approved for hemodialysis patients with moderate-to-severe pruritus; the pivotal trials dosed 0.5 mcg/kg IV into the HD circuit after each session with clinically meaningful reductions in itch intensity and sleep disturbance, so in persistent HD-related pruritus despite first-line measures, this is an evidence-based option I should discuss with the patient and dialysis team [^117TcXGC].

> I need to ensure we are measuring what matters to patients. Let me first confirm a baseline itch severity and sleep impact with validated PROs such as daily WI-NRS, noting it was the anchor in difelikefalin trials, and consider broader HRQoL tools; integrating PROs into routine CKD care helps me track response and decide when to escalate or de-escalate therapy [^117TcXGC] [^116bwAh9].

> But wait, what if symptoms persist despite these steps? I should review adherence, reconfirm dialysis adequacy and mineral balance, reconsider a trial of NB/BB-UVB, and reassess systemic options or combinations, while also re-evaluating for alternative diagnoses like acquired perforating dermatoses or neuropathic drivers that might respond better to gabapentinoids or antidepressants; if pruritus remains intractable and debilitating, I should re-check KDIGO criteria for dialysis strategy adjustments and discuss multidisciplinary options including transplant candidacy when appropriate [^1119UTQW] [^1153PTJf] [^114STYkA].

> Special situations require extra caution. In older adults, I should double-check fall risk with gabapentinoids and use conservative dosing; in dialysis-unit reactions with acute pruritus, I need to consider hypersensitivity to dialyzer components and manage per acute HD reaction protocols; in transplant recipients or oncology patients, I must keep drug-induced rashes and immune-related events on the differential and coordinate with the treating teams to adjust immunosuppression or culprit agents as indicated [^113JqW13] [^112yXeuB] [^111Acexy] [^111dZg7h].

> Finally, I should summarize the flow I will follow and verify no steps are missing: define the phenotype and exclude emergencies; optimize dialysis and CKD-MBD parameters with emollients; layer in targeted topicals; add phototherapy if needed; use renally dosed gabapentin or pregabalin as first-line systemic therapy; escalate to difelikefalin for persistent HD-related itch; track with PROs; and keep re-checking for alternative diagnoses or drug eruptions — correcting course if new information emerges. If I realize I presumed topical tacrolimus might help, I need to correct myself, because randomized data do not support its efficacy in HD pruritus, so it should not displace higher-quality options in this pathway [^111LkijD] [^112ExY54] [^114fxNKE] [^111nj8kz] [^111XYgM7] [^117TcXGC] [^114NN2W6].

The rash of renal failure is most often **uremic pruritus** [^113u9Qyr] and **calciphylaxis**, requiring a stepwise approach: optimize dialysis, correct calcium-phosphate-PTH, and use emollients for xerosis [^111LkijD]. For pruritus, first-line options are **gabapentin or pregabalin** [^1148gazg] with renal dosing [^111XYgM7], and difelikefalin for hemodialysis patients [^117TcXGC]; BB-UVB phototherapy is an alternative [^114fxNKE]. Calciphylaxis needs **urgent sodium thiosulfate** [^116zyXCp], wound care, and multidisciplinary management. Avoid sedating antihistamines long term [^117FwP8g] and use topical steroids only for short courses. Persistent or severe rashes should prompt dermatology referral and biopsy to exclude vasculitis, drug reactions, or malignancy [^1119UTQW].

## Common rashes in renal failure

- **Uremic pruritus (UP)**: Generalized itch with xerosis, excoriations, and lichenification; common in CKD/ESRD [^113u9Qyr].

- **Calciphylaxis**: Painful violaceous plaques/nodules with necrosis, linked to calcium-phosphate imbalance and high mortality [^116zyXCp].

- **Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF)**: Indurated plaques with woody fibrosis, associated with gadolinium exposure in advanced CKD [^113u9Qyr].

- **Acquired perforating dermatosis**: Hyperkeratotic papules with central keratotic plugs [^113u9Qyr], often in diabetes and dialysis [^1119UTQW].

- **Drug-induced rashes**: Maculopapular, urticarial, or severe reactions (SJS/TEN, DRESS) [^112CMeyv] from medications (e.g. allopurinol, antibiotics, anticonvulsants) [^113dywio] [^115bk5Rs].

---

## General principles of management

- **Optimize dialysis**: Ensure adequate dialysis [^111LkijD] to reduce uremic toxins and pruritus.

- **Correct metabolic abnormalities**: Normalize calcium-phosphate balance [^116zyXCp], control PTH [^111LkijD], and correct anemia with erythropoietin.

- **Identify and discontinue offending drugs**: Stop suspected agents promptly [^113Ji8YC].

- **Maintain skin hydration**: Use emollients [^112ExY54] regularly for xerosis and pruritus.

## Specific treatments for uremic pruritus

| **Treatment** | **Mechanism** | **Efficacy** | **Considerations** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Gabapentin | GABAergic modulation | Effective; first-line | Renal dosing; sedation [^1148gazg] [^1136qDj8] [^111nj8kz] |
| Pregabalin | GABAergic modulation | Effective; first-line | Renal dosing; sedation [^1148gazg] [^111XYgM7] |
| Difelikefalin | Kappa-opioid agonist | Effective in HD | IV post-dialysis; nausea, dizziness [^117TcXGC] |
| BB-UVB phototherapy | Anti-inflammatory | Effective alternative | 2–3×/week; skin cancer risk [^114fxNKE] |
| Topical capsaicin | TRPV1 desensitization | Moderate benefit | Burning sensation [^111NQCMd] |
| Sericin cream | Anti-inflammatory | Moderate benefit | Well tolerated [^114wfLva] |

---

## Management of calciphylaxis

- **Sodium thiosulfate**: IV 25 g thrice weekly post-dialysis; reduces calcification and pain [^116zyXCp].

- **Wound care**: Debridement, dressings, and infection control [^116zyXCp].

- **Multidisciplinary approach**: Nephrology, dermatology, surgery, and pain management [^113u9Qyr].

---

## Management of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis

Avoid **gadolinium**, especially in advanced CKD. Physical therapy helps maintain mobility and function. Evidence for experimental therapies is limited; options include immunosuppressants and phototherapy [^113u9Qyr].

---

## Management of drug-induced rashes

Immediately discontinue the **offending drug** [^113Ji8YC]. For severe reactions (e.g. DRESS, AIN), systemic corticosteroids may be required [^1124qrEU]. Provide supportive care with antihistamines, emollients, and wound care.

---

## Preventive measures

Perform **regular skin assessments** [^1119UTQW] to enable early detection and management. Educate patients on skin care, hydration, and avoidance of irritants. Monitor medications, adjust doses, and watch for adverse reactions.

---

## Indications for dermatology referral

Refer for a **severe or persistent rash** unresponsive to initial therapy. Suspected vasculitis or autoimmune disease warrants biopsy and specialist input [^1119UTQW]. Suspected malignancy requires biopsy and oncologic evaluation.

---

## Prognosis and complications

Uremic pruritus is **chronic and relapsing** [^1153PTJf] but often improves with dialysis and symptom control. Calciphylaxis carries **high mortality** [^116zyXCp]; early, aggressive treatment improves outcomes. Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis is progressive, making prevention key [^111pTyuM]. Drug-induced rashes generally resolve after drug cessation, though severe reactions may cause permanent damage [^112CMeyv].

---

Effective management of renal failure–associated rashes centers on **optimizing dialysis**, correcting metabolic derangements [^111LkijD], and targeted therapies for pruritus and calciphylaxis, with early dermatology input for severe or atypical cases.

The efficacy of Korsuva was evaluated in two randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials (Trial 1 [NCT03422653] and Trial 2 [NCT03636269]) that enrolled a total of 851 subjects aged 18 years and older undergoing hemodialysis (HD) who had moderate-to-severe pruritus.

In both trials, subjects received intravenous bolus injections of Korsuva 0.5 mcg per kilogram of dry body weight into the venous line of the hemodialysis circuit at the end of each hemodialysis session, or placebo, three times per week for 12 weeks. A 7-day run-in period prior to randomization was used to confirm that each subject had moderate-to-severe pruritus and to establish a baseline itch intensity, as measured by the patient-reported daily 24-hour Worst Itching Intensity Numerical Rating Scale (WI-NRS) scores, ranging from 0 ("no itch") to 10 ("worst itch imaginable").

- **Baseline characteristics in Trial 1**: The mean (SD) baseline WI-NRS score was 7.1 (1.5). At baseline, 61% of subjects were male, 49% were White, 42% were Black or African American, the mean age was 57 years (range 22 to 88 years), and 40% of subjects were using prior anti-pruritic medications, including sedating antihistamines, and continued their use throughout the trial.

- **Baseline characteristics in Trial 2**: The mean (SD) baseline WI-NRS score was 7.2 (1.4). At baseline, 58% of subjects were male, 70% were White, 19% were Black or African American, the mean age was 60 years (range 23 to 90 years), and 36% of subjects were using prior anti-pruritic medications, including sedating antihistamines, and continued their use throughout the trial.

In each trial, efficacy was assessed based on the above parameters.

### Calciphylaxis: Risk factors, diagnosis, and treatment [^116zyXCp]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Calciphylaxis is a rare but devastating condition that has continued to challenge the medical community since its early descriptions in the scientific literature many decades ago. It is predominantly seen in patients with chronic kidney failure treated with dialysis (uremic calciphylaxis) but is also described in patients with earlier stages of chronic kidney disease and with normal kidney function.

In this review, we discuss the available medical literature regarding risk factors, diagnosis, and treatment of both uremic and nonuremic calciphylaxis. High-quality evidence for the evaluation and management of calciphylaxis is lacking at this time due to its rare incidence and poorly understood pathogenesis and the relative paucity of collaborative research efforts. We hereby provide a summary of recommendations developed by a multidisciplinary team for patients with calciphylaxis.

### Acute kidney injury: A guide to diagnosis and management [^117E4SRg]. American Family Physician (2012). Low credibility.

Acute kidney injury is characterized by an abrupt deterioration in kidney function, manifested by an increase in serum creatinine level, with or without reduced urine output. The spectrum of injury ranges from mild to advanced, sometimes requiring renal replacement therapy. Diagnostic evaluation can classify acute kidney injury as prerenal, intrinsic renal, or postrenal.

The initial workup includes a patient history to identify the use of nephrotoxic medications or systemic illnesses that might cause poor renal perfusion or directly impair renal function. A physical examination should assess intravascular volume status and identify skin rashes indicative of systemic illness. The initial laboratory evaluation should include measurement of serum creatinine level, complete blood count, urinalysis, and fractional excretion of sodium. Ultrasonography of the kidneys should be performed in most patients, particularly in older men, to rule out obstruction.

Management of acute kidney injury involves fluid resuscitation, avoidance of nephrotoxic medications and contrast media exposure, and correction of electrolyte imbalances. Renal replacement therapy (dialysis) is indicated for refractory hyperkalemia, volume overload, intractable acidosis, uremic encephalopathy, pericarditis, or pleuritis, and removal of certain toxins. Recognition of risk factors, such as older age, sepsis, hypovolemia/shock, cardiac surgery, infusion of contrast agents, diabetes mellitus, preexisting chronic kidney disease, cardiac failure, and liver failure, is important. Team-based approaches for prevention and management are also emphasized.

### Acute renal failure and its risk factors in Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis [^112CMeyv]. American Journal of Nephrology (2009). Low credibility.

Skin lesions are the most frequent manifestation of adverse drug reactions. Drug-induced cutaneous hypersensitivity and drug-induced acute interstitial nephritis might share a similar mechanism involving drug-specific T cells. We investigated the renal outcomes of Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), the most severe forms of drug-induced cutaneous hypersensitivity, and hypothesize that skin detachment in SJS/TEN might be associated with acute renal failure (ARF).

- **Methods**: 234 hospitalized patients were retrospectively classified into an SJS/TEN group (skin detachment) or an erythematous multiforme majus group (target-like exanthema alone).

- **Results**: Both drugs and chronic kidney disease (CKD) are associated with SJS/TEN. The SJS/TEN group was more likely to develop ARF than the erythematous multiforme majus group (18.8% vs. 4.3%, p < 0.05) despite similar initial creatinine clearance. In the ARF patients, RIFLE-F class, dialysis, and long-term dialysis were 25%, 15%, and 5%, respectively. The offending drugs in ARF were also associated with CKD. Hyponatremia and late hypokalemia were more frequent in the SJS/TEN group (15.6% vs. 2.9%, 7.3% vs. 0.7%, respectively, p < 0.05). Sepsis, allopurinol, antibiotics, NSAIDs, CKD, and hypoalbuminemia (odds ratios: 18.8, 9.8, 10.1, 9.0, 5.3, and 3.3, respectively, p < 0.05) were identified as risk factors for developing ARF.

- **Conclusion**: ARF, the need for dialysis, and late hypokalemia could be consequences of SJS/TEN. Skin detachment after certain medications might implicate associated ARF, especially in CKD patients.

### The 2024 British Society for Rheumatology guideline for management of systemic sclerosis-executive summary [^112pGcd9]. Rheumatology (2024). High credibility.

- **Renal complications**: What is the best management for SRC?

The most serious renal complication of SSc is SRC with thrombotic microangiopathy with acute kidney injury in the context of SSc, generally associated with significant new-onset hypertension.

- **Recommendation for treatment of SRC**: Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor should be initiated or continued in all cases of diagnosed SRC and up-titrated to the maximum therapeutic dose (1A, 100%). Other antihypertensive drugs are often required to control hypertension and can be added based on clinical need (1B, 99%). In adults, glucocorticoid treatment should be minimized in SSc due to association with increased SRC (1A, 96%). When required, renal replacement therapy should initially use the least haemodynamically demanding approach (e.g. haemofiltration or peritoneal dialysis) (1C, 99%). Renal biopsy should be considered when diagnosis is uncertain (especially if substantial proteinuria, ANCA+, overlap serology SLE, etc) (1C, 99%). Referral for renal transplantation may be considered after 12 months in cases without features suggesting significant renal recovery (1B, 99%).

- **Skin complications**: What is the best management for non-fibrotic skin manifestations in SSc?

As well as skin thickening and fibrosis, there are many other dermatological aspects of SSc, and these require expert management.

- **Recommendation for non-fibrotic skin manifestations in SSc**: Practical approaches, maintaining adequately moisturized skin, are essential. It is strongly recommended to avoid frequent bathing with harsh deodorant soaps, and emollients should be used regularly.

### Sericin cream reduces pruritus in hemodialysis patients: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled experimental study [^114xXoE3]. BMC Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

Pruritus associated with chronic kidney disease has been linked to elevated levels of C-reactive protein and other inflammatory cytokines. This evidence suggests an inflammatory component in this form of pruritus. Some authors consider uremic pruritus (UP) to be a skin manifestation of chronic inflammation. Recently, the "persistent microinflammation" theory, which suggests that inflammation may be related to the genesis of UP, was proposed. The skin of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients with UP contains an increased number of mast cells, and these cells can release various substances such as histamine, interleukins (IL), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF).

Pruritic skin can appear normal except for dryness; as the severity of pruritus is closely correlated with skin dryness, xerosis treatment typically begins with a topical agent such as a gentle moisturizing cream. Because sericin is well known for its moisturizing effect and its ability to reduce the generation of pro-inflammatory cytokines by fibroblasts, this study assessed the usefulness of sericin cream in treating UP. Evaluating the degree of pruritus was challenging due to its subjective nature; therefore, functional measurements of skin conditions associated with pruritus, such as skin hydration and skin irritation, were used as objective indices. We found that both sericin cream and the cream base used to prepare the sericin cream increased the moisture content of the stratum corneum. However, the level of hydration was significantly higher in the skin treated with sericin cream.

### KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease [^114STYkA]. Kidney International (2024). High credibility.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for chronic kidney disease, specifically with respect to renal replacement therapy (RRT), the KDIGO 2024 guidelines recommend initiating dialysis in the presence of one or more of the following conditions, often occurring in the glomerular filtration rate range of 5–10 mL/min/1.73 m²:

- **Symptoms or signs attributable to kidney failure**: This includes neurological signs and symptoms attributable to uremia, pericarditis, anorexia, medically resistant acid-based or electrolyte abnormalities, intractable pruritus, serositis, and acid-base or electrolyte abnormalities.

- **Inability to control volume status or blood pressure (BP)**: This indicates a need for intervention when fluid volume or BP cannot be adequately managed.

- **Progressive deterioration in nutritional status**: This is particularly relevant when the condition is refractory to dietary intervention or is accompanied by cognitive impairment.

### Dengue fever in renal transplant patients: A systematic review of literature [^111f1n5K]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Dengue is the most rapidly spreading mosquito-borne viral disease in the world. Over the last 50 years, its incidence has increased 30-fold, spreading to new countries and transitioning from urban to rural settings. An estimated 50 million dengue infections occur annually, and approximately 2.5 billion people live in dengue-endemic countries. The illness ranges from being asymptomatic or presenting as a mild, flu-like illness (dengue fever, DF) associated with a rash, to a more severe form with plasma leakage, hemorrhage (dengue hemorrhagic fever – DHF), shock, and multi-organ failure (dengue shock syndrome-DSS). Liver failure, cardiac, neurological, or hematological complications may occur as atypical complications, known as extended dengue syndrome.

With advancements in immunosuppression, renal transplant has become the management of choice for end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Some transplant recipients reside in hyper-endemic and endemic areas for dengue and are at increased risk of developing the disease. The affected countries are also notable tourist destinations, posing a risk to traveling transplant recipients. Although dengue is typically described as a mild disease in renal transplant patients, severe morbidity, such as graft failure necessitating dialysis and graft nephrectomy, as well as mortality, has been reported. This paper reviews the demographic, clinicopathological, and immunosuppression profiles of renal transplant patients with confirmed dengue infection.

### Diagnosis and management of acute interstitial nephritis [^113Ji8YC]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Acute interstitial nephritis is an important cause of acute renal failure resulting from immune-mediated tubulointerstitial injury, initiated by medications, infection, and other causes. Acute interstitial nephritis may be implicated in up to 15 percent of patients hospitalized for acute renal failure. Clinical features are essentially those of acute renal failure from any cause, and apart from a history of new illness or medication exposure, there are no specific history, physical examination, or laboratory findings that distinguish acute interstitial nephritis from other causes of acute renal failure. Classic findings of fever, rash, and arthralgias may be absent in up to two thirds of patients. Diagnostic studies such as urine eosinophils and renal gallium 67 scanning provide suggestive evidence, but they are unable to reliably confirm or exclude the diagnosis of acute interstitial nephritis. Renal biopsy remains the gold standard for diagnosis, but it may not be required in mild cases or when clinical improvement is rapid after removal of an offending agent or medication. The time until removal of such agents, and renal biopsy findings, provide the best prognostic information for return to baseline renal function. Corticosteroids appear to provide some benefit in terms of clinical improvement and return of renal function, but no controlled clinical trials have been conducted to confirm this.

### Recent advances in the treatment of uremic pruritus [^113B7zby]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2020). Low credibility.

This article provides a focused update on uremic pruritus, highlighting the latest evidence concerning its epidemiology, pathophysiology, and treatment options for this common and bothersome condition. Half of dialysis patients and a quarter of those with non-dialysis chronic kidney disease experience bothersome itch that reduces quality of life and is increasingly recognized to be associated with poor outcomes, including mortality.

The KALM-1 trial reported effective symptomatic relief with difelikefalin, bolstering support for the role of an imbalance of μ and κ-opioid receptor activity in pruritogenesis. The role of a chronic inflammatory state, increased cytokine levels, and altered immune signaling in pruritogenic nerve activation continues to be elucidated with basic science, paving the way for future novel therapeutics. In the meantime, gabapentin appears to be the most evidence-based widely available uremic pruritus treatment, as long as care is taken with dosing and monitoring of side effects.

Uremic pruritus remains a top research priority. Patients with uremic pruritus may be able to look forward to a new decade of understanding, knowledge, and novel treatment options for this burdensome condition. As difelikefalin and other potential agents come to market, cost-effectiveness assessments of these interventions will help determine if the widespread use of them is feasible amongst renal programs.

### Unexpected recovery from longterm renal failure in severe diffuse proliferative lupus nephritis [^116SoqDK]. BMC Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

A 12-year-old Caucasian girl presented at her general practitioner because of swollen legs and a spotted skin macular rash over her face, arms, and chest. She was also complaining about headaches, abdominal pain, arthralgia, and macroscopic haematuria. In the last few weeks, she had gained 4 kg in body weight. Upon admission to the children's hospital, she was in a poor general state with hypertension of 143/99 mmHg, considerable oedema of the legs, and a facial rash.

Laboratory results showed anemia (hemoglobin 9.2 g/dl), leukopenia (2,650/μl), normal thrombocyte counts, acute renal failure (creatinine 5.8 mg/dl, urea 166 mg/dl) with hyperkalemia (6.4 mmol/l), and metabolic acidosis. Furthermore, macroscopic haematuria with dysmorphic erythrocytes, proteinuria of 6.6 g/m² body surface area per day, serum albumin of 19.6 g/l, and oliguria were observed. An abdominal ultrasound demonstrated ascites but no pleural or pericardial effusion, enlarged kidneys with increased echogenicity, and a lack of corticomedullary differentiation.

### Lack of efficacy of tacrolimus ointment 0.1% for treatment of hemodialysis-related pruritus: a randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled study [^114NN2W6]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

Pruritus is a common and disabling symptom for patients undergoing hemodialysis. Many topical and systemic treatments have been used for uremic pruritus, mostly in anecdotal reports. A recent case series demonstrated that topical tacrolimus ointment 0.03% had a significant antipruritic effect for patients with uremia. In an attempt to confirm these findings, we conducted a randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled study to assess the efficacy of tacrolimus ointment 0.1% for the treatment of hemodialysis-related pruritus. The results of this study do not demonstrate that tacrolimus ointment 0.1% is more effective than vehicle in relieving uremic pruritus.

### Management of toxicity to isoform α-specific PI3K inhibitors [^114AJAnr]. Annals of Oncology (2019). Low credibility.

Other measures to be considered for a symptomatic rash that does not improve with the above treatments include the following:

- **Topical antibiotics**: If there is evidence of superinfection or acneiform rash, consider clindamycin 1%–2%, erythromycin 1%–2% (either gel or solution formulations can be used, but ointments cannot be used), metronidazole 1%, or silver sulfadiazine.

- **Oral antibiotics**: If there is evidence of a superinfection, consider doxycycline 100 mg twice daily, minocycline 100 mg twice daily, or oxytetracycline 500 mg twice daily. These can also provide some anti-inflammatory effects.

- **Topical antipruritics**: Pramoxine 1% or doxepin 5% cream applied twice daily.

- **GABA agonists for severe and refractory pruritus**: Consider gabapentin 300 mg every 8 hours or pregabalin 50–75 mg every 8 hours.

### Efficacy of a moisturizer for pruritus accompanied by xerosis in patients undergoing dialysis: A multicenter, open-label, randomized verification study [^1154aVAn]. The Journal of Dermatology (2021). Low credibility.

This study was a multicenter, open-label, randomized, before-after, parallel-group comparative investigation. Participants were assigned in a 1:1 ratio to groups A and B. In group A, the study product was applied for 2 weeks (period I), while in group B, the product was applied for 8 weeks (2 weeks in period I plus 6 weeks in period II). Randomization of participants occurred prior to treatment commencement. Study assessments were conducted at weeks 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8.

- **Study schedule**: A heparinoid-containing product was applied for 2 weeks in group A and 8 weeks in group B. Informed consent was obtained before treatment began. Efficacy assessments were conducted at weeks 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8. In cases where patients discontinued treatment, final assessments were performed on the day of discontinuation.

The study product used was a heparinoid moisturizer containing glycerin, petrolatum, and squalene as the main additives (Hirudoid Lotion 0.3%; Maruho Co. Ltd. Osaka, Japan). It was applied to dry and itchy areas, including the hypochondriac region, where the WCSC was measured. Generally, application occurred twice daily, in the morning and after bathing (or at bedtime if no bath was taken), but only once daily after dialysis on assessment days, as per the study schedule. The application amount was based on the fingertip unit, with 0.5 g regarded as the quantity needed to cover an area the size of two palms.

### An update on pruritus associated with CKD [^117WKzYp]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

The prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage renal disease is increasing worldwide. Despite improvements in dialysis methods, including the development of novel biocompatible membranes and ultrapure dialysate, CKD-associated pruritus remains a common and significant public health issue. Not only does this distressing symptom profoundly impact quality of life and sleep, but recent evidence also shows that pruritus is associated with poor patient outcomes. Nonetheless, nephrologists and other healthcare professionals often fail to recognize and adequately address the pruritus associated with CKD. The pathophysiological mechanism of CKD-associated pruritus is poorly defined, resulting in challenges in developing specific therapies. The purpose of this review is to highlight the importance of this neglected topic by providing an overview of recent epidemiological studies, outcomes data, proposed pathophysiological mechanisms, and emerging treatment options.

### Nivolumab-associated acute glomerulonephritis: A case report and literature review [^115TRnkR]. BMC Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

One month after discharge, the patient was admitted with a fever, rash, tachycardia, and leukocytosis, consistent with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). The source of infection was unclear as blood and urine cultures were negative. The patient had generalized patchy skin lesions with desquamation, most prominent at the bilateral proximal arms and upper torso. Biopsy of skin lesions was deferred, as they were thought to be an immune-related adverse event (irAE) and were already clinically improving with steroid treatment. The patient was discharged following a short course of intravenous antibiotics. The dose of prednisone was increased at this time.

Another month after the second hospitalization, the patient was re-admitted with fever, tachycardia, and hypotension. Again, there was no compelling source of infection identified after an extensive diagnostic work-up. During the third hospitalization of nine days, he received a stress dose of hydrocortisone 100 mg three times a day. Upon discharge, he resumed a tapering course of steroids, starting with prednisone 60 mg daily. The patient tolerated the prolonged course of oral steroids well with no apparent adverse effects. Oral prednisone was stopped at the end of February 2015.

In April 2015, his serum creatinine level was 1.81 mg/dL and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) was 13 mg/dL. Hemodialysis was discontinued on April 27, 2015. The last contact with the patient was on March 30, 2016, and his kidney function remained stable at the time.

### Novel approach to unpleasant symptom clusters surrounding pruritus in patients with chronic kidney disease and on dialysis therapy [^113ERbdC]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2022). Low credibility.

Despite the clear associations with poorer health outcomes and reduced HRQoL, CKD-aP remains under-appreciated, under-reported, and under-diagnosed. Research focusing on single symptoms has led to significant advances in our understanding of CKD-aP; however, people with advanced kidney disease rarely present with just one symptom. The future of research into symptom management needs to focus on evaluating the relationships between multiple symptoms, specific interventions, and patient outcomes.

- **Symptom clusters**: These are symptoms that share a common mechanism or etiology, and their inter-relationship leads to different outcomes when compared to each individual component symptom.

With new treatment strategies on the horizon, this concept of symptom clusters represents an opportunity not just for the management of CKD-aP but also for all associated symptoms, which we know are important to our patients.

### Efficacy of a moisturizer for pruritus accompanied by xerosis in patients undergoing dialysis: A multicenter, open-label, randomized verification study [^113A2CFQ]. The Journal of Dermatology (2021). Low credibility.

- **Efficacy outcomes**:

- **Primary endpoint - WCSC at week 4**: The WCSC was measured on each day of evaluation 1 to 2 hours after the start of a dialysis session. One site in either the left or right hypochondriac region was designated as the measurement site for each participant. The measurement was conducted using the same instrument as in the previous study (Corneometer and Multi Display Devices MDD4; Courage + Khazaka Electronic GmbH, Köln, Germany). Measurement of the WCSC by the corneometer is based on the electrical capacitance of the skin surface (at approximately 15 µm depth) and values ranging from 0 to 120 arbitrary units (AU) were delivered. On each day of evaluation, the WCSC was measured five times, and the average of the five measurements was recorded.

- **Secondary endpoint - Skin dryness score**: A board‐certified dermatologist centrally rated the severity of skin dryness on a five‐point scale according to the criteria shown in supporting information Table S1, based on photographs of the hypochondriac region (at the measurement site for WCSC) taken on each day of evaluation.

- **Secondary endpoint - Pruritus visual analog scale score**: Participants rated skin pruritus at the study product application site on a 100‐mm visual analog scale (VAS; 0 mm indicating no pruritus and 100 mm indicating the worst possible pruritus) before the start of dialysis on each day of evaluation.

- **Secondary endpoint - DLQI score**: The participants assessed skin disease‐specific QOL at weeks 0, 2, 4, and 8 by completing the DLQI questionnaire, which comprises six domains: "Symptoms and feelings".

### Acute kidney injury from immune checkpoint inhibitor use [^111dZg7h]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). Low credibility.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors are novel oncological medications. Classes include monoclonal antibodies that target inhibitory receptors such as cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4), programmed death 1 protein (PD-1), and programmed death-ligand 1. While these medications are groundbreaking in their ability to treat cancer, they also have a unique spectrum of immune-related adverse events. Renal-related immune adverse events, though rare, are an increasingly recognized clinical entity.

We present the case of a 67-year-old man with acute kidney injury (AKI) after the second cycle of combination anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1 antibodies for metastatic cutaneous melanoma. He presented with vomiting and diarrhea, and AKI secondary to dehydration was treated with aggressive rehydration. After failing to recover biochemically, a renal biopsy was performed, which demonstrated severe acute interstitial nephritis. The culprit medications were held, and he was treated with steroids. With immunosuppression, creatinine improved to pre-treatment values.

### Efficacy of a moisturizer for pruritus accompanied by xerosis in patients undergoing dialysis: A multicenter, open-label, randomized verification study [^115AdJ8h]. The Journal of Dermatology (2021). Low credibility.

The efficacy analysis set comprised participants who used the study product during weeks 0 to 8 and for whom any efficacy data were available. The safety analysis set comprised participants for whom any safety data were available after using the study product.

The analysis of patient demographics included all patients enrolled in the study, with calculation of the summary statistics by group. The primary efficacy endpoint was analyzed with calculation of summary statistics by group, and intergroup comparison was performed with the unpaired t-test. The secondary efficacy endpoints were summarized for each day of evaluation, with calculation of summary statistics by group. The skin dryness score and the pruritus VAS score were compared between the groups using Wilcoxon's rank-sum test or within groups using Wilcoxon's signed-rank test (period I [weeks 1 and 2] vs week 0, and period II [weeks 3, 4, 6, and 8] vs week 2). Other variables were compared between the groups by the unpaired t-test or within a group by the paired t-test (period I vs week 0 and period II vs week 2). In the intergroup comparison, the estimated difference and its 95% confidence interval were calculated. A two-sided test was used for all statistical analysis. The significance level was set at 5% for intergroup comparisons and 2.5% or 1.25% for intragroup comparisons, adjusted for multiplicity using the Bonferroni method.

In the safety evaluation, the number of participants who had adverse events, the number of adverse events, and the incidence of adverse events in periods I was assessed.

### A successful case of dupilumab treatment for severe uremic pruritus [^111k8QT9]. JAAD Case Reports (2019). Low credibility.

A 45-year-old woman was seen at the dermatology practice at Northwestern Medicine for management of severe generalized pruritus. After extensive workup, polycystic kidney disease was diagnosed. The pruritus was initially well controlled with narrow-band ultraviolet B phototherapy (NBUVB) 1 to 2 times per week (> 100 sessions). However, she experienced progressive worsening of renal function and underwent a renal transplant at age 53. The pruritus resolved immediately after transplantation, and phototherapy was discontinued.

At age 55, the generalized pruritus recurred, and renal function slowly began to worsen. The pruritus did not resolve after treatment with NBUVB 2 to 3 times per week (97 sessions), combined with at least one of the following: doxepin, 20 mg daily; aprepitant, 40 mg twice daily; pregabalin, 100 mg daily; naltrexone, 100 mg daily; mirtazapine, 15 mg daily; topical mometasone; pramoxine and menthol; numerous emollients; and other over-the-counter and homeopathic therapies.

Her medical history was significant for stable hypertension and a history of hay fever diagnosed at age 12, which resolved in adulthood. She denied any personal or family history of eczema or asthma. Physical examination was notable for numerous excoriations on the neck, chest, abdomen, back, arms, hands, legs, and feet. No primary inflammatory lesions were observed at any encounter.

Pertinent negative laboratory tests included thyroid-stimulating hormone, bullous pemphigoid antigen 1/2, peripheral hemoglobin, hematocrit, eosinophils, liver enzymes, calcium, phosphorus, and hepatitis.

### Sericin cream reduces pruritus in hemodialysis patients: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled experimental study [^113tFonm]. BMC Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

Itching associated with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), also known as uremic pruritus (UP), affects between 20% and 50% of renal failure patients who have no primary skin disease or systemic or psychological dysfunction that might cause pruritus. Additionally, approximately 80% of patients undergoing hemodialysis have been found to be affected by UP. Unfortunately, dialysis has only a slight impact on pruritus.

Pruritus is an unpleasant symptom that negatively impacts a patient's quality of life. The impact of moderate to severe uremic pruritus on the mortality of patients with ESRD seems to be associated with sleep disturbance rather than uremic pruritus itself. Moreover, in the recent Dialysis Outcomes and Practice Patterns Study II (DOPPS II) trial, pruritus was associated with depression, sleep disturbance, and increased mortality risk. The pathophysiology of UP is still unclear; many hypotheses have been proposed to explain its occurrence, including xerosis and hypohidrosis (a condition in which the skin is usually atrophic and dry), the presence of pruritogenic cytokines (histamine, kallikrein, interleukin [IL]-2, acetylcholine, and other substances that are released by histamine-mediated mast cell stimulation and may lower the UP threshold), secondary hyperparathyroidism, immune-inflammatory reactions where sericin cream is thought to play a central role in producing an anti-inflammatory effect, the uremic neuropathy hypothesis, and the opioid hypothesis (k-opioid receptor understimulation and overexpression of μ-opioid receptors).

### Lyrica [^111XYgM7]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

In view of dose-dependent adverse reactions and since Lyrica is eliminated primarily by renal excretion, adjust the dose in adult patients with reduced renal function. The use of Lyrica in pediatric patients with compromised renal function has not been studied. Base the dose adjustment in patients with renal impairment on creatinine clearance (CLcr), as indicated in Table 2. To use this dosing table, an estimate of the patient's CLcr in mL/min is needed. CLcr in mL/min may be estimated from serum creatinine (mg/dL) determination using the Cockcroft and Gault equation:

Next, refer to the Dosage and Administration section to determine the recommended total daily dose based on indication, for a patient with normal renal function (CLcr greater than or equal to 60 mL/min). Then refer to Table 2 to determine the corresponding renal adjusted dose.

For example: A patient initiating Lyrica therapy for postherpetic neuralgia with normal renal function (CLcr greater than or equal to 60 mL/min) receives a total daily dose of 150 mg/day pregabalin. Therefore, a renal impaired patient with a CLcr of 50 mL/min would receive a total daily dose of 75 mg/day pregabalin administered in two or three divided doses.

For patients undergoing hemodialysis, adjust the pregabalin daily dose based on renal function. In addition to the daily dose adjustment, administer a supplemental dose immediately following every 4-hour hemodialysis treatment (see Table 2).

### Rifadin IV [^115bk5Rs]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Renal: Elevations in BUN and serum uric acid have been reported. Rarely, hemolysis, hemoglobinuria, hematuria, interstitial nephritis, acute tubular necrosis, renal insufficiency, and acute renal failure have been noted. These are generally considered to be hypersensitivity reactions. They usually occur during intermittent therapy or when treatment is resumed following intentional or accidental interruption of a daily dosage regimen, and are reversible when rifampin is discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted.

Dermatologic: Cutaneous reactions are mild and self-limiting, and do not appear to be hypersensitivity reactions. Typically, they consist of flushing and itching with or without a rash. More serious cutaneous reactions, which may be due to hypersensitivity, occur but are uncommon.

Hypersensitivity reactions: Occasionally, pruritus, urticaria, rash, pemphigoid reaction, erythema multiforme, acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms syndrome (see WARNINGS), vasculitis, eosinophilia, sore mouth, sore tongue, and conjunctivitis have been observed. Anaphylaxis has been reported rarely.

Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: Pulmonary toxicity (including, but not limited to, interstitial lung disease, pneumonitis, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, eosinophilic pneumonia, pulmonary infiltrates, organizing pneumonia, respiratory failure, pulmonary fibrosis, and acute respiratory distress syndrome) has been observed (see WARNINGS).

### Sericin cream reduces pruritus in hemodialysis patients: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled experimental study [^113Up4Wc]. BMC Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

The pathogenesis of ESRD itself is associated with inflammation and oxidative stress, as reflected in studies of plasma biochemistry, including the levels of the cytokines IL and TNF-α, which are classic markers of inflammatory processes that are strongly affected by pathological conditions. These cytokines are upregulated in the plasma of ESRD patients. The skin inflammation associated with the release of IL and TNF-α is further complicated by the inflammatory lesions that occur secondary to scratching. Our results indicate that improvement in skin hydration and suppression of the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines in skin might be the mechanism by which sericin improves UP. Skin irritation, which can be caused by either skin inflammation or by scratching, was substantially reduced in the sericin group compared with the cream base group after six weeks of treatment. This result confirmed that sericin reduces skin irritation in patients with UP and suggested that it might be due to suppression of the inflammatory cytokines in skin. Similar results have been obtained in animal studies.

### Understanding pruritus in systemic disease [^114PJjKT]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2001). Low credibility.

Many pruritic conditions do not originate in the skin but result from systemic abnormalities. Among the diseases that can cause pruritus are renal insufficiency, cholestasis, Hodgkin's lymphoma, polycythemia vera, and solid tumors, among many others. Other pruritic conditions appear to be iatrogenic; opioid-induced pruritus may be the most important in palliative medicine. Successful treatment of the underlying condition usually relieves itch. However, with time, many diseases progress, and treatment of the cause may become impossible. Topical treatments may be of limited value.

- **Strategies involving systemic treatments**: Use of antidepressants, oral opioid antagonists, or cholestyramine. There is no single cure for all pruritic symptoms, but a better understanding of the mechanisms of pruritus may help develop more effective treatments.

### Diagnosis and treatment of secondary nephrotic syndrome with rash as the first symptom: a case report [^115M11cU]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Low credibility.

Nephrotic syndrome (NS) is a group of clinical manifestations characterized by massive proteinuria (> 3.5 g/d) with hypoalbuminemia (< 30 g/L), edema, and hyperlipidemia, as well as other complications. Numerous conditions, including infection, secretory metabolism, autoimmune disease, and cancer, might have a secondary effect on NS. Renal biopsy and immunohistochemistry are required for patients with NS of unclear cause when necessary. This article describes a rare instance of NS secondary to mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) with a rash as the initial sign; following chemotherapy, the patient's renal function recovered.

### Sericin cream reduces pruritus in hemodialysis patients: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled experimental study [^115gaVSL]. BMC Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

Uremic pruritus (UP) is a significant complication in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and substantially impairs their quality of life. UP is considered to be a skin manifestation of chronic inflammation. Because sericin can suppress the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, the purpose of this study was to investigate the short-term safety and efficacy of sericin cream for treating UP in hemodialysis patients.

- **Methods**: This study used a double-blind design to investigate the effects of random topical administration of sericin cream and cream base (placebo) on either the right or left extremities of hemodialysis patients for six weeks. Skin hydration, irritation, and pigmentation were evaluated every two weeks using Skin Diagnostic SD27. The visual analog scale for itching was also evaluated every two weeks, and the Kidney Disease Quality of Life Short Form was performed on the day of each patient's enrollment and after six weeks of treatment.

- **Results**: Fifty dialysis patients were enrolled, 47 of whom completed the study. The hydration of the skin of the patients' extremities increased significantly after administration of sericin cream; significant differences were found between sericin treatment and control after six weeks of treatment (p = 0.041 for arms and p = 0.022 for legs, respectively). Moreover, a significant difference was also found in skin irritation between the two treatments (p = 0.013 for arms and p = 0.027 for legs, respectively). At the end of the study, the skin pigmentation level was significantly reduced on both the arms (p = 0.032) and legs (p = 0.021) of the sericin-treated group.

### Linezolid-associated acute interstitial nephritis and drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome [^113dywio]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Linezolid is a recent addition to the antibiotic arsenal against Gram-positive bacteria, including multiresistant staphylococci and enterococci. Although it is generally well tolerated and not considered nephrotoxic, we report the case of an 88-year-old woman who was treated for prosthetic joint infection and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia with vancomycin followed by linezolid therapy. On day 7 of linezolid treatment, the patient developed severe pruritus, macular rash, facial edema, eosinophilia, a marked increase in serum creatinine level, and mild hepatitis. Renal biopsy revealed acute interstitial nephritis with eosinophilic cells.

Discontinuation of linezolid and a short course of prednisone led to rapid improvement of renal function. This case of linezolid-associated acute interstitial nephritis, within the context of a drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome, raises concerns about the presumed renal safety of this drug. Clinicians should be aware of this potentially life-threatening adverse reaction and monitor kidney function while patients are using linezolid.

### A case of sulphasalazine-induced dress syndrome with delayed acute interstitial nephritis [^1124qrEU]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2009). Low credibility.

Drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS syndrome) is a rare and severe drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome characterized by hematological abnormalities (hypereosinophilia and/or mononucleosis) and multiorgan involvement. Renal failure has been rarely described. We report the case of a 77-year-old female with sulphasalazine-induced DRESS syndrome who improved rapidly on corticosteroid treatment. After prednisone withdrawal, the patient developed renal failure that necessitated a session of hemodialysis. A kidney biopsy showed acute tubulointerstitial nephritis with an intense lymphocytic infiltrate and tubular necrosis. Kidney function normalized following a further 2 weeks of corticosteroid treatment. This is the first histologically proven case of acute tubulointerstitial nephritis in the setting of sulphasalazine-induced DRESS syndrome.

### The nephrotoxicity of vancomycin [^113sXCee]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2017). Low credibility.

Various novel blood and urine biomarkers have been studied for their ability to detect impending acute kidney injury (AKI) prior to the standard measures, i.e. serum creatinine and urine output. These include neutrophil gelatinase‐associated lipocalin, kidney injury molecule‐1, insulin‐like growth factor‐binding protein 7, and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases‐2, among others. A number of these have been qualified by the FDA and European Medicines Agency for nonclinical animal toxicology evaluation of new drug entities. No studies have specifically addressed the utility of any biomarkers for the early detection of vancomycin nephrotoxicity in humans, although limited preclinical data exist. An in‐depth discussion of biomarkers is beyond the scope of this article.

The onset of vancomycin-associated nephrotoxicity (VANT) typically occurs after about 4–8 days of therapy. A systematic review by van Hal et al. found a mean range of nephrotoxicity occurrence of 4.3–17 days after initiation of vancomycin. Onset as early as 2 to 3 days of therapy has been reported. In general, about three‐quarters of patients will have improvement or resolution by the time of discharge, often within a week or less, including patients remaining on vancomycin after the onset of nephrotoxicity. Dialysis has been rarely necessary in any study, with an overall incidence of 3% in the van Hal et al. review. As expected, however, VANT is associated with increased mortality and length of stay in the ICU and hospital.

### Efficacy of a moisturizer for pruritus accompanied by xerosis in patients undergoing dialysis: A multicenter, open-label, randomized verification study [^114kiQNx]. The Journal of Dermatology (2021). Low credibility.

The study participants were clinically stable patients with chronic kidney disease undergoing hemodialysis. Their ages ranged from 20 to 80 years on the day they gave informed consent, and all had been diagnosed with xerosis in the hypochondriac region and dialysis-associated pruritus at the start of the study treatment. Fully informed written consent was obtained from all participants before enrollment. Patients were excluded if they had used any moisturizer (heparinoid-containing products, urea preparations, or petrolatum) within three weeks before the scheduled start day of the study treatment, had a history of allergy to any heparinoid-containing product, or were otherwise ineligible for this study in the opinion of the investigator. The target sample size was set at 38 participants per group based on the results of our preceding exploratory study, assuming an intergroup difference of 7.61 in the mean WCSC at week 4 (the primary endpoint of this study) with a standard deviation of 9 for both groups, a 1:1 randomization ratio, a 5% two-sided significance level, 90% power, and allowance for a 20% dropout rate.

- **Study variables**:

	- **Patient demographics**: Sex, age, height, and body weight were recorded on the day on which participants gave informed consent.

	- **Adherence to study treatment**: Adherence to study treatment was assessed at weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8 based on the patient's self-completed diary and an interview with the participant. The following five categories were used to assess adherence: "completely or nearly as directed".

### Nephrogenic fibrosing dermopathy: A novel cutaneous fibrosing disorder in patients with renal failure [^111pTyuM]. The American Journal of Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Nephrogenic fibrosing dermopathy is a newly recognized cutaneous fibrosing disorder marked by the acute onset of induration involving the upper and lower limbs in patients with acute or chronic renal failure. The etiology, pathogenesis, associated clinical conditions (other than renal failure), and ultimate course have not been defined in the few cases studied. Presently, there is no effective treatment, and the condition persists in most patients.

- **Methods**: Clinical and histopathologic data on 13 patients from our institution with the diagnosis of nephrogenic fibrosing dermopathy were reviewed. Several clinical and laboratory parameters were examined to see if any were consistently associated with the disease. Biopsy specimens were analyzed to determine if there was a pattern to the evolution of fibrosis in these patients.

- **Results**: All 13 patients had renal failure before disease onset: 8 were undergoing chronic hemodialysis, 2 were undergoing chronic peritoneal dialysis, and 3 with acute renal failure had never undergone dialysis before the development of dermopathy. Most patients had other serious underlying medical conditions. Many patients were taking erythropoietin, cyclosporine, or both before the onset of disease. In transplant patients, no histocompatibility antigens were found to be associated with the disease. There were various laboratory abnormalities, but none were consistently associated with the condition. In skin biopsy specimens taken 7 to 180 days after disease onset, there were histopathologic changes suggestive of a tissue reaction to injury.

### Diagnosis and management of immune checkpoint inhibitor-associated renal toxicity: Illustrative case and review [^111Acexy]. The Oncologist (2019). Low credibility.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are monoclonal antibodies directed at negative regulatory components on T cells, such as cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4, programmed cell death-1 (PD-1), and its ligand, programmed cell death ligand-1. ICIs initiate antitumor immunity; however, these agents are associated with immune-related adverse events (irAEs) that may affect a variety of organs. Renal irAEs most commonly present with asymptomatic acute kidney injury (AKI), which is often detected by routine laboratory testing. The severity of AKI associated with irAEs ranges from mild (grade 1–2) to severe (grade 3–4). It is often challenging to diagnose because this group of patients often has multiple reasons to have AKI, such as dehydration, sepsis, or nephrotoxic medication exposure.

We present an illustrative case of a 60-year-old man with metastatic melanoma who developed AKI during treatment with nivolumab and review the literature to address frequently asked questions concerning the diagnosis and management of renal irAEs in patients with advanced cancer. Importantly, most patients will recover completely, and some may tolerate a rechallenge of ICI therapy with prompt and effective treatment.

- **Key points**: Renal immune-related adverse events (irAEs) are less frequently reported than other irAEs; however, it is possible that available data underestimate their true incidence due to missed diagnoses and under-reporting. Although severe renal irAEs are more easily detected, smaller rises in creatinine may not be appreciated or may be attributed to other causes.

### Sericin cream reduces pruritus in hemodialysis patients: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled experimental study [^116yRbny]. BMC Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

Uremic pruritus (UP) is a significant complication in ESRD patients and substantially impairs their quality of life. UP is considered to be a skin manifestation of chronic inflammation. Because sericin can suppress the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, the purpose of this study was to investigate the short-term safety and efficacy of sericin cream for treating UP in hemodialysis patients.

- **Methods**: This study used a double-blind design to investigate the effects of random topical administration of sericin cream and a cream base (placebo) on either the right or left extremities of hemodialysis patients for 6 weeks. Skin hydration, irritation, and pigmentation were evaluated every 2 weeks using Skin Diagnostic SD27. The visual analog scale for itching was also evaluated every 2 weeks, and the Kidney Disease Quality of Life Short Form was performed on the day of each patient's enrollment and after 6 weeks of treatment.

- **Results**: Fifty dialysis patients were enrolled, 47 of whom completed the study. The hydration of the skin on the patients' extremities increased significantly after administration of sericin cream; significant differences were found between sericin treatment and control after 6 weeks of treatment (p = 0.041 for arms and p = 0.022 for legs, respectively). Moreover, a significant difference was found in skin irritation between the two treatments (p = 0.013 for arms and p = 0.027 for legs, respectively). At the end of the study, the skin pigmentation level was significantly reduced on both the arms (p = 0.032) and legs (p = 0.021) of the sericin-treated side.

### A protracted, postherpetic neuralgic ulcer treated with risperidone and intranasal butorphanol [^113LbZWV]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

A 67-year-old woman with end-stage renal disease, currently on maintenance hemodialysis, presented to the dermatology clinic in January 2020. She reported a 2-year history of a progressively worsening ulcer on the left side of her neck, associated with moderate pain and intense pruritus. The patient quantified the pruritus on the peak pruritus numerical rating scale (PP-NRS) as an average of 10 (0–10). It worsened at night and disrupted her sleep.

In 2017, the patient experienced an episode of herpes zoster that affected the left side of her neck, resulting in pruritus and pain. She described the pain as a constant burning and shock-like sensation, leading to regular picking, rubbing, and scratching of the affected area. A biopsy of the affected area was performed, and histopathologic analysis revealed marked hyperkeratosis with foci of parakeratosis, epidermal acanthosis with irregular elongation of the rete ridges, hypergranulosis, a prominent stratum lucidum, and a patchy lymphocytic infiltrate distributed in perivascular collections within the papillary dermis, consistent with neurodermatitis.

Treatments from that time to the presentation at our clinic included pregabalin 50 mg once daily for 1 year, mirtazapine 15 mg nightly for 8 months, oxycodone 30 mg daily for 1 month, cyclosporine 100 mg twice daily for 1 month, botulinum toxin injections, and a left stellate ganglion block. Of these, pregabalin, oxycodone, botulinum toxin injections, and the stellate ganglion block produced a moderate reduction in pain but no effect on pruritus. Oxycodone worsened the pruritus.

### Diagnosis of common dermopathies in dialysis patients: a review and update [^1119UTQW]. Seminars in Dialysis (2012). Low credibility.

Cutaneous abnormalities in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) receiving hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis may demonstrate signs of their underlying condition or reveal associated disease entities. While a thorough examination of the scalp, skin, mucosa, and nails is integral to establishing a diagnosis, certain conditions will resolve only with dialysis or improvement of their renal disease, and others may not require or respond to treatment. Half and half nails, pruritus, xerosis, and cutaneous hyperpigmentation are common manifestations in ESRD. With hemodialysis, uremic frost is no longer prevalent in ESRD patients, and ecchymoses have decreased in incidence.

Acquired perforating dermatoses are seen in over one-tenth of hemodialysis patients. Metastatic calcinosis cutis and calciphylaxis are both rarely reported, although the latter is seen almost exclusively in the setting of hemodialysis. Diagnosis of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis has historically been challenging; as such, new diagnostic criteria have been proposed. Blood porphyrin profiles are needed to differentiate between porphyria cutanea tarda and pseudoporphyria. We will review and provide an update on the aforementioned common cutaneous manifestations of ESRD in patients receiving dialysis.

### Efficacy of a moisturizer for pruritus accompanied by xerosis in patients undergoing dialysis: A multicenter, open-label, randomized verification study [^1168riG2]. The Journal of Dermatology (2021). High credibility.

We previously conducted an exploratory study of 12 patients with chronic kidney disease and xerosis undergoing hemodialysis. The results suggested the effectiveness of a moisturizer for xerosis and associated pruritus in these patients. In that study, we evaluated a 2-week (group A) versus a 4-week (group B) application of a heparinoid-containing product, with weekly measurement of the water content of the stratum corneum (WCSC). The WCSC increased in both groups up to week 2 and was then maintained in group B up to week 4, but decreased in group A after week 2. However, a significant difference in the WCSC at week 4 (the primary endpoint of the study) was not observed between the two groups, possibly due to an insufficient sample size. Pruritus improved during treatment with the study product and deteriorated after the end of the moisturizer application in group A, with a significant difference between the two groups at week 4 (P = 0.01, paired t-test).

The present confirmatory study was designed with an adequate sample size based on the preceding study results. The DLQI was used as an additional endpoint to investigate the influence of a heparinoid-containing product on QOL.

### Sericin cream reduces pruritus in hemodialysis patients: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled experimental study [^114wfLva]. BMC Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

Secondary skin lesions that can result from the itch-scratch cycle include excoriations, hyperpigmentation, lichenification, prurigo nodules, and scars. Chronic renal failure is usually accompanied by a variety of cutaneous manifestations. Dermal manifestations, including hyperpigmentation, have also been reported, and these can exact a considerable toll on the quality of life. Although skin pigmentation is not related to specific clinical symptoms, it has an important effect on patient satisfaction. Sericin has been reported to have activity against tyrosinase, an enzyme related to melanin production. As this study shows, treatment with sericin results in a significant reduction in the skin color of patients.

The pruritus/mortality relationship may be strongly attributed to sleep disturbances, as previously mentioned in the DOPPS. Many previous studies have found a strong association between inflammation, as measured by C-reactive protein or inflammatory cytokines, and sleep disturbances in dialysis patients. The significant effects of pruritus on sleep, mood, and social functioning require further investigation with the goal of improving the available treatments for this serious ESRD complication. We found that a reduction in itching intensity from moderate to severe pruritus at the time of enrollment to mild pruritus after six weeks of treatment was associated with a better quality of life in all of the measured domains, including the mental, physical, and kidney disease components. The KDQOL-SF score in the ESRD patients indicated improvements in several domains.

### The rash that leads to eschar formation [^114eJZY4]. Clinics in Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

When confronted with an existent or evolving eschar, the history is often the most important factor used to put the lesion into proper context. Determining whether the patient has a past medical history of significance, such as renal failure or diabetes mellitus, exposure to dead or live wildlife, or underwent a recent surgical procedure, can help differentiate between many etiologies of eschars. Similarly, the patient's overall clinical condition and the presence or absence of fever can allow infectious processes to be differentiated from other causes. This contribution is intended to help dermatologists identify and manage these various dermatologic conditions, as well as provide an algorithm that can be utilized when approaching a patient presenting with an eschar.

### Hypersensitive reactions during hemodialysis treatment: What do we need to know [^112yXeuB]. Seminars in Dialysis (2024). Low credibility.

Kidney replacement therapies (KRTs), including hemodialysis (HD), are among the treatment options for most patients with end-stage kidney disease. Although HD is vital for these patients, it is not entirely physiological, and various adverse events, including hypersensitivity reactions, may occur. Fortunately, these reactions are rare overall and less frequent compared to previous decades. However, they remain significant for at least two reasons:

- **Growing patient numbers**: The number of patients receiving kidney replacement treatment is increasing globally, and the cumulative number of these reactions may be substantial.
- **Severity of reactions**: While most of these reactions are mild, some can be very severe and even lead to mortality.

Thus, it is very important to have basic knowledge and skills to diagnose and treat these reactions. Hypersensitivity reactions can occur at any component of the dialysis machinery, including access points, the extracorporeal circuit, and medications. The most crucial preventive measure is to avoid the allergen. However, even with very specific tests, sometimes the allergen cannot be identified. In mild conditions, HD reactions can be managed with non-specific treatments such as topical creams, antihistamines, and corticosteroids. In more severe conditions, treatment must be stopped immediately, blood should not be returned to the patient, all drugs must be halted, and general emergency treatment protocols must be followed.

### Drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms syndrome and renal toxicity with a nevirapine-containing regimen in a pregnant patient with human immunodeficiency virus [^114Qeq6m]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2003). Low credibility.

Antiretroviral therapy is associated with serious adverse events. We report the case of a pregnant human immunodeficiency virus type 1-infected woman who developed drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms syndrome and renal failure shortly after initiation of a nevirapine-containing antiretroviral regimen at 27 weeks' gestation.

- **Case**: A 26-year-old primigravida presented with a fever of 40.2°C, urticarial rash, and icteric sclera 6 weeks after starting a nevirapine-containing antiretroviral regimen. Eosinophils, serum creatinine, bilirubin, and liver enzymes were markedly elevated, and abnormal coagulation studies were noted on admission. Serology testing was negative for viral hepatitis, and microbiologic cultures were negative for growth. Abnormal laboratory findings at discharge resolved within 4 months after discontinuation of antiretroviral agents and systemic corticosteroid therapy.

- **Conclusion**: Our case suggests the need for close monitoring of liver and renal function after initiation of nevirapine-containing antiretroviral regimens.

### Gabapentin therapy for pruritus in haemodialysis patients: a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial [^1136qDj8]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2004). Low credibility.

Uraemic pruritus is a common and distressing symptom in patients on haemodialysis for chronic renal failure. Gabapentin is an anticonvulsant that alleviates neuropathic pain. We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study to assess its effectiveness against renal itch.

- **Methods**: We enrolled in the trial 25 adult patients on haemodialysis who were asked to daily record the severity of their pruritus on a visual analogue scale. The patients were randomly assigned to receive gabapentin for 4 weeks followed by placebo for 4 weeks or the reverse sequence. Gabapentin or placebo were administered thrice weekly, at the end of haemodialysis sessions.

- **Results**: The mean pruritus score of the cohort before the study was 8.4 ± 0.94. After placebo intake, it decreased to 7.6 ± 2.6 (P = 0.098). The score of four patients decreased by > 50% following placebo. After gabapentin administration, the mean score decreased significantly, to 1.2 ± 1.8 (P = 0.0001), although one patient's symptoms did not improve significantly. No patient dropped out of the study due to adverse effects from gabapentin.

- **Conclusions**: Our study shows that gabapentin is safe and effective for treating uraemic pruritus in haemodialysis patients. Our results also support the neuropathic hypothesis of uraemic pruritus.

### Practical guide for the diagnosis and treatment of localized and generalized cutaneous pruritus (chronic itch with no underlying pruritic dermatosis) [^116SLX8C]. The Journal of Dermatology (2025). Low credibility.

An imbalance in the endogenous opioid system is also an important player in itch in hemodialysis patients, who exhibit increased MOR activity and decreased KOR activity. KOR agonists, such as nalfurafine and difelikefalin, have been reported to reduce itch severity in patients on hemodialysis in clinical trials. Furthermore, difelikefalin has been shown to improve CKD-aP in nondialysis-dependent patients.

Microinflammation in the skin may contribute to CKD-aP. Serum C-reactive protein levels and serum IL-2 levels are correlated with itch severity in hemodialysis patients. Uremic neuropathy and paresthesia, which includes restless leg syndrome, have been reported to be associated with CKD-aP. Functional and structural alterations in the brain, as revealed through functional magnetic resonance imaging studies, have also been reported to be associated with CKD-aP.

- **Treatment approaches for CKD-aP**: Include topical emollients, opioid modulators, phototherapy, antidepressants, and GABAergic drugs. Dry skin is a common occurrence in patients undergoing hemodialysis and is often accompanied by pruritus. Topical emollients provide at least partial relief from hemodialysis-associated itch. Opioid modulators not only act on the endogenous opioid system but also improve microinflammation in the periphery. Phototherapy also targets microinflammation in the skin. GABAergic drugs and antidepressants modulate neuronal activities in both the peripheral and central nervous systems.

### Pregabalin-induced urticarial rash and neutropenia in a renal transplant recipient: A case report [^1119h7JF]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Low credibility.

A 37-year-old Caucasian renal transplant recipient was admitted with a two-day history of lethargy, sore throat, abdominal tenderness around his transplant site, and arthralgia in his elbows, knees, and ankles. Regarding his past medical history, he had focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, which eventually led to end-stage renal disease for which he received his first renal transplant in 2000. This gradually failed due to chronic allograft nephropathy, leading to a subsequent transplant in 2011, with an angioplasty performed in 2013 due to transplant renal artery stenosis. Additionally, he suffered from asthma. Prior to admission, there was no history of recent foreign travel or contact with anyone with recent travel or similar symptoms. His medication list included tacrolimus, azathioprine, prednisolone, aspirin, omeprazole, and calcium carbonate plus cholecalciferol. He had been started on pregabalin by his general practitioner (GP) 2 weeks prior to admission because of a two-month history of severe pain in his shinbones, which was interpreted as neuropathic pain. He had no known drug allergies.

On physical examination, the patient had discrete patches of urticarial rash, notably a 12 × 8 cm erythematous urticarial rash overlying his renal transplant scar, which was tender on palpation. Similar smaller circular areas of erythema were observed on the back of his right elbow, left knee, and left anterior wrist. His chest was clear, heart sounds were normal with no murmurs, blood pressure and heart rate were within normal limits, and he was afebrile.

### Practical use of patient-reported outcome measures in chronic kidney disease-associated pruritus [^116bwAh9]. Journal of Renal Nutrition (2024). Low credibility.

Regulatory and clinical stakeholders are increasingly advocating for the use of patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures; however, the use of PROs is still not widespread. Patient reports are often the best ways to diagnose and monitor the effect of treatment on symptoms when the symptoms are subjective, as with pruritus. While many PRO tools are available to assess the severity of pruritus and its impact on quality of life (e.g. sleep), these tools are not used consistently, and their results may not translate into clinical action. This article presents an introduction to PROs and their use in assessing chronic kidney disease-associated pruritus. It provides a practical guide to some of the PRO tools currently available, aiming to empower all members of the nephrology patient care team to use these tools appropriately for the benefit of the patient.

### Cutaneous manifestations of dialysis-associated steal syndrome in a patient with end-stage renal disease [^115pDakf]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Low credibility.

Although dialysis-associated steal syndrome (DASS) is well known in the field of vascular surgery, it is less commonly encountered by dermatologists. Clinicians must be familiar with the dermatologic manifestations of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), especially in patients with arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs). Digital pain in the setting of a nonhealing skin biopsy site and onychodystrophy should raise concern for vascular etiology. Without revascularization, many patients with DASS endure detrimental complications such as tissue necrosis and potential amputation of the affected digits. Therefore, prompt recognition of DASS by dermatologists can be potentially limb- and life-saving.

### Pruritus in chronic kidney disease [^1153PTJf]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2022). Low credibility.

Among the many difficult symptoms that patients with kidney disease experience, pruritus is one of the most frequent and troubling. Because a substantial amount of new information has accumulated, we seek here to review the subject.

- **Recent findings**: Pruritus is not only a common problematic symptom among patients with kidney disease, but it is considerably more frequent than nephrologists recognize. The result for patients is not just an uncomfortable itch but a degraded quality of life as well. The pathogenesis is increasingly understood, but many aspects remain to be fully resolved. Importantly, research is progressing on treatment, leading to the first approved medication in the United States, difelikefalin, in August 2021.

- **Summary**: As nephrology is progressing to a greater focus on patient symptoms, recognition of the importance of pruritus has led to increased interest and improved diagnosis and treatment options.

- **Clinical course of GPP**: What is the clinical course of GPP?
	- A. GPP has a relapsing remitting course or persisting with intermittent flares – Correct. The clinical course of GPP is heterogeneous, with a relapsing remitting course or persisting with intermittent flares. The course and symptom severity may vary with each flare.
	- B. Mortality rate in GPP is > 50% – Incorrect. The literature highlights that the mortality rate ranges from 4% to 24%. The most common causes of mortality include sepsis and multiorgan failure.
	- C. Older patients have a better prognosis compared with younger – Incorrect. Particularly in older patients, GPP can be life-threatening, and about 5% to 10% of GPP flares are fatal.
	- D. In most cases, GPP is not associated with any systemic complications – Incorrect. GPP flares are frequently accompanied by systemic symptoms, including fever, malaise, and leukocytosis, and may lead to hospitalization and life-threatening complications. The complications and morbidity from GPP include pneumonia, liver damage, hypoalbuminemia, hypocalcaemia, renal tubular necrosis, malnutrition, and cardiorespiratory failure.
	- E. Most patients will not have any recurrence of the disease – Incorrect. GPP is a potentially life-threatening disease that may present with repeated acute episodes.

### Cutaneous manifestations of chronic kidney disease [^113u9Qyr]. Clinics in Dermatology (2008).

Among the most common systemic diseases associated with cutaneous manifestations is kidney failure. Most of these occur in the setting of chronic kidney disease. In the following review, we focus on six conditions in detail: pruritus, acquired perforating dermatoses, nail disorders, bullous disorders, calciphylaxis, and nephrogenic fibrosing dermopathy.
