## Question

Can I get infection by hepatitis B from sweat

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking if they can get hepatitis B from sweat and, if so, under what circumstances the risk becomes meaningful. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the established routes of HBV transmission and which body fluids are considered infectious. Then, I should verify what authoritative guidelines say specifically about sweat. Next, I will examine experimental and observational data that detect HBV DNA in sweat and assess whether that translates into proven transmission. After that, I need to consider mechanistic plausibility, including viral load, portal of entry, and environmental stability. Finally, I will synthesize a practical risk assessment and outline prevention and counseling points, making sure I distinguish theoretical risk from documented transmission events.

> Let me first confirm the canonical transmission routes so I don't jump to conclusions. HBV is transmitted through percutaneous or mucosal exposure to infectious blood or certain body fluids, with the highest concentrations in blood and meaningful levels in semen, vaginal secretions, and saliva; urine, feces, and sweat are not considered efficient vehicles unless visibly contaminated with blood, which frames the baseline risk assessment for sweat as very low in ordinary circumstances [^114fqw85] [^117CpQMP] [^113z54DA].

> Wait, let me verify what the major guidelines actually say about sweat specifically. Standard precautions explicitly exclude sweat from the list of fluids requiring barrier precautions, underscoring that sweat is not regarded as a high-risk fluid in routine healthcare, and contemporary hepatology guidelines emphasize that HBV is not spread by casual contact, reinforcing that ordinary sweat exposure should not transmit infection [^114j4Jdx] [^11393JeB] [^111BNLWU].

> Hold on, let's not dismiss the possibility just because guidelines de-emphasize sweat; I should check whether HBV DNA has been detected in sweat. A study of Olympic wrestlers found HBV DNA in sweat of some athletes with occult infection and showed a correlation between serum and sweat viral loads, suggesting that sweat can carry HBV genetic material when viremia is present, although detection of DNA does not prove infectivity without viable virions and an appropriate portal of entry [^111MSjdR]. Let me also consider related fluids: saliva can contain substantial HBV DNA in high-viremic patients, and tears have yielded infectious virus in experimental models, which supports the plausibility that sweat could, in theory, be infectious if viral load is high and exposure conditions permit blood-to-blood contact [^116gyN1y] [^115iGkvb].

> I need to ensure I weigh mechanistic plausibility carefully. Transmission requires sufficient infectious dose, a permissive portal such as broken skin or mucosa, and environmental conditions that preserve viability; HBV remains infectious on surfaces for days, but sweat typically has far lower viral concentrations than blood or semen, and intact skin is an effective barrier, so the main concern would be sweat contaminated with blood entering open wounds or mucosa during vigorous contact sports or similar scenarios [^114fqw85] [^112ysKnK]. But wait, what if the athlete has high-level viremia and actively bleeding abrasions? In that edge case, the risk is driven less by sweat per se and more by the admixture of blood and the opportunity for percutaneous inoculation, which aligns with the general principle that non-bloody sweat is not an efficient vehicle [^114fqw85].

> Next, I should review whether there is documented transmission attributable to sweat alone. I should double-check the sports literature and outbreak reports. Documented HBV transmission in sports has been described in small clusters of wrestlers and football players, but these reports predate modern molecular epidemiology and likely reflect transmission via blood exposure during cuts and abrasions rather than sweat-only routes; contemporary sports medicine estimates suggest an extremely low risk of HBV transmission per game contact, consistent with negligible risk in the absence of blood-to-blood exposure [^112ysKnK] [^115Hv7xE]. Let me reconsider: I initially worried there might be robust evidence of sweat-only transmission, but I can't find well-documented cases where sweat without visible blood caused infection, which supports the conclusion that theoretical risk has not translated into proven transmission in controlled observations [^112ysKnK].

> I will now examine how this should influence counseling and prevention. For everyday activities, sweat exposure should not be a concern, and people with HBV should not be restricted from sports, school, or social contact; standard precautions in healthcare still exclude sweat, and vaccination remains the cornerstone of prevention for contacts at risk, with post-exposure protocols reserved for identifiable exposures to blood or high-risk body fluids rather than sweat [^11393JeB] [^114j4Jdx] [^113tL6Wx]. For contact sports, I should confirm that recommendations emphasize vaccination, prompt care of open wounds, and adherence to infection control practices rather than exclusion of athletes with HBV, aligning with the principle that the risk is contextual and largely mediated by blood exposure rather than sweat itself [^112ysKnK] [^11393JeB].

> Putting this together, I should conclude clearly. No, hepatitis B is not transmitted by sweat under ordinary circumstances; however, in rare, high-risk settings involving vigorous contact sports with open wounds and high viremia, sweat contaminated with blood could theoretically contribute to transmission if it gains access to nonintact skin or mucosa, which is why vaccination, wound care, and standard precautions are the key mitigations rather than avoiding sweat exposure per se [^114fqw85] [^112ysKnK] [^11393JeB].

No, hepatitis B is **not transmitted through sweat** under normal circumstances [^114fqw85]. HBV is spread via blood, semen, vaginal fluids, and saliva — not by sweat, tears, urine, or feces unless visibly contaminated with blood [^117CpQMP] [^114fqw85] [^111ya16Y]. There is **no evidence of HBV transmission from sweat alone** in everyday contact or sports [^115Hv7xE]. The risk is negligible unless sweat is mixed with blood and enters broken skin or mucous membranes [^114fqw85]. Standard precautions and vaccination are the key preventive measures [^114j4Jdx] [^113tL6Wx].

---

## Evidence regarding hepatitis B transmission through sweat

- **Body fluids with detectable HBV DNA**: HBV DNA has been detected in sweat, but at much lower levels than in blood or semen, and sweat is not considered infectious under normal conditions [^114fqw85] [^111MSjdR].

- **Infectious body fluids**: HBV is transmitted through blood, semen, vaginal secretions, and saliva; sweat is not a recognized route of transmission [^117CpQMP] [^113z54DA].

- **Sports context**: In contact sports, transmission risk is associated with blood-to-blood exposure (e.g. open wounds, bleeding), not sweat alone [^115Hv7xE].

---

## Factors influencing transmission risk through sweat

Transmission via sweat is **extremely unlikely** unless the following conditions are present:

| **Factor** | **Influence on transmission risk** |
|-|-|
| Presence of blood in sweat | Significantly increases risk if sweat is visibly contaminated with blood and enters broken skin or mucous membranes [^114fqw85] |
| Viral load in sweat | Lower viral load in sweat compared to blood or semen reduces risk significantly [^114fqw85] |
| Route of exposure | Percutaneous or mucosal exposure to blood-contaminated sweat increases risk [^114fqw85] |
| Immune status of exposed individual | Unvaccinated individuals are at higher risk if exposed to blood-contaminated sweat [^111ya16Y] |

---

## Epidemiological evidence and case reports

There is **no documented evidence** of HBV transmission through sweat alone in everyday contact or sports [^111iGUCV]. Rare sports-related clusters involved blood exposure, not sweat [^112ysKnK]. Occupational transmission in healthcare is linked to blood or body fluid exposure, not sweat [^115GzRfs].

---

## Comparison with other body fluids

HBV is **highly concentrated in blood and semen**, making these fluids major transmission sources [^117CpQMP]. Saliva contains lower HBV levels and is not a significant route unless mixed with blood [^1151651L]. Sweat contains minimal HBV and is not considered infectious under normal conditions [^114fqw85].

---

## Preventive measures and precautions

- **Vaccination**: Hepatitis B vaccination is the most effective prevention and is recommended for all infants, healthcare workers, and high-risk adults [^113tL6Wx].

- **Standard precautions**: Use gloves and proper hygiene when handling blood or visibly contaminated fluids [^114j4Jdx].

- **Wound care**: Cover open wounds and avoid contact with others' blood or body fluids [^111FwPdF].

- **Education**: Inform individuals about HBV transmission and prevention [^112CVuiq].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Hepatitis B is **not transmitted through sweat under normal circumstances** [^114fqw85]. The risk is negligible unless sweat is visibly contaminated with blood and enters broken skin or mucous membranes [^114fqw85]. Vaccination and standard precautions are the key preventive strategies [^114j4Jdx].

Virus Description and Transmission

HBV is a 40–42-nm enveloped virus classified in the Hepadnaviridae family. HBV contains a circular, partially double-stranded DNA genome that is 3.2 kb in length. After a susceptible person is exposed, the virus enters the liver via the bloodstream. The liver is the primary site of HBV replication.

HBV has been classified by two separate systems: serologic subtype and genotype. Nine serologic subtypes initially were described based on the heterogeneity of HBsAg: adrq+, adrq–, ayr, ayw1, ayw2, ayw3, ayw4, adw2, and adw4. Ten HBV genotypes, designated A–J, have been described. HBV serotypes and genotypes vary geographically. Infection or immunization with one genotype generally confers immunity to all genotypes.

HBV is highly infectious, can be transmitted in the absence of visible blood, and remains infectious on environmental surfaces for at least 7 days. All HBsAg-positive persons are infectious, but those with elevated HBV DNA or those with hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg), a protein from the hepatitis B virus that circulates in the blood and is a marker of infectivity, are most infectious. Persons with occult HBV infection (i.e. those who test negative for HBsAg but have detectable HBV DNA) also might transmit infection.

HBV is transmitted through percutaneous, mucosal, or nonintact skin exposure to infectious blood or body fluids. HBV is concentrated most highly in blood, and percutaneous exposure is an efficient mode of transmission. Semen and vaginal secretions are infectious, and HBV also can be detected in saliva, tears, and bile. Cerebrospinal fluid, synovial fluid, pleural fluid, peritoneal fluid, pericardial fluid, and amniotic fluid are also considered potentially infectious. Urine, feces, vomitus, nasopharyngeal washings, sputum, and sweat are not efficient vehicles of transmission unless they contain blood because they contain low quantities of infectious HBV. HBsAg found in breast milk is also unlikely to lead to transmission, and hence HBV infection is not a contraindication to breastfeeding.

Also, MTC transmission of HIV and HBV is a major transmission route and can occur during childbirth or breastfeeding. The risk of HIV transmission to the infant is about 25% at the delivery and up to an estimated 40% due to prolonged (18–24 months) breastfeeding in untreated HIV infection and in the absence of interventions 16. For HCV, MTC infection was reported in only about 5–10% of deliveries 17. The role of breastfeeding for perinatal HCV transmission is thought to be negligible, even though some studies have reported HCV RNA in breast milk and colostrum samples from infected women 18. In case of HBV, viral DNA can be detected in the breastmilk 19, but several studies suggest that breastfeeding does not add risk to MTC 20. Furthermore, all infants born to HBV‐infected mothers should receive hepatitis B immune globulin and the first dose of hepatitis B vaccine within 12 h after birth.

Other body fluids like tears, saliva and sweat could additionally harbour the risk of transmitting blood‐borne viruses. HIV as well as HCV RNA has been detected in different body fluids, including saliva; nevertheless, direct transmission via this route has never been shown 21, 22. This is in contrast to HBV, where viral DNA has been detected in tears, saliva and sweat of infected patients, and virus isolated from tear specimens of a patient have been shown to be infective in vivo, indicating a potential risk that body fluids can serve as a vehicle for HBV transmission 23. Occupational exposure to blood‐borne viruses also poses a serious risk for instance to health care workers, and although safety precautions have been introduced, occupational modes of transmission will continue to occur. These include percutaneous or mucosal exposure to blood or body fluids of infected individuals as well as needlestick or other sharp injuries with transmission risks of approximately 30% for HBV, 2% for HCV and 0.3% for HIV 24, 25, 26.

### What can be done about hepatitis B? [^115pVvjx]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2006). Low credibility.

Hepatitis B is an important global problem. Around 350 million people worldwide are chronically infected with hepatitis B virus and are therefore at risk of developing chronic liver disease. This includes around 180,000 people in the UK. Infected patients will be concerned about the social and occupational implications of the diagnosis, the risks of long-term complications, and the possibility of transmission. Some healthcare professionals may be unsure about the value of drug treatments for hepatitis B and the role of vaccination. Here we review key aspects of hepatitis B infection, focusing on what can be done to prevent transmission and treat people with the infection.

### Universal pandemic precautions-an idea ripe for the times [^114j4Jdx]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2020). Medium credibility.

In the early 1980s, the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) epidemic in the United States led to a paradigm shift in infection prevention. Published papers reported that healthcare personnel (HCP) were at risk for acquisition of HIV and hepatitis B virus (HBV) via percutaneous, mucous membrane, or non-intact skin exposure. The number of acute HBV infections among healthcare personnel (HCP) was estimated as 17,000 infections in 1983. In the United States, 58 confirmed and 150 possible cases of occupationally acquired HIV infection were reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) between 1985 and 2013. The threat of bloodborne pathogens to HCP led to institution of universal precautions (now called standard precautions), which recommend that HCP wear gloves for anticipated contact with all body fluids except sweat. Implementation of standard precautions plus pre-exposure hepatitis B vaccine, postexposure prophylaxis for HIV and HBV, and engineering controls (eg, blunted suture needles, self-sheathing needles, needleless connectors, etc) have dramatically reduced the risks for HIV and HBV acquisition by HCP. Since 1999, only 1 confirmed case of HIV (a laboratory technician who sustained a needle puncture while working with a live HIV culture in 2008) has been reported. The rate of HBV infections among HCP decreased ~98% from 1983 to 2010. Although some initial pushback occurred with the implementation of standard precautions due to concern that routine wearing of gloves would be poorly received by patients and impair the ability to perform procedures such as placing intravenous catheters, they are routinely practiced and accepted today.

Similarly, the threat proffered by the sudden appearance of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the healthcare workplace resulted in the implementation of risk mitigation strategies that may also produce permanent behavioral modification in the healthcare setting. As it also occurred during the 1980s with the HIV/AIDS epidemic, the introduction of a new disease and new risks into the healthcare setting should result in long-lasting changes in patient care that at least offer potential for increased patient and staff safety.

What is the Transmission Route of HBV?

Today, we know that HBVs are highly infectious and are spread by exposure of mucosal membranes or nonintact skin to infected blood or other body fluids (saliva, semen, and vaginal fluid). In high endemic areas, HBV is most commonly transmitted from mother to child at birth (perinatal transmission) and during early childhood from infected to uninfected children (horizontal transmission). Most HBV infections in areas of low endemicity occur in adults in relatively well-defined risk groups, such as those at risk through sexual exposure, household members of an infected person, hemodialysis patients, incarcerated persons, injection-drug users, persons at risk for occupational exposure, developmentally disabled persons in long-term care facilities, and travelers to regions with moderate or high HBV endemicity. Today, only humans are a known reservoir for human HBV genotypes, but closely related HBV genotypes exist in higher primates [23]. Hence, a comprehensive control strategy could eventually lead to the eradication of HBV.

How is Hepatitis B Diagnosed?

Because clinical manifestations of hepatitis B are indistinguishable from other causes of viral hepatitis, a definitive diagnosis requires serological testing [24]. This testing uses different (combinations of) serologic markers to identify different phases of HBV infection and to conclude whether a person has acute or chronic HBV infection, or is immune to HBV as a result of prior HBV infection or vaccination, or is susceptible to infection. In Table 1 an interpretation of hepatitis B serologic test results is given.

Table 1.
Interpretation of Serologic Test Results for Hepatitis B

Chronic infection is arbitrarily defined by the persistence of HBsAg (with or without concurrent HBeAg) in serum for at least 6 months. Anti-HBs are neutralizing antibodies and their presence in serum confers long-term immunity against HBV infection. In persons with acquired immunity through vaccination, anti-HBs is the only serological marker detected. In contrast to persons with a past HBV infection where anti-HBs are present concurrently with anti-HBc IgG.

During the initial, highly replicative phase of HBV infection patients are also seropositive for HBeAg, of whom some remain HBeAg positive for years. All HBsAg-positive persons should be considered infectious; however, the presence of HBeAg indicates that the blood and body fluids of the infected individual are highly contagious (ie, HBV DNA levels of 10 7 to 10 9 IU/mL). Although HBsAg has been detected in multiple body fluids, only serum, saliva, semen, and vaginal fluid have been demonstrated to be infectious [25].

### Risk of hepatitis B infections in olympic wrestling [^111MSjdR]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

First, to investigate the prevalence of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) and occult HBV infection (OC-HBV) in Turkish Olympic wrestlers. Second, to examine the relationship between HBV DNA values in sweat and blood.

Methods

A total of 70 male Olympic wrestlers were recruited as the study sample.

Results

As a result of the standard monoclonal antibody based hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) detection, none of the Olympic wrestlers carried HBsAg in this study. On the other hand, according to real time PCR for serum HBV DNA detection in this study, 9 (13%) of the wrestlers had OC-HBV infection. Eight (11%) of the participants had HBV DNA in their sweat. In addition, there was a significant relationship between HBV DNA values in the blood and sweat of the wrestlers (r = 0.52, p < 0.01).

Conclusions

In addition to bleeding wounds and mucous membranes, sweating may be another way of transmitting HBV infections in contact sports. An HBV test should be done and each wrestler should be vaccinated at the start of his career.

### Prevention of hepatitis B virus infection in the United States: recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices [^115Lgynu]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Postexposure Prophylaxis

This section provides recommendations for management of persons who are exposed to HBV through a distinct, identifiable exposure to blood or body fluids that contain blood, in occupational and nonoccupational settings.

Wounds and skin sites that have been in contact with blood or body fluids should be washed with soap and water; mucous membranes should be flushed with water. Using antiseptics (e.g. 2%–4% chlorhexidine) for wound care or expressing fluid by squeezing the wound further have not been shown to reduce the risk for HBV transmission; however, the use of antiseptics is not contraindicated. The application of caustic agents (e.g. bleach) or the injection of antiseptics or disinfectants into the wound is not recommended.

### Commentary: a review of risk of hepatitis B and C transmission through biting or spitting [^1151651L]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2018). Low credibility.

A draft UK Parliamentary Bill sought to criminalize assaults on emergency workers through biting and spitting. This seemed to be based on a fear of bloodborne virus transmission. We undertook a literature search to clarify the risk of hepatitis infection from such exposures. We identified 245 possible papers and then reduced these to those relevant to HBV and HCV transmission through biting or spitting and the scientific plausibility. Nine papers were identified, reporting 16 possible cases of HBV (15 bites, 1 spitting) and 2 of HCV transmission (both bites). Only 3 HBV transmissions by bites and 1 by spitting and both HCV transmissions were felt to be plausible. Although both HBV DNA and HCV RNA can be found in the saliva of infected patients, it seems unlikely that there is enough to transmit infection unless there is blood contamination. In conclusion, the risk of acquiring HCV through spitting is negligible and is very low for HBV. The risk is also low for acquiring HBV and HCV through biting, especially if no blood is apparent in the saliva.

### Paired, quantitative measurements of hepatitis B virus DNA in saliva, urine and serum of chronic hepatitis B patients [^116gyN1y]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2005). Low credibility.

Objectives

Despite an abundance of epidemiological evidence for horizontal transmission of hepatitis B virus (HBV), the transmission route remains to be fully elucidated. In a new approach, we evaluated quantitative HBV DNA content in serum, saliva and urine as a first step in exploring possible modes of horizontal transmission.

Methods

In an outpatient setting of an academic hospital, paired serum, saliva and urine samples were collected from 150 chronically infected HBV patients. A validated HBV DNA TaqMan assay was used to quantitatively measure HBV DNA.

Results

Mean log HBV DNA in serum was 5.8 (range, undetectable to 10.0 log HBV DNA) copies/ml, 50% of the patients had an HBV DNA above 10 copies/ml in serum. Mean log HBV DNA level in saliva was 3.2 (range, undetectable to 7.5) copies/ml, 15% had an HBV DNA above 10 copies/ml in saliva. Mean log HBV DNA level in urine was 2.6 (range, undetectable to 5.4) copies/ml and 1% had an HBV DNA above 10 copies/ml in urine. A high, non-linear correlation was shown between HBV DNA in serum and saliva (Spearman's rho 0.82) and between serum and urine (Spearman's rho 0.74).

Conclusions

The significant amounts of HBV DNA found in saliva and urine in chronic HBV patients with high viraemia in serum may have implications for the understanding of hepatitis B epidemiology. The potential infectivity of these body fluids may provide an explanation for the 20% of cases of infection obtained through horizontal transmission for which the origin of infection is yet unknown.

AASLD/IDSA chronic hepatitis B — non-pharmacologic prevention: Non-pharmacologic measures are the mainstay of HBV prevention, with HBV vaccination the primary intervention to prevent HBV transmission to susceptible individuals in all settings, including those with a known higher risk of exposure; screening for HBV infection in all people, including those potentially exposed to an individual who is HBsAg positive with viremia, household contacts and sex partners, is strongly recommended by the CDC and U.S. Preventive Services Task Force guidelines, and other important risk mitigators include universal precautions in healthcare and first aid settings, harm reduction, and barrier methods during sex. The page also states that HBV is not transmitted from casual contact, and people with hepatitis B should not be restricted in their daily activities, contact sports, school activities or professional training.

### Patient and public health perspectives to inform expansion of hepatitis B treatment guidelines [^117TEmgN]. The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

No amount of information and caution can cover every possible exposure event, and the affected community should not be expected to abstain from all activities that could potentially lead to transmission. There may be activities that depend on a large range of factors as to its risk of transmission but for which data are very poor (e.g. contact sports, minor injuries, wet shaving using a razor). Treatment access, for people seeking it, would provide an extra layer of prevention in horizontal transmission and allow the affected community to participate in life with less fear.

We can learn from the HIV community and the tremendous progress made towards reducing both transmission and stigma. Some countries have been able to significantly reduce new HIV infections by implementing a combination of primary prevention including pre-exposure prophylaxis PrEP and expanding access to antiviral treatment. We can also learn from the power of the "Undetectable = Untransmittable" (U = U) paradigm, which was integral to the reduction of stigma and discrimination for HIV. This messaging states that when a person living with HIV maintains an undetectable viral load due to antiviral suppression, they cannot transmit the virus via sexual contact. The hepatitis B field could similarly adopt a properly qualified message similar to U = U. Current guidelines for the management of infected healthcare providers accept that there is a negligible risk of transmitting HBV due to exposure to biological fluids during an invasive surgical procedure if the provider has an undetectable viral load. Despite scant studies showing this, it is highly likely that U = U largely holds for HBV transmission during sexual contact. Evidence for this will be difficult to collect due to the ethical obligation to offer vaccination to partners of PLWHB.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for hepatitis B virus infection, more specifically with respect to indications for screening, population at risk, WHO 2024 guidelines recommend to screen for HBV infection with HBsAg serological testing (with linkage to care and treatment services) in the following individuals in all settings, regardless of whether testing is delivered through facility- or community-based testing:

- adults and adolescents from populations most affected by HBV infection (either part of a population with high HBV seroprevalence or having a history of exposure and/or high-risk behavior for HBV infection)

- adults, adolescents, and children with a clinical suspicion of chronic viral hepatitis, identified by symptoms, signs, or laboratory markers

- sexual partners, children and other family members, and close household contacts of patients with HBV infection

- all healthcare workers who have not been vaccinated previously.

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) are the most prevalent bloodborne pathogens. Infections caused by these organisms can become chronic and may lead to liver cirrhosis and carcinoma. Limited chemotherapy is now available, but only HBV can be prevented through vaccination. Both viruses are enveloped and relatively sensitive to many physical and chemical agents; their ability to survive in the environment may not be as high as often believed. As a result, their spread occurs mainly through direct parenteral or percutaneous exposure to tainted body fluids and tissues. Careful screening of and avoiding contact with such materials remain the most effective means of protection. Nevertheless, the indirect spread of these viruses, although much less common, can occur when objects that are freshly contaminated with tainted blood enter the body or contact damaged skin. Germicidal chemicals are important in the prevention of HBV and HCV spread through shared injection devices, sharps used in personal services (such as tattooing and body piercing), and heat-sensitive medical/dental devices (such as flexible endoscopes) and in the cleanup of blood spills. Microbicides in vaginal gels may also interrupt their transmission. General-purpose environmental disinfection is unlikely to play a significant role in the prevention of the transmission of these viruses. Testing of low-level disinfectants and label claims for such products against HBV and HCV should be discouraged. Both viruses remain difficult to work with in the laboratory, but closely related animal viruses (such as the duck HBV) and the bovine viral diarrhea virus show considerable promise as surrogates for HBV and HCV, respectively. Although progress in the culturing of HBV and HCV is still underway, critical issues on virus survival and inactivation should be addressed with the use of these surrogates.

### Screening recommendations for hepatitis B virus infection [^113Fh9x1]. JAMA Dermatology (2016). Medium credibility.

Clinical Question

What are the screening guidelines for hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection for asymptomatic, nonpregnant adolescents and adults in the United States?

Bottom Line

Patients with a high risk of infection, such as those with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), who use injection drugs, or who live in a household where someone is infected with HBV; men who have sex with men; or patients who come from countries with a high prevalence of HBV infection, should be screened.

For exposures from an HCP with HIV, "even if the viral load is undetectable, this plan should include notifying the patient about the exposure and offering postexposure chemoprophylaxis, following current postexposure prophylaxis recommendations", and "if the HCP has an undetectable viral load, in which case the risk for transmission is likely vanishingly small, postexposure prophylaxis should be administered out of an abundance of caution". The guideline adds that "HCP who had HCV and who have been treated with DAA and are cured present no risk for transmission", and "Management of potential hepatitis B or hepatitis C exposures should follow current CDC recommendations.5,10"

### Does cerumen have a risk for transmission of hepatitis B? [^114dDqnK]. The Laryngoscope (2004). Low credibility.

Objectives/Hypothesis

Chronic hepatitis B virus infection is a significant worldwide health problem. It affects 350 to 400 million people. The patients with chronic hepatitis B virus infection have a significant risk for the development of cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma. Full awareness of the mechanisms of transmission can allows susceptible individuals to refrain from this infection. Cerumen has never been studied as a route for hepatitis B transmission. The aim of the study was evaluate the importance of cerumen in transmission of hepatitis B virus infection.

Study Design

This study was performed on forty patients with confirmed hepatitis B virus infection.

Methods

Forty cerumen specimens collected from the patients with hepatitis B virus DNA in their sera were prospectively analyzed for the presence of hepatitis B virus DNA by real-time polymerase chain reaction.

Results

Eleven of 40 cerumen specimens (27.5%) were positive for hepatitis B virus DNA, with counts ranging from 4.2 x 10 to 4.7 x 10 copies per sample. There was positive correlation between hepatitis B virus DNA concentrations of serum and cerumen. Half of hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-positive patients had detectable hepatitis B virus DNA levels (5.7 x 10 to 4.7 x 10 copies) in cerumen specimens, whereas 12.5% of cerumen specimens from anti-HBe-positive patients had hepatitis B virus DNA levels (4.2 x 10 to 7.0 x 10 copies).

Conclusion

Cerumen can be a potential source of transmission. Therefore, this route should be investigated in further studies for horizontal, nosocomial, and occupational transmission of hepatitis B.

### Hepatitis C virus replicates in sweat glands and is released into sweat in patients with chronic hepatitis C [^112X6inF]. Journal of Medical Virology (2002). Low credibility.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) replicates in salivary glands of chronic hepatitis C patients and is released into the saliva, suggesting that HCV may replicate in other exocrine glands. The presence of positive and negative HCV RNA strands was demonstrated by in situ hybridization, and of HCV core protein by immunohistochemistry, in sweat glands and keratinocytes in healthy skin biopsies from 15 patients with chronic hepatitis C and 10 anti-HCV negative patients with chronic liver disease. Positive and negative HCV RNA strands were detected in 9.6 ± 5.2% and 4.2 ± 3.8%, respectively, of the epithelial cells of eccrine sweat glands. Core protein was detected in 6.0 ± 3.93% of these cells. HCV RNA resistant to RNase digestion (encapsidated HCV RNA) was detected in 10/10 sweat samples from HCV-infected patients. Positive and negative HCV RNA strands were detected in 6.7 ± 2.97% and 3.0 ± 3.08% of the keratinocytes, respectively. HCV core protein was found in 4.5 ± 2.76% of these cells. No HCV RNA or HCV core protein was detected in the skin biopsies from the 10 anti-HCV negative patients. In conclusion, HCV replicates in eccrine sweat glands cells and keratinocytes in healthy skin and is released into the sweat.

### Parvoviruses PARV4 / 5 in hepatitis C virus-infected patient [^115H67ye]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

To the Editor: Parvoviruses are small, nonenveloped DNA viruses that infect both vertebrate and invertebrate hosts. Until recently, parvovirus B19 and adeno-associated viruses, which belong to the genera Erythrovirus and Dependovirus, respectively, were the only known members of the family Parvoviridae that infected humans. However, 2 recent publications have identified 2 distinct, novel parvoviruses in humans by using the DNase sequence–independent single-primer amplification technique and a related method. The first of these viruses, termed PARV4, was observed in a patient with symptoms of acute viral infection syndrome after high-risk behavior for infection with HIV-1, although the patient was subsequently confirmed as negative for HIV-1. The second parvovirus was identified in respiratory samples from children with lower respiratory tract infections and termed human bocavirus.

Parvovirus B19 is a frequent contaminant of plasma pools that are used in the manufacture of blood products, which results in high viral loads in pools and viral transmission in recipients of clotting factors. We identified PARV4 in such pools, albeit at a lower frequency and titer than parvovirus B19, when parvovirus B19 was not excluded by screening with nucleic acid amplification techniques. Sequence analysis identified a second genotype of PARV4, which we have termed PARV5, that shares ≈92% nucleotide identity with PARV4.

PARV4 was originally identified in a plasma sample from a homeless, injection drug user with fatigue, night sweats, pharyngitis, neck stiffness, vomiting, diarrhea, arthralgia, and confusion. This person was coinfected with hepatitis B virus. In this study, we looked retrospectively for PARV4 and PARV5 in blood samples from a similar cohort of persons, many of whom were known to be infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) (as determined by the presence of both HCV RNA and antibodies to HCV), and some of whom were intravenous drug users (IVDUs).

### Risk of hepatitis B virus transmission via dental handpieces and evaluation of an anti-suction device for prevention of transmission [^116AWHNT]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2007). Low credibility.

We evaluated the risk of hepatitis B virus (HBV) transmission via dental handpieces and the effects of an anti-suction device in preventing HBV contamination. The results of our study show that under certain conditions, HBV transmission can occur when an anti-suction device is used during dental procedures. We conclude that such devices may decrease contamination, but do not eliminate it.

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) transmission precautions and vaccination response — Within households, worksites, and other settings, it is important to emphasize that routine contact, sharing meals, hugging are not considered routes of transmission, though sharing of personal hygiene items (e.g. toothbrush, razors) should be avoided. Groups known to have inadequate response to vaccine include persons with immunocompromising conditions, persons with diabetes, persons with advanced liver disease, persons with advanced kidney disease, persons who smoke and obese individuals. For health care providers performing Category III procedures, the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA) guidelines suggest maintaining HBV DNA < 1000 IU/mL.

### Hepatitis B [^111RHmR6]. IDSA (2009). Medium credibility.

Hepatitis B transmission and chronicity risk — HBV is transmitted by perinatal, percutaneous, and sexual exposure, as well as by close person-to-person contact, and HBV can survive outside the body for prolonged periods. The risk of developing chronic HBV infection after acute exposure ranges from 90% in newborns of HBeAg-positive mothers to 25% to 30% in infants and children under 5 and no less than 5% in adults, and immunosuppressed persons are more likely to develop chronic infection after acute infection. In settings such as the United States, the risk of transmitting HBV in daycare centers or schools is extremely low and HBsAg-positive children should not be isolated or prevented from participating in activities including sports. For screening, tests should include HBsAg and hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs), and hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc) can be utilized as long as those who test positive are further tested for both HBsAg and anti-HBs to differentiate infection from immunity.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^117CpQMP]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Hepatitis B Virus Infection

The incubation period for HBV infection from time of exposure to symptom onset ranges from 6 weeks to 6 months. The highest concentrations of HBV are located in blood, with lower concentrations in other body fluids including wound exudates, semen, vaginal secretions, and saliva. HBV is more infectious and more stable in the environment than other bloodborne pathogens (e.g. HCV or HIV).

HBV infection can be either self-limited or chronic. Among adults, approximately half of newly acquired HBV infections are symptomatic, and approximately 1% of reported cases result in acute liver failure and death. Risk for chronic infection is inversely related to age at acquisition; approximately 90% of infected infants and 30% of infected children aged < 5 years become chronically infected, compared with 2%–6% of persons who become infected as adults. Among persons with chronic HBV infection, the risk for premature death from cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma is 15%–25%.

HBV is efficiently transmitted by percutaneous or mucous membrane exposure to HBV-infected blood or body fluids that contain HBV. The primary risk factors associated with infection among adolescents and adults are unprotected sex with an infected partner, having multiple partners, men having sex with men, having history of other STIs, and injecting drug use. In addition, studies have demonstrated other modes of HBV transmission, including premastication and lapses in health care infection control procedures, as less common sources of transmission.

CDC's national strategy for eliminating transmission of HBV infection includes prevention of perinatal infection through routine screening of all pregnant women for HBsAg and immunoprophylaxis of infants born to mothers with HBsAg or mothers whose HBsAg status is unknown, routine infant vaccination, vaccination of previously unvaccinated children and adolescents through age 18 years, and vaccination of previously unvaccinated adults at increased risk for infection. High vaccination coverage rates with subsequent decreases in acute HBV infection incidence have been achieved among infants and adolescents. The vaccination of persons as children and adolescents likely has led to improved vaccination coverage among adults aged < 30 years and corresponding lower rates of acute HBV infection among this group. In contrast, vaccination coverage among the majority of adult populations at high risk aged ≥ 30 years (e.g. persons with multiple sex partners, MSM, and injecting drug users) has remained low; these groups account for the highest rates of preventable acute infections. STD clinics and other health care settings providing STI services to adults at high risk for infection should administer hepatitis B vaccine to those who are unvaccinated.

### Screening and testing for hepatitis B virus infection: CDC recommendations-United States, 2023 [^116GQicJ]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Rationale for New Recommendations

Chronic HBV infection can lead to substantial morbidity and mortality but is detectable before the development of severe liver disease using reliable and inexpensive screening tests. Routine monitoring and treatment for chronic HBV infection can reduce morbidity and mortality, supporting the importance of early detection of HBV infection. In addition, although not quantifiable, management of chronic infection through prevention efforts can prevent further transmission to others. These recommendations consider a simpler and less stigmatizing implementation strategy than previous risk-based HBV screening recommendations. The recommendations also provide guidance that is complementary to the 2022 ACIP recommendations to vaccinate all adults aged 19–59 years against HBV infection by providing a means to establish immunity or any history of infection or the need for vaccination to protect from future infection. Specific rationales for recommendations are as follows:

### Analysis of hepatitis B virus in the cerumen and otorrhea of chronic HBV-infected patients: is there a hepatitis B virus infectivity? [^111jVLK6]. Otology & Neurotology (2008). Low credibility.

Hypothesis

The object of this study was to find out whether cerumen and otorrhea have any infectivity in the transmission of hepatitis B virus (HBV).

Background

The HBV infection is a worldwide health problem. It can be transmitted by infected blood or other body fluids through percutaneous or permucosal exposure. Recently, there have been some reports where cerumen can be a potential source of HBV transmission.

Methods

This study was performed on 30 chronic hepatitis B patients who tested positive in hepatitis B surface antigen (HBs Ag). Thirty cerumen and 5 otorrhea samples were analyzed. The cerumen and the serum were examined for (HBs Ag) and hepatitis B e antigen (HBe Ag) by using enzyme immunoassay systems. As for HBV DNA detection, quantitative polymerase chain reaction was performed on the serum, cerumen, and otorrhea.

Results

Hepatitis B virus DNA was detected in the 20 samples of cerumen (66.7%) and all 5 otorrhea (100%) from 30 patients. The mean values of HBV DNA in cerumen and otorrhea were significantly lower than serum. Hepatitis B virus DNA and HBs Ag were detected with significantly higher rates in the cerumen of patients who are serum HBe Ag positive than negative. However, positive HBe Ag, which implies that it is associated with the increased risk of disease progression and infectivity, was not detected in any of cerumen samples.

Conclusion

The cerumen and otorrhea of chronic hepatitis B patients have a low risk of infectivity.

### SHEA practice update: infection prevention and control (IPC) in residential facilities for pediatric patients and their families [^114PdRd1]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Hepatitis B virus

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) can cause acute and chronic liver disease. Some patients may appear healthy, but others may be ill with nausea, vomiting, jaundice (yellowing of the skin), or severe liver disease. Chronic infections may lead to cirrhosis (scarring of the liver), liver failure, and cancer.

HBV spreads by infected blood or body fluids. Transmission from an infected individual can occur by transfusion of blood that has not been screened for HBV, sharing or using non-sterile needles, syringes or glucose monitoring devices, needle stick injuries, and sexual contact with an infected person or household exposure to a person with chronic HBV. HBV can also be spread from mother to infant during pregnancy or at the time of birth. Transmission of HBV infection in childcare settings has been described but occurs rarely. Such transmission is most likely to occur through direct contact with blood from an infected person after an injury or from bites or scratches that break the skin. Vaccination provides long-term protection against hepatitis B virus infection. Hepatitis B vaccination is recommended for all infants in the United States; the first dose is given at the time of birth or before being discharged from the nursery.

Hepatitis C virus

Like HBV, hepatitis C virus (HCV) also causes acute and chronic liver disease. Chronic HCV infections may lead to liver failure and cancer. Individuals who are infected with HCV may feel well and not know they are infected.

HCV spreads through infected blood or body fluids. The most common risk factors are sharing or using non-sterile needles, and male-to-male sexual contact. HCV can also be spread from mother to infant, and rarely, by household contact. The transmission risks of HCV infection in childcare settings are unknown, but are likely to be extremely low. Currently, there is no vaccine available to protect against HCV infection, but there are effective antiviral treatments.

Human immunodeficiency virus

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) causes an infection that attacks the immune system and has a variety of symptoms. In its advanced stage, it causes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), which is associated with increased risk for many life-threatening infections. Transmission of HIV only occurs by contact with blood or certain body fluids (e.g. semen, vaginal secretions, and human milk). Transmission does not occur by casual contact and has not been documented in settings such as school or childcare.

Currently, there is no vaccine to protect against HIV infection, but there are effective medications that greatly reduce the risk of transmission from person-to-person.

### A novel sweat sensor detects inflammatory differential rhythmicity patterns in inpatients and outpatients with cirrhosis [^111weuvr]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Serum IL6 is associated with poor outcomes in patients with cirrhosis using blood levels in prior studies. However, those studies have largely focused on blood levels at discrete timepoints without focusing on variations in levels over time. Cirrhosis is a disease of chronic inflammation requiring frequent hospitalizations and numerous studies have looked at serum biomarkers as predictors of inflammation and decompensation. We chose sweat CRP, IL6, and TNFα as the target cytokines in this study based on previous research of serum studies linking these biomarkers to important clinical outcomes. Perdigoto et al.showed that serum CRP can predict infections in a prospective cohort of inpatients with cirrhosis. A recent meta-analysis documented serum IL6 may discriminant bacterial infections and predict hepatic encephalopathy in subjects with cirrhosis, TNFα also elevated in decompensated cirrhosis and correlates with the severity of ACLF, although a clinical trial of anti-TNFα therapy did not show a benefit in patients with ACLF due to increased secondary infections. However, the unique patterns of cytokines throughout the day in decompensated and more advanced patients compared to healthy people and outpatients could be more important in monitoring patients over time than one-time blood draws. This was found using complementary analysis of rhythmicity change (Circacompare) and relative change in cytokines compared to control values in specific cohorts (Hedge's G). We did not show significant differences in infected or uninfected patients using both approaches likely due to the relatively small sample size and the time period that spanned days after adequate antibiotic therapy. This follows the differential rhythms in these cytokine levels and extends them into compensated and decompensated cirrhosis patients.

### An evidence-based practical guide to vaccination for hepatitis B virus [^113LmWRR]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

The hepatitis B virus (HBV) is highly infectious, with over 292 million chronically infected people worldwide and up to 2.4 million in the United States. Following infection, clinically silent liver damage can ensue, but symptoms or signs of advanced disease, including cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, can take decades to emerge. HBV has the heaviest public health burden of all hepatitis viruses and has now surpassed other major communicable diseases (eg, HIV, diarrheal disease, malaria, tuberculosis) as a leading cause of death globally. Preventing transmission is essential, and efforts are in place to reinforce screening, vaccination, and routine follow-up. Three safe and effective vaccines are available in the United States and other countries for HBV prevention, and the benefits of vaccination in preventing infection and its sequelae have been substantiated. For the first time in over 25 years, a new Food and Drug Administration-approved vaccine is available that offers a high degree of immunogenicity after 2, rather than 3, injections. Persistent challenges include the underutilization of vaccination, choice of vaccine, incomplete vaccinations, varying needs in different populations, management of nonresponders or those with undocumented or incompletely documented vaccination courses, and questions about whether and when booster injections may be needed. A panel of US academic hepatologists with expertise and experience in preventing and managing HBV infection have collaborated to write this practical clinical paper intended to guide clinicians in vaccinating for HBV and address questions that regularly arise in the clinic.

### Occupational deaths among healthcare workers [^112uLwZe]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Hepatitis B

CDC estimates that, in 1983, 10,000 healthcare workers became infected with hepatitis B through occupational exposure (M.J. Alter, pers. comm.). The natural history of hepatitis B infection indicates that chronic infection developed in 5%–10% (500–1,000) of these persons. Although estimates vary, as many as 15%–25% (75–250 persons) of those with chronic infection will die from a hepatitis B–related complication, including cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma. Since the time from infection to serious medical disease in the subset with these complications typically is about 20 years, most of these deaths can be expected to occur during this decade.

The risk of hepatitis B has diminished by > 90% since the introduction of standard precautions and a recombinant vaccine. Despite vaccine availability, however, coverage is incomplete because > 30% of workers refuse to be vaccinated. As a consequence, CDC estimates that, in 2002, another 400 healthcare workers became infected with hepatitis B virus, a number that has been stable since 1995 (M.J. Alter, pers. comm.).

Additionally, several procedural and technological interventions (eg, blunt-tipped suture needles, needleless connectors, self-sheathing needles) were designed to decrease risk for occupational exposures and are likely to have decreased the frequency of any occupational exposure.

Oversight panels for HCP living with a bloodborne pathogen — composition and confidentiality requirements are specified by prior guidance and SHEA extensions: The 1991 CDC guidelines stated that the review panel should include experts representing a balanced perspective, including the HCW's personal physician(s), an infectious disease specialist with expertise in the epidemiology of HIV and HBV transmission, a physician with expertise in the procedures being performed, and a state or local public health official(s); if institutionally based, an infection control committee member (preferably a healthcare epidemiologist) may be included, and panels must recognize the importance of confidentiality and the privacy rights of infected HCWs. The 2010 SHEA guidance extended these recommendations, stating the review panel should include, but not necessarily be limited to, individuals with expertise in the HCP's specialty or subspecialty, Healthcare Epidemiology, Infectious Diseases or Hepatology, Occupational Medicine, and/or hospital administration, as well as the infected HCP's physician, a public health official (where managed at the state level), a human resources professional, and perhaps an individual with legal and/or ethics expertise.

Blood‐borne viruses

Blood‐borne viruses consist of a group of viruses spread via body fluids, most commonly blood and genital tract secretions, although other body fluids can transmit virus too. The most well‐known and prevalent of these are human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis B and C viruses (HBV and HCV respectively). Diagnosis of these infections is usually by serology in the first instance, with polymerase chain reaction assays for viral nucleic acids to look for active viral replication or as the primary test in immunocompromised patients who may not seroconvert.

### Hepatitis B virus infection [^114xdnBN]. Lancet (2014). Excellent credibility.

Hepatitis B virus infection is a major public health problem worldwide; roughly 30% of the world's population show serological evidence of current or past infection. Hepatitis B virus is a partly double-stranded DNA virus with several serological markers: HBsAg and anti-HBs, HBeAg and anti-HBe, and anti-HBc IgM and IgG. It is transmitted through contact with infected blood and semen. A safe and effective vaccine has been available since 1981, and, although variable, the implementation of universal vaccination in infants has resulted in a sharp decline in prevalence. Hepatitis B virus is not cytopathic; both liver damage and viral control — and therefore clinical outcome — depend on the complex interplay between virus replication and host immune response. Overall, as much as 40% of men and 15% of women with perinatally acquired hepatitis B virus infection will die of liver cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma. In addition to decreasing hepatic inflammation, long-term antiviral treatment can reverse cirrhosis and reduce hepatocellular carcinoma. Development of new therapies that can improve HBsAg clearance and virological cure is warranted.

Case presentation

A 75-year-old female (height 1.56 m, weight 44 kg) with a history of hepatitis B infection was admitted to Sichuan Mianyang 404 Hospital (Sichuan Province, China) in October 2022 due to a one-week period of black stool. Upon physical examination, the patient was fully alert and vital signs were within normal ranges (body temperature, 36.7 °C; heart rate, 91 bpm; respiration rate, 20 per min; blood pressure, 143/75 mmHg). The diagnosis at admission was gastrointestinal haemorrhage, decompensated cirrhosis following hepatitis B infection, and hypersplenism. On October 24, 2022, electronic gastroscopy was performed, and dyclonine hydrochloride mucilage (Yangtze River Pharmaceutical Group, Jiangsu, China; lot number: 22,121,511, specification: 0.1 g in 10 mL) was administered orally at 17:00. At 17:06, the patient experienced abrupt cognitive impairment, limb weakness, and profuse sweating, but there were no marked changes in heart rate (90 bpm), respiration rate (19 times per min), or blood pressure (148/76 mmHg). Physical examination during the event revealed coma and loss of muscle strength in the limbs but no obvious pathological symptoms. Further, electrocardiography revealed no abnormalities in cardiac waveforms (Fig. 1), while blood sugar was high-normal (10.5 mmol/L).

### Symptom prevalence and clustering of symptoms in people living with chronic hepatitis C infection [^1124wAWv]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2006). Low credibility.

Quality of life has been shown to be poor among people living with chronic hepatitis C. However, it is not clear how this relates to the presence of symptoms and their severity. The aim of this study was to describe the typology of a broad array of symptoms that were attributed to hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Phase 1 used qualitative methods to identify symptoms. In Phase 2, 188 treatment-naïve people living with HCV participated in a quantitative survey. The most prevalent symptom was physical tiredness (86%) followed by irritability (75%), depression (70%), mental tiredness (70%), and abdominal pain (68%). Temporal clustering of symptoms was reported in 62% of participants. Principal components analysis identified four symptom clusters: neuropsychiatric (mental tiredness, poor concentration, forgetfulness, depression, irritability, physical tiredness, and sleep problems); gastrointestinal (day sweats, nausea, food intolerance, night sweats, abdominal pain, poor appetite, and diarrhea); algesic (joint pain, muscle pain, and general body pain); and dysesthetic (noise sensitivity, light sensitivity, skin problems, and headaches). These data demonstrate that symptoms are prevalent in treatment-naïve people with HCV and support the hypothesis that symptom clustering occurs.

The updated EASL Clinical Practice Guidelines on the management of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection provide comprehensive, evidence-based recommendations for its management. Spanning ten thematic sections, the guidelines address diagnostics, treatment goals, treatment indications, therapeutic options, hepatocellular carcinoma surveillance, management of special populations, HBV reactivation prophylaxis, post-transplant care, HBV prevention strategies, and finally address open questions and future research directions. Chronic HBV remains a global health challenge, with over 250 million individuals affected and significant mortality due to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. These guidelines emphasise the importance of early diagnosis, risk stratification based on viral and host factors, and tailored antiviral therapy. Attention is given to simplified algorithms, vaccination, and screening to support global HBV elimination targets. The guidelines also discuss emerging biomarkers and evolving definitions of functional and partial cure. Developed through literature review, expert consensus, and a Delphi process, the guidelines aim to equip healthcare providers across disciplines with practical tools to optimise HBV care and outcomes worldwide.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^1144Dzqw]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

When seeking medical or dental care, persons who are HBsAg positive should be advised to inform their health care providers of their HBsAg status so that they can be evaluated and managed. The following are key counseling messages for persons with HBsAg:

HBV is not usually spread by hugging, coughing, food or water, sharing eating utensils or drinking glasses, or casual contact.
Persons should not be excluded from work, school, play, childcare, or other settings because they are infected with HBV.
Involvement with a support group might help patients cope with chronic HBV infection.
HBV infection is a chronic condition that can be treated, and patients should receive prevention counseling and be evaluated for antiviral treatment.

Special Considerations

Pregnancy

Regardless of whether they have been previously tested or vaccinated, all pregnant women should be tested for HBsAg at the first prenatal visit and again at delivery if at high risk for HBV infection (see STI Detection Among Special Populations). Pregnant women at risk for HBV infection and without documentation of a complete hepatitis B vaccine series should receive hepatitis B vaccination. All pregnant women with HBsAg should be reported to state and local perinatal hepatitis B prevention programs and referred to a specialist. Information about management of pregnant women with HBsAg and their infants is available at.

HIV Infection

HIV infection can impair the response to hepatitis B vaccination. Persons with HIV should be tested for anti-HBs 1–2 months after the third vaccine dose (see Postvaccination Serologic Testing). Modified dosing regimens, including a doubling of the standard antigen dose and administration of additional doses, might increase the response rate and should be managed in consultation with an infectious disease specialist. Additional recommendations for management of persons with HBsAg and HIV infection are available.

SHEA White Paper — management of healthcare personnel (HCP) living with hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in US healthcare institutions — states that "Only 5 instances of healthcare personnel (HCP)-to-patient transmission of HBV (n = 2), HCV (n = 3), or HIV (n = 0) have occurred since this guideline was published, underscoring the low risk for these events". The introduction highlights therapeutic progress: "Effective antiretroviral therapy can now fully suppress HIV, rendering the person noninfectious to others through sexual contact", and "Antivirals effectively suppress the viral load and slow the progression of HBV, and direct-acting antivirals (DAA) have made HCV a curable disease in almost all patients". Historical policy context is summarized: "In 1991, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published guidelines designed to prevent HCP-to-patient transmission of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)", whereas "In 2012, CDC issued updated recommendations for the management of HCP and students living with HBV", which "controverted the 1991 guidelines (at least for HCP living with HBV), specifically noting, 'There is no clear justification for or benefit from routine notification of the HBV infection status of an HCP to his or her patient with the exception of instances in which an HCP transmits HBV to one or more patients or documented instances in which an HCP exposes a patient to a bloodborne infection'. The paper explains its purpose by noting "the additional 10 years of experience and advances in medical progress necessitate modulation of the recommendations made in the 2010 SHEA guideline".

### Screening and testing for hepatitis B virus infection: CDC recommendations-United States, 2023 [^113Crsvo]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

BOX 2
Rationale for universal hepatitis B virus screening

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection has substantial morbidity and mortality.
Chronic HBV infection can be detected before the development of severe liver disease using reliable and inexpensive screening tests.
Treatment for chronic HBV infection can reduce morbidity and mortality.
Management of chronic HBV infection might prevent transmission to others.
Universal screening of adults is cost-effective.
Screening enables identification and management of pregnant persons infected with HBV and their infants, which can reduce the risk for perinatal transmission.
Screening can identify persons who are at risk for reactivation of HBV infection.
Screening might identify persons who would benefit from hepatitis B vaccination.

A one-time HBV screening of adults would be complementary to the 2022 Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommendation to vaccinate all adults aged 19–59 years for HBV infection because screening establishes any history of infection, and vaccination protects from future infection and need for additional testing. The recommendations were supported by peer reviewers who are experts in the field as well as the majority of public comments. Patients with HBV infection have increased morbidity and mortality, and monitoring and treatment can improve health outcomes. If more efficacious treatments are approved in the future, this benefit will increase further. Although increasing awareness of infection is expected to reduce transmission to close contacts, this assumption is hypothetical because of the lack of direct evidence. No studies directly compared universal screening with risk-based screening; therefore, the steering committee relied on the cost-effectiveness study finding that a one-time universal screen of adults is cost-effective and results in improved health outcomes as compared with risk-based screening.

### A 43-year-old woman with abdominal pain and fever [^113QE2RB]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

CLINICAL TEACHING POINTS

Human brucellosis is a very common illness worldwide. Four brucella species — melitensis, suis, abortus and canis — cause the majority of human illness, with B. melitensis being the most common.
Brucellosis is generally transmitted by direct contact with infected animals (cattle, sheep, goats or pigs) or by consuming unpasteurized dairy products. The incubation period is days to months.
Though brucellosis can involve any organ system, it usually presents with nonspecific symptoms, including undulating fevers, night sweats, malaise, weight loss and arthralgias. It can also present with focal brucellosis syndromes, including meningitis, arthritis, endocarditis or epididymoorchitis.
Granulomatous hepatitis is caused by infections (e.g. tuberculosis, histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, Q fever, brucellosis, syphilis, cryptococcosis, leprosy), drugs, malignancy (e.g. lymphomas, renal cell carcinoma) or autoimmune diseases (e.g. sarcoidosis, polymyalgia rheumatica, primary biliary cirrhosis). Up to 20 percent of cases are idiopathic.
The social history is often a key discriminating feature in febrile illnesses, particularly for patients who travel outside of industrialized areas. They are often exposed to infections that are not routinely considered.

### Hepatitis B prevention, diagnosis, treatment and care: a review [^115UCjFV]. Occupational Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) infection is associated with an increased risk of cirrhosis, hepatic decompensation and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The likelihood of developing CHB is related to the age at which infection is acquired; the risk being lowest in adults and > 90% in neonates whose mothers are hepatitis B e antigen positive. Treatment of CHB infection aims to clear HBV DNA and prevent the development of complications. There are currently seven drugs available for the treatment of CHB: five nucleos(t)ide analogues and two interferon-based therapies. Long-term treatment is often required, and the decision to treat is based on clinical assessment including the phase of CHB infection and the presence and extent of liver damage. A safe and effective HBV vaccine has been available since the early 1980s. Vaccination plays a central role in HBV prevention strategies worldwide, and a decline in the incidence and prevalence of HBV infection following the introduction of universal HBV vaccination programmes has been observed in many countries including the United States and parts of South East Asia and Europe. Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) with HBV vaccine ± hepatitis B immunoglobulin is highly effective in preventing mother to child transmission and in preventing transmission following sharps injuries, sexual contact and other exposures to infected blood and body fluids. Transmission of HBV in the health care setting has become an increasingly rare event in developed nations. However, it remains a significant risk in developing countries reflecting the higher prevalence of CHB, limited access to HBV vaccination and PEP and a lack of adherence to standard infection control precautions.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) epidemiology in HIV-exposed and HIV-infected children — chronic HBV is defined as hepatitis B surface antigen persistence for > 6 months, and chronicity after acute infection develops in about 90% of infants, 25% to 50% of children aged 1 to 5 years, and 6% to 10% of older children and adolescents. Transmission can be perinatal, parenteral, postnatal via household contact, or horizontal via contact of non-intact skin or mucous membranes with blood or body fluids; maternal HBV infection is not a contraindication to breastfeeding. Blood transfusion risk where screening exists is very low (1.37 per million donations). Adolescents are at risk through sexual activity or injection-drug use, and in a 43-center study of HIV-infected adolescents 19% had evidence of current or resolved HBV infection; substance abuse and sexual activity increase HIV/HBV coinfection risk, particularly in men who have sex with men (MSM). U.S. surveillance data estimate 0.51% (95% CI: 0.3%–0.9%) of children aged 6 to 19 years had ever been infected with HBV, and one small U.S. case series found 2.6% prevalence in 228 HIV-infected children.

Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by rifampin or other antibacterial drugs in the future.

The patient should be told that rifampin may produce a discoloration (yellow, orange, red, brown) of the teeth, urine, sweat, sputum, and tears, and the patient should be forewarned of this. Soft contact lenses may be permanently stained.

Rifampin is a well characterized and potent inducer of drug metabolizing enzymes and transporters and might therefore decrease or increase concomitant drug exposure and impact safety and efficacy (see DRUG INTERACTIONS). Therefore, patients should be advised not to take any other medication without medical advice.

The patient should be advised that the reliability of oral or other systemic hormonal contraceptives may be affected; consideration should be given to using alternative contraceptive measures.

Patients should be instructed to take rifampin either 1 hour before or 2 hours after a meal with a full glass of water.

Patients should be instructed to notify their physician immediately if they experience any of the following: rash with fever or blisters, with or without peeling skin, itching, or swollen lymph nodes, loss of appetite, malaise, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, darkened urine, yellowish discoloration of the skin and eyes, light-colored bowel movements, fever, headache, fatigue, myalgias, cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, wheezing and pain or swelling of the joints.

Patients should be advised to seek medical advice immediately if their symptoms of mycobacterial disease, including, but not limited to, cough, fever, tiredness, shortness of breath, malaise, headache, pain, night sweats, swollen lymph nodes, loss of appetite, weight loss, weakness, skin ulcers or lesions, worsen (see ADVERSE REACTIONS).

Advise patients to abstain from alcohol, hepatotoxic medications or herbal products while taking rifampin.

Compliance with the full course of therapy must be emphasized, and the importance of not missing any doses must be stressed.

### Sexual transmission of hepatitis B [^116tzT76]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Hepatitis B virus infection is prevalent worldwide and is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality particularly in Asia. Adults chronically infected with hepatitis B virus remain a significant potential source of sexually transmitted hepatitis B. The purpose of this article is to review the recent literature relating to hepatitis B virus transmission with particular emphasis on sexual transmission and efforts to prevent spread.

Recent Findings

The introduction of hepatitis B virus vaccine and the implementation of universal childhood vaccination for hepatitis B in some countries have led to a dramatic reduction in the number of children with chronic hepatitis B. However, recent reports suggest that we are not as successful in preventing infection by sexual transmission. It is clear that sexual transmission of hepatitis B virus is still widespread and is a major problem in certain high-risk groups such as men who have sex with men, intravenous drug users, prisoners and sex workers. Significant problems remain with respect to education and vaccination within these groups.

Summary

Hepatitis B virus remains a major health burden but it is preventable by education and vaccination. Greater resources are required to expand vaccination to the at-risk, sexually active adult populations if the World Health Organization ideal of hepatitis B virus eradication is to be realized and the burden of hepatitis B virus-related morbidity and mortality contained.

Counseling parents and children regarding HCV transmission and prevention — parents should be informed that hepatitis C is not transmitted by casual contact and that children with HCV infection do not pose a risk to other children and can participate in school, sports, and athletic activities and engage in all other regular childhood activities without restrictions (I, B). Parents should be informed that universal precautions should be followed at school and in the home of children with HCV infection, and families and children should be educated about the risk and routes of HCV transmission and the techniques for avoiding blood exposure, such as avoiding the sharing of toothbrushes, razors, and nail clippers and the use of gloves and wiping clean any blood (I, B).

### Blood-borne pathogens and nosocomial infections [^111yd3wP]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2002). Low credibility.

Guidelines to prevent the transmission of blood-borne infections have evolved rapidly since the recognition that "serum hepatitis" could be transmitted to health care personnel via percutaneous exposure to blood. The HIV epidemic focused renewed attention on the problem of protecting health care personnel, culminating in "standard precautions" for patient care, which emphasized the use of gloves for all contact with blood and body fluids. This focus on protection of the health care worker sometimes obscures the other important functions of gloves: protection of patients from microorganisms on the hands of providers and prevention of patient-to-patient transmission of nosocomial pathogens. The risk of infection after percutaneous exposure to the 3 major blood-borne viruses-hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and HIV-varies greatly. The risk for a nonimmune individual exposed to HBV may be > 30% if the source is Hb(e)Ag-positive. The average infection rate for HCV is 1.8%. For HIV, the average risk is 0.3%, but is higher with deep injury, when there is visible blood on the device, when a needle has been in an artery or vein, or when the source patient is in the terminal phase of HIV. Prompt administration of anti-HIV therapy reduces risk by about 80%. Mucous membrane and cutaneous exposures carry less risk. Recent efforts to reduce needlestick injuries in hospitals have reduced the risk to health care providers. Surgeons and other health care professionals who are infected with HIV or HCV pose a very small risk to their patients, although a number of outbreaks have been traced to surgeons who are HBV carriers; most have been Hb(e)Ag-positive.

Q3: How many new infections of HBV would be prevented?
Q3a: What proportion of close contacts are at risk for infection?

The work group did not identify evidence directly assessing the proportion of close contacts (excluding perinatal transmission) who are at risk for infection and thus could not estimate the proportion of new infections that would be prevented by universal adult screening. However, the work group found evidence of the proportion of close contacts of persons with HBV infection who themselves have HBV infection.

From the systematic review, a cohort study of patients with cancer and previous HBV infection found that 8.1% reported having a household contact with HBV infection (who was not a sex partner), and 15.2% reported sexual contact with a person with HBV infection. Of the patients with chronic HBV infection, 0.5% reported a nonsexual household contact with HBV infection, and 1.5% reported sexual contact with a person with HBV infection.

In a study of programs testing and linking patients with hepatitis B to care in the United States, 14% of household contacts of persons who were HBsAg positive were themselves HBsAg positive, and 30% had a history of infection (anti-HBc positive). In 2019, surveillance data indicated that 10% (92 of 899) of persons with acute cases had a sexual contact and 2% (17 of 899) had a nonsexual household contact. However, relying on self-reports of close contacts with HBV infection likely underestimates the risk. Global studies conducted during 1974–2007 found that 14%–60% of persons living in households with persons with chronic HBV infection have serologic evidence of resolved HBV infection, and 3%–30% have chronic infection. Although screening can prevent further spread of HBV infection, the work group was unable to estimate the size of that impact.

Hepatitis B virus (HBV)/hepatitis D virus (HDV) in sports — epidemiology and transmission evidence: Approximately 2 billion people worldwide have evidence of past or present infection with HBV, and 248 million individuals are chronic carriers, with recent CDC investigations reporting approximately 2.2 million chronic carriers in the United States and approximately 21 000 new acute HBV cases reported in 2017. Hepatitis B virus is spread by percutaneous and mucous membrane exposures to infectious body fluids, and the risk of transmission of HBV is 50 to 100 times higher than that of transmission of HIV; HBV can survive ex vivo for up to 7 days. Evidence of transmission during sport activity is limited to 3 case series dated before the year 2000, including documented transmission in Japan in 5 members of a high school sumo-wrestling club and in 11 members of a Japanese university American football team, and a cluster of 568 cases over a six-year period among Swedish cross-country track finders (orienteering).

### Safe and sustainable waste management of self care products [^1177fNSP]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

The transmission rates of bloodborne viruses from patient to healthcare worker are up to 30% for hepatitis B (HBV), 1–3% for hepatitis C (HCV), and 0.3% for HIV due to improperly disposed sharps. These numbers may not result from inoculation of fresh blood as the viruses survive outside the body for varying lengths of time, from four days to three weeks. In 2010, unsafe injections from re-use were responsible for 33 800 new HIV, 1.7 million HBV, and 315 000 HCV infections globally. A study of 141 rubbish collectors in Karachi reported the prevalence of HBV as 18.8%, HCV 8.5%, and HIV 0.85%, with baseline prevalence rates of 2.5%, 5%, and 0.1%, respectively, among adult populations in Pakistan. In the same study it was found that 54% of them had had more them one needlestick injury. Self injection of contraceptives is expected to be increasingly available. This requires cross-sectoral partnerships and guidance for better manufacturing, distribution, and disposal of sharps.

### Prevention of hepatitis B virus infection in the United States: recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices [^114HbA14]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Clinical Management of Exposed HCP

HCP who have anti-HBs < 10 mIU/mL (or who are unvaccinated or incompletely vaccinated) and sustain an exposure to a source patient who is HBsAg-positive or has an unknown HBsAg status should undergo baseline testing for HBV infection as soon as possible after the exposure, and follow-up testing approximately 6 months later. Testing immediately after the exposure should consist of total anti-HBc, and follow-up testing approximately 6 months later should consist of HBsAg and total anti-HBc (Table 5).
HCP exposed to a source patient who is HBsAg-positive or has an unknown HBsAg status do not need to take special precautions to prevent secondary transmission during the follow-up period; however, they should refrain from donating blood, plasma, organs, tissue, or semen. The exposed HCP does not need to modify sexual practices or refrain from becoming pregnant. If an exposed HCP is breastfeeding, she does not need to discontinue. No modifications to an exposed HCP's patient-care responsibilities are necessary to prevent transmission to patients based solely on exposure to a source patient who is HBsAg-positive or has an unknown HBsAg status.

Introduction

Dr Sampurnanand Medical College is one of the popular medical colleges of Rajasthan. The college was established in the year 1965. The land area of the state covered by the medical college is about 60,980 km 2 with a population of approximately 1.3 million. There are about 2000 medical students, 500 doctors, 500 nursing students and 1000 other healthcare workers (HCWs) attached with the medical college.

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is highly infectious and causes serious health problems worldwide. Approximately one third of the world population has been infected, and 400 million have become chronic carriers. HCWs are at high risk for HBV infection because of particular exposure of mucus membranes and breached skin to blood. HBV-infected HCWs also pose a potential risk for patients as there is documented risk of HBV transmission to patients from treating doctors or medical staff. According to WHO, 5.9% of HCWs are each year exposed to blood-borne HBV infections corresponding to about 66,000 HBV infections in HCWs worldwide. Approximately 70% of HCWs in hyper- or intermediate endemic countries have been reported to have needle-stick injuries, with an average of two needle pricks a year. However, only about 10–30% of needle-stick injuries are reported to the authorities. Risk of HBV infection is also related to the HBe antigen (Ag) status of the source person. HCWs who sustained injuries from needles contaminated with blood containing HBV, the risk of developing clinical hepatitis is variable from 1–6% to 22–31% depending on HBeAg (positive or negative) of the source. HBV infections in HCWs without a history of exposure might have resulted from direct or indirect blood or body fluid exposures that have led to inoculation of HBV in the mucosal surfaces or cutaneous scratches. Reports from India indicate that only 16–60% of HCWs have received complete HBV immunization. Paramedics have a higher risk of HBV/HCV transmission and receive HBV vaccination less often than doctors. The practice of universal precautions, such as safe needle disposal, wearing gloves during phlebotomy and using goggles is suboptimal among HCWs in developing countries. In the present study we evaluated the HBV immunization status and anti-HBs titer among the HCWs of Dr Sampurnanand Medical College.

### Screening and testing for hepatitis B virus infection: CDC recommendations-United States, 2023 [^114g9Yqc]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Persons with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection are at increased risk for liver cancer and cirrhosis and are 70%–85% more likely to die prematurely than the general population. An estimated 580,000 to 2.4 million persons are living with HBV infection in the United States, two thirds of whom might be unaware of their infection. Chronic HBV infection disproportionately affects persons born outside the United States; non-U.S.–born persons account for 14% of the general population, but account for 69% of the U.S. population living with chronic HBV infection.

HBV is transmitted through contact with infected blood or body fluids, such as during pregnancy or delivery, through sex, or by injection drug use (IDU), with the greatest risk for chronic infection occurring during perinatal infection. Hepatitis B (HepB) vaccination is highly effective in preventing HBV infection and subsequent liver disease; however, 70% of adults in the United States self-reported they were unvaccinated as of 2018. Although treatment is not considered curative, antiviral treatment, monitoring, and liver cancer surveillance can reduce morbidity and mortality.

To provide a framework for reaching the World Health Organization's viral hepatitis elimination goals, the Viral Hepatitis National Strategic Plan for the United States calls for an increase in the proportion of persons with HBV infection who are aware of their infection from 32% (2013–2016) to 90% by 2030. In support of this goal, this report updates the 2008 CDC recommendations for risk-based testing and management of persons with chronic HBV infection in the United States. This report is a resource to advise health care professionals, public health officials, and organizations supporting awareness, prevention, and linkage to care about who to screen for HBV infection and which groups at risk for infection to test periodically (Box 1).

### AASLD / IDSA practice guideline on treatment of chronic hepatitis B [^112v2DyV]. Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Implementation considerations for high-risk transmission scenarios in CHB — Individuals who are viremic and in high-risk scenarios for transmission may be offered antiviral treatment to reduce risk of transmission, though there are limited data on this issue, with shared decision making critical to evaluate exposure and transmission risk and to consider the vaccine and immunity status of those potentially exposed, favoring antiviral treatment if they are unvaccinated, may have inadequate response to vaccine, have compromised immune systems, and/or have unknown vaccine status; when risks may not be disclosed, individuals requesting treatment for prevention of transmission can be prescribed antiviral medication. It is essential to avoid stigmatizing practices or messages, people with CHB should not be restricted in daily activities and should not be required to take antivirals in those settings, and routine contact, sharing meals, and hugging are not considered routes of transmission, though sharing of personal hygiene items should be avoided. In healthcare settings, most healthcare workers with CHB are not in high-risk scenarios to transmit HBV, but those performing Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA) category III exposure-prone procedures are at higher risk, should follow guidelines from SHEA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and may require antiviral treatment to reduce transmission risk; both CDC and SHEA recommend against the need for healthcare worker disclosure to patients and staff, and CHB is a protected condition by the American with Disabilities Act with protections from discrimination and that all cases of discrimination should be reported to appropriate authorities.

### Human brucellosis, inner Mongolia, China [^11515m9A]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

To the Editor: Brucellosis is one of the most common zoonotic diseases worldwide. The disease is caused by Brucella spp. and mainly transmitted from its animal reservoirs to humans by direct contact with infected animals or through the ingestion of raw milk or unpasteurized cheese. Human brucellosis has a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations, which can vary from subclinical infection with seroconversion to a full-blown clinical picture of fever; osteoarticular involvement; sweating; constitutional symptoms; and hepatic, cardiac, central nervous system, or ocular involvement. Although controlled in many industrialized countries, the disease remains endemic to many parts of the world, including Spain, Latin America, the Middle East, parts of Africa, and Asia. In the People's Republic of China, human brucellosis was highly endemic from the mid-1950s well into the 1970s, but then incidence decreased until the mid-1990s. However, incidence has increased sharply in China since 1995, and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is the most severe endemic focus; most reports of the disease occurred during 1999–2008. National and local public health authorities are concerned about the increasing incidence of the disease in this province. Here we report the epidemic characteristics that existed in this region during 1999–2008.

HBV

Chronic HBV is a global health problem, and its global prevalence in the general population was 3.5% (about 257 million persons), as per the WHO 2017 global hepatitis report. Viral hepatitis was responsible for 887,000 deaths in 2015, and mortality from viral hepatitis increased by 22% between 2000 and 2015. Western Pacific has the highest prevalence of chronic hepatitis B infection but has decreased the infection in the upcoming generation of children to < 1% as a result of multiple successfully implemented strategies targeted at birth immunization, mass seroprevalence assays, regional verification of viral control, and inhibiting mother-to-child transmission of chronic hepatitis B infection. Africa is second to the Western Pacific WHO region in terms of the prevalence of chronic HBV infection (6.1%, 60 million v 6.2%, 115 million). It is hyperendemic (> 8% prevalence of chronic carriers) in some sub-Saharan countries like Nigeria, Gabon, Cameroon, and Burkina Faso; endemic to an intermediate degree (2%-7.99% prevalence)in Kenya, Zambia, Ivory Coast, Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Senegal; and comparatively endemic to low degree (< 2% prevalence)in North African countries, such as Egypt, Tunisia, Algeria, and Morocco(Fig 2). In SSA, HBV transmission occurs predominantly through horizontal route among individuals of the same generation in early childhood. Primary infection occurs mostly through percutaneous infection from saliva, blood, unsterile needles, unsafe blood transfusions, and tribal scarification (practice of scratching, etching, burning or branding or superficially cutting patterns, or images into skin as permanent body modification,), among other vehicles. Birth dose and childhood immunization against HBV in Africa were attempted successfully in certain countries. Several studies from Africa showed a decrease in the prevalence of chronic HBV infection after the introduction of hepatitis B immunization in routine childhood immunization schedules. However, only 19% of 47 African countries introduced birth dose vaccination by July 2017 despite WHO recommending universal HBV birth dose vaccination by 2005. There are numerous challenges associated with effective and timely immunization in African countries, such as lack of infrastructure to maintain vaccines in target temperature range from manufacture to recipient (cold chain management), inadequate access to health care in rural areas, high prevalence of home births, inadequacy of national health policies, and cultural practices of inhabitants, among others.

### Recommendations for identification and public health management of persons with chronic hepatitis B virus infection [^116SCZK8]. Hepatology (2009). Low credibility.

Early identification of persons with chronic HBV infection enables infected persons to receive necessary care to prevent or delay onset of liver disease, and enables the identification and vaccination of susceptible household contacts and sex partners, interrupting ongoing transmission. Testing has been recommended previously to enable primary prevention of HBV infection among close contacts for pregnant women, household contacts and sex partners of HBV-infected persons, persons born in countries with hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) prevalence of more than 8%, persons who are the source of blood or body fluid exposures that might warrant postexposure prophylaxis (e.g., needlestick injury to a healthcare worker or sexual assault), and to enable appropriate treatment for infants born to HBsAg-positive mothers and persons infected with human immunodeficiency virus. Recently, with the increasing availability of efficacious hepatitis B treatment, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published new recommendations for public health evaluation and management for chronically infected persons and their contacts and extended testing recommendations to include persons born in geographic regions with HBsAg prevalence of greater than 2%, men who have sex with men, and injection drug users. Patient and provider education, developing partnerships between health departments and community organizations, and other resources will be needed to assure appropriate populations are tested and care provided for persons newly identified as HBsAg-positive.

### Hepatitis B basics… [^113z54DA]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Hepatitis B is a liver disease caused by the hepatitis B virus.
- HBV infection can be short or long-term.
- About 1 in 2 people with hepatitis B do not know they are infected.
- HBV is contagious and spreads through contact with infected blood and body fluids.
- Vaccination is the best way to prevent infection. About Hepatitis B Hepatitis B is a vaccine-preventable liver infection caused by HBV. HBV is transmitted when blood, semen, or another body fluid from a person infected with the virus enters the body of someone who is uninfected. Hepatitis B can range from a mild, short-term, acute illness lasting a few weeks to a serious, long-term, chronic infection. For Health Care ProvidersClinical Overview of Hepatitis B. Acute hepatitis B Acute hepatitis B is a short-term illness that occurs within the first 6 months after exposure to HBV. Some people with acute hepatitis B have no symptoms or only a mild illness.

For others, acute hepatitis B can cause a more severe illness that requires hospitalization. Signs and symptoms Many people infected with hepatitis B virus won't experience symptoms. If symptoms occur during acute infection, they often begin 90 days after exposure. Although the symptoms of acute HBV infection and chronic HBV infection may be similar, most people with chronic infection do not have symptoms until much later in life, often decades after exposure. Symptoms of hepatitis B include:

- Dark urine or clay-colored stools
- Feeling tired
- Fever
- Joint pain
- Loss of appetite
- Nausea, stomach pain, throwing up
- Yellow skin or eyes Learn more about hepatitis B symptoms. How it spreads Hepatitis B is primarily spread when blood, semen, or certain other body fluids – even in microscopic amounts – from a person infected with HBV enter the body of someone who is not infected.

Although anyone can get hepatitis B, certain life circumstances, jobs, and behaviors can increase your risk. Learn more about specific risk factors for hepatitis B. "Hepatitis B can spread through saliva. " Although HBV can be found in saliva, it is not spread through kissing or sharing utensils. It is also not spread through sneezing, coughing, hugging, breastfeeding, or food or water.

### Responding to HBV exposures in health care settings… [^115GzRfs]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

What to know CDC has developed guidelines for responding to hepatitis B virus exposure in health care facilities as well as settings outside a hospital or clinic. Summary of guidelines and recommendations In the case of an HBV exposure in a health care setting, CDC recommends testing of source patients and clinicians potentially exposed to the virus. A source patient or clinician who is identified as having HBV should be referred to care. The triple panel test, which includes hepatitis B surface antigen, antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen, and total antibody to hepatitis B core antigen, should be used to identify if someone has been infected with hepatitis B. Learn more about CDC's clinical testing guidance.

Recommendation details If you are a clinician who has been exposed to HBV through distinct, identifiable contact with blood or bodily fluids of someone who is infected with HBV, you should immediately clean the point of contact with soap and water. Then follow the guidance below based on the setting and people exposed. The following are guidelines for people exposed to HBV inside a health care facility. These are considered. For additional information and guidelines, see the University of Washington's resource on Occupational HBV Postexposure Prophylaxis. FOOTNOTES: *Through a distinct, identifiable exposure to blood or body fluids that contain blood. ǂ Anti-HBs levels of ≥ 10 mIU/mL are generally considered seroprotective; however, different assays have different assay cutoff values based on which reported levels of anti-HBs might vary depending on the assay used. Refer to the package insert of the test for the determination of actual/correct levels of anti-HBs antibodies.

At-risk clinicians exposed to HBsAg-positive or unknown HBsAg status source patients Clinicians who have anti-HBs of less than 10 mIU/mL and sustain an exposure to a source patient who is HBsAg-positive or has an unknown HBsAg status should undergo baseline testing for HBV infection as soon as possible after the exposure, and follow-up testing approximately 6 months later. Testing immediately after exposure should consist of total anti-HBc, and follow-up testing approximately 6 months later should consist of HBsAg and total anti-HBc.
