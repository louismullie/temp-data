## Question

A 5-year-old with severe photosensitivity, early freckling on sun-exposed skin, neurologic delay, and a confirmed pathogenic XPA gene variant is diagnosed with xeroderma pigmentosum group A. What ICD-10 code should be used for billing this condition?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which ICD-10-CM code should be used for billing a 5-year-old with xeroderma pigmentosum group A due to a pathogenic XPA variant. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the correct ICD-10-CM category for xeroderma pigmentosum. Then, I should verify whether ICD-10-CM provides any subtyping by complementation group or whether a single code applies to all groups. Next, I will check for any coding nuances like laterality or age-related extensions that might apply. Finally, I will confirm the exact code and ensure the documentation supports it, including the genetic confirmation and neurologic features, even if they do not change the code itself.

> Let me first confirm the disease category. Xeroderma pigmentosum is a congenital disorder of DNA repair with marked photosensitivity and increased skin cancer risk, so it belongs in the congenital malformations chapter of ICD-10-CM, specifically under Q82 Other congenital malformations of skin, where Q82.1 is assigned to xeroderma pigmentosum.

> Wait, let me verify whether ICD-10-CM distinguishes among XP complementation groups. I need to check if there are separate codes for XPA, XPC, XPG, etc. Hold on, I should verify this carefully because some coding systems are more granular than others. The ICD-10-CM index lists only Q82.1 for xeroderma pigmentosum without subtyping by group, so XPA, XPC, XPG, and XPV are all coded the same way under Q82.1, even though clinically and genetically they differ in severity and neurologic risk [^112XgDPT].

> I should confirm whether any additional characters are required. ICD-10-CM uses 7-character codes in some categories for laterality or encounter type, but Q82.1 is a standalone code that does not require a 7th character, so no placeholder X or laterality digits are needed here. Let me double-check that to avoid a formatting error, and yes, Q82.1 is complete as is [^112XgDPT].

> Next, I should review what documentation is needed to support the code. Even though the code is not group-specific, I need to ensure the record clearly states the diagnosis of xeroderma pigmentosum and notes the molecular confirmation of an XPA pathogenic variant, along with the clinical features such as severe photosensitivity, early freckling, and neurologic delay, because these justify the diagnosis and may be relevant for care planning and payer review, even if they do not alter the ICD-10-CM code itself [^112XgDPT].

> Putting this together, the appropriate ICD-10-CM diagnosis code for xeroderma pigmentosum group A due to a pathogenic XPA variant in a 5-year-old is Q82.1, with supportive documentation of the genetic finding and clinical phenotype. I should confirm that no additional subcodes or modifiers are applicable, and none are required for Q82.1 in this scenario [^112XgDPT].

---

The ICD-10-CM code for xeroderma pigmentosum group A (XPA) is **Q82.1**. This code applies to all complementation groups, including XPA, and should be used for billing and documentation. No additional subcodes exist for specific XP groups, so **Q82.1** is the most specific available code. Accurate documentation of the genetic confirmation and clinical features (photosensitivity, freckling, neurologic delay) is essential for coding and care coordination [^112XgDPT].

---

## ICD-10-CM code for xeroderma pigmentosum group A

The ICD-10-CM code for xeroderma pigmentosum, including group A, is **Q82.1** — xeroderma pigmentosum. This code is located in Chapter 17 (Congenital malformations, deformations, and chromosomal abnormalities), specifically under Q80–Q89 (Other congenital malformations), subcategory Q82 (Other congenital malformations of skin) [^112XgDPT].

---

## Clinical features of xeroderma pigmentosum group A

XPA is characterized by the following clinical features, which should be documented to support accurate coding and clinical management:

- **Severe photosensitivity**: Extreme sensitivity to ultraviolet (UV) radiation, leading to sunburn after minimal exposure [^114fqCWa].

- **Early freckling**: Lentiginous hyperpigmentation on sun-exposed skin, typically appearing in early childhood [^114xvLjy].

- **Neurologic delay**: Progressive neurodegeneration, including cognitive impairment, sensorineural hearing loss, and motor dysfunction [^113tAa1X].

- **Increased risk of skin cancer**: Basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and melanoma occurring at a young age [^1148trCj].

---

## Genetic basis of xeroderma pigmentosum group A

XPA is caused by mutations in the **XPA gene**, which encodes a protein essential for nucleotide excision repair (NER). Defective NER leads to accumulation of UV-induced DNA damage, resulting in the clinical manifestations of XP [^1163MnQf].

---

## Diagnostic confirmation

Diagnosis of XPA is confirmed by **genetic testing** identifying pathogenic variants in the XPA gene. Functional assays, such as unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS), may also be used to assess DNA repair capacity [^113QpLCL].

---

## Coding considerations and documentation requirements

When coding for XPA, the following considerations and documentation requirements are essential:

- **Specific diagnosis**: Clearly document the diagnosis of xeroderma pigmentosum group A, including the genetic confirmation of XPA mutations [^114xvLjy].

- **Clinical features**: Document the presence of severe photosensitivity, early freckling, and neurologic delay to support the diagnosis and justify medical necessity [^notfound].

- **Family history**: Document any family history of XP or consanguinity, as this supports the autosomal recessive inheritance pattern [^116yWMSu].

---

## Impact of accurate coding on patient care and reimbursement

Accurate coding using **Q82.1** ensures appropriate reimbursement for diagnostic testing, genetic counseling, dermatologic surveillance, and neurologic care. It also facilitates access to specialized care, including dermatology, neurology, ophthalmology, and clinical genetics services [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion

The ICD-10-CM code for xeroderma pigmentosum group A is **Q82.1**. Accurate documentation of the genetic confirmation and clinical features is essential for appropriate coding, reimbursement, and coordination of multidisciplinary care.

### ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM codes: what? Why? How? [^117RwFnX]. Advances in Wound Care (2013). Low credibility.

The wound care industry will gain many benefits when International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10-Clinical Modification (CM) is implemented. One of the main benefits is that the disease classifications will be consistent with current clinical practice and medical technology advances. The new classification codes will be very granular, which means the level of specificity will greatly improve. Numerous new codes will represent more specific anatomic sites, etiologies, comorbidities, and complications, and will improve the ability to demonstrate severity of illness. For instance, the new feature of laterality is directly built into the new codes: separate codes will distinguish right, left, and bilateral, where needed. The increased granularity will provide better analysis of disease patterns and outbreak of disease. Additionally, the United States will finally be using the same diagnosis coding system as the rest of the world. This article will describe what the ICD-9-CM/ICD-10-CM codes are, why they are so important, and how clinicians and researchers will convert from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM effective October 1, 2014.

### Xeroderma pigmentosum clinical practice guidelines [^11598pfJ]. The Journal of Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) is a genetic photosensitive disorder in which patients are highly susceptibe to skin cancers on the sun-exposed body sites. In Japan, more than half of patients (30% worldwide) with XP show complications of idiopathic progressive, intractable neurological symptoms with poor prognoses. Therefore, this disease does not merely present with dermatological symptoms, such as photosensitivity, pigmentary change and skin cancers, but is "an intractable neurological and dermatological disease". For this reason, in March 2007, the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare added XP to the neurocutaneous syndromes that are subject to government research initiatives for overcoming intractable diseases. XP is one of the extremely serious photosensitive disorders in which patients easily develop multiple skin cancers if they are not completely protected from ultraviolet radiation. XP patients thus need to be strictly shielded from sunlight throughout their lives, and they often experience idiopathic neurodegenerative complications that markedly reduce the quality of life for both the patients and their families. Hospitals in Japan often see cases of XP as severely photosensitive in children, and as advanced pigmentary disorders of the sun-exposed area with multiple skin cancers in adults (aged in their 20-40s), making XP an important disease to differentiate in everyday clinical practice. It was thus decided that there was a strong need for clinical practice guidelines dedicated to XP. This process led to the creation of new clinical practice guidelines for XP.

Introduction

Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) is a group of multisystemic autosomal recessive conditions secondary to deficits in DNA repair systems.XP can result from variants in any of eight genes, thus defining eight complementation groups: XPA (XPA, OMIM number: 611153), XPB (ERCC3, OMIM number: 133510), XPC (XPC, OMIM number: 613208), XPD (ERCC2, OMIM number: 126340), XPE (DDB2, OMIM number: 600811), XPF (ERCC4, OMIM number 133520), XPG (ERCC5, OMIM number: 133530) and XP variant or XPV (POLH, OMIM number: 603968). Groups from XPA to XPG present with a defect in the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway (reviewed in Lehmann et al.). This system repairs bulky helix-distorting DNA lesions caused by ultraviolet radiation (UVR) or chemical carcinogens (reviewed in Lehmann et al.and Jeppesen et al.). DNA damage is recognized by two NER sub-pathways, depending on its location. In transcription-coupled NER (TC-NER), damage in transcribed strands of actively transcribed genes is recognized by stalled RNA polymerase molecules. In global genome NER (GG-NER), damage in the rest of the genome is initially recognized by the XPC and XPE proteins. These two proteins participate only in GG-NER, whereas the other XP proteins are required in both sub-pathways, as these converge after the recognition step (reviewed in Jeppesen et al.). Following damage recognition, the damaged area is opened out by the multiprotein complex TFIIH, two of the subunits of which are the XPB and XPD proteins. XPA is involved in verification and correct placement of the proteins relative to the damage. XPF and XPG then cleave the DNA on either side of the damage, after which the resulting gap is filled in by DNA polymerases and ligases. NER is unaffected in XPV, which is caused by a deficit in translesion synthesis (TLS), the process involved in DNA replication past unrepaired damage in the template strand (reviewed in Lehmann).

Xeroderma pigmentosum is a rare photosensitive syndrome that comprises eight different genetic diseases (A to G; variant (V)). Although genotype-phenotype correlations have been evaluated in most XP groups, the relationship between the E subgroup of xeroderma pigmentosum (XP-E) and damage-specific DNA binding protein (DDB) still remained a mystery. Recent studies have provided new insight for XP-E and the role(s) of DDB2, a smaller subunit of DDB. Reclassification studies have confirmed that mutations in DDB2 give rise to XP-E. The mouse model of XP-E demonstrated that DDB2 was well conserved between mouse and human and was critical in controlling proper cell-survival through regulating the tumor suppressor p53-mediated responses after ultraviolet (UV)-irradiation: i.e. defective DDB2 causes the resistance to cell-killing by UV-irradiation due to decreased p53-mediated apoptosis. These phenotypes are unique to XP-E because other XP groups show normal (XP-V) or hypersensitivity (XP-A, B, C, D, F, and G) to UV-irradiation. Thus XP-E is defined as a skin cancer prone disease with unique resistance to UV-irradiation.

Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) is a rare, autosomal-recessive inherited disease that is found worldwide at a frequency of approximately 1:250,000. XP is caused by a deficiency in either nucleotide excision repair (NER) or postreplication repair (PRR), and is characterized by severe actinic changes leading to early onset of skin cancers, various ocular manifestations, and occasional neurological abnormalities. Diagnosis is usually made clinically and can be confirmed by unscheduled DNA synthesis. Early preventative care is the most important treatment modality. We present a review of the history, clinical manifestations, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of XP.

### Two extreme conditions of xeroderma pigmentosum [^113QY8sj]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Two atypical cases of xeroderma pigmentosum are reported. One of these cases with lung metastasis of squamous cell carcinoma in the first decade of life and the other with late onset disease (XP) in fifth decade of life. Lung metastasis of squamous cell carcinoma in first decade of life in patients with xeroderma pigmentosum has never been reported in the literature to our knowledge. Late onset of the disease in fifth decade is also a rare condition. Clinicians should be more alert for the internal organ metastases to improve the survival of the patients and should never forget that xeroderma pigmentosum has got a wide range of clinical presentation.

Introduction

Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) is a rare, autosomal recessive disease that results in sensitivity to ultraviolet (UV) radiation with characteristic cutaneous pigmentary changes and a high frequency of sunlight-induced cutaneous and ocular neoplasms. Phenotypic changes in XP arise from defective repair of UV-induced DNA damage including cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers and 6–4 photoproducts. The nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway is the primary mechanism for excising these UV-induced lesions, and pathogenic mutations within the NER pathway result in one of the 7 classical XP complementation groups (XP-A to XP-G).

About 50% of XP patients present in the first weeks of life with sunburn and extreme sensitivity to sunlight. Poikilodermatous changes develop on sun-exposed areas, and first skin cancer occurs by a median 9 years of age. Patients younger than 20 years with XP have a 2,000-fold increase in melanomas, a 10,000-fold increase in the frequency of nonmelanoma skin cancer, and a 12-fold increased risk of internal malignancy, particularly brain neoplasms. Certain XP complementation groups (A, B, D, G, and F) are associated with progressive neurologic degeneration. Patients with XP have a median mortality of 32 years.

In contrast, patients with XP variant (XP-V) retain a normal NER pathway and have a defect in, POLH, which encodes the protein DNA polymerase eta. First described in 1970 as pigmented xerodermoid, XP-V may comprise 25% of the XP patients in selected genetic populations. Patients with XP-V may have a distinct clinical presentation from their counterparts with NER-deficient XP and may display delayed onset, lack of neurologic findings, and variable severity. Herein, we illustrate this with a patient diagnosed with XP-V late in life, highlighting the need to consider a diagnosis of XP-V in patients of all ages who have multiple cutaneous malignancies of different histologic types.

### Neurological disease in xeroderma pigmentosum: prospective cohort study of its features and progression [^115ovMtH]. Brain (2023). Medium credibility.

Occurrence and onset of neurological symptoms in patients with xeroderma pigmentosum

Overall, 36 patients (38.7% of the total cohort) presented with neurological symptoms (Table 1). More than 50% of patients in the XPG, XPD and XPA groups had neurological symptoms, whereas these were absent in XPE and XPV patients. The most common initial neurological symptoms were imbalance (8.6% of the total sample), neurodevelopmental delay (7.5%), cognitive symptoms (7.5%) and hearing impairment (7.5%) (Supplementary Table 4). Kaplan-Meier and dot plots suggest the existence of two subgroups in XPA, XPD and XPG (Fig. 1C and D). In XPA and XPD, the first group would have an onset below 20 years of age, and the second group, an onset above 45 years of age. For XPG, there is a gap between 4 and 28 years of age in which patients do not present an onset for neurological symptoms.

Age of onset for other disease manifestations and insights into the natural history of xeroderma pigmentosum

As a whole, median survival times for the different symptoms could suggest a sequence of events in some XP patients (Table 1). Skin symptoms are the earliest phenomena (Supplementary Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table 5), marking the onset of the disease and leading to diagnosis in most cases (unless those symptoms are very subtle). Second, ophthalmological symptoms and signs are recognized (Supplementary Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table 6), with neurological features subsequently appearing. Cutaneous cancers would emerge later in life, as these tend to be the result of accumulated actinic damage (Supplementary Fig. 4 and Supplementary Table 7).

Cause of death in xeroderma pigmentosum and neuropathological data

Eight patients passed away during the study: two XPA participants (aged 36, from pneumonia, and 84 years), two XPB cases (one of them aged 55, affected by lung cancer), two XPD patients (aged 28 and 51 years, from sepsis and pneumonia, respectively) and two XPG (aged 9 and 69 years, from urinary sepsis and pulmonary embolism, respectively). Description of the neuropathological findings in the XPD patient who passed away at the age of 28 was available (Supplementary material, Text 2 and Supplementary Figs 5 and 6).

Materials and methods

Study design and participants

We carried out a prospective cohort study based on a single tertiary centre that covers the entire UK population (UK National XP Service, St Thomas' Hospital, Guys' and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK). In the UK, the two diagnostic tests for XP (DNA repair assay and genetic analysis by a NER gene panel) are performed only in the two centres linked to the UK National XP Service (the Genome Damage and Stability Centre at the University of Sussex, and the Genetics Laboratory at Guy's Hospital, respectively). Therefore, all newly diagnosed cases are communicated to the UK National XP Service, and patients are offered clinical care by the medical team. Participants' consent was obtained according to the Declaration of Helsinki, and the study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust (reference number: 12/LO/0325). Collected data span the period from December 2009 to August 2021.

### Identification of a primarily neurological phenotypic expression of xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group A in a Tunisian family [^117HwtgH]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) is a rare genodermatosis predisposing to skin cancers. The disease is classified into eight groups. Among them, XP group A (XP-A) is characterized by the presence of neurological abnormalities in addition to cutaneous symptoms. In the present study, we report a particular family with XP-A in which some members showed an atypical clinical presentation, i.e. unexplained neurological abnormalities with discrete skin manifestations. Molecular investigation allowed identification of a novel XPA mutation and complete phenotype-genotype correlation for this new phenotypic expression of XP-A.

The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) standardizes diagnostic codes into meaningful criteria to enable the storage and retrieval of information regarding patient care. Whereas other countries have been using ICD, 10th Revision (ICD-10), for years, the United States will transition from ICD, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM), to ICD-10, on 1 October 2015. This transition is one of the largest and most technically challenging changes that the medical community has experienced in the past several decades. This article outlines the implications of moving to ICD-10 and recommends resources to facilitate the transition.

### Shining a light on xeroderma pigmentosum [^1138xSTX]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) is a rare, autosomal recessive disorder of DNA repair characterized by sun sensitivity and UV radiation-induced skin and mucous membrane cancers. Initially described in 1874 by Moriz Kaposi in Vienna, nearly 100 years later, James Cleaver in San Francisco reported defective DNA repair in XP cells. This eventually provided the basis for a mechanistic link between sun exposure, DNA damage, somatic mutations, and skin cancer. XP cells were found to have defects in seven of the proteins of the nucleotide excision repair pathway and in DNA polymerase η. XP cells are hypersensitive to killing by UV radiation, and XP cancers have characteristic "UV signature" mutations. Clinical studies at the National Institutes of Health found a nearly 10,000-fold increase in skin cancer in XP patients under the age of 20 years, demonstrating the substantial importance of DNA repair in cancer prevention in the general population. Approximately 25% of XP patients have progressive neurological degeneration with progressive loss of neurons, probably from DNA damage induced by oxidative metabolism, which kills nondividing cells in the nervous system. Interestingly, patients with another disorder, trichothiodystrophy, have defects in some of the same genes as XP, but they have primary developmental abnormalities without an increase in skin cancer.

### Clinical and molecular epidemiological study of xeroderma pigmentosum in China: a case series of 19 patients [^114ovkv6]. The Journal of Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) is a rare genetic disorder which is divided into eight complementation groups: XP-A to XP-G and XP-V. Some XP patients demonstrate severe cutaneous and neurological manifestations, management of which requires timely diagnosis and intervention. We performed clinical evaluation and genetic analysis on 19 patients, the largest cohort of XP to date in China. Twenty-three mutations from six groups were identified, 16 of which were novel. All patients developed marked freckle-like pigmentation on sun-exposed sites while patients with XP-A, XP-D, XP-F and XP-G showed acute sunburn reactions. Only XP-A patients displayed progressive neurological degeneration. A relatively larger proportion of XP-A and XP-C were found in Chinese XP patients. One XP case and two carriers were prenatally determined. This study extended the mutation spectrum of XP in China and may aid in the diagnosis and treatment of Chinese XP patients.

Results

Cohort description

Our study comprised 93 patients with XP, including information from 417 visits (4.48 visits/patient, on average) (Table 1). XPB and XPF were extremely rare in our sample (n = 2 and n = 4, respectively), and these groups were considered only for descriptive purposes. Follow-up time was not statistically different among groups.

Age of disease onset and age of diagnosis

Median survival times for different events in the XP groups are summarized in Table 1. XPD and XPG showed a very early onset for the condition (with at least 50% of patients showing symptoms before the first year of age) (Fig. 1A). Other groups showed a later age of onset, especially XPE and XPV. The first symptoms displayed by patients were mainly severe or exaggerated sunburn (in XPA, XPB, XPD, XPF and XPG) or lentigines (in XPC, XPE and XPV) (Supplementary Table 2). Regarding the diagnosis of the condition (Fig. 1B), many XPC and XPD cases were diagnosed at an early age, having short median diagnostic delays (2 and 3 years, respectively) (Supplementary Table 3). On the contrary, XPV and XPE were diagnosed later in life and showed longer diagnostic delays (27.5 and 29 years, respectively).

### Ready or not! here comes ICD-10 [^114Brojh]. Journal of Neurointerventional Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

The International Classification of Diseases-10 (ICD-10) is a new system that is a federally mandated change affecting all payers and providers, and is expected to exceed both the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and Y2K in terms of costs and risks. In 2003, HIPAA named ICD-9 as the code set for supporting diagnoses and procedures in electronic administrative transactions. However, on 16 January 2009, the Department of Health and Human Services published a regulation requiring the replacement of ICD-9 with ICD-10 as of 1 October 2013. While ICD-9 and ICD-10 have a similar type of hierarchy in their structures, ICD-10 is more complex and incorporates numerous changes. Overall, ICD-10 contains more than 141 000 codes, a whopping 712% increase over the < 20 000 codes in ICD-9, creating enormous complexities, confusion and expense. Published statistics illustrate that there are instances where a single ICD-9 code can map to more than 50 distinct ICD-10 codes. Also, there are multiple instances where a single ICD-10 code can map to more than one ICD-9 code. Proponents of the new ICD-10 system argue that the granularity should lead to improvements in the quality of healthcare whereas detractors of the system see the same granularity as burdensome. The estimated cost per physician is projected to range from $25 000 to $50 000.

Regarding specific circumstances for cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma - NCCN, more specifically with respect to patients at high risk for multiple primary cutaneous SCCs (diagnosis), NCCN 2021 guidelines recommend to recognize that certain patient groups are at high risk for developing multiple primary cutaneous SCCs and tumors that can behave aggressively. These groups include the following:

- organ transplant recipients

- other settings of immunosuppression, such as lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, drug-induced immunosuppression, and HIV

- genetic syndromes predisposing to cutaneous SCC formation, such as xeroderma pigmentosum, generalized eruptive keratoacanthoma of Grzybowski, Rothmund-Thomson syndrome, dyskeratosis congenita, epidermodysplasia verruciformis, recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa, severe generalized junctional epidermolysis bullosa, keratitis, ichthyosis, deafness (KID) syndrome, and Ferguson-Smith disease.

Introduction

Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) is an autosomal recessive disease characterized by abnormally accelerated photoaging skin symptoms for the patient's age caused by failure to repair DNA lesions damaged by ultraviolet radiation. Two sibling cases of Japanese XP-A patients display milder symptoms in those who harbor compound heterozygous mutation of IVS3-1G > C and c.682C > T, (p.R228X). We present a follow-up report on two patients, XP4KO and XP5KO, after a brief report from 25 years ago.

Discussion

The diagnosis of XP is based on clinical and molecular features. Several papers have suggested that the diagnosis can be established using clinical features alone, with functional assays and genetic analysis serving a more complementary role. Key clinical features include early-onset poikiloderma in sun-exposed areas, a history of severe sunburn following minimal sun exposure (acute sun sensitivity), skin cancer development at a young age, and consistent family history. However, only 60% of patients exhibit acute sun sensitivity, and the negative family history does not exclude the diagnosis. Ocular and neurologic manifestations used to support a clinical diagnosis include corneal and conjunctival changes and progressive neurodegeneration, cognitive impairment, and sensorineural hearing loss. Criteria used for a clinical diagnosis do not currently contain well-defined parameters, such as a minimum set of features necessary for confirmation.

Certain guidelines that provide more structured diagnostic criteria suggest that a diagnosis of only possible or probable XP can be made in the presence of characteristic clinical features alone, with some form of molecular testing required for a definitive diagnosis. Other authors support the notion that XP cannot be confirmed without functional assays or genetic analysis. Our patient was diagnosed clinically by the combination of early-onset poikiloderma, the development of skin cancer at a young age, and the presence of corneal opacification with conjunctival melanosis. Genetic testing to assess the patient's complementation group was recommended. However, due to her significant neurologic deterioration at the time, further testing was declined by the family to avoid additional stress to the patient.

Genetic testing classifies patients into one of eight distinct subtypes (XPA – XPG, XPV). In addition to its diagnostic utility, significant implications for prognosis and management warrant routine use. For example, neurodegeneration is rare in XPC, the most common subtype in the United States. In contrast, patients with XPA, the most common subtype in Japan, frequently experience neurodegeneration and have an extremely poor prognosis. Subtype differentiation may lead to more effective, targeted management strategies, as early neurologic rehabilitation and follow-up may be used to maximize the quality of life in patients with XPA, whereas these interventions may be unnecessary for subtypes such as XPC.

### Xeroderma pigmentosum… [^112KsTjJ]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

SELECTED CASE A 19-YEAR-OLD woman, who originally presented to the National Institutes of Health dermatology clinic at 11 years of age, had numerous pigmented macules and considerable actinic damage on sun-exposed skin. She had a basal cell carcinoma of the upper right cheek. Skin that had been shielded from sunlight, such as the undersurface of the upper arm, was virtually free of abnormalities. Her skin disease began during infancy when she suffered repeated acute sunburns after very brief outdoor exposures to sunlight, even in the winter months. By age 2 years her sun-exposed skin had developed pigmented macules that failed to lighten and disappear even after several months of avoiding sunlight. Despite major efforts to prevent further direct sun exposure, her pigmented macules increased in number and she developed photophobia and persistent conjunctival injection. At 4 years of age the.

Fig 2
Severity indices of the current cases are plotted in comparison with those of patients with XP-A with homozygous Japanese XPA founder mutation, IVS3-1G > C. Horizontal axis indicate years and vertical axis indicates severity scores. Scores in swallowing are: 0, normal; 1, infrequent choking; 2, occasional choking; 3, require soft food; 4, requires nasogastric or gastrostomy tube. Scores in walking are: 0, normal; 1, mild difficulty; 2, moderate difficulty, but require little or no assistance; 3, severely disturbed walking, requiring assistance; 4, cannot walk at all, even with assistance. Scores in intellectual impairment are: 0, normal; 1, mild (consistent impairment with partial recollection of events, but with no other difficulties); 2, moderate difficulty handling complex problems; 3, severe impairment with problems; 4, unable to make judgments or solve problems. Scores in motivation are: 0, normal; 1, lacking energy, does not restrict activities; 2, lacking energy, restricts hobbies and interests; 3, lacking energy, restricts routine activities; 4, unable to perform any task. Yellow triangle indicates XP4KO, red circle indicates XP5KO.

Interestingly, XP5KO outlived her sister, and both cutaneous and neurologic manifestations are progressing more slowly than in her sister. They have the same mutation in XPA and were brought up in the same environment. The main difference was the age they began strict sun protection: at 4 years for XP4KO and 2 years for XP5KO. However, this earlier start affecting the slower progress of symptoms in XP5KO remains to be elucidated in future studies.

Noticeable findings in our study were that macroscopically, the substantia nigra lost its black color, and microscopically, the number of neurons containing melanin were markedly reduced and melanin deposits were pale. This provided insight, as melanin is assumed to be a radical scavenger, and some investigators have hypothesized that patients with XP are deficient at repairing DNA damage caused by free radicals produced in the brain, which might damage neuronal cells. Further accumulation of autopsies of XP patients will shed light on the mechanism of neurodegeneration with XP.

### XPA gene mutations resulting in subtle truncation of protein in xeroderma pigmentosum group A patients with mild skin symptoms [^111skDs1]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Comparisons of the clinical manifestations with gene mutations in patients with xeroderma pigmentosum group A (XPA) have suggested that those with mutations closer to the C-terminal coding region of the XPA gene have milder neurological and cutaneous symptoms. Here we report on four middle-aged, newly diagnosed Japanese XPA patients whose unusually mild symptoms, especially those affecting the skin, implicate a reduced association of a subtle defect in the C-terminus of XPA protein with skin lesions. All patients had a heterozygous G → C transversion at the splice acceptor site of XPA intron 3. We identified previously unreported heterozygous mutations in exon 6: a single-base insertion (690insT) in one patient and a four-base insertion (779insTT and 780insTT) in the other patients. These mutations led to the frameshift that created new premature termination codons, resulting in the production of truncated XPA proteins. They were longer than any previously reported truncated XPA protein, suggesting that the minimal cutaneous symptoms in these patients are due to a higher residual level of XPA protein activity and that the subtle defect in the C-terminus of XPA protein is more closely related to neurological impairment than to cutaneous abnormalities.

### Understanding photodermatoses associated with defective DNA repair: syndromes with cancer predisposition [^113PM35L]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Hereditary photodermatoses are a spectrum of rare photosensitive disorders that are often caused by genetic deficiency or malfunction of various components of the DNA repair pathway. This results clinically in extreme photosensitivity, with many syndromes exhibiting an increased risk of cutaneous malignancies. This review will focus specifically on the syndromes with malignant potential, including xeroderma pigmentosum, Bloom syndrome, and Rothmund-Thomson syndrome. The typical phenotypic findings of each disorder will be examined and contrasted, including noncutaneous identifiers to aid in diagnosis. The management of these patients will also be discussed. At this time, the mainstay of therapy remains strict photoprotection; however, genetic therapies are under investigation.

### Novel germline ERCC5 mutations identified in a xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group G pedigree [^112BbVAM]. JAAD Case Reports (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

XP is a rare autosomal recessive, cancer-prone genodermatosis characterized by a defective DNA repair after UV damage, resulting in a higher risk of cutaneous malignancies, including basal cell carcinomas, squamous cell carcinomas, and melanomas in sun-exposed areas. Clinically, patients can present with multiple, early-onset solar lentigines with early development of senile, photoaging-related changes. The histopathologic criteria of certain XP skin lesions include hyperkeratosis, chronic inflammation in the upper dermis, and hyperpigmentation in the early stage with basophilic degeneration of dermal collagen bundles and solar elastosis in the papillary dermis in the later stage. Intensive research of XP patient skin samples has provided a critical disease model for understanding the biologic relationship between UV exposure, point mutations, and the development of skin cancers. Identifying the defective NER mechanism in UV-irradiated cutaneous fibroblasts from XP patients has also led to current understanding and classification of the distinct 7 complementation groups (A-G) of this disease.

Although early diagnosis and treatment of XP may be rendered based on typical clinical and histopathologic features, genetic testing remains one of the most important measures in making a definitive diagnosis and managing patients affected by XP. The genetic testing in this study found that each of the patient's parents contributed 1 of the 2 compound heterozygous mutations, leading to the expression of XP disease in the proband. Taken together, we made a primary diagnosis of XP based on the clinicopathologic features and confirmed the diagnosis of XP-G by genetic testing.

The human ERCC5 gene contains 15 exons, and encodes the XP-G protein, which participates in the NER pathway by making incisions at the 3 ′ end of damaged DNA to release a 25–27 nucleotide DNA fragment containing the damaged photoproduct. Mutations resulting in markedly truncated, inactive XP-G proteins are found in XP/CS complex patients, whereas individuals with XP-G without neurologic disease are found to have missense mutations that retain some functional activity. Although our patient does not meet the diagnostic criteria for the XP/CS complex, her overall clinical presentation is strongly suggestive of some neurologic involvement. We hypothesize that her unique phenotype may be caused by residual functional activity resulting from the missense variant, which may also impact protein translation at the cDNA level.

### Neurological disease in xeroderma pigmentosum: prospective cohort study of its features and progression [^115kZETw]. Brain (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this study, we have performed a deep neurological phenotyping of a large heterogeneous cohort of patients diagnosed with XP, recruited in the UK National XP Service. As in previous studies in Europe and the USA, XPC and XPA were the most represented groups. XPB and XPF were extremely rare in our cohort. Multiple studies have shown that XPF patients may present with mild cutaneous symptoms and late-onset neurological syndromes. Since most patients were referred on the basis of their cutaneous symptoms, it is likely that a group of XPF patients is still undiagnosedand, therefore, could not be considered for the present study.

In our cohort, 38.7% of all patients presented with neurological symptoms. This higher proportion compared to other studies, could be attributed to the group composition of our cohort, although our focus on neurological features and the careful phenotyping of these might have also played a role. The most frequent neurological symptoms at onset were imbalance, neurodevelopmental delay, cognitive symptoms and hearing impairment, which seem to be common in other series. XPA, XPD and XPG showed higher proportions of patients with neurological symptoms, in agreement with previous reports. None of our XPE or XPV patients had neurological complaints. XPC has been traditionally considered a group without neurological manifestations. However, several reports in the literature have described XPC patients with typical, or atypical neurological presentations. The presence of consanguinity and, potentially, other recessive disorders has been suggested as an explanation for these atypical presentations. In our cohort 2/22 XPC patients (9.1%) presented with neurological symptoms, and consanguinity was reported only for one of the patients.

### Cancer and neurologic degeneration in xeroderma pigmentosum: long term follow-up characterises the role of DNA repair [^1148trCj]. Journal of Medical Genetics (2011). Low credibility.

Background

The frequency of cancer, neurologic degeneration and mortality in xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) patients with defective DNA repair was determined in a four decade natural history study.

Methods

All 106 XP patients admitted to the National Institutes of Health from 1971 to 2009 were evaluated from clinical records and follow-up.

Results

In the 65 per cent (n = 69) of patients with skin cancer, non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) was increased 10,000-fold and melanoma was increased 2000-fold in patients under age 20. The 9 year median age at diagnosis of first non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) (n = 64) was significantly younger than the 22 year median age at diagnosis of first melanoma (n = 38)-a relative age reversal from the general population suggesting different mechanisms of carcinogenesis between NMSC and melanoma. XP patients with pronounced burning on minimal sun exposure (n = 65) were less likely to develop skin cancer than those who did not. This may be related to the extreme sun protection they receive from an earlier age, decreasing their total ultraviolet exposure. Progressive neurologic degeneration was present in 24% (n = 25) with 16/25 in complementation group XP-D. The most common causes of death were skin cancer (34%, n = 10), neurologic degeneration (31%, n = 9), and internal cancer (17%, n = 5). The median age at death (29 years) in XP patients with neurodegeneration was significantly younger than those XP patients without neurodegeneration (37 years) (p = 0.02).

Conclusion

This 39 year follow-up study of XP patients indicates a major role of DNA repair genes in the aetiology of skin cancer and neurologic degeneration.

### Updates on coding in dermatology [^114RU11g]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Correct coding is an important component of effective dermatology practice management. Over the past several years there have been updates to many commonly used codes within dermatology. This review highlights many of these updates, such as: the skin biopsy codes have been subdivided to reflect the different biopsy techniques. The definition of complex linear repairs has been updated and clarified. Outpatient and inpatient evaluation and management visits have new coding guidelines to determine level of care. Dermatopathology consultation codes have been updated and category III codes related to digital pathology have been created. Understanding the details and nuances of each of these categories of codes is vital to ensuring appropriate coding is performed.

### Variant subtype of xeroderma pigmentosum diagnosed in a 77-year-old woman [^114xhhCE]. JAAD Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

The defect in XP variant lies in loss of the protein DNA polymerase eta, which is encoded by the POLH gene. Polymerase eta has the unique capacity to replicate through UV-damaged segments of DNA (translesional DNA synthesis). The absence of functional polymerase eta leads to the use of alternate, error-prone polymerases, thereby promoting replication of mutated segments of DNA.

Patients with XP-V typically do not sunburn or present with extreme sunlight sensitivity. They tend to be spared the neurologic findings often seen in NER-deficient XP, and often have a better prognosis and longer life expectancy. Reports of patients with XP-V having their first skin cancer range from as early as 7 years of ageto as late as 71. In one study, up to 40% of patients with XP-V had melanoma and most had a nonmelanoma skin cancer. Occasionally, severe phenotypes resulting in early death have also been reported. The degree of clinical involvement may be dependent on the type of POLH mutation and UV exposure, with mutations in exon 11 having milder phenotypes.

We described a case of a woman with multiple skin cancers of different histologic types who was found to have XP-V late in life. She presented without the internal neoplasms or neurologic degeneration seen in some other XP types; this case illustrates the spectrum of XP disease.

### Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma with cutaneous involvement in a patient with xeroderma pigmentosum type C [^113bmaoh]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Xeroderma pigmentosum type C (XP-C) is a rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder characterized by an inability to repair DNA damage caused by ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Individuals with XP-C have a heightened susceptibility to skin cancer because their genetic mutation hinders the repair of DNA damage induced by exposure to UV radiation.XP poses a significant health risk to affected individuals, making UV protection and regular screenings vital components of their care.

### Diagnosing xeroderma pigmentosum group C by immunohistochemistry [^117Swpen]. The American Journal of Dermatopathology (2010). Low credibility.

Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) is a group of rare inherited human neurocutaneous diseases, and the group C (XPC) is the major group of patients with XP in Europe, North America, and South America. Current molecular diagnostic methods for XP require specialized, expensive, and time-consuming UV sensitivity and DNA repair assays followed by gene sequencing. To determine whether immunohistochemistry (IHC) would be a robust alternative method to diagnose patients with XPC, we stained sections of paraffin-embedded skin biopsies for XPC by IHC, using 69 archived blocks from confirmed or clinically suspect patients with XPA, XPC, XPD, XPE, and without XP. We found that XPC expression was strong in all skin biopsies from patients without (14 of 14) and other patients with XP (4 of 4), whereas XPC expression was lost in all biopsies from confirmed XPC patients (29 of 29). Patches of strong XPC signal could be detected in sun-damaged skin, squamous and basal cell carcinomas from patients with XPC that colocalized with strong expression of p53 and Ki-67. Patients with XPC can therefore be diagnosed by IHC from paraffin-embedded skin biopsies from regions of skin that are without sun damage or sun-induced tumors. IHC is therefore a robust alternative method to diagnose patients with XPC. This fast and inexpensive method should increase the options for the diagnosis of patients with XPC from paraffin-embedded skin biopsies and could be developed for other complementation groups.

### DNA-based prenatal diagnosis in a Chinese family with xeroderma pigmentosum group a… [^111ymjh8]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) is a group of autosomal recessive diseases characterized by hypersensitivity to ultraviolet rays. Among its eight complementation groups, XP group A (XPA) is the most severe type. The XPAC gene has been identified as the defective gene in XPA patients.

Objectives

To examine genomic DNA from a Chinese family with XPA, to determine the XPAC mutation and, after genetic counselling, to undertake DNA-based prenatal diagnosis in a subsequent pregnancy.

Methods

Fetal DNA was extracted from amniotic fluid and used to amplify exon 5 of XPAC containing the potential mutation. Direct sequencing and restriction endonuclease digestion were used for prenatal diagnosis.

Results

We identified a homozygous nonsense XPAC mutation of 631C→ T, which results in an R211X mutation in XPA protein, in the proband. Both her parents are heterozygous. Prenatal diagnosis demonstrated a heterozygous sequence predicting an unaffected child, and a healthy girl was born.

Conclusions

These data provide the first example of a DNA-based prenatal test for genodermatosis in China.

### Neurological disease in xeroderma pigmentosum: prospective cohort study of its features and progression [^113i3JX2]. Brain (2023). Medium credibility.

Our study has some limitations. XP is a very rare condition that comprises several genotypes. Therefore, the sample size of the different complementation groups was reduced, and this may have prevented our study from having enough statistical power to detect all clinically important differences among the groups, or to clarify the potentially confounding effect of different variables (e.g. age, time since onset). Patients with mild skin symptoms and late-onset neurological syndromes may have been under-represented. Our patients were recruited in different stages of the condition and it could be plausible that progression rates of the neurological disease vary along the disease course. Some of the measures were reported retrospectively and, therefore, a recall bias may exist. Our mutation severity score had some degree of subjectivity. The frequency of the abnormal findings in the ancillary tests may be underestimated, as we cannot rule out the presence of subclinical findings in subjects that did not receive these investigations. Finally, we cannot completely rule out that other comorbidities or factors are partially responsible for some of the findings on patients' physical examination or ancillary tests. Abnormalities were presumed to be linked to XP when these were not atypical for the XP neurological disease.

In summary, we have characterized the XP neurological disease in a heterogenous group of patients. It is of the utmost importance to recognize the typical cutaneous and ophthalmological symptoms in patients with idiopathic late-onset neurological syndromes compatible with the XP neurological disease. While a full-blown neurological disease can appear in XPA, XPD and XPG patients, an asymptomatic XP neurological disease could be present in XPC, XPE and XPV patients. Walking and speech in XP patients were specially affected, and both warrant further investigation to explore their potential use as clinical outcomes. Patients' mutation severity could be used as a prognostic biomarker for stratification purposes in future trials. XP patients should receive a multidisciplinary assessment and management, regardless of complementation group, including input from dermatology, ophthalmology, neurology, neuropsychology, clinical genetics, medical photography, specialized nursing and patient support groups.

### Neurological disease in xeroderma pigmentosum: prospective cohort study of its features and progression [^113tAa1X]. Brain (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) results from biallelic mutations in any of eight genes involved in DNA repair systems, thus defining eight different genotypes (XPA, XPB, XPC, XPD, XPE, XPF, XPG and XP variant or XPV). In addition to cutaneous and ophthalmological features, some patients present with XP neurological disease. It is unknown whether the different neurological signs and their progression differ among groups. Therefore, we aim to characterize the XP neurological disease and its evolution in the heterogeneous UK XP cohort.

Patients with XP were followed in the UK National XP Service, from 2009 to 2021. Age of onset for different events was recorded. Cerebellar ataxia and additional neurological signs and symptoms were rated with the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA), the Inventory of Non-Ataxia Signs (INAS) and the Activities of Daily Living questionnaire (ADL). Patients' mutations received scores based on their predicted effects. Data from available ancillary tests were collected.

Ninety-three XP patients were recruited. Thirty-six (38.7%) reported neurological symptoms, especially in the XPA, XPD and XPG groups, with early-onset and late-onset forms, and typically appearing after cutaneous and ophthalmological symptoms. XPA, XPD and XPG patients showed higher SARA scores compared to XPC, XPE and XPV. SARA total scores significantly increased over time in XPD (0.91 points/year, 95% confidence interval: 0.61, 1.21) and XPA (0.63 points/year, 95% confidence interval: 0.38, 0.89). Hyporeflexia, hypopallesthaesia, upper motor neuron signs, chorea, dystonia, oculomotor signs and cognitive impairment were frequent findings in XPA, XPD and XPG. Cerebellar and global brain atrophy, axonal sensory and sensorimotor neuropathies, and sensorineural hearing loss were common findings in patients. Some XPC, XPE and XPV cases presented with abnormalities on examination and/or ancillary tests, suggesting underlying neurological involvement. More severe mutations were associated with a faster progression in SARA total score in XPA (0.40 points/year per 1-unit increase in severity score) and XPD (0.60 points/year per 1-unit increase), and in ADL total score in XPA (0.35 points/year per 1-unit increase).

Symptomatic and asymptomatic forms of neurological disease are frequent in XP patients, and neurological symptoms can be an important cause of disability. Typically, the neurological disease will be preceded by cutaneous and ophthalmological features, and these should be actively searched in patients with idiopathic late-onset neurological syndromes. Scales assessing cerebellar function, especially walking and speech, and disability can show progression in some of the groups. Mutation severity can be used as a prognostic biomarker for stratification purposes in clinical trials.

### Novel germline ERCC5 mutations identified in a xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group G pedigree [^112karLn]. JAAD Case Reports (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) is an autosomal recessive genodermatosis caused by a germline loss of function in DNA repair enzymes. This defect impairs physiologic DNA repair after ultraviolet (UV) radiation–induced damage, which can lead to photosensitivity in about half of all patients, pigmentation abnormalities, and an increased risk of nonmelanoma skin cancers as well as melanoma.XP patients classically exhibit a 10,000-fold increase in the frequency of skin cancers arising in sun-exposed skin, eyes, and other mucosal areas (eg, lips and tongue), which appear at an early age. Prognosis and mortality of XP patients are mostly tightly related to the risk of metastasis of cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas and melanomas but also depend on the extent of the underlying DNA repair deficiency. The life expectancy of XP patients is reduced by 30 years.

Seven genetically distinct complementation groups of XP (designated XP-A through XP-G depending on the gene mutated) with germline loss of function mutations to enzymes are involved in nucleotide excision repair (NER). The degree of photosensitivity, risk of skin cancer, and risk of neurologic abnormality vary from complementation group to group.XP complementation group G (XP-G, OMIM) represents one of the rarest subtypes of XP with mutations identified in the Excision Repair Cross-complementing Rodent Repair Deficiency Complementation Group 5 gene (ERCC5), which encodes an enzyme involved in the incision step during the removal of UV-damaged DNA. XP-G is one of the most clinically lethal subtypes of XP, wherein patients also exhibit clinical features of Cockayne syndrome (CS) or XP with neurologic symptoms. To date, there have been less than 20 XP-G cases reported in the literature. Approximately 30 noncutaneous malignancies have also been associated with this lethal XP subtype. Herein, we report a Chinese proband patient who had XP group G diagnosed, resulting from 2 compound heterozygous germline mutations in ERCC5 — a nonsense mutation from the father and a missense mutation from the mother. To the best of our knowledge, this patient is the first reported XP-G case identified in the Chinese population.

### Patients with xeroderma pigmentosum complementation groups C, E and V do not have abnormal sunburn reactions [^113ikP3E]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder of DNA repair. It is divided into eight complementation groups: XP-A to XP-G (classical XP) and XP variant (XP-V). Severe and prolonged sunburn reactions on minimal sun exposure have been considered a cardinal feature of classical XP. However, it has recently become clear that not all patients have abnormal sunburn reactions.

Objectives

To examine sunburn reactions in a cohort of patients with XP and correlate this to the complementation group.

Methods

Sixty patients with XP attending the U.K. National XP Service from 2010 to 2012 were studied. Their history of burning after minimal sun exposure was assessed using a newly developed sunburn severity score. The age at which the first skin cancer was histologically diagnosed in each patient, and the presence of any neurological abnormality, was also recorded.

Results

Sunburn severity scores were abnormally high in patients with XP-A, XP-D, XP-F and XP-G compared with non-XP controls. There was no significant difference in sunburn score of patients with XP-C, XP-E and XP-V compared with controls (P > 0.05). Patients with XP-C, XP-E and XP-V were more likely to have skin cancer diagnosed at an earlier age than those with severe sunburn on minimal sun exposure. In addition, patients with XP with severe sunburn had an increased frequency of neurological abnormalities.

Conclusions

Not all patients with XP have a history of severe and prolonged sunburn on minimal sun exposure. The normal sunburn response of patients with XP-C, XP-E and XP-V may relate to the preservation of transcription-coupled DNA repair in these groups. Those with a history of severe sunburn on minimal sun exposure developed their first skin cancer at an older age compared with patients with XP-C, XP-E and XP-V, but they had an increased frequency of neurological abnormalities. Physicians need to be aware that about half of all patients with XP will present without a history of abnormal sunburn.

### An XPA gene splicing mutation resulting in trace protein expression in an elderly patient with xeroderma pigmentosum group A without neurological abnormalities [^1149mbRM]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

A certain relationship between XPA gene mutations and the severity of symptoms has been observed in patients with xeroderma pigmentosum group A (XP-A). Patients with mutations within the DNA-binding domain usually exhibit severe symptoms, whereas splicing mutations in the same domain sometimes cause very mild symptoms. This inconsistency can be explained by a small amount of functional XPA protein produced from normally spliced transcripts. We herein report the case of an adult Japanese patient with XP-A with unusually mild symptoms. We identified a homozygous c.529G > A mutation in exon 4 of the XPA gene, which resulted in aberrant splicing with a 29-bp deletion in exon 4 causing a frameshift. Intact mRNA was observable, but a Western blot analysis failed to detect any normal XPA protein. We therefore evaluated the DNA repair capacity in normal cells in which the XPA expression was artificially diminished. The repair capacity was still present in cells with trace levels of the XPA protein. The repair capacity of the cells derived from our patient with mild symptoms was poor by comparison, but still significant compared with that of the cells derived from a patient with XP-A with severe symptoms. These results provide strong evidence that a trace level of XPA protein can still exert a relatively strong repair capacity, resulting in only a mild phenotype.

Cutaneous findings that appear in childhood may be the first sign of a hereditary tumor syndrome. Early detection of genodermatoses allows the patient and at-risk family members to be screened for associated malignancies. This article provides a brief description of the pathogenesis and clinical manifestations of various inherited disorders with skin involvement, along with treatment updates. Advances in molecular-based therapy have spurred development of novel treatment methods for various genodermatoses such as xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) and Gorlin-Goltz syndrome. Further studies are needed to better assess the efficacy of many of these new treatment options.

The forced implementation of ICD-10-CM (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification) codes that are specific to the United States, scheduled for implementation October 1, 2015, which is vastly different from ICD-10 (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision), implemented worldwide, which has 14,400 codes, compared to ICD-10-CM with 144,000 codes to be implemented in the United States is a major concern to practicing U.S. physicians and a bonanza for health IT and hospital industry. This implementation is based on a liberal interpretation of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), which requires an update to ICD-9-CM (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification) and says nothing about ICD-10 or beyond. On June 29, 2015, the Supreme Court ruled that the Environmental Protection Agency unreasonably interpreted the Clean Air Act when it decided to set limits on the emissions of toxic pollutants from power plants, without first considering the costs on the industry. Thus, to do so is applicable to the medical industry with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) unreasonably interpreting HIPAA and imposing existent extensive regulations without considering the cost. In the United States, ICD-10-CM with a 10-fold increase in the number of codes has resulted in a system which has become so complicated that it no longer compares with any other country. Moreover, most WHO members use the ICD-10 system (not ICD-10-CM) only to record mortality in 138 countries or morbidity in 99 countries. Currently, only 10 countries employ ICD-10 (not ICD-10-CM) in the reimbursement process, 6 of which have a single payer health care system. Development of ICD-10-CM is managed by 4 non-physician groups, known as cooperating parties. They include the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), CMS, the American Hospital Association (AHA), and the American Health Information Management Association (AHIMA). The AHIMA has taken the lead with the AHA just behind, both with escalating profits and influence, essentially creating a statutory monopoly for their own benefit. Further, the ICD-10-CM coalition includes 3M which will boost its revenues and profits substantially with its implementation and Blue Cross Blue Shield which has its own agenda. Physician groups are not a party to these cooperating parties or coalitions, having only a peripheral involvement. ICD-10-CM creates numerous deficiencies with 500 codes that are more specific in ICD-9-CM than ICD-10-CM. The costs of an implementation are enormous, along with maintenance costs, productivity, and cash disruptions.

### Estimating the burden and economic impact of pediatric genetic disease [^112Nk4mD]. Genetics in Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

The maximum number of diagnoses and procedures recorded for each inpatient discharge varies by HCUP member state, but up to 15 diagnoses and 15 procedures were included per discharge in the KID data set and coded in ICD-9-CM. In the HCUP data, the first diagnosis is considered the primary diagnosis, and all other ICD-9-CM codes are considered secondary. Using the 919 ICD-9-CM codes, we identified two sets of criteria by which to define the prevalence range. To establish the upper bound of possible GD discharges, we defined the maximum number of discharges of patients with suspected GD as those for which any diagnosis (up to 15 diagnoses per discharge) was included in the list of 919 codes. For a conservative minimum, discharges with a primary diagnosis in the set of ICD-9-CM codes were selected. In HCUP and other claims data sets, the first listed diagnosis is commonly defined as the condition to be chiefly responsible for inpatient admission and care. To account for variability in coding practice and discharges for newborns, in which "live birth" is often coded first, we considered any diagnosis in our maximum definition, as has been done in similar studies. In addition, we required that the ICD-9-CM diagnosis be a clinical indication for genetic testing given the age at discharge. Specifically, an age cutoff was applied based on estimates of genetic test diagnostic yield for a given ICD-9-CM in neonates versus the remaining pediatric population (Table S2). For example, a diagnosis code indicating scoliosis would only be considered suspected GD if observed in a neonate, but not in an adolescent. For each definition, we consider the background population as those patients represented by discharges with no ICD-9-CM diagnoses codes in the list.

### Xeroderma pigmentosum type C with prominent cutaneous manifestations and subclinical neuroimaging abnormalities [^114Pgzc9]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) is an autosomal recessive condition resulting from defects in the nucleotide excision repair pathway, causing heightened ultraviolet radiation sensitivity and significantly elevated risks of dermatological malignancies. This case report details a young adult man in his early 20s diagnosed with XP type C, characterised by severe dermatological manifestations, such as pronounced freckle-like pigmentation and photosensitivity, but notably devoid of neurological symptoms, despite MRI findings of white matter lesions. Molecular genetic analysis confirmed a homozygous c.780-2AC mutation in the XPC gene. Clinical management emphasised stringent photoprotection, continuous thyroid hormone replacement following a prior thyroidectomy and interdisciplinary surveillance to address dermatological and potential neurological sequelae. The findings of this case underscore the critical role of early molecular diagnosis, targeted preventative care, and the necessity of a multidisciplinary approach to optimise patient outcomes and mitigate disease progression.

### Necessity and implications of ICD-10: facts and fallacies [^11523574]. Pain Physician (2011). Low credibility.

The International Classification of Diseases-10 (ICD-10 is a new system that is expected to be implemented effective on October 1, 2013. This new system is a federally mandated change affecting all payers and providers, and is expected to exceed both the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and Y2K in terms of costs and risks. However, the Administration is poised to implement these changes at a rapid pace which could be problematic for health care in the United States. In 2003, HIPAA named ICD-9 as the code set for supporting diagnoses and procedures in electronic administrative transactions. However, on January 16, 2009, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) published a regulation requiring the replacement of ICD-9 with ICD-10 as of October 1, 2013. While ICD-9 and 10 have a similar type of hierarchy in their structures, the ICD-10 is more complex and incorporates numerous changes. Overall, ICD-10 contains over 141,000 codes, a whopping 712% increase over the less than 20,000 codes in ICD-9, creating enormous complexities, confusion, and expense. Multiple published statistics illustrate that there are approximately 119 instances where a single ICD-9 code can map to more than 100 distinct ICD-10 codes, whereas there are 255 instances where a single ICD-9 code can map to more than 50 ICD-10 codes. To add to the confusion, there are 3,684 instances in the mapping for diseases where a single ICD-10 code can map to more than one ICD-9 code. Proponents of the new ICD-10 system argue that the granularity should lead to improvements in the quality of health care, since more precise coding that more accurately reflects actual patient conditions will permit smarter and more effective disease management in pay-for-performance programs. This, in essence, encapsulates the benefits that supporters of this new system believe will be realized, even though many of these experts may not be involved in actual day-to-day medical practices. Detractors of the system see the same granularity as burdensome. The estimated cost per physician is projected to range from $25,000 to $50,000. Further, they argue that the ICD-10 classification is extremely complicated, and expensive. Concerns exist that it is being implemented without establishing either the necessity or thinking through the unintended consequences. Opponents also argue that beyond financial expense, it is also costly in terms of human toll, hardware and software expenses and has the potential to delay reimbursement. There is also concern that an unintended consequence of granularity would be the potential for enhanced and unnecessary fraud and abuse investigations. The authors of this article favor postponing the implementation of the ICD-10 until such time as its necessity is proven and implications are understood.

### Variant subtype of xeroderma pigmentosum diagnosed in a 77-year-old woman [^114EHexY]. JAAD Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Fig 3
Ulcerated plaque that brought patient to medical attention. The ulcerated, 3.5- × 2.9-cm plaque in the right retroauricular sulcus with rolled borders that brought the patient to medical attention was later found to be BCC.

Biopsies at her initial visit found 5 basal cell carcinomas (BCC) (retroauricular sulcus, jawline, tragus, anterior scalp, and clavicle); 1 invasive squamous cell carcinoma on the cutaneous lip, and 1 melanoma in situ of the right side of the neck. She underwent Mohs micrographic surgery for the BCC and squamous cell carcinoma, with coordinated care with plastic surgery for the lesion on the right retroauricular sulcus, she underwent wide local excision of the melanoma in situ. She received extensive counseling that she and family members would benefit from sun protection and early, regular dermatologic intervention. For chemoprevention of the nonmelanoma skin cancers, acitretin, 17.5 mg daily, was prescribed, with strict sun avoidance. Given the extensive presence of cutaneous carcinomas, she was included in a National Institutes of Health natural history study of XP, which includes sequencing known XP genes.

Sanger sequencing was performed on DNA harvested from peripheral blood mononuclear cells. All POLH and XPC gene exons, including splice donor and acceptor sites, were polymerase chain reaction–amplified using intronic primers flanking these sequences and sequenced as previously described. Sequencing found a novel homozygous 2-nucleotide deletion [c.1643_1644delCA, p. Ser548Cysfs*13] in exon 11 of the POLH gene [NM_006502.2]. The 2-base deletion leads to a frame shift and creation of a premature stop codon that is expected to encode a truncated POLH protein, assigning the patient to the XP variant subtype. Functional testing of cultured cells was not performed.

### The founding members of xeroderma pigmentosum group G produce XPG protein with severely impaired endonuclease activity [^1165vqLi]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2002). Low credibility.

Of the eight human genes implicated in xeroderma pigmentosum, defects in XPG produce some of the most clinically diverse symptoms. These range from mild freckling to severe skeletal and neurologic abnormalities characteristic of Cockayne syndrome. Mildly affected xeroderma pigmentosum group G patients have diminished XPG endonuclease activity in nucleotide excision repair, whereas severely affected xeroderma pigmentosum group G/Cockayne syndrome patients produce truncated XPG proteins that are unable to function in either nucleotide excision repair or the transcription-coupled repair of oxidative lesions. The first two xeroderma pigmentosum group G patients, XP2BI and XP3BR, were reported before the relationship between xeroderma pigmentosum group G and Cockayne syndrome was appreciated. Here we provide evidence that both patients produce truncated proteins from one XPG allele. From the second allele, XP2BI generates full-length XPG of 1186 amino acids containing a single L858P substitution that has reduced stability and greatly impaired endonuclease activity. In XP3BR, a single base deletion and alternative splicing at a rare noncanonical AT-AC intron produces a 1185 amino acid protein containing 44 internal non-XPG residues. This protein is stably expressed but it also has greatly impaired endonuclease activity. These four XPG products can thus account for the severe ultraviolet sensitivity of XP2BI and XP3BR fibroblasts. These cells, unlike those from xeroderma pigmentosum group G/Cockayne syndrome patients, are capable of limited transcription-coupled repair of oxidative lesions. Our results suggest that the L858P protein in XP2BI and the almost full-length XPG protein in XP3BR are responsible for this activity and for the absence of severe early onset Cockayne syndrome symptoms in these patients.

### A novel XPA gene mutation and its functional analysis in a Japanese patient with xeroderma pigmentosum group a… [^115L8YFH]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

Most Japanese patients with xeroderma pigmentosum group A (XPA) have the homozygous intron 3 splicing mutations (AlwNI mutation). Here, we report a Japanese XPA patient, XP79KO, a compound heterozygote with a newly identified T to G transversion at splice donor site in intron 1 in one allele, and with the AlwNI mutation in another allele in the XPA gene. The mutation in intron 1 creates two new abnormal splice sites that resulted in two types of aberrant mRNA. These abnormal splicings cause frameshifts that make stop codons downstream. No XPA protein was detected in XP79KO fibroblasts.

### Xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group F: report of a case and review of Japanese patients [^113EcDiL]. The Journal of Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder characterized by extraordinary sensitivity to sunlight, resulting in cutaneous malignant tumors. Among XP, XP-F presents relatively uniquely in Japanese. To clarify the characteristics of this group, we describe a case of XP-F and review Japanese cases previously reported. A 50-year-old Japanese woman was referred to us with multiple, variously sized, light- or dark-brown macules on the face and sunlight-exposed extremities. She had experienced bulla formation with approximately 10 min of sunlight exposure during her elementary school years. Her parents had been first cousins, and her mother and sister had photosensitivity. She showed no neurological or developmental abnormalities. Ultraviolet (UV) irradiation testing revealed normal levels for minimal erythema dose with UV-A and UV-B. Sensitivity to UV-C and DNA repair ability in the patient's fibroblasts were indicated between that in normal individuals and that in an XP-A patient. Complementation assay revealed that transfection of the XPF gene led most efficient DNA repair compared with the other XP genes. Therefore, the patient was diagnosed with XP-F. Twenty-three cases of Japanese patients (six males, 17 females) with XP-F have been reported, including the present case. Our review suggested a relatively high prevalence of 50% (11/22) for cutaneous malignant tumors. A significant difference was evident in the mean age at first medical consultation between patients with cutaneous malignant tumors (53.6 years) and patients without such tumors (30.8 years). This suggests that cutaneous malignant tumors could occur in the age range of 30–50 years in XP-F patients.

### A splicing variant in XPA results in delayed onset of clinical features of xeroderma pigmentosum [^111mK6Wz]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by defective nucleotide excision repair (NER), leading to extreme sensitivity to sunlight-induced skin pigmentation changes and increased skin cancer risk. XP patients present with varying severity, often influenced by specific variants in NER-associated genes. Here, we describe two unrelated Cypriot XP-A patients with a mild phenotype linked to a homozygous missense variant (c.389G > A, p.R130K). The older patient, aged 69, developed progressive neurological degeneration in his 40s, while the younger patient, aged 32, has no neurological abnormalities to date. Molecular analysis revealed a severe transcription-coupled NER (TC-NER) defect and reduced global genome repair (GG-NER) in patient fibroblasts, consistent with the XP-A diagnosis. Surprisingly, very low XPA protein levels were detected, despite the conservative amino acid substitution. Further experiments demonstrated that while the XPA R130K protein variant is both stable and functional in NER, it is a splice defect in the XPA c.389G > A gene in patients that leads to reduced XPA mRNA levels, ultimately explaining the low protein levels and residual NER activity in patients. This study highlights the complex relationship between genotype, splicing, and clinical phenotype in XP-A patients.

### Multiple facial basal cell carcinoma with xeroderma pigmentosum [^115wLL3c]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Multiple basal cell carcinomas are rare in children and adolescents. Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) is a rare autosomal recessive hereditary disease characterized by photosensitivity, changes in skin pigmentation, and early onset of skin cancer. XP is extremely rare in clinical practice, with only a few cases worldwide. XP is clinically incurable. The main goal of treating this disease is to diagnose as early as possible, educate patients to strictly avoid ultraviolet radiation for life, and follow up regularly to treat skin malignant tumors in time. The authors report a 15-year-old boy with facial multiple basal cell carcinoma with XP. Its medical history, clinical features, auxiliary examination, and surgical treatment process have great reference value for the in-depth understanding of the disease. The authors will discuss how to delay the progression of the disease and treat the existing lesions in different clinical stages of the disease in combination with the existing relevant literature.

### Xeroderma pigmentosum-variant patients from America, Europe, and Asia [^115DRx54]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

Xeroderma pigmentosum-variant (XP-V) patients have sun sensitivity and increased skin cancer risk. Their cells have normal nucleotide excision repair, but have defects in the POLH gene encoding an error-prone polymerase, DNA polymerase eta (pol eta). To survey the molecular basis of XP-V worldwide, we measured pol eta protein in skin fibroblasts from putative XP-V patients (aged 8–66 years) from 10 families in North America, Turkey, Israel, Germany, and Korea. Pol eta was undetectable in cells from patients in eight families, whereas two showed faint bands. DNA sequencing identified 10 different POLH mutations. There were two splicing, one nonsense, five frameshift (3 deletion and 2 insertion), and two missense mutations. Nine of these mutations involved the catalytic domain. Although affected siblings had similar clinical features, the relation between the clinical features and the mutations was not clear. POLH mRNA levels were normal or reduced by 50% in three cell strains with undetectable levels of pol eta protein, indicating that nonsense-mediated message decay was limited. We found a wide spectrum of mutations in the POLH gene among XP-V patients in different countries, suggesting that many of these mutations arose independently.

### No association between three xeroderma pigmentosum group C and one group G gene polymorphisms and risk of cutaneous melanoma [^111aMpmK]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2005). Low credibility.

Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) patients exhibit a 1000-fold increased risk for developing skin cancers including malignant melanoma. We investigated the role of three variant alleles of the DNA repair gene XPC and one variant allele of the XPG gene in a hospital-based case-control study of 294 Caucasian patients from Germany with malignant melanoma and 375 healthy control individuals from the same area matched by sex. The polymorphisms G1580A (XPC exon 8; Arg492His), T1601C (XPC exon 8; Val499Ala), G2166A (XPC exon 10; Arg687Arg), and C3507G (XPG exon 15; Asp1104His) were not in linkage disequilibrium. The allele frequencies (cases: controls) were for 1580A 6.29%: 5.63%, for 1601C 79.08%: 78.28%, for 2166A 26.19%: 28.13%, and for 3507G 79.86%: 78.61%. We found no association of the homozygous 1580A, 1601C, 2166A, and 3507G genotypes with increased risks of melanoma: OR 1.254 (95% CI: 0.486–3.217), OR 1.108 (95% CI: 0.629–1.960), OR 0.817 (95% CI: 0.490–1.358), and OR 1.168 (95% CI: 0.670–2.044), respectively. Exploratory analyses of subgroups of melanoma patients compared to all controls indicated no association of these genotypes with increased risks for development of multiple primary melanomas (n = 28), a negative family history for melanoma (n = 277), melanomas in individuals with a low number of nevi (n = 273), melanomas in individuals older than 55 years (n = 142), and melanomas thicker than 1 mm (n = 126).

### Peripheral neuropathies associated with DNA repair disorders [^115A8T6h]. Muscle & Nerve (2023). Medium credibility.

3 NEUROPATHIES INREPAIR AND GENOME INSTABILITY DISORDERS

3.1 XP

Xeroderma pigmentosum is a rare, autosomal recessive genetic disorder that affects an estimated 2.3 per million livebirths in Western Europe, 1 in 22 000 in Japan, and 1 per million in the United States. The disease affects males and females equally and is statistically more common in certain regions, including Japan, North Africa, and the Middle East. Patients with XP are hypersensitive to DNA damage from UV radiation and typically experience severe sunburns, increased freckles, and increased susceptibility to skin cancer. In 60% of XP cases, extreme sensitivity to sunlight is apparent within the first few weeks of life. The remaining 40% of cases typically display freckle‐like pigmentation on sun‐exposed skin by 2 years of age.

The degree of UV sensitivity can vary between XP patients and basal‐ and squamous‐cell carcinomas are the most prevalent types of skin tumors.XP is caused by pathogenic variants in one of multiple XP genes that encode proteins involved in NER (Table 1). Although the resulting deficiency in NER is consistent throughout XP, the various functions of specific XP proteins and the severity of the pathogenic variant (null variants versus partial impairments) can both influence disease presentation in XP patients. The central nervous system is affected in ~25% of XP patients, and an estimated 20% to 30% display sensorineural abnormalities that include ataxia, hearing loss, as well as sensory and sensorimotor peripheral neuropathies (Table 2). Of the XP genetic subtypes, XPA, XPB, XPD, XPF, and XPG are those that have been found to be associated in some cases with neurological symptoms, with XPA and XPD being the genetic subtypes most frequently associated with neurological degeneration. Conversely, patients with XPC and XPE rarely display neurological manifestations, although there is one published case of an XPC patient developing a peripheral neuropathy at age 47.

### International classification of diseases (ICD-11) and neurologic disorders: the future [^116FR6fF]. Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

When the WHO's Topic Advisory Group for Neurology (TAG) started work on revision of the ICD-10 diagnostic codes in June 2009, the issues were daunting. The existing classification was produced a generation ago and the need to move to the digital age was becoming imperative. Appreciating modern advances in genetics and immunology, and the consequent changes in understanding of the pathophysiology of disorders of the nervous system, WHO's charge to the TAG was to produce a comprehensive, up-to-date disease classification, while providing published or consensus evidence for each coding change. In addition, the task would be to focus on ways to reduce the treatment gap while considering the utility of ICD-11 when used in primary care and nonspecialist settings. The project mushroomed over the 3 years since our first meeting and continues to do so. The work was made even more difficult as the group needed to add "content models" for the major codes for the first time (i.e., providing a definition for each disorder, along with appropriate diagnostic tests and outcome). The ICD-11 is meant to be updated as new knowledge develops, rather than waiting some years for another whole-scale revision, but this process has yet to be defined.

Results

Case description: patients 1 and 2

Monozygotic twin sisters (XP2003VI and XP2004VI) were diagnosed with XP during their first year of life due to very high sun-sensitivity. Genetic testing revealed homozygous c.1643_1644delTG; p. Val548Alafs25 (called therefore delTG) mutation in the XPC gene, thus confirming the diagnosis (Table 1, Fig. 1a). The patients were not diagnosed with skin cancers but had actinic keratosis and freckles on their faces. The patients were from consanguineous family. For both 16 years old-patients, following hemorrhages a large cervical mass that was prolapsing through the vagina, was discovered following pelvic MRI with no local extension. Histological examination of the biopsies confirmed a vaginal embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (vERMS). The tumoral cells were positive for Desmin and Myogenin expression. These tumors were classified Group C following the RMS 2005 protocol.

### 'Get data out' skin: national cancer registry incidence and survival rates for all registered skin tumour groups for 2013–2019 in england [^1175LGrb]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Providing detailed skin cancer statistics, including incidence and survival, by tumour type and patient characteristics is important for up-to-date epidemiological information.

Objectives

To create a new clinically relevant consensus-based classification for registered skin tumours using tumour type and patient characteristics and to describe its application to all registered tumours in England between 2013 and 2019.

Methods

Tumours with skin topographical codes (ICD-10) and morphology and behaviour (ICD-O3) were grouped together in an iterative process creating a hierarchical tree structure. The primary-level grouping partitioned skin tumours into skin cancer, melanoma in situ, extramammary Paget disease (EMPD) and tumours of uncertain malignant potential. Second-level groups split skin cancer into keratinocyte cancer (KC), melanoma and rare cancers. The third-level group split KC into basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC). Further groups were split into genital or non-genital, first or subsequent tumour, age, gender, stage, or National Health Service (NHS) region. Incidence counts, Kaplan-Meier and net survival estimates and referral routes [two-week wait (TWW), general practitioner (GP), outpatient] categorisations were calculated for each grouping across all years.

Results

A total of 1 445 377 skin cancers and 49 123 precancerous lesions and undefined entities were registered in England between 2013 and 2019. Skin tumours and skin cancer incidence rates are increasing for most tumour types. The most common type of skin cancer was BCC with an incidence rate of 282.36 per 100 000 person-years (PYs) [n = 158 934, 95% confidence interval (CI) 280.98–283.76] in 2019, followed by cSCC with an incidence rate of 85.24 per 100 000 PYs (n = 47 977, 95% CI 84.48–86.00) and melanoma with 27.24 (n = 15 332, 95% CI 26.81–27.67) per 100 000 PYs. Each year approximately 1800 rare skin cancers, 1500 genital cSCCs and 100 cases of EMPD are registered. Of 15 000 melanoma cases, 120 cases of melanoma occur in individuals aged < 25years annually. One-year and five-year overall net survival varies by tumour type. cSCC 5-year net survival (89.8%, 95% CI 88.8–90.9) was comparable to the net survival of all melanomas (89.6%, 95% CI 88.7–90.6). BCC had excellent survival (overall net survival > 100%). Patients with late-stage melanoma, Merkel cell carcinoma and genital cSCC have a 5-year net survival < 60%. Older patients received fewer TWW referrals than their younger counterparts with the same tumour type at the same location. Patients with acral lentiginous melanoma had fewer TWW referrals and more standard GP referrals than patients with common melanomas.

Conclusions

'Get Data Out' Skin provides detailed and up-to-date statistics on all registrable skin tumours in England, including for the first time precancerous lesions and rare subtypes of common cancers. These data can be used by clinicians, researchers and commissioners to better understand skin cancer and improve resource allocation.

The UPDB, housed at the Huntsman Cancer Center at the University of Utah, is a globally unique database that, for nearly 40 years, has enabled epidemiological and outcomes research to be conducted at the Utah population level. Using this resource, pedigrees can be identified with excess clustering of XFS in the Utah population to study familial XFS pathologies and examine associated comorbidities in both individuals and high-risk XFS families.

For UPEXS, participants' historical data under an IRB-approved waiver of consent were obtained from the UPDB. We identified 2943 patients diagnosed in Utah with XFS between 1996 and 2015 for our studies and confirmed International Classification of Diseases (ICD) coding accuracy by randomised chart review. Sixty-eight per cent of our individuals with XFS were female, while 32% were male. Approximately 25% of this XFS case population was between 50 and 69, while 75% were between the age of 70 and 90. Over 95% of the population is white. The epidemiological characteristics of this XFS population closely mirror those of the Olmstead Study (Minnesota), which found that XFS incidence increased with age, with a mean age of diagnosis of 73 years, is derived from a population that was 95% white and 76% female. As a comparison cohort, population-based controls with no XFS history in UPDB were randomly selected and matched to XFS on sex, birth year, and follow-up time in Utah in a 5:1 ratio (N = 17 413). A diagram of the UPEXS resource, including XFS patient and controls selection and XFS-associated comorbidity cohorts, is shown in figure 1.

### Ocular lesions in xeroderma pigmentosum… [^116yWMSu]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

GILLER H, KAUFMANN WC. Ocular Lesions in Xeroderma Pigmentosum: A Case Report of Carcinoma of the Cornea. AMA Arch Ophthalmol. 1959; 62: 130–133. doi: 10.1001/archopht.1959.04220010134016 Xeroderma pigmentosum, also known as Kaposi's disease or lentigo maligna, was first described in
1870. It is a rare, progressive, precancerous disease of the skin and mucous membranes and frequently displays ocular complications. Mental deficiency has been noted in some patients. It tends to occur in the children of consanguineous marriages, being transmitted as a simple recessive character, and several siblings may have the disease. The pathogenic factor underlying the condition is considered to be a reaction of the surface epithelium to an abnormal organic or chemical disturbance within the body. Sunlight is the precipitating agent of this disease. The patients usually have normal skins at birth.

Xeroderma pigmentosum usually appears before the second year of life as a persistent erythema of the face, neck, and arms after exposure to sunlight but differing from ordinary sunburn in that it takes longer to disappear.

### Prenatal diagnosis of xeroderma pigmentosum group A in Japan [^114eUTUE]. The Journal of Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

We performed a prenatal diagnosis for 10 fetuses from nine unrelated Japanese xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group A (XP-A) families. All parents had at least one XP-A child (proband) with a homozygous founder mutation (IVS3-1G > C) in the XPA gene. A genetic analysis was performed by a restriction enzyme; AlwNI fragment length polymorphism of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-amplified DNA, mostly from amniotic fluid (AF) and cultured cells established from AF. However, for the first family, we tried amniocentesis as well as chorionic villus sampling (CVS). Among the 10 cases, we confirmed the results of PCR-based genetic diagnosis by post-ultraviolet survival of amniotic cells in eight cases. Unfortunately, 6 weeks after CVS and 4 days after the amniocentesis in the first case we examined, the fetus died in utero, the reason for which remains unexplained. We prenatally determined two XP-A cases, six XP-A carriers and two wild-type fetuses, which appears to be consistent with Mendel's law.

### Testing and extending strategies for identifying genetic disease-related encounters in pediatric patients [^112Tc72x]. Genetics in Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To better understand health care utilization and develop decision support tools, methods for identifying patients with suspected genetic diseases (GDs) are needed. Previous studies had identified inpatient-relevant International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes that were possibly, probably, or definitely indicative of GDs. We assessed whether these codes identified GD-related inpatient, outpatient, and emergency department encounters among pediatric patients with suspected GDs from a previous study (the North Carolina Clinical Genomic Evaluation by Next-Generation Exome Sequencing [NCGENES] study).

Methods

Using the electronic medical records of 140 pediatric patients from the NCGENES study, we characterized the presence of ICD codes representing possible, probable, or definite GD-related diagnoses across encounter types. In addition, we examined codes from encounters for which initially no GD-related codes had been found and determined whether these codes were indicative of a GD.

Results

Among NCGENES patients with visits between 2014 and 2017, 92% of inpatient, 75% of emergency department, and 63% of outpatient encounters included ≥ 1 GD-related code. Encounters with highly specific (ie, definite) GD codes had fewer low-specificity GD codes than encounters with only low-specificity GD codes. We identified an additional 32 ICD-9 and 56 ICD-10 codes possibly indicative of a GD.

Conclusion

Code-based strategies can be refined to assess health care utilization among pediatric patients and may contribute to a systematic approach to identify patients with suspected GDs.

### Positive predictive value highlights four novel candidates for actionable genetic screening from analysis of 220, 000 clinicogenomic records [^117Jv8Bi]. Genetics in Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Phenotypes

HNP phenotypes were processed from Epic/Clarity Electronic Health Records (EHR) data as previously described. UKB data were provided from the UKB resource (, accessed August 2020). For HNP, International Classification of Diseases, Ninth and Tenth Revision ICD codes (ICD-9 and ICD-10-cm) were collected from available diagnosis tables (from problem lists, medical histories, admissions data, surgical case data, account data, claims, and invoices). For UKB, ICD codes (both ICD-9 and ICD-10) were collected from inpatient data, cancer registry table, and the first occurrences table (resource 593).

To map ICD to phecodes, ICD-9 (Phecode Map 1.2, used for both cohorts), ICD-10 (Phecode Map 1.2b to ICD-10 beta, used for UKB), and ICD-10-CM (Phecode Map 1.2b to ICD-10-CM beta, used for HNP) to phecode maps from the Phewas catalog were used to code individuals as a 1 if they had the phecode recorded at least once in their medical records, and otherwise 0. Analysis phenotypes were restricted to have cases in both cohorts, with at least 30 cases in the HNP data set (n = 1,044 phenotypes).

When identifying age at diagnosis, we required at least 5 years of medical history prior to the diagnosis, meaning the first diagnosis of any condition in the record must occur at least 5 years prior to the diagnosis in question, except for when diagnosis occurred in the first five years of life.

### Recent developments in the diagnosis and management of photosensitive disorders [^111LnpbU]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Photodermatoses occur in males and females of all races and ages. Onset can be variable in timing and influenced by genetic and environmental factors. Photodermatoses are broadly classified as immunologically mediated, chemical- and drug-induced, photoaggravated, and genetic (defective DNA repair or chromosomal instability) diseases. Advances in the field have led to improved recognition and treatment of many photodermatoses. The purpose of this focused review is to provide an update on the diagnosis and management of a variety of photodermatoses, both common and less common, with review of recent updates in the literature pertaining to their diagnosis and management.

### Estimating the burden and economic impact of pediatric genetic disease [^116UZ5r7]. Genetics in Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

A total of 3,195,782 records, weighted to represent a national estimate of 5.85 million discharges, were identified for children less than 18 years of age in the 2012 KID. We calculated 4.37 million discharges for children less than 1 year of age, with 3.92 million of those representing neonates (nonmaternal records, 67%), with neonate status defined by admission during the first 28 days after birth. Of the neonates, a weighted 1.30 million records (33%) were labeled as complicated births.

For all analyses, unless otherwise noted, we calculated the range of potential values using the minimum and maximum estimates as defined in "Materials and Methods". In brief, minimum estimates of GD required the discharge to have a GD-associated ICD-9-CM code as the primary diagnosis, while the maximum estimate required a GD-associated ICD-9-CM code anywhere in the diagnostic code list.

We identified a weighted estimate of 150,169 (2.6%) to 818,384 (14%) discharges with suspected GD. The range of GD estimates varied significantly by age group (Table 1). Of all the GD-linked discharges in KID, 23–45% occurred in freestanding children's hospitals, compared with only 7.7% of all non-GD-linked discharges. Of the total number of discharges that took place in freestanding children's hospitals (N = 577,568), 12–33% include diagnosis codes associated with GD.

### Unexpected occurrence of xeroderma pigmentosum in an uncle and nephew… [^114fqCWa]. JAMA Network (2009). Excellent credibility.

Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below. Background Xeroderma pigmentosum is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by a decreased ability to repair DNA damaged by UV radiation and the early development of cutaneous and ocular malignant neoplasms. Approximately 20% of patients with XP also develop progressive neurologic degeneration. Observations We describe a boy who was found to have XP after a severe burn following minimal sun exposure. His maternal uncle, now age 20 years, had been diagnosed with XP after a similar sunburn in infancy. The uncle has the typical skin pigmentary findings of XP along with severe progressive neurologic involvement. Although the infant's parents were not known to be blood relatives, the infant and his affected uncle proved to be compound heterozygotes for the same 2 frameshift mutations in the XPA DNA repair gene.

Xeroderma pigmentosum is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by a decreased ability to repair DNA damaged by UV light and the subsequent early development of cutaneous and ocular malignant neoplasms. 1, 2 About 20% to 30% of patients with XP develop severe progressive neurologic. deterioration characterized by loss of reflexes, sensorineural hearing loss, ataxia, dysphagia, and decreasing cognition. 1, 3, 4 Disease-causing mutations have been identified in 8 different genes in patients with XP: 7 of these genes are involved in nucleotide excision repair, and the eighth gene, polymerase-eta, is involved in the replication of damaged DNA and is mutated in patients with the XP variant form. 2, 5–8. The overall frequency of XP is about 1 in 1 million people in Europe and the United States. 2, 6, 9 In Japan, the frequency is about 1 in 22 000.

7, 10 Mutations in the XPA gene can cause a particularly severe form of XP with progressive neurodegeneration, often starting in the second decade of life, and significant UV sensitivity such that blistering burns result from minimal sun exposure. 11 Xeroderma pigmentosum presents during infancy with or without sunburn but with the later development of often darkly pigmented lentigines. Patient 1 Patient XP360BE was a healthy first-born boy delivered at term after an uncomplicated pregnancy. His neonatal period was complicated by hyperbilirubinemia that was treated for 36 hours with blue light without complications. At age 6 weeks, he developed a sunburned face after being outside in a stroller in northern Indiana for a total of 45 minutes during a 2-day period in early April. Proband XP360BE. A, Severe facial sunburn seen at age 6 weeks.

B, At age 7 months, after beginning the regular use of effective sunlight protection, his skin shows no residual effects of the earlier sunburn. C, Computed tomographic scan of the brain at age 7 months shows moderately severe enlargement of both lateral ventricles. The parents had already begun vigorous UV protection. To consider the diagnosis of XP, blood was drawn for DNA testing; a biopsy was performed for fibroblast culture; and the patient was referred to the NIH for further evaluation. He experienced a severe sunburn on his face and upper extremities at age 6 weeks after a 20-minute sun exposure. He was hospitalized for 4 days to treat the burn. During his first year he experienced several other sunburns after minimal exposure and began developing freckling on sun-exposed skin surfaces of his face and arms. Affected uncle, patient XP363BE. A, Severe facial sunburn seen at age 6 weeks.

### Peripheral neuropathies associated with DNA repair disorders [^116zUa24]. Muscle & Nerve (2023). Medium credibility.

TABLE 1
Key features of DNA repair disorders

TABLE 2
Type of peripheral neuropathy associated with DNA repair disorders

One recent study showed that 78% of XPA patients evaluated had an axonal sensorimotor polyneuropathy, whereas 50% of XPD patients evaluated had an axonal sensory neuropathy. The investigation also showed that the development of neuropathy in XPA tended to be earlier than in XPD patients and that sensorineural hearing loss may precede abnormal nerve conduction studies in XP.

The main course of treatment for XP is prevention of complications through protective measures against UV radiation. In utero XP screening for families with a history of the disease is recommended and facilitates early implementation of sun protection measures. Regular multidisciplinary clinical evaluations that include dermatology, neurology, and ophthalmology can help capture various symptoms in the early stages and identify beneficial preventive strategies to minimize the detrimental effects of DNA damage. As of yet, there are no reports of medications that are effective for the neurological aspects of XP.

### A stop codon in xeroderma pigmentosum group C families in Turkey and Italy: molecular genetic evidence for a common ancestor [^112F9Uq7]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2001). Low credibility.

Xeroderma pigmentosum family G from Van, Turkey had two severely affected children: a son with multiple skin cancers who died at age 10 (XP67TMA), and an 8 y old daughter who began developing skin cancer before 3 y of age (XP68TMA). XP67TMA and XP68TMA cells were hypersensitive to killing by ultraviolet and the post-ultraviolet DNA repair level was 12–16% of normal. Host cell reactivation of an ultraviolet-treated reporter plasmid cotransfected with a vector expressing wild-type XPC cDNA assigned XP67TMA to xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group C. The XPC mRNA level was markedly reduced. Sequencing of the 3.5 kb XPC cDNA from XP67TMA showed a C-T mutation in XPC exon 8 at base pair 1840. This mutation converts the CGA codon of arginine at amino acid 579 to a UGA stop codon resulting in marked truncation of the 940 amino acid xeroderma pigmentosum C protein. Restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of XPC exon 8 DNA in XP67TMA and XP68TMA showed that both affected children had a homozygous mutation and that both parents had heterozygous normal and mutated sequences at the same position consistent with a history of consanguinity in the family. The mutated allele also contained two XPC single nucleotide polymorphisms. The same mutated XPC allele was reported in an Italian family. Studies of 19 microsatellite markers flanking the XPC gene on chromosome 3 suggest that the XPC allele passed between Italy and Turkey approximately 300–500 y ago. This XPC allele containing a nonsense mutation is associated with severe clinical disease with multiple skin cancers and early death.

### Novel germline ERCC5 mutations identified in a xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group G pedigree [^112dNxYb]. JAAD Case Reports (2015). Low credibility.

Novel mutations identified by whole-exome sequencing

Her overall clinical presentation was consistent with XP. We were not able to pursue functional studies to determine the complementation group and to assay the activities of DNA repair enzymes, because cell cultures were not available from the proband or her family members. Therefore, genetic testing with consent from the patient was performed to identify the etiology. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) was performed on the proband with analysis restricted to known XP genes to avoid secondary findings. In addition to the patient, the patient's parents also requested testing of themselves and their younger daughter.

WES identified 2 novel compound heterozygous mutations, c [4G > T];[697C > T] (p [Gly2Trp];[Gln233∗]) in ERCC5 (NM_000123.3) in the proband. Familial testing found that the patient inherited a nonsense point mutation c.697C > T(p.(Gln233*)) in exon 7 from her father and a missense point mutation c.4G > T(p.(Gly2Trp)) in exon 1 from her mother. Only the maternal mutation was detected in the unaffected sibling, consistent with an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern (Fig 4). Neither mutation has been seen in more than 7,800 East Asian chromosomes. The paternal nonsense mutation is predicted to lead to a truncation or absence of the protein because of nonsense-mediated decay. The maternally inherited G to T transversion at the fourth position in the cDNA is highly conserved at both DNA and amino acid levels. This variant alters the Kozak consensus sequence, which plays a major role in the initiation of the translation process. Therefore, full-length functional protein may be absent or significantly reduced. If a residual amount of the full-length protein is produced, the resulting p. Gly2Trp change is still predicted to affect protein function by multiple computational prediction tools (MutationAssessor, MutationTaster, PolyPhen-2, and SIFT). The 2 mutations occur in trans in the proband; therefore, both copies of the ERCC5 genes are affected, likely resulting in significantly reduced activity of the protein.

Management

The patient and her family were counseled regarding the patient's diagnosis and the importance of minimizing sun exposure and the use of sun-protective clothing and sun protection factor 30+ sunscreen.

### Corneal edema and opacification preferred practice pattern ® [^111X2TSE]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Corneal opacification — ICD-10 CM classifications list minor corneal opacity H17.81-, peripheral corneal opacity H17.82-, central corneal opacity H17.1-, and phthisical cornea A18.59, H44.52-. Certain ICD-10 CM categories have applicable 7th characters; the applicable 7th character is required for all codes within the category, the 7th character must always be the 7th character in the data field, and if a code that requires a 7th character is not 6 characters, a placeholder X must be used to fill in the empty characters. For bilateral sites, the final character of the codes in the ICD-10 CM indicates laterality; if no bilateral code is provided and the condition is bilateral, assign separate codes for both the left and right side, and unspecified codes should only be used when there is no other code option available. When the diagnosis code specifies laterality (i.e., 4th digit, 5th digit, or 6th digit), Right is always 1, Left is always 2, and Bilateral is always 3.

### Diagnosis of eight groups of xeroderma pigmentosum by genetic complementation using recombinant adenovirus vectors [^111StMAV]. The Journal of Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Because patients with xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) must avoid ultraviolet (UV) light from an early age, an early diagnosis of this disorder is essential. XP is composed of seven genetic complementation groups, XP-A to -G, and a variant type (XP-V). To establish an easy and accurate diagnosis of the eight disease groups, we constructed recombinant adenoviruses that expressed one of the XP cDNA. When fibroblasts derived from patients with XP-A, -B, -C, -D, -F or -G were infected with the adenovirus expressing XPA, XPB, XPC, XPD, XPF or XPG, respectively, and UV-C at 5–20 J/m 2 was irradiated, cell viability was clearly recovered by the corresponding recombinant adenoviruses. In contrast, XP-E and XP-V cells were not significantly sensitive to UV irradiation and were barely complemented by the matched recombinant adenoviruses. However, co-infection of Ad-XPA with Ad-XPE increased survival rate of XP-E cells after UV-C exposure. When XP-V cell strains, including one derived from a Japanese patient, were infected with Ad-XPV, exposed to UV-B and cultured with 1 mmol/L of caffeine, flow cytometry detected a characteristic decrease in the S phase in all the XP-V cell strains. From these results, the eight groups of XP could be differentiated by utilizing a set of recombinant adenoviruses, indicating that our procedure provides a convenient and correct diagnostic method for all the XP groups including XP-E and XP-V.

### Drug formularies in workers' compensation systems [^113QM6mH]. ACOEM (2016). Medium credibility.

Summary of ACOEM recommendations — ACOEM believes that if a workers' compensation formulary is to be established, a condition-triggered evidence-based formulary is the preferred approach; policymakers must also establish administrative processes related to UR, dispute resolution during ramp-up, assurance of non-delayed prescription fills in urgent clinical situations, robust oversight involving a P&T Committee, and careful measurement of outcome variables. ACOEM recommends that the formulary be based on well-documented evidence-based methods such as those embodied in the ACOEM Practice Guidelines and the Reed Group formulary, or in the Washington State workers' compensation formulary. ACOEM sees great merit in a condition-based formulary such as the Reed Group formulary and cautions that diagnostic categories not be made so specific as to give rise to UR disputes over the details of an ICD-9 or ICD-10 diagnostic code. ACOEM recommends that a P&T Committee, with occupational medicine physicians among its leaders, provide guidance prior to formulary implementation and oversee formulary content.

### A common genetic variant in XPD associates with risk of 5q-and 7q-deleted acute myeloid leukemia [^11594zxG]. Blood (2007). Low credibility.

Numerous structural genetic abnormalities observed in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) illustrate the heterogeneity of this disease, which likely has contributed to difficulty in identifying susceptibility alleles for AML. We previously reported that carriers of the glutamine-encoding allele at codon 751 of the xeroderma pigmentosum group D (XPD) DNA repair gene were significantly more likely to have a karyotype associated with a less favorable prognosis, and hypothesized that this observation was driven by an association between the codon 751 variant and risk of developing AML with specific structural abnormalities. Using a case series of 927 patients with AML, we show here that the XPD codon 751 glutamine-encoding variant significantly associates with risk of developing AML with a chromosome 5q deletion (odds ratio [OR] 2.09; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.14–3.81; n = 69; P = 0.02) or a chromosome 7q deletion (OR 2.27; 95% CI 1.09–4.71; n = 47; P = 0.03), but not with any other commonly recurring cytogenetic lesion.

Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) ICD-9 CM/ICD-10 CM coding — Macular degeneration, dry corresponds to ICD-9 CM 362.51 and to ICD-10 CM Nonexudative AMD H35.31-; macular degeneration, wet corresponds to ICD-9 CM 362.52 and to ICD-10 CM Exudative AMD H35.32-; macular drusen corresponds to ICD-9 CM 362.57 and to ICD-10 CM Drusen (degenerative) of macula H35.36-. AMD does not require laterality indicators. Certain ICD-10 CM categories have applicable 7th characters, the 7th character must always be the 7th character in the data field, and if a code that requires a 7th character is not 6 characters, a placeholder X must be used to fill in the empty characters. For bilateral sites, the final character of ICD-10 CM codes indicates laterality; if no bilateral code is provided and the condition is bilateral, separate codes for both the left and right side should be assigned, and unspecified codes should only be used when there is no other code option available.

### Xeroderma pigmentosum presenting as a diffuse midline glioma in a patient with skin of color [^111Yc5LN]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Case report

An 18-year-old black female presented to the emergency department with a 2-week history of headaches, nausea, and vomiting. Hearing and intellect were normal, and no other neurologic symptoms were present. Brain imaging revealed a right ventricular mass, and subsequent biopsy demonstrated a grade IV H3K27M-mutated diffuse midline glioma. The tumor was excised with the resolution of symptoms, and adjuvant chemoradiation therapy with temozolomide was completed.

At initial presentation, corneal clouding and scattered pigmentation on bilateral conjunctivae were observed. Diffuse hypopigmented macules with poikilodermatous changes throughout sun-exposed areas were also noted and had been present since early childhood with a progressive increase in size and number (Fig 1). The patient had no siblings, and there was no family history of similar skin findings. Although her unusual complexion had been followed by physicians during routine care for years, a diagnosis of freckles was made, and no further workup was initiated.

Fig 1
Poikilodermatous changes of the upper extremity.

Dermatology was consulted and provided the diagnosis of XP clinically. Sun-protective behavioral counseling was provided with close follow-up every 3 months for skin cancer surveillance.

Over the year following her diagnosis, the patient received 8 additional cycles of temozolomide monotherapy without developing new symptoms. She was also diagnosed with porokeratosis of the left distal extremity, and a squamous cell carcinoma of the chest was cleared in one stage by Mohs micrographic surgery.

Shortly thereafter, she was diagnosed with a recurrence in the left side of the thalamus after experiencing headaches and somnolence. Lomustine, bevacizumab, and carboplatin therapies were then provided over the next several months, resulting in slowed but continued disease progression. Worsening balance, coordination, and weakness in the lower portion of the left extremity led to several falls, and she required assistance in activities of daily living. She eventually became severely lethargic and experienced one seizure-like episode.

During this time, facial field treatment with 5-fluorouracil was provided but with minimal effect. A squamous cell carcinoma on the left cheek was also identified (Fig 2). However, due to the patient's poor neurologic condition, she did not undergo scheduled Mohs micrographic surgery. Palliative radiation therapy was soon administered for her glioma, and she ultimately succumbed to the disease approximately 1.5 years after her initial diagnosis.

### The rendering of human phenotype and rare diseases in ICD-11 [^1132tcAL]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2018). Low credibility.

The problem of rare diseases

Rare diseases present two problems in ICD-11: (1) sometimes appearing only in the Foundation and being below the shoreline of the MMS; and (2) raising questions as to which primary parent is most sensible in the MMS monohierarchy. Some rare diseases such as Lesch–Nyhan syndrome (5C35.01) illustrate that they keep their heads above the shoreline, though just barely with a rare six-digit code. However, while Fanconi anemia appears in the Foundation, it is relegated to a more general category: congenital aplastic anemia (3A70.0) exemplifying the first issue. Fanconi anemia does have a URI in the Foundation, which is distinct from the base-34 code in the MMS. Further, while OMIM contains 19 entries in the phenotypic series for Fanconi anemia, the ICD-11 Foundation has only a single entry. In future, we expect expansion to the etiology and genomic modifier elements, which would allow a compositional expression of these 19 genomic variants of Fanconi anemia.

Substantial debate has occurred among the developers as to whether some hematological rare diseases belonged in the clinical hematology chapter or among the inborn errors of metabolism as a rare disease. In the Foundation, of course, they can be and are in both sections. In general, the legacy of ICD-10 would be determinative, though diseases that had no ICD-11 legacy tended to favor a clinically friendly category.

To expand upon these distinctions, Zellweger syndrome is illustrated in Fig. 1, which displays the WHO ICD-11 draft browser in the MMS mode. In the left column, hierarchical concepts cascade to detailed rubrics. In this version of the draft (03 March 2018), Zellweger syndrome is an index term below the shoreline beneath its primary linearization parent, 5C37.0 Disorders of peroxisome biogenesis. Note that the assigned rubric code, 5C37.0, is temporary and can vary from draft to draft; it will finalize with publication ICD-11 in the summer of 2018. In the right panel, Zellweger is highlighted in pale yellow among a score of index terms, none of which have specific rubric codes in the MMS and are, thus, by definition, below the shoreline.

### Photosensitivity disorders in children: part II [^115DtDMY]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Photosensitivity disorders in children encompass a diverse group of diseases. Some inherited disorders manifest with photosensitivity early in life. Specific extracutaneous association may be the clue to diagnosis in this group of pediatric photodermatoses. Part II of this 2-part review covers hereditary photodermatoses caused by defects in nucleotide excision repair, double strand break repair, or localized or systemic biochemical abnormalities. Diagnosis and management of photoaggravated dermatoses are also discussed. Sun protection strategies are required in all patients with evidence of photosensitivity. Early recognition and prompt diagnosis is essential to minimize the long-term complications associated with inadequate photoprotection.

### Photodermatoses: classification, evaluation and management [^116ngBjK]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Photodermatoses are skin disorders induced or exacerbated by light. They can be broadly classified into four groups: (i) immunologically mediated photodermatoses (idioapathic); (ii) drug- and chemical-induced photosensitivity; (iii) defective DNA repair disorders; and (iv) photoaggravated dermatoses. The exact pathomechanism of those diverse skin reactions to light radiation remains unclear. Immunologically mediated photodermatoses are the most common dermatoses among all photosesnsitive disorders. The management of photodermatoses starts with clinical recognition of characteristic lesions localized predominantly in light exposed skin. Detailed history-taking, phototesting and photopatch testing are required to establish a correct diagnosis, especially if patients present in disease-free intervals. Classification and short description of distinctive clinical features of most common photodermatoses, several practical aspects of evaluation and management of the patient with photosensitivity will be outlined.

Symptoms appear early, making the disease more common in children. The extreme photosensitivity of skin to UV-R makes it prone to damage with minimal exposure (Fig. 2). This may manifest as abnormal skin pigmentation, including freckles and lentigines, blistering and persistent erythema (less severe in groups XPC, XPE and XPV). Over time, sun-exposed areas of the skin develop actinic damage, increasing the risk of developing skin malignancies at early ages. While the high risk of patients with XP to develop keratinocyte carcinoma is well known, few studies have looked at the incidence of KAs in patients with XP. XPC function loss was found in tumoral cells of KAs. A 2010 study showed that 15 of 29 sporadic KAs have loss of XPC expression, suggesting that dysfunction of the XPC protein increases risk of UV-induced KAs. Another study reported the presence of KAs in 20.4% patients with XPV. Zheng et al. describe the youngest reported case, an 18-month-old patient with XP associating a KA. Typical KA localizations in patients with XP are on sun-exposed areas, mainly the head and neck, measuring up to 3 cm and varying in number (in one case, 11 lesions were identified).

Although XP diagnosis may be suggested by the clinical history of the patient and physical findings, it can be confirmed by either unscheduled DNA synthesis techniques with cultured fibroblasts or by gene sequencing. Unscheduled DNA synthesis on cultured amniotic fluid cells or gene sequencing on chorionic villus cells or amniotic fluid cells can also confirm a prenatal diagnosis.

### Use of big data to estimate prevalence of defective DNA repair variants in the US population [^115cG5Fd]. JAMA Dermatology (2019). High credibility.

Importance

Wide use of genomic sequencing to diagnose disease has raised concern about the extent of genotype-phenotype correlations.

Objective

To correlate disease-associated allele frequencies with expected and reported prevalence of clinical disease.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP), a recessive, cancer-prone, neurocutaneous disorder, was used as a model for this study. From January 1, 2017, to May 4, 2018, the Human Gene Mutation Database and a cohort of patients at the National Institutes of Health were searched and screened to identify reported mutations associated with XP. The clinical phenotype of these patients was confirmed from reports in the literature and National Institutes of Health medical records. The genetically predicted prevalence of disease based on frequency of known pathogenic mutations was compared with the prevalence of patients clinically diagnosed with phenotypic XP. Exome sequencing of more than 200 000 alleles from the Genome Aggregation Database, the National Cancer Institute Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics database of healthy controls, and an Inova Hospital Study database was used to investigate the frequencies of these mutations in the general population.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Listing of all reported mutations associated with XP, their frequencies in 3 large exome sequence databases, determination of the number of patients in the United States with XP using modeling equations, and comparison of the observed and reported numbers of patients with XP with specific mutations.

Results

A total of 156 pathogenic missense and nonsense mutations associated with XP were identified in the National Institutes of Health cohort and the Human Gene Mutation Database. The Genome Aggregation Database provided frequency data for 65 of these mutations, with a total allele frequency of 1.13%. The XPF (ERCC4) mutation, p.P379S, had an allele frequency of 0.4%, and the XPC mutation, p.P334H, had an allele frequency of 0.3%. With the Hardy-Weinberg equation, it was determined that there should be more than 8000 patients who are homozygous for these mutations in the United States. In contrast, only 3 patients with XP were reported as having the XPF mutation, and 1 patient was reported as having the XPC mutation.

Conclusions and Relevance

The findings from this study suggest that clinicians should approach large genomic databases with caution when trying to correlate the clinical implications of genetic variants with the prevalence of disease risk. Unsuspected mutations in known genes with a predisposition for skin cancer may be responsible for some of the high frequency of skin cancers in the general population.

### Importance of proper utilization of international classification of Diseases 10th revision and clinical documentation in modern payment models [^116FM4wi]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Health care payment models are changing rapidly, and the measurement of outcomes and costs is increasing.

Methods

With the implementation of International Classification of Diseases 10th revision (ICD-10) codes, providers now have the ability to introduce a precise array of diagnoses for their patients.

Results

More specific diagnostic codes do not eliminate the potential for vague application, as was seen with the utility of ICD-9. Complete, accurate, and consistent data that reflect the risk, severity, and complexity of care are becoming critically important in this new environment. Orthopedic specialty organizations must be actively involved in influencing the definition of value and risk in the patient population.

Conclusion

Now is the time to use the ICD-10 diagnostic codes to improve the management of patient conditions in data.

### Genotype-phenotype correlation of xeroderma pigmentosum in a Chinese han population [^112cxTHe]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by extreme sensitivity to sunlight, freckle-like pigmentation and a greatly increased incidence of skin cancers. Genetic mutation detection and genotype-phenotype analysis of XP are rarely reported in the Chinese Han population.

Objectives

To investigate the mutational spectrum of XP in a Chinese Han population, to discover any genotype-phenotype correlation and, consequently, to propose a simple and effective tool for the molecular diagnosis of XP.

Methods

This study was carried out on 12 unrelated Chinese families that included 13 patients with clinically suspected XP. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood samples. Mutation screening was performed by direct sequencing of exons and flanking intron-exon boundaries for the entire coding region of eight XP genes.

Results

In 12 patients, direct sequencing of the whole coding region of eight XP genes revealed pathogenic mutations, including seven compound heterozygous mutations, three homozygous mutations and a Japanese founder mutation. Thirteen mutations have not been previously identified. This cohort was composed of four patients with XP-C (XPC), two with XP-G (ERCC5), three with XP-A (XPA) and three with XP-V (POLH).

Conclusions

This study identified 13 novel mutations and extended the mutation spectrum of XP in the Chinese Han population. In this cohort, we found that patients with XP-G have no neurological symptoms, and patients with XP-A and XP-V have a high incidence of malignancy. Furthermore, lack of stringent protection against sunlight, late diagnosis and long duration of disease play an important role.

### Pathway to acquire new ICD-10 codes pertinent to new wound care technology [^114SpFAv]. Advances in Wound Care (2018). Low credibility.

New technologies are continually developed for the wound care market. This article provides an overview of the process for obtaining a new or revised ICD-10-Clinical Modification and/or ICD-10-Procedure Coding System code. Manufacturers, providers and researchers often forget that this process can be lengthy and must be included in product development timelines. An example of timelines required for implementation of new 2020 ICD-10 codes is provided in the article. In addition, the article provides insight into the appropriate individuals, within a manufacturing organization or consulting firm, who may be able to assist with evaluating whether pertinent ICD-10 diagnosis or procedure codes exist within the ICD-10 coding system or whether an application must be submitted for one or more new/revised ICD-10 codes.

### International classification of disease coding for obstructive lung disease: does it reflect appropriate clinical documentation? [^112dTi7a]. Chest (2010). Low credibility.

International Classification of Disease coding is widely used by physicians, hospitals, health-care payers, and governments to assess the health of populations and as a means of reimbursement for medical care based on diagnosis and severity of illness. The current classification system, International Classification of Diseases, 9th ed (ICD-9), will soon be replaced by International Classification of Diseases, 10th ed (ICD-10). When the codes that relate to COPD and asthma are examined, the clinical relevance of the categories in International Classification of Disease coding must be questioned. In the future, a more simplified terminology that is consistent with clinical usage could improve accuracy and ease of coding. At present, however, clinicians should become familiar with the present ICD-9 and future ICD-10 codes so that their descriptions of illnesses in the medical records more accurately reflect current coding terminology.

### Invasive basal cell carcinoma in a xeroderma pigmentosum patient: facing secondary and tertiary aggressive recurrences [^114EmFJ2]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) is characterized by photohypersensitivity of sun-exposed tissues and several thousand-fold increased risk of developing malignant neoplasms of the skin and eyes. Inherited molecular defects in nucleotide excision repair genes cause the autosomal recessive condition XP. A 56-year-old woman with XP presented with an extensive multirecurrence basal cell carcinoma in the left naso-orbital region. At the time of the first visit, the patient had already received several interventions with local reconstructive techniques, a full course of radiotherapy, and bilateral neck dissection. A large tumor resection and free flap reconstruction were performed. Three years 9 months afterward, an aggressive recurrence occurred, and a second resection was needed. A new free flap was transferred, and microvascular anastomoses were done to the pedicle of the previously transferred flap. Nine months later, the patient returned with frontal bone tumoral lesions, and third microsurgical intervention was done. At that time, the reconstruction was practiced by a composite chimeric flap with a rib portion. Its pedicle was anastomosed to the one of the second free flaps. The objective of this article was to report the authors' experience concerning a unique case of XP requiring a complex reconstruction of the anterior skull base. Xeroderma pigmentosum patients need an early diagnosis and removal of cutaneous tumor lesions as some of them behave aggressively, especially those affecting the face. Free flaps are good solutions for reconstruction and should proceed from non-sun-exposed areas of the body. If reconstructed areas are highly radiated and/or skin tumors affect deep anatomical areas, complications are frequent.

### The diagnostic trajectory of infants and children with clinical features of genetic disease [^111K9Jy8]. NPJ Genomic Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

By definition, ICD-9/10 codes are intended to classify diseases or conditions; thus, some ICD-9/10 codes definitively identify specific genetic diseases whereas others indicate clinical presentations that may be an accepted indication to test for a genetic disease. As such, as described previously, ICD-9/10 codes were first categorized into three sets: (1) definite genetic disease; (2) probable genetic disease; and (3) possible genetic disease. The definite category was defined by ICD-9/10 codes that identify specific genetic diseases (e.g. cystic fibrosis, Down syndrome, specific inborn errors of metabolism). Probable genetic diseases were defined as ICD-9/10 codes that describe clinical presentations wherein a genetic etiology is likely to be achieved with appropriate genetic testing in > 30% of patients with these codes (e.g. neonatal intractable epilepsy). Finally, possible genetic diseases were defined as ICD-9/10 codes that describe clinical presentations wherein a genetic etiology is likely to be achieved with appropriate testing in ~10–30% of patients (e.g. most severe birth defects, such as congenital central nervous system, and cardiac malformations). We further identified ICD-9/10 codes where there are established and specific clinical and/or laboratory diagnostic criteria and availability of established and commonly administered targeted diagnostic tests (e.g. cystic fibrosis, sickle cell disorders, neurofibromatosis), and therefore patients with these codes would be less likely to present clinically as an undiagnosed genetic disease. CPT and HCPCS codes were categorized into two categories: (1) genetic tests (e.g. specific single-gene tests, molecular pathology, chromosomal microarray (CMA), ES); and (2) other procedures that are commonly used in the workup of patients with suspected genetic diseases (e.g. electrophysiologic tests, imaging, skin or muscle biopsies, etc), though we acknowledge this second category includes codes that are not specific to the workup of patients with suspected genetic diseases.

We used combinations of this curated code sets to group patients into three non-mutually exclusive cohorts for analysis [a complete list of codes and the algorithms for identifying each cohort (Supplementary Information) and an attrition table (Supplementary Table 1) can be found in the Supplementary Information].

### The collective impact of rare diseases in Western Australia: an estimate using a population-based cohort [^111FM788]. Genetics in Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Materials and Methods

RD resource set

As a result of the limitations of using Orpha codes in the Australian context, it was necessary to undertake work to first match Orpha/ICD-10 codes to ICD-10-AM codes and validate the matching process. We have named the outcome of this work the RD resource set.

Because the cohort for the study was to be selected from the WA HMDC, we used information from this data collection to assist with the creation of the RD resource set. When developing the resource set, an RD was defined as any noninfectious disease with a prevalence of less than 1 in 2,000 in the general WA population.

We started with 585 RD Orpha codes identified by Orphanet and specifically mapped to one or a set of ICD-10 codes. With guidance from clinical coders, these ICD-10 codes were matched to their equivalent ICD-10-AM codes. A process of "back translation" to Orpha codes was then undertaken to ensure that the ICD-10-AM codes described the same diseases as those captured by the Orpha codes. In some cases, because of discrepancies between the ICD-10 and ICD-10-AM coding systems, the ICD-10-AM code(s) that specifically corresponded to an Orpha code was different from the ICD-10 code provided by Orphanet. Decisions regarding how to assign ICD-10-AM codes for these diseases were made in conjunction with WA medical coding experts.

### Relationship of neurologic degeneration to genotype in three xeroderma pigmentosum group G patients [^111nf286]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2002). Low credibility.

We studied three newly diagnosed xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group G patients with markedly different clinical features. An Israeli-Palestinian girl (XP96TA) had severe abnormalities suggestive of the xeroderma pigmentosum/Cockayne syndrome complex including sun sensitivity, neurologic and developmental impairment, and death by age 6 y. A Caucasian girl (XP82DC) also had severe sun sensitivity with neurologic and developmental impairment and died at 5.8 y. In contrast, a mildly affected 14-y-old Caucasian female (XP65BE) had sun sensitivity but no neurologic abnormalities. XP96TA, XP82DC, and XP65BE fibroblasts showed marked reductions in post-ultraviolet cell survival and DNA repair but these were higher in XP65BE than in XP82DC. XP96TA fibroblasts had very low XPG mRNA expression levels whereas XP65BE fibroblasts had nearly normal levels. Host cell reactivation of an ultraviolet-treated reporter assigned all three fibroblast strains to the rare xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group G (only 10 other patients previously reported). XP96TA and XP82DC cells had mutations in both XPG alleles that are predicted to result in severely truncated proteins including stop codons and two base frameshifts. The mild XP65BE patient had an early stop codon mutation in the paternal allele. The XP65BE maternal allele had a single base missense mutation (G2817A, Ala874Thr) that showed residual ability to complement xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group G cells. These observations agree with earlier studies demonstrating that XPG mutations, which are predicted to lead to severely truncated proteins in both alleles, were associated with severe xeroderma pigmentosum/Cockayne syndrome neurologic symptoms. Retaining residual functional activity in one allele was associated with mild clinical features without neurologic abnormalities.
