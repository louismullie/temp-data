## Question

Pharmacological management of diabetic neuropathy

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the pharmacological management of diabetic neuropathy, preserving the thinking process and self-verification style. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying the clinical entity and scope, including painful versus non-painful DPN and the distinction between disease modification and symptom control. Then, I should verify foundational disease-modifying strategies, especially glycemic and cardiometabolic risk control. Next, I will review first-line pharmacologic options for neuropathic pain, followed by second-line and topical therapies. After that, I need to check the stance on opioids and tramadol/tapentadol, including any conflicting guidance. I will then examine combination therapy, non-pharmacologic options, and special populations. Finally, I should confirm monitoring, safety, and counseling points, and close with a concise, guideline-aligned algorithm and a brief synthesis of the evidence base.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entity and scope so I don't conflate terms. Diabetic neuropathy encompasses distal symmetric polyneuropathy, autonomic neuropathy, and focal neuropathies, but the pharmacologic focus here is on painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy, which affects roughly 20–30% of people with diabetes and is typically managed symptomatically because there are no approved disease-modifying drugs for DPN in the US, although optimizing glycemia slows progression, particularly in type 1 diabetes [^1129yJmM] [^114Yregc] [^115LHpiU] [^112tU71u].

> Wait, let me verify the foundational disease-modifying strategy before jumping to pain drugs. Across guidelines, optimizing glycemic control is the only consistently effective disease-modifying approach, with stronger prevention benefits in type 1 diabetes and more modest effects in type 2 diabetes, where broader cardiometabolic risk control (blood pressure, lipids, weight) also matters; importantly, there is no compelling evidence that glycemic or lifestyle management alone treats established neuropathic pain, so pharmacotherapy remains necessary for symptom control [^115LHpiU] [^111xb6us] [^1179GrXK].

> Next, I should review first-line pharmacologic options for painful DPN and ensure I'm aligning with high-credibility guidance. The AAN 2022 guideline recommends offering TCAs, SNRIs, gabapentinoids, and/or sodium channel blockers to reduce pain, noting comparable effect sizes across classes, which supports choosing based on comorbidities, tolerability, cost, and patient preference; ADA 2025 similarly lists gabapentinoids, SNRIs, TCAs, and sodium channel blockers as initial options, and AAFP 2024 highlights duloxetine or pregabalin as preferred first-line agents, with amitriptyline and gabapentin as alternatives given adverse effect profiles [^114D4kum] [^113gWvDY] [^1168nP2x] [^116ji9na].

> Hold on, I should verify the practical selection within these classes. For SNRIs, duloxetine is FDA-approved and commonly favored; for gabapentinoids, pregabalin and gabapentin are both guideline-supported; for TCAs, amitriptyline has the most evidence but nortriptyline or desipramine are often better tolerated in older adults; for sodium channel blockers, options include carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, and lacosamide, though evidence varies and selection should be individualized [^112MXFZq] [^114D4kum] [^1114jxoe].

> I will now examine second-line and topical options, but I need to ensure I don't overstate their role. Topical lidocaine and the capsaicin 8% topical system are reasonable next-line choices, with capsaicin 8% now FDA-approved and positioned as first-line in some guidelines; topical therapy can be particularly useful for patients with contraindications to oral agents or a preference to avoid systemic adverse effects, and AAN suggests considering topical options when patients prefer them [^112MXFZq] [^113XCGtW] [^1135RFSa] [^111Zn41Z].

> But wait, what about opioids and dual-mechanism agents like tramadol or tapentadol; I should double-check the current consensus. The AAN 2022 guideline advises against starting opioids for painful DPN and recommends offering a safe taper for those already on them; ADA 2025 similarly recommends not using opioids, including tramadol and tapentadol, for neuropathic pain in diabetes; AAFP 2024 also advises avoiding opioids and opioid/SNRI combinations due to serious adverse events and the availability of safer effective options, despite FDA approval of tapentadol ER for painful DPN [^112bymCr] [^117Sc3X7] [^112fh99y] [^112MXFZq].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought tramadol might be acceptable as a short-term rescue given older EFNS guidance that allowed tramadol as second-line in select contexts; hold on, I should verify the timing and context. That EFNS 2010 recommendation predates contemporary US guidance and reflects a different risk–benefit era; current US guidelines uniformly discourage opioid initiation for DPN, so I should correct that earlier inclination and align with AAN and ADA recommendations to avoid opioids in this setting [^114sFpnW] [^112bymCr] [^117Sc3X7].

> Next, I should review combination therapy and make sure I don't overgeneralize. AAN supports switching to a different class if monotherapy fails and suggests that adding a second agent from a different class may help when there is partial response; however, high-quality evidence for combination therapy is limited, with one study showing no superiority of duloxetine plus pregabalin over optimized monotherapy, so combinations should be used judiciously and monitored closely [^111giWQS] [^112dCQTK] [^111gLXN2].

> I need to ensure I cover non-pharmacologic options for refractory cases and clarify their evidentiary status. Spinal cord stimulation has FDA clearance for chronic intractable painful DPN and can be considered after failure of at least one medication, with supportive RCT data for high-frequency SCS; TENS and exercise have low-to-moderate quality evidence and may provide modest benefit; these modalities should be integrated within a multidisciplinary plan rather than used in isolation [^112MXFZq] [^116okBMY] [^114pHkgo].

> Let me consider special populations and comorbidity-driven selection so I don't miss safety issues. In older adults, I should preferentially avoid anticholinergic TCAs and consider nortriptyline or desipramine if a TCA is needed; in patients with renal impairment, dose-adjust gabapentinoids; in those with cardiovascular disease or orthostasis, avoid TCAs; in patients with depression or anxiety, SNRIs may be advantageous; pregnancy and severe hepatic disease require individualized risk–benefit discussions and often favor non-opioid, non-TCA strategies [^1114jxoe] [^114D4kum].

> I should confirm monitoring, safety, and counseling so expectations are realistic. AAN recommends assessing pain and its impact on function and quality of life, counseling that the goal is meaningful pain reduction rather than elimination, and treating coexisting mood and sleep disorders; a pragmatic trial of about 12 weeks at an effective dose is reasonable before declaring failure, and clinicians should reassess adverse effects, adherence, and functional outcomes at each visit [^111m3RdG] [^112dCQTK] [^116PU6Qu].

> Let me synthesize a concise, guideline-aligned algorithm, but I will keep verifying each step against sources. Start with optimization of glycemic, blood pressure, and lipid control as disease-modifying measures; for painful symptoms, initiate one first-line agent from TCAs, SNRIs, gabapentinoids, or sodium channel blockers, tailoring to comorbidities and preferences; if there is inadequate response after an adequate trial, switch to a different class or consider adding a second agent from a different class; reserve topical options such as capsaicin 8% or lidocaine for patients who cannot tolerate or prefer to avoid oral therapy; avoid initiating opioids; for refractory pain despite multiple optimized trials, consider referral for spinal cord stimulation or other neuromodulation within a multidisciplinary framework [^1168nP2x] [^114D4kum] [^112MXFZq] [^112bymCr].

> Finally, I should review the evidentiary foundation to ensure the hierarchy is justified. High-credibility guidance from AAN and ADA consistently supports four oral classes with comparable effect sizes for pain reduction, FDA approvals exist for duloxetine, pregabalin, tapentadol ER, and the capsaicin 8% topical system, and systematic reviews corroborate benefit for antidepressants and anticonvulsants while highlighting the need for longer-term and comparative effectiveness data; this aligns with the practical approach of individualized, stepwise therapy rather than a rigid sequence [^114D4kum] [^113gWvDY] [^112MXFZq] [^111FBs79].

---

The pharmacological management of diabetic neuropathy centers on **first-line agents** (gabapentin, pregabalin, duloxetine, amitriptyline) [^1168nP2x] [^114D4kum] and **topical capsaicin** for patients who prefer local therapy or cannot tolerate oral drugs [^1135RFSa] [^112MXFZq]. If pain persists, **second-line options** include venlafaxine, carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, lamotrigine, or tramadol (short-term only) [^112ThFLs] [^116zn7xX]. Tapentadol ER is FDA-approved for DPN but should be reserved for refractory cases due to opioid risks [^112MXFZq] [^116zn7xX]. Combination therapy from different classes may be used for partial responders, and opioids are generally avoided because of safety concerns [^111giWQS] [^112bymCr]. Treatment should be individualized based on comorbidities, side effects, and patient preference, with regular reassessment of efficacy and tolerability [^1159BCr1] [^112dCQTK].

## First-line pharmacological treatments

### Gabapentinoids

Key characteristics of gabapentinoids:

| **Aspect** | **Gabapentin** | **Pregabalin** |
|-|-|-|
| Indication and regulatory status | Effective for DPN [^113gWvDY] [^114kcF7u] | Effective and FDA-approved for DPN [^113gWvDY] [^114kcF7u] |
| Starting dose | start 300 mg at bedtime [^113gWvDY] [^114kcF7u] | start 50 mg TID [^113gWvDY] [^114kcF7u] |
| Titration and target dose | titrate to 1800–3600 mg/day [^113gWvDY] [^114kcF7u] | titrate to 300 mg/day [^113gWvDY] [^114kcF7u] |
| Adverse effects | common adverse effects include dizziness, somnolence, and peripheral edema [^113gWvDY] [^114kcF7u] | adverse effects include dizziness, somnolence, weight gain, and peripheral edema [^113gWvDY] [^114kcF7u] |

---

### Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)

Among SNRIs, **duloxetine** is effective and FDA-approved for DPN; start 30 mg daily and titrate to 60 mg daily; adverse effects include nausea, somnolence, and dizziness [^115orcyg] [^114kcF7u]. Venlafaxine is also effective; start 37.5 mg daily and titrate to 150–225 mg/day; monitor for hypertension and withdrawal symptoms [^112ThFLs].

---

### Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs)

Among TCAs, **amitriptyline** is effective; start 10–25 mg at bedtime and titrate to 75–150 mg/day; adverse effects include anticholinergic effects, orthostatic hypotension, and cardiac arrhythmias [^113gWvDY] [^1114jxoe]. Nortriptyline is an alternative with a somewhat better tolerability profile than amitriptyline [^1114jxoe].

---

### Topical agents

Capsaicin 8% patch is FDA-approved and effective; apply in clinic every 3 months; local burning and erythema are common but usually transient [^117HLAfx] [^112MXFZq]. Topical lidocaine 5% is an alternative for localized pain; apply up to three patches daily; monitor for skin irritation [^111Zn41Z].

---

## Second-line pharmacological treatments

Second-line options include **anticonvulsants** such as carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, and lamotrigine, which may be considered when first-line agents are ineffective or not tolerated [^114pHkgo] [^114sa8mt] [^111giWQS]. Tramadol may be used short-term for severe pain unresponsive to other therapies, but long-term use is discouraged due to dependence and misuse risks [^116zn7xX]. Tapentadol ER is FDA-approved for DPN but should be reserved for refractory cases because of opioid-related risks [^112MXFZq] [^117Sc3X7].

---

## Combination therapy

Combination therapy from different classes may be considered for partial responders; for example, duloxetine plus pregabalin or gabapentin plus an SNRI may provide additive benefit, though evidence is limited and adverse effects may increase [^111giWQS] [^111gLXN2].

---

## Medications to avoid or use with caution

Avoid **opioids** — including tramadol and tapentadol — for chronic DPN because of dependence, misuse, and overdose risks; consider only for short-term use in refractory cases [^112bymCr] [^117Sc3X7]. Use **TCAs** cautiously in elderly patients or those with cardiac disease because of anticholinergic and proarrhythmic effects [^1114jxoe].

---

## Emerging therapies and investigational drugs

- **SGLT2 inhibitors**: Under investigation for potential neuroprotective effects in DPN [^113uT2fU].

- **Neuromodulation**: Spinal cord stimulation and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) are emerging non-pharmacologic options for refractory DPN [^112MXFZq] [^114pHkgo].

- **Alpha-lipoic acid**: An antioxidant that may improve neuropathic symptoms; evidence is mixed and not universally recommended [^117KW4ne] [^114pHkgo].

---

## Patient-specific considerations

- **Comorbidities**: Tailor medication choice to renal function, cardiovascular disease, depression, and anxiety [^1159BCr1].

- **Adverse effects**: Consider tolerability profiles, especially in elderly patients [^1114jxoe].

- **Patient preference**: Involve patients in decision-making to improve adherence and satisfaction [^112ewY4c].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regularly assess **pain reduction, functional improvement, and adverse effects**, typically every 4–12 weeks [^112dCQTK]. Titrate to effect or until limited by adverse effects, and switch or add agents if goals are not met [^112dCQTK]. Provide education on medication adherence, side effects, and when to seek medical attention [^notfound].

---

The pharmacological management of diabetic neuropathy is individualized, with **first-line agents** (gabapentin, pregabalin, duloxetine, amitriptyline, and topical capsaicin) providing the foundation. Second-line options and combination therapy are reserved for refractory cases, and opioids are generally avoided because of safety concerns.

Guidelines for Managing Painful Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy (DPN)

The management of painful DPN involves controlling the underlying diabetic condition and symptomatically treating the associated pain, as recommended in multiple clinical practice guidelines and expert reviews. Given their influence and importance in determining recommendations in other relevant expert opinions and reviews, we have focused on evidence-based guidelines and recommended treatment algorithms from the following US organizations:
American Academy of Neurology (AAN): Published in December 2021, the Oral and Topical Treatment of Painful Diabetic Neuropathy: Practice Guideline Update Summaryprovides updated recommendations on the treatment of painful DPN. Graded recommendations for the use of numerous drug classes and individual agents are based on a systematic and statistical analysis of the results of 133 relevant peer-reviewed randomized, controlled trials (RCTs).
American Diabetes Association (ADA): Three publications guiding the treatment of painful DPN are available from the ADA. Diabetic Neuropathy: A Position Statementwas published in 2017 and provides graded recommendations on all aspects of DPN management — including prevention, diagnosis, and treatment — based on several technical reviews and associated supporting references. The clinical compendium on the Diagnosis and Treatment of Painful Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathyand Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes‒2022, were published in 2022. The clinical compendium focuses on the screening, diagnosis and treatment of painful DPN in routine clinical practice, and summarizes the latest guidance on effective therapies, including pharmacological agents, nutraceutical products, and non-pharmacological therapies. Guidance on treating painful DPN is also provided in Chapter 12: Retinopathy, Neuropathy, and Foot Careof the updated Standard of Medical Care in Diabetes ‒2022.
American Association of Clinical Endocrinology (AACE). Published in 2022, the AACE Clinical Practice Guideline: Developing a Diabetes Mellitus Comprehensive Care Plan‒2022 Updateprovides graded recommendations for the care of diabetic patients, including diagnosis and management of DPN, based on a comprehensive search and appraisal of the current literature.

### Painful diabetic neuropathy: advantage of novel drugs over old drugs? [^1148yuhx]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

SYMPTOMATIC PHARMACOLOGICAL TREATMENT OF PAINFUL NEUROPATHY

Diabetic painful neuropathy may constitute a considerable management problem. The efficacy of a single therapeutic agent is not the rule, and simple analgesics are usually inadequate to control the pain. Therefore, various therapeutic schemes have been previously proposed, but none have been validated. Nonetheless, there is agreement that patients should be offered the available therapies in a stepwise fashion. Effective pain treatment consists of a favorable balance between pain relief and adverse events without implying a maximum effect.

The various pharmacological treatment options are summarized in Table 1. The advantages and disadvantages of the various drugs and drug classes used for treatment of DPN under consideration of the various comorbidities and complications associated with diabetes are summarized in Table 2. Before any decision regarding the appropriate treatment, the diagnosis of the underlying neuropathic manifestation should be established. In contrast to the agents that have been derived from the pathogenetic mechanisms of diabetic neuropathy, those used for symptomatic therapy were designed to modulate the pain, without favorably influencing the underlying neuropathy. A number of trials have been conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of these drugs, but only a few included large patient samples.

Pharmacological treatment options for painful neuropathy

Table 2
Treatment of painful neuropathy under consideration of comorbidities, side effects, and drug metabolism

The relative benefit of active treatment over a control in clinical trials is usually expressed as the relative risk, the relative risk reduction, or the odds ratio. However, to estimate the extent of a therapeutic effect (i.e. pain relief) that can be translated into clinical practice, it is useful to apply a simple measure that helps the physician to select the appropriate treatment for the individual patient. Such a practical measure is the "number needed to treat" (NNT), i.e. the number of patients who need to be treated with a particular therapy to observe a clinically relevant effect or adverse event in one patient. The NNTs and numbers needed to harm for the individual agents used in the treatment of DPN are given in Table 1.

Conclusion

Painful DPN, a highly prevalent and disabling complication of diabetes, impacts negatively on patient function and HR-QoL and is associated with significant morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs. A variety of pharmacological and non-pharmacological options are available to treat painful DPN which may be combined as part of an individualized, comprehensive pain management plan. Healthcare providers are encouraged to increase their familiarity with the available options and to incorporate a comprehensive understanding of the clinical evidence substantiating their efficacy. In recognition of the needs of this fast-growing segment of the diabetic population, research into painful DPN has become increasingly active. Numerous studies are underway evaluating drugs with novel mechanisms of action and various noninvasive electrical stimulation devices. Beyond providing more effective pain relief, identifying disease-modifying interventions that can prevent or reverse the nerve damage associated with DPN should be a research priority. Pharmacoeconomic evaluations should be conducted to determine whether the enormous healthcare burden associated with painful DPN might be mitigated to some extent through the use of modern treatments with greater efficacy and improved tolerability relative to conventional oral agents, despite their higher acquisition costs.

Unmet Needs in the Treatment of Painful DPN

Unmet needs with regard to the treatment of painful DPN can be categorized at three levels, which should form the basis for a personalized approach to the management of this frequently debilitating and progressive condition.
In the absence of any approved effective pharmacological disease-modifying therapy, preventative approaches that delay the development of nerve damage and slow disease progression would be highly beneficial. This should involve educating healthcare professionals and patients about diabetes and DPN, implementing effective targeted screening strategies as part of routine clinical practice, encouraging patients to undertake lifestyle modifications, and optimizing the use of medications. Early diagnosis and timely treatment of painful DPN is vital to prevent progression, avoid the development of advanced complications, and improve HR-QoL, economic and other outcomes.
A vital goal should be to develop pathogenetically oriented disease-modifying treatments designed to prevent/reverse the nerve damage associated with painful DPN.
Since approximately 30% of patients with DPN experience painful episodes, optimal approaches to minimize pain are an essential goal for a relevant proportion of patients.

Disease Prevention

To ensure that DPN is diagnosed and managed as early as possible, screening for DPN should be conducted regularly and routinely in all diabetic patients (Table 1). Healthcare professionals should be educated in patient assessment, which involves obtaining a careful clinical history and conducting a targeted physical exam. A patient-centered approach may require referral to specialists in other disciplines including but not limited to endocrinology, pain management, and podiatry. Patients should also be educated about the risk of DPN and its early signs and symptoms.

Management decisions pertaining to DPN prevention should be individualized to the patient's needs. These include appropriate foot care and a range of initiatives to reduce DPN risk factors. To prevent the onset of DPN in patients with T1D, intensive glucose control should be implemented when possible. In patients with T2D, controlling features of the metabolic syndrome, such as hyperglycemia, hypertension and hyperlipidemia, together with educational strategies to improve lifestyle measures, including weight loss, increased physical activity, and smoking cessation, are recommended to prevent DPN. Education about lifestyle interventions is also important to prevent DPN in individuals with prediabetes/metabolic syndrome.

### What role for capsaicin in diabetic peripheral neuropathy? [^114ULFNS]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2016). Low credibility.

Peripheral neuropathy is a common long-term complication of diabetes mellitus. In many patients, neuropathy is accompanied by pain, which is often difficult to manage effectively. Drug treatment options include certain antidepressants and antiepileptic drugs. Another option is the use of topical capsaicin. In this article, we consider the evidence for capsaicin in the management of diabetic peripheral neuropathy and how it fits with current management strategies.

### Novel insights on diagnosis, cause and treatment of diabetic neuropathy: focus on painful diabetic neuropathy [^114GWyPv]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2010). Low credibility.

Diabetic neuropathy is common, under or misdiagnosed, and causes substantial morbidity with increased mortality. Defining and developing sensitive diagnostic tests for diabetic neuropathy is not only key to implementing earlier interventions but also to ensure that the most appropriate endpoints are employed in clinical intervention trials. This is critical as many potentially effective therapies may never progress to the clinic, not due to a lack of therapeutic effect, but because the endpoints were not sufficiently sensitive or robust to identify benefit. Apart from improving glycaemic control, there is no licensed treatment for diabetic neuropathy, however, a number of pathogenetic pathways remain under active study. Painful diabetic neuropathy is a cause of considerable morbidity and whilst many pharmacological and nonpharmacological interventions are currently used, only two are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. We address the important issue of the 'placebo effect' and also consider potential new pharmacological therapies as well as nonpharmacological interventions in the treatment of painful diabetic neuropathy.

### The conundrum of diabetic neuropathies-past, present, and future [^116g1cn4]. Journal of Diabetes and Its Complications (2022). Medium credibility.

Diabetic neuropathy (DN) remains arguably the most prevalent chronic complication in people with both type 1 and type 2 diabetes, including in youth, despite changes in the current standards of clinical care. Additionally, emerging evidence demonstrates that neuropathy affects a large proportion of people with undiagnosed diabetes and/or prediabetes, as well as those with obesity. Here we summarize the latest epidemiology of DN, recent findings regarding the pathophysiology of the disease, as well as current outcome measures for screening and diagnosis, in research and clinical settings. The authors discuss novel perspectives on the impact of social determinants of health in DN development and management, and the latest evidence on effective therapies, including pharmacological and nonpharmacological therapies for neuropathic pain. Throughout the publication, we identify knowledge gaps and the need for future funding to address these gaps, as well as needs to advocate for a personalized care approach to reduce the burden of DN and optimize quality of life for all affected individuals.

### Update on treating painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy: a review of current US guidelines with a focus on the most recently approved management options [^1143qxYs]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

The pathogenesis of pain related to DPN is not fully understood, although several theories have been proposed. These include changes in blood vessels that supply the peripheral nerves; metabolic and autoimmune disorders accompanied by glial cell activation; alterations in sodium and calcium channel expression; and, more recently, central pain mechanisms, such as increased thalamic vascularity and imbalance of the facilitatory/inhibitory descending pathways.

The management of painful DPN involves treating the underlying causes via lifestyle modifications and pharmacological control of risk factors, targeting its pathogenesis, and providing symptomatic pain relief, thereby improving patient function and health-related quality of life (HR-QoL). Despite the substantial morbidity of painful DPN, its negative impact on HR-QoL, and immense healthcare burden, the condition is often misdiagnosed and inadequately treated.

Since 2020, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved two novel options to manage painful DPN, namely the capsaicin 8% topical system and spinal cord stimulation devices. As such, we considered it timely to examine the evidence supporting the use of these newer options and their positioning within current US guidelines. We also present evidence for three FDA-approved oral pharmacological treatments and other guideline-supported oral treatments commonly used as first-line options in clinical practice; explore potential future options to manage painful DPN; and discuss the unmet needs of this increasingly complex and rapidly growing patient population.

### Clinical approach to the treatment of painful diabetic neuropathy [^114vuxM6]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

Painful neuropathy is a common and often progressive complication of diabetes. Patients frequently report symptoms of tingling, burning, lancinating pain, hyperesthesia and allodynia. The natural history of the disease may vary from intermittent mild symptoms to severe chronic daily pain; the latter is often associated with diminished quality of life. There are a variety of pharmaceutical agents from different medicinal categories available for the symptomatic treatment of painful diabetic neuropathy, however selecting an agent is often challenging given the breadth of choices and lack of consistent guidelines. As a result, many patients remain untreated or undertreated. This article presents a practical clinical approach to the treatment of pain in diabetic neuropathy. Recommendations for first, second and third line medications are based on specific evidence for the treatment of painful diabetic neuropathy as well as safety, tolerability, drug interactions and cost. Additional topics of discussion include breakthrough pain, opioid use and topical therapies. This review does not comprehensively discuss all possible treatments for painful neuropathy, but provides a systematic approach designed to guide clinicians in tailoring therapies to the individual patient.

### Update on treating painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy: a review of current US guidelines with a focus on the most recently approved management options [^113XCGtW]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Several other international and national clinical practice guidelines on the management of neuropathy are available, including those from the Neuropathic Pain Special Interest Group of the International Association for the Study of Pain, the European Federation of Neurological Societies, the European Association for the Study of Diabetes, the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, the Canadian Pain Society, the German Society for Neurology, and the German National Disease Management Guideline for Diabetic Neuropathy. However, in light of their publication date (before 2016), and/or focus on the management of neuropathic pain in general, any guidance specific to painful DPN may be incomplete, especially as it relates to newer treatment options.

Key AAN, ADA, and AACE recommendations for managing painful DPN are summarized in Table 1. All three organizations advocate a customized stepwise approach, with the choice of pharmacological agent guided by factors such as comorbidities, cost, and potential for DDIs and ADRs.

Table 1
Summary of Current American Academy of Neurology, American Diabetes Association, and American Association of Clinical EndocrinologyGuidelines for the Management of Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy

Guideline-recommended (although not necessarily FDA-approved) first-line oral options to treat painful DPN include tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), gabapentinoids, and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs); the AAN guideline also includes sodium channel blockers. Based on the results of a meta-analysis of Class I and II trials showing comparable estimated effect sizes, the AAN states that it is difficult to recommend any one drug class over another. Later-line therapy involves switching first-line agents or using combinations of pharmacological agents from different classes or pharmacological plus non-pharmacological options.

Capsaicin 8% topical system, the only FDA approved non-oral pharmaceutical to treat painful DPN, is a first-line treatment option in the AACE guidelinesand is recommended in the ADA compendium. The German Diabetes Association (Deutsche Diabetes Gesellschaft, DDG) also positions capsaicin 8% topical system as a first-line treatment for painful DPN, whereas an international expert consensus group considers it a third line analgesic treatment for painful DPN in clinical practice.

Abstract

Painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is a highly prevalent and disabling complication of diabetes that is often misdiagnosed and undertreated. The management of painful DPN involves treating its underlying cause via lifestyle modifications and intensive glucose control, targeting its pathogenesis, and providing symptomatic pain relief, thereby improving patient function and health-related quality of life. Four pharmacologic options are currently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat painful DPN. These include three oral medications (duloxetine, pregabalin, and tapentadol extended release) and one topical agent (capsaicin 8% topical system). More recently, the FDA approved several spinal cord stimulation (SCS) devices to treat refractory painful DPN. Although not FDA-approved specifically to treat painful DPN, tricyclic antidepressants, serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, gabapentinoids, and sodium channel blockers are common first-line oral options in clinical practice. Other strategies may be used as part of individualized comprehensive pain management plans. This article provides an overview of the most recent US guidelines for managing painful DPN, with a focus on the two most recently approved treatment options (SCS and capsaicin 8% topical system), as well as evidence for using FDA-approved and guideline-supported drugs and devices. Also discussed are unmet needs for this patient population, and evidence for potential future treatments for painful DPN, including drugs with novel mechanisms of action, electrical stimulation devices, and nutraceuticals.

### From guideline to patient: a review of recent recommendations for pharmacotherapy of painful diabetic neuropathy [^115Lbnan]. Journal of Diabetes and Its Complications (2014). Low credibility.

Painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is a common complication of diabetes mellitus, affecting, by some estimates, up to one quarter of diabetic patients. Since 2010, no fewer than 5 major international treatment guidelines for painful DPN have been issued, and there are meaningful differences among them. Duloxetine, pregabalin, gabapentin, and tricyclic antidepressants are the mainstays of treatment, but the choice of which class or agent to use in any given patient should be informed by patient characteristics. This review seeks to describe the differences among the recently issued guidelines, to assess the evidence on which they are based, and to offer insight into the most appropriate treatment choices based on patient characteristics.

Pain Management

Overall, it is estimated that more than half of patients with T2D develop signs and symptoms of peripheral neuropathy during their lifetime, with rates of 20–30% in newly diagnosed and early-stage (first few years) disease. Neuropathic pain is a cardinal symptom of DPN and is often severe, poorly diagnosed and difficult to treat. From the patient's perspective, painful DPN has a marked negative impact on daily functioning (sleeping, walking, driving, exercising, working, and performing other daily activities) and HR-QoL which, in turn, increases the social and economic burden of the disease.

Successful treatment of painful DPN requires a personalized approach balancing pain relief with improvements in daily functioning and HR-QoL. To achieve this, it is likely that more sophisticated tools beyond simple pain scores (eg, VAS or NPRS) will provide better feedback about neuropathic symptoms. The Neuropathy Total Symptom Score-6 evaluates the frequency and intensity of individual neuropathy sensory symptoms frequently identified by DPN patients (ie, numbness and/or insensitivity, prickling and/or tingling sensation, burning sensation, aching pain and/or tightness, sharp, shooting, lancinating pain, and allodynia and/or hyperalgesia). The modified Toronto Clinical Neuropathy Score evaluates the presence of symptoms (ie, foot pain, numbness, tingling, weakness, ataxia and upper limb symptoms) and clinical signs (ie sensory pinprick, temperature, light touch, vibration, and position sense) associated with DPN.

At present, there is a significant need for more effective and better-tolerated treatment options for painful DPN, as many affected patients continue to experience pain despite treatment. While initial responses to current guideline-recommended oral treatments (eg, antiepileptics and antidepressants) may be good, pharmacological tolerance often occurs and higher dosages may be needed to achieve the same level of pain relief. This increases the likelihood of ADRs. Such patients may benefit from treatment choices that are better tolerated, such as lower-dose combination therapy (pharmacological and non-pharmacological), topical agents (eg, capsaicin 8% topical systems), nutraceuticals, and non-pharmacological approaches (eg, nerve stimulation).

### Current strategies for the management of painful diabetic neuropathy [^116fDynV]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2022). Medium credibility.

The development of painful diabetic neuropathy (PDN) is a common complication of chronic diabetes that can be associated with significant disability and healthcare costs. Prompt symptom identification and aggressive glycemic control is essential in controlling the development of neuropathic complications; however, adequate pain relief remains challenging and there are considerable unmet needs in this patient population. Although guidelines have been established regarding the pharmacological management of PDN, pain control is inadequate or refractory in a high proportion of patients. Pharmacotherapy with anticonvulsants (pregabalin, gabapentin) and antidepressants (duloxetine) are common first-line agents. The use of oral opioids is associated with considerable morbidity and mortality and can also lead to opioid-induced hyperalgesia. Their use is therefore discouraged. There is an emerging role for neuromodulation treatment modalities including intrathecal drug delivery, spinal cord stimulation, and dorsal root ganglion stimulation. Furthermore, consideration of holistic alternative therapies such as yoga and acupuncture may augment a multidisciplinary treatment approach. This aim of this review is to focus on the current management strategies for the treatment of PDN, with a discussion of treatment rationale and practical considerations for their implementation.

### Painful diabetic neuropathy: the need for new approaches [^111oG7p4]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2024). Medium credibility.

Painful diabetic neuropathy is a common vexing problem for people with diabetes and a costly problem for society. The pathophysiology is not well understood, and no safe and effective mechanistically-based treatment has been identified. Poor glycemic control is a risk factor for painful diabetic neuropathy. Excessive intraneuronal glucose in people with diabetes can be shunted away from physiological glycolysis into multiple pathological pathways associated with neuropathy and pain. The first three treatments that are traditionally offered consist of risk factor reduction, lifestyle modifications, and pharmacological therapy, which includes only three drugs that are approved for this indication by the United States Food and Drug Administration. All of these traditional treatments are often inadequate for relieving neuropathic pain, and thus, new approaches are needed. Modern devices based on neuromodulation technology, which act directly on the nervous system, have been recently cleared by the United States Food and Drug Administration for painful diabetic neuropathy and offer promise as next-in-line therapy when traditional therapies fail.

### A systematic guideline by the ASPN workgroup on the evidence, education, and treatment algorithm for painful diabetic neuropathy: SWEET [^114DGjpY]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The ASPN SWEET Guideline provides the first comprehensive clinical tool encompassing both pharmacological, interventional, and alternative approaches to PDN. As PDN continues to be a difficult and under-treated condition, the SWEET Guideline is intended to improve appropriate and safe treatment of patients suffering from PDN. Many recent interventional and pharmacological agents have significantly improved the ability to improve pain and suffering in PDN. Further research continues to be developed, which should only help in further identifying the optimal treatment of patients with PDN. In addition to global open access to this guideline for all clinicians involved in the care of those suffering from PDN, ASPN aims to disseminate the awareness of these important guidelines via social media, webinars, annual conferences, and other media forms. The ASPN SWEET guideline is intended to be a living document and will be updated at appropriate intervals as the research and science around PDN continues to evolve. The ASPN guidelines will be shared on the society's website at aspnpain.com. The guidelines will be updated at a minimum of every 12 months and as impactful evidence is published relevant to the content of the SWEET guideline.

Introduction

Painful diabetic neuropathy (PDN) is a leading cause of pain and disability globally with a lack of consensus on the appropriate treatment of those suffering from this condition. Recent advancements in both pharmacotherapy and interventional approaches have broadened the treatment options for PDN. There exists a need for a comprehensive guideline for the safe and effective treatment of patients suffering from PDN.

Objective

The SWEET Guideline was developed to provide clinicians with the most comprehensive guideline for the safe and appropriate treatment of patients suffering from PDN.

Methods

The American Society of Pain and Neuroscience (ASPN) identified an educational need for a comprehensive clinical guideline to provide evidence-based recommendations for PDN. A multidisciplinary group of international experts developed the SWEET guideline. The world literature in English was searched using Medline, EMBASE, Cochrane CENTRAL, BioMed Central, Web of Science, Google Scholar, PubMed, Current Contents Connect, Meeting Abstracts, and Scopus to identify and compile the evidence for diabetic neuropathy pain treatments (per section as listed in the manuscript) for the treatment of pain. Manuscripts from 2000-present were included in the search process.

Results

After a comprehensive review and analysis of the available evidence, the ASPN SWEET guideline was able to rate the literature and provide therapy grades for most available treatments for PDN utilizing the United States Preventive Services Task Force criteria.

Conclusion

The ASPN SWEET Guideline represents the most comprehensive review of the available treatments for PDN and their appropriate and safe utilization.

FDA-Approved Treatments for Painful DPN

Five treatments are currently approved by the FDA to treat painful DPN based on their efficacy and safety in RCTs in this patient population. These include three oral medications (duloxetine, pregabalin, and tapentadol extended release [ER]); one topical agent (capsaicin 8% topical system); and low- and high-frequency spinal cord stimulation (SCS) devices indicated for the treatment of chronic intractable painful DPN, which is defined as constant moderate to severe pain that has no known cure and requires daily medical treatment.

Table 2 summarizes the year of approval, indication, contraindications, and most common adverse events reported with the use of FDA-approved options to treat DPN. Although pain-related endpoints among RCTs differed to some extent, all treatments were associated with significant improvements from baseline in pain scores relative to placebo or standard therapy, as well as increases in the proportion of patients achieving a clinically meaningful pain response (ie, a ≥ 30% or ≥ 50% improvement in pain score).

### Treatment of symptomatic diabetic neuropathy [^111NQYNf]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Painful diabetic neuropathy is a common and particularly unpleasant long-term complication of diabetes that affects a significant minority of patients with distal polyneuropathy. After exclusion of other causes of neuropathic pain, attention should be focused on achieving optimal and stable glycaemic control avoiding flux of blood glucose levels, which have been shown to aggravate pain. Most patients will require pain control therapy and whilst the tricyclic drugs remain a first-line approach, their use is often hampered by predictable but troublesome side effects. Gabapentin, the only agent specifically licensed for the treatment of neuropathic pain in the United Kingdom, is useful in diabetic neuropathy and is generally better tolerated than the tricyclics. Additionally, other pharmacological and non-pharmacological pain management approaches may be useful. Patient education has a significant role to play in the avoidance of late neurological complications.

### Update on treating painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy: a review of current US guidelines with a focus on the most recently approved management options [^116okBMY]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

In patients with painful DPN refractory to conventional treatment, neuromodulation with low- or high-frequency SCS is an FDA-approved option. Intrathecal drug delivery may also improve pain management. Although its FDA approval is not specific to painful DPN, intrathecal drug delivery using either ziconotide or morphine is recommended and is FDA-approved for chronic neuropathic pain. Use of these neuromodulating options requires careful consideration of individual patient characteristics (eg, pain location and intensity, stage of progression of DPN, response to previous pain therapies, comorbid medical conditions, and concomitant drug treatment), as well as their advantages and disadvantages from a patient-centric perspective.

Future clinical studies in patients with painful DPN are needed to address gaps in current knowledge and provide guidance as to which patients will best respond to various interventions. A better understanding of the pathological mechanistic changes that occur in patients with painful DPN would not only lead to newer therapeutic targets but also would facilitate the discovery of biomarkers to identify responders versus non-responders. To support the use of one agent over another, comparative studies are needed to evaluate the efficacy of two or more active interventions (including oral medications, topical treatments, non-traditional therapies, non-pharmacologic interventions, and combination therapy). The long-term effectiveness of interventions on pain, as well as on other outcomes (eg, HR-QoL, patient functioning, mood, sleep) should be investigated.

### The pathogenesis and management of painful diabetic neuropathy: a review [^116N1Ppv]. Diabetic Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Painful diabetic neuropathy has always been a challenging complication of diabetes mellitus. Emerging theories suggest that early dysaesthesia associated with painful neuropathy may act as a marker for the development of the 'at risk' foot, allowing preventative clinical strategies to be undertaken. The mechanisms of neuropathic pain are complex. The authors' intentions are to help members of the diabetes care team better understand and appreciate the diverse symptoms reported by patients. The various treatments available for painful neuropathy are discussed in detail. Robust comparative studies on such treatments are, however, unavailable and the authors have designed a logical approach to management based on best current evidence and their own clinical experience.

### Diagnosing and managing diabetic somatic and autonomic neuropathy [^111sekfr]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

The diagnosis and management of diabetic neuropathy can be a major challenge. Late diagnosis contributes to significant morbidity in the form of painful diabetic neuropathy, foot ulceration, amputation, and increased mortality. Both hyperglycaemia and cardiovascular risk factors are implicated in the development of somatic and autonomic neuropathy and an improvement in these risk factors can reduce their rate of development and progression. There are currently no US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved disease-modifying treatments for either somatic or autonomic neuropathy, as a consequence of multiple failed phase III clinical trials. While this may be partly attributed to premature translation, there are major shortcomings in trial design and outcome measures. There are a limited number of partially effective FDA-approved treatments for the symptomatic relief of painful diabetic neuropathy and autonomic neuropathy.

### Novel therapeutical approaches based on neurobiological and genetic strategies for diabetic polyneuropathy – A review [^112yh3Yw]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Neuropathy is among the most often reported consequences of diabetes and the biggest cause of morbidity and mortality in people suffering from this life-long disease. Although different therapeutic methods are available for diabetic neuropathy, it is still the leading cause of limb amputations, and it significantly decreases patients' quality of life.

Aim

This study investigates potential novel therapeutic options that could ameliorate symptoms of DN.

Methodology

Research and review papers from the last 10 years were taken into consideration.

Results

There are various traditional drugs and non-pharmacological methods used to treat this health condition. However, the research in the area of pathogenic-oriented drugs in the treatment of DN showed no recent breakthroughs, mostly due to the limited evidence about their effectiveness and safety obtained through clinical trials. Consequently, there is an urgent demand for the development of novel therapeutic options for diabetic neuropathy.

Conclusion

Some of the latest novel diagnostic methods for diagnosing diabetic neuropathy are discussed as well as the new therapeutic approaches, such as the fusion of neuronal cells with stem cells, targeting gene delivery and novel drugs.

### Diabetic neuropathy: clinical manifestations and current treatments [^1111ugsB]. The Lancet: Neurology (2012). Medium credibility.

Diabetic peripheral neuropathy is a prevalent, disabling disorder. The most common manifestation is distal symmetrical polyneuropathy (DSP), but many patterns of nerve injury can occur. Currently, the only effective treatments are glucose control and pain management. While glucose control substantially decreases the development of neuropathy in those with type 1 diabetes, the effect is probably much smaller in those with type 2 diabetes. Evidence supports the use of specific anticonvulsants and antidepressants for pain management in patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy. However, the lack of disease-modifying therapies for diabetic DSP makes the identification of new modifiable risk factors essential. Growing evidence supports an association between components of the metabolic syndrome, including prediabetes, and neuropathy. Studies are needed to further explore this association, which has implications for the development of new treatments for this common disorder.

### What is new in neuropathic pain? [^113j5PUG]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2007). Low credibility.

Introduction

Neuropathic pain occurs in 1% of the population and is difficult to manage. Responses to single drugs are limited in benefit. Thirty percent will fail to respond altogether. This is a review of newer drugs and treatment paradigms.

Methods

A literature review was performed pertinent to new drugs and treatment algorithms in the management of neuropathic pain.

Results

New information on opioids (tramadol and buprenorphine) suggests benefits in the management of neuropathic pain and has increased interest in their use earlier in the course of illness. Newer antidepressants, selective noradrenaline, and serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) have evidence for benefit and reduced toxicity without an economic disadvantage compared to tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs). Pregabalin and gabapentin are effective in diabetic neuropathy and postherpetic neuralgia. Treatment paradigms are shifting from sequential single drug trials to multiple drug therapies. Evidence is needed to justify this change in treatment approach.

Conclusion

Drug choices are now based not only on efficacy but also toxicity and drug interactions. For this reason, SNRIs and gabapentin/pregabalin have become popular though efficacy is not better than TCAs. Multiple drug therapies becoming an emergent treatment paradigm research in multiple drug therapy are needed.

### Update on treating painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy: a review of current US guidelines with a focus on the most recently approved management options [^117KW4ne]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Epalrestat (an aldose reductase inhibitor which targets activation of the polyol pathway to reduce glucose metabolism) and actovegin (a poly adenosine diphosphate-ribose polymerase inhibitor with pleiotropic neuroprotective and metabolic effects) are licensed to treat DPN in various countries outside of the US based on limited evidence of their efficacy in modifying neurological signs and symptoms.

Two nutraceuticals, α-lipoic acid and benfotiamine, are also licensed to treat DPN in various countries outside of the USand, according to the ADA, may be used as a pathogenetic adjunct to established pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions for the management of persistent neuropathic symptoms. Of the nutraceuticals that have been evaluated in phase 3 RCTs (Table 7),α-lipoic acid and benfotiamine have the best evidence of neuropathic benefits. α-Lipoic acid, a naturally occurring fatty acid, provides neuroprotective effects by acting as an antioxidant. Benfotiamine, a fat-soluble derivative of thiamine, acts by inhibiting the formation of advanced glycation end products, thereby improving neuropathic symptoms in patients with DPN. These nutraceuticals are well tolerated, with adverse event profiles similar to those with placebo.

Table 7
Mechanism of Action and Efficacy of Nutraceuticals in Treating Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy in Phase 3 Randomized Controlled Trials

Supplementation with vitamin B, vitamin D, and magnesium should currently be limited to patients with proven deficiencies to help prevent the worsening of DPN and other diabetes-related disorders. Additional evidence is needed before the use of other nutraceuticals (eg, vitamin E, acetyl-L-carnitine, polyunsaturated fatty acids) can be recommended to modify the pathogenesis of DPN.

### Diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain: recognition and management [^117KC1yN]. Pain Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

The occurrence of diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is linked to poor glycemic control over time. While most people never develop diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain (DPNP) as a consequence of DPN, enough of them do that we must have effective options for the management of this disabling condition. Two years ago there were no formally approved medications for the treatment of DPNP, and now there are two medications with Food and Drug Administration approval for DPNP. One of these medications, duloxetine has been established to significantly improve pain and to address depression by its reuptake inhibition of norepinephrine and serotonin. This article examines the epidemiology of DPNP, its underlying pathogenesis, necessary evaluation methods, and treatment options available with a focus on the role of duloxetine.

### Painful and non-painful diabetic neuropathy, diagnostic challenges and implications for future management [^114J7i6Z]. Brain (2021). Medium credibility.

Peripheral neuropathy is one of the most common complications of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Up to half of patients with diabetes develop neuropathy during the course of their disease, which is accompanied by neuropathic pain in 30–40% of cases. Peripheral nerve injury in diabetes can manifest as progressive distal symmetric polyneuropathy, autonomic neuropathy, radiculo-plexopathies, and mononeuropathies. The most common diabetic neuropathy is distal symmetric polyneuropathy, which we will refer to as DN, with its characteristic glove and stocking like presentation of distal sensory or motor function loss. DN or its painful counterpart, painful DN, are associated with increased mortality and morbidity; thus, early recognition and preventive measures are essential. Nevertheless, it is not easy to diagnose DN or painful DN, particularly in patients with early and mild neuropathy, and there is currently no single established diagnostic gold standard. The most common diagnostic approach in research is a hierarchical system, which combines symptoms, signs, and a series of confirmatory tests. The general lack of long-term prospective studies has limited the evaluation of the sensitivity and specificity of new morphometric and neurophysiological techniques. Thus, the best paradigm for screening DN and painful DN both in research and in clinical practice remains uncertain. Herein, we review the diagnostic challenges from both clinical and research perspectives and their implications for managing patients with DN. There is no established DN treatment, apart from improved glycaemic control, which is more effective in type 1 than in type 2 diabetes, and only symptomatic management is available for painful DN. Currently, less than one-third of patients with painful DN derive sufficient pain relief with existing pharmacotherapies. A more precise and distinct sensory profile from patients with DN and painful DN may help identify responsive patients to one treatment versus another. Detailed sensory profiles will lead to tailored treatment for patient subgroups with painful DN by matching to novel or established DN pathomechanisms and also for improved clinical trials stratification. Large randomized clinical trials are needed to identify the interventions, i.e. pharmacological, physical, cognitive, educational, etc., which lead to the best therapeutic outcomes.

### Painful diabetic neuropathy [^114aetr1]. BMJ (2014). Excellent credibility.

Diabetes is a worldwide epidemic, and associated neuropathy is its most costly and disabling complication. Given the rising prevalence of painful diabetic neuropathy, it is increasingly important that we understand the best ways to diagnose and treat this condition. Diagnostic tests in this field are evolving rapidly. These include the use of skin biopsies to measure small unmyelinated fibers, as well as even newer techniques that can measure both small unmyelinated fibers and large myelinated fibers in the same biopsy. The main treatments for painful diabetic neuropathy remain management of the underlying diabetes and drugs for the relief of pain. However, emerging evidence points to major differences between type 1 and type 2 diabetes, including the ability of glycemic control to prevent neuropathy. Enhanced glucose control is much more effective at preventing neuropathy in patients with type 1 diabetes than in those with type 2 disease. This dichotomy emphasizes the need to study the pathophysiologic differences between the two types of diabetes, because different treatments may be needed for each condition. The impact of the metabolic syndrome on neuropathy in patients with type 2 diabetes may account for the difference between the two types of diabetes and requires further study. Finally, neuropathic pain is under-recognized and undertreated despite an ever evolving list of effective drugs. Evidence exists to support several drugs, but the optimal sequence and combination of these drugs are still to be determined.

### Painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy: consensus recommendations on diagnosis, assessment and management [^1118p4c7]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is common, is associated with significant reduction in quality of life and poses major treatment challenges to the practising physician. Although poor glucose control and cardiovascular risk factors have been proven to contribute to the aetiology of DPN, risk factors specific for painful DPN remain unknown. A number of instruments have been tested to assess the character, intensity and impact of painful DPN on quality of life, activities of daily living and mood. Management of the patient with DPN must be tailored to individual requirements, taking into consideration the co-morbidities and other factors. Pharmacological agents with proven efficacy for painful DPN include tricyclic anti-depressants, the selective serotonin and noradrenaline re-uptake inhibitors, anti-convulsants, opiates, membrane stabilizers, the anti-oxidant alpha-lipoic acid and topical agents including capsaicin. Current first-line therapies for painful DPN include tricyclic anti-depressants, the serotonin and noradrenaline re-uptake inhibitor duloxetine and the anti-convulsants pregabalin and gabapentin. When prescribing any of these agents, other co-morbidities and costs must be taken into account. Second-line approaches include the use of opiates such as synthetic opioid tramadol, morphine and oxycodone-controlled release. There is a limited literature with regard to combination treatment. In extreme cases of painful DPN unresponsive to pharmacotherapy, occasional use of electrical spinal cord stimulation might be indicated. There are a number of unmet needs in the therapeutic management of painful DPN. These include the need for randomized controlled trials with active comparators and data on the long-term efficacy of agents used, as most trials have lasted for less than 6 months. Finally, there is a need for appropriately designed studies to investigate non-pharmacological approaches.

### Medical management of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes: a consensus algorithm for the initiation and adjustment of therapy: a consensus statement of the American diabetes association and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes [^111SjetJ]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Type 2 diabetes is epidemic. Its long-term consequences translate into enormous human suffering and economic costs; however, much of the morbidity associated with long-term microvascular and neuropathic complications can be substantially reduced by interventions that achieve glucose levels close to the nondiabetic range. Although new classes of medications and numerous combinations have been demonstrated to lower glycemia, current-day management has failed to achieve and maintain the glycemic levels most likely to provide optimal healthcare status for people with diabetes.

### Effects of treatments for symptoms of painful diabetic neuropathy: systematic review [^111FBs79]. BMJ (2007). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the effects of treatments for the symptoms of painful diabetic neuropathy.

Design

Systematic review.

Data Sources

Articles (English and full text) on double blind randomised trials found by searching with the key words anticonvulsant, antidepressant, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, tramadol, opioid, ion channel blocker, diabetic neuropathy, diabetic peripheral neuropathy, peripheral neuropathy, and neuropathy. The search included Medline, Embase, EMB reviews-AP Journal club, and the Cochrane central register of controlled trials.

Study Selection

Randomised controlled trials comparing topically applied and orally administered drugs with a placebo in adults with painful diabetic neuropathy.

Data Extraction

Data were extracted to examine quality of methods, characteristics of studies and patients, efficacy, and side effects. The primary outcome was dichotomous information for 50% or moderate reduction of pain. Secondary outcomes were 30% reduction of pain and withdrawals related to adverse events.

Results

Odds ratios were calculated for achievement of 30%, 50%, or moderate pain relief and for withdrawals related to adverse effects. Twenty five reports were included and seven were excluded. The 25 included reports compared anticonvulsants (n = 1270), antidepressants (94), opioids (329), ion channel blockers (173), N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist (14), duloxetine (805), capsaicin (277), and isosorbide dinitrate spray (22) with placebo. The odds ratios in terms of 50% pain relief were 5.33 (95% confidence interval 1.77 to 16.02) for traditional anticonvulsants, 3.25 (2.27 to 4.66) for newer generation anticonvulsants, and 22.24 (5.83 to 84.75) for tricylic antidepressants. The odds ratios in terms of withdrawals related to adverse events were 1.51 (0.33 to 6.96) for traditional anticonvulsants, 2.98 (1.75 to 5.07) for newer generation anticonvulsants, and 2.32 (0.59 to 9.69) for tricylic antidepressants. Insufficient dichotomous data were available to calculate the odds ratios for ion channel blockers.

Conclusion

Anticonvulsants and antidepressants are still the most commonly used options to manage diabetic neuropathy. Oral tricyclic antidepressants and traditional anticonvulsants are better for short term pain relief than newer generation anticonvulsants. Evidence of the long term effects of oral antidepressants and anticonvulsants is still lacking. Further studies are needed on opioids, N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonists, and ion channel blockers.

### Polyneuropathy quality measurement set: quality improvement in neurology [^112up3V1]. Neurology (2022). High credibility.

American Academy of Neurology Institute (AANI) painful diabetic neuropathy (PDN) — prevalence context, effective medication classes, and opioid guidance are outlined as follows: Peripheral neuropathy affects ∼5% of the population and diabetes is the most common cause, and given the effect of PDN on patients' quality of life, appropriate treatment is essential. To increase effective management, the American Academy of Neurology Institute published and recently updated a PDN treatment guideline and the American Academy of Neurology provides quality measures to implement. Based on a meta-analysis, the guideline identified gabapentinoids, serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, and sodium channel blockers as having the highest efficacy for PDN, and noted that topical, nontraditional, and nonpharmacologic interventions are available. Based on the considerable potential harms of opioids, the practice guideline update suggested against starting opioids and recommends offering the option of a safe taper of opioids for those already taking them.

Other Guideline-Supported First-Line Oral Options

Guideline-supported first-line oral options for the treatment of painful DPN in clinical practice include TCAs, gabapentinoids, SNRIs, and sodium channel blockers, which are considered to modulate pain. Table 3 summarizes the MoA and clinical efficacy of these drug classes in treating painful DPN.,

Table 3
Mechanism of Action and Efficacy of Oral Pharmacological Agents Recommended as First-Line treatmentin Patients with Painful Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy

Tricyclic Antidepressants

TCAs (eg, amitriptyline (Elavil ®, Vanatrip ®), nortriptyline (Aventyl ®, Pamelor ®), desipramine (Norpramin ®), and imipramine (Tofranil ®)are frequently used to treat painful DPN and other types of neuropathic pain. Most evidence for the efficacy of TCAs in treating painful DPN relates to the use of amitriptyline, with little evidence for other TCAs (Table 3).

The well-known ADRs of TCAs (eg, gastrointestinal issues, orthostatic hypotension, dry mouth, and urinary retention) are likely due to their activity on histaminic, adrenergic, and cholinergic receptors, and may be problematic in patients with pre-existing constipation, urinary retention, or orthostatic hypotension. Nortriptyline and desipramine, are generally better tolerated than amitriptyline and imipramine and may be a safer option, especially in older patients.

Management of Conflict of Interest

All authors were required to disclose conflicts of interest prior to assignment of topics. The senior authors determined the extent of the conflict of interest ensuring balanced inquiry and evaluation for each manuscript section. One of the co-primary authors without conflict was identified for each section and is the adjudication determination official for any issues of potential conflict. All authors were asked to recuse themselves on any recommendation potentially affected by a disclosed conflict. Additionally, authors without conflict vetted all recommendations for bias.

Methodology: Literature Search, Evidence Ranking

The world literature in English was searched using Medline, EMBASE, Cochrane CENTRAL, BioMed Central, Web of Science, Google Scholar, PubMed, Current Contents Connect, Meeting Abstracts, and Scopus to identify and compile the evidence for diabetic neuropathy pain treatments (per section as listed in the manuscript) for the treatment of pain. Manuscripts from 2000-present were included in the search process. Search words were selected based upon the section represented. Identified peer-reviewed literature was critiqued using the USPSTF criteria for quality of evidence, with modifications for neuromodulation studies (Table 1). After USPSTF letter grading was assigned, the working subgroup then assigned the "level of certainty regarding benefit" as described in Table 2.

Table 1
Quality of Evidence Ranking Using United States Preventative Services Task Force Criteria Modified for Therapy

Table 2
Levels of Certainty Regarding Net Benefit

For each major section or topic, ASPN formulated consensus points. Consensus points should not be confused with recommendations based on consensus alone (Evidence Level II), which were rendered as clinical guidance in the situations where, due to the lack of evidence-based literature (such as randomized controlled trials [RCTs]), prospective observational studies, and retrospective cohort/case series), the best available guidance is expert opinion.

### Towards prevention of diabetic peripheral neuropathy: clinical presentation, pathogenesis, and new treatments [^115NQxeo]. The Lancet: Neurology (2022). High credibility.

Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) occurs in up to half of individuals with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. DPN results from the distal-to-proximal loss of peripheral nerve function, leading to physical disability and sometimes pain, with the consequent lowering of quality of life. Early diagnosis improves clinical outcomes, but many patients still develop neuropathy. Hyperglycaemia is a risk factor and glycaemic control prevents DPN development in type 1 diabetes. However, glycaemic control has modest or no benefit in individuals with type 2 diabetes, probably because they usually have comorbidities. Among them, the metabolic syndrome is a major risk factor for DPN. The pathophysiology of DPN is complex, but mechanisms converge on a unifying theme of bioenergetic failure in the peripheral nerves due to their unique anatomy. Current clinical management focuses on controlling diabetes, the metabolic syndrome, and pain, but remains suboptimal for most patients. Thus, research is ongoing to improve early diagnosis and prognosis, to identify molecular mechanisms that could lead to therapeutic targets, and to investigate lifestyle interventions to improve clinical outcomes.

### Screening for diabetic peripheral neuropathy in resource-limited settings [^114sa8mt]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2023). Medium credibility.

Principle 3: individualized treatment and scheduled follow-up

Management of diabetic peripheral neuropathy remains a challenge for health care providers because none of the currently available treatments effectively target underlying pathogenesis. Furthermore, diabetic peripheral neuropathy is a progressive disorder that can cause irreversible nerve damage. Thus, individualized treatment and scheduled follow-up are interdependent. The main objectives of treatment are intensive glycemic control and management of neuropathic pain alongside one or all of the following: diabetes self-management education and support; lifestyle optimization; adequate foot care and proper or therapeutic footwear; and multifactorial control of cardiovascular risk factors.

PDN is particularly difficult to manage and current treatment options include pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic interventions. Four classes of oral pharmacologic interventions are recommended for treatment: gabapentinoids (gabapentin, mirogabalin, and pregabalin); serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (desvenlafaxine, duloxetine, and venlafaxine); tricyclic antidepressants (amitriptyline, imipramine, and nortriptyline); and sodium channel blockers (carbamazepine, lacosamide, lamotrigine, oxcarbazepine, and valproic acid). Topical treatment with capsaicin may be considered in patients with contraindications to oral pharmacotherapy or a preference for topical pain management. Due to their adverse events profile and high abuse potential, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors/opioid dual mechanism agents (tapentadol and tramadol) are currently not recommended for treating PDN. Unfortunately, pharmacologic intervention seldom achieves complete resolution of neuropathic pain due to limited efficacy, dose-limiting adverse events, or both. Therefore, a standardized approach to combining pharmacotherapies is an unmet medical need and remains an area of intense study.

Spinal cord stimulation is an emerging therapeutic adjunct for the management of PDN. This type of non-pharmacologic intervention — referred to as neuromodulation — effectively relieves pain, improves neurological function, and enhances quality of life. High-quality evidence supports the use of either invasive or non-invasive neuromodulation for the treatment of patients with PDN that is refractory to pharmacologic intervention.

Finally, health care providers should remember that patients with asymmetrical distribution of clinical signs and symptoms or an unclear diagnosis require prompt referral to a neurologist for confirmatory electrophysiological testing.

Painful diabetic neuropathy (PDN) pharmacologic therapy — Level B: In patients with PDN, clinicians should offer TCAs, SNRIs, gabapentinoids, and/or sodium channel blockers to reduce pain (Level B). Supporting rationale notes that four classes of oral medications have demonstrated evidence of pain reduction in meta-analyses (TCAs, SNRIs, gabapentinoids, and sodium channel blockers), and that the best estimates of the effect sizes and the corresponding CIs are comparable for all of these drug classes, which makes recommendations for one over another difficult.

### Diabetic neuropathy [^114Yregc]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2019). High credibility.

The global epidemic of prediabetes and diabetes has led to a corresponding epidemic of complications of these disorders. The most prevalent complication is neuropathy, of which distal symmetric polyneuropathy (for the purpose of this Primer, referred to as diabetic neuropathy) is very common. Diabetic neuropathy is a loss of sensory function beginning distally in the lower extremities that is also characterized by pain and substantial morbidity. Over time, at least 50% of individuals with diabetes develop diabetic neuropathy. Glucose control effectively halts the progression of diabetic neuropathy in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, but the effects are more modest in those with type 2 diabetes mellitus. These findings have led to new efforts to understand the aetiology of diabetic neuropathy, along with new 2017 recommendations on approaches to prevent and treat this disorder that are specific for each type of diabetes. In parallel, new guidelines for the treatment of painful diabetic neuropathy using distinct classes of drugs, with an emphasis on avoiding opioid use, have been issued. Although our understanding of the complexities of diabetic neuropathy has substantially evolved over the past decade, the distinct mechanisms underlying neuropathy in type 1 and type 2 diabetes remains unknown. Future discoveries on disease pathogenesis will be crucial to successfully address all aspects of diabetic neuropathy, from prevention to treatment.

### How and why SGLT2 inhibitors should be explored as potential treatment option in diabetic retinopathy: clinical concept and methodology [^113uT2fU]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Patients suffering from type 2 diabetes are at an increased risk of developing classical microvascular complications such as retinopathy, neuropathy, and nephropathy, which represent a significant health burden. Tight control of blood glucose, blood pressure, and serum cholesterol reduce the risk of microvascular complications but effective pharmacologically targeted treatment options for the treatment and prevention of diabetic microangiopathy are still lacking. Pharmacological inhibition of sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) might have the potential to directly protect against microvascular complications and could represent a potential treatment option. Randomized controlled clinical proof of concept trials are needed to investigate a potential central role of SGLT2 inhibitors in the prevention of diabetic microangiopathy and its classical clinical complications of retinopathy, neuropathy, and nephropathy.

### Evidence for the use of gabapentin in the treatment of diabetic peripheral neuropathy [^116aQJUP]. Clinical Therapeutics (2001). Low credibility.

Background

One of the most common peripheral nerve complications of diabetes is painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN). Although tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) have traditionally been used to relieve the pain of this condition, gabapentin's reported efficacy in various neuropathic pain states and its favorable side-effect profile compared with other available agents have led to interest in the use of this agent for the treatment of DPN.

Objectives

This paper reviews the current clinical literature on the effectiveness and tolerability of gabapentin in the treatment of DPN. It also considers whether the evidence favors gabapentin's use as an alternative or first-line agent.

Methods

A search of the English- and French-language literature for the years 1990 through 2000 was performed using MEDLINE, Current Contents/Clinical Medicine, and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, plus the reference lists of the articles identified through this search. The search terms used were gabapentin, anticonvulsant, diabetic peripheral neuropathy, and neuropathy. Included studies were limited to trials in human subjects.

Results

The literature search identified several case reports and case series, as well as 3 small placebo-controlled studies (2 complete, 1 brief report) and 1 comparative trial against the TCA amitriptyline. The designs and dosing regimens differed between studies.

Conclusions

Many clinicians consider gabapentin an alternative treatment option in patients with DPN who are unable to tolerate traditional agents or in whom traditional agents are contraindicated. To date, gabapentin has been well tolerated, superior to placebo, and equivalent to amitriptyline in small clinical trials of short duration. Although overall efficacy and safety profiles appear to be favorable, larger long-term studies are needed to determine the place of gabapentin in relation to other treatment options. There is currently insufficient evidence from controlled trials to support the use of gabapentin as first-line therapy for DPN.

### Diabetic peripheral neuropathy: prevention and treatment [^114pHkgo]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Diabetic peripheral neuropathy occurs in up to 50% of patients with diabetes mellitus and increases the risk of diabetic foot ulcers and infections. Consistent screening and clear communication are essential to decrease disparities in assessment of neuropathic symptoms and diagnosis. Physicians should address underlying risk factors such as poor glycemic control, vitamin B12 deficiency, elevated blood pressure, and obesity to reduce the likelihood of developing neuropathy. First-line drug therapy for painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy includes duloxetine, gabapentin, amitriptyline, and pregabalin; however, these medications do not restore sensation to affected extremities. Evidence for long-term benefit and safety of first-line treatment options is lacking. Second-line drug therapy includes nortriptyline, imipramine, venlafaxine, carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, topical lidocaine, and topical capsaicin. Periodic, objective monitoring of medication response is critical because patients may not obtain desired pain reduction, adverse effects are common, and serious adverse effects can occur. Opioids should generally be avoided. Nondrug therapies with low- to moderate-quality evidence include exercise and neuromodulation with spinal cord stimulation or transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation. Peripheral transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation is well tolerated and inexpensive, but benefits are modest. Other treatments, such as acupuncture, alpha-lipoic acid, acetyl-L-carnitine, cannabidiol, and onabotulinumtoxinA need further study in patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy.

VG: Which medications are used in the treatment of painful diabetic neuropathy?

UA: So the typical medications which tend to be used and which are categorised as really being either first- or second-line are anticonvulsants and antidepressants. Within the anticonvulsant class, we have pregabalin and gabapentin and within the antidepressant class, we have duloxetine and the tricyclic antidepressant i.e. amitriptyline, although other tricyclic antidepressants have also been used.

VG: What are the differences in the international treatment guidelines for painful diabetic neuropathy?

UA: The international guidelines tend to agree that pregabalin, gabapentin and duloxetine and also tricyclics are either first- or second-line in the treatment regime. After this, there is some real divergence in what the recommendations are. But if we think about those four medications [classes], these are the ones that tend to be used as either first- or second-line. Now, one difference in the American Association of Neurology 2011 guidelines recommended that pregabalin as first-line. Now, this is largely due to a technical aspect of the duloxetine studies in which some of them have a greater than 20% dropout and thus the level of evidence was not considered quite as strong. The newer American Academy of Neurology guidelines are due and we'll see what their recommendations are.

VG: What are the differences in efficacy between gabapentin and tricyclic antidepressants?

UA: A study has looked at the differences between these two drugs but there's really no significant differences [in efficacy] found. A meta-analysis of head-to-head trials comparing the results of gabapentin with two tricyclics did not show any difference and we know that pregabalin is similar efficacy to gabapentin in the most part, so there's no real difference so far that has been identified. However, there is a study which is underway which is called OPTION-DM this is still underway and this is looking at combination therapy and treatment pathways with pregabalin, duloxetine and amitriptyline and certainly, this will shed more light on this question.

VG: And which medications in the drug class anticonvulsants are used in the treatment of diabetic retinopathy?

### A consideration of the psychological aspects to managing patients with painful diabetic neuropathy: an insight into pain management services at a tertiary centre in the UK [^111LJt4C]. Diabetes Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Results

Current Management of pDN

pDN is a debilitating feature of diabetic neuropathy which results in poor quality of life, functional impairment and morbidity. Current international guidelines advocate the use of pharmacotherapy targeting the pathomechanisms of pain generation in pDN. Moderate improvements in pain are considered to be approximately 30–50% pain relief, whereas a good outcome is considered greater than 50% pain relief. Patients should be routinely counselled about the effectiveness of neuropathic pain agents in that only about one in three people will achieve 'good outcomes'. As a result a significant proportion of individuals have significant inadequately control pain and as a result, poor functioning. There is very little focus in international guidelines on delivery of functional improvements through psychological interventions.

For a further review of diabetic neuropathy and treatment of pDN we recommend a review of Iqbal et al. and Alam et al.

### An integrated perspective on diabetic, alcoholic, and drug-induced neuropathy, etiology, and treatment in the US [^113aEdtS]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Neuropathic pain (NeuP) is a syndrome that results from damaged nerves and/or aberrant regeneration. Common etiologies of neuropathy include chronic illnesses and medication use. Chronic disorders, such as diabetes and alcoholism, can cause neuronal injury and consequently NeuP. Certain medications with antineoplastic effects also carry an exquisitely high risk for neuropathy. These culprits are a few of many that are fueling the NeuP epidemic, which currently affects 7%–10% of the population. It has been estimated that approximately 10% and 7% of US adults carry a diagnosis of diabetes and alcohol disorder, respectively. Despite its pervasiveness, many physicians are unfamiliar with adequate treatment of NeuP, partly due to the few reviews that are available that have integrated basic science and clinical practice. In light of the recent Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines that advise against the routine use of μ-opioid receptor-selective opioids for chronic pain management, such a review is timely. Here, we provide a succinct overview of the etiology and treatment options of diabetic and alcohol- and drug-induced neuropathy, three different and prevalent neuropathies fusing the combined clinical and preclinical pharmacological expertise in NeuP of the authors. We discuss the anatomy of pain and pain transmission, with special attention to key ion channels, receptors, and neurotransmitters. An understanding of pain neurophysiology will lead to a better understanding of the rationale for the effectiveness of current treatment options, and may lead to better diagnostic tools to help distinguish types of neuropathy. We close with a discussion of ongoing research efforts to develop additional treatments for NeuP.

### Update on treating painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy: a review of current US guidelines with a focus on the most recently approved management options [^1129yJmM]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Disease Modification

In the US, no pharmacological treatment is currently approved to modify the progression of DPN.

The loss of ENF density over time in patients with DPN is a natural consequence of disease progression and a major contributor to diabetic foot ulcers. Preliminary evidence suggests that the capsaicin 8% topical system may modify peripheral neuropathic pain, as it has been shown to regenerate and restore sensory nerve fibers. In a RCT assessing the mechanism of pain relief of the capsaicin 8% topical system, skin biopsies at 3 months in patients with painful DPN showed a significant increase in the density of intra-ENFs and sub-ENFs in those treated with the capsaicin 8% topical system plus SOC (n = 25) but not in those receiving SOC alone (n = 12). Patients with painful DPN who had pain reduction at 3 months with the capsaicin 8% topical system plus SoC (n = 18) had correlating increases in nerve fiber density, whereas non-responders without pain reduction (n = 7) did not. Importantly, the increase in ENF density did not correlate with an increase in pain, suggesting that nerve fibers were restored in a healthier state compared with baseline. Although the increases in vasodilation and improvements in warm perception sensory testing observed with the capsaicin 8% topical system require further investigation, they may signal restoration of sensory function which, in turn, can lead to improvement in the overall health of the diabetic foot. In similar exploratory studies, patients with peripheral neuropathic pain (n = 23), painful chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN; n = 16), or non-freezing cold injury (n = 16), were treated with a single application of the capsaicin 8% topical system. Heat-evoked neurogenic vasodilatation showed improvement in half of the patients with peripheral neuropathic pain 4 weeks after application, indicating that nerve fibers had regenerated. Intra- and sub-ENF regeneration and restoration were also shown when skin biopsies were performed 3 months post-application in patients with painful CIPNor non-freezing cold injury. These studies suggest that the benefits of high-concentration capsaicin may extend beyond pain relief for patients with painful DPN, although more research is needed to better understand the impact of capsaicin on the diabetic foot.

### Comprehensive insights into diabetic peripheral neuropathy: pathophysiology and therapeutic approaches [^111ucrYZ]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Diabetic peripheral neuropathy is a common and debilitating complication of diabetes, resulting from prolonged hyperglycemia-induced peripheral nerve dysfunction. It leads to neuropathic pain, sensory impairment, and diminished quality of life.

Methods

This review summarizes the current literature available on the pathophysiology and treatment approaches for DPN. The literature search was performed in PubMed, ScienceDirect, Scopus, and Web of Science for articles published between 2009 and 2025. The search used keywords such as "Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy", "pathophysiology", "pharmacological treatments", and "non-pharmacological treatments". Relevant data were collected from peer-reviewed journals, clinical trials, and authoritative databases. Only studies published in English were included. Studies limited to animal models or addressing other complications of diabetes were excluded.

Results

The pathogenesis of diabetic peripheral neuropathy is driven by metabolic and inflammatory changes that contribute to nerve damage and neuropathic pain. The United States Food and Drug Administration has approved pharmacological treatments for painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy: pregabalin, duloxetine, gabapentin, extended-release tapentadol, tramadol, and the capsaicin 8% patch. Non-Food and Drug Administration-approved therapies, such as amitriptyline and the 5% lidocaine patch, are also widely used. Non-pharmacological interventions, including tonic spinal cord stimulation, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, manual acupuncture, local plantar vibration, and the Frequency Rhythmic Electrical Modulated System, show promise in alleviating symptoms and promoting nerve regeneration.

Conclusion

A multifaceted approach incorporating pharmacological and non-pharmacological therapies is essential for optimizing patient outcomes in diabetic peripheral neuropathy. Targeting underlying pathophysiological mechanisms while providing symptomatic relief can enhance treatment efficacy and improve the quality of life for individuals with diabetic peripheral neuropathy.

Diabetic neuropathy (DN) is one of the most common and disabling complications of diabetes mellitus worldwide, and its painful form, painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy (PDPN), further degrades patient outcomes. It is estimated that by 2025, there will be 589 million adults, approximately one-ninth of the worldwide population, living with diabetes, showing an increase to 850 million by 2050. DN contributes substantially to the global healthcare burden, with annual diabetes-related costs exceeding USD 760 billion. Among those affected, PDPN develops in approximately 25–50% of patients, leading to neuropathic pain, impaired sensation, and functional weakness, and is strongly associated with diminished quality of life due to persistent symptoms. Prevalence rates of DN and PDPN vary considerably across regions, ranging from 16% to 60%, depending on diagnostic criteria and population characteristics.

Economically, the diabetes neuropathy (DN) spending is estimated to be greater than USD 45.9 billion annually in the United States by 2025, whereby about USD 31 billion will be spent on DN-specific care. In contrast, the rest will be spent on the control of complications, including foot ulcers and amputations. DN is linked to an over 46% higher use of healthcare resources in ambulatory, hospital and pharmacy environments, and comparable effects on costs and productivity are documented in Europe and emerging economies. Although these are some serious clinical and societal consequences, the existing treatment approaches to diabetic neuropathy (DN) and its painful variant (PDPN) are mainly symptomatic. Common pharmacological treatments that include antidepressants, anticonvulsants and opioids can bring an important reduction in pain in less than 50% of patients, and does not alter the disease, nor does it lack side effects. Currently, no treatment has been established to stimulate nerve growth or reverse the underlying neuropathology, hence the urgent need to take steps in terms of mechanism-based therapies.

### Advances in the epidemiology, pathogenesis and management of diabetic peripheral neuropathy [^112XcmJ8]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) affects up to 50% of patients with diabetes and is a major cause of morbidity and increased mortality. Its clinical manifestations include painful neuropathic symptoms and insensitivity, which increases the risk for burns, injuries and foot ulceration. Several recent studies have implicated poor glycaemic control, duration of diabetes, hyperlipidaemia (particularly hypertryglyceridaemia), elevated albumin excretion rates and obesity as risk factors for the development of DPN. Although there is now strong evidence for the importance of nerve microvascular disease in the pathogenesis of DPN, the risk factors for painful DPN are not known. However, emerging evidence regarding the central correlates of painful DPN is now afforded by brain imaging. The diagnosis of DPN begins with a careful history of sensory and motor symptoms. The quality and severity of neuropathic pain if present should be assessed using a suitable scale. Clinical examination should include inspection of the feet and evaluation of reflexes and sensory responses to vibration, light touch, pinprick and the 10-g monofilament. Glycaemic control and addressing cardiovascular risk is now considered important in the overall management of the neuropathic patient. Pharmacological treatment of painful DPN includes tricyclic compounds, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (e.g. duloxetine), anticonvulsants (e.g. pregabalin), opiates, membrane stabilizers, the antioxidant alpha lipoic acid and others. Over the past 7 years, new agents with perhaps less side effect profiles have immerged. Management of patients with painful neuropathy must be tailored to individual requirements and will depend on the presence of other co-morbidities. There is limited literature with regard to combination treatment.

### Pathogenesis, diagnosis and clinical management of diabetic sensorimotor peripheral neuropathy [^114X6HWA]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2021). High credibility.

Diabetic sensorimotor peripheral neuropathy (DSPN) is a serious complication of diabetes mellitus and is associated with increased mortality, lower-limb amputations and distressing painful neuropathic symptoms (painful DSPN). Our understanding of the pathophysiology of the disease has largely been derived from animal models, which have identified key potential mechanisms. However, effective therapies in preclinical models have not translated into clinical trials and we have no universally accepted disease-modifying treatments. Moreover, the condition is generally diagnosed late when irreversible nerve damage has already taken place. Innovative point-of-care devices have great potential to enable the early diagnosis of DSPN when the condition might be more amenable to treatment. The management of painful DSPN remains less than optimal; however, studies suggest that a mechanism-based approach might offer an enhanced benefit in certain pain phenotypes. The management of patients with DSPN involves the control of individualized cardiometabolic targets, a multidisciplinary approach aimed at the prevention and management of foot complications, and the timely diagnosis and management of neuropathic pain. Here, we discuss the latest advances in the mechanisms of DSPN and painful DSPN, originating both from the periphery and the central nervous system, as well as the emerging diagnostics and treatments.

Introduction and Methodology

Development Process

The American Society of Pain and Neuroscience (ASPN), through its mission to increase evidence-based access to treatment, has commissioned a systematic guideline process to outline the current state of the art in treatment of painful diabetic neuropathy (PDN) (SWEET guidelines). Members of the SWEET consensus group were selected from among the thought leaders across a broad spectrum of specialties interested in the treatment of diabetic neuropathy within both ASPN and other societies. A diverse authorship included experts from the specialties of Pain Medicine, Neurology, Podiatry, Primary Care, Neurosurgery, Physiatry, Psychology, and Anesthesiology. The current guideline will examine the evidence, education and current treatment options. The SWEET consensus work group was convened and at regular intervals, members have evaluated the level of current evidence in the peer-reviewed literature for topics that have been identified as critical for treatment.

Work groups were convened to conduct literature searches and examine the evidence for the topics developed by lead authors in outline form. After the literature search was completed, each author was asked to provide cited references, and evidence rank. The section leaders then formulated the recommendation grade, based on the evidence, which were reviewed by at least three different, nonconflicted SWEET working group members. If conflicts of interest were identified, recusal was required as outlined below. ASPN utilizes the United States Preventative Services Task Force (USPSTF) format with slight modification for interventional pain treatment. This process has been established in previous ASPN publications. Once literature was reviewed, consensus statements were created and graded based upon the ASPN-USPSTF criteria listed in Table 1. The process by which section leaders then created consensus points included in-person meetings, teleconference, or other electronic or audio-video communications to define the consensus; agreement by at least 80% of the contributing authors was considered a quorum. Consensus strength was defined, as described in previous ASPN guidelines. If a recommendation was proposed with < 50% consensus, based on assigned evidence rank and recommendation grade, then no consensus was achieved.

This consensus guideline gives guidance to clinicians concerning painful PDN treatment and evidence-based practice and outcome optimization. However, these recommendations should not be construed as a standard of care, but instead represent best practices. This guidance is based on several factors and peer-reviewed evidence, and regardless of the strength of evidence, requires interpretation for clinical application.

### Oral and topical treatment of painful diabetic polyneuropathy: practice guideline update summary: report of the AAN guideline subcommittee [^112dCQTK]. Neurology (2022). High credibility.

Recommendation 7 and Statements 7a–7d — trialing, switching, and combining medications: A series of medications may need to be tried to identify the treatment that most benefits a given patient with PDN, and a treatment to reduce neuropathic pain should be considered ineffective when titrated to a demonstrated effective dose and duration without significant pain reduction; the typical duration in which efficacy is demonstrated is approximately 12 weeks, with a range from 4 to 16 weeks. An intervention should be considered intolerable when medication causes adverse effects that outweigh any benefit, and overall failure is defined as either ineffective after 12 weeks or intolerable; choosing a different mechanism or class is expected to increase the likelihood of achieving new pain relief, and if only partial efficacy is achieved, adding a second medication of a different class may provide combined efficacy greater than that provided by each medication individually. Clinicians should counsel patients that a series of medications may need to be tried (Level B), should determine failure as approximately 12 weeks without clinically significant pain reduction or when side effects outweigh benefit (Level B), should offer a trial of a medication from a different effective class when there is no meaningful improvement or significant adverse effects with the initial therapeutic class (Level B), and should offer a trial of a medication from a different class for patients with partial improvement with an initial therapeutic class (Level B).

Painful diabetic neuropathy (PDN) assessment and counseling — Level B recommendations state that clinicians should assess patients with diabetes for peripheral neuropathic pain and its effect on these patients' function and quality of life (Level B), and when initiating pharmacologic intervention for PDN, clinicians should counsel patients that the goal of therapy is to reduce, and not necessarily to eliminate, pain (Level B). Clinicians should assess patients with PDN for the presence of concurrent mood and sleep disorders and treat them as appropriate (Level B), noting that patients with diabetes are more likely to have mood and sleep disorders than the general population; mood and sleep can both influence pain perception, and treating concurrent mood and sleep disorders may help reduce pain and improve quality of life. To set expectations, the guideline notes that approximately 30% pain reduction is considered a success in clinical trials.

### Oral and topical treatment of painful diabetic polyneuropathy: practice guideline update summary: report of the AAN guideline subcommittee [^113wtJ85]. Neurology (2022). High credibility.

Painful diabetic polyneuropathy (PDN) — research needs are highlighted, noting key gaps that should be addressed in future studies, including that few studies have investigated the effect of interventions on quality of life, patient functioning, mood, or sleep and few comparative effectiveness studies have been performed; studies with an active comparator have rarely included more than one other intervention, limiting data to support one intervention over another. Another limitation to the current evidence is the lack of data beyond 16 weeks for any intervention, and future studies should focus on the long-term effects (positive and negative) of opioids in this population to determine whether there is any role for these medications in this population.

Combination therapy with agents from different classes has not been studied extensively in well-designed trials. One study evaluated the efficacy of combined duloxetine (60 mg/day) and pregabalin (300 mg/day) to high-dose duloxetine (120 mg/day) and pregabalin (600 mg/day). The combination therapy was no more effective than individual agent therapy. Given the paucity of data on combination therapy, a clinician should carefully weigh the pros and cons before initiating such therapy.
