## Question

what is best medication to treat elevated diastolic blood pressure

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which medication is best to treat elevated diastolic blood pressure, i.e., isolated diastolic hypertension, and how to choose among options. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how isolated diastolic hypertension is defined and how strong the evidence is that it confers risk. Then, I should verify what major guidelines say about treatment thresholds and whether any class is preferred for IDH. Next, I will examine the limited direct evidence on drug effects in IDH and consider mechanistic plausibility. After that, I need to integrate general hypertension evidence and safety considerations, including the risk of excessive diastolic lowering. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stepwise recommendation and state the bottom line clearly, while noting uncertainties and research gaps.

> Let me first confirm the definition and epidemiology so I don't anchor on a misleading premise. Isolated diastolic hypertension is commonly defined as diastolic blood pressure ≥ 80 mm Hg with systolic blood pressure < 130 mm Hg by ACC/AHA 2017, or ≥ 90 mm Hg with systolic < 140 mm Hg by ESC/ESH 2018, and it accounts for a minority of hypertension cases, with prevalence estimates around 6.5% by ACC/AHA criteria in U.S. adults and lower by ESC/ESH thresholds, and it is more frequent in younger adults and men, which matters for risk interpretation and treatment decisions [^112QMvsV] [^11765MTX] [^11723uZN].

> Wait, let me verify the risk signal before jumping to treatment. Large cohort analyses show mixed associations of IDH with cardiovascular outcomes, with some studies showing no significant increase in incident ASCVD, heart failure, or CKD under ACC/AHA definitions, whereas others suggest higher risk in younger adults or specific populations, and a prospective cohort of newly diagnosed hypertensives found ISH carried higher event rates than IDH or SDH, underscoring heterogeneity and the need to individualize decisions rather than treat IDH as uniformly high risk [^112QMvsV] [^1158GoL4] [^112nQ9cC].

> I need to check what guidelines actually recommend for IDH, because if there is no class-specific guidance, I should avoid over-specifying. The 2023 ESH guideline explicitly recommends following the general treatment strategy for blood pressure lowering in patients with isolated diastolic hypertension, with no preference stated for a specific drug class, and it emphasizes periodic evaluation and lifestyle interventions for all patients with IDH, which aligns with a risk-stratified, mechanism-informed approach rather than a one-size-fits-all drug choice [^114PU99X] [^111zC6Wn].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about "best" when direct comparative evidence is sparse. I should double-check whether any randomized data specifically tested therapy in IDH. The PROGRESS trial subgroup analysis included patients with IDH and suggested a roughly 28% relative risk reduction in major vascular events with perindopril-based therapy, but the estimate was imprecise and the analysis was underpowered, so while promising, it cannot establish superiority of a specific class for IDH, and contemporary guidelines do not elevate perindopril above others for this phenotype [^112Rk6si] [^114PU99X].

> Let me consider mechanistic plausibility to guide reasonable first-line choices. IDH in younger adults often reflects increased peripheral vascular resistance, so agents that reduce afterload and peripheral resistance, such as ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, are mechanistically attractive, whereas thiazide diuretics and beta-blockers may be less targeted to the primary hemodynamic abnormality in many younger IDH patients, though they remain effective antihypertensives overall [^115NwPHR] [^117PrqjH].

> Next, I should review the broader hypertension evidence base to ensure I'm not overlooking class effects that could matter clinically. Meta-analyses and regulatory summaries consistently show that lowering blood pressure itself drives reductions in stroke, myocardial infarction, and mortality across classes, with low-dose thiazides, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and calcium channel blockers all demonstrating benefit, and no class clearly outperforming others for hard outcomes when blood pressure reduction is comparable, which supports choosing based on comorbidity, tolerability, and phenotype rather than a hypothetical "best" class for IDH [^113Bc5Dp] [^115FQHjS] [^111UepAZ] [^114febe9].

> I should confirm safety nuances specific to diastolic pressure, because excessive diastolic lowering could be harmful in some contexts. Observational analyses from SPRINT and other cohorts suggest that in patients whose systolic blood pressure is already controlled, diastolic pressures below about 60 mm Hg are associated with higher major adverse cardiovascular event risk, whereas a diastolic range of 70–80 mm Hg appears optimal, reinforcing the principle to treat diastolic hypertension but avoid overcorrection that drives diastolic pressure too low, especially in older or higher-risk patients [^112o8TaD] [^11521VcP].

> But wait, what if the patient is young and low risk; do we need medication at all. I need to ensure I apply thresholds correctly. For adults without cardiovascular disease and with estimated 10-year ASCVD risk less than 7.5%, the 2025 ACC/AHA guidance supports a 3–6 month trial of lifestyle therapy before initiating medication for stage 1 hypertension, including IDH, whereas those at higher risk or with diabetes or CKD have a lower threshold to start pharmacotherapy, which helps avoid overtreatment while not missing those who benefit [^115L1yYm].

> Let me synthesize a practical, stepwise approach and sanity-check each step. Start with comprehensive lifestyle therapy including sodium restriction, weight optimization, alcohol moderation, and regular aerobic and resistance exercise, reassessing blood pressure after 3–6 months in low-risk patients, then initiate pharmacotherapy if diastolic remains ≥ 80 mm Hg in higher-risk adults or ≥ 90 mm Hg in lower-risk adults after the lifestyle trial, selecting a first-line agent from among an ACE inhibitor, ARB, or dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker based on age, comorbidities, race or ethnicity, and tolerability, with thiazide diuretics or beta-blockers reserved for compelling indications or as add-on therapy if needed, and titrate to achieve a diastolic target generally in the 70–80 mm Hg range while avoiding diastolic pressures below 60 mm Hg whenever possible [^111zC6Wn] [^notfound] [^115L1yYm] [^11521VcP].

> I should double-check the bottom line so I don't overstate anything. There is no single "best" medication for isolated diastolic hypertension based on current guideline-directed evidence; treatment should follow general hypertension principles, prioritize lifestyle therapy in appropriate candidates, and select among first-line classes according to comorbidity profile and patient factors, with a reasonable preference in younger IDH patients for agents that reduce peripheral resistance, while vigilantly avoiding excessive diastolic lowering that may increase harm, and recognizing that ongoing research may refine phenotype-specific strategies in the future [^114PU99X] [^117SDP5Q] [^112nQ9cC].

There is **no single best medication** for elevated diastolic blood pressure (DBP); treatment should be individualized based on age, comorbidities, and risk profile [^112nQ9cC]. First-line options include **ACE inhibitors, ARBs, calcium channel blockers, and thiazide diuretics** [^115CjvEw], with beta-blockers reserved for specific indications (e.g. coronary artery disease, heart failure, arrhythmias) [^115xwpan]. Combination therapy is often required to achieve DBP targets, and lifestyle modifications are essential [^111UepAZ]. The key is to lower DBP to < 80–90 mm Hg [^11725iAD] while avoiding excessive diastolic lowering (< 60 mm Hg) [^11521VcP], which may increase cardiovascular risk [^112o8TaD].

---

## Pharmacological treatment options

Several classes of **antihypertensive medications** effectively lower DBP:

| **Medication class** | **Examples** | **Mechanism of action** | **Clinical considerations** |
|-|-|-|-|
| ACE inhibitors | - Lisinopril <br/> - Enalapril | Block conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, reducing vasoconstriction and aldosterone secretion | - Effective in younger patients <br/> - Beneficial in diabetes and chronic kidney disease [^115CjvEw] |
| ARBs | - Losartan <br/> - Valsartan | Block angiotensin II receptors, reducing vasoconstriction and aldosterone secretion | - Effective in younger patients <br/> - Beneficial in diabetes and chronic kidney disease [^115CjvEw] |
| Calcium channel blockers | - Amlodipine <br/> - Diltiazem | Inhibit calcium influx in vascular smooth muscle, causing vasodilation | - Effective in older patients <br/> - Useful in isolated systolic hypertension [^112tDTGf] |
| Thiazide diuretics | - Hydrochlorothiazide <br/> - Chlorthalidone | Promote sodium and water excretion, reducing plasma volume and vascular resistance | - Effective in older patients <br/> - Useful in isolated systolic hypertension [^115sVpty] |
| Beta-blockers | - Metoprolol <br/> - Carvedilol | Reduce heart rate and cardiac output, and inhibit renin release | Reserved for patients with coronary artery disease, heart failure, or arrhythmias [^115xwpan] |

---

## Evidence supporting medication effectiveness

- **ACE inhibitors and ARBs**: Particularly effective in younger patients and those with diabetes or chronic kidney disease, as they target the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), which plays a significant role in diastolic hypertension [^112Rk6si].

- **Calcium channel blockers and thiazide diuretics**: Effective in older patients, particularly those with isolated systolic hypertension, but also beneficial in reducing diastolic blood pressure [^115sVpty].

- **Beta-blockers**: Generally not first-line therapy for isolated diastolic hypertension unless there are specific indications such as coronary artery disease, heart failure, or arrhythmias [^115xwpan].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines emphasize **individualized treatment** based on patient characteristics, comorbidities, and cardiovascular risk:

- **First-line therapy**: ACE inhibitors, ARBs, calcium channel blockers, and thiazide diuretics are recommended as initial therapy for elevated diastolic blood pressure [^115CjvEw].

- **Combination therapy**: Often required to achieve target blood pressure levels, particularly in patients with higher cardiovascular risk or resistant hypertension [^117DKjSW].

- **Lifestyle modifications**: Essential adjuncts to pharmacological therapy, including dietary sodium restriction, weight loss, regular physical activity, and alcohol moderation [^117DKjSW].

---

## Potential risks and side effects

Each medication class carries potential risks and side effects that must be considered when selecting therapy:

- **ACE inhibitors**: Cough, hyperkalemia, angioedema.

- **ARBs**: Hyperkalemia, renal impairment.

- **Calcium channel blockers**: Peripheral edema, hypotension, bradycardia.

- **Thiazide diuretics**: Hypokalemia, hyponatremia, hyperuricemia.

- **Beta-blockers**: Bradycardia, fatigue, sexual dysfunction.

---

## Special considerations

Certain populations require **special consideration** when selecting antihypertensive therapy:

- **Elderly patients**: Calcium channel blockers and thiazide diuretics are often preferred due to their effectiveness in isolated systolic hypertension and favorable side effect profiles [^1171C6Tb].

- **Patients with diabetes or chronic kidney disease**: ACE inhibitors or ARBs are preferred due to their renal protective effects [^115CjvEw].

- **Pregnant patients**: Methyldopa, labetalol, and nifedipine are preferred antihypertensive agents [^111MjVgK].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

There is **no single best medication** for elevated diastolic blood pressure; treatment should be individualized based on patient characteristics, comorbidities, and cardiovascular risk. ACE inhibitors, ARBs, calcium channel blockers, and thiazide diuretics are all effective first-line options, with beta-blockers reserved for specific indications. Combination therapy and lifestyle modifications are often necessary to achieve target blood pressure levels.

### Cardiovascular risk in patients with treated isolated diastolic hypertension and isolated low diastolic blood pressure [^115E4bpW]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Hypertension affects around 30% of adults globallyand is associated with an increased cardiovascular risk.SPRINT (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial) revealed that intensive treatment targeting systolic blood pressure (SBP) < 120 mm Hg was superior to standard treatment targeting SBP < 140 mm Hg in reducing cardiovascular events by 25% and all‐cause death by 27%. Consequently, the 2017 American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) guideline revised the blood pressure (BP) treatment target to < 130/80 mm Hg.

For the patients on antihypertensive treatment, while the association between high SBP and cardiovascular risk is well established, the potential harms posed by elevated diastolic BP (DBP) is still debated, especially when SBP achieves the target. This condition is known as treated isolated diastolic hypertension (IDH). Most studies examining the ACC/AHA definition of IDH have not found its correlation with cardiovascular disease, except in Asian populations and young adults. The focus of these studies was primarily on treatment‐naive individuals, leaving this correlation for antihypertensive drug–treated patients uncertain. Additionally, concerns also exist regarding the potential negative impact of excessive reduction of DBP, which could offset the cardiovascular benefits of reducing SBP.

The 2018 European Society of Cardiology/European Society of Hypertension guideline recommended a DBP target range of 70 to 80 mm Hg for all risk levels, while the ACC/AHA guideline did not specify a lower limit of DBP for antihypertensive drug–treated patients. However, these recommendations were primarily based on expert opinion rather than empirical evidence. It remains unknown whether high or extremely low DBP is associated with increased cardiovascular risk in antihypertensive drug–treated patients with normalized SBP.

To answer this question, we conducted a secondary analysis of SPRINT to determine if treated IDH and treated isolated low DBP (ILDBP) were associated with major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) in patients with on‐treatment SBP < 130 mm Hg.

### Prevalence, awareness, and treatment of isolated diastolic hypertension: insights from the China PEACE million persons project [^112ocZm6]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Second, to the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to assess the awareness of having hypertension among a large Chinese population with IDH compared with other hypertension subtypes, and to identify characteristics that are associated with awareness. Our findings suggest that even though awareness among participants with IDH increases with age, it is significantly lower as compared with awareness among participants with other hypertension subtypes, across all age groups. These findings are consistent with previous reports from other countries which have shown 26% lower diagnosis (hazard ratio 0.74; CI 0.60–0.92) and 31% lower medication initiation (hazard ratio 0.69; CI 0.55–0.86) among younger patients with IDH as compared with systolic/diastolic hypertension. 18

Third, our assessment of the antihypertensive medications among treated participants with IDH provides information on what medications may not be effectively treating IDH or that people are not taking. We found that the majority of these patients were treated with only 1 class of antihypertensive medication. Calcium channel blockers was the most frequently used class of antihypertensive medication among these patients, even though they may not be most effective for this phenotype, which could be due to the prescription habits of the physicians, availability, and cost‐related factors of other classes of antihypertensive medications. 28

Introduction

Isolated diastolic hypertension (IDH), whether in treated or untreated patients, is an uncommon type of hypertension accounting for < 20% of hypertension cases. 1, 2, 3, 4 Nevertheless, IDH is independently associated with an increased risk of stroke, heart disease, and the other sequelae of hypertension. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 However, the most recent US, Chinese, and European high blood pressure guidelines do not specifically address IDH as a distinct phenotype or provide any specific guidance for its management. 15, 16, 17

Although many studies have focused on patient characteristics, knowledge, and treatment, patients with IDH constitute a small subset of all patients with hypertension, and have traditionally been included within the total population of hypertensive patients, 1, 18, 19, 20 even though they may have unique features. 20, 21 Given its low prevalence, a large sample size would be required to fully capture the range of attributes of individuals with IDH across diverse population subgroups, and draw robust conclusions with high precision. Characterizing these patients specifically and assessing their awareness and treatment patterns can generate new knowledge about this distinct subtype of hypertension. This information will not only expand our knowledge about the IDH phenotype, but could also equip us to identify targets for improvement of care.

Accordingly, we sought to identify and study patients with IDH, whether treated or untreated, using data from the China PEACE (Patient‐centered Evaluative Assessment of Cardiac Events) Million Persons Project, a large‐scale population‐based screening project which was initiated with the aim of providing detailed information on smaller subgroups of patients who have traditionally been hard to identify in the population. We sought to describe the characteristics and prevalence of individuals with IDH across diverse population subgroups among both untreated and treated hypertensives; assess awareness of having hypertension among untreated IDH participants; assess the number and classes of medications used by treated participants with IDH; and identify the associations between individual characteristics with prevalence of, and awareness among those with IDH. Although some of the treated patients may be individuals who initially had systolic and diastolic hypertension, but with medications have only diastolic hypertension, this does represent the spectrum of patients who would be seen in practice with IDH, either as a de novo condition or as inadequately treated diastolic hypertension. Moreover, the treatment rates in China are sufficiently low that the population with IDH largely represents those with the de novo condition.

### Isolated diastolic hypertension and risk of cardiovascular disease: controversies in hypertension-pro side of the argument [^112nQ9cC]. Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

Isolated diastolic hypertension (IDH), defined as diastolic blood pressure in the hypertensive range but systolic blood pressure not in the hypertensive range, is not uncommon (< 20%) among adults with hypertension. IDH often manifests in concurrence with other cardiovascular risk factors. Individuals with IDH tend to have lower awareness of their hypertension compared with those with both systolic and diastolic hypertension. IDH appears to be a largely underrated risk factor for cardiovascular disease events, which may be explained by inconsistent association of IDH with cardiovascular disease events. The inconsistency suggests that IDH is heterogeneous. One size does not seem to fit all in the clinical management of individuals with IDH. Rather than treating IDH as a monolithic low-risk condition, detailed phenotyping in the context of individual comprehensive cardiovascular risk would seem to be most useful to assess an individual's expected net benefit from therapy. In this review, we highlight that the clinical relevance of IDH differs by individual clinical characteristics, and elucidate groups of individuals with IDH that should be wary of cardiovascular disease risks.

### Effects of blood pressure lowering on major vascular events among patients with isolated diastolic hypertension: the perindopril protection against recurrent stroke study (PROGRESS) trial [^112Rk6si]. Stroke (2011). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Despite clear evidence that blood pressure (BP) lowering is effective for prevention of cardiovascular events among patients with isolated systolic hypertension and systolic-diastolic hypertension, there is ongoing uncertainty about its effects in those with isolated diastolic hypertension. The objective of the present analysis is to determine whether BP lowering provides benefits to patients with isolated diastolic hypertension.

Methods

Patients with cerebrovascular disease and hypertension at baseline (n = 4283) were randomly assigned to either active treatment (perindopril in all participants plus indapamide for those with neither an indication for nor a contraindication to a diuretic) or matching placebo(s). The primary outcome was total major vascular events.

Results

There were 1923 patients with isolated systolic hypertension (systolic BP ≥ 140 mm Hg and diastolic BP < 90 mm Hg), 315 with isolated diastolic hypertension (systolic BP < 140 mm Hg and diastolic BP ≥ 90 mm Hg), and 2045 with systolic-diastolic hypertension (systolic BP ≥ 140 mm Hg and diastolic BP ≥ 90 mm Hg) at baseline. Active treatment reduced the relative risk of major vascular events by 27% (95% CI, 10% to 41%) among patients with isolated systolic hypertension, by 28% (-29% to 60%) among those with isolated diastolic hypertension, and by 32% (17% to 45%) among those with systolic-diastolic hypertension. There was no evidence of differences in the magnitude of the effects of treatment among different types of hypertension (P homogeneity = 0.89).

Conclusions

BP lowering is likely to provide a similar level of protection against major vascular events for patients with isolated diastolic hypertension as for those with isolated systolic hypertension and systolic-diastolic hypertension. Clinical Trial Registration Information- This trial was not registered because patients were enrolled before July 1, 2005.

### Systolic blood pressure: it's time to take control [^115NwPHR]. American Journal of Hypertension (2004). Low credibility.

Once considered an inconsequential part of the aging process, an age-associated rise in systolic blood pressure (SBP) occurs as a consequence of increased arterial stiffness and contributes to a high prevalence of systolic hypertension after middle-age. Elevated SBP imparts a predilection toward the onset of vascular events, highlighting the importance of its control. Current philosophy ranks systolic pressure as the most relevant component of blood pressure (BP) for determining risk for cardiovascular and other events in hypertensive patients, particularly those > 50 years of age. Despite its prognostic role, SBP remains more difficult to control than diastolic BP (DBP), and most middle-age and older hypertensive patients fail to achieve recommended targets. In part, the lack of strict control of SBP in the more aged population lies in the physiology of hypertension. Younger persons tend toward isolated diastolic hypertension or combined systolic-diastolic hypertension, primarily driven by increased peripheral resistance and more effectively treated by antihypertensive medications; whereas older persons develop isolated systolic hypertension (ISH) associated with increased arterial stiffness that appears to be less amenable to current therapies. Thus, diastolic pressure in hypertensive patients often plateaus as patients reach middle-age and subsequently declines, whereas systolic pressure consistently rises through the ensuing decades. Treatment approaches favoring control of DBP frequently result in residual high SBP, putting patients at greater risk for vascular complications. Improving patient outcomes relies on antihypertensive therapy that appropriately addresses control of SBP and pulse pressure, underscoring the importance of therapeutic options that effectively reduce arterial stiffness.

### Systolic blood pressure is the main etiology for poorly controlled hypertension [^1132UmK5]. American Journal of Hypertension (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Isolated systolic hypertension is an important risk factor for cardiovascular events. The purpose of this study was to detect the prevalence of and to evaluate the effectiveness of currently available medications in the treatment of uncontrolled isolated systolic hypertension.

Methods

We randomly selected a total of 585 patients with hypertension from our database. The two most recent blood pressure (BP) readings and other data were obtained by chart review.

Results

Of 585 patients, 340 (58%) had controlled BP. Of 245 patients with uncontrolled hypertension, 77.1% had uncontrolled isolated systolic hypertension and the remaining 22.9% had uncontrolled diastolic hypertension. Patients with uncontrolled systolic hypertension were on average taking more antihypertensive medications than patients with controlled BP (2.10 ± 0.09; p = 0.034).

Conclusions

Systolic hypertension is the etiology of uncontrolled hypertension in the majority of patients. Currently available antihypertensive medications are less effective in controlling systolic hypertension.

### Prevalence, awareness, and treatment of isolated diastolic hypertension: insights from the China PEACE million persons project [^115oTah7]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Characterizing and assessing the prevalence, awareness, and treatment patterns of patients with isolated diastolic hypertension can generate new knowledge and highlight opportunities to improve their care.

Methods and Results

We used data from the China PEACE (Patient‐centered Evaluative Assessment of Cardiac Events) Million Persons Project, which screened 2 351 035 participants aged 35 to 75 years between 2014 and 2018.was defined as systolic and diastolic blood pressure of < 140 and ≥ 90 mm Hg; awareness as self‐reported diagnosis of hypertension; and treatment as current use of antihypertensive medications. Of the 2 310 184 participants included (mean age 55.7 years; 59.5% women); 73 279 (3.2%) had, of whom 63 112 (86.1%) were untreated, and only 6512 (10.3%) of the untreated were aware of having hypertension. When compared with normotensives, participants who were < 60 years, men, at least college educated, had body mass index of > 28 kg/m², consumed alcohol, had diabetes mellitus, and prior cardiovascular events were more likely to have(all P < 0.01). Among those with, higher likelihood of awareness was associated with increased age, women, college education, body mass index of > 28 kg/m², higher income, diabetes mellitus, prior cardiovascular events, and Central or Eastern region (all P < 0.05). Most treated participants withreported taking only 1 class of antihypertensive medication.

Conclusions

affects a substantial number of people in China, however, few are aware of having hypertension and most treated participants are poorly managed, which suggests the need to improve the diagnosis and treatment of people with.

Methods

Study Design, Data Sources, and Study Participants

We analyzed data from the SPRINT study. Anonymized data and materials have been made publicly available at the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's Biologic Specimen and Data Repository Information Coordinating Center and can be accessed at. The SPRINT protocol was approved by the institutional review boards at the participating locations, and all participants gave their informed permission. The procedure for the study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Taipei Veterans General Hospital, and informed consent was waived as the data used were deidentified. This study adhered to Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology guidelines for cohort studies (Data S1).

SPRINTwas an open‐label, randomized controlled trial, which enrolled 9361 participants between 2010 and 2013 aged ≥ 50 years with SBP between 130 and 180 mm Hg, who had an increased cardiovascular risk and no history of diabetes or stroke. The participants were randomly assigned to achieve an SBP goal of < 120 mm Hg (intensive treatment) or < 140 mm Hg (standard treatment). BP measurements and antihypertensive drug adjustments were scheduled monthly for the first 3 months, and every 3 months thereafter. The trial intervention was terminated early in 2015 due to a significantly lower rate of the primary composite outcomes in the intensive treatment group than in the standard treatment group.

Our study used SPRINT data from each participant's initial visit to their final visit. During the intervention and post‐intervention periods, comprehensive participant information was meticulously recorded in the SPRINT data. For instance, demographic information was collected at the outset. During the follow‐up period, clinical and laboratory data were collected at baseline and every 3 months. At each study visit, BP and antihypertensive drug use were recorded.

We selected participants from the SPRINT trial whose SBP readings during treatment were consistently < 130 mm Hg. We identified eligible participants by including those who had at least 2 consecutive SBP readings < 130 mm Hg. Figure Table S1 provides details on the subject selection process. To establish the starting point for follow‐up, we designated the date of the first SBP reading < 130 mm Hg as the index date.

### Treatment and blood pressure control in isolated systolic hypertension vs diastolic hypertension in primary care [^1121U9yB]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2003). Low credibility.

Cross-sectional surveys on prevalence, treatment and control of hypertension could not satisfactorily distinguish between diastolic hypertension and isolated systolic hypertension because the definition of hypertension included patients under pharmacological treatment. We assessed the situation in the two types of hypertension in general practice in Belgium, based on current blood pressure (BP) measurements and on BP prior to the initiation of drug therapy. Participating physicians enrolled the first 15 at least 55-year-old men visiting the surgery, measured their BP and recorded data on medical history including pretreatment BP, drug utilization, cardiovascular risk factors and target organ damage. Diastolic hypertension was defined as diastolic BP ≥ 90 mmHg, irrespective of systolic BP, and isolated systolic hypertension as systolic BP ≥ 140 mmHg and diastolic BP < 90 mmHg. Among 3761 evaluable patients, 74% were hypertensive. Among the 1533 hypertensive patients in whom blood pressure was known prior to treatment (n = 965) or who were untreated at the study visit (n = 568), 1164 had diastolic hypertension and 369 isolated systolic hypertension. The prevalence of antihypertensive treatment was, respectively, 75 and 25% (P < 0.001) in these two types of hypertension. The odds of being treated were independently determined by type of hypertension, severity of hypertension and level of risk (P < 0.001). BP was controlled in 25% of all patients with diastolic hypertension and in 13% of all patients with isolated systolic hypertension (P < 0.001). About half of the treated patients with systolic hypertension were on a diuretic and/or a calcium-channel blocker. In conclusion, isolated systolic hypertension is less frequently treated than diastolic hypertension, overall BP control is poor and actual drug therapy diverges from recommendations based on placebo-controlled intervention trials.

### Prevalence, awareness, and treatment of isolated diastolic hypertension: insights from the China PEACE million persons project [^113FRhor]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Figure 3
Awareness of having hypertension among untreated participants with isolated diastolic hypertension (IDH), isolated systolic hypertension (ISH), and systolic‐diastolic hypertension (SDH), by age group.

Figure 4
Density plots of awareness of having hypertension among untreated participants with isolated diastolic hypertension in 1198 mutually exclusive population subgroups (of at least 200 participants), by age, sex, prior cardiovascular events, history of diabetes mellitus, and urbanity.

We identified several independent factors associated with awareness of having hypertension among untreated IDH participants (Table 4). Awareness was significantly higher among IDH participants who were older, women, had higher income (> 50 000 Yuan/year), were at least college educated, obese, had DM, prior cardiovascular event, and belonged to Central or Eastern region (all P < 0.05). Participant's marital status, occupation, health insurance status, and health behaviors like smoking and alcohol use, were not independently associated with their awareness of having hypertension.

Treatment Patterns Among Treated Participants With IDH

Most treated participants with IDH reported taking 1 antihypertensive medication in both urban and rural areas (Figure 5). Even though use of combination therapy increased slightly with age, < 5% of the participants received ≥ 3 drugs across all age groups. Most treated participants with IDH reported taking Western antihypertensive medications (9969 or 98%). Among IDH participants using 2 or fewer classes of medications, calcium channel blockers (42%) were the most frequent class of medication used, followed by angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (20%), and diuretics (7%), respectively (Table 5). On stratification of IDH patients based on their degree of DBP elevation, we found that the majority (74.7%) had DBP of 90 to 95 mm Hg, followed by 96 to 100 mm Hg (19.6%), and > 100 mm Hg (5.7%), respectively.

### Cardiovascular risk in patients with treated isolated diastolic hypertension and isolated low diastolic blood pressure [^112o8TaD]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The prognosis of high or markedly low diastolic blood pressure (DBP) with normalized on‐treatment systolic blood pressure on major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) is uncertain. This study examined whether treated isolated diastolic hypertension (IDH) and treated isolated low DBP (ILDBP) were associated with MACEs in patients with hypertension.

Methods and Results

A total of 7582 patients with on‐treatment systolic blood pressure < 130 mm Hg from SPRINT (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial) were categorized on the basis of average DBP: < 60 mm Hg (n = 1031; treated ILDBP), 60 to 79 mm Hg (n = 5432), ≥ 80 mm Hg (n = 1119; treated IDH). MACE risk was estimated using Cox proportional‐hazards models. Among the SPRINT participants, median age was 67.0 years and 64.9% were men. Over a median follow‐up of 3.4 years, 512 patients developed a MACE. The incidence of MACEs was 3.9 cases per 100 person‐years for treated ILDBP, 1.9 cases for DBP 60 to 79 mm Hg, and 1.8 cases for treated IDH. Comparing with DBP 60 to 79 mm Hg, treated ILDBP was associated with an 1.32‐fold MACE risk (hazard ratio [HR], 1.32, 95% CI, 1.05–1.66), whereas treated IDH was not (HR, 1.18 [95% CI, 0.87–1.59]). There was no effect modification by age, sex, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk, or cardiovascular disease history (all P values for interaction > 0.05).

Conclusions

In this secondary analysis of SPRINT, among treated patients with normalized systolic blood pressure, excessively low DBP was associated with an increased MACE risk, while treated IDH was not. Further research is required for treated ILDBP management.

### Association of isolated diastolic hypertension as defined by the 2017 ACC / AHA blood pressure guideline with incident cardiovascular outcomes [^112QMvsV]. JAMA (2020). Excellent credibility.

Importance

In the 2017 American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) guideline, the definition of hypertension was lowered from a blood pressure (BP) of greater than or equal to 140/90 to greater than or equal to 130/80 mm Hg. The new diastolic BP threshold of 80 mm Hg was recommended based on expert opinion and changes the definition of isolated diastolic hypertension (IDH).

Objective

To compare the prevalence of IDH in the United States, by 2017 ACC/AHA and 2003 Joint National Committee (JNC7) definitions, and to characterize cross-sectional and longitudinal associations of IDH with outcomes.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Cross-sectional analyses of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES 2013–2016) and longitudinal analyses of the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study (baseline 1990–1992, with follow-up through December 31, 2017). Longitudinal results were validated in 2 external cohorts: (1) the NHANES III (1988–1994) and NHANES 1999–2014 and (2) the Give Us a Clue to Cancer and Heart Disease (CLUE) II cohort (baseline 1989).

Exposures

IDH, by 2017 ACC/AHA (systolic BP < 130 mm Hg, diastolic BP ≥ 80 mm Hg) and by JNC7 (systolic BP < 140 mm Hg, diastolic BP ≥ 90 mm Hg) definitions.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Weighted estimates for prevalence of IDH in US adults and prevalence of US adults recommended BP pharmacotherapy by the 2017 ACC/AHA guideline based solely on the presence of IDH. Risk of incident atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), heart failure (HF), and chronic kidney disease (CKD) in the ARIC Study.

Results

The study population included 9590 adults from the NHANES (mean [SD] baseline age, 49.6 [17.6] years; 5016 women [52.3%]) and 8703 adults from the ARIC Study (mean [SD] baseline age, 56.0 [5.6] years; 4977 women [57.2%]). The estimated prevalence of IDH in the NHANES was 6.5% by the 2017 ACC/AHA definition and 1.3% by the JNC7 definition (absolute difference, 5.2% [95% CI, 4.7%-5.7%]). Among those newly classified as having IDH, an estimated 0.6% (95% CI, 0.5%-0.6%) also met the guideline threshold for antihypertensive therapy. Compared with normotensive ARIC participants, IDH by the 2017 ACC/AHA definition was not significantly associated with incident ASCVD (n = 1386 events; median follow-up, 25.2 years; hazard ratio [HR], 1.06 [95% CI, 0.89–1.26]), HF (n = 1396 events; HR, 0.91 [95% CI, 0.76–1.09]), or CKD (n = 2433 events; HR, 0.98 [95% CI, 0.65–1.11]). Results were also null for cardiovascular mortality in the 2 external cohorts (eg, HRs of IDH by the 2017 ACC/AHA definition were 1.17 [95% CI, 0.87–1.56] in the NHANES [n = 1012 events] and 1.02 [95% CI, 0.92–1.14] in CLUE II [n = 1497 events]).

Conclusions and Relevance

In this analysis of US adults, the estimated prevalence of IDH was more common when defined by the 2017 ACC/AHA BP guideline compared with the JNC7 guideline. However, IDH was not significantly associated with increased risk for cardiovascular outcomes.

### Cardiovascular outcomes associated with isolated systolic or diastolic hypertension according to the 2017 AHA / ACC guideline in adult cancer survivors [^116fnFWb]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

In 2022 the GLOBOCAN (Global Cancer Observatory) reported 20 million new cancer cases worldwide, marking a nearly 40% increase from 2012. Advancements in cancer treatment and screening technologies are expected to contribute to the growing number of cancer survivors. These cancer survivors are at higher risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), partially attributable to treatment‐related cardiotoxicity, cancer‐associated inflammation, and shared risk factors such as hypertension. Notably, isolated systolic or diastolic hypertension are increasingly recognized as independent risk factors for CVD, highlighting the importance of considering both systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP) for specified CVD risk assessment. Therefore, effective CVD prevention strategies tailored to individualize and optimize risk stratification are necessary for adult cancer survivors. However, CVD risk associated with the 2017 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology (AHA/ACC) BP guideline for isolated systolic or diastolic hypertension remains understudied in a broad spectrum of adult cancer survivors.

### Blood pressure goals in acute stroke [^1174N4RT]. American Journal of Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

Hypertension remains the most powerful risk factor of stroke worldwideand in the stroke prone population in Asia, irrespective of its subtype, either hemorrhagic or ischemic. Antihypertensive drug treatment is highly effective in primary prevention of stroke in patients with hypertension. Current hypertension guidelines recommend initiation of antihypertensive drug treatment in patients with conventionally defined hypertension (systolic/diastolic blood pressure ≥ 140/90 mm Hg)and in high-risk patients with hypertension newly defined in the American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines (≥ 130/80 mm Hg). In most guidelines, blood pressure is recommended to reduce to a level below 140/90 mm Hg and if possible and tolerable to 130/80 mm Hg or even lower. The ACC/AHA guidelines recommend a universal blood pressure goal of 130/80 mm Hg. In fact, the relationship between blood pressure and the risk of stroke is linear and direct, regardless whether blood pressure is measured in the officeor out-of-office setting. In addition, the benefit of antihypertensive drug treatment is greater for the prevention of stroke than for other clinical outcomes, such as coronary events. Indeed, the relative risk reduction for approximately each 10/5 mm Hg reduction in systolic/diastolic blood pressure was about 42% for stroke and 14% for coronary events in patients with systolic and diastolic hypertension. The corresponding risk reductions in patients with isolated systolic hypertension were 30% and 23%, respectively. No J-curve has ever been observed for stroke, as for other clinical outcomes such as coronary events.

### Hypertension management and control among english adults aged 65 years and older in 2000 and 2001 [^113XR6Pg]. Journal of Hypertension (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe blood pressures, and hypertension and its management among older people.

Design

Two combined annual cross-sectional surveys.

Setting

England 2000 and 2001.

Participants

Nationally-representative sample of 3513 non-institutionalized people aged more than 64 years (elderly).

Main Outcome Measures

(1). Use of antihypertensive agents, and hypertension according to two definitions: receiving blood pressure decreasing treatment, or either: systolic blood pressure ≥ 160 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 90 mmHg (old); or systolic blood pressure ≥ 140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 90 mmHg (new). (2). Rates of treatment and control (old: < 160/90 mmHg; new: < 140/85 mmHg). (3). Isolated systolic hypertension stage 1 (systolic blood pressure ≥ 140–159 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg), or stage 2 (systolic blood pressure ≥ 160 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg).

Results

In 2000/2001, 62 and 81% of elderly adults were hypertensive according to the old and new definitions, respectively. Among those with hypertension (new definition) treatment and control rates were 56 and 19% (control rates among those treated were 36% in men and 30% in women). Of those treated, 54% were receiving one drug, 35% were receiving two, and 10% were receiving three or more drugs. Among untreated hypertensive individuals, 23% had increased systolic and diastolic pressures, 76% had isolated systolic hypertension and 1% had isolated diastolic hypertension.

Conclusions

These data suggest that, according to current guidelines more than 67% of older English adults should receive antihypertensive medication. To pre-empt this situation, population-based strategies to reduce the current rate of increase in blood pressure throughout adult life should be urgently implemented. Only then will the current epidemic of hypertension among the elderly, with the huge cost associated with its management and adverse cardiovascular sequelae, be averted.

### Association of isolated diastolic hypertension based on the cutoff value in the 2017 American college of cardiology / American Heart Association blood pressure guidelines with subsequent cardiovascular events in the general population [^113yTiMa]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Hypertension is a major cause of cardiovascular disease (CVD) 1, 2, 3 and is diagnosed based on both systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP). The 2017 American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines for hypertension lowered the threshold of blood pressure (BP) from 140/90 mm Hg to 130/80 mm Hg. 4 However, the 2018 European Society of Cardiology/European Society of Hypertension guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension retained the cutoff value of BP for hypertension at 140/90 mm Hg. 5 Although several studies confirmed the validity of the updated ACC/AHA classification of BP, 6, 7 lowering the threshold of diastolic BP to 80 mm Hg was based on expert opinion. 8 Further, there have been conflicting data regarding the influence of DBP on subsequent cardiovascular events. 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 Particularly, McEvoy et al 9 recently indicated that isolated diastolic hypertension (IDH) according to the cutoff value of DBP, which the 2017 ACC/AHA guidelines suggested was not significantly associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular events. Therefore, the cutoff value of DBP in the 2017 ACC/AHA guidelines is still under debate, and further investigation is warranted to verify the validity of these guidelines. In this study, we sought to explore the association of IDH based on the cutoff value of DBP, which the 2017 ACC/AHA guidelines indicated with the risk of subsequent cardiovascular events among the general population without a prevalent history of CVD using a nationwide epidemiological database.

### Isolated diastolic vs. systolic hypertension phenotypes and outcomes: prospective cohort of newly diagnosed individuals with hypertension [^1158GoL4]. Journal of Hypertension (2021). Medium credibility.

Aims

To evaluate whether different hypertension phenotypes, namely, isolated systolic hypertension (ISH), isolated diastolic hypertension (IDH) and systolic/diastolic hypertension (SDH) have a differential outcome effect by clinic and ambulatory blood pressure (BP) measurements.

Methods

We prospectively evaluated in 569 never-treated patients with sustained hypertension (age 52.6 ± 11.6 years; men 55%; clinic BP 150 ± 15/95.5 ± 10mmHg, systolic/diastolic; 24-h ambulatory BP 128.9 ± 12.6/80.6 ± 9.7) the incidence of major cardiovascular (CV) events within 5 years, after adjustment for confounders, including the rate of BP control and the weighted follow-up BP.

Results

All participants received antihypertensive drug treatment (mean number of drugs 1.9 ± 1.1; follow-up visits 4.6/patient). Average clinic BP achieved during follow-up was 136 ± 12.6/83.9 ± 9.4mmHg, with 39% of participants having clinic BP less than 140/90mmHg in at least 75% of their visits, and 24% in 25–75% of visits. Prevalence of hypertension phenotypes defined using BP differed from that using ambulatory BP, whereas integration of both BP measurements reclassified the initial phenotype to another in 18% of participants. Although, no differential outcome effect was observed between clinic IDH and SDH assessed using clinic or ambulatory BP measurements, clinic BP-based ISH was associated with a higher outcome incidence than the IDH and SDH phenotypes (hazard ratio 4.8, 95% confidence interval 1.4–17.0, P = 0.015). ISH diagnosed by integration of clinic and ambulatory BP, also increased the outcome (hazard ratio 4.0, 95% confidence interval 1.0–15.6, P = 0.046).

Conclusion

In hypertensive patients at low/moderate CV risk, IDH and SDH phenotypes defined by clinic BP measurements, equally determined CV events but to a lower extent compared with ISH.

### Self-reported hypertension treatment beliefs and practices of primary care physicians in a managed care organization [^116yuGFU]. American Journal of Hypertension (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Blood pressure (BP) is controlled to recommended goal in less than one-third of people with hypertension. There has been little recent research on physician beliefs and practices with regard to the treatment of hypertension.

Methods

In late 1999, we surveyed 104 primary care physicians in the 18 owned clinics of a large staff model, non-profit health maintenance organization. The survey included questions about demographics, BP treatment goals for patients with uncomplicated hypertension, and beliefs about hypertension.

Results

The reported systolic BP treatment goal was ≤ 140 mm Hg for 97% and the diastolic BP goal was ≤ 90 mm Hg for 100%. The systolic BP goal for patients with isolated systolic hypertension was ≤ 140 mm Hg for 82%, but 34% stated that they would treat to a different goal depending on the diastolic BP. The proportions of physicians who would intensify treatment for BP of 140/90 mm Hg, 150/95 mm Hg, 165/75 mm Hg, and 165/65 mm Hg were 64%, 97%, 89% and 77%, respectively. Although 93% believed that medication was necessary to control BP in most cases, a majority (55%) agreed with the statement that BP could be controlled in most patients with only one drug. Although 42% reported that they often had to change drugs because of side effects, only 16% believed that it was time-consuming to find a well-tolerated drug regimen.

Conclusions

In this setting, primary care physicians' self-reported practices were in good agreement with national guidelines put forth in the late 1990s, and their beliefs were favorable to therapy. Our data point to a need for interventions to emphasize that combination drug therapy is frequently required to achieve BP control, and that more aggressive intervention is often warranted for isolated systolic hypertension.

### Underdiagnosis of isolated systolic and isolated diastolic hypertension [^111oXnv6]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Systolic and diastolic hypertension independently predict the risk of adverse cardiovascular events. It remains unclear how systolic pressure, diastolic pressure, and other patient characteristics influence the initial diagnosis of hypertension. Here, we use a cohort of 146,816 adults in a large healthcare system to examine how elevated systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure measurements influence initial diagnosis of hypertension and how other patient characteristics influence the diagnosis. Thirty-four percent of the cohort were diagnosed with hypertension within 1 year. In multivariable logistic regression of the diagnosis of hypertension, controlling for covariates, isolated systolic hypertensive measures (odds ratio [OR] 0.42 [95% confidence interval {CI} 0.41 to 0.43]) and isolated diastolic hypertensive measures (OR 0.32 [95% CI 0.31 to 0.33]) were less likely to lead to hypertension diagnosis when compared with combined hypertensive measures. Higher levels of systolic blood pressure had a greater impact on hypertension diagnosis (OR 1.77 [95% CI 1.75 to 1.79] per Z-score) than did higher levels of diastolic blood pressure (OR 1.34 [95% CI 1.32 to 1.36] per Z-score). Older age, non-white race/ethnicity, and medical comorbidities all predicted the establishment of a diagnosis of hypertension. Isolated systolic and isolated diastolic hypertension are underdiagnosed in clinical practice, and several patient-centered factors also strongly influence whether a diagnosis is made. In conclusion, our findings uncover a care gap that can be closed with increased attention to the independent influence of systolic and diastolic hypertension and the various patient-centered factors that may impact hypertension diagnosis.

### Phenotypes of hypertension: impact of age and sex on hemodynamic mechanisms [^117PrqjH]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Essential hypertension is often treated as a uniform condition. However, it encompasses distinct patterns of blood pressure elevation such as isolated systolic, systolic diastolic, and isolated diastolic hypertension, which vary in prevalence according to age and sex. We hypothesized that different hemodynamic mechanisms account for the age- and sex-related differences in these hypertensive phenotypes.

Methods

In this cross-sectional analysis of the ACCT (Anglo-Cardiff Collaborative Trial), 5371 individuals (2402 male), aged 18 to 92years, free of cardiovascular disease and medication were included. Blood pressure, cardiac output, stroke volume, peripheral vascular resistance (PVR), and aortic pulse wave velocity were measured. Within each sex, subjects were stratified according to age (< 30, 30–60, and > 60years), and blood pressure phenotype based on clinic (seated) blood pressure.

Results

Isolated systolic hypertension was the most common hypertensive phenotype in young men and characterized by an elevated cardiac output and stroke volume. In contrast, systolic diastolic hypertension and isolated diastolic hypertension were more common in younger females, with systolic diastolic hypertension associated with elevated PVR and aortic pulse wave velocity, and isolated diastolic hypertension with increased PVR. Systolic diastolic hypertension was the most common phenotype in middle age and accompanied by increased PVR in both sexes. Isolated systolic hypertension was again the most common phenotype in older individuals. However, in contrast to younger adults, isolated systolic hypertension affected both men and women equally (~1:1) and was characterized by elevated aortic pulse wave velocity and PVR.

Conclusions

Different hypertensive phenotypes are characterized by distinct hemodynamic mechanisms in an age- and sex-dependent manner. Targeting therapy toward primary hemodynamic abnormalities could lead to more effective interventions in essential hypertension.

ESC/ESH 2018 hypertension — definition and office blood pressure (BP) classification thresholds are as follows: Hypertension is defined as office SBP ≥ 140 mmHg and/or DBP ≥ 90 mmHg. Office BP categories are defined by systolic/diastolic ranges: Optimal < 120 and < 80; Normal 120–129 and/or 80–84; High normal 130–139 and/or 85–89; Grade 1 hypertension 140–159 and/or 90–99; Grade 2 hypertension 160–179 and/or 100–109; Grade 3 hypertension ≥ 180 and/or ≥ 110; Isolated systolic hypertension ≥ 140 and < 90. The same classification is used for all ages from 16 years.

### Harmonization of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association and European Society of Cardiology / European Society of Hypertension blood pressure / hypertension guidelines [^11765MTX]. European Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

BP Classification

The most obvious difference between the 2 guidelines is their approach to BP classification and the BP cut points recommended for the identification of hypertension (Table 4). The ACC/AHA proposes categories for normal BP, elevated BP, and 2 stages of hypertension, with a cut point of systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≥ 130 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) ≥ 80 mm Hg for identification of hypertension. This is a change from the preceding 2003 Joint National Committee 7 CPG, which recommended use of an SBP and/or DBP cut point of 140 and/or 90 mm Hg, except in adults with diabetes mellitus (DM) or chronic kidney disease (CKD), where an SBP and/or DBP cut point of 130 and/or 80 mm Hg was recommended. The ESC/ESH classifies BP into optimal BP, normal BP, high normal BP, 3 grades of systolic/diastolic hypertension, and isolated systolic hypertension. It retains the same SBP ≥ 140 mm Hg and/or DBP ≥ 90 mm Hg cut points for diagnosis of hypertension recommended in the preceding 2013 ESH/ESC hypertension CPG.

Table 4
Blood Pressure Classification

The potential US population impact of the ACC/AHA guideline was estimated by an analysis of the 2011 to 2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. In this analysis, 24.1% of US adults ≥ 20 years of age reported that they were taking antihypertensive medication and were therefore considered to have hypertension. Of those not taking antihypertensive medication, 7.7% had an SBP ≥ 140 mm Hg or DBP ≥ 90 mm Hg, and 13.7% had an SBP 130 to 139 mm Hg or DBP 80 to 89 mm Hg, yielding a 46% prevalence of hypertension for adults using the SBP ≥ 130 mm Hg and/or DBP ≥ 80 mm Hg cut points, or taking antihypertensive medication definition of hypertension compared with a prevalence of 32% using the SBP ≥ 140 mm Hg and/or DBP ≥ 90 mm Hg, or taking antihypertensive medication definition. Prevalence estimates using the 2 definitions of hypertension were more discrepant at younger age than at older age, and in men compared with women. Taken altogether, the ACC/AHA reclassification of BP resulted in an estimated population increase in hypertension prevalence of ≈14%. The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey analyses, however, are likely to overestimate hypertension prevalence because participant BP was only measured on a single occasion and presumed hypertension was not confirmed by out-of-office BP readings.

### Diagnostic and therapeutic problems of isolated systolic hypertension [^111dsANr]. Journal of Hypertension (2015). Low credibility.

Prevalence of isolated systolic hypertension increases with age, due to progressive elevation of SBP, and is a major risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Extensive research has shown that lowering SBP improves cardiovascular outcomes in patients with isolated systolic hypertension, yet SBP control rates remain largely inadequate regardless of antihypertensive treatment. Arterial stiffness is a major determinant of elevated SBP resulting from structural changes in the vascular system, mediated by neurohormonal alterations that occur with vascular ageing. Clinical data have demonstrated an independent association between arterial stiffness and cardiovascular outcomes. Therefore, arterial stiffness has the potential to be an important therapeutic target in the management of isolated systolic hypertension. Current antihypertensive treatments have limited effects on arterial stiffness, so the development of new treatments addressing neurohormonal alterations central to vascular ageing is important. Such therapies may represent effective strategies in the future management of SBP.

### Effects of the antihypertensive fixed-dose combinations on an early marker of hypertensive cardiac damage in subjects at low cardiovascular risk [^114CSg1v]. American Journal of Hypertension (2016). Low credibility.

Background

In hypertensive subjects (HTs), isolated left ventricular diastolic dysfunction (LVDD) is an early marker of cardiac damage and is associated with poor prognosis. However, few intervention trials investigated the effects of antihypertensive therapy on isolated LVDD regression. This study investigates the blood pressure (BP)-lowering efficacy and the effect on LVDD of antihypertensive drugs administered as fixed-dose combinations in untreated HTs with isolated LVDD.

Methods

A total of 168 HTs (23% of them having impaired fasting glucose (IFG)) aged 48 ± 4.2 years were randomized to receive open-label once-daily oral treatment of beta-blocker + diuretic, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) + diuretic, angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) + diuretic, ARB + calcium channel blocker (CCB), or ACEI + CCB. Clinic and 24-hour ambulatory BP values were measured before randomization and at the follow-up. Regression of LVDD was defined as normalization of both the E/A (ratio of early-to-late ventricular filling wave velocity) and E/E' (mitral velocity to early diastolic velocity of the mitral annulus) ratios. Comparisons were made between categorical variables using the χ² test and between continuous variables by gender using analysis of variance for repeated measures.

Results

BP reduction did not differ between groups. LVDD regression was significantly more prevalent in the ARB + CCB or ACEI + CCB groups than with other combinations; in HTs with IFG, it was most prevalent (46%) with ACEI + CCB.

Conclusions

Independently of BP reduction, the fixed-dose combinations ARB + CCB and ACEI + CCB led to regression of isolated LVDD. In those with an IFG, ACEI + CCB was most effective.

### Systolic and diastolic hypertension among patients on hemodialysis: musings on volume overload, arterial stiffness, and erythropoietin [^116czPAb]. Seminars in Dialysis (2019). Medium credibility.

Hypertension among patients on hemodialysis is predominantly systolic (either isolated or combined with diastolic hypertension), whereas the scenario of isolated diastolic hypertension is rare and more common in younger patients. Uncontrolled hypertension that persists despite aggressive antihypertensive drug therapy is a reflection of the volume overload that is a prominent mediator of systolic and diastolic BP elevation. Clinical-trial evidence supports the notion that dry-weight probing is an effective strategy to improve BP control, even when overt clinical signs and symptoms of volume overload are not present. Accelerated arterial stiffness influences the patterns and rhythms of interdialytic ambulatory BP and is a major determinant of isolated systolic hypertension in hemodialysis. Posthoc analyses of the Hypertension in Hemodialysis patients treated with Atenolol or Lisinopril (HDPAL) trial, however, suggest that arterial stiffness does not make hypertension more resistant to therapy and is unable to predict the treatment-induced improvement in left ventricular hypertrophy. A combined strategy of sodium restriction, dry-weight adjustment, and antihypertensive medication use was effective in improving ambulatory BP control regardless of the severity of underlying arteriosclerosis in HDPAL. Other nonvolume-dependent mechanisms, such as erythropoietin use, appear to be also important contributors and should be taken into consideration, particularly in younger hemodialysis patients with diastolic hypertension. In this article, we explore the role of volume overload, arterial stiffness, and erythropoietin use as causes of systolic vs diastolic hypertension in patients on hemodialysis. We conclude with clinical practice recommendations and with a call for a "volume-first" approach when managing hemodialysis hypertension.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2017 ACC / AHA hypertension guideline [^111pVmc2]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2019). High credibility.

ACC/AHA hypertension — pharmacologic treatment thresholds specify that use of BP-lowering medications is recommended for secondary prevention of recurrent cardiovascular disease (CVD) events in patients with clinical CVD and an average systolic BP (SBP) of 130 mm Hg or higher or an average diastolic BP (DBP) of 80 mm Hg or higher, and for primary prevention in adults with an estimated 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk of 10% or higher and an average SBP 130 mm Hg or higher or an average DBP 80 mm Hg or higher (COR I, LOE: A for SBP; C-EO for DBP). It is also recommended for primary prevention in adults with no history of CVD and with an estimated 10-year ASCVD risk < 10% and an SBP of 140 mm Hg or higher or a DBP of 90 mm Hg or higher (COR I, LOE C-LD).

### Hypertension pharmacological treatment in adults: a World Health Organization guideline executive summary [^113geTEx]. Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death worldwide, with most deaths attributed to hypertension resulting from coronary heart disease or stroke and more than three quarters of these deaths occurring in low- and middle-income countries. The level of high blood pressure (BP) is directly related to many adverse outcomes, including CVD and kidney disease. Conversely, clinical trials have repeatedly demonstrated that lowering BP in adults with high baseline BP level provides an effective means for preventing CVD. Definitions of hypertension are useful for clinical decision-making and are typically based on CVD risk and level of BP at which antihypertensive medication is effective for preventing CVD. A common definition of hypertension is based on an average systolic BP (SBP) ≥ 140 mm Hg, diastolic BP (DBP) ≥ 90 mm Hg, or self-reported use of antihypertensive medication. Using this definition, it has been estimated that ≈1.4 billion adults have hypertension, worldwide, but < 14% have their BP controlled with antihypertensive drug therapy to an SBP/DBP < 140/90 mm Hg (< 8% in low- and middle-income countries). Even more disturbing is the recent trend in a high-income country (the United States), where rate of hypertension control to an SBP/DBP < 140/90 mm Hg reached a high of close to 54% in 2013 to 2014, but dramatically eroded to < 44% in 2017 to 2018. Given this decrease, the Surgeon General of the United States issued a report for a "Call to Action to Control Hypertension" making the control of hypertension a national priority.

Methods

Study Design and Data Source

We conducted this retrospective observational analysis using the health claims database of the Japan Medical Data Center (JMDC; Tokyo, Japan), which has been described in detail in previous reports. 15, 16, 17 The JMDC collects data from > 60 insurers and includes data for health insurance claims on insured individuals. More than 5 million individuals were registered in this database. Most individuals registered in the JMDC database are employees of relatively large companies in Japan. The JMDC database includes annual health checkup data including a questionnaire regarding medical history and status of medications and laboratory data. Data of clinical follow‐up from the first health checkup obtained by claim records are also included in the JMDC database. This database is available for anyone who purchases it from the JMDC.

Ethics

This study was approved by the institutional review board of the University of Tokyo (2018‐10862) in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. The requirement for informed consent was waived because of the anonymous nature of the JMDC database.

Definition

Incidence of CVD including myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, and stroke was evaluated using the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD‐10) diagnosis codes recorded in the claim records of each individual. 18 The primary end point was defined as a composite end point including myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, and stroke. Generally, healthcare professionals such as nurses measured the BP of resting individuals twice at health checkups according to the procedure recommended by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, and the Japanese Society of Cardiovascular Disease Prevention. The average of 2 measurements was recorded. We defined normal DBP as < 80 mm Hg (and SBP < 130 mmHg) stage 1 IDH as 80 mm Hg ≤ DBP < 90 mm Hg (and SBP < 130 mm Hg), and stage 2 IDH as DBP ≥ 90 mm Hg (and SBP < 130 mm Hg). Obesity was defined as body mass index ≥ 25 kg/m² according to the criteria of the Japan Society for the Study of Obesity. 19 Abdominal obesity was defined as a waist circumference ≥ 85 cm for men and ≥ 90 cm for women. 20 Diabetes mellitus was defined as a fasting glucose level ≥ 126 mg/dL or ongoing antidiabetic therapy. Dyslipidemia was defined as low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol ≥ 140 mg/dL or high‐density lipoprotein cholesterol < 40 mg/dL or triglycerides ≥ 150 mg/dL or ongoing lipid‐lowering therapy.

### Debate on the 2025 guideline for the prevention, detection, evaluation, and management of high blood pressure in adults: emphasis on defense against the BP threshold and why we may not get there easily [^114J7Li3]. Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

Elevated blood pressure (BP) is the most important noncommunicable disorder worldwide. Finding and effectively managing elevated BP is the single greatest public health benefit we can accomplish, as it will reduce premature death and enable patients to live longer free of the disabilities that target organ damage inflicts on the brain, heart, kidneys, and legs. Hypertension guidelines are an invaluable source of information on how to detect elevated BP, how to evaluate people for situations where hypertension is a symptom of other disorders, and how to apply the various treatments that lower BP effectively in patients. Determining the point at which treating high BP is more likely to result in benefit than harm is a marriage of science and art. There is no right answer to what clearly constitutes hypertension when using a systolic or diastolic BP to define it. The science shows the mathematics behind the reduction of BP and the number of lives saved and target organs preserved. The art comes into play when a decision is made that, when a systolic or diastolic BP exceeds a certain level, it becomes reasonable to intervene at that point with treatment. Caregivers play an important role in monitoring and educating patients with hypertension-especially in the detection of unintended effects of treatment, such as excessive BP lowering, symptomatic hypotension, and impacts on laboratory tests and well-being. Nonadherence to prescribed therapies is a barrier to effectively managing chronic disorders like hypertension. Having a solid foundation in the science behind the guidelines and recognizing that the application of guidelines requires some clinical judgment gleaned from balancing the risks and benefits of treatment in each individual patient, is the basis for healthy exchanges of ideas, like this pro and con series which discusses the science and furthers the art. This review has taken the con side of several issues in the latest American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association 2025 Hypertension Guidelines.

### First-line drugs for hypertension [^115FQHjS]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

This is the first update of a review published in 2009. Sustained moderate to severe elevations in resting blood pressure leads to a critically important clinical question: What class of drug to use first-line? This review attempted to answer that question.

Objectives

To quantify the mortality and morbidity effects from different first-line antihypertensive drug classes: thiazides (low-dose and high-dose), beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB), and alpha-blockers, compared to placebo or no treatment. Secondary objectives: when different antihypertensive drug classes are used as the first-line drug, to quantify the blood pressure lowering effect and the rate of withdrawal due to adverse drug effects, compared to placebo or no treatment.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomized controlled trials up to November 2017: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov. We contacted authors of relevant papers regarding further published and unpublished work.

Selection Criteria

Randomized trials (RCT) of at least one year duration, comparing one of six major drug classes with a placebo or no treatment, in adult patients with blood pressure over 140/90 mmHg at baseline. The majority (over 70%) of the patients in the treatment group were taking the drug class of interest after one year. We included trials with both hypertensive and normotensive patients in this review if the majority (over 70%) of patients had elevated blood pressure, or the trial separately reported outcome data on patients with elevated blood pressure.

Data Collection and Analysis

The outcomes assessed were mortality, stroke, coronary heart disease (CHD), total cardiovascular events (CVS), decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and withdrawals due to adverse drug effects. We used a fixed-effect model to to combine dichotomous outcomes across trials and calculate risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). We presented blood pressure data as mean difference (MD) with 99% CI.

Main Results

The 2017 updated search failed to identify any new trials. The original review identified 24 trials with 28 active treatment arms, including 58,040 patients. We found no RCTs for ARBs or alpha-blockers. These results are mostly applicable to adult patients with moderate to severe primary hypertension. The mean age of participants was 56 years, and mean duration of follow-up was three to five years. High-quality evidence showed that first-line low-dose thiazides reduced mortality (11.0% with control versus 9.8% with treatment; RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.82 to 0.97); total CVS (12.9% with control versus 9.0% with treatment; RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.76), stroke (6.2% with control versus 4.2% with treatment; RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.77), and coronary heart disease (3.9% with control versus 2.8% with treatment; RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.84). Low- to moderate-quality evidence showed that first-line high-dose thiazides reduced stroke (1.9% with control versus 0.9% with treatment; RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.61) and total CVS (5.1% with control versus 3.7% with treatment; RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.82), but did not reduce mortality (3.1% with control versus 2.8% with treatment; RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.05), or coronary heart disease (2.7% with control versus 2.7% with treatment; RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.20). Low- to moderate-quality evidence showed that first-line beta-blockers did not reduce mortality (6.2% with control versus 6.0% with treatment; RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.07) or coronary heart disease (4.4% with control versus 3.9% with treatment; RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.03), but reduced stroke (3.4% with control versus 2.8% with treatment; RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.97) and total CVS (7.6% with control versus 6.8% with treatment; RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.98). Low- to moderate-quality evidence showed that first-line ACE inhibitors reduced mortality (13.6% with control versus 11.3% with treatment; RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.95), stroke (6.0% with control versus 3.9% with treatment; RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.82), coronary heart disease (13.5% with control versus 11.0% with treatment; RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.94), and total CVS (20.1% with control versus 15.3% with treatment; RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.85). Low-quality evidence showed that first-line calcium channel blockers reduced stroke (3.4% with control versus 1.9% with treatment; RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.84) and total CVS (8.0% with control versus 5.7% with treatment; RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.87), but not coronary heart disease (3.1% with control versus 2.4% with treatment; RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.09), or mortality (6.0% with control versus 5.1% with treatment; RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.09). There was low-quality evidence that withdrawals due to adverse effects were increased with first-line low-dose thiazides (5.0% with control versus 11.3% with treatment; RR 2.38, 95% CI 2.06 to 2.75), high-dose thiazides (2.2% with control versus 9.8% with treatment; RR 4.48, 95% CI 3.83 to 5.24), and beta-blockers (3.1% with control versus 14.4% with treatment; RR 4.59, 95% CI 4.11 to 5.13). No data for these outcomes were available for first-line ACE inhibitors or calcium channel blockers. The blood pressure data were not used to assess the effect of the different classes of drugs as the data were heterogeneous, and the number of drugs used in the trials differed.

Authors' Conclusions

First-line low-dose thiazides reduced all morbidity and mortality outcomes in adult patients with moderate to severe primary hypertension. First-line ACE inhibitors and calcium channel blockers may be similarly effective, but the evidence was of lower quality. First-line high-dose thiazides and first-line beta-blockers were inferior to first-line low-dose thiazides.

### US hypertension management guidelines: a review of the recent past and recommendations for the future [^114eZ6aq]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Hypertension affects ≈29% of the US adult population, an estimated 72 million people, with a prevalence of > 65% in persons older than 60 years. 1, 2 It is an important risk factor for myocardial infarction (MI), heart failure (HF), stroke, and cardiovascular disease (CVD), accounting for ≈41% of all CVD deaths. 3, 4 Indeed, there is a known graded relationship between increasing blood pressure (BP) and the risk of CVD, starting at 115/75 mm Hg. 5 Based on observational data, an increase in BP of 20 mm Hg systolic or 10 mm Hg diastolic is associated with a doubling of the risk of CVD death, regardless of age. 5 Further, hypertension in middle age is known to increase the risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and dementia in later life, an important issue given the aging demographic in Western societies. 6 Finally, despite the fact that BP recognition and control are improving, it is concerning that nearly half of the hypertensive population remains suboptimally controlled. 2

With the 2003 Joint National Committee's seventh report (JNC 7) becoming increasingly outdated and the 2011 Institute of Medicine report calling for high‐quality evidence‐based guidelines, 7, 8 the Eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8) was initially appointed to create an updated treatment guideline for hypertension under the auspices of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Although the NIH ultimately withdrew from the guideline development process at a late stage in the development of JNC 8, the panel decided, nonetheless, to publish their recommendations independently.

The panel aimed to answer 3 questions: Does initiating antihypertensive treatment at specific BP thresholds improve health outcomes? Does treatment with antihypertensive therapy to a specific BP goal improve health outcomes? Are there differences in benefit/harm between antihypertensive drugs or drug classes on specific health outcomes? The committee focused exclusively on large, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) as supporting evidence, although 5 of the 9 recommendations in the final report were ultimately based on expert opinion. Partly in response to JNC 8, the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and American Heart Association (AHA) are now in the process of developing official hypertension guidelines. In this review, we discuss the basis of each recommendation from the JNC 8 panel, provide additional insights, and compare these recommendations with guidelines from other professional societies to generate suggestions for the new AHA/ACC hypertension guideline committee.

### 2018 ESC / ESH guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension [^115yQsni]. European Heart Journal (2018). Medium credibility.

Isolated systolic hypertension in the young — definition, risk, and management — recognizes that "some young, healthy people, and men in particular, may present with isolated grade 1 systolic hypertension (i.e. brachial SBP ≥ 140–159 mmHg and a normal DBP < 90 mmHg) and this may be associated with a normal central aortic SBP due to excessive peripheral systolic pressure amplification". Prognosis is uncertain because "it is unclear whether isolated systolic hypertension in the context of a normal aortic pressure is benign", though prospective data showed "young men with isolated systolic hypertension had a CV risk similar to that of individuals with high–normal BP" and the condition "was closely associated with smoking". Management emphasizes lifestyle and surveillance: "these young individuals should receive recommendations on lifestyle modification (particularly cessation of smoking); whether they should receive drug treatment is unclear, but they do require longer-term follow-up as many will develop sustained hypertension".

### Do the combined blood pressure effects of exercise and antihypertensive medications add up to the sum of their parts? A systematic meta-review [^112M556J]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Hypertension is the most predominant risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) affecting nearly one in two adults in the United States; while CVD is the leading cause of death and disability in the United States and world accounting for one in three deaths. Zanchetti et al performed a meta-analysis (MA) of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and found antihypertensive medication use reduced all major types of cardiovascular events and death. Indeed, pharmacological treatment generated reductions in systolic blood pressure (SBP) of 9–10 mm Hg and diastolic BP (DBP) of 4–5 mm Hg decreased the relative risk for all-cause mortality by 11%, cardiovascular morality by 16%, coronary heart disease by 18% and stroke by 36%. Exercise is also recommended as antihypertensive lifestyle therapy because it lowers BP 5–8 mm Hg among adults with hypertension, prevents the development of hypertensionand reduces cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Despite the well-established BP benefits of antihypertensive medications and exercise to prevent, treat and control hypertension, little is known about their comparative BP effects alone and combined in the treatment of hypertension.

Two recent network MAs (NMA) addressed this important knowledge gap with slightly different findings. Naci et al were the first to compare the BP lowering effects of exercise vs medications on SBP among healthy adults with normal BP, prehypertension and hypertension. They found aerobic and dynamic resistance exercise performed alone or combined reduced SBP by ~9 mm Hg among adults with hypertension, with no detectable difference in the magnitude of the SBP reductions to those resulting from antihypertensive medications. Noone et al were the second to compare the BP-lowering effects of exercise and medications among adults with hypertension on BP in RCTs with a sample size of > 20 participants. They concluded there was insufficient evidence to suggest antihypertensive medications were better than exercise in lowering BP. Despite the efforts of these two investigative teams to directly compare the effectiveness of exercise and medication as antihypertensive therapeutic options, the authors acknowledged the exercise arms contained participants treated with medication so that the BP effects reported were not necessarily due to exercise per se, and RCTs that directly compared exercise to medications were not included.

### Hypertension pharmacological treatment in adults: a World Health Organization guideline executive summary [^116K17V8]. Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

Hypertension is a major cause of cardiovascular disease and deaths worldwide especially in low- and middle-income countries. Despite the availability of safe, well-tolerated, and cost-effective blood pressure (BP)-lowering therapies, < 14% of adults with hypertension have BP controlled to a systolic/diastolic BP < 140/90 mmHg. We report new hypertension treatment guidelines, developed in accordance with the World Health Organization Handbook for Guideline Development. Overviews of reviews of the evidence were conducted and summary tables were developed according to the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations approach. In these guidelines, the World Health Organization provides the most current and relevant evidence-based guidance for the pharmacological treatment of nonpregnant adults with hypertension. The recommendations pertain to adults with an accurate diagnosis of hypertension who have already received lifestyle modification counseling. The guidelines recommend BP threshold to initiate pharmacological therapy, BP treatment targets, intervals for follow-up visits, and best use of health care workers in the management of hypertension. The guidelines provide guidance for choice of monotherapy or dual therapy, treatment with single pill combination medications, and use of treatment algorithms for hypertension management. Strength of the recommendations was guided by the quality of the underlying evidence; the tradeoffs between desirable and undesirable effects; patient's values, resource considerations and cost-effectiveness; health equity; acceptability, and feasibility consideration of different treatment options. The goal of the guideline is to facilitate standard approaches to pharmacological treatment and management of hypertension which, if widely implemented, will increase the hypertension control rate world-wide.

### Treatment blood pressure targets for hypertension [^115tJF58]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

When treating elevated blood pressure, doctors need to know what blood pressure (BP) target they should try to achieve. The standard of clinical practice for some time has been ≤ 140–160/ 90–100 mmHg. New guidelines are recommending BP targets lower than this standard. It is not known whether attempting to achieve targets lower than the standard reduces mortality and morbidity.

Objectives

To determine if lower BP targets (≤ 135/85 mmHg) are associated with reduction in mortality and morbidity as compared with standard BP targets (≤ 140–160/ 90–100 mmHg).

Search Strategy

Electronic search of MEDLINE (1966–2008), EMBASE (1980–2008), and CENTRAL (up to June 2008); references from review articles, clinical guidelines, and clinical trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials comparing patients randomized to lower or to standard BP targets and providing data on any of the primary outcomes below.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers (JAA, MIP) independently assessed the included trials and data entry. Primary outcomes were total mortality; total serious adverse events; total cardiovascular events; myocardial infarction, stroke, congestive heart failure and end stage renal disease. Secondary outcomes were achieved mean systolic and diastolic BP and withdrawals due to adverse effects.

Main Results

No trials comparing different systolic BP targets were found. Seven trials (22,089 subjects) comparing different diastolic BP targets were included. Despite a -4/-3 mmHg greater achieved reduction in systolic/diastolic BP, p < 0.001, attempting to achieve "lower targets" instead of "standard targets" did not change total mortality (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.86–1.15), myocardial infarction (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.74–1.09), stroke (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.79–1.25), congestive heart failure (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.59–1.32), major cardiovascular events (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.83–1.07), or end-stage renal disease (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.81–1.27). The net health effect of lower targets cannot be fully assessed due to lack of information regarding all total serious adverse events and withdrawals due to adverse effects in 6 of 7 trials. A sensitivity analysis in diabetic patients and in patients with chronic renal disease also did not show a reduction in any of the mortality and morbidity outcomes with lower targets as compared to standard targets.

Authors' Conclusions

Treating patients to lower than standard BP targets, ≤ 140–160/90–100 mmHg, does not reduce mortality or morbidity. Because guidelines are recommending even lower targets for diabetes mellitus and chronic renal disease, we are currently conducting systematic reviews in those groups of patients.

### Pharmacotherapy for hypertension in adults 60 years or older [^115sVpty]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

This is the second substantive update of this review. It was originally published in 1998 and was previously updated in 2009. Elevated blood pressure (known as 'hypertension') increases with age - most rapidly over age 60. Systolic hypertension is more strongly associated with cardiovascular disease than is diastolic hypertension, and it occurs more commonly in older people. It is important to know the benefits and harms of antihypertensive treatment for hypertension in this age group, as well as separately for people 60 to 79 years old and people 80 years or older.

Objectives

Primary objective• To quantify the effects of antihypertensive drug treatment as compared with placebo or no treatment on all-cause mortality in people 60 years and older with mild to moderate systolic or diastolic hypertensionSecondary objectives• To quantify the effects of antihypertensive drug treatment as compared with placebo or no treatment on cardiovascular-specific morbidity and mortality in people 60 years and older with mild to moderate systolic or diastolic hypertension• To quantify the rate of withdrawal due to adverse effects of antihypertensive drug treatment as compared with placebo or no treatment in people 60 years and older with mild to moderate systolic or diastolic hypertension SEARCH METHODS: The Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomised controlled trials up to 24 November 2017: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE Ovid (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov. We contacted authors of relevant papers regarding further published and unpublished work.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of at least one year's duration comparing antihypertensive drug therapy versus placebo or no treatment and providing morbidity and mortality data for adult patients (≥ 60 years old) with hypertension defined as blood pressure greater than 140/90 mmHg.

Data Collection and Analysis

Outcomes assessed were all-cause mortality; cardiovascular morbidity and mortality; cerebrovascular morbidity and mortality; coronary heart disease morbidity and mortality; and withdrawal due to adverse effects. We modified the definition of cardiovascular mortality and morbidity to exclude transient ischaemic attacks when possible.

Main Results

This update includes one additional trial (MRC-TMH 1985). Sixteen trials (N = 26,795) in healthy ambulatory adults 60 years or older (mean age 73.4 years) from western industrialised countries with moderate to severe systolic and/or diastolic hypertension (average 182/95 mmHg) met the inclusion criteria. Most of these trials evaluated first-line thiazide diuretic therapy for a mean treatment duration of 3.8 years. Antihypertensive drug treatment reduced all-cause mortality (high-certainty evidence; 11% with control vs 10.0% with treatment; risk ratio (RR) 0.91, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.85 to 0.97; cardiovascular morbidity and mortality (moderate-certainty evidence; 13.6% with control vs 9.8% with treatment; RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.77; cerebrovascular mortality and morbidity (moderate-certainty evidence; 5.2% with control vs 3.4% with treatment; RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.74; and coronary heart disease mortality and morbidity (moderate-certainty evidence; 4.8% with control vs 3.7% with treatment; RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.88. Withdrawals due to adverse effects were increased with treatment (low-certainty evidence; 5.4% with control vs 15.7% with treatment; RR 2.91, 95% CI 2.56 to 3.30. In the three trials restricted to persons with isolated systolic hypertension, reported benefits were similar. This comprehensive systematic review provides additional evidence that the reduction in mortality observed was due mostly to reduction in the 60- to 79-year-old patient subgroup (high-certainty evidence; RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.79 to 0.95). Although cardiovascular mortality and morbidity was significantly reduced in both subgroups 60 to 79 years old (moderate-certainty evidence; RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.77) and 80 years or older (moderate-certainty evidence; RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.87), the magnitude of absolute risk reduction was probably higher among 60- to 79-year-old patients (3.8% vs 2.9%). The reduction in cardiovascular mortality and morbidity was primarily due to a reduction in cerebrovascular mortality and morbidity.

Authors' Conclusions

Treating healthy adults 60 years or older with moderate to severe systolic and/or diastolic hypertension with antihypertensive drug therapy reduced all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality and morbidity, cerebrovascular mortality and morbidity, and coronary heart disease mortality and morbidity. Most evidence of benefit pertains to a primary prevention population using a thiazide as first-line treatment.

### Evaluation of optimal diastolic blood pressure range among adults with treated systolic blood pressure less than 130 mm Hg [^11521VcP]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

What are the safe and optimal diastolic blood pressure (DBP) ranges among adults with treated systolic blood pressure (SBP) of less than 130 mm Hg?

Findings

In this cohort study of 7515 patients from 2 randomized clinical trials who had treated SBP of less than 130 mm Hg, a DBP of less than 60 mm Hg was associated with increased cardiovascular risk and a DBP between 70 and 80 mm Hg was associated with lower cardiovascular risk.

Meaning

The findings suggest that a DBP of less than 60 mm Hg may be harmful and a DBP between 70 and 80 mm Hg is an optimal target for patients with treated SBP of less than 130 mm Hg; this topic merits further study.

### Sustained-release isosorbide mononitrate as adjuvant treatment in isolated systolic hypertension in the elderly [^114MGtt5]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

Hypertension is one of the main cardiovascular risk factors. In the elderly, the most common form is isolated systolic hypertension, a consequence of the increase in arterial stiffness. None of the antihypertensives currently used affects arterial stiffness, whereas nitrates seem to have an effect. The aim of this work was to assess their effect on elderly patients with uncontrolled isolated systolic hypertension, defined as systolic blood pressure over 140mmHg and diastolic blood pressure under 90mmHg. The present study is a phase III, randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, conducted at the University Hospital La Princesa in Madrid. Patients of both sexes, aged 65 years or older, with poorly controlled isolated systolic hypertension, were treated with 40–60mg of sustained-release isosorbide mononitrate or matching placebo for 12 weeks. The main objective was to assess the effect on clinical pulse pressure (PP); in addition, its effect on vascular function was evaluated. Analysis was performed by intention to treat. The study was registered at the European Union Clinical Trials Register (EUDRACT 2012–002988–10) and was funded by the Spanish Ministry of Health. A total of 58 patients with an average age of 77 years were enrolled, 32 were treated with nitrate, and 26 with placebo. No significant differences were found either in PP decline (5.28 vs 7.49mmHg, p = 0.79) or in other variables, including parameters of vascular function. There were no differences in adverse events. The results of this study have not confirmed the benefit of nitrate treatment in isolated systolic hypertension or the improvement of vascular function.

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Younger adults and diastolic hypertension — research priorities: Observational data show increased CVD risk among younger adults with stage 1 hypertension and associations of elevated BP with evidence of target organ damage, but clarification is needed on where clinical trial evidence is sufficient to base treatment decisions for younger adults and where additional research is greatest. There is a lack of evidence to support BP targets for diastolic hypertension, which is more common in younger adults, and research should include detection of CVD endpoints outside academic centers via pragmatic designs, use of surrogate endpoints such as left ventricular hypertrophy, and evaluations for target organ damage at baseline and during longitudinal follow-up.

Blood pressure intensity and diastolic hypertension — heart failure risk and targets are outlined as follows. Intensive systolic blood pressure (SBP) lowering in SPRINT, which "targeted an SBP < 120 mm Hg", "significantly reduced the incidence of HF… (HR: 0.62; 95% CI: 0.45–0.84)", yet "the SBP target recommended (< 130 mm Hg) is higher than that used in SPRINT". For diastolic hypertension, "In adults with diastolic hypertension (DBP ≥ 80 mm Hg) and a high risk of CVD, a strong body of evidence supports treatment with antihypertensive medications", and meta-analyses "have identified a similar beneficial effect of DBP reduction on the incidence of HF".

Treatment of hypertension — Meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials indicate that a 10 mmHg reduction in systolic blood pressure (SBP) or a 5 mmHg reduction in diastolic blood pressure (DBP) is associated with reductions in all major cardiovascular (CV) events by ~20%, all-cause mortality by ~10–15%, stroke by ~35%, coronary events by ~20%, and heart failure by ~40%, and these relative risk reductions are consistent irrespective of baseline BP within the hypertensive range, the level of CV risk, comorbidities, age, sex, and ethnicity.

Results

Study selection and characteristics

A total of 15 023‬ unique articles were identified from the literature searches, of which 119 records were screened from reference lists of included articles and previous meta-analyses. After screening of the title, abstract, and full text, 63 articles originating from 58 randomised controlled trialswere eligible for inclusion (fig 1). The most common reason for exclusion at full text screening was lack of adverse event reporting (n = 108) or inclusion of too few patient years of follow-up (n = 104).

Fig 1
Selection of studies for inclusion in review. *Hand searches of reference lists of included studies and recent meta-analyses of blood pressure lowering trials

A total of 280 638 participants were included in the primary analyses from 58 unique randomised controlled trials. Forty eight studies compared a single drug treatment with placebo and 10 studies compared a high blood pressure target with a lower blood pressure target in the intervention and control groups (table 1). The remaining five studies either compared treatment with no treatment or compared multiple drugs with a single drug. The median duration of follow-up in the trials was 3 (interquartile range 2–4) years. Most studies were conducted in patients with at least one risk factor for cardiovascular disease in addition to hypertension.

### Management of stage 1 hypertension in adults with a low 10-year risk for cardiovascular disease: filling a guidance gap: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^114jixjA]. Hypertension (2021). Medium credibility.

High blood pressure (BP) is the leading cause of worldwide cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality. Patients and clinicians dealing with hypertension have benefited from the evidence of event-based randomized controlled clinical trials. One result from those trials has been the development of evidence-based guidelines. The commitment to using evidence from these event-based randomized trials has been a cornerstone in the development of guideline treatment recommendations. However, in some situations, evidence from event-based trials is not available to guideline writers or clinicians for assistance in treatment decision making. Such is the case for the management of many patients with stage 1 hypertension. The purpose of this scientific statement is to provide information complementary to the 2017 Hypertension Clinical Practice Guidelines for the patient with untreated stage 1 hypertension (systolic BP/diastolic BP, 130–139/80–89 mmHg) with a 10-year risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease < 10% who fails to meet the systolic BP/diastolic goal (< 130/80 mmHg) after 6 months of guideline-recommended lifestyle therapy. This statement provides evidence from sources other than event-based randomized controlled clinical trials and offers therapy options for consideration by clinicians.

### Triple antihypertensive medication prediction score after intracerebral hemorrhage (the TRICH score) [^116sprVC]. Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Our study has several limitations. First, the TRICH score was developed and validated in a population predominantly consisting of Han Chinese patients. The generalizability of the score to other populations is a significant limitation, and further studies are necessary. Second, approximately 30% of enrolled patients were excluded because of missing 3 months of follow-up BP. These patients were younger and had a lower rate of controlled hypertension before ICH, both of which are known factors associated with therapeutic noncompliance. However, the median TRICH score for those excluded was not significantly different from that of included patients. Hence, the TRICH score should be applicable to most patients who adhere to treatment and follow-up. Next, we could not determine medication compliance among study participants because it was not routinely recorded during follow-ups. Fourth, patients were not followed up under a standardized protocol, and antihypertensive medications were prescribed at the treating clinician's discretion. However, all patients were treated under a single health care system where the clinical practice was mostly consistent among clinicians. Furthermore, we defined the need for ≥ 3 antihypertensive medications based on the number of prescribed drugs without accounting for the dosage. Nevertheless, the median antihypertensive medication TIS of those prescribed 3 drugs was 1.6, indicating that most patients are prescribed at least 2 drugs at near-maximally tolerated doses. Because the lowest TIS of triple pills is 1.25, the TRICH score could select patients for upfront prescription of triple pill or triple antihypertensive regime, beginning at lower doses, which would also help minimize side effects. In addition, the TRICH score, which is meant to predict antihypertensive medication requirements 3 months after ICH, may not account for changes in BP control and medication needs beyond 3 months. Hence, further medication titration, including down-titration, may be necessary after this initial period. Nevertheless, the TRICH score can help clinicians ensure timely BP control after ICH through early and appropriate medication prescriptions, which is crucial in reducing early recurrent ICH and stroke risk. Finally, the definition of controlled hypertension and the TRICH score derived in this study were based solely on SBP. This limitation may affect the application of the TRICH score in ICH survivors because patients may still have isolated diastolic hypertension despite treatment. Isolated diastolic hypertension is particularly important in younger patients because it is more prevalent and associated with increased cardiovascular risk in this age group. However, it is often overlooked, and the significance of isolated diastolic hypertension among ICH survivors is also not well studied.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Prevention of HF in adults with hypertension — epidemiology and rationale: "Incident hypertension is present in 71% of patients with HFpEF, and the presence of hypertension in people < 40 years of age is highly associated with the development of incident HF". Furthermore, "There is a dose-dependent association between BP level and HF risk, and long-term treatment of systolic and diastolic hypertension has been shown to reduce this risk". Additionally, "Meta-analyses of clinical trials support BP control, rather than a specific medication class, to prevent HF".

### Blood pressure measurement and assessment of arterial structure and function: an expert group position paper [^116NqdwP]. Journal of Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

Reduction strategies of BP, as a modifiable cardiovascular risk, are currently based on office assessment of brachial artery BP. However, antihypertensive treatment based on brachial BP values reduces cardiovascular risk but does not completely reverse the hypertension-induced risk of morbidity events. The potential effects beyond peripheral BP control may be due to specific protective properties of different antihypertensive drugs to affect central aortic pressure and arterial stiffness. Indeed, much work has focused on central pressure as a better predictor of hypertension-related end-organ damage, CV events, and CV mortality. Currently, with the simple assessment of brachial BP and without considering the effects that central pressure has on CV events, we may be treating or over-treating subjects who may not require treatment and not treating subjects who should be treated. Moreover, these findings highlight the need for the identification of specific populations that might benefit more from the central BP assessment and provide the basis for further investigations. Clinical trials with hard endpoints and designed based on central and peripheral BP assessment are now required to confirm current data and to provide evidence that treatment guidance based on measurements of central BP result in better outcomes. Consequently, this might pave the way for the consideration to enter central BP assessment in the clinical management of hypertension. Nevertheless, such clinical trials are still lacking also because they are very difficult to set up. Furthermore, intercolinearity between the different BP parameters will make their interpretation weak and subject to caution (will the clinical benefit be related to the decrease of such or such BP parameter?). Therefore, more evidence is needed before stating that basing antihypertensive treatment guidance on central pressures rather than on peripheral BP could be one of the factors to be considered for future antihypertensive strategies (Table 5).

TABLE 5
Advantages, limitations, and thresholds values of central blood pressure

Because of the inconsistency of some diagnostic and prognostic data and the absence of clear cut-off values to differentiate normal from high CBP in the wider population, the widespread use of central BP measurement in the clinical management of hypertension cannot be recommended. An interesting field of application in clinic may be isolated systolic hypertension in the young in which peripheral BP may be disproportionately elevated compared with normal central BP (Table 5).

On the other hand, in research, the use of central pressure and other parameters such as augmentation index, and wave reflections indices, derived from pulse wave analysis helps to improve our understanding of the pathophysiology of many diseases, as well as some of their treatments. Therefore, for the present time, measurement of CBP is essentially reserved for clinical research and specialized centers.

### First-line drugs for hypertension [^1174mEMA]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Sustained elevated blood pressure, unresponsive to lifestyle measures, leads to a critically important clinical question: What class of drug to use first-line? This review answers that question.

Primary Objective

To quantify the benefits and harms of the major first-line anti-hypertensive drug classes: thiazides, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, alpha-blockers, and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB).

Search Strategy

Electronic search of MEDLINE (Jan. 1966-June 2008), EMBASE, CINAHL, the Cochrane clinical trial register, using standard search strategy of the hypertension review group with additional terms.

Selection Criteria

Randomized trials of at least one year duration comparing one of 6 major drug classes with a placebo or no treatment. More than 70% of people must have BP > 140/90 mmHg at baseline.

Data Collection and Analysis

The outcomes assessed were mortality, stroke, coronary heart disease (CHD), cardiovascular events (CVS), decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and withdrawals due to adverse drug effects. Risk ratio (RR) and a fixed effects model were used to combine outcomes across trials.

Main Results

Of 57 trials identified, 24 trials with 28 arms, including 58,040 patients met the inclusion criteria. Thiazides (19 RCTs) reduced mortality (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.83, 0.96), stroke (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.57, 0.71), CHD (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.75, 0.95) and CVS (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.66, 0.76). Low-dose thiazides (8 RCTs) reduced CHD (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.61, 0.84), but high-dose thiazides (11 RCTs) did not (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.85, 1.20). Beta-blockers (5 RCTs) reduced stroke (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.72, 0.97) and CVS (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.81, 0.98) but not CHD (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.78, 1.03) or mortality (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.86, 1.07). ACE inhibitors (3 RCTs) reduced mortality (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.72–0.95), stroke (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.52–0.82), CHD (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.70–0.94) and CVS (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.67–0.85). Calcium-channel blocker (1 RCT) reduced stroke (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.41, 0.84) and CVS (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.57, 0.87) but not CHD (RR 0.77 95% CI 0.55, 1.09) or mortality (RR 0.86 95% CI 0.68, 1.09). No RCTs were found for ARBs or alpha-blockers.

Authors' Conclusions

First-line low-dose thiazides reduce all morbidity and mortality outcomes. First-line ACE inhibitors and calcium channel blockers may be similarly effective but the evidence is less robust. First-line high-dose thiazides and first-line beta-blockers are inferior to first-line low-dose thiazides.

### Blood pressure targets for the treatment of people with hypertension and cardiovascular disease [^115xdVCE]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

This is the third update of the review first published in 2017. Hypertension is a prominent preventable cause of premature morbidity and mortality. People with hypertension and established cardiovascular disease are at particularly high risk, so reducing blood pressure to below standard targets may be beneficial. This strategy could reduce cardiovascular mortality and morbidity but could also increase adverse events. The optimal blood pressure target in people with hypertension and established cardiovascular disease remains unknown.

Objectives

To determine if lower blood pressure targets (systolic/diastolic 135/85 mmHg or less) are associated with reduction in mortality and morbidity compared with standard blood pressure targets (140 mmHg to 160mmHg/90 mmHg to 100 mmHg or less) in the treatment of people with hypertension and a history of cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction, angina, stroke, peripheral vascular occlusive disease).

Search Methods

For this updated review, we used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search date was January 2022. We applied no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with more than 50 participants per group that provided at least six months' follow-up. Trial reports had to present data for at least one primary outcome (total mortality, serious adverse events, total cardiovascular events, cardiovascular mortality). Eligible interventions involved lower targets for systolic/diastolic blood pressure (135/85 mmHg or less) compared with standard targets for blood pressure (140 mmHg to 160 mmHg/90 mmHg to 100 mmHg or less). Participants were adults with documented hypertension and adults receiving treatment for hypertension with a cardiovascular history for myocardial infarction, stroke, chronic peripheral vascular occlusive disease, or angina pectoris.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence.

Main Results

We included seven RCTs that involved 9595 participants. Mean follow-up was 3.7 years (range 1.0 to 4.7 years). Six of seven RCTs provided individual participant data. None of the included studies was blinded to participants or clinicians because of the need to titrate antihypertensive drugs to reach a specific blood pressure goal. However, an independent committee blinded to group allocation assessed clinical events in all trials. Hence, we assessed all trials at high risk of performance bias and low risk of detection bias. We also considered other issues, such as early termination of studies and subgroups of participants not predefined, to downgrade the certainty of the evidence. We found there is probably little to no difference in total mortality (risk ratio (RR) 1.05, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.91 to 1.23; 7 studies, 9595 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) or cardiovascular mortality (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.29; 6 studies, 9484 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Similarly, we found there may be little to no differences in serious adverse events (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.08; 7 studies, 9595 participants; low-certainty evidence) or total cardiovascular events (including myocardial infarction, stroke, sudden death, hospitalization, or death from congestive heart failure (CHF)) (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.00; 7 studies, 9595 participants; low-certainty evidence). The evidence was very uncertain about withdrawals due to adverse effects. However, studies suggest more participants may withdraw due to adverse effects in the lower target group (RR 8.16, 95% CI 2.06 to 32.28; 3 studies, 801 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Systolic and diastolic blood pressure readings were lower in the lower target group (systolic: mean difference (MD) -8.77 mmHg, 95% CI -12.82 to -4.73; 7 studies, 8657 participants; diastolic: MD -4.50 mmHg, 95% CI -6.35 to -2.65; 6 studies, 8546 participants). More drugs were needed in the lower target group (MD 0.56, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.96; 5 studies, 7910 participants), but blood pressure targets at one year were achieved more frequently in the standard target group (RR 1.20, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.23; 7 studies, 8699 participants).

Authors' Conclusions

We found there is probably little to no difference in total mortality and cardiovascular mortality between people with hypertension and cardiovascular disease treated to a lower compared to a standard blood pressure target. There may also be little to no difference in serious adverse events or total cardiovascular events. This suggests that no net health benefit is derived from a lower systolic blood pressure target. We found very limited evidence on withdrawals due to adverse effects, which led to high uncertainty. At present, evidence is insufficient to justify lower blood pressure targets (135/85 mmHg or less) in people with hypertension and established cardiovascular disease. Several trials are still ongoing, which may provide an important input to this topic in the near future.

### Isolated diastolic hypertension is not associated with endothelial dysfunction [^1149QDEq]. Hypertension Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Hypertension is associated with an impairment of endothelial function. However, it is unclear whether isolated diastolic hypertension is associated with endothelial dysfunction. The purpose of this study was to investigate the association of endothelial function with isolated diastolic hypertension diagnosed by using two major hypertension guidelines: systolic blood pressure (BP) < 130mmHg and diastolic BP ≥ 80mmHg according to the 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) hypertension guideline and systolic BP < 140mmHg and diastolic BP ≥ 90mmHg according to the 2018 European Society of Cardiology/European Society of Hypertension (ESC/ESH) hypertension guideline. We measured the flow-mediated vasodilation (FMD) of the brachial artery in subjects without systolic hypertension who were not treated with antihypertensive drugs. Of 3727 subjects (2813 men; mean age: 41.3 ± 10.9 years), 749 (20.1%) had isolated diastolic hypertension according to the 2017 ACC/AHA definition. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that isolated diastolic hypertension was not associated with endothelial dysfunction, defined as FMD < 7.0% (OR, 1.15; 95% CI, 0.98–1.35; P = 0.09). Of 4747 subjects (3727 men; mean age: 45.1 ± 10.8 years), 314 subjects (6.6%) had isolated diastolic hypertension according to the ESC/ESH definition. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that isolated diastolic hypertension was not associated with endothelial dysfunction after adjusting for age and sex (OR, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.82–1.32; P = 0.76). Isolated diastolic hypertension was not associated with endothelial dysfunction in individuals who were not treated with antihypertensive drugs regardless of the major hypertension guideline definition used.

### Hypertension: empirical evidence and implications in 2014 [^115c9dUv]. Open Heart (2014). Low credibility.

A newer study by Almgren et al that compared treated hypertensives and normotensives concluded

In spite of a substantial reduction of their blood pressure, treated hypertensive middle-aged men had a highly increased risk of stroke, MI and mortality from coronary heart disease compared with nonhypertensive men of similar age. The increased risk of cardiovascular complications escalated during the latter course of the study.

A meta-analysis by the Cochrane foundation identified (going all the way back to 1953) only 11 published randomised control trials comparing the effects of treatmentof those who were mildly hypertensive (those with BP between 140–160 and 90–100). From these 11 studies, 4 passed the criteria and were included in the meta-analysis. Consequently, after the treatment of 7080 participants for 4–5 years with antihypertensive drugs as compared to placebo, it was concluded that treatment did not reduce CHD, stroke or total CV events. In addition, it found that withdrawals due to adverse effects by drug therapy reached 9%. Finally, a study investigating the long-term effects of a randomised, placebo-controlled, clinical trial (Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly Program, SHEP)of patients aged 60 years or older with isolated systolic hypertension, with SBP of more than 160 mm Hg, found moderate gains of 105 days for all-cause mortality and 158 days for CV death. In addition, the active treatment group had higher survival free from CV death versus the placebo group but similar survival for all-cause mortality.

### 2014 evidence-based guideline for the management of high blood pressure in adults: report from the panel members appointed to the eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8) [^115CjvEw]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

Hypertension is the most common condition seen in primary care and leads to myocardial infarction, stroke, renal failure, and death if not detected early and treated appropriately. Patients want to be assured that blood pressure (BP) treatment will reduce their disease burden, while clinicians want guidance on hypertension management using the best scientific evidence. This report takes a rigorous, evidence-based approach to recommend treatment thresholds, goals, and medications in the management of hypertension in adults. Evidence was drawn from randomized controlled trials, which represent the gold standard for determining efficacy and effectiveness. Evidence quality and recommendations were graded based on their effect on important outcomes. There is strong evidence to support treating hypertensive persons aged 60 years or older to a BP goal of less than 150/90 mm Hg and hypertensive persons 30 through 59 years of age to a diastolic goal of less than 90 mm Hg; however, there is insufficient evidence in hypertensive persons younger than 60 years for a systolic goal, or in those younger than 30 years for a diastolic goal, so the panel recommends a BP of less than 140/90 mm Hg for those groups based on expert opinion. The same thresholds and goals are recommended for hypertensive adults with diabetes or nondiabetic chronic kidney disease (CKD) as for the general hypertensive population younger than 60 years. There is moderate evidence to support initiating drug treatment with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, angiotensin receptor blocker, calcium channel blocker, or thiazide-type diuretic in the nonblack hypertensive population, including those with diabetes. In the black hypertensive population, including those with diabetes, a calcium channel blocker or thiazide-type diuretic is recommended as initial therapy. There is moderate evidence to support initial or add-on antihypertensive therapy with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker in persons with CKD to improve kidney outcomes. Although this guideline provides evidence-based recommendations for the management of high BP and should meet the clinical needs of most patients, these recommendations are not a substitute for clinical judgment, and decisions about care must carefully consider and incorporate the clinical characteristics and circumstances of each individual patient.

### Searching for optimal blood pressure targets in type 2 diabetic patients with coronary artery disease [^1112T3Bz]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2019). Medium credibility.

Not so infrequently, elderly patients with T2DM with or without coronary artery disease may experience a high systolic BP in the presence of a low diastolic BP, reflecting increased aortic stiffness. In this circumstance, the lowering of systolic BP (< 140 mmHg) is clearly beneficial even at the price of further lowering diastolic BP. However, for patients with coronary artery disease and diastolic BP below 60 mmHg, caution is advised during treatment. Alternative medications for angina (e.g. ivabradine or isosorbide) and revascularization or other non-pharmacological interventions may be more beneficial as opposed to further titration of anti-hypertensive medications.

Anti-hypertensive medications

Several classes of anti-hypertensive agents have been used in the treatment of patients with T2DM and coronary artery disease.

RAAS inhibitors

ACEI/ARB are the first-line anti-hypertensive drugs in type 2 diabetic patients with coronary artery disease because they have at least similar or even greater cardiovascular protection and more effectively reduce risk of mortality, myocardial infarction, heart failure and stroke than other anti-hypertensive agents, particularly for high-risk patients. In addition, available literature demonstrates that blockade of the RAAS also has potential benefits beyond BP lowering effects, including renal protection, improvements in insulin resistance, inflammation, oxidative stress, and endothelial function and decrease in activation of matrix metalloproteinases, along with amelioration of vascular function and ventricular remodeling. However, combined use of both ACEI and ARB does not yield additional benefits and is, in fact, not recommended. Aldosterone antagonists such as spironolactone or eplerenone may be considered in type 2 diabetic patients with resistant hypertension as long as careful monitoring of renal function and serum potassium is made.

Calcium channel blockers

Calcium antagonists are commonly used for treating hypertension in type 2 diabetic patients with or without coronary artery disease, particularly in the elderly with isolated systolic hypertension. In type 2 diabetic patients who require more than one drug for BP control, a combination of an ACEI or ARB and a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker (such as amlodipine) is appropriate. Calcium channel blockers were superior to thiazide diuretics in reducing cardiovascular events, with no disadvantages of worsening lipid and glucose uptake.

### Blood pressure targets for the treatment of people with hypertension and cardiovascular disease [^113QhbJd]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

This is the second update of the review first published in 2017. Hypertension is a prominent preventable cause of premature morbidity and mortality. People with hypertension and established cardiovascular disease are at particularly high risk, so reducing blood pressure to below standard targets may be beneficial. This strategy could reduce cardiovascular mortality and morbidity but could also increase adverse events. The optimal blood pressure target in people with hypertension and established cardiovascular disease remains unknown.

Objectives

To determine if lower blood pressure targets (135/85 mmHg or less) are associated with reduction in mortality and morbidity as compared with standard blood pressure targets (140 to 160/90 to 100 mmHg or less) in the treatment of people with hypertension and a history of cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction, angina, stroke, peripheral vascular occlusive disease).

Search Methods

For this updated review, the Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) up to November 2019: Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), and Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS) (from 1982), along with the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov. We also contacted authors of relevant papers regarding further published and unpublished work. We applied no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We included RCTs with more than 50 participants per group that provided at least six months' follow-up. Trial reports had to present data for at least one primary outcome (total mortality, serious adverse events, total cardiovascular events, cardiovascular mortality). Eligible interventions involved lower targets for systolic/diastolic blood pressure (135/85 mmHg or less) compared with standard targets for blood pressure (140 to 160/90 to 100 mmHg or less). Participants were adults with documented hypertension and adults receiving treatment for hypertension with a cardiovascular history for myocardial infarction, stroke, chronic peripheral vascular occlusive disease, or angina pectoris.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed search results and extracted data using standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence.

Main Results

We included six RCTs that involved 9484 participants. Mean follow-up was 3.7 years (range 1.0 to 4.7 years). All RCTs provided individual participant data. None of the included studies was blinded to participants or clinicians because of the need to titrate antihypertensives to reach a specific blood pressure goal. However, an independent committee blinded to group allocation assessed clinical events in all trials. Hence, we assessed all trials at high risk of performance bias and low risk of detection bias. Other issues such as early termination of studies and subgroups of participants not predefined were also considered to downgrade the quality evidence. We found there is probably little to no difference in total mortality (risk ratio (RR) 1.06, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.91 to 1.23; 6 studies, 9484 participants; moderate-quality evidence) or cardiovascular mortality (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.29; 6 studies, 9484 participants; moderate-quality evidence). Similarly, we found there may be little to no differences in serious adverse events (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.08; 6 studies, 9484 participants; low-quality evidence) or total cardiovascular events (including myocardial infarction, stroke, sudden death, hospitalization, or death from congestive heart failure) (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.00; 6 studies, 9484 participants; low-quality evidence). The evidence was very uncertain about withdrawals due to adverse effects. However, studies suggest more participants may withdraw due to adverse effects in the lower target group (RR 8.16, 95% CI 2.06 to 32.28; 2 studies, 690 participants; very low-quality evidence). Systolic and diastolic blood pressure readings were lower in the lower target group (systolic: mean difference (MD) -8.90 mmHg, 95% CI -13.24 to -4.56; 6 studies, 8546 participants; diastolic: MD -4.50 mmHg, 95% CI -6.35 to -2.65; 6 studies, 8546 participants). More drugs were needed in the lower target group (MD 0.56, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.96; 5 studies, 7910 participants), but blood pressure targets were achieved more frequently in the standard target group (RR 1.21, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.24; 6 studies, 8588 participants).

Authors' Conclusions

We found there is probably little to no difference in total mortality and cardiovascular mortality between people with hypertension and cardiovascular disease treated to a lower compared to a standard blood pressure target. There may also be little to no difference in serious adverse events or total cardiovascular events. This suggests that no net health benefit is derived from a lower systolic blood pressure target. We found very limited evidence on withdrawals due to adverse effects, which led to high uncertainty. At present, evidence is insufficient to justify lower blood pressure targets (135/85 mmHg or less) in people with hypertension and established cardiovascular disease. Several trials are still ongoing, which may provide an important input to this topic in the near future.

### Chronic kidney disease risk of isolated systolic or diastolic hypertension in young adults: a nationwide sample based-cohort study [^114qJBty]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Isolated SBP or DBP and the Risk of CKD

With normal BP as the reference, the multivariable‐adjusted hazard ratios (95% CIs) for CKD as the outcome were 1.14 for elevated BP, 1.19 for stage 1 IDH, 1.24 for stage 1 ISH, 1.39 for stage 1 SDH, 1.88 for stage 2 IDH, 1.84 for stage 2 ISH, and 2.70 for stage 2 SDH groups (Table 3). We also evaluated the effect of antihypertensive medications on the CKD event. Antihypertensive medications within 1 year of medical checkup reduced the CKD risk in all groups significantly (Table 3). In order to excluding the effect of baseline proteinuria between BP and CKD risk, the analysis was performed only in patients without baseline proteinuria. The result were similar to those with baseline proteinuria (Table S1).

BP and the Risk of CKD

We also analyzed the risk of developing CKD according to the SBP or DBP level. The risk of CKD increased with an increase in the SBP or DBP level. Patients taking antihypertensive medication within 1 year of medical checkup showed a lower risk of CKD than those not taking antihypertensive medication (Table 4, Figure 2).

Pulse Pressure and the Risk of CKD

Highest pulse pressure (Q5, pulse pressure quintile‐highest) increased the risk of developing CKD. The risk of CKD was attenuated by antihypertensive medication use within 1 year of medical checkup in pulse pressure quintile (Table 5, Figure 2).

### Blood pressure targets for the treatment of people with hypertension and cardiovascular disease [^1135WgQD]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Hypertension is a prominent preventable cause of premature morbidity and mortality. People with hypertension and established cardiovascular disease are at particularly high risk, so reducing blood pressure below standard targets may be beneficial. This strategy could reduce cardiovascular mortality and morbidity but could also increase adverse events. The optimal blood pressure target in people with hypertension and established cardiovascular disease remains unknown.

Objectives

To determine if 'lower' blood pressure targets (≤ 135/85 mmHg) are associated with reduction in mortality and morbidity as compared with 'standard' blood pressure targets (≤ 140 to 160/ 90 to 100 mmHg) in the treatment of people with hypertension and a history of cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction, angina, stroke, peripheral vascular occlusive disease).

Search Methods

The Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomized controlled trials up to February 2017: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov. We also searched the Latin American and Caribbean Health Science Literature Database (from 1982) and contacted authors of relevant papers regarding further published and unpublished work. There were no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with more than 50 participants per group and at least six months follow-up. Trial reports needed to present data for at least one primary outcome (total mortality, serious adverse events, total cardiovascular events, cardiovascular mortality). Eligible interventions were lower target for systolic/diastolic blood pressure (≤ 135/85 mmHg) compared with standard target for blood pressure (≤ 140 to 160/90 to 100 mmHg). Participants were adults with documented hypertension or who were receiving treatment for hypertension and cardiovascular history for myocardial infarction, stroke, chronic peripheral vascular occlusive disease or angina pectoris.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed search results and extracted data using standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration.

Main Results

We included six RCTs that involved a total of 9795 participants. Mean follow-up was 3.7 years (range 1.0 to 4.7 years). Five RCTs provided individual patient data for 6775 participants. We found no change in total mortality (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.22) or cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.21; moderate-quality evidence). Similarly, no differences were found in serious adverse events (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.11; low-quality evidence). There was a reduction in fatal and non fatal cardiovascular events (including myocardial infarction, stroke, sudden death, hospitalization or death from congestive heart failure) with the lower target (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.78 to 0.98; ARR 1.6% over 3.7 years; low-quality evidence). There were more participant withdrawals due to adverse effects in the lower target arm (RR 8.16, 95% CI 2.06 to 32.28; very low-quality evidence). Blood pressures were lower in the lower' target group by 9.5/4.9 mmHg. More drugs were needed in the lower target group but blood pressure targets were achieved more frequently in the standard target group.

Authors' Conclusions

No evidence of a difference in total mortality and serious adverse events was found between treating to a lower or to a standard blood pressure target in people with hypertension and cardiovascular disease. This suggests no net health benefit from a lower systolic blood pressure target despite the small absolute reduction in total cardiovascular serious adverse events. There was very limited evidence on adverse events, which lead to high uncertainty. At present there is insufficient evidence to justify lower blood pressure targets (≤ 135/85 mmHg) in people with hypertension and established cardiovascular disease. More trials are needed to answer this question.

### DASH (dietary approaches to stop hypertension) diet is effective treatment for stage 1 isolated systolic hypertension [^116NnVWT]. Hypertension (2001). Low credibility.

Use of the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet, which is rich in fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy foods, significantly lowers blood pressure. Among the 459 participants in the DASH Trial, 72 had stage 1 isolated systolic hypertension (ISH) (systolic blood pressure, 140 to 159 mm Hg; diastolic blood pressure, < 90 mm Hg). We examined the blood pressure response in these 72 participants to determine whether the DASH diet is an effective treatment for stage 1 ISH. After a 3-week run-in period on a typical American (control) diet, participants were randomly assigned for 8 weeks to 1 of 3 diets: a continuation of the control diet (n = 25), a diet rich in fruits and vegetables (n = 24), or the DASH diet (n = 23). Sodium content was the same in the 3 diets, and caloric intake was adjusted during the trial to prevent weight change. Blood pressure was measured at baseline and at the end of the 8-week intervention period with standard sphygmomanometry. Use of the DASH diet significantly lowered systolic blood pressure compared with the control diet (-11.2 mm Hg; 95% confidence interval, -6.1 to -16.2 mm Hg; P < 0.001) and the fruits/vegetables diet (-8.0 mm Hg; 95% confidence interval, -2.5 to -13.4 mm Hg; P < 0.01). Overall, blood pressure in the DASH group fell from 146/85 to 134/82 mm Hg. Similar results were observed with 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure measurements. In the DASH diet group, 18 of 23 participants (78%) reduced their systolic blood pressure to < 140 mm Hg, compared with 24% and 50% in the control and fruits/vegetables groups, respectively. Our results indicate that the DASH diet, which is rich in fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy foods, is effective as first-line therapy in stage 1 ISH.

### Blood pressure targets in adults with hypertension [^1148paiZ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

This is the first update of this review first published in 2009. When treating elevated blood pressure, doctors usually try to achieve a blood pressure target. That target is the blood pressure value below which the optimal clinical benefit is supposedly obtained. "The lower the better" approach that guided the treatment of elevated blood pressure for many years was challenged during the last decade due to lack of evidence from randomised trials supporting that strategy. For that reason, the standard blood pressure target in clinical practice during the last years has been less than 140/90 mm Hg for the general population of patients with elevated blood pressure. However, new trials published in recent years have reintroduced the idea of trying to achieve lower blood pressure targets. Therefore, it is important to know whether the benefits outweigh harms when attempting to achieve targets lower than the standard target.

Objectives

The primary objective was to determine if lower blood pressure targets (any target less than or equal to 135/85 mm Hg) are associated with reduction in mortality and morbidity as compared with standard blood pressure targets (less than or equal to 140/ 90 mm Hg) for the treatment of patients with chronic arterial hypertension. The secondary objectives were: to determine if there is a change in mean achieved systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP associated with "lower targets" as compared with "standard targets" in patients with chronic arterial hypertension; and to determine if there is a change in withdrawals due to adverse events with "lower targets" as compared with "standard targets", in patients with elevated blood pressure.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomised controlled trials up to May 2019: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, CENTRAL (2019, Issue 4), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov. We also contacted authors of relevant papers regarding further published and unpublished work. The searches had no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing patients allocated to lower or to standard blood pressure targets (see above).

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors (JAA, VL) independently assessed the included trials and extracted data. Primary outcomes were total mortality; total serious adverse events; myocardial infarction, stroke, congestive heart failure, end stage renal disease, and other serious adverse events. Secondary outcomes were achieved mean SBP and DBP, withdrawals due to adverse effects, and mean number of antihypertensive drugs used. We assessed the risk of bias of each trial using the Cochrane risk of bias tool and the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. MAIN RESULTS: This update includes 11 RCTs involving 38,688 participants with a mean follow-up of 3.7 years. This represents 7 new RCTs compared with the original version. At baseline the mean weighted age was 63.1 years and the mean weighted blood pressure was 155/91 mm Hg. Lower targets do not reduce total mortality (risk ratio (RR) 0.95, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.86 to 1.05; 11 trials, 38,688 participants; high-certainty evidence) and do not reduce total serious adverse events (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.08; 6 trials, 18,165 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). This means that the benefits of lower targets do not outweigh the harms as compared to standard blood pressure targets. Lower targets may reduce myocardial infarction (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.96; 6 trials, 18,938 participants, absolute risk reduction (ARR) 0.4%, number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) 250 over 3.7 years) and congestive heart failure (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.92; 5 trials, 15,859 participants, ARR 0.6%, NNTB 167 over 3.7 years) (low-certainty for both outcomes). Reduction in myocardial infarction and congestive heart failure was not reflected in total serious adverse events. This may be due to an increase in other serious adverse events (RR 1.44, 95% CI 1.32 to 1.59; 6 trials. 18,938 participants, absolute risk increase (ARI) 3%, number needed to treat to harm (NNTH) 33 over four years) (low-certainty evidence). Participants assigned to a "lower" target received one additional antihypertensive medication and achieved a significantly lower mean SBP (122.8 mm Hg versus 135.0 mm Hg, and a lower mean DBP (82.0 mm Hg versus 85.2 mm Hg, than those assigned to "standard target".

Authors' Conclusions

For the general population of persons with elevated blood pressure, the benefits of trying to achieve a lower blood pressure target rather than a standard target (≤ 140/90 mm Hg) do not outweigh the harms associated with that intervention. Further research is needed to see if some groups of patients would benefit or be harmed by lower targets. The results of this review are primarily applicable to older people with moderate to high cardiovascular risk. They may not be applicable to other populations.

### Pharmacotherapy for hypertension in adults aged 18 to 59 years [^116gxaYu]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Hypertension is an important risk factor for adverse cardiovascular events including stroke, myocardial infarction, heart failure and renal failure. The main goal of treatment is to reduce these events. Systematic reviews have shown proven benefit of antihypertensive drug therapy in reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality but most of the evidence is in people 60 years of age and older. We wanted to know what the effects of therapy are in people 18 to 59 years of age.

Objectives

To quantify antihypertensive drug effects on all-cause mortality in adults aged 18 to 59 years with mild to moderate primary hypertension. To quantify effects on cardiovascular mortality plus morbidity (including cerebrovascular and coronary heart disease mortality plus morbidity), withdrawal due adverse events and estimate magnitude of systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) lowering at one year.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomized controlled trials up to January 2017: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov. We contacted authors of relevant papers regarding further published and unpublished work.

Selection Criteria

Randomized trials of at least one year' duration comparing antihypertensive pharmacotherapy with a placebo or no treatment in adults aged 18 to 59 years with mild to moderate primary hypertension defined as SBP 140 mmHg or greater or DBP 90 mmHg or greater at baseline, or both.

Data Collection and Analysis

The outcomes assessed were all-cause mortality, total cardiovascular (CVS) mortality plus morbidity, withdrawals due to adverse events, and decrease in SBP and DBP. For dichotomous outcomes, we used risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) and a fixed-effect model to combine outcomes across trials. For continuous outcomes, we used mean difference (MD) with 95% CI and a random-effects model as there was significant heterogeneity.

Main Results

The population in the seven included studies (17,327 participants) were predominantly healthy adults with mild to moderate primary hypertension. The Medical Research Council Trial of Mild Hypertension contributed 14,541 (84%) of total randomized participants, with mean age of 50 years and mean baseline blood pressure of 160/98 mmHg and a mean duration of follow-up of five years. Treatments used in this study were bendrofluazide 10 mg daily or propranolol 80 mg to 240 mg daily with addition of methyldopa if required. The risk of bias in the studies was high or unclear for a number of domains and led us to downgrade the quality of evidence for all outcomes. Based on five studies, antihypertensive drug therapy as compared to placebo or untreated control may have little or no effect on all-cause mortality (2.4% with control vs 2.3% with treatment; low quality evidence; RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.13). Based on 4 studies, the effects on coronary heart disease were uncertain due to low quality evidence (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.19). Low quality evidence from six studies showed that drug therapy may reduce total cardiovascular mortality and morbidity from 4.1% to 3.2% over five years (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.91) due to reduction in cerebrovascular mortality and morbidity (1.3% with control vs 0.6% with treatment; RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.64). Very low quality evidence from three studies showed that withdrawals due to adverse events were higher with drug therapy from 0.7% to 3.0% (RR 4.82, 95% CI 1.67 to 13.92). The effects on blood pressure varied between the studies and we are uncertain as to how much of a difference treatment makes on average.

Authors' Conclusions

Antihypertensive drugs used to treat predominantly healthy adults aged 18 to 59 years with mild to moderate primary hypertension have a small absolute effect to reduce cardiovascular mortality and morbidity primarily due to reduction in cerebrovascular mortality and morbidity. All-cause mortality and coronary heart disease were not reduced. There is lack of good evidence on withdrawal due to adverse events. Future trials in this age group should be at least 10 years in duration and should compare different first-line drug classes and strategies.

Other supporting evidence for DBP treatment thresholds includes the Veterans Administration Cooperative Study Group on Antihypertensive Agents, in which 380 men with DBP 90 to 114 mm Hg were randomized to antihypertensive therapy or placebo. Those receiving treatment benefited from a reduction in both morbidity and mortality. 35 The same findings were seen in the MRC (Medical Research Council, N = 17 354) and HDFP (Hypertension Detection and Follow‐up, N = 10 940) trials, with those with DBP > 90 mm Hg benefiting from active treatment, especially in stroke reduction. 36, 37

### 2018 ESC / ESH guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension [^114FFvZw]. European Heart Journal (2018). Medium credibility.

ESC/ESH 2018 hypertension — blood pressure targets: In patients (≥ 65 years), SBP should be targeted to between 130 and 140 mmHg and diastolic BP (DBP) to < 80 mmHg, and treated SBP should not be targeted to < 120 mmHg. The guideline specifies a target range because the lower safety boundary assumes greater importance when BP is targeted to lower levels, and when SBP is lowered to < 120 mmHg in patients included in randomized controlled trials (older and higher-risk patients with comorbidities and cardiovascular disease), the risk of harm appears to increase and outweigh the benefits.

### Sustained reduction of blood pressure with baroreceptor activation therapy: results of the 6-year open follow-up [^111XhRch]. Hypertension (2017). Low credibility.

Baroreflex activation therapy is a novel technique for treating patients with resistant hypertension. Although short-term studies have demonstrated that it lowers blood pressure, long-term results have not yet been reported. The aim of the present study is to assess the long-term efficacy and safety of baroreflex activation therapy. Long-term follow-up data were analyzed from all patients who had been included in 1 of the 3 trials that focused on treatment-resistant hypertensive patients. Altogether, 383 patients were available for analysis: 143 of these had completed 5 years of follow-up and 48 patients had completed 6 years of follow-up. In the entire cohort, office systolic blood pressure fell from 179 ± 24 mmHg to 144 ± 28 mmHg (P < 0.0001), whereas office diastolic pressure dropped from 103 ± 16 mmHg to 85 ± 18 mmHg (P < 0.0001). Heart rate fell from 74 ± 15 beats per minute to 71 ± 13 beats per minute (P < 0.02). The effect of baroreflex activation therapy is greater than average in patients with signs of heart failure and less than average in patients with isolated systolic hypertension. In ≈25% of patients, it was possible to reduce the number of medications from a median of 6 to a median of 3. Temporary side effects, related to either the surgical procedure or the cardiovascular instability, do occur, but they do not require specific measures and resolve over time. After a follow-up of 6 years, baroreflex activation therapy maintains its efficacy for persistent reduction of office blood pressure in patients with resistant hypertension without major safety issues.

### Amlodipine besylate (Norvasc) [^111UepAZ]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

1.1 Hypertension

NORVASC®is indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes including NORVASC.

Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than one drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program's Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC).

Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly.

Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal.

Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy.

NORVASC may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents.

### Blood pressure targets for the treatment of people with hypertension and cardiovascular disease [^115RaCrb]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

This is the first update of the review published in 2017. Hypertension is a prominent preventable cause of premature morbidity and mortality. People with hypertension and established cardiovascular disease are at particularly high risk, so reducing blood pressure to below standard targets may be beneficial. This strategy could reduce cardiovascular mortality and morbidity but could also increase adverse events. The optimal blood pressure target in people with hypertension and established cardiovascular disease remains unknown.

Objectives

To determine if 'lower' blood pressure targets (≤ 135/85 mmHg) are associated with reduction in mortality and morbidity as compared with 'standard' blood pressure targets (≤ 140 to 160/90 to 100 mmHg) in the treatment of people with hypertension and a history of cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction, angina, stroke, peripheral vascular occlusive disease).

Search Methods

For this updated review, the Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomized controlled trials up to February 2018: Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), and Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS) (from 1982), along with the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov. We also contacted authors of relevant papers regarding further published and unpublished work. We applied no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that included more than 50 participants per group and provided at least six months' follow-up. Trial reports had to present data for at least one primary outcome (total mortality, serious adverse events, total cardiovascular events, cardiovascular mortality). Eligible interventions involved lower targets for systolic/diastolic blood pressure (≤ 135/85 mmHg) compared with standard targets for blood pressure (≤ 140 to 160/90 to 100 mmHg). Participants were adults with documented hypertension and adults receiving treatment for hypertension with a cardiovascular history for myocardial infarction, stroke, chronic peripheral vascular occlusive disease, or angina pectoris.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed search results and extracted data using standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.

Main Results

We included six RCTs that involved a total of 9484 participants. Mean follow-up was 3.7 years (range 1.0 to 4.7 years). All RCTs provided individual participant data. We found no change in total mortality (risk ratio (RR) 1.06, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.91 to 1.23) or cardiovascular mortality (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.29; moderate-quality evidence). Similarly, we found no differences in serious adverse events (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.08; low-quality evidence) or total cardiovascular events (including myocardial infarction, stroke, sudden death, hospitalization, or death from congestive heart failure) (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.00; low-quality evidence). Studies reported more participant withdrawals due to adverse effects in the lower target arm (RR 8.16, 95% CI 2.06 to 32.28; very low-quality evidence). Blood pressures were lower in the lower target group by 8.9/4.5 mmHg. More drugs were needed in the lower target group, but blood pressure targets were achieved more frequently in the standard target group.

Authors' Conclusions

We found no evidence of a difference in total mortality, serious adverse events, or total cardiovascular events between people with hypertension and cardiovascular disease treated to a lower or to a standard blood pressure target. This suggests that no net health benefit is derived from a lower systolic blood pressure target. We found very limited evidence on adverse events, which led to high uncertainty. At present, evidence is insufficient to justify lower blood pressure targets (≤ 135/85 mmHg) in people with hypertension and established cardiovascular disease. More trials are needed to examine this topic.

### Irbesartan [^114febe9]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

1.1 Hypertension

Irbesartan tablets are indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure lowers the risk of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular (CV) events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarction. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes including this drug.

Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than 1 drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program's Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC).

Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly.

Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal.

Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy.

Irbesartan tablets may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents.

### Telmisartan [^1138cFtR]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

1.1 Hypertension

Telmisartan tablets are indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes including the class to which this drug principally belongs.

Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than one drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program's Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC).

Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly.

### Blood pressure targets for hypertension in older adults [^113ZCV8W]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Eight out of 10 major antihypertensive trials in older adults attempted to achieve a target systolic blood pressure (BP) less than 160 mmHg. Collectively these trials demonstrated benefit for treatment, as compared to no treatment, for an older adult with BP greater than 160 mmHg. However an even lower BP target of less than 140 mmHg is commonly applied to all age groups. At the present time it is not known whether a lower or higher BP target is associated with better cardiovascular outcomes in older adults.

Objectives

To assess the effects of a higher (less than 150 to 160/95 to 105 mmHg) BP target compared to the lower BP target of less than 140/90 mmHg in hypertensive adults 65 years of age or older.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomised controlled trials up to February 2017: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, MEDLINE, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. We also contacted authors of relevant papers regarding further published and unpublished work.

Selection Criteria

Randomised trials, of at least one year's duration, conducted on hypertensive adults aged 65 years or older, which report the effect on mortality and morbidity of a higher systolic or diastolic BP treatment target (whether ambulatory, home, or office measurements) in the range of systolic BP less than 150 to 160 mmHg or diastolic BP less than 95 to 105 mmHg as compared to a lower BP treatment target of less than 140/90 mmHg or lower.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently screened and selected trials for inclusion, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data. We combined data for dichotomous outcomes using the risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) and for continuous outcomes we used mean difference (MD). Primary outcomes were all-cause mortality, stroke, institutionalisation, and cardiovascular serious adverse events. Secondary outcomes included cardiovascular mortality, non-cardiovascular mortality, unplanned hospitalisation, each component of cardiovascular serious adverse events separately (including cerebrovascular disease, cardiac disease, vascular disease, and renal failure), total serious adverse events, total minor adverse events, withdrawals due to adverse effects, systolic BP achieved, and diastolic BP achieved.

Main Results

We found and included three unblinded randomised trials in 8221 older adults (mean age 74.8 years), in which higher BP targets of less than 150/90 mmHg (two trials) and less than 160/90 mmHg (one trial) were compared to a lower target of less than 140/90 mmHg. Treatment to the two different BP targets over two to four years failed to produce a difference in any of our primary outcomes, including all-cause mortality (RR 1.24 95% CI 0.99 to 1.54), stroke (RR 1.25 95% CI 0.94 to 1.67) and total cardiovascular serious adverse events (RR 1.19 95% CI 0.98 to 1.45). However, the 95% confidence intervals of these outcomes suggest the lower BP target is probably not worse, and might offer a clinically important benefit. We judged all comparisons to be based on low-quality evidence. Data on adverse effects were not available from all trials and not different, including total serious adverse events, total minor adverse events, and withdrawals due to adverse effects.

Authors' Conclusions

At the present time there is insufficient evidence to know whether a higher BP target (less than150 to 160/95 to 105 mmHg) or a lower BP target (less than 140/90 mmHg) is better for older adults with high BP. Additional good-quality trials assessing BP targets in this population are needed.

1.1 Hypertension

PREXXARTAN is indicated for the treatment of hypertension in adults and children six years and older, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes including the class to which valsartan principally belongs. There are no controlled trials in hypertensive patients demonstrating risk reduction with valsartan.

### Classes of antihypertensive agents and mortality in hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes-network meta-analysis of randomized trials [^112sNfDi]. Journal of Diabetes and Its Complications (2016). Low credibility.

Aims

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of antihypertensive drug classes in mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes.

Methods

MEDLINE, EMBASE, Clinical Trials and Cochrane Library were searched for randomized trials comparing thiazides, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers (CCBs), angiotensin-converting inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs), alone or in combination for hypertension treatment in patients with type 2 diabetes. Outcomes were overall and cardiovascular mortality. Network meta-analysis was used to obtain pooled effect estimate.

Results

A total of 27 studies, comprising 49,418 participants, 5647 total and 1306 cardiovascular deaths were included. No differences in total or cardiovascular mortality were observed with isolated antihypertensive drug classes compared to each other or placebo. The ACEi and CCB combination showed evidence of reduction in cardiovascular mortality comparing to placebo [median HR, 95% credibility intervals: 0.16, 0.01–0.82], betablockers (0.20, 0.02–0.98), CCBs (0.21, 0.02–0.97) and ARBs (0.18, 0.02–0.91). In included trials, this combination was the treatment that most consistently achieved both lower systolic and diastolic end of study blood pressure.

Conclusions

There is no benefit of a single antihypertensive class in reduction of mortality in hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes. Reduction of cardiovascular mortality observed in patients treated with ACEi and CCB combination may be related to lower blood pressure levels.

### 2018 ESC / ESH guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension [^115QEbuE]. European Heart Journal (2018). Medium credibility.

ESC/ESH 2018 hypertension — central aortic pressure describes that various techniques allow aortic BP (central BP) to be derived from peripheral BP measurements using dedicated algorithms, and that in hypertensive patients central BP predicts cardiovascular (CV) events with a differential effect of antihypertensive drugs on central compared with brachial BP, although the incremental prognostic value of central vs. conventional clinic BP measurement remains unclear. An exception may be isolated systolic hypertension in the young, in whom peripheral BP may be disproportionately elevated relative to a normal central BP; this occurs in a small fraction of younger people, mainly men with isolated systolic hypertension, and it remains unclear whether such patients are at lower risk than suggested by their brachial office BP.

### Blood pressure targets for hypertension in people with diabetes mellitus [^1134KvG7]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

When treating elevated blood pressure (BP), doctors often want to know what blood pressure target they should try to achieve. The standard blood pressure target in clinical practice for some time has been less than 140–160/90–100 mmHg for the general population of people with elevated blood pressure. Several clinical guidelines published in recent years have recommended lower targets (less than 130/80 mmHg) for people with diabetes mellitus. It is not known whether attempting to achieve targets lower than the standard target reduces mortality and morbidity in those with elevated blood pressure and diabetes.

Objectives

To determine if 'lower' BP targets (any target less than 130/85 mmHg) are associated with reduction in mortality and morbidity compared with 'standard' BP targets (less than 140–160/90–100 mmHg) in people with diabetes.

Search Methods

We searched the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness (DARE) and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews for related reviews. We conducted electronic searches of the Hypertension Group Specialised Register (January 1946 - October 2013), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2013, Issue 9), MEDLINE (January 1946 - October 2013), EMBASE (January 1974 - October 2013) and ClinicalTrials.gov. The most recent search was performed on October 4, 2013. Other search sources were the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP), and reference lists of all papers and relevant reviews.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials comparing people with diabetes randomized to lower or to standard BP targets as previously defined, and providing data on any of the primary outcomes below.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed and established the included trials and data entry. Primary outcomes were total mortality; total serious adverse events; myocardial infarction, stroke, congestive heart failure and end-stage renal disease. Secondary outcomes were achieved mean systolic and diastolic BP, and withdrawals due to adverse effects.

Main Results

We found five randomized trials, recruiting a total of 7314 participants and with a mean follow-up of 4.5 years. Only one trial (ACCORD) compared outcomes associated with 'lower' (< 120 mmHg) or 'standard' (< 140 mmHg) systolic blood pressure targets in 4734 participants. Despite achieving a significantly lower BP (119.3/64.4 mmHg vs 133.5/70.5 mmHg, P < 0.0001), and using more antihypertensive medications, the only significant benefit in the group assigned to 'lower' systolic blood pressure (SBP) was a reduction in the incidence of stroke: risk ratio (RR) 0.58, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.39 to 0.88, P = 0.009, absolute risk reduction 1.1%. The effect of SBP targets on mortality was compatible with both a reduction and increase in risk: RR 1.05 CI 0.84 to 1.30, low quality evidence. Trying to achieve the 'lower' SBP target was associated with a significant increase in the number of other serious adverse events: RR 2.58, 95% CI 1.70 to 3.91, P < 0.00001, absolute risk increase 2.0%. Four trials (ABCD-H, ABCD-N, ABCD-2V, and a subgroup of HOT) specifically compared clinical outcomes associated with 'lower' versus 'standard' targets for diastolic blood pressure (DBP) in people with diabetes. The total number of participants included in the DBP target analysis was 2580. Participants assigned to 'lower' DBP had a significantly lower achieved BP: 128/76 mmHg vs 135/83 mmHg, P < 0.0001. There was a trend towards reduction in total mortality in the group assigned to the 'lower' DBP target (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.01), mainly due to a trend to lower non-cardiovascular mortality. There was no difference in stroke (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.05), in myocardial infarction (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.40) or in congestive heart failure (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.92), low quality evidence. End-stage renal failure and total serious adverse events were not reported in any of the trials. A sensitivity analysis of trials comparing DBP targets < 80 mmHg (as suggested in clinical guidelines) versus < 90 mmHg showed similar results. There was a high risk of selection bias for every outcome analyzed in favor of the 'lower' target in the trials included for the analysis of DBP targets.

Authors' Conclusions

At the present time, evidence from randomized trials does not support blood pressure targets lower than the standard targets in people with elevated blood pressure and diabetes. More randomized controlled trials are needed, with future trials reporting total mortality, total serious adverse events as well as cardiovascular and renal events.

### Sex and gender in hypertension guidelines [^111MjVgK]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2023). Medium credibility.

Results

2021 WHO Guideline

Sex-related aspects and recommendations of previous WHO and joint WHO/ISH guidelines are presented in the Data Supplement. In 2021, the WHO released a guideline paper for the pharmacological treatment of hypertension in adults.

Sex and gender aspects

Overall, it is recommended that pharmacological treatment of hypertension, including treatment initiation and targets for BP control, should not be different between men and women.

Pregnancy-related aspects

However, it was underlined that different drug treatment algorithms, including renin–angiotensin system blockers, are contraindicated during pregnancy and also in women who could become pregnant. Hypertension in pregnancy is generally diagnosed when BP is ≥ 140 mmHg and/or ≥ 90 mmHg on at least two occasions, at least six hours apart. Chronic hypertension is defined as a diagnosis of hypertension before 20 weeks of gestation, while gestational hypertension is defined as hypertension at 20 weeks or later. Preeclampsia and eclampsia are pregnancy-specific medical conditions requiring immediate and specific medical management. It was acknowledged that while BP treatment thresholds for hypertension in pregnancy continue to change, it is generally recommended for both chronic and gestational hypertension that pharmacologic treatment be initiated when the systolic BP is ≥ 160 mmHg and/or the diastolic BP is ≥ 105 mmHg. In women diagnosed with hypertension before pregnancy, the antihypertensive treatment may be continued unaltered. However, some medications may have to be changed to preferred medications, while medications contraindicated in pregnancy must be discontinued. The guideline report acknowledged that recommended on-treatment BP target in pregnancy also has been subject to debate and is changing. For instance, achieving lower BP target (diastolic BP of 85 mmHg vs. 100 mmHg) has decreased severe hypertension rates while not increasing maternal or fetal risk. In the case of women with hypertension-mediated target organ damage, the initiation of antihypertensive treatment at a diastolic BP of ≥ 90 mmHg should be considered. Preferred medications are: methyldopa, beta blockers (particularly labetalol, but not atenolol), calcium channel blockers (particularly nifedipine and, as an alternative, verapamil), and direct-acting vasodilators (particularly hydralazine). There is evidence to suggest that among these agents, beta blockers and calcium channel blockers appear more effective than methyldopa in decreasing the development of severe hypertension later in pregnancy. Thiazide diuretics have been debated, particularly if the individual is already on a thiazide before pregnancy. In this situation, the thiazide diuretic may be continued.

1.1 Hypertension

MICARDIS is indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions.

### First-line combination therapy versus first-line monotherapy for primary hypertension [^113i4TjW]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Starting with one drug and starting with a combination of two drugs are strategies suggested in clinical guidelines as initial treatment of hypertension. The recommendations are not based on evidence about clinically relevant outcomes. Some antihypertensive combinations have been shown to be harmful. The actual harm-to-benefit balance of each strategy is unknown.

Objectives

To determine if there are differences in clinical outcomes between monotherapy and combination therapy as initial treatment for primary hypertension.

Search Methods

We searched the Hypertension Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, 2016, Issue 2), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, LILACS, ClinicalTrials.gov, Current Controlled Trials, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) up to February 2016. We searched in clinical studies repositories of pharmaceutical companies, reviews of combination drugs in Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency, and lists of references in reviews and clinical practice guidelines.

Selection Criteria

Randomized, double-blind trials with at least 12 months' follow-up in adults with primary hypertension (systolic blood pressure/diastolic blood pressure 140/90 mmHg or higher, or 130/80 mmHg or higher if participants had diabetes), which compared combination of two first-line antihypertensive drug with monotherapy as initial treatment. Trials had to include at least 50 participants per group and report mortality, cardiovascular mortality, cardiovascular events or serious adverse events.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently selected trials for inclusion, evaluated the risk of bias and entered the data. Primary outcomes were mortality, serious adverse events, cardiovascular events and cardiovascular mortality. Secondary outcomes were withdrawals due to drug-related adverse effects, reaching blood pressure control (as defined in each trial) and blood pressure change from baseline. Analyses were based on the intention-to-treat principle. We summarized data on dichotomous outcomes as risk ratios with 95% confidence intervals.

Main Results

We found three studies in which a subgroup of participants met our inclusion criteria. None of the studies focused solely on people initiating antihypertensive treatment so we asked investigators for data for this subgroup (monotherapy: 335 participants; combination therapy: 233 participants). They included outpatients, and mostly European and white people. Two trials included only people with type 2 diabetes, whereas the other trial excluded people treated with diabetes, hypocholesterolaemia or cardiovascular drugs. The follow-up was 12 months in two trials and 36 months in one trial. Certainty of evidence was very low due to the serious imprecision, and for using a subgroup not defined in advance. Confidence intervals were extremely wide for all important outcomes and included both appreciable harm and benefit.

Authors' Conclusions

The numbers of included participants and, hence the number of events, were too small to draw any conclusion about the relative efficacy of monotherapy versus combination therapy as initial treatment for primary hypertension. There is a need for large clinical trials that address the question and report clinically relevant endpoints.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the evaluation and management of adult patients with asymptomatic hypertension in the emergency department [^116i1LNB]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2006). Medium credibility.

Classification and management of blood pressure for adults aged 18 years or older detail categories, lifestyle modification, and initial drug therapy. Normal is defined as systolic < 120 mm Hg and diastolic < 80 mm Hg with lifestyle modification to encourage. Prehypertension is 120–139 mm Hg systolic or 80–89 mm Hg diastolic, lifestyle modification is yes, and without compelling indications no antihypertensive drug is indicated. Stage 1 hypertension is 140–159 mm Hg systolic or 90–99 mm Hg diastolic, lifestyle modification is yes, and without compelling indications initial therapy is thiazide-type diuretics for most; may consider ACE inhibitor, ARB, β-blocker, CCB, or combination. Stage 2 hypertension is ≥ 160 mm Hg systolic or ≥ 100 mm Hg diastolic, lifestyle modification is yes, and without compelling indications initial therapy is a 2-drug combination for most (usually thiazide-type diuretic and ACE inhibitor or ARB or β-blocker or CCB). With compelling indications, use drug(s) for the compelling indications, with other antihypertensive drugs (diuretics, ACE inhibitor, ARB, β-blocker, CCB) as needed. Treatment is determined by highest BP category. Treat patients with chronic kidney disease or diabetes to BP goal of less than 130/80 mm Hg. Initial combined therapy should be used cautiously in those at risk for orthostatic hypotension.

### AHA / ACC / ASH release guideline on the treatment of hypertension… [^115xwpan]. AAFP (2015). Low credibility.

This regimen should also be considered in the absence of prior MI, left ventricular systolic dysfunction, diabetes, or proteinuric chronic kidney disease. If needed, a nondihydropyridine calcium channel blocker may be substituted for the beta blocker in patients without left ventricular dysfunction. However, combining a beta blocker with a nondihydropyridine calcium channel blocker increases risk of significant bradyarrhythmias and heart failure in patients with hypertension and symptomatic CAD. If the hypertension or angina is not controlled with the initial regimen, a long-acting dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker can be added. There are no contraindications for the use of antiplatelets or anticoagulants in patients with hypertension. However, in patients with uncontrolled severe hypertension who are taking these medications, blood pressure should be lowered immediately to reduce the risk of hemorrhagic stroke.

If there are no contraindications to beta blockers, the initial therapy for hypertension in patients with ACS should be an oral short-acting beta. Beta-blocker therapy should be delayed in patients who are hemodynamically unstable or who have decompensated heart failure. A nondihydropyridine calcium channel blocker may be substituted for the beta blocker in patients with ongoing ischemia and no left ventricular dysfunction, and a long-acting dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker can be added if hypertension and angina are not controlled with initial treatment. MANAGEMENT OF HYPERTENSION IN PATIENTS WITH HEART FAILURE OF ISCHEMIC ORIGIN Patients with hypertension and heart failure should be treated with an ACE inhibitor or ARB, beta blocker, and aldosterone receptor antagonist. ACE inhibitors and the ARB candesartan or valsartan are equally effective.

In patients with hypertension and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, the goal is to control systolic and diastolic hypertension. The aldosterone receptor antagonists spironolactone and eplerenone should be added in patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction. They may be substituted for a thiazide diuretic in patients requiring a potassium-sparing agent. Serum potassium should be monitored if an aldosterone receptor antagonist is used with an ACE inhibitor or an ARB, or if the patient has renal insufficiency.

### JNC 8 guidelines for the management of hypertension in… [^113PQ4sc]. AAFP (2014). Low credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- In the general population, pharmacologic treatment should be initiated when blood pressure is 150/90 mm Hg or higher in adults 60 years and older, or 140/90 mm Hg or higher in adults younger than 60 years.
- In patients with hypertension and diabetes, pharmacologic treatment should be initiated when blood pressure is 140/90 mm Hg or higher, regardless of age.
- Initial antihypertensive treatment should include a thiazide diuretic, calcium channel blocker, ACE inhibitor, or ARB in the general nonblack population or a thiazide diuretic or calcium channel blocker in the general black population.
- If the target blood pressure is not reached within one month after initiating therapy, the dosage of the initial medication should be increased, or a second medication should be added.

Pharmacologic Treatment In the general nonblack population, including those with diabetes, initial anti-hypertensive treatment should include a thiazide diuretic, calcium channel blocker, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, or angiotensin receptor blocker. In the general black population, including those with diabetes, initial treatment should include a thiazide diuretic or calcium channel blocker. If the target blood pressure is not reached within one month after initiating therapy, the dosage of the initial medication should be increased or a second medication should be added. Blood pressure should be monitored and the treatment regimen adjusted until the target blood pressure is reached.

A third drug should be added if necessary; however, if the target blood pressure cannot be achieved using only the drug classes listed above, antihypertensive drugs from other classes can be used. Referral to a physician with expertise in treating hypertension may be necessary for patients who do not reach the target blood pressure using these strategies. Adults with CKD and hypertension should receive an ACE inhibitor or ARB as initial or add-on therapy, based on moderate evidence that these medications improve kidney-related outcomes in these patients.

### Review of hypertension treatment… [^117DKjSW]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

Hypertension, defined as persistent systolic blood pressure at least 130 mm Hg or diastolic BP at least 80 mm Hg, affects approximately 116 million adults in the US and more than 1 billion adults worldwide. Hypertension is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease events and death. Observations First-line therapy for hypertension is lifestyle modification, including weight loss, healthy dietary pattern that includes low sodium and high potassium intake, physical activity, and moderation or elimination of alcohol consumption. The BP-lowering effects of individual lifestyle components are partially additive and enhance the efficacy of pharmacologic therapy. The decision to initiate antihypertensive medication should be based on the level of BP and the presence of high atherosclerotic CVD risk.

First-line drug therapy for hypertension consists of a thiazide or thiazidelike diuretic such as hydrochlorothiazide or chlorthalidone, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker such as enalapril or candesartan, and a calcium channel blocker such as amlodipine and should be titrated according to office and home SBP/DBP levels to achieve in most people an SBP/DBP target. Randomized clinical trials have established the efficacy of BP lowering to reduce the risk of CVD morbidity and mortality. An SBP reduction of 10 mm Hg decreases risk of CVD events by approximately 20% to 30%. Despite the benefits of BP control, only 44% of US adults with hypertension have their SBP/DBP controlled to less than 140/90 mm Hg.

Conclusions and Relevance Hypertension affects approximately 116 million adults in the US and more than 1 billion adults worldwide and is a leading cause of CVD morbidity and mortality. First-line therapy for hypertension is lifestyle modification, consisting of weight loss, dietary sodium reduction and potassium supplementation, healthy dietary pattern, physical activity, and limited alcohol consumption. When drug therapy is required, first-line therapies are thiazide or thiazidelike diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blockers, and calcium channel blockers.

### Abstract… [^115qwZwT]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

Choice of Agents Figure 1 is an algorithm that can guide combination therapy in patients with hypertension. 1, 6 JNC8, ESC, and ACC/AHA guidelines agree that for most patients, combination therapy should include a thiazide diuretic, a CCB, and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or ARB. They further agree that a patient should not take an ACEI and ARB simultaneously. 4–6 Therapy should be escalated at one-month intervals using any of the three accepted strategies.
6. The ACC/AHA recommends chlortha lidone as the preferred thiazide diuretic and recommends that central-acting alpha agonists be avoided. 31 The JNC8 found insufficient evidence to recommend preferential use of ACEIs or ARBs in patients with heart failure and hypertension 6; however, the JNC8 recommendations were published before the PARADIGM-HF results.

The beta blockers carvedilol, extended-release metoprolol, and bisoprolol have shown improvements in morbidity and mortality. One of these agents should be initiated in patients with HFrEF unless they have contraindications. 32–34 Beta blockers are usually added once the patient no longer has symptoms of volume overload. ACEIs and ARBs reduce proteinuria and decrease progression to end-stage renal disease in patients with proteinuria. DIABETES Using a fixed-dose combination of an ACEI and a thiazide diuretic in adults with diabetes, the Avoiding Cardiovascular Events Through Combination Therapy in Patients Living with Systolic Hypertension trial showed that a blood pressure decrease of 5. 6/2. 2 mm Hg led to lower rates of microvascular and macrovascular events and of cardiovascular and all-cause mortality.

5, 6 A meta-analysis showed that ACEIs — but not ARBs — reduce the incidence of doubling of the serum creatinine level in patients with diabetes, but they do not affect progression to end-stage renal disease. 46 Another meta-analysis showed that ACEIs are superior to ARBs in reducing all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. 47 The ACCOMPLISH trial showed that patients with diabetes who are treated with a combined ACEI/CCB have a lower risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events compared with those treated with a combined ACEI/thiazide diuretic. 48.

### On-treatment diastolic blood pressure and prognosis in systolic hypertension… [^117Lg8Ku]. JAMA Network (2007). Excellent credibility.

These findings support the hypothesis that antihypertensive treatment can be intensified to prevent cardiovascular events when systolic BP is not under control in older patients with systolic hypertension, at least until diastolic BP reaches 55 mm Hg. However, a prudent approach is warranted in patients with concomitant coronary heart disease, in whom diastolic BP should probably not be lowered to less than 70 mm Hg. Patients were randomized to active medication or matched placebo groups. Active treatment consisted of nitrendipine, which could be combined with or replaced by enalapril maleate or hydrochlorothiazide or both drugs, to reduce the sitting systolic BP by 20 mm Hg or more and to less than 150 mm Hg.

At the last follow-up visit, 2070 patients in the active treatment group and 1782 patients in the placebo group received active study medication or placebo tablets; the study medication was combined with open-label antihypertensive drugs in 220 actively treated patients and 51 patients in the placebo group. One hundred fifty-seven patients in the active treatment group and 241 patients in the placebo group received open-label antihypertensive drugs only. This was not the case with active treatment. The CHD risk remained unchanged at lower diastolic BP with both active therapy and placebo. No significant association was found between the risk of all cardiovascular events and on-treatment diastolic BP during either active treatment or placebo administration.

First-line treatment in the SHEP trial was a diuretic, with the possible addition of the β-blocker atenolol or reserpine for better BP control; in the Syst-Eur Trial, treatment was started with the dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker nitrendipine, to which the converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril and hydrochlorothiazide could be added. In conclusion, these findings support the hypothesis that antihypertensive treatment can be intensified for the prevention of cardiovascular events when systolic BP is not under control in older patients with isolated systolic hypertension, at least until diastolic BP reaches about 55 mm Hg. However, a prudent approach is warranted in patients with isolated systolic hypertension and concomitant CHD, in whom diastolic BP should probably not be lowered to less than 70 mm Hg, when the relative risk reaches about 1. 1.
