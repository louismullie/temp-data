## Question

What are the key laboratory findings that indicate coagulopathy in sepsis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the key laboratory findings that indicate coagulopathy in sepsis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology that drives sepsis-induced coagulopathy and how it translates into lab abnormalities. Then, I should verify which routine tests are most sensitive and specific for early detection. Next, I will review validated scoring systems that operationalize these labs. After that, I need to check the role and limitations of viscoelastic testing. Finally, I will consider special contexts like pediatrics and COVID-19, and synthesize a practical, prioritized list of key findings with prognostic implications.

> Let me first confirm the pathophysiologic framework, because the lab pattern reflects mechanism. Sepsis-induced coagulopathy arises from immune–coagulation crosstalk with tissue factor–driven thrombin generation, consumption of platelets and clotting factors, impaired anticoagulant pathways, and fibrinolytic shutdown from high PAI-1, which together produce a dynamic spectrum from compensated SIC to overt DIC with bleeding or thrombosis [^1169rwHG] [^117S1D8M].

> Wait, let me verify the earliest and most consistent routine markers. Thrombocytopenia is typically the initial manifestation in sepsis, often preceding other abnormalities, and its severity correlates with mortality and organ failure risk; very low platelets (< 50 × 10⁹/L) signal a more disturbed host response and worse outcomes, so I should prioritize platelet count as a sentinel marker [^1111Bguz] [^111EGUy1] [^1126y6Vq].

> I need to check the role of global clotting assays next. Prolongation of PT/INR reflects consumptive coagulopathy and impaired extrinsic pathway function; in sepsis cohorts, PT prolongation is common and, when marked, associates with endothelial injury and inflammation even after adjustment for severity, though its prognostic independence varies by analysis, so I should interpret PT/INR alongside platelets and clinical context rather than in isolation [^1126y6Vq] [^11181Lny] [^116BxHTn].

> Hold on, I should verify the significance of fibrin-related markers. Elevated D-dimer and fibrin degradation products indicate ongoing fibrin formation and secondary fibrinolysis; in early sepsis, D-dimer is almost universally elevated and tracks with disease severity, though specificity is limited and trends matter more than single values, so rising D-dimer in the right clinical setting supports consumptive coagulopathy and higher risk of progression to DIC [^113c7Y4C] [^115vjQw6] [^113hYeQJ].

> Let me consider fibrinogen carefully, because I initially thought low fibrinogen would be an early sign; wait, that's not quite right. In early sepsis, fibrinogen is often normal or elevated as an acute-phase reactant, and only declines with progressive consumption in overt DIC, so a falling fibrinogen from a previously high baseline is a red flag for decompensation rather than a sensitive early marker [^115vjQw6] [^114eTgS7].

> Next, I should review validated scoring systems that translate these labs into standardized diagnoses. The ISTH overt DIC score uses platelet count, PT, fibrinogen, and fibrin markers, while the SIC score (platelets, PT/INR, SOFA) detects earlier, nonovert DIC in sepsis and predicts mortality; mISTH removes fibrinogen to improve early detection, and JAAM adds SIRS to increase sensitivity, so using SIC or mISTH for early risk stratification and ISTH for overt DIC is a pragmatic approach [^117Gqdiq] [^112VRHpu] [^114eTgS7].

> I will now examine viscoelastic testing, because static plasmatic tests miss cellular contributions and fibrinolysis. TEG/ROTEM can reveal hypercoagulability early and hypocoagulability later, with reduced maximum clot firmness correlating with DIC and mortality; however, results are heterogeneous across studies, reference ranges are not standardized for sepsis, and sequential measurements improve interpretability, so I should treat viscoelastic patterns as complementary rather than replacements for routine labs [^113suhnh] [^115SPrR5] [^1177rNxL].

> But wait, what if the patient is a child or has COVID-19 rather than bacterial sepsis. In pediatrics, thrombocytopenia remains a key consumptive coagulopathy signal and low platelets predict mortality, while guidelines advise against prophylactic plasma in nonbleeding children with sepsis and coagulopathy; in COVID-19, D-dimer and fibrinogen are markedly elevated with relatively preserved platelets and PT early on, reflecting a hypercoagulable endotheliopathy rather than classic consumptive DIC, so I should adjust thresholds and expectations accordingly [^115g43su] [^1166i38A] [^116umT3X] [^114UssdE].

> Let me synthesize the key laboratory findings in order of clinical utility and timeliness. The most sensitive early markers are thrombocytopenia and PT/INR prolongation, with D-dimer elevation nearly universal in severe sepsis; fibrinogen is often normal early and declines with progression, and viscoelastic testing can uncover hyper- or hypocoagulability missed by plasmatic assays; integrating these into SIC or mISTH scores enables early risk stratification and surveillance for progression to overt DIC [^1111Bguz] [^113c7Y4C] [^115vjQw6] [^114GtYRt].

> Hold on, I should verify prognostic implications to ensure clinical relevance. The severity of thrombocytopenia and the degree of PT prolongation correlate with mortality, and dynamic worsening of coagulation parameters over the first day of severe sepsis predicts progression to multiple organ failure and death; persistent coagulopathy at discharge also portends long-term mortality, reinforcing the value of serial monitoring and incorporating coagulation trends into decision-making [^111EGUy1] [^116BM7uQ] [^114u4P4P].

> Finally, I need to ensure practical application. In suspected sepsis, obtain CBC with platelets, PT/INR, aPTT, fibrinogen, and D-dimer at baseline, repeat platelets and PT/INR at least daily, and consider TEG/ROTEM where available to profile functional hemostasis; calculate SIC or mISTH to detect early coagulopathy, escalate surveillance as scores rise, and anticipate that falling fibrinogen signals transition to overt DIC, prompting reassessment of bleeding risk and transfusion thresholds while treating the underlying sepsis source [^114eTgS7] [^115vjQw6] [^113suhnh].

---

The key laboratory findings indicating coagulopathy in sepsis are **thrombocytopenia** (platelets < 150 × 10⁹/L or a > 30% drop) [^114GtYRt], **prolonged PT/INR** (INR > 1.2) [^112VRHpu], and **elevated D-dimer** (> 2× upper limit of normal) [^113tkhZf], reflecting consumptive coagulopathy and fibrin formation [^115vjQw6]. Additional markers include **low fibrinogen** (< 1.5 g/L) in late or severe cases [^115vjQw6], prolonged aPTT, and reduced antithrombin and protein C activity [^113c7Y4C]. Viscoelastic testing (TEG/ROTEM) can reveal hypocoagulability or hypercoagulability and is useful for detecting fibrinolytic shutdown [^113suhnh] [^116FHZ4P]. These abnormalities correlate with severity and mortality, and serial monitoring is essential to detect progression to overt DIC [^116BM7uQ] [^112EebvR].

---

## Platelet count

- **Thrombocytopenia**: Platelet count < 150 × 10⁹/L or a > 30% decrease within 24 hours is a hallmark of sepsis-induced coagulopathy (SIC) and is included in the ISTH SIC score [^114GtYRt] [^112VRHpu].

- **Severity correlation**: Lower platelet counts correlate with higher mortality and organ dysfunction [^111EGUy1].

- **Early marker**: Thrombocytopenia often precedes other coagulation abnormalities, making it an early indicator of SIC [^1111Bguz].

---

## Prothrombin time (PT) and international normalized ratio (INR)

- **Prolonged PT/INR**: PT prolongation or INR > 1.2 indicates consumptive coagulopathy and is a core component of the ISTH SIC score [^114GtYRt] [^112VRHpu].

- **Frequency**: PT prolongation is common in sepsis, with incidence up to 93% in severe cases [^1126y6Vq].

- **Prognostic value**: Prolonged PT independently predicts mortality and organ dysfunction [^116BM7uQ] [^115hygqZ].

---

## Activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT)

Prolonged aPTT reflects **consumption of intrinsic pathway factors** and is common in sepsis, though less specific than PT/INR [^1111Bguz]. It is often used alongside PT/INR to assess global coagulation status [^112FaoWG].

---

## Fibrinogen levels

- **Early elevation**: Fibrinogen is an acute-phase reactant and may be normal or elevated early in sepsis despite ongoing coagulation activation [^115vjQw6].

- **Late decline**: Hypofibrinogenemia (< 1.5 g/L) indicates advanced consumptive coagulopathy and is associated with poor outcomes [^115vjQw6].

- **ISTH DIC criteria**: Low fibrinogen is part of the ISTH overt DIC score, but not the SIC score due to its limited early utility [^113e5zCt] [^114eTgS7].

---

## D-dimer and fibrin degradation products (FDPs)

Elevated D-dimer (> 2× ULN) reflects **fibrin formation and breakdown** and is a sensitive marker of SIC, though nonspecific [^115vjQw6]. High D-dimer correlates with severity and mortality in sepsis [^116BM7uQ] [^113c7Y4C].

---

## Antithrombin and protein C activity

Reduced antithrombin and protein C activity reflect **consumption and impaired synthesis** in sepsis and are associated with worse outcomes [^113c7Y4C] [^117HkYrV]. These deficiencies contribute to the prothrombotic state in SIC [^113hYeQJ].

---

## Viscoelastic testing (TEG/ROTEM)

- **Whole-blood assessment**: TEG/ROTEM provide real-time assessment of clot formation, strength, and fibrinolysis, revealing hypo- or hypercoagulability often missed by conventional tests [^113suhnh].

- **Hypocoagulability**: Reduced maximum amplitude (MA) or clot firmness indicates low platelet/fibrinogen and predicts DIC and mortality [^1177rNxL].

- **Fibrinolysis**: TEG/ROTEM can detect fibrinolytic shutdown, which is common in sepsis and linked to poor outcomes [^116FHZ4P].

---

## Summary of key laboratory findings

| **Laboratory parameter** | **Typical findings in sepsis coagulopathy** | **Clinical significance** |
|-|-|-|
| Platelet count | < 150 × 10⁹/L or > 30% decrease | Early, sensitive marker; correlates with severity |
| PT/INR | Prolonged (INR > 1.2) | Indicates consumptive coagulopathy |
| aPTT | Prolonged | Reflects intrinsic pathway consumption |
| Fibrinogen | Normal or elevated early; < 1.5 g/L late | Late marker of consumption |
| D-dimer | Elevated (> 2× ULN) | Sensitive marker of fibrin formation/breakdown |
| Antithrombin/Protein C | Decreased | Reflects consumption and impaired synthesis |
| TEG/ROTEM | Hypocoagulable profile (↓ MA) or fibrinolytic shutdown | Functional assessment; predicts DIC and mortality |

---

## Clinical implications

- **Risk stratification**: These laboratory findings enable early identification of SIC and risk stratification for progression to overt DIC and mortality [^114GtYRt] [^112EebvR].

- **Guideline support**: The ISTH SIC score, incorporating platelet count, PT/INR, and SOFA, is recommended for early detection of SIC [^114GtYRt] [^112VRHpu].

- **Monitoring**: Serial measurements are essential to track progression and guide therapy, including transfusion and anticoagulation decisions [^1141u3tz] [^116BM7uQ].

---

The key laboratory findings indicating coagulopathy in sepsis are **thrombocytopenia**, **prolonged PT/INR**, and **elevated D-dimer**, with additional support from aPTT, fibrinogen, antithrombin, protein C, and viscoelastic testing. These abnormalities reflect consumptive coagulopathy, endothelial injury, and fibrinolytic disturbances, and their severity correlates with clinical outcomes [^115YaDZf] [^113c7Y4C].

Physiological hemostasis is a balance between pro- and anticoagulant pathways, and in sepsis, this equilibrium is disturbed, resulting in systemic thrombin generation, impaired anticoagulant activity, and suppression of fibrinolysis, a condition termed sepsis-induced coagulopathy (SIC). SIC is a common complication, being present in 24% of patients with sepsis and 66% of patients with septic shock, and is often associated with poor clinical outcomes and high mortality. 1, 2 Recent preclinical and clinical studies have generated new insights into the molecular pathogenesis of SIC. In this article, we analyze the complex pathophysiology of SIC with a focus on the role of procoagulant innate immune signaling in hemostatic activation — tissue factor production, thrombin generation, endotheliopathy, and impaired antithrombotic functions. We also review clinical presentations of SIC, the diagnostic scoring system and laboratory tests, the current standard of care, and clinical trials evaluating the efficacies of anticoagulant therapies.

As a consequence of mixed data regarding the clinical benefit of anticoagulant therapy in septic patients, the Surviving Sepsis Campaign does not recommend targeted antithrombotic treatments. However, different criteria for diagnosis of coagulopathy and/or broad inclusion of all septic patients regardless of coagulation status may have contributed to the inconsistent clinical trial results. Improved outcomes from anticoagulant therapy may only be demonstrated in a subset of septic patients as therapeutic efficacy is dependent on specific patient factors, and type and degree of coagulopathy.

Introduction

Sepsis is defined as a dysregulated host response to infection causing life-threatening organ dysfunctionand is marked by both inflammatory and immunosuppressive phases with tremendous morbidity and mortality. For the surgeon, sepsis is understood as both a critically time-sensitive condition with need for immediate source-control measures, as well as a potentially chronic illness with downstream effects on morbidity and mortality for many years after diagnosis. Despite increased national and hospital-led public health campaigns to raise awareness and improve the timeliness of diagnosis, mortality from acute sepsis approaches 25% or even higher depending on its severity. Sepsis is a heterogeneous disease state with distinct phenotypic signatures, but generally speaking, sepsis survivors diverge into two categories: those who fully recover and those who enter the continuum of chronic critical illness (CCI).

Disordered coagulation is a hallmark of sepsis, affecting 50% to 70% of patients, with alterations in coagulation ranging from benign laboratory aberrations to disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC). The severity of sepsis-associated coagulopathy is directly linked to worse outcomes, including inpatient length of stay (LOS) and mortality. Coagulation abnormalities during CCI are less clearly understood. However, there is growing evidence that coagulopathy may distinguish patients at greatest risk for poor outcomes after sepsis. A recent prospective study found that 19% of patients with CCI had coagulopathy at admission compared with only 3% of sepsis 'rapid recovery' survivors, suggesting that coagulation abnormalities may identify patients more prone to CCI and persistent multiple organ failure (MOF).

In this review, we will briefly outline the pathophysiology of sepsis-associated coagulopathy and DIC. We will then examine the existing literature on coagulopathy and associated outcomes in sepsis survivors and patients with CCI with the objective of highlighting the need for further dedicated research in this field.

### Sepsis-induced coagulopathy: a comprehensive narrative review of pathophysiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and management strategies [^117S1D8M]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2024). Medium credibility.

Sepsis-induced coagulopathy (SIC) is a major complication in sepsis. SIC is present in 24% of patients with sepsis and is associated with a 2-fold increase in mortality. SIC is characterized by systemic inflammation and coagulation activation leading to microvascular thrombi, impaired organ perfusion, and subsequent organ dysfunction. SIC is often used synonymously with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), but in DIC, there is an overt or gross consumptive intravascular coagulopathy, meaning significant reductions in platelets, fibrinogen, and clotting factors with clinical evidence of thrombotic and/or bleeding diathesis. In comparison, SIC is a type of nonovert DIC, also described by a systemic intravascular coagulation, but without gross consumption of platelets, fibrinogen, and clotting factors, and often preempts the decompensated coagulopathy of DIC.

SIC is a complex condition triggered by pathological interactions between the innate immune and the coagulation systems. However, detailed understanding of the normal and dysregulated interactions of these systems and their components––to improve diagnostic accuracy and develop targeted therapeutics––represents a significant knowledge gap in SIC and is the goal of ongoing research. This article is a critical review of the literature on SIC in the following areas: (1) the experimental evidence of pathogen- and host-derived inflammatory molecules linked to hemostatic activation in sepsis, (2) the systemic impact of dysregulated immunothrombotic responses and the resultant clinical presentations, (3) the clinical diagnostic criteria for SIC, (4) the experimental therapies targeting imbalanced coagulation in SIC, and (5) the gaps in our knowledge of the pathophysiology, presentation, and management of SIC.

### Enigmatic role of coagulopathy among sepsis survivors: a review of coagulation abnormalities and their possible link to chronic critical illness [^114qMUqj]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2020). Medium credibility.

There are sparse clinical data addressing the persistence of disordered coagulation in sepsis and its role in chronic critical illness. Coagulopathy in the absence of anticoagulant therapy and/or liver disease can be highly variable in sepsis, but it tends to be prolonged in patients in the intensive care unit with a length of stay greater than 14 days. These coagulation abnormalities tend to precede multisystem organ failure and persistence of these coagulation derangements can predict 28-day mortality. The studies evaluated in this review consistently link sepsis-associated coagulopathy to poor long-term outcomes and indicate that disordered coagulation is associated with unfavorable outcomes in chronic critical illness. However, the causative mechanism and the definitive link remain unclear. Longer follow-up and more granular data will be required to fully understand coagulopathy in the context of chronic critical illness.

SUMMARY

SIC is a complication of sepsis involving dysregulated coagulation that is mechanistically linked to innate immune activation and contributes to organ injury and high mortality. While immune-mediated thrombin generation, platelet activation, endotheliopathy, and impaired antithrombotic mechanism are separate mechanistic pathways, they interact in a coordinated fashion in the pathogenesis of SIC. The current therapeutic approaches in treating SIC have focused on reintroducing exogenous regulators of these systems, but their effectiveness appears to lie in accurate and timely diagnostics. Clarification of underlying mechanisms in SIC has continued, but efforts to develop targeted therapeutics have stalled. New focus and insight into pathological mechanisms underlying coagulopathy will help advance translational approaches to rapid diagnosis and prognosis of SIC to identify patients who would benefit most from therapies.

### How we manage haemostasis during sepsis [^1111Bguz]. British Journal of Haematology (2019). Medium credibility.

Sepsis may be associated with activation of the coagulation system and, in its most severe form, may result in disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Initially, there is thrombosis primarily affecting small and medium sized vessels and contributing to organ dysfunction, but continued activation results in consumption of coagulation factors. This results in prolongation of global coagulation parameters. Often thrombocytopenia is the initial feature in sepsis, which may be followed by prolongation of global coagulation assays, and in severe cases, associated with hypofibrinogenaemia, with overactivation of the fibrinolytic path. The end result is a bleeding phenotype. Scoring systems can be used to help identify patients at risk of DIC and aid in confirming a diagnosis of DIC utilising routine laboratory parameters. Discussion includes medical and blood product support of haemostasis, from thrombotic to bleeding states, in relation to sepsis trigger.

Table 1
Review of the literature regarding coagulopathy and outcomes among sepsis survivors

Although these studies establish that disordered coagulation is associated with unfavorable outcomes for sepsis survivors, there are some notable limitations stemming from non-uniform methodology. Median ICU LOS qualified only some subjects as true patients with CCI. Therefore, without subgroup analyses of mortality among patients with ICU admission > 14 days, these data are less generalizable to CCI. There was also immense variability in how coagulopathy was defined, and which coagulation parameters were assessed. Although the data consistently linked sepsis-associated coagulopathy to poor outcomes, it was unclear whether the causative mechanism was deficient coagulation or poor fibrinolysis. It is also questionable whether short-term outcomes are even pertinent for CCI, which implies a more indolent course. Some argue that CCI mortality plateaus at 3 months and that longer follow-up is resource intensive and confounds survival data since patients may die to non-CCI-related causes such as cancer or trauma. While dysregulated coagulation is often observed on the day of sepsis diagnosis, longer follow-up and more granular data are required to understand coagulopathy in the context of CCI. This may be achieved through greater multidisciplinary and/or multi-institutional collaboration to foster creation of consensus CCI guidelines and standardize language for research and clinical purposes.

Conclusions

Sepsis-associated coagulopathy is a frequent and well-described clinical phenomenon that can lead to organ dysfunction. By contrast, coagulation during CCI is poorly understood with few animal or clinical studies revealing its pathophysiology, incidence, presentation, or clinical outcomes. Septic patients who experience coagulopathy are more likely to progress to organ failure, and those with improvements in coagulation demonstrate greater incidence of MOF resolution. Additionally, this disordered coagulation introduces a greater risk of morbidity during surgical source control, which has the potential to lead to an even more complicated course. However, the coagulopathy of sepsis is just one facet that leads to persistent organ dysfunction and primes patients for the development of CCI. The association between them has been proven, but the link is still unknown.

This review illustrates that coagulopathy does persist in sepsis survivors and that abnormal coagulation at the time of admission and discharge predicts mortality outcomes up to 1 year after sepsis diagnosis. There is very compelling evidence of the impact of coagulopathy on outcomes in CCI, but further studies are needed to prove more than correlation between the two. None of the discussed studies explored the association between coagulopathy, persistent organ dysfunction, and mortality among a strict CCI population. A thorough examination of the temporal trends of coagulopathy among sepsis survivors is needed to elucidate whether such abnormalities in CCI represent progression versus de novo disease and whether they directly contribute to MOF. Future clinical work should also track outcomes for a greater duration of time given that CCI incurs long-term immunologic, functional, nutritional, and lifestyle morbidity that shorter term measures fail to capture. Together, these data may help classify patients into CCI phenotypes, similar to acute sepsis. Predicting which patients with coagulopathy will ultimately develop persistent MOF and CCI is clinically useful because it may guide resource utilization decisions, facilitate family discussions about goals of care, and to some extent direct patient management in both the acute stages of disease and in the chronic illness state that follows. Unfortunately, until there are better clinical targets, treatment options, and biomarkers to follow therapeutic efficacy, the ability to minimize excessive inflammation, restore immunologic homeostasis, and prevent organ dysfunction in sepsis survivors is not yet possible. However, along with the foundations in the literature reviewed here, perhaps future studies focusing on coagulopathy in CCI may help inform our decision-making for sepsis survivors to improve overall outcomes for these patients.

While DIC is considered an independent predictor of mortality during critical illness and is associated with a 1.5-fold greater mortality rate in septic patients compared with those with less severe forms of coagulopathy, no single test is sufficient for detecting DIC. In the appropriate clinical setting, accurate diagnosis requires examining numerous laboratory tests, including platelet count, fibrin markers, fibrinogen, and prothrombin time (PT). Because of the simultaneous activation and downregulation of separate parts of the coagulation process during sepsis, timely monitoring of coagulation changes is important in the recognition and treatment of sepsis-induced coagulopathy and DIC. In current practice, thromboelastography (TEG) is the most efficient and advantageous measure of clotting function in real time. Specific indicators in TEG testing, such as R value, K time, α angle, maximum amplitude value and coagulation index, have been shown to correlate with the severity of the patient's sepsis by both Sequential Organ Failure Assessment and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II scores, and can better determine platelet functionality than traditional coagulation laboratories. Many studies have been conducted to evaluate the utility of TEG on clinical diagnosis of sepsis-induced coagulopathy. Among these, wide variation is seen with regard to detection of hypercoagulability and hypocoagulability, likely from non-uniform collection times, varying degrees of disease severity, and deviations in definitions. However, overall trends indicate that a hypocoagulable profile is associated with increased MOF, along with increased mortality in sepsis.

### Consumptive coagulopathy is associated with a disturbed host response in patients with sepsis [^1126y6Vq]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2021). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Prothrombin time (PT) is a widely used test to detect coagulation abnormalities in critically ill patients. 1, 2 The reported incidence of a prolonged PT, indicative of consumptive coagulopathy, ranges from 30% to 66% in the overall intensive care unit (ICU) population, 3, 4 with an even higher incidence in critically ill patients with sepsis (up to 93%). 5 A prolonged PT on ICU admission was reported to be an independent risk factor for mortality in both critically ill patients 4 and patients with severe sepsis. 5, 6, 7

Besides PT, platelet counts are commonly used to determine the extent of coagulation activation. 1, 2 The recently introduced term "sepsis‐associated coagulopathy" is defined by the presence of low platelet counts and a prolonged PT. 6 We previously reported that low platelet counts in ICU patients with sepsis are independently associated with increased mortality and a more disturbed host response. 8 Sepsis patients with platelet counts below 50 × 10⁹/L showed enhanced activation of the cytokine network and the vascular endothelium; a more profound loss of vascular integrity; and a distinct whole‐blood leukocyte transcriptome pattern revealing decreased leukocyte adhesion, diapedesis, and extravasation signaling. 8 This observational study provided validity to a series of mouse studies documenting a protective and immune regulatory role of platelets in experimental sepsis. 9, 10, 11 Considering the pleiotropic functions of platelets beyond their role in hemostasis, 9, 10, 11 our earlier investigation left unanswered whether coagulation activation per se impacts the host response in patients with sepsis. This question is relevant in view of laboratory and animal studies pointing at an extensive cross‐talk between coagulation factors and endothelial cell function and inflammation, as well as investigations reporting protection against the lethal consequences of fulminant sepsis by inhibition of components of the coagulation system. 12, 13

Our objective was to assess the association between consumptive coagulopathy, as reflected by a prolonged PT, and host response aberrations in patients admitted to the ICU with sepsis. To this end we measured 19 biomarkers indicative of coagulation activation, endothelial cell activation, and systemic inflammation in sepsis patients stratified according to admission PT. Additionally, in an unbiased approach we compared genome‐wide messenger (m)RNA profiles in blood leukocytes obtained from patients with a normal or extremely prolonged PT.

### Dynamic evolution of coagulopathy in the first day of severe sepsis: relationship with mortality and organ failure [^116BM7uQ]. Critical Care Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine whether changes in coagulation biomarkers during the first day of severe sepsis correlate with progression from single to multiple organ failure and subsequent death.

Design

Analysis of secondary endpoints in a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, multinational clinical trial (PROWESS).

Setting

The study involved 164 medical centers.

Patients

A total of 840 patients who met criteria for severe sepsis and were randomized to receive placebo plus supportive care.

Interventions

None.

Measurements and Main Results

Coagulation biomarkers, prothrombin time, antithrombin activity, and D-dimer and protein C levels were measured, and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment was performed daily. Multiple logistic regression analysis identified baseline antithrombin activity < 54% and changes in prothrombin time, D-dimer, and antithrombin activity during the first calendar day after the onset of the first sepsis-induced organ dysfunction (i.e., the first day of severe sepsis, day 1) as predictive of 28-day mortality (p ≤ .01). A composite coagulopathy score was determined using points for predetermined levels of change from baseline to day 1. The composite coagulopathy score correlated with progression from single to multiple organ failure (p = .0007), time to resolution of organ failure (p = .0004), and 28-day mortality (p < .0001). Combining the composite coagulopathy score with the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score improved ability to identify patients who would progress to multiple organ failure (area under receiver operating characteristic curve 0.61 APACHE II vs. 0.65 APACHE II + composite coagulopathy score) and who would die (area under receiver operating characteristic curve 0.69 APACHE II vs. 0.74 APACHE II + composite coagulopathy score).

Conclusions

Continuation or worsening of coagulopathy during the first day of severe sepsis was associated with increased development of new organ failure and 28-day mortality. These results further suggest that coagulation abnormalities contribute to organ failure and death.

Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is a life-threatening complication in sepsis and other critical conditions. The International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) released the diagnostic criteria for overt DIC in 2001. Since then, ISTH overt DIC has been used as the global standard criterion for a decompensated stage of DIC. Because detecting an earlier stage of DIC would be useful for therapeutic considerations, the scientific standardization committees of the ISTH introduced the sepsis-induced coagulopathy (SIC) scoring system in 2019. The SIC scoring system is specifically designed to detect the compensated phase of DIC in sepsis, which can lead to overt DIC with disease progression. Studies examining the performance of the SIC scoring system have reported its usefulness over the past 5 years. The reported incidence of SIC was approximately 60% in patients with sepsis, which was twice as much as that of overt DIC. Almost all patients with overt DIC were diagnosed with SIC earlier. The reported mortality of SIC was ≥ 30% and, thus, can be used for patient selection for anticoagulant therapy. Despite the limited data, some continue to suggest the potential efficacy of anticoagulant therapy in patients with SIC. Although heparin, antithrombin, and thrombomodulin are the candidates for anticoagulation, none of them have proven to be effective with robust evidence, and future trials are warranted.

Figure 3.
Clinical laboratory features and trends in SIC. Sepsis-induced coagulopathy is a form of nonovert DIC in septic patients in which intravascular coagulation driven by inflammatory-mediated TF expression results in TAT and mild-to-moderate consumption of platelets and endogenous anticoagulants (ATIII). Further, PAI-1 is significantly elevated, resulting in early suppression of fibrinolysis. The coagulopathy in SIC can progress to overt DIC of a thrombotic phenotype with overactive clotting and worsening consumption of clotting factors and platelets. Finally, elevated tPA antigen and markers of fibrinolysis (d-dimer) characterize overt DIC of a predominant fibrinolytic phenotype. ↔ = no change, ↑ = mild changes, ↑↑ = moderate changes, and ↑↑↑ = severe changes.

If dysregulated immune-thrombotic responses continue, SIC can progress to overt DIC with gross consumption of fibrinogen, platelets, and antithrombotic proteins, and manifests as a thrombotic, fibrinolytic, or mixed coagulopathy (Figure 3). In DIC with thrombosis, there is overactive clotting and consumption of platelets and fibrinogen with suppressed or balanced fibrinolysis. In DIC with fibrinolysis, there are still significantly reduced platelet and fibrinogen levels, but with pronounced fibrin breakdown, and elevations in plasma fibrinolytic markers (eg, d-dimer), resulting in excessive bleeding. The presence of severe thrombocytopenia (platelets < 50 × 10⁹/L) is independently associated with lower survival, and higher plasma levels of cytokines and EC injury markers, and patients with significant reductions in plasma fibrinogen levels < 200 mg/dL also showed increased mortality. In 1 retrospective study, 30% of patients diagnosed with septic shock progressed to overt DIC 3 days after admission, and had lower platelet counts and higher 28-day mortality compared to the SIC (nonovert DIC in sepsis) group. These studies highlight the critical need to identify and prevent progression of SIC to the point of hemostatic deterioration and excessive mortality associated with DIC.

Essentials

A prolonged prothrombin time (PT) is a feature in sepsis indicating consumptive coagulopathy.
We report an observational study in sepsis patients admitted to the intensive care unit of two Dutch hospitals.
A prolonged PT was associated with a more disturbed endothelial barrier integrity and increased inflammation.
This association occurred independent of differences in disease severity.

### Sepsis-associated coagulopathy severity predicts hospital mortality [^112EebvR]. Critical Care Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

To assess whether sepsis-associated coagulopathy predicts hospital mortality.

Design

Retrospective cohort study.

Setting

One-thousand three-hundred beds urban academic medical center.

Patients

Six-thousand one-hundred forty-eight consecutive patients hospitalized between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2015.

Interventions

Mild sepsis-associated coagulopathy was defined as an international normalized ratio greater than or equal to 1.2 and less than 1.4 plus platelet count less than or equal to 150,000/µL but greater than 100,000/µL; moderate sepsis-associated coagulopathy was defined with either an international normalized ratio greater than or equal to 1.4 but less than 1.6 or platelets less than or equal to 100,000/µL but greater than 80,000/µL; severe sepsis-associated coagulopathy was defined as an international normalized ratio greater than or equal to 1.6 and platelets less than or equal to 80,000/µL.

Measurements and Main Results

Hospital mortality increased progressively from 25.4% in patients without sepsis-associated coagulopathy to 56.1% in patients with severe sepsis-associated coagulopathy. Similarly, duration of hospitalization and ICU care increased progressively as sepsis-associated coagulopathy severity increased. Multivariable analyses showed that the presence of sepsis-associated coagulopathy, as well as sepsis-associated coagulopathy severity, was independently associated with hospital mortality regardless of adjustments made for baseline patient characteristics, hospitalization variables, and the sepsis-associated coagulopathy-cancer interaction. Odds ratios ranged from 1.33 to 2.14 for the presence of sepsis-associated coagulopathy and from 1.18 to 1.51 for sepsis-associated coagulopathy severity for predicting hospital mortality (p < 0.001 for all comparisons).

Conclusions

The presence of sepsis-associated coagulopathy identifies a group of patients with sepsis at higher risk for mortality. Furthermore, there is an incremental risk of mortality as the severity of sepsis-associated coagulopathy increases.

### Consumptive coagulopathy is associated with a disturbed host response in patients with sepsis [^117HkYrV]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2021). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

Consumptive coagulopathy is a common complication in patients with sepsis caused by strong activation of the coagulation system and manifested by a prolonged PT. 1, 2, 5, 6 While multilevel interactions between mediators of coagulation and other host response mechanisms have been documented in laboratory and animal investigations, 12, 13 knowledge of associations between plasmatic coagulation and the dysregulated host response in patients with sepsis is limited. We here utilized a large prospectively enrolled cohort of sepsis patients to show that a prolonged PT is associated with stronger aberrations in distinct host response mechanisms implicated in the pathogenesis of sepsis, including endothelial cell function and systemic inflammation, even after adjusting for confounding factors such as severity of disease.

In contrast to previous studies we did not find an independent association between admission PT and mortality. 5, 6, 7 Notably, two of these earlier investigations did not correct for severity of disease in their analyses, 5, 7 while the third used the total SOFA score for this. 6 In our stringent analysis, low platelet counts remained independently associated with 30‐day mortality, confirming our previous report. 8 This earlier publication also includes crude analyses on the association between platelet counts and mortality. 8 These results suggest that in patients with a prolonged PT, severity of disease rather than the extent of consumptive coagulopathy is the main (or sole) driver of mortality.

Patients with an extremely prolonged PT had lower plasma levels of the anticoagulant proteins protein C and antithrombin compared to patients with a normal PT matched for disease severity and several other factors that could influence plasma biomarker levels. Low antithrombin and protein C levels are common features in sepsis patients, likely caused by a combination of impaired synthesis, ongoing consumption, extravascular loss due to increased vascular permeability, increased clearance, and proteolytic degradation. 12, 13 Our data suggest that activation of the coagulation cascade may play a role in one or more of these processes, either directly (e.g. through increased complex formation between thrombin and antithrombin, resulting in enhanced clearance) or indirectly (e.g. through enhanced systemic inflammation and a more disturbed endothelial barrier function). Platelet counts did not differ between patients with an extremely prolonged PT versus those with a normal PT matched for disease severity, suggesting that activation of the coagulation cascade does not impact platelet activation and consumption. Conversely, we previously reported that thrombocytopenia in patients with sepsis is not associated with consumptive coagulopathy, as reflected by similar PTs in those with low (< 50 × 10⁹/L) and normal platelet counts. 8

### Enigmatic role of coagulopathy among sepsis survivors: a review of coagulation abnormalities and their possible link to chronic critical illness [^115H3Wa9]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2020). Medium credibility.

In a subsequent study from Guirgis et al, 110 septic patients were prospectively screened for the development of persistent (28–90 days) or long-term (greater than 90 days) organ dysfunction. Coagulopathy was defined as an international normalized ratio (INR) > 1.5 and a platelet count < 100 × 10⁹/L in the absence of anticoagulant therapy and/or liver disease. The overall rate of coagulopathy at admission was 25%, consistent with the previously discussed study. Among sepsis survivors with available data, 10% had persistent coagulopathy and 3% had long-term coagulopathy. Clinical outcomes of patients with coagulopathy were not evaluated, likely because the sample was underpowered to establish statistical trends. Interestingly, the authors found a significant association between elevated INR and persistent organ dysfunction, but they did not perform a multivariable analysis to determine whether coagulopathy independently predicted later organ failure. Nevertheless, the concept that an abnormal laboratory test of coagulation could predict eventual MOF is promising for identifying and staging patients, as well as pinpointing a window of intervention to prevent sepsis-related morbidity and mortality.

A handful of studies have investigated short and intermediate-term outcomes of early coagulopathy among sepsis survivors. In one single-center prospective study of septic patients, Koyama et al found that higher plasma thrombin-antithrombin complex (TAT) and PAI-1 levels 2 days after ICU admission predicted 28-day mortality. In a larger multi-institution study, Dhainaut et al assessed coagulopathy markers early in patients with severe sepsis as well as 28-day mortality rates and progression to MOF.PT, D-dimer, antithrombin activity, protein C activity, and platelet counts were trended temporally. The majority of patients had baseline coagulation abnormalities that preceded organ failure and changes in PT, antithrombin, D-dimer, and composite coagulation parameters from baseline to the first day after severe sepsis diagnosis predicted 28-day mortality. Worsening coagulopathy was also associated with MOF development, whereas improvements in coagulation were associated with resolution of MOF. The authors concluded that coagulation is a key mediator of sepsis outcomes. Finally, Massion et al found that deficient thrombin generation 3 days after the onset of septic shock was associated with greater inpatient and 90-day mortality. Taken together, these studies highlight that common coagulation parameters may help risk stratify septic patients and identify who is at risk to progress to MOF or early death.

### Thrombocytopenia and thrombosis in disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) [^11718YhC]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2009). Low credibility.

Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is the physiologic result of pathologic overstimulation of the coagulation system. Despite multiple triggers, a myriad of laboratory abnormalities, and a clinical presentation ranging from gross hemostatic failure to life-threatening thrombosis, or even both simultaneously, a simplified clinical approach augmented by a few readily available tests allows prompt identification of the process and elucidation of treatment opportunities. Platelet counts in DIC may be low, especially in acute sepsis-associated DIC, yet increased in malignancy-associated chronic DIC. Thrombotic risk is not a function of the platelet count, and thrombocytopenia does not protect the patient from thrombosis. The stratification of both thrombotic risk and hemorrhagic risk will be addressed.

9 per L), less than 4, 000 per μL, or greater than 10% immature forms. The overall sensitivity of the SIRS criteria for detecting sepsis is only about 50% to 60%, and one in eight patients admitted to the ICU with sepsis does not meet SIRS criteria. 10, 11 A limitation of the SIRS criteria is that SIRS may be present with noninfectious conditions such as autoimmune disorders, vasculitis, pancreatitis, burns, trauma, or recent surgery. 9, 12–14 Sepsis should be suspected in patients meeting at least two of the three qSOFA criteria: respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute or greater, altered mental status, and systolic blood pressure of 100 mm Hg or less. These patients should undergo additional evaluation. The qSOFA is limited by its low sensitivity and because it typically identifies patients who present late in the course of sepsis. 14 Nonetheless, Sepsis-3 includes qSOFA because it requires no laboratory testing and can be rapidly administered.

12, 13 Until additional diagnostic tools emerge, sepsis should be suspected in patients with a positive score on the SIRS criteria or qSOFA. 15 The full SOFA has been endorsed by the Society of Critical Care Medicine. Treatment FLUID RESUSCITATION The priorities in early sepsis management are establishing vascular access and initiating fluid resuscitation. Patients with sepsis should receive an intravenous crystalloid at 30 mL per kg within the first three hours. Several individual trials showed no difference in 28-day mortality benefit between resuscitation using a colloid and a crystalloid; however, a subsequent meta-analysis suggested a marginal mortality benefit with the use of albumin. 26, 45–47 Despite these findings, crystalloids are recommended for fluid resuscitation because of availability and lower cost.

Crystalloid formulations are unbalanced or balanced. Large-volume resuscitation with an unbalanced crystalloid can result in hyperchloremic acidosis, coagulopathy, and acute kidney injury.

### New criteria for sepsis-induced coagulopathy (SIC) following the revised sepsis definition: a retrospective analysis of a nationwide survey [^112VRHpu]. BMJ Open (2017). Medium credibility.

The clinical calculator "Sepsis-induced coagulopathy score (SIC score)" for sepsis and septic shock.

The Sepsis-induced Coagulopathy (SIC) score is a clinical calculator used in the management of patients with sepsis, a life-threatening condition caused by the body's response to an infection. The SIC score is specifically designed to identify patients with sepsis who have developed coagulopathy, a condition in which the blood's ability to clot is impaired. This can lead to an increased risk of bleeding or clotting complications.

The SIC score is calculated using three parameters: platelet count, prothrombin time, and the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score. A score of 4 or more indicates sepsis-induced coagulopathy.

The clinical utility of the SIC score is to help guide therapeutic decisions, particularly the use of anticoagulant therapy, in patients with sepsis. It can also be used to stratify risk and predict outcomes in these patients.

There are no specific exclusion criteria for the use of the SIC score, but it should be used with caution in patients with conditions that may independently affect coagulation, such as liver disease or anticoagulant therapy.

The Sepsis-induced Coagulopathy (SIC) score calculator evaluates data from three clinical parameters to assess the risk of 28-day mortality in sepsis patients. The input parameters are INR (International Normalized Ratio), platelet count (×10⁹/L), and the total SOFA (Sequential Organ Failure Assessment) score. Each parameter has predefined options that are assigned specific scores, which are then summed to generate a total SIC score indicative of the patient's mortality risk.

The scoring system for each parameter is as follows:

INR:
- ≤ 1.2 = 0 points
- 1.2–1.4 = 1 point
- > 1.4 = 2 points

Platelet count (×10⁹/L):
- ≥ 150 = 0 points
- 100–150 = 1 point
- < 100 = 2 points

Total SOFA score:

- 0 = 0 points
- 1 = 1 point
- ≥ 2 = 2 points

To calculate the total SIC score, the points assigned to each input parameter based on the user's scenario are summed. The resulting score ranges from 0 to 6, determining the associated risk of 28-day mortality.

The interpretation of the SIC score is as follows:

- A total score of 0 or 1 suggests a 0% risk of 28-day mortality.
- A total score of 2 indicates a 20% risk.
- A total score of 3 exhibits a 19% risk.
- A total score of 4 shows a 30% risk.
- A total score of 5 represents a 32% risk.
- A total score of 6 signifies a 46% risk.

### Consumptive coagulopathy is associated with a disturbed host response in patients with sepsis [^11181Lny]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

A prolonged prothrombin time (PT) is a common feature in sepsis indicating consumptive coagulopathy.

Objectives

To determine the association between a prolonged PT and aberrations in other host response mechanisms in sepsis.

Methods

Patients admitted to the intensive care unit with sepsis were divided in quartiles according to the highest PT value measured within 24 h after admission. The host response was evaluated by measuring 19 plasma biomarkers reflecting pathways implicated in sepsis pathogenesis and by blood leukocyte gene expression profiling.

Measurements and Main Results

Of 1524 admissions for sepsis, 386 (25.3%) involved patients with a normal PT (≤ 12.7 s); the remaining quartiles entailed 379 (24.9%) patients with a slightly prolonged PT (12.8 ≤ PT ≤ 15.0 s), 383 (25.1%) with an intermediately prolonged PT (15.1 ≤ PT ≤ 17.2 s), and 376 (24.7%) with an extremely prolonged PT (≥ 17.3 s). While patients with an extremely prolonged PT showed an increased crude mortality up to 1 year after admission, none of the prolonged PT groups was independently associated with 30-day adjusted mortality. Comparison of the host response between patients with a normal PT or an extremely prolonged PT matched for baseline characteristics including severity of disease showed that an extremely prolonged PT was associated with impaired anticoagulant mechanisms, a more disturbed endothelial barrier integrity and increased systemic inflammation, and blood leukocyte transcriptomes indicating more prominent metabolic reprogramming and protein catabolism.

Conclusion

A prolonged PT is associated with stronger anomalies in pathways implicated in the pathogenesis of sepsis, suggesting that activation of coagulation impacts other host response mechanisms.

### Coagulation abnormalities in critically ill patients [^1131J6p4]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

Many critically ill patients develop hemostatic abnormalities, ranging from isolated thrombocytopenia or prolonged global clotting tests to complex defects, such as disseminated intravascular coagulation. There are many causes for a deranged coagulation in critically ill patients and each of these underlying disorders may require specific therapeutic or supportive management. In recent years, new insights into the pathogenesis and clinical management of many coagulation defects in critically ill patients have been accumulated and this knowledge is helpful in determining the optimal diagnostic and therapeutic strategy.

### Inflammation, coagulopathy, and the pathogenesis of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome [^116i1Fze]. Critical Care Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

An improved understanding of the mechanisms through which infecting pathogens harm the host is leading to new formulations of the concept of sepsis. We review the roles of inflammation and coagulation in the pathogenesis of the multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, and explore the potential of new therapies to restore the fine biological balance between procoagulant and anticoagulant mechanisms that are disrupted during the life-threatening processes that lead to organ dysfunction.

Data Sources

Narrative review of published primary sources in the basic and clinical literature.

Data Summary

Traditional models of host-pathogen interactions ascribe the morbidity of infection to the direct cytotoxic effects of micro-organisms on host tissues. However, abundant experimental and clinical evidence has revealed that it is the response of the host, rather than the trigger that elicited it, that is the more potent determinant of outcome. The elucidation of a complex network of host-derived inflammatory mediators raised the possibility that targeting these individually could improve patient outcomes, and some modest successes with this approach have been achieved. More recently, it is becoming evident that the inflammatory response, in turn, mediates its deleterious effects by inducing tissue hypoxia, and cellular injury, either through tissue necrosis or through the induction of programmed cell death or apoptosis. Thus, treatment strategies that target the downstream consequences of the activation of inflammation, for example, microvascular coagulation or acute adrenal insufficiency, represent the latest, and some of the most promising approaches to attenuation of the septic response to improve survival, and minimize organ dysfunction. The maladaptive sequelae of systemic inflammation, embodied in the concept of the multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, comprise the leading obstacle to survival for patients admitted to a contemporary intensive care unit. Further insights into this intimidatingly complex process will not only provide potent new therapeutic options, but promise to transform critical illness from a biological standoff, during which the clinician merely supports failing organs, to a disease that can be successfully treated.

### Coagulopathy in COVID-19 [^116umT3X]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2020). Medium credibility.

The COVID-19 pandemic has become an urgent issue in every country. Based on recent reports, the most severely ill patients present with coagulopathy, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)-like massive intravascular clot formation is frequently seen in this cohort. Therefore, coagulation tests may be considered useful to discriminate severe cases of COVID-19. The clinical presentation of COVID-19-associated coagulopathy is organ dysfunction primarily, whereas hemorrhagic events are less frequent. Changes in hemostatic biomarkers represented by increase in D-dimer and fibrin/fibrinogen degradation products indicate the essence of coagulopathy is massive fibrin formation. In comparison with bacterial-sepsis-associated coagulopathy/DIC, prolongation of prothrombin time, and activated partial thromboplastin time, and decrease in antithrombin activity is less frequent and thrombocytopenia is relatively uncommon in COVID-19. The mechanisms of the coagulopathy are not fully elucidated, however. It is speculated that the dysregulated immune responses orchestrated by inflammatory cytokines, lymphocyte cell death, hypoxia, and endothelial damage are involved. Bleeding tendency is uncommon, but the incidence of thrombosis in COVID-19 and the adequacy of current recommendations regarding standard venous thromboembolic dosing are uncertain.

### The current status of viscoelastic testing in septic coagulopathy [^113suhnh]. Thrombosis Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Sepsis can be associated with different degrees of coagulopathy, ranging from a mild activation of the coagulation system to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The evaluation of haemostasis in the context of sepsis is important since it has been shown that anticoagulant therapies were beneficial mainly in patients with sepsis-induced DIC, but not in the general population of septic patients. Sepsis-induced haemostatic disturbances are not adequately reflected by standard coagulation tests (SCTs) which only consider the plasmatic components of the haemostatic system and not the cellular components. In addition, SCTs only assess the initiation phase of coagulation and reflect the activity of pro-coagulant factors, but lack sensitivity for the anticoagulant drive and the fibrinolytic activity. Viscoelastic tests (VET) are whole-blood tests which can assess clot formation and dissociation, and the contribution of both plasmatic and cellular components with a shorter turnaround time compared to SCTs. The use of VET in septic patients has proved useful for the assessment of the fibrinolytic activity, detecting hypercoagulable status and for the diagnosis of DIC and mortality risk prediction. While having relevant advantages over SCTs, the VET also present some blind spots or limitations leaving space for future improvement by the development of new reagents or new viscoelastic parameters.

### Sepsis-induced coagulopathy: a comprehensive narrative review of pathophysiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and management strategies [^117Gqdiq]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2024). Medium credibility.

The SIC score was designed for earlier identification of patients with coagulopathy who have an elevated risk of deterioration from nonovert to overt DIC, which explains its high sensitivity. Given that diagnosis of SIC using the SIC score preceded a diagnosis of overt DIC, once this patient subset is identified, they may be followed using the ISTH overt DIC score, which carries a higher specificity. A combination of the SIC score with the ISTH DIC score may allow for earlier detection of SIC and institution of therapy before progression to overt DIC.

### Enigmatic role of coagulopathy among sepsis survivors: a review of coagulation abnormalities and their possible link to chronic critical illness [^113e5zCt]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2020). Medium credibility.

Multiple scoring systems have attempted to standardize the diagnosis of DIC, but each has respective drawbacks, including broad applicability and questionable sensitivity. The most recent accepted diagnostic criteria are the ISTH overt DIC score, based on platelet counts, fibrin-related markers (D-dimer, and so on), PT and fibrinogen levels. This has been criticized for its detection of DIC in its later phases, and other guidelines have been proposed to diagnose DIC earlier in the disease course to better facilitate treatment, namely Japanese Association for Acute Medicine DIC score, and Japanese Society on Thrombosis and Hemostasis DIC.

Unfortunately, there are no current therapeutic interventions guaranteed to reverse DIC and the mainstay of treatment depends on resolving the underlying pathophysiologic process. Because coagulopathy and microthrombotic disease are believed to contribute to organ dysfunction during sepsis, numerous clinical trials have investigated whether coagulation mediators could be effective therapeutic targets. Notable mentions include the Protein C Worldwide Evaluation in Severe Sepsis (PROWESS) group, evaluating APC. APC is an endogenous protein that has both antithrombotic and profibrinolytic properties, and originally showed promise with a significant mortality reduction, particularly in patients with DIC. Other studies showed APC reduced overt thrombotic events, although with an increase in clinically significant bleeding events. After increasing doubt in the efficacy of APC, and higher concerns for bleeding, an investigation into the risk/benefit profile of the drug was called for. The study, PROWESS-SHOCK, eventually proved no difference in 28-day survival and the drug was discontinued.

### Enigmatic role of coagulopathy among sepsis survivors: a review of coagulation abnormalities and their possible link to chronic critical illness [^114u4P4P]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2020). Medium credibility.

Two European studies have advanced our understanding of long-term outcomes of infection and CCI. In a multicenter cohort study of hospitalized patients who survived community-acquired pneumonia, Yende et al determined that after adjusting for age, sex, race, and comorbidities, higher levels of TAT, PAI-1, and D-dimer within 96 hours of discharge were associated with greater all-cause 1-year mortality. This is consistent with the previously highlighted study showing that elevated TAT and PAI-1 levels at the time of sepsis diagnosis predict 28-day mortality. Even after adjusting for IL-6 levels, elevated TAT and D-dimer remained significantly associated with 1-year mortality, of which the most common cause was cardiovascular disease likely from destabilization of existing atherosclerotic plaques, cardiomyocyte depression, and/or plaque progression and rupture. Although these patients did not technically have sepsis, these findings illustrate that, even without a dysregulated systemic immune response, inflammation and coagulopathy can persist after the primary infection has resolved. Prospective observational data from Gayat et al echo these findings, demonstrating that markers of cardiovascular ischemia at the time of ICU discharge discriminate 1-year survivors from non-survivors. The authors also found that a platelet count < 100 000/µL at discharge was associated with a twofold increased risk of death 1 year after ICU admission. However, only one-fifth of included patients had septic shock as the reason of their ICU admission and additional coagulation markers were not specifically evaluated in this study. Together, these data suggest that persistence of abnormal hematologic markers at discharge is a warning sign and possible method for identifying patients vulnerable to later end-organ dysfunction and death. Further longitudinal research is needed to determine which particular serum markers, measurements, or trends predict worse outcomes for sepsis survivors. A summary of studies on coagulopathy among sepsis survivors is outlined in table 1.

### Causes and consequences of coagulation activation in sepsis: an evolutionary medicine perspective [^1112Q52Y]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Coagulation and innate immunity have been linked together for at least 450 million years of evolution. Sepsis, one of the world's leading causes of death, is probably the condition in which this evolutionary link is more evident. However, the biological and the clinical relevance of this association have only recently gained the attention of the scientific community.

Discussion

During sepsis, the host response to a pathogen is invariably associated with coagulation activation. For several years, coagulation activation has been solely regarded as a mechanism of tissue damage, a concept that led to several clinical trials of anticoagulant agents for sepsis. More recently, this paradigm has been challenged by the failure of these clinical trials, and by a growing bulk of evidence supporting the concept that coagulation activation is beneficial for pathogen clearance. In this article we discuss recent basic and clinical data that point to a more balanced view of the detrimental and beneficial consequences of coagulation activation in sepsis. Reappraisal of the association between coagulation and immune activation from an evolutionary medicine perspective offers a unique opportunity to gain new insights about the pathogenesis of sepsis, paving the way to more successful approaches in both basic and clinical research in this field.

### Mechanisms and management of the coagulopathy of trauma and sepsis: trauma-induced coagulopathy, sepsis-induced coagulopathy, and disseminated intravascular coagulation [^114FoiWh]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2023). Medium credibility.

Disseminated intravascular coagulation can occur due to different causes but commonly following sepsis. Trauma-induced coagulopathy (TIC) occurs on hospital arrival in approximately 25% of seriously injured patients who initially presents with impaired hemostasis and a bleeding phenotype that can later progress to a prothrombotic phase. Following traumatic injury, ineffective hemostasis is driven by massive blood loss, tissue damage, and hyperfibrinolysis. This initial impaired hemostasis continues until surgical or other management strategies not only to stop the causes of hemorrhage but also progresses to a prothrombotic and hypofibrinolytic state, also termed fibrinolytic shutdown. Prothrombotic progression is also promoted by inflammatory mediator release, endothelial injury, and platelet dysregulation, which is commonly seen in sepsis with increased mortality. Unlike TIC, the early phase of sepsis is frequently complicated by multiorgan dysfunction described as sepsis-induced coagulopathy (SIC) that lacks a hemorrhagic phase. The phenotypes of SIC and TIC are different, especially in their initial presentations; however, patients who survive TIC may also develop subsequent infections and potentially sepsis and SIC. Although the pathophysiology of SIC and TIC are different, endothelial injury, dysregulated fibrinolysis, and coagulation abnormalities are common. Management includes treatment of the underlying cause, tissue injury vs infection is critical, and supportive therapies, such as hemostatic resuscitation and circulatory support are essential, and adjunct therapies are recommended in guidelines. Based on clinical studies and certain guidelines, additional therapies include tranexamic acid in the limited timing of initial traumatic injury and anticoagulants, such as antithrombin and recombinant thrombomodulin in disseminated intravascular coagulation.

Coagulopathy is a severe and frequent complication in critically ill patients, for which the pathogenesis and presentation may be variable depending on the underlying disease. Based on the dominant clinical phenotype, the current review differentiates between hemorrhagic coagulopathies, characterized by a hypocoagulable and hyperfibrinolysis state, and thrombotic coagulopathies with a systemic prothrombotic and antifibrinolytic phenotype. We discuss the differences in pathogenesis and treatment of the common coagulopathies.

### Utility of thromboelastography and / or thromboelastometry in adults with sepsis: a systematic review [^115SPrR5]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Coagulation abnormalities are frequent in sepsis. Conventional coagulation assays, however, have several limitations. A surge of interest exists in the use of point-of-care tests to diagnose hypo- and hypercoagulability in sepsis.

Methods

MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library were searched from 1 January 1980 to 31 December 2012. The search was limited to adults, and language was limited to English. Reference lists of retrieved articles were hand-searched for additional studies. Ongoing trials were searched on http://www.controlled-trials.com and http://www.clinicaltrials.gov. Studies addressing TEG/ROTEM measurements in adult patients with sepsis admitted to the ICU were considered eligible.

Results

Of 680 screened articles, 18 studies were included, of which two were randomized controlled trials, and 16 were observational cohort studies. In patients with sepsis, results show both hyper- and hypocoagulability, as well as TEG/ROTEM values that fell within reference values. Both hyper- and hypocoagulability were to some extent associated with diffuse intravascular coagulation. Compared with conventional coagulation tests, TEG/ROTEM can detect impaired fibrinolysis, which can possibly help to discriminate between sepsis and systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). A hypocoagulable profile is associated with increased mortality. The value of TEG/ROTEM to identify patients with sepsis who could possibly benefit from therapies interfering with the coagulation system could not be assessed, because studies addressing this topic were limited.

Conclusion

TEG/ROTEM could be a promising tool in diagnosing alterations in coagulation in sepsis. Further research on the value of TEG/ROTEM in these patients is warranted. Given that coagulopathy is a dynamic process, sequential measurements are needed to understand the coagulation patterns in sepsis, as can be detected by TEG/ROTEM.

Introduction

Coagulation abnormalities are frequent in sepsis. Conventional coagulation assays, however, have several limitations. A surge of interest exists in the use of point-of-care tests to diagnose hypo- and hypercoagulability in sepsis.

We performed a systematic review of available literature to establish the value of rotational thromboelastography (TEG) and thromboelastometry (ROTEM) compared with standard coagulation tests to detect hyper- or hypocoagulability in sepsis patients. Furthermore, we assessed the value of TEG/ROTEM to identify sepsis patients likely to benefit from therapies that interfere with the coagulation system.

Key messages

- Key thromboelastometric variables remained within reference ranges during the course of critically illness in patients with sepsis without adverse bleeding events.

- After resolution of the critical illness in patients with severe sepsis/septic shock, thromboelastometric variables exhibited shortened coagulation time, accelerated clot formation, and increased firmness of the formed blood clot when compared with values on admission. With increased severity of illness, these changes were more pronounced.

- Thromboelastometry, when performed in patients with established severe sepsis and septic shock, cannot reliably detect activation of coagulation in the sense of a hypercoagulable state, as suggested by in vitro or experimental studies.

### Utility of thromboelastography and / or thromboelastometry in adults with sepsis: a systematic review [^111XGwRF]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Coagulopathy is highly prevalent in sepsis patients and is associated with increased mortality. Coagulopathy results from an imbalance between activation of coagulation and impaired inhibition of coagulation and fibrinolysis. The disturbance between components of the coagulation system leads to a variable clinical picture, ranging from an increased bleeding tendency due to consumption of coagulation factors and platelets, to hypercoagulopathy with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and (micro-) vascular thrombosis.

Assessment of coagulation status in these patients is complex. Global coagulation tests activating partial thromboplastin time (APTT) and prothrombin time (PT) are used clinically. However, their ability to reflect in vivo hypocoagulability accurately is questioned. Also, APTT and PT reflect only a part of the coagulation system and do not provide information on the full balance between coagulation and anticoagulation. Activation of coagulation can be assessed by thrombin generation, but this test is not widely available. Impaired function of the anticoagulant system can be diagnosed by measuring plasma levels of naturally occurring anticoagulant factors antithrombin (AT), protein C, protein S, and tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI). However, these are not readily available for clinical use. The same applies to markers of the activity of the fibrinolytic system. Although activation of the fibrinolytic system can be detected by increased levels of D-dimers and other fibrin-degradation products, specificity is limited.

Coagulation Testing in SIC

Diagnostic criteria for SIC do not include evaluation of endogenous anticoagulants, the fibrinolytic-antifibrinolytic system, inflammation, or endothelial activation. Recent work has identified new metrics for SIC, including markers of inflammation (eg, vascular endothelial growth factor and IL-6:IL-10 ratio), infection (eg, procalcitonin), endothelial function (eg, endocan), and platelet activation (eg, platelet factor-4), which have strong predictive ability for mortality (AUC, 0.87). An experimental scoring system including plasma levels of EC-derived microparticles, platelet count, and PT demonstrated a negative predictive value for DIC of 93% at admission, allowing early stratification of coagulopathy risk development in septic patients. Such markers may provide more precise characterization, but have not been widely validated to distinguish SIC from other forms of DIC, nor are they readily available for routine testing. Therefore, no recommendations currently exist for routine measurements beyond standard coagulation testing.

Thromboelastography (TEG) or rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) may be useful as a diagnostic screen in SIC; however, a majority of studies focus on capturing overt DIC. Patients with overt DIC had reduced maximum clot firmness (MCF) on ROTEM compared to those without DIC, and MCF demonstrated a high sensitivity for DIC diagnosis. A 2021 meta-analysis evaluated 11 observational studies using TEG or ROTEM, and found that a hypocoaguable profile (reduced MCF) was a valid parameter associated with mortality in septic patients.MCF is strongly dependent on platelets and fibrinogen, and reduced MCF suggests reductions in both secondary to ongoing activation and consumption. In a cohort of 295 patients with SIC, 30% progressed to DIC within 3 days of admission, and an initial MCF value on TEG < 64 mm was proven to be an independent risk factor for DIC development. However, the range of reported MCF values in patients that developed DIC was 52.2 to 67.6 mm (vs 60.2–73.4 mm in non-DIC, P < .001), showing that although reduced, TEG/ROTEM values often remain within established reference ranges. Whether TEG/ROTEM is sensitive enough to detect early changes in coagulation characteristic of SIC is unclear, and this highlights the need for additional clinical research into determining viscoelastic reference ranges for SIC across multiple time points to capture dynamic changes in coagulation and establish appropriate reference ranges.

### Utility of thromboelastography and / or thromboelastometry in adults with sepsis: a systematic review [^111mBthn]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusion

A considerable proportion of sepsis patients have an altered coagulation status. An abnormal TEG/ROTEM, in particular hypocoagulability, is prognostic for mortality in the critically ill. Also, hypocoagulability as detected by TEG/ROTEM may aid in diagnosing DIC and hypofibrinolysis. Despite heterogeneity and the limited quality of most included studies, application of TEG/ROTEM seems a promising tool in sepsis. However, given that coagulopathy is a dynamic process, more insight into the kinetics of the coagulation alterations, as diagnosed by TEG/ROTEM, is needed before the general use of TEG/ROTEM to detect hyper- or hypocoagulability and DIC can be advocated.

### A scoping review on pediatric sepsis prediction technologies in healthcare [^115g43su]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

In the few models with a severe sepsis endpoint, none included laboratory values as predictive features. While severe sepsis is often referred to as organ dysfunction (i.e. cardiovascular or respiratory or two other organ system dysfunctions) in addition to a sepsis diagnosis, laboratory values for sepsis may already be confirmed before these models are intended for use. The utility of a severe sepsis model may be for identifying deterioration and increasingly abnormal organ dysfunction beyond an initial sepsis diagnosis. However, the term "severe sepsis" has been recently noted as redundant to sepsis and septic shock in the latest international consensus criteria, suggesting that future model development should focus on the newest sepsis and septic shock definitions.

In contrast, laboratory values were the top two predictive features for septic shock models. Serum lactate emerged as the highest-ranking individual feature on the basis of median values, followed by platelet count. Lactate is a clinical indicator for hemodynamic instability in children and, if infected, indicates a greater risk of multiorgan dysfunction syndrome and mortality. Lactate is also included in the latest pediatric septic shock criteria. Yet, controversy surrounds this measurement as it may not always be available in lower-resource settings, and children with normal lactate levels are not necessarily excluded from a sepsis diagnosis. Low platelet counts are most clearly understood in the pediatric sepsis literature as a "consumptive coagulopathy" leading to simultaneously increased bleeding and clotting. Other research suggests that low platelet counts may also be a good predictor of 28-day mortality from septic shock children. However, similar to lactate, acquiring platelet counts in all settings may not be possible. Scoring tools with built-in redundancies if laboratory values are unavailable — or models that do not rely on laboratory values — may have greater utility and practicality in lower-resource environments, and this consideration for resiliency in response to resource availability should be emphasized in future model development.

### Combination of thrombin-antithrombin complex, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, and protein C activity for early identification of severe coagulopathy in initial phase of sepsis: a prospective observational study [^116NN3cg]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Sepsis is frequently complicated with coagulopathy. The severity of sepsis-associated coagulopathy is variable, ranging from subclinical abnormalities that are detectable by a mild decrease in platelet count and prolongation of global clotting times, to severe forms of coagulopathy or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The incidence of DIC is up to 25 to 50% in patients with sepsis.

Septic DIC is characterized by systemic intravascular activation of coagulation, and microvascular endothelial injury with impaired anticoagulation and insufficient fibrinolysis, which leads to widespread thrombosis in microvasculature. In sepsis, DIC has a feature of vascular endothelial dysfunction, as well as being an etiological factor in the failure of other organs: excessive thrombin generation and subsequent fibrin deposition exacerbate inflammation and ischemia, contributing to organ damage. A number of studies have reported that DIC is an independent risk factor for organ dysfunction and mortality in patients with sepsis. DIC might, therefore, be an important therapeutic target in the management of sepsis, and the development of reliable methods for early identification of DIC is a high priority.

However, the early diagnosis of sepsis-associated coagulopathy and evaluation of its severity is still challenging. Currently, the overt DIC criteria of the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) are the diagnostic standard for severe coagulopathy in sepsis. Although the ISTH criteria for overt DIC are simple and widely used, and shown to be associated with organ failure and mortality, they have limited application in the early phase of sepsis to improve outcome. The ISTH overt DIC criteria use global markers, such as prothrombin time (PT) and platelet count for scoring. The coagulation factors and platelets are consumed and decrease over time because of progressive thrombin generation and endothelial injury, thus it takes several days to reveal their abnormalities and fulfill the overt DIC criteria in the course of sepsis. Furthermore, introduction of the concept of pre-DIC, which is considered as the stage prior to overt DIC, has failed to predict disease progression. An ISTH subcommittee defined non-overt DIC as compensated coagulopathy, or pre-stage DIC, for the early diagnosis of overt DIC. However, previous studies have shown that only 10 to 30% of patients with non-overt DIC progressed to overt DIC, although the mortality rates were similar between patients with non-overt and overt DIC.

CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS OF SIC

Diagnostic Scoring Systems

Multiple scoring systems exist to diagnose coagulopathy during sepsis. As detailed in Table 2, most use a point system to weigh the impact of changes in plasma coagulation parameters such as prothrombin time (PT), fibrinogen, fibrinogen degradation products (FDP), and platelet count. The Japanese Association for Acute Medicine (JAAM) guidelines are similar to the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) DIC score but omit fibrinogen levels and include an additional point for the presence of systemic inflammatory response syndrome. The JAAM score has a high sensitivity for DIC in patients with infection, while the ISTH-DIC criteria demonstrate greater specificity. Sepsis and its associated dynamic coagulation abnormalities, however, spawned modifications in both the JAAMand ISTH (mISTH) scores to aid in earlier identification of patients with SIC. The mISTH score, for instance, removes fibrinogen from the measurement, as fibrinogen levels do not aid in SIC diagnosis and do not affect early outcome prediction.

Table 2.
Diagnostic Scoring Systems Used in Diagnosis of Coagulopathy in Sepsis

The ISTH further adopted an additional screening tool, the SIC score (Table 2), which demonstrates a strong predictive value for 28-day mortality in patients with SIC. Because early sepsis is characterized by high PAI-1 levels and suppression of fibrinolysis with normal fibrinogen, the SIC score is targeted at nonovert DIC and does not include fibrinogen and FDP/d-dimer levels. In a retrospective review of septic patients in 2017, fibrinogen/FDP levels did not differ between SIC survivors and nonsurvivors and therefore may not be relevant for early discrimination. Both the mISTH and SIC scores are independently associated with disease severity and ICU mortality, but the mISTH score better predicts ICU mortality compared to the SIC score (mISTH, area under the curve [AUC], 0.684 vs SIC, 0.658).SIC score has a higher sensitivity (74.3%) compared to mISTH (49.5%), but lacks specificity, in part because the SIC score includes 3 parameters, 1 of which is the sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) value, which is elevated given the current Sepsis-3 diagnostic guidelines.

Explainability analysis of coagulation-inflammatory dysfunction

The 35 laboratory measurements collectively capture multi-organ dysfunction spanning five categories: coagulation-inflammatory, hepatic, renal, blood gas, and oxygen transport (Erythrocyte), while essentially conforming to the connotation of Sepsis-3 criteria (excluding neurological markers). However, their full clinical adoption is hindered by prohibitive costs, large blood volume requirements, and implementation barriers in resource-constrained settings. To overcome these challenges, explainability analyses were performed across five categories to achieve two clinical goals: (a) select an efficient unsupervised clustering method to uncover clinically meaningful sepsis subphenotypes, essential for understanding disease heterogeneity and guiding clinical insights; (b) identify a sepsis mechanism relevant and clinically feasible subset of laboratory measurements within one category for real-time and cost-effective application.

We explained the effectiveness of coagulation-inflammatory markers in predicting sepsis outcomes through multi-view explainability analyses of cluster-informed EHR variables, model, and transcriptomics. We identified coagulation-inflammation-related variables that are essential for sepsis subtyping. Exploratory clusters α and β were automatically derived using unsupervised clustering methods using 36 sepsis predictors, requiring no prior information (e.g. mortality, disease outcomes, or treatment medications), based on the optimal number of clusters (Supplementary Table 4). Five different unsupervised methods — Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), MiniBatchKMeans, K-means, Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering (HAC), and Birch — generated highly aligned clusters, a consistency across distinct approaches that confirms the robustness and validity of the two identified clusters. Since these data-driven clusters lack inherent clinical interpretation, we statistically analyzed subgroup mortality. The GMM-derived α and β clusters exhibited the most significant mortality difference (32.09% vs 17.62%, respectively), indicating GMM's superior effectiveness in identifying patient subgroups with divergent mortality risks. In the chord diagram, both cluster α and cluster β consistently showed the widest chords with the coagulation-inflammatory category (ribbons connect with these portions of the circle), indicating coagulation-inflammatory predictors are key defining features for the clustering. Independently, the radar plot also confirmed the coagulation-inflammatory category as the highest connection point. These findings were robustly replicated across all five unsupervised clustering methods (Fig. 2f and Supplementary Fig. 3).

The technique was developed in the 1940s, but clinical application has been limited. However, technical developments have led to standardization and improved reproducibility of the method. TEG/ROTEM may facilitate diagnosis of clotting abnormalities in sepsis, including hypercoagulable states such as DIC. Other potential advantages could be a more tailor-made administration of therapies that interfere with the coagulation system. These tests also may improve prognostication of sepsis.

The main research questions for this systemic review were as follows. Can TEG/ROTEM detect sepsis-induced coagulopathy? Is TEG/ROTEM of additional value compared with standard coagulation tests to detect hyper- or hypocoagulability in sepsis patients? Can TEG/ROTEM help to identify sepsis patients likely to benefit from therapies that interfere with the coagulation system (for example, activated protein C, antithrombin, heparin)? We defined our population as critically ill adults with sepsis and TEG/ROTEM as the intervention. Standard coagulation tests, including APTT, PT, INR, and ISTH DIC score, functioned as comparisons. Outcomes of interest were the detection of a hyper- or hypocoagulable state in these patients and the identification of patients likely to benefit from therapies affecting the coagulation system.

DISCUSSION

Coagulopathy is prevalent in patients with sepsis and likely plays a key role in multiple organ dysfunction. SAC is correlated with an increased risk of mortality and is defined by a prolonged PT-INR and reduced platelet count. In this post hoc analysis, patients in the SCARLET trial were sorted by the baseline values of coagulation biomarkers (≤ upper limit, > upper limit, ≥ 1.5-fold upper limit, ≥ two-fold upper limit, and ≥ 2.5-fold upper limit), referring to the new JSTH DIC criteria, which include values of F1.2 or TAT. The upper limits of normal range were based on values from the package inserts for each of the three coagulation biomarkers. Findings from this post hoc analysis show that mortality rates steadily increased, with increasing levels of baseline thrombin generation markers, F1.2 and TAT, in the placebo group (Fig. 1). However, except for the group with F1.2 and TAT levels at or below the upper limit of normal, the increases in the 28-day all-cause mortality rates in the ART-123 group were lower or negligible with increasing baseline F1.2 and TAT levels. Consequently, ARRs were greater in the subgroups with higher baseline F1.2 or TAT levels. These results are consistent with the known anticoagulant effects of ART-123 exerted by binding with thrombin and modifying thrombin activity. The discrepancies between the observations with F1.2 or TAT levels and-dimer levels are possibly due to F1.2 and TAT being pure markers of thrombin generation, whereas-dimer is a marker of fibrin degradation (fibrinolysis). These-dimer data may be a reflection of the impaired fibrinolysis known to occur in sepsis due to elevated levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), which inhibits plasmin formation and subsequently the degradation of fibrin. High levels of PAI-1 are correlated with the severity of sepsis and are associated with increased mortality. The higher levels of PAI-1 in patients with severe sepsis could have affected the relationship between mortality and-dimer levels in this analysis. In the previous post hoc analyses, 28-day all-cause mortality rates in the subgroup of patients who maintained the protocol-specified coagulopathy criteria at baseline (after randomization and before the first dose of study drug; n = 634, PT-INR > 1.40 and platelet count > 30 × 10⁹/L) were 26.7% (82/307) with ART-123 and 32.1% (105/327) with placebo — a difference of 5.40% (95% CI, –1.7% to 12.5%), exceeding the 2.55% ARR of the FAS (p = 0.32). This post hoc analysis shows the mortality data for ART-123–treated patients with SAC and higher coagulation markers (F1.2, TAT, and-dimer). The ARRs of these subgroups increased with higher baseline levels of thrombin generation biomarkers.

### Universal changes in biomarkers of coagulation and inflammation occur in patients with severe sepsis, regardless of causative micro-organism [^113c7Y4C]. Critical Care (2004). Low credibility.

Introduction

PROWESS (Recombinant Human Activated Protein C Worldwide Evaluation in Severe Sepsis) was a phase III, randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, multicenter trial conducted in patients with severe sepsis from 164 medical centers. Here we report data collected at study entry for 1690 patients and over the following 7 days for the 840 patients who received placebo (in addition to usual standard of care).

Methods

Nineteen biomarkers of coagulation activation, anticoagulation, fibrinolysis, endothelial injury, and inflammation were analyzed to determine the relationships between baseline values and their change over time, with 28-day survival, and type of infecting causative micro-organism.

Results

Levels of 13 of the 19 biomarkers at baseline correlated with Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II scores, and nearly all patients exhibited coagulopathy, endothelial injury, and inflammation at baseline. At study entry, elevated D-dimer, thrombin-antithrombin complexes, IL-6, and prolonged prothrombin time were present in 99.7%, 95.5%, 98.5%, and 93.4% of patients, respectively. Markers of endothelial injury (soluble thrombomodulin) and deficient protein C, protein S, and antithrombin were apparent in 72%, 87.6%, 77.8%, and 81.7%, respectively. Impaired fibrinolysis (elevated plasminogen activator inhibitor-1) was observed in 44% of patients. During the first 7 days, increased prothrombin time (which is readily measurable in most clinical settings) was highly evident among patients who were not alive at 28 days.

Conclusion

Abnormalities in biomarkers of inflammation and coagulation were related to disease severity and mortality outcome in patients with severe sepsis. Coagulopathy and inflammation were universal host responses to infection in patients with severe sepsis, which were similar across causative micro-organism groups.

### Consumptive coagulopathy is associated with a disturbed host response in patients with sepsis [^111EGUy1]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2021). Medium credibility.

We previously reported on the association between platelet counts and mortality in the same cohort. 8 In this earlier publication the older Sepsis‐2 definition was used to identify patients with sepsis. 8, 25 Because in the current article the Sepsis‐3 definition was used, we determined whether the findings of our previous article could be confirmed in the present sepsis group and assessed the crude association between platelet counts and mortality. To do so, patients were stratified into clinically relevant subgroups of platelet counts on admission to the ICU as described in our previously published paper 8: very low < 50 × 10⁹/L, intermediate‐low 50–99 × 10⁹/L, low 100–149 × 10⁹/L, or normal 150–399 × 10⁹/L. Patients with thrombocytosis (≥ 400 × 10⁹/L; n = 145) or unknown platelet counts in the first 24 h after ICU admission (n = 4) were excluded. Consistent with our previous publication, 8 mortality was highest in patients with very low platelet counts (n = 133); 34.6% for ICU mortality compared to 24.4% in patients with intermediate‐low platelet counts (n = 156), 12.6% in patients with low platelet counts (n = 230), and 11.3% in patients with normal platelet counts (n = 856; overall p < .001). The same was true for 30‐day mortality, which was highest in patients with very low platelet counts, 44.9% versus 30.0% in patients with intermediate‐low platelet counts; 18.6% in patients with low platelet counts, and 19.1% in patients with normal platelet counts (overall p < .001).

### COVID-19 and its implications for thrombosis and anticoagulation [^111Yv3ze]. Blood (2020). Medium credibility.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-induced infection can be associated with a coagulopathy, findings consistent with infection-induced inflammatory changes as observed in patients with disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC). The lack of prior immunity to COVID-19 has resulted in large numbers of infected patients across the globe and uncertainty regarding management of the complications that arise in the course of this viral illness. The lungs are the target organ for COVID-19; patients develop acute lung injury that can progress to respiratory failure, although multiorgan failure can also occur. The initial coagulopathy of COVID-19 presents with prominent elevation of D-dimer and fibrin/fibrinogen-degradation products, whereas abnormalities in prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, and platelet counts are relatively uncommon in initial presentations. Coagulation test screening, including the measurement of D-dimer and fibrinogen levels, is suggested. COVID-19-associated coagulopathy should be managed as it would be for any critically ill patient, following the established practice of using thromboembolic prophylaxis for critically ill hospitalized patients, and standard supportive care measures for those with sepsis-induced coagulopathy or DIC. Although D-dimer, sepsis physiology, and consumptive coagulopathy are indicators of mortality, current data do not suggest the use of full-intensity anticoagulation doses unless otherwise clinically indicated. Even though there is an associated coagulopathy with COVID-19, bleeding manifestations, even in those with DIC, have not been reported. If bleeding does occur, standard guidelines for the management of DIC and bleeding should be followed.

Role of Thromboelastography in Septic ShockClinicalTrials. gov ID Study Overview Coagulation dysfunction is frequent in septic patients and it is associated with an increase risk of mortality. During sepsis platelets number usually decreases and their function is reduced and this mechanism is sustained by an inflammatory induced coagulopathy. Some recent studies evaluated the possibility to use viscoelastic whole blood tests of the haemostasis, such as thromboelastography, which analyze all blood components and their interactions during clot formation and dissolution and might be useful for assessing bleeding risk in septic patients. Secondary end points: to evaluate whether a different level of MA correlates with the biomarker of the severity of sepsis such as presepsin, with the biomarker of the severity of infection and whether a pattern of hypocoagulability might be associated with a risk of mortality.

All enrolled patients will undergo a blood sample at admission, after 72 hours and after 7 days and all the following parameters will be measured: Outcome measurements: Intensive Care Unit Length of Stay and mortality at 28 days and at 90 days. Introduction Coagulation dysfunction is frequent in patients with severe sepsis and it is associated with an increase risk of mortality. During sepsis platelets number usually decreases and their function is reduced and this mechanism is sustained by an inflammatory induced coagulopathy. Several studies have showed a correlation between altered function of platelets and sepsis severity. A more recent study identified a possible hypocoagulability pattern among septic patients at risk of bleeding using TEG variable and the authors found a strong correlation with increased risk of death.

Maximun amplitude is one of the variables obtained from TEG analysis and it expresses the strength of the clot and the efficacy of platelet function. A low level of MA describes a lower strength of the clot determined by a lower number or a reduced function of platelet. In one recent study it has been described that a lower MA describing a hypocoagulability pattern might be associated with an increased risk of death. The aim of the present study is to evaluate whether a lower level of MA and a pattern of hypocoagulability might be associated with an increased risk of bleeding and need of transfusion in patients with sepsis. Methods A prospective multicenter observational study will be conducted in five intensive care units of five Italian university hospitals. We asked for Ethic Committee approval.

The plasma contact system, consisting of kallikrein-kinin, high-molecular-weight kininogen (HMWK), and FXII, further propagates thrombin generation.FXII is the primary initiator of this system and plays a role in pathological thrombus formation. FXII circulates as a free zymogen capable of autoactivation to FXIIa after contact with negatively charged surfaces. After activation, FXIIa proteolytically cleaves prekallikrein to kallikrein, which can further activate FXII to FXIIa in a positive feedback reaction. FXIIa, as a serine protease, can subsequently mediate additional cleavage of FIX to FIXa, and further propagate thrombin generation.

### Effect of a recombinant human soluble thrombomodulin on baseline coagulation biomarker levels and mortality outcome in patients with sepsis-associated coagulopathy [^114udfba]. Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To assess the effects of recombinant human soluble thrombomodulin treatment on 28-day all-cause mortality in subgroups categorized by baseline coagulation biomarker levels (prothrombin fragment 1.2, thrombin-antithrombin complex, D-dimer) in patients with sepsis-associated coagulopathy in the Sepsis Coagulopathy Asahi Recombinant LE Thrombomodulin trial (SCARLET) (NCT01598831).

Design

Post hoc, subgroup analysis of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multinational, multicenter phase 3 study.

Setting

ICUs at 159 sites in 26 countries.

Patients

Eight-hundred adults with sepsis-associated coagulopathy defined as international normalized ratio greater than 1.40 and platelet count between 30 × 10⁹/L and 150 × 10⁹/L or greater than 30% decrease within 24 hours with concomitant cardiovascular and/or respiratory failure.

Interventions

Patients randomized and treated with recombinant human soluble thrombomodulin (0.06 mg/kg/d; n = 395) or equivalent placebo (n = 405) for 6 days.

Measurements and Main Results

Recombinant human soluble thrombomodulin did not significantly reduce 28-day all-cause mortality in the Sepsis Coagulopathy Asahi Recombinant LE Thrombomodulin trial: absolute risk reduction was 2.55% (p = 0.32) in patients with sepsis-associated coagulopathy. In this post hoc analysis, mortality steadily increased with increasing baseline prothrombin fragment 1.2 and thrombin-antithrombin complex levels in the placebo group; for those values exceeding the upper limit of normal, the mortality increases in the recombinant human soluble thrombomodulin group were lower or negligible with increasing baseline prothrombin fragment 1.2 and thrombin-antithrombin complex. Consequently, absolute risk reductions were greater in subgroups with higher baseline prothrombin fragment 1.2 or thrombin-antithrombin complex. Absolute risk reductions were also greater in subgroups with baseline coagulation biomarker levels at or above median of the entire study population, ranging from 4.2% (95% CI, -5.0% to 13.4%) to 5.5% (95% CI, -4.0% to 14.9%).

Conclusions

Compared with patients receiving placebo, patients treated with recombinant human soluble thrombomodulin having higher baseline thrombin generation biomarker levels had lower mortality.

### Combination of thrombin-antithrombin complex, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, and protein C activity for early identification of severe coagulopathy in initial phase of sepsis: a prospective observational study [^113hYeQJ]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

The main findings of our study were as follows. 1) Coagulopathy developed in the initial phase of sepsis, and the severity of hemostatic biomarker abnormalities on the day of admission was associated with the subsequent development of overt DIC. 2) Among all the studied biomarkers, TAT, PAI-1 and PC had the best discriminative power for the patients who newly developed overt DIC. 3) However, only TAT and PAI-1 on Day 0 were significant predictors of 28-day mortality among the diagnostic biomarkers for the development of overt DIC. In contrast, Day 2 markers had higher predictive power for 28-day mortality compared with Day 0 markers, suggesting that persistence of severe coagulopathy was correlated with mortality.

Inflammation and coagulation constitute two host defense systems with complementary roles against infection, which means that an overwhelming systemic inflammatory reaction in sepsis is accompanied by severe coagulopathy, and both may contribute to tissue damage in the early phase of sepsis. In our study, most patients with sepsis exhibited coagulation and fibrinolytic abnormalities at the time of ICU admission, which is consistent with the data from the PROWESS trial. In addition, most hemostatic biomarkers measured on ICU admission were associated with subsequent fulfillment of overt DIC criteria. These results support the hypothesis that coagulopathy is present in the initial phase of sepsis, and the strategy to identify markers of acute ongoing coagulopathy, rather than to detect pre-DIC state, may be necessary for the early diagnosis of septic DIC.

The pathogenesis of DIC is primarily due to excess production of thrombin. In sepsis, anticoagulation impairment and insufficient fibrinolysis also contribute to thrombin generation and fibrin deposition. Anticoagulation pathways such as the antithrombin and protein C systems are impaired because of increased consumption, decreased protein synthesis, extravasation and degradation by several proteolytic enzymes such as neutrophil elastase. The fibrinolytic system is largely suppressed by increased production of PAI-1, which is a principal inhibitor of this system. In our study, increased levels of TAT and PAI-1, and decreased PC activity, were observed at the time of ICU admission and each independently discriminated the patients who developed overt DIC from those who did not. Our findings indicate that activation of coagulation, anticoagulation impairment and insufficient fibrinolysis develop early in the course of sepsis, and these three mechanisms should be evaluated individually for the diagnosis of DIC in patients with sepsis.

### Clinical and laboratory effects of recombinant human activated protein C in the treatment of a patient with sepsis-induced multiple organ failure [^115DyJjH]. Thrombosis Research (2003). Low credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate clinical and laboratory effects of the administration of recombinant human activated protein C (rhAPC) in the treatment of a 25-year-old patient with septic shock and multiple organ failure secondary to perinephritic abscesses.

Interventions

Intravenous administration of rhAPC-or drotrecogin alfa (activated)-(24 mcg/kg/h) for a total of 80 h as an adjunct to antimicrobial therapy, mechanical ventilation, hemodynamic support, hemodiafiltration and surgical intervention.

Measurements and Main Results

The administration of rhAPC was associated with a rapid recovery of the patient's clinical condition reflected by decreasing Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores. Laboratory parameters monitoring inflammation and coagulopathy improved during the treatment. No drug-related adverse events were noted.

Conclusions

RhAPC has been observed to have anticoagulant, anti-inflammatory and profibrinolytic properties in vitro and in vivo. This report describes the effects of rhAPC administration on standard laboratory parameters indicating that no single laboratory parameter exists that is capable of monitoring the effects of rhAPC on the coagulation cascade and the clinical course of sepsis. This description of a patient suffering from sepsis-induced multiple organ failure may illustrate a possible beneficial effect of rhAPC on the course of coagulopathy and systemic inflammatory response and provides evidence for rhAPC complementing standard intensive care therapy in severe sepsis.

### Effect of a recombinant human soluble thrombomodulin on baseline coagulation biomarker levels and mortality outcome in patients with sepsis-associated coagulopathy [^115TBGnm]. Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives:

To assess the effects of recombinant human soluble thrombomodulin treatment on 28-day all-cause mortality in subgroups categorized by baseline coagulation biomarker levels (prothrombin fragment 1.2, thrombin-antithrombin complex,-dimer) in patients with sepsis-associated coagulopathy in the Sepsis Coagulopathy Asahi Recombinant LE Thrombomodulin trial (SCARLET) (NCT01598831).

Design:

Post hoc, subgroup analysis of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multinational, multicenter phase 3 study.

Setting:

ICUs at 159 sites in 26 countries.

Patients:

Eight-hundred adults with sepsis-associated coagulopathy defined as international normalized ratio greater than 1.40 and platelet count between 30 × 10⁹/L and 150 × 10⁹/L or greater than 30% decrease within 24 hours with concomitant cardiovascular and/or respiratory failure.

Interventions:

Patients randomized and treated with recombinant human soluble thrombomodulin (0.06 mg/kg/d; n = 395) or equivalent placebo (n = 405) for 6 days.

Measurements and Main Results:

Recombinant human soluble thrombomodulin did not significantly reduce 28-day all-cause mortality in the Sepsis Coagulopathy Asahi Recombinant LE Thrombomodulin trial: absolute risk reduction was 2.55% (p = 0.32) in patients with sepsis-associated coagulopathy. In this post hoc analysis, mortality steadily increased with increasing baseline prothrombin fragment 1.2 and thrombin-antithrombin complex levels in the placebo group; for those values exceeding the upper limit of normal, the mortality increases in the recombinant human soluble thrombomodulin group were lower or negligible with increasing baseline prothrombin fragment 1.2 and thrombin-antithrombin complex. Consequently, absolute risk reductions were greater in subgroups with higher baseline prothrombin fragment 1.2 or thrombin-antithrombin complex. Absolute risk reductions were also greater in subgroups with baseline coagulation biomarker levels at or above median of the entire study population, ranging from 4.2% (95% CI, –5.0% to 13.4%) to 5.5% (95% CI, –4.0% to 14.9%).

Conclusions:

Compared with patients receiving placebo, patients treated with recombinant human soluble thrombomodulin having higher baseline thrombin generation biomarker levels had lower mortality. Further research regarding the predictive role of coagulation biomarkers for recombinant human soluble thrombomodulin treatment response in sepsis-associated coagulopathy is warranted to evaluate clinical relevance.

### COVID-19 and sepsis are associated with different abnormalities in plasma procoagulant and fibrinolytic activity [^116qLfTS]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with derangement in biomarkers of coagulation and endothelial function and has been likened to the coagulopathy of sepsis. However, clinical laboratory metrics suggest key differences in these pathologies. We sought to determine whether plasma coagulation and fibrinolytic potential in patients with COVID-19 differ compared with healthy donors and critically ill patients with sepsis. Approach and Results: We performed comparative studies on plasmas from a single-center, cross-sectional observational study of 99 hospitalized patients (46 with COVID-19 and 53 with sepsis) and 18 healthy donors. We measured biomarkers of endogenous coagulation and fibrinolytic activity by immunoassays, thrombin, and plasmin generation potential by fluorescence and fibrin formation and lysis by turbidity. Compared with healthy donors, patients with COVID-19 or sepsis both had elevated fibrinogen, d-dimer, soluble TM (thrombomodulin), and plasmin-antiplasmin complexes. Patients with COVID-19 had increased thrombin generation potential despite prophylactic anticoagulation, whereas patients with sepsis did not. Plasma from patients with COVID-19 also had increased endogenous plasmin potential, whereas patients with sepsis showed delayed plasmin generation. The collective perturbations in plasma thrombin and plasmin generation permitted enhanced fibrin formation in both COVID-19 and sepsis. Unexpectedly, the lag times to thrombin, plasmin, and fibrin formation were prolonged with increased disease severity in COVID-19, suggesting a loss of coagulation-initiating mechanisms accompanies severe COVID-19.

Conclusions

Both COVID-19 and sepsis are associated with endogenous activation of coagulation and fibrinolysis, but these diseases differently impact plasma procoagulant and fibrinolytic potential. Dysregulation of procoagulant and fibrinolytic pathways may uniquely contribute to the pathophysiology of COVID-19 and sepsis.

### Utility of thromboelastography and / or thromboelastometry in adults with sepsis: a systematic review [^116FHZ4P]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

In addition to hypo- and hypercoagulability, TEG/ROTEM can detect impairment in fibrinolysis, expressed as increased lysis indices. Hypofibrinolysis has been demonstrated in several studies in sepsis patients, but the clinical relevance of this finding must be determined. Of note, increased lysis indices were shown to be helpful in discriminating sepsis and SIRS patients.

TEG/ROTEM has been shown to be promising in diagnosing DIC, and in particular, the combination of various parameters (reaction times, maximum amplitude, and α angle) improves diagnostic value. A score to detect DIC with the use of thromboelastometry has been developed, including prolonged reaction and K times and decreased α angle and maximum amplitude. This score was validated in patients with an underlying disease known to be associated with DIC and with an ISTH DIC score of more than 5. However, to date, this score has not been validated in critically ill patients with sepsis, and included studies in this review consisted of relatively small patient groups. Therefore to date, quality of evidence supporting the use of TEG/ROTEM to diagnose DIC is low, and further research is necessary.

Several factors in the way TEG/ROTEM measurements were conducted may have affected the results of included studies. First, coagulopathy in sepsis is a dynamic process, evolving from subtle activation of coagulation to overt DIC. Therefore, timing may greatly influence TEG/ROTEM results. Performing sequential measurements will probably provide better insight into the development of coagulation derangements. Timing and number of measurements in included studies varied widely.

Second, no uniform definitions exist of hypo- and hypercoagulability. Reference values for patients with sepsis are not widely assessed, and only one study determined cut-off values for a cohort of sepsis patients. Some studies classified patients as hypo- or hypercoagulable when measurements were outside preset reference ranges; others compared patients with healthy individuals; and some compared mean or median values among or within different patient groups. To compare patient categories and possibly investigate therapeutic interventions in the coagulation system, validated universal reference values and definitions are essential. For ROTEM, a multicenter investigation has been undertaken to assess reference values. A study to verify reference intervals of TEG reagents was recently completed (NCT01357928), and we hope that results will contribute to further standardization of TEG.

### Utility of thromboelastography and / or thromboelastometry in adults with sepsis: a systematic review [^112FKVKZ]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Ability of TEG/ROTEM to detect sepsis-induced coagulopathy

In five studies, all TEG/ROTEM measurements in sepsis were within reference values. These studies included a total of 176 sepsis and severe sepsis patients. In seven studies, TEG/ROTEM revealed pathologic changes ranging from distinct hypercoagulability to predominantly hypocoagulable profiles. Four prospective observational studies, together including 214 patients, reported heterogeneous results with patients showing hyper- and hypocoagulability. Impaired fibrinolysis in sepsis patients was demonstrated in five different observational studies, with a total of 162 patients. Two of these studies reported increased lysis indices as the only abnormal ROTEM parameter in 30 and 39 patients with septic shock. In a small cohort of 16 patients with severe sepsis; patients were randomized to tight glycemic control or conventional glucose levels; strict regulation of glucose levels resulted in enhancement of fibrinolysis, as measured by lysis index with ROTEM.

Overall, if sepsis-induced coagulopathy was detected, the proportion of sepsis patients with sepsis-induced coagulopathy that was detected by TEG/ROTEM ranged from 43% to 100%.

Altogether, in the majority of studies, TEG/ROTEM was able to detect sepsis-induced coagulopathy. However, changes in parameters were heterogeneous, and study designs varied widely, with a lack of clarity in interpretation of test results. Based on this, the quality of evidence supporting the use of TEG/ROTEM to detect sepsis-induced coagulopathy is considered low.

Additional value of TEG/ROTEM in sepsis compared with standard coagulation tests

Studies designed to compare conventional coagulation tests directly with TEG/ROTEM for the detection of sepsis-induced coagulopathy were not retrieved.

However, two studies assessed the value of thromboelastography in the detection of DIC. A prospective pilot study in 28 sepsis patients showed that CFT, MCF, and α angle discriminated moderately between overt DIC and no DIC. ROC values were 0.815 (CI, 0.624 to 0.935) for CFT, 0.891 (CI, 0.715 to 0.975) for MCF, and 0.828 (CI, 0.639 to 0.943) for α angle. Combination of CFT, MCF, and α resulted in a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 75%, with a positive likelihood ratio of 4.0 and negative likelihood ratio of 0.0 for the diagnosis of DIC.

### COVID-19 and coagulation dysfunction in adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113iAKeT]. Journal of Medical Virology (2021). Medium credibility.

Fibrinogen is an essential part of the blood coagulation cascade. In sepsis, decreased fibrinogen is associated with an increased mortality, which is related to consumptive coagulopathy. The elevated fibrinogen has been documented in infectious diseases, acute stroke, and myocardial infarction. The current study is the first meta‐analysis to summarize increased fibrinogen levels in severe COVID‐19 adults. In addition, fibrinogen is an acute‐phase protein, which is induced by interleukin 6 and associated with inflammatory responses. Once infection occurs, hepatic synthesis of fibrinogen increases 2 to 10 times. Possibly different from septic coagulation disorder, early severe COVID‐19 patients present hypercoagulability rather than consumptive coagulopathy.

Prolonged PT and APTT are linked to anticoagulant, coagulation factor deficiency, and fibrinolysis, which have been used as laboratory tools to predict bleeding. The performance of PT and APTT was contradictory in the initial research of severe COVID‐19 cases. Some studies showed shortened PT and APTT in severe COVID‐19 patientswhile another study reported prolonged PT and APTT. Our meta‐analysis found no difference in PT and APTT between the severe and nonsevere groups upon admission. Probably, PT and APTT may fail in an early recognition and be influenced by many factors (eg, anticoagulant). However, this finding should be interpreted with caution because of the high heterogeneity and much less included literature. More clinical trials are urgently needed to investigate the relation between PT/APTT and COVID‐19 severity.

### Four-day antithrombin therapy does not seem to attenuate hypercoagulability in patients suffering from sepsis [^111tDSSv]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

Introduction

Sepsis activates the coagulation system and frequently causes hypercoagulability, which is not detected by routine coagulation tests. A reliable method to evaluate hypercoagulability is thromboelastography (TEG), but this has not so far been used to investigate sepsis-induced hypercoagulability. Antithrombin (AT) in plasma of septic patients is decreased, and administration of AT may therefore reduce the acquired hypercoagulability. Not clear, however, is to what extent supraphysiologic plasma levels of AT decrease the acute hypercoagulability in septic patients. The present study investigates the coagulation profile of septic patients before and during four day high-dose AT therapy.

Methods

Patients with severe sepsis were randomly assigned to receive either 6,000 IU AT as a bolus infusion followed by a maintenance dose of 250 IU/hour over four days (n = 17) or placebo (n = 16). TEG, platelet count, plasma fibrinogen levels, prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time were assessed at baseline and daily during AT therapy.

Results

TEG showed a hypercoagulability in both groups at baseline, which was neither reversed by bolus or by maintenance doses of AT. The hypercoagulability was mainly caused by increased plasma fibrinogen, and to a lesser extent by platelets. Plasmatic coagulation as assessed by the prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time was similar in both groups, and did not change during the study period.

Conclusion

The current study shows a distinct hypercoagulability in patients suffering from severe sepsis, which was not reversed by high-dose AT treatment over four days. This finding supports recent data showing that modulation of coagulatory activation in septic patients by AT does not occur before one week of therapy.

PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF SIC

In Vivo Thrombin Generation

Thrombin or factor (F) IIa is a serine protease, converter of fibrinogen to insoluble fibrin, potent mediator of platelet activation, and strong potentiator of systemic coagulation via a series of positive feedback reactions, that serve to maintain its own production (Figure 1). The process of in vivo thrombin generation occurs through 3 phases: initiation, amplification, and propagation. The initiation phase starts on tissue factor (TF)–expressing cells such as monocytes, endothelial cells (EC), or platelets. – TF, a procoagulant glycoprotein, binds to and converts FVII to activated FVII (FVIIa). TF and FVII are essential coagulation proteins as their complete deficiency results in fatal perinatal bleeding. The extrinsic tenase complex (TF + FVIIa) then activates FX and FV to form the prothrombinase complex (FXa + FVa), which proteolytically cleaves prothrombin to thrombin. In the amplification phase, thrombin strongly induces platelet activation, which creates more surface area for further clotting reactions. Thrombin also cleaves circulating FVIII from its carrier, von Willebrand factor (vWF), and converts it to its active form (FVIIIa). Extrinsic tenase and activated FXI will activate FIX to FIXa, which complexes with FVIIIa on activated platelets to form the intrinsic tenase (FIXa + FVIIIa) and further generate FXa and amplify thrombin generation. In the final phase of propagation, persistent amounts of thrombin are generated on activated platelets for continued coagulation.

Figure 1.
Thrombin generation and propagation during sepsis. Thrombin is a powerful positive feedback signaler for its own propagation. Sepsis results in the release of PAMPs from microbial sources, or DAMPs from injured host cells, both of which lead to immune cell activation and TF expression from monocytes, endothelial cells, and neutrophils with subsequent thrombin generation. Moreover, activated NETs serve as polyanionic surface for further thrombin generation. Platelet degranulation, leukocyte TF expression, NET formation, and PLA formation propagate (dotted lines) thrombin generation leading to fibrin production and platelet consumption resulting in microvascular thrombosis.

Prophylactic plasma transfusion in nonbleeding pediatric septic shock or sepsis-associated organ dysfunction — We suggest against prophylactic plasma transfusion in nonbleeding children with septic shock or other sepsis-associated organ dysfunction and coagulation abnormalities (weak recommendation, very low quality of evidence). Prophylactic plasma transfusion refers to an abnormality in laboratory coagulation testing without active bleeding. In an RCT of critically ill children without sepsis, 81 children less than 2 years old were randomized and the prophylactic group received a higher plasma volume (29.7 vs 16.1 mL/kg; p < 0.001) without differences in packed red blood cell (RBC) transfusion requirements or blood loss. A meta-analysis of 80 RCTs concluded no consistent evidence for benefit of prophylactic plasma transfusion, and observational pediatric studies associate plasma transfusions with worse clinical outcomes and frequent failure to correct abnormal coagulation tests. However, some specific patient populations might benefit, such as those at high risk for disseminated intravascular coagulopathy, children with comorbid cancer, or children with sepsis on extracorporeal life support.

### Association between biomarkers of endothelial injury and hypocoagulability in patients with severe sepsis: a prospective study [^116hrB54]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Sepsis coagulopathy evolves from initial activation of coagulation and fibrinolysis followed by late fibrinolytic shutdown and exhaustion of the natural anticoagulant systems, the latter mainly due to progressive endothelial disruption and damage. Though patients with severe sepsis display evidence of varying degrees of coagulopathy with low or declining platelet count, low coagulation factor and fibrinogen levels and high or increasing D-dimer level, these conventional coagulation parameters do not reveal functional whole blood hemostasis, including changes in fibrinolysis and platelet (dys)function. In contrast, viscoelastic hemostatic whole blood tests like thrombelastography (TEG®, Hemoscope-Hemonetics, Niles, IL, US) and rotation thromboelastometry (ROTEM®, TEM Inc. Durham, NC, US) display functional hemostasis in whole blood, including fibrinolysis and platelet function, and multiple studies have characterized sepsis coagulopathy by these tests. The endothelium plays a key role in balancing hemostasis, and there is emerging evidence that endothelial activation and damage are critical drivers of coagulopathy in acute critical illness, including severe sepsis.

Given that severe sepsis is associated with concurrent coagulopathy and endothelial disruption and damage, the aim of the present study was to investigate the association between coagulopathy, evaluated by whole blood TEG, and endothelial activation and/or damage in patients with severe sepsis. We hypothesized that high levels of biomarkers reflecting endothelial activation and/or damage would be independently linked to concurrent whole blood TEG hypocoagulability. In brief, the study confirmed our hypothesis by demonstrating that single time-point measurements of plasma markers of endothelial damage and, to a lesser degree, endothelial activation, were independently associated with concurrent whole blood hypocoagulability by TEG in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock. Clinically, endothelial protective interventions would be expected to attenuate the sepsis-induced hypocoagulability.

### 2001 SCCM / ESICM / ACCP / ATS / SIS international sepsis definitions conference [^113jUrqG]. Critical Care Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

In 1991, the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) and the Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM) convened a "Consensus Conference", the goals of which were "to provide a conceptual and a practical framework to define the systemic inflammatory response to infection, which is a progressive injurious process that falls under the generalized term 'sepsis' and includes sepsis-associated organ dysfunction as well". The general definitions introduced as a result of that conference have been widely used in practice and have served as the foundation for inclusion criteria for numerous clinical trials of therapeutic interventions. Nevertheless, there has been an impetus from experts in the field to modify these definitions to reflect our current understanding of the pathophysiology of these syndromes.

Design

Several North American and European intensive care societies agreed to revisit the definitions for sepsis and related conditions. This conference was sponsored by the SCCM, The European Society of Intensive Care Medicine (ESICM), The American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP), the American Thoracic Society (ATS), and the Surgical Infection Society (SIS).

Methods

The conference was attended by 29 participants from Europe and North America. In advance of the conference, five subgroups were formed to evaluate the following areas: signs and symptoms of sepsis, cell markers, cytokines, microbiologic data, and coagulation parameters. The subgroups corresponded electronically before the conference and met in person during the conference. A spokesperson for each group presented the deliberation of each group to all conference participants during a plenary session. A writing committee was formed at the conference and developed the current article based on executive summary documents generated by each group and the plenary group presentations. The present article serves as the final report of the 2001 International Sepsis Definitions Conference.

Conclusion

This document reflects a process whereby a group of experts and opinion leaders revisited the 1992 sepsis guidelines and found that apart from expanding the list of signs and symptoms of sepsis to reflect clinical bedside experience, no evidence exists to support a change to the definitions. This lack of evidence serves to underscore the challenge still present in diagnosing sepsis in 2003 for clinicians and researchers and also provides the basis for introducing PIRO as a hypothesis-generating model for future research.

### Microvascular endothelial dysfunction: a renewed appreciation of sepsis pathophysiology [^116t1YH4]. Critical Care (2001). Low credibility.

Severe sepsis, defined as sepsis associated with acute organ dysfunction, results from a generalized inflammatory and procoagulant host response to infection. Coagulopathy in severe sepsis is commonly associated with multiple organ dysfunction, and often results in death. The molecule that is central to these effects is thrombin, although it may also have anticoagulant and antithrombotic effects through the activation of Protein C and induction of prostacyclin. In recent years, it has been recognized that chemicals produced by endothelial cells play a key role in the pathogenesis of sepsis. Thrombomodulin on endothelial cells coverts Protein C to Activated Protein C, which has important antithrombotic, profibrinolytic and anti-inflammatory properties. A number of studies have shown that Protein C levels are reduced in patients with severe infection, or even in inflammatory states without infection. Because coagulopathy is associated with high mortality rates, and animal studies have indicated that therapeutic intervention may result in improved outcomes, it was rational to initiate clinical studies.

### Combination of thrombin-antithrombin complex, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, and protein C activity for early identification of severe coagulopathy in initial phase of sepsis: a prospective observational study [^112vuHDP]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Current criteria for early diagnosis of DIC have some potential limitations. Considering easy implementation, most criteria, including ISTH non-overt DIC and JAAM acute DIC criteria, use readily available coagulation tests for scoring. However, it is clear that global coagulation tests, such as PT and platelet count, primarily reflect the result of consumption and impaired synthesis rather than direct ongoing coagulopathy. Kinasewitz et al. and Dhainaut et al. established a simple diagnostic scoring system for the acute phase of septic coagulopathy, but these systems depend partly on worsening trends of global markers, which take at least two days to identify.

Several hemostatic molecular biomarkers, including AT, PC, TAT, PIC and PAI-1, have also been evaluated in patients with sepsis, but the reported results were inconsistent. Several possible explanations could account for these conflicting results. First, we demonstrated dynamic changes in the biomarkers within a few days in the initial phase of sepsis, which is consistent with previous studies; therefore, the timing of biomarker measurement is important for interpretation of the results. Second, the cutoff value is another factor that influences the diagnostic ability of biomarkers. Oh et al. and Egi et al. evaluated the cutoff value of the lower limit of normal (70%) in AT levels for ISTH non-overt DIC criteria, and showed that the diagnostic ability for overt DIC did not improve by adding AT to non-overt DIC criteria. In our study, AT activity, as well as PC, was decreased below the lower limit of normal, even in most of the patients without overt DIC, and the cutoff value of AT level to discriminate patients with and without overt DIC was much lower (46.1%). Last, most of the previous studies evaluated the impact of hemostatic biomarkers on prognosis in patients with sepsis. We found that some plasma biomarkers at baseline were good predictors for the development of overt DIC, but were less predictive for 28-day mortality compared with Day 2 markers, which indicates that persistence of coagulopathy, rather than just the development of it, influences the prognosis in patients with sepsis. In addition, multiple interactive systemic factors other than coagulopathy would be involved in the pathogenesis of organ failure and the risk of mortality. We, therefore, evaluated diagnostic and prognostic values of biomarkers individually.

### Combination of thrombin-antithrombin complex, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, and protein C activity for early identification of severe coagulopathy in initial phase of sepsis: a prospective observational study [^113McQm3]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Current criteria for early diagnosis of coagulopathy in sepsis are limited. We postulated that coagulopathy is already complicated with sepsis in the initial phase, and severe coagulopathy or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) becomes overt after progressive consumption of platelet and coagulation factors. To determine early diagnostic markers for severe coagulopathy, we evaluated plasma biomarkers for association with subsequent development of overt DIC in patients with sepsis.

Methods

A single-center, prospective observational study was conducted in an adult ICU at a university hospital. Plasma samples were obtained from patients with sepsis at ICU admission. Fourteen biomarkers including global markers (platelet count, prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, fibrinogen and fibrin degradation product (FDP)); markers of thrombin generation (thrombin-antithrombin complex (TAT) and soluble fibrin); markers of anticoagulants (protein C (PC) and antithrombin); markers of fibrinolysis (plasminogen, α2-plasmin inhibitor (PI), plasmin-α2-PI complex, and plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI)-1); and a marker of endothelial activation (soluble E-selectin) were assayed. Patients who had overt DIC at baseline were excluded, and the remaining patients were followed for development of overt DIC in 5 days, and for mortality in 28 days.

Results

A total of 77 patients were enrolled, and 37 developed overt DIC within the following 5 days. Most patients demonstrated hemostatic abnormalities at baseline with 98.7% TAT, 97.4% FDP and 88.3% PC. Most hemostatic biomarkers at baseline were significantly associated with subsequent development of overt DIC. Notably, TAT, PAI-1 and PC discriminated well between patients with and without developing overt DIC (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), 0.77 (95% confidence interval, 0.64 to 0.86); 0.87 (0.78 to 0.92); 0.85 (0.76 to 0.91), respectively), and using the three together, significantly improved the AUROC up to 0.95 (vs. TAT, PAI-1, and PC). Among the significant diagnostic markers for overt DIC, TAT and PAI-1 were also good predictors of 28-day mortality (AUROC, 0.77 and 0.81, respectively).

Conclusions

Severe coagulation and fibrinolytic abnormalities on ICU admission were associated with subsequent development of overt DIC. A single measurement of TAT, PAI-1, and PC activity could identify patients with ongoing severe coagulopathy, early in the course of sepsis.

### 2001 SCCM / ESICM / ACCP / ATS / SIS international sepsis definitions conference [^116PJa2r]. Intensive Care Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

In 1991, the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) and the Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM) convened a "Consensus Conference", the goals of which were to "provide a conceptual and a practical framework to define the systemic inflammatory response to infection, which is a progressive injurious process that falls under the generalized term 'sepsis' and includes sepsis-associated organ dysfunction as well. The general definitions introduced as a result of that conference have been widely used in practice, and have served as the foundation for inclusion criteria for numerous clinical trials of therapeutic interventions. Nevertheless, there has been an impetus from experts in the field to modify these definitions to reflect our current understanding of the pathophysiology of these syndromes.

Design

Several North American and European intensive care societies agreed to revisit the definitions for sepsis and related conditions. This conference was sponsored by the Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM), The European Society of Intensive Care Medicine (ESICM), The American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP), the American Thoracic Society (ATS), and the Surgical Infection Society (SIS).

Methods

29 participants attended the conference from Europe and North America. In advance of the conference, subgroups were formed to evaluate the following areas: signs and symptoms of sepsis, cell markers, cytokines, microbiologic data, and coagulation parameters. The present manuscript serves as the final report of the 2001 International Sepsis Definitions Conference.

Conclusion

1. Current concepts of sepsis, severe sepsis and septic shock remain useful to clinicians and researchers. 2. These definitions do not allow precise staging or prognostication of the host response to infection. 3. While SIRS remains a useful concept, the diagnostic criteria for SIRS published in 1992 are overly sensitive and non-specific. 4. An expanded list of signs and symptoms of sepsis may better reflect the clinical response to infection. 6. PIRO, a hypothetical model for staging sepsis is presented, which, in the future, may better characterize the syndrome on the basis of predisposing factors and premorbid conditions, the nature of the underlying infection, the characteristics of the host response, and the extent of the resultant organ dysfunction.

### New diagnostic strategy for sepsis-induced disseminated intravascular coagulation: a prospective single-center observational study [^111CdUo7]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Sepsis is often a complication that occurs in the clinical course of medical and surgical patients treated for other diseases, and remains one of the most significant causes of mortality in intensive care units. The most recent international sepsis guidelines entitled "Surviving Sepsis Campaign: International Guidelines for Management of Severe Sepsis and Septic Shock: 2012" recommend early diagnosis and treatment of sepsis to avoid multiple organ failure and other adverse outcomes. Sepsis is diagnosed based on evidence of infection along with the presence of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) defined by the American College of Chest Physicians/Society of Critical Care Medicine (ACCP/SCCM) guidelines. And sepsis was diagnosed when patients met the criteria for SIRS and an infectious source was documented or strongly suspected based on clinical presentation.

The majority of ill patients with SIRS present with coagulation abnormalities. Inflammation and coagulation play pivotal roles in the pathogenesis of sepsis. Evidence of extensive cross-talk between these two systems has been increasing; inflammation leads to the activation of coagulation, which in turn considerably affects inflammatory activity. Since infection-induced disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is closely associated with SIRS in a considerable percentage of patients, patients who exhibit two or more SIRS criteria for more than three consecutive days are frequently associated with DIC. Sepsis is the most common disease associated with DIC. Approximately 20 to 40% of all sepsis patients are complicated with DIC. There are some standard care procedures for sepsis, including the use of antibiotics, oxygen, fluid resuscitation and corticosteroids. However, the mortality rate is still within the range of 30 to 50% in patients with septic shock. Gando et al. reported that DIC is frequently associated with SIRS (83%) and that such patients have a high mortality rate (63%). Thus, the mortality rate of sepsis patients complicated with DIC is clearly higher than that of patients without DIC. Therefore, the early diagnosis and treatment of sepsis-induced DIC are critical for improving the prognosis.

However, there are different diagnostic systems and criteria for SIRS/sepsis and DIC. Furthermore, there are still no diagnostic criteria for sepsis-induced DIC, which may delay diagnosis and treatment initiation, and consequently be detrimental for the patient. Therefore, this study aimed to establish the diagnostic criteria for sepsis-induced DIC.

### Coagulation phenotypes in sepsis and effects of recombinant human thrombomodulin: an analysis of three multicentre observational studies [^112LyUZv]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

A recent randomised trial showed that recombinant thrombomodulin did not benefit patients who had sepsis with coagulopathy and organ dysfunction. Several recent studies suggested presence of clinical phenotypes in patients with sepsis and heterogenous treatment effects across different sepsis phenotypes. We examined the latent phenotypes of sepsis with coagulopathy and the associations between thrombomodulin treatment and the 28-day and in-hospital mortality for each phenotype.

Methods

This was a secondary analysis of multicentre registries containing data on patients (aged ≥ 16 years) who were admitted to intensive care units for severe sepsis or septic shock in Japan. Three multicentre registries were divided into derivation (two registries) and validation (one registry) cohorts. Phenotypes were derived using k -means with coagulation markers, platelet counts, prothrombin time/international normalised ratios, fibrinogen, fibrinogen/fibrin-degradation-products (FDP), D-dimer, and antithrombin activities. Associations between thrombomodulin treatment and survival outcomes (28-day and in-hospital mortality) were assessed in the derived clusters using a generalised estimating equation.

Results

Four sepsis phenotypes were derived from 3694 patients in the derivation cohort. Cluster dA (n = 323) had severe coagulopathy with high FDP and D-dimer levels, severe organ dysfunction, and high mortality. Cluster dB had severe disease with moderate coagulopathy. Clusters dC and dD had moderate and mild disease with and without coagulopathy, respectively. Thrombomodulin was associated with a lower 28-day (adjusted risk difference [RD]: − 17.8% [95% CI − 28.7 to − 6.9%]) and in-hospital (adjusted RD: − 17.7% [95% CI − 27.6 to − 7.8%]) mortality only in cluster dA. Sepsis phenotypes were similar in the validation cohort, and thrombomodulin treatment was also associated with lower 28-day (RD: − 24.9% [95% CI − 49.1 to − 0.7%]) and in-hospital mortality (RD: − 30.9% [95% CI − 55.3 to − 6.6%]).

Conclusions

We identified four coagulation marker-based sepsis phenotypes. The treatment effects of thrombomodulin varied across sepsis phenotypes. This finding will facilitate future trials of thrombomodulin, in which a sepsis phenotype with high FDP and D-dimer can be targeted.

### Megakaryocyte in sepsis: the trinity of coagulation, inflammation and immunity [^114Smidy]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Megakaryocytes are traditionally recognized as cells responsible for platelet production. However, beyond their role in thrombopoiesis, megakaryocytes also participate in inflammatory responses and regulate immune system functions. Sepsis, characterized by life-threatening organ dysfunction due to a dysregulated response to infection, prominently features coagulopathy, severe inflammation, and immune dysfunction as key pathophysiological aspects.

Aim Of Review

Given the diverse functions of megakaryocytes, we explore their roles in coagulation in the context of sepsis, and also in inflammatory and immune regulation. We try to infer future research directions and potential strategies for sepsis prevention and treatment based on the properties of megakaryocytes.

Key Scientific Concepts Of Review

The purpose of this review is to both highlight and provide an update on the functions of megakaryocytes and pathophysiological changes in sepsis. Specific emphasis is given to the role of megakaryocytes in sepsis, which suggests value of future research and clinical application.

### Utility of thromboelastography and / or thromboelastometry in adults with sepsis: a systematic review [^116Y2WxX]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

This systematic review on studies performing TEG/ROTEM measurements in sepsis patients shows that studies were heterogeneous in design, use of control groups, timing of TEG/ROTEM measurements, and chosen end points. Internal validity of most studies is limited. Although most studies included sepsis patients according to the ACCM/SCCP definition, external validity is limited because of relatively small patient groups in most studies. Furthermore, standardization of used tests is limited, and most studies had methodologic flaws, which may have resulted in bias. Thereby, the overall quality of evidence on the value of TEG/ROTEM in adults with sepsis is considered low.

Results of TEG/ROTEM measurements in sepsis vary widely across studies and show both hypo- and hypercoagulability. This is consistent with the pathophysiology of "consumption coagulopathy" during DIC, in which microvascular thrombi are formed at the expense of a bleeding tendency because of low levels of platelets and coagulation factors. Of note, heterogeneity of results can also be caused by differences in disease severity, as changes were more obvious in severe sepsis patients than in sepsis patients. In addition, variation in the way studies were conducted has probably contributed to differences in outcome.

Interestingly, the degree of hypocoagulation was found to be associated with severity of organ failure. In a study comparing different patient populations, hypocoagulation measured with TEG was most apparent in sepsis patients and associated with a proinflammatory response and organ failure. Timing of measurements may be relevant to these observations, as hypocoagulation was found to be more obvious in the acute phase of sepsis and returned to normal values toward discharge from the ICU.

Included studies varied widely with regard to the detection of hypercoagulability, ranging from 30% to 100%, which may have resulted from variation in timing as well as in the definition of hypercoagulability. Of note, TEG/ROTEM clearly demonstrated hypercoagulability in models of endotoxemia, with a strong correlation with plasma levels of prothrombin fragments F1 + 2.

### Mild induced hypothermia: effects on sepsis-related coagulopathy – results from a randomized controlled trial [^1133BQDV]. Thrombosis Research (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Coagulopathy associates with poor outcome in sepsis. Mild induced hypothermia has been proposed as treatment in sepsis but it is not known whether this intervention worsens functional coagulopathy.

Materials and Methods

Interim analysis data from an ongoing randomized controlled trial; The Cooling And Surviving Septic shock (CASS) study. Patients suffering severe sepsis/septic shock are allocated to either mild induced hypothermia (cooling to 32–34°C for 24hours) or control (uncontrolled temperature).

Trial Registration

NCT01455116. Thrombelastography (TEG) is performed three times during the first day after study enrollment in all patients. Reaction time (R), maximum amplitude (MA) and patients' characteristics are here reported.

Results

One hundred patients (control n = 50 and intervention n = 50; male n = 59; median age 68years) with complete TEG during follow-up were included. At enrollment, 3%, 38%, and 59% had a hypocoagulable, normocoagulable, and hypercoagulable TEG clot strength (MA), respectively. In the hypothermia group, functional coagulopathy improved during the hypothermia phase, measured by R and MA, in patients with hypercoagulation as well as in patients with hypocoagulation (correlation between ΔR and initial R: rho = -0.60, p < 0.0001 and correlation between ΔMA and initial MA: rho = -0.50, p = 0.0002). Similar results were not observed in the control group neither for R (rho = -0.03, p = 0.8247) nor MA (rho = -0.15, p = 0.3115).

Conclusion

Mild induced hypothermia did seem to improve functional coagulopathy in septic patients. This improvement of functional coagulopathy parameters during the hypothermia intervention persisted after rewarming. Randomized trials are warranted to determine whether the positive effect on sepsis-related coagulopathy can be transformed to improved survival.

### New diagnostic strategy for sepsis-induced disseminated intravascular coagulation: a prospective single-center observational study [^116vLazf]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Key messages

We proposed new diagnostic criteria for sepsis-induced DIC.
The optimal two-marker panel for sepsis-induced DIC comprises the following: (1) presepsin, an inflammatory biomarker and (2) protein C, a coagulation marker.
The new sepsis-induced DIC diagnostic criteria were defined as the following three groups: (1) severe, presepsin > 900 pg/mL and PC < 45%; (2) mild, presepsin < 650 pg/mL and PC > 45%, or 650 < presepsin < 900 pg/mL and PC > 55%; and (3) moderate, ranges between those of the severe and mild groups.
The severity of sepsis-induced DIC criteria proposed herein allows the discrimination of patients who have severe status according to DIC, physiological illness (APACHE II), multiple organ failure (SOFA) and mortality.

### A case report of sepsis associated coagulopathy after percutaneous nephrostomy [^115nrtD2]. BMC Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Sepsis-associated coagulopathy or sepsis induced coagulopathy (SAC/SIC) is one of the most common systemic dysfunctions in sepsis. Clinically evident coagulation dysfunction occurs in approximately 50–70% of septic patients, while 35% of these patients will develop into disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), the most severe state of SIC. The symptoms of SAC/SIC are diverse, ranging from mild thrombocytopenia to DIC. The diagnosis of SAC/SIC and DIC is primarily based on laboratory indicators, such as platelet count, PT, FDPs, fibrinogen and D-dimers. Overt DIC is characterized by the elevated levels of FDPs or d-dimers, decreased platelet count, prolonged PT, and decreased fibrinogen levels. Once diagnosed with DIC, clinical treatment is often unsuccessful, so it is important to identify SAC/SIC at early stage. The clinical manifestations and laboratory indicators of SAC/SIC are varied, ranging from mild coagulation activation of coagulation factor markers, to small decreases in platelet count and prolongation of subclinical total coagulation time, to sudden DIC characterized by both widespread microvascular thrombosis and massive bleeding at different sites. The International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) DIC subcommittee suggested simple diagnostic criteria for sepsis induced coagulopathy (SIC) composed of only three parameters: plate count, PT or INR, and SOFA score. Nevertheless, there are still some early and atypical SAC/SIC that cannot be diagnosed in a timely manner. In this paper, we report the diagnosis and treatment of a case of early postoperative bleeding caused by SAC/SIC after double kidney percutaneous nephrostomy, in order to enhance the vigilance of urologists on SAC/SIC, and to identify and treat some atypical SAC/SIC early.

### Prophylactic plasma and platelet transfusion in the critically ill patient: just useless and expensive or even harmful? [^116g7FKG]. BMC Anesthesiology (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

Standard laboratory coagulation tests (SLTs), such as PT/INR and platelet count, are still frequently used to assess coagulopathy and to guide hemostatic interventions. However, Haas et al. recently reviewed the evidence for the usefulness of SLTs to assess coagulopathy and to guide bleeding management in the perioperative and massive bleeding setting. Evidence for the usefulness of SLTs was found in only three prospective trials, investigating a total of 108 patients, whereby microvascular bleeding was a rare finding. No data from RCTs supported the use of SLTs. In contrast, numerous investigations have challenged the reliability of SLTs to assess coagulopathy or guide bleeding management. In another study, Haas et al. demonstrated that PT/INR and aPTT tests overestimate the underlying coagulation factor deficiency if more than one factor is reduced, which typically occurs in dilutional coagulopathy. Thus, impaired PT/INR and aPTT values are a very common and early finding during hemodilution and intraoperative bleeding, and therefore, decision-making based on PT/INR and aPTT may lead to considerable over-transfusion of FFP and other blood products. Nevertheless, increased INR values correlate quite well with EXTEM CT in warfarin-treated patients and healthy controls (Spearman rho = 0.87). Here, EXTEM CT has a sensitivity and specificity of 0.89 and 1.00, respectively, to detect elevated INR above 1.2, with a positive and negative predictive value of 1.00 and 0.88, respectively. However, the correlation between INR and EXTEM CT seem to be different in other setting, such as dilutional coagulopathy, cirrhosis, sepsis, and patients with extracorporeal assist devices. Here, tissue factor-expression on circulating monocytes can result in a shortening of CT in whole blood viscoelastic tests whereas plasmatic SLTs are unable to detect this effect. In contrast to EXTEM CT, the false-negative rate of kaolin-TEG and rapid-TEG (kaolin plus tissue factor activation) for detecting warfarin coagulopathy with either test is clinically unacceptable. This may be due to the fact that the intrinsic pathway is activated in these tests.

### Comparison of published guidelines for management of coagulopathy and thrombosis in critically ill patients with COVID 19: implications for clinical practice and future investigations [^113NT9cf]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Laboratory testing for risk stratification and triage

Both ISTH-IG and ASH are the only societies that recommend monitoring D-dimer, PTT, platelet count, and fibrinogen levels for risk stratification of critical care treatment and consideration of experimental COVID-19 therapies based on changes in these parameters. ISTH-IG also recommends obtaining D-dimer, PTT, platelet count, and fibrinogen for all patients who present with COVID-19 infection to help guide which patients may require admission. Specifically, they provide an algorithm and the following thresholds for admission to the hospital: D-dimer markedly raised three- to fourfold, prothrombin time prolonged, platelet count < 100 × 10⁹, and fibrinogen < 2.0 g/L. Alternatively, the CDC states that there is a lack of prospective data demonstrating laboratory measures of coagulopathy for risk stratification in patients who are asymptomatic or with mild infection, and insufficient data to recommend for or against using such laboratory values to guide management. The SCC-ISTH mentions that the risk stratification algorithm for hospitalized patients requires further study while acknowledging the use of very elevated D-dimer (> 6 times upper limit of normal (ULN)) appears to be a consistent predictor of thrombotic events and poor overall prognosis in this patient population. ACC recommends that risk stratification of COVID-19 patients should be similar to other acutely ill medical patients without COVID-19 while stating that regular monitoring of platelet count, PT, D-dimer, and fibrinogen is important to diagnosing worsening coagulopathy and treatment of underlying conditions of DIC and bacterial superinfections is important.

### Reduction of D-dimer levels after therapeutic administration of antithrombin in acquired antithrombin deficiency of severe sepsis [^111DfvWi]. Critical Care (2005). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Keeping in mind the small number of patients included in this study, we hypothesize that AT favorably influences consumption coagulopathy accompanying DIC as monitored by D-dimer levels. The decline in D-dimer levels after AT substitution may be indicative of a trend towards resolution of the procoagulant state seen in patients with sepsis and DIC. A prospective randomized study will be necessary to further elucidate this issue as well as reveal whether this will translate into diminished morbidity and mortality in patients with DIC accompanying severe sepsis and septic shock.

### NCT05334615 | COVID-19 coagulopathy extension study… [^114EnMW8]. ClinicalTrials (2022). Medium credibility.

Development of coagulopathy is a predictor of mortality in patients with COVID-19. 2 Still, there are no direct mechanistic links established between SARS-CoV-2 infection and coagulopathy or thrombosis. Our pilot results, as well as reports from other groups, demonstrate increased potential for thrombin generation in the plasma of COVID-19 patients. In particular, in our COVID-19 patient cohort we observed that enhanced thrombin generation potential persisted for at least 30 days of hospitalization. We now propose to explore the mechanistic roles of activation of blood cells, microparticles, extracellular histones, interleukin-6, and galectin-3 as mediators of enhanced thrombin generation in patients with COVID-19.

### Consumptive coagulopathy is associated with a disturbed host response in patients with sepsis [^1165qtjN]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2021). Medium credibility.

2.1 Study design, patients, and definitions

This study was conducted as part of the Molecular Diagnosis and Risk Stratification of Sepsis (MARS) project, a prospective observational study in the mixed ICUs of two tertiary teaching hospitals (Academic Medical Center in Amsterdam and University Medical Center in Utrecht). 8, 14, 15, 16 All consecutive patients above 18 years of age who presented with an expected length of stay longer than 24 h admitted between January 2011 and January 2014 were included via an opt‐out method approved by the medical ethical committees of the participating hospitals. The likelihood of infection for which the clinical team initiated antibiotics was classified for each infectious source as none, possible, probable, or definite by research physicians using Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 17 and International Sepsis Forum consensus definitions, 18 as described in Klein Klouwenberg et al. 14 For the current study sepsis was defined in accordance with the Sepsis‐3 definition 19 using data that were prospectively collected during the study period as the presence of infection diagnosed within 24 h after ICU admission with a likelihood of at least possible, accompanied by organ failure as indicated by a Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score of two or more (central nervous system was excluded). When the SOFA score was not available (n = 68) the following variables were used to define organ failure: mechanical ventilation, acute kidney injury (AKI), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), or shock, all on the first day of ICU admission. Hence, for the present investigation data contained within the MARS database were used to identify patients from the entire MARS cohort that fulfilled the Sepsis‐3 definition. AKI and ARDS were defined using strict pre‐set criteria. 20, 21 Shock was defined by the use of noradrenaline for hypotension in a dose of > 0.1 µg/kg/min during at least 50% of the ICU day. Complications that started 2 days or more after ICU admission were defined as ICU‐acquired. Patients were divided into quartiles using the highest PT value measured within 24 h after ICU admission. The first quartile was defined as normal. Patients with a PT in quartiles 2–4 were defined as admissions with a prolonged PT: slightly prolonged PT, intermediately prolonged PT, and extremely prolonged PT. Exclusion criteria were: the absence of a PT measurement or intravenous administration of heparin in the first 24 h after ICU admission, chronic use of a vitamin K antagonist prior to ICU admission, liver cirrhosis, readmissions for an infectious diagnosis within the same hospital admission or within 30 days after the first ICU admission, transferals from other ICUs, and patients with major bleeding on admission defined based on the consensus definition 22, 23 as a fall in hemoglobin level of ≥ 2 g/dl within the first 24 h combined with transfusion of at least two red blood cell units during the first 24 h of ICU stay. For patients who were readmitted to the ICU after 30 days demographic and long‐term mortality data (≥ 30 days and more) are given for the first ICU admission.

### Role of thromboelastography in septic shock… [^114NGQgC]. ClinicalTrials (2017). Low credibility.

Role of Thromboelastography in Septic ShockClinicalTrials. gov ID Study Overview Coagulation dysfunction is frequent in septic patients and it is associated with an increase risk of mortality. During sepsis platelets number usually decreases and their function is reduced and this mechanism is sustained by an inflammatory induced coagulopathy. Some recent studies evaluated the possibility to use viscoelastic whole blood tests of the haemostasis, such as thromboelastography, which analyze all blood components and their interactions during clot formation and dissolution and might be useful for assessing bleeding risk in septic patients. Secondary end points: to evaluate whether a different level of MA correlates with the biomarker of the severity of sepsis such as presepsin, with the biomarker of the severity of infection and whether a pattern of hypocoagulability might be associated with a risk of mortality.

All enrolled patients will undergo a blood sample at admission, after 72 hours and after 7 days and all the following parameters will be measured: Outcome measurements: Intensive Care Unit Length of Stay and mortality at 28 days and at 90 days. Introduction Coagulation dysfunction is frequent in patients with severe sepsis and it is associated with an increase risk of mortality. During sepsis platelets number usually decreases and their function is reduced and this mechanism is sustained by an inflammatory induced coagulopathy. Several studies have showed a correlation between altered function of platelets and sepsis severity. A more recent study identified a possible hypocoagulability pattern among septic patients at risk of bleeding using TEG variable and the authors found a strong correlation with increased risk of death.

Maximun amplitude is one of the variables obtained from TEG analysis and it expresses the strength of the clot and the efficacy of platelet function. A low level of MA describes a lower strength of the clot determined by a lower number or a reduced function of platelet. In one recent study it has been described that a lower MA describing a hypocoagulability pattern might be associated with an increased risk of death. The aim of the present study is to evaluate whether a lower level of MA and a pattern of hypocoagulability might be associated with an increased risk of bleeding and need of transfusion in patients with sepsis. Methods A prospective multicenter observational study will be conducted in five intensive care units of five Italian university hospitals. We asked for Ethic Committee approval.

### Thromboelastometry for the assessment of coagulation abnormalities in early and established adult sepsis: a prospective cohort study [^111vA8gh]. Critical Care (2009). Low credibility.

Discussion

The coagulation system is commonly activated during sepsis as a result of crossreactions with the inflammatory system. In the present cohort study we assessed coagulation abnormalities in septic patients during the critical phase of the illness using ROTEM ® thromboelastometry. In order to evaluate further the relationship between perturbation of the coagulation system and organ dysfunction, we divided the cohort at the median of the initial SOFA score and compared the resulting two groups.

Improvements in SOFA scores of these patients were associated with shortened time to initiation of coagulation, accelerated clot formation, and improved firmness of the final clot at ICU discharge when compared with values on admission. Therefore, we hypothesize that the coagulation system has recovered toward the patients' individual baselines upon discharge from the ICU. Nevertheless, key thromboelastometric variables for the patients in our study remained within the range of normal reference values reported in a multicenter trial. In this context, no signs of overt disseminated intravascular coagulation with adverse bleeding events were observed. Of note, compared with the increase in clot firmness, the rise in the platelet count during the course of critical illness was disproportionately high, whereas fibrinogen levels remained constant. This underlines the observation that fibrinogen levels appear to have a much greater impact on MCF than do changes in platelet count.

### The unique characteristics of COVID-19 coagulopathy [^114UssdE]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Thrombotic complications and coagulopathy frequently occur in COVID-19. However, the characteristics of COVID-19-associated coagulopathy (CAC) are distinct from those seen with bacterial sepsis-induced coagulopathy (SIC) and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), with CAC usually showing increased D-dimer and fibrinogen levels but initially minimal abnormalities in prothrombin time and platelet count. Venous thromboembolism and arterial thrombosis are more frequent in CAC compared to SIC/DIC. Clinical and laboratory features of CAC overlap somewhat with a hemophagocytic syndrome, antiphospholipid syndrome, and thrombotic microangiopathy. We summarize the key characteristics of representative coagulopathies, discussing similarities and differences so as to define the unique character of CAC.

### How we approach thrombosis risk in children with COVID-19 infection and MIS-C [^1119c4Mk]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2021). Medium credibility.

2.1.2 What laboratory workup is considered for thrombosis risk?

CAC, which typically presents with extremely elevated D‐dimer, modest decrease in platelet count, elevation of fibrinogen, and mild prolongation of prothrombin time (PT), is associated with increased risk of thrombosis. 11, 14 CAC is distinct from sepsis‐associated coagulopathy where fibrinogen and platelets are significantly low. The pathophysiology of COVID‐19 suggests that cytokine‐mediated endotheliopathy and platelet activation play a central role in CAC. 11 Markers of endothelial and platelet activation, including ultra‐large multimers of von Willebrand factor (VWF) and VWF antigen, factor VIII, and soluble P‐selectin, are higher in adults admitted to the ICU than in those admitted to regular ward. 33 Viscoelastic testing shows elevated maximal clot amplitude or strength consistent with increased platelet activation and increased fibrinogen in both children and adults. 34, 35 IL‐6, IL‐2, and TNF‐α produced during acute infection are also contributory. Dysregulation in plasma levels of coagulation factors and increased levels of anti‐fibrinolytic factors are correlated with high levels of IL‐6 in adults with acute infection. 36 Imbalance between procoagulant elevation and anticoagulant depletion overwhelms fibrinolysis resulting in a prothrombotic milieu. Elevations in D‐dimer, a biomarker for fibrinolysis, and fibrinogen reflect this prothrombotic milieu. Presence of lupus anticoagulant and antiphospholipid antibodies have also been reported during acute infection. 30 Recently, anti‐A antibodies in individuals with blood type "O" have been shown to have protective effect against SARS‐CoV‐2 invasion. 37

For hospitalized patients with symptomatic acute infection, we typically request complete blood counts, peripheral blood smear, screening coagulation tests (PT, activated partial thromboplastin time [aPTT]), fibrinogen, and D‐Dimer to assess for CAC and disease severity. Inflammatory markers, such as CRP and ferritin, may be used to trend disease progression. In case of prolongation of coagulation tests, lupus anticoagulant testing should be performed to assist the diagnosis of CAC. Other potential biomarkers may be considered for evaluation of children, however their utility to predict clinical outcomes, particularly thrombosis, has not yet been extensively studied.
