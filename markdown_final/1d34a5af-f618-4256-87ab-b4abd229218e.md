## Question

Significance of epithelial cells on UA

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the significance of epithelial cells on urinalysis, how to distinguish contamination from pathology, and what thresholds, collection methods, and guidelines should guide interpretation and action. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the cell types and their anatomic origins. Then, I should verify how traditional "contamination" assumptions affect diagnostic accuracy. Next, I will examine when epithelial cells indicate disease rather than contamination, including infection, kidney injury, and malignancy. After that, I should review how collection methods influence epithelial cell counts. Finally, I will synthesize guideline-concordant, actionable steps and safeguards for interpretation and follow-up [^112VVUi1] [^117XeZs7].

> Let me first confirm the fundamental biology: urine can contain squamous epithelial cells from the external urethral/vulvovaginal surfaces, urothelial (transitional) cells from the renal pelvis, ureter, bladder, and proximal urethra, and renal tubular epithelial cells from the nephron; UP3 immunostaining identifies urothelial origin, and multi-omic studies confirm urine normally contains a heterogeneous epithelial cell mixture, so seeing epithelial cells per se is expected rather than inherently pathologic or necessarily "contaminant" [^116K6kvL] [^1121s5V9] [^1154LQm7].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about contamination; I should verify what the data say about squamous epithelial cells degrading UA performance. Quantitative studies show that SECs correlate with poorer accuracy of leukocyte esterase, pyuria, and bacteriuria for predicting positive cultures, and that when SECs exceed roughly 8 per low-power field the positive likelihood ratio of UA markers falls substantially; catheterized reference cohorts also suggest that > 2 SECs/hpf is atypical for a properly collected specimen, which can help define specimen quality for hematuria workups [^116iG1BJ] [^113VpByz] [^114JkbXq].

> Wait, let me verify the counterpoint: not all epithelial cells imply contamination, and in fact urothelial cells can serve as "clue cells" in infection. UP3-based studies in pregnancy and comparative MSU versus catheter collections show most epithelial cells in urine are urothelial, frequently with adherent bacteria, and MSU often captures more of these shed infected urothelial cells during active bacteriuria; this suggests discarding such samples as "contaminated" could miss true infection biology rather than eliminate noise [^1154LQm7] [^112mtRgP] [^115bpiEa].

> I will now examine renal tubular epithelial cells, because their presence shifts the conversation from contamination to kidney injury; in acute tubular necrosis, we expect renal tubular epithelial cells and muddy brown granular casts reflecting tubular cell detachment, but wait, I should be precise — calling them pathognomonic is too strong, they are highly suggestive within the clinical context and sediment constellation; importantly, automated sediment analyzers under-detect RTE cells and pathologic casts, whereas expert manual microscopy markedly improves etiologic diagnosis of AKI, and even drug labels list reversible RTE-cell–containing casts as sediment abnormalities with certain exposures, underscoring clinical relevance and reversibility [^113XzvuW] [^115k5Psf] [^113TDCbP] [^1157ciAz].

> Next, I should review viral cytopathic findings; in BK polyomavirus, urine cytology may reveal "decoy cells" (urothelial cells with viral inclusions) with a high negative predictive value for BK nephropathy and modest positive predictive value, so finding decoy cells should prompt BK PCR quantification and clinical correlation, especially in immunosuppressed or transplant settings, while recognizing decoy cells signal replication somewhere along the urothelial–renal axis rather than proving parenchymal disease alone [^1116uWSQ] [^115eTcfU].

> But wait, what if the epithelial cells are atypical or frankly malignant; urine cytology can detect high-grade urothelial carcinoma but has limited sensitivity overall, and guidelines integrate cytology variably by risk and indication. EAU guidance recommends voided cytology in suspected upper tract tumors and at defined intervals post-nephroureterectomy, while AUA/SUFU microhematuria guidance suggests cytology or validated markers as an option in selected intermediate‑risk patients seeking to avoid cystoscopy, acknowledging tradeoffs in sensitivity and specificity; this reminds me to rely on risk-stratified pathways rather than cytology alone [^111uNcQE] [^115kydmr] [^112K99jT] [^115raSWN].

> I need to check how collection methods modulate epithelial cell counts and interpretation; MSU generally yields higher epithelial counts than catheterized samples, yet UP3-positive proportions remain similar, indicating physiologic urothelial shedding that can increase with infection; novel devices may reduce squamous cells but can alter sediment capture in ways that paradoxically change microbiologic yield, so I should confirm origin (e.g., with UP3) rather than reflexively label MSU epithelial cells as contamination when clinical suspicion remains high [^112mtRgP] [^1121s5V9] [^115bpiEa].

> Let me quantify thresholds to anchor decisions; SECs above roughly 8/lpf should prompt caution because UA markers lose diagnostic power for bacteriuria, whereas for microhematuria evaluation, adopting a "properly collected" criterion of ≤ 2 SECs/hpf improves PPV for true hematuria when RBCs are elevated; if these quality criteria are not met, repeating collection or obtaining a catheterized sample is reasonable before making downstream decisions [^116iG1BJ] [^114JkbXq].

> Next, I should review infection guidelines so I don't over-interpret sediment alone; IDSA advises against diagnosing catheter-associated UTI by pyuria alone and recommends culturing from a freshly replaced catheter when treatment is indicated, while EAU infection guidance supports dipstick-based screening for WBCs, RBCs, and nitrite in suspected pyelonephritis; in urethritis/epididymitis algorithms, leukocyte thresholds on urethral smear or spun first-void urine guide diagnosis rather than epithelial cell counts, reinforcing that epithelial cells are context modifiers rather than primary diagnostic criteria [^112CgTpW] [^116gHYk5] [^114gFrrY] [^113noQG3] [^1134SVww].

> Hold on, I should verify a practical framework that aligns with evidence and avoids common pitfalls. First, assess specimen quality by SEC burden and collection method; if high SECs degrade UA performance, repeat with reinforced clean-catch technique or CSU. Second, identify epithelial cell type when it changes management: UP3 positivity and "clue cells" support infection biology, RTE cells and casts raise concern for intrinsic tubular injury, and atypical cells warrant malignancy workup per risk; third, correlate with symptoms, pyuria, bacteriuria, and culture, remembering that automation misses key elements and expert manual microscopy can markedly improve etiologic classification in AKI [^116iG1BJ] [^1154LQm7] [^113TDCbP].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost overlooked the importance of not discarding clinically informative MSU samples; if symptoms and pyuria are present with UP3-positive clue cells, I should not dismiss the UA as "contaminated" solely due to epithelial cells, but rather integrate culture, consider enhanced culture or molecular testing when routine culture is discordant, and escalate to CSU or repeat sampling only when quality clearly compromises interpretation or when decisions hinge on precise quantification [^112mtRgP] [^115bpiEa].

> In summary, I should confirm that epithelial cells on UA are not monolithic contaminants: high counts of squamous cells impair the diagnostic performance of standard UA markers and can flag a suboptimal specimen, whereas urothelial and renal tubular epithelial cells can be diagnostically valuable in infection, kidney injury, and certain viral conditions; the key is to verify cell type and collection quality, correlate with clinical context, and apply guideline-concordant next steps rather than reflexively discarding informative sediments or over-relying on automated readouts [^116K6kvL] [^112VVUi1].

The presence of epithelial cells on urinalysis helps distinguish **contamination from true pathology**: squamous cells usually indicate external contamination and should prompt a repeat clean-catch or catheterized sample [^114JkbXq], whereas transitional and renal tubular cells indicate **urothelial or tubular injury** [^113XzvuW] and warrant further evaluation [^113TDCbP]. High squamous counts reduce urinalysis accuracy for bacteriuria [^113VpByz], so results must be interpreted in clinical context [^116iG1BJ] [^117XeZs7].

## Types of epithelial cells in urinalysis

| **Cell type** | **Origin** | **Clinical significance** |
|-|-|-|
| Squamous epithelial cells | - Distal urethra <br/> - External genitalia | - Usually contamination [^117XeZs7] <br/> - Poor collection technique [^114JkbXq] |
| Transitional epithelial cells | - Renal pelvis <br/> - Ureters <br/> - Bladder <br/> - Proximal urethra | - Urothelial injury [^117XeZs7] <br/> - Infection [^114gFrrY] <br/> - Inflammation <br/> - Neoplasia [^11225T3M] |
| Renal tubular epithelial cells | - Renal tubules | - Tubular injury [^112VVUi1] <br/> - ATN [^113XzvuW] <br/> - Interstitial nephritis [^113TDCbP] <br/> - Glomerulonephritis [^112VVUi1] |

## Clinical significance of epithelial cells in urinalysis

### Squamous epithelial cells

- **Contamination indicator**: High squamous counts (> 5/HPF) typically reflect external contamination from poor collection technique [^114JkbXq].
- **Diagnostic accuracy**: Their presence reduces urinalysis accuracy for bacteriuria [^113VpByz], so results should be interpreted cautiously [^116iG1BJ].
- **Clinical action**: Repeat urinalysis with improved collection (clean-catch or catheterized) is recommended when squamous cells are abundant [^117XeZs7].

---

### Transitional epithelial cells

- **Urothelial injury**: Transitional cells suggest urothelial injury [^117XeZs7] from infection, inflammation, or neoplasia [^11225T3M].
- **Infection marker**: They can indicate UTIs, including cystitis and pyelonephritis.
- **Neoplastic potential**: Atypical or malignant-appearing cells may signal urothelial carcinoma and require further evaluation [^111uNcQE].

---

### Renal tubular epithelial cells

- **Tubular injury marker**: Renal tubular cells indicate tubular injury [^112VVUi1], such as ATN [^113XzvuW], interstitial nephritis, or glomerulonephritis.
- **Acute kidney injury**: Their presence is associated with AKI [^113TDCbP] and can help differentiate intrinsic renal injury from prerenal causes.
- **Drug toxicity**: They may appear with nephrotoxic drugs (e.g. cisplatin, ifosfamide) [^113XzvuW].

---

## Clinical conditions associated with epithelial cells in urinalysis

| **Clinical condition** | **Associated epithelial cells** | **Clinical implications** |
|-|-|-|
| Urinary tract infection (UTI) | - Transitional <br/> - Squamous | - Infection <br/> - Inflammation <br/> - Contamination [^117XeZs7] [^114gFrrY] |
| Acute tubular necrosis (ATN) | Renal tubular | - Tubular injury <br/> - AKI [^113XzvuW] [^113TDCbP] |
| Interstitial nephritis | Renal tubular | - Tubular injury <br/> - Inflammation [^112VVUi1] |
| Glomerulonephritis | Renal tubular | - Glomerular injury <br/> - Inflammation [^112VVUi1] |
| Urothelial carcinoma | Transitional | - Neoplasia <br/> - Malignancy [^117XeZs7] [^111uNcQE] |
| Contamination | Squamous | - Poor collection technique <br/> - External contamination [^117XeZs7] [^114JkbXq] |

---

## Clinical implications and management

Contamination with high squamous counts warrants **repeat urinalysis** with improved collection technique [^114JkbXq]. Transitional cells accompanied by pyuria and bacteriuria support a UTI diagnosis and antibiotic initiation [^114gFrrY]. Detection of renal tubular cells should prompt evaluation for AKI, assessment for nephrotoxin exposure, and monitoring of renal function [^113TDCbP] [^113XzvuW]. Atypical transitional cells necessitate cystoscopy, imaging, and urine cytology.

---

## Limitations and considerations

Interpretation depends on **collection quality**, as poor technique can increase contamination and lead to misinterpretation [^114JkbXq]. Patient factors such as age, sex, and BMI influence epithelial cell presence and interpretation [^113VpByz]. Automated systems can misclassify cells [^115k5Psf], so **manual review** is often required [^112dQZxE] [^113TDCbP].

---

The presence of epithelial cells on urinalysis helps **distinguish contamination from true pathology**: squamous cells typically indicate contamination, whereas transitional and renal tubular cells indicate **urothelial or tubular injury** [^113XzvuW]. Accurate interpretation requires consideration of collection technique [^114JkbXq], patient factors [^113VpByz], and clinical context [^117XeZs7].

## References

### Squamous epithelial cell presence reduces accuracy of urinalysis for prediction of positive urine cultures [^113VpByz]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

The diagnostic value of urinalysis specimens contaminated with squamous epithelial cells (SEC) from the genital surfaces is assumed to be limited compared to clean-catch samples. However, no studies have quantified the change in predictive value in the presence of SECs for individual urinalysis markers.

- **Methods**: In a retrospective, single-center cohort study, we analyzed all urine cultures sent from the ED over a 26-month period with corresponding urinalysis results. Cultures were classified as positive with growth of > 10^4^ colony-forming units of pathogenic bacteria, negative if no growth, or contaminated for all other results. UA specimens were classified as contaminated or clean based on SEC presence. The accuracy of urinalysis markers for prediction of positive cultures was calculated as an area under the curve (AUC) and was compared between contaminated and clean UA specimens.

- **Results**: 6490 paired UA and urine cultures were analyzed, consisting of 3949 clean and 2541 contaminated samples. SEC presence was less common with male gender, older age, and smaller BMI. Urine cultures were 19.2% positive overall, and SECs were more common in contaminated cultures. AUCs for individual markers ranged from 0.557 to 0.796, with pyuria, bacteriuria, and leukocyte esterase having higher AUC in clean samples over contaminated.

- **Conclusion**: Analysis of AUC for individual urinalysis markers showed reduced diagnostic accuracy in the presence of SECs. SEC presence also reflected much higher rates of contaminated cultures. These results support the reduced reliance on contaminated urinalysis markers.

### Chemotherapy-related complications in the kidneys and collecting system: an imaging perspective [^113XzvuW]. Insights into Imaging (2015). Low credibility.

Acute tubular necrosis (ATN) refers to acute renal failure caused by an ischemic or toxic insult to the tubular epithelial cells, resulting in epithelial cell detachment from the basement membrane and causing tubular dysfunction. It presents with a decrease in glomerular filtration rate (GFR), urine osmolality, and the urine/plasma creatinine ratio. Urine sediment is characterized by renal tubular epithelial cells, epithelial cell casts, and muddy brown granular casts. ATN is associated with cisplatin and ifosfamide treatment. While patients may return to baseline kidney function following ATN, some develop an irreversible decline in function. Risk factors for permanent injury include age over 65 years, atheroembolic disease, and preexisting chronic kidney disease. ATN that develops in the hospital setting is associated with a high mortality rate.

- **Imaging findings**: On urography, acute tubular necrosis appears as renal enlargement with prolonged opacification of the renal parenchyma and an increase in density of the pyramids. On sonography, ATN presents as increased cortical echogenicity. Inadequacy of perfusion can also be detected as abnormal Doppler velocity waveforms. On CT imaging, ATN presents with contrast retention in the parenchyma. The "rim sign" can also characterize ATN and is a valuable factor distinguishing infarction from pyelonephritis.

- **Case study**: An 80-year-old woman with gastric cancer mid-treatment with cisplatin and 5-FU. (a) Pretreatment axial CT demonstrating normal renal characteristics. (b) Noncontrast axial CT demonstrating contrast retention in the parenchyma.

### Urinalysis: A comprehensive review [^117XeZs7]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

A complete urinalysis includes physical, chemical, and microscopic examinations. Midstream clean collection is acceptable in most situations, but the specimen should be examined within two hours of collection. Cloudy urine is often a result of precipitated phosphate crystals in alkaline urine, but pyuria can also be the cause. A strong odor may result from a concentrated specimen rather than a urinary tract infection. Dipstick urinalysis is convenient, but false-positive and false-negative results can occur. Specific gravity provides a reliable assessment of the patient's hydration status. Microhematuria has a range of causes, from benign to life-threatening. Glomerular, renal, and urologic causes of microhematuria often can be differentiated by other elements of the urinalysis. Although transient proteinuria typically is a benign condition, persistent proteinuria requires further work-up. Uncomplicated urinary tract infections diagnosed by positive leukocyte esterase and nitrite tests can be treated without culture.

### Comparison and interpretation of urinalysis performed by a nephrologist versus a hospital-based clinical laboratory [^113TDCbP]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2005). High credibility.

Urinalysis (UA) is considered the most important laboratory test in evaluating patients with kidney disease. Anecdotally, we have observed differences between results of UA performed by nephrologists compared with those performed by certified medical technologists or clinical laboratory scientists that could affect a clinician's diagnosis. Whether there are differences between UA performed by the clinical laboratory and that performed by a nephrologist was determined, and the accuracy of diagnosis based on interpretation of the UA was compared.

- **Methods**: Urine samples were obtained from 26 patients with acute renal failure (ARF). An aliquot of urine was sent to the clinical laboratory for UA. Nephrologist A, blinded to the patient's clinical information, performed a UA on the other aliquot of urine, generated a report, and assigned the most likely diagnosis for ARF based on UA findings. Nephrologist B, also blinded to the clinical information, reviewed Nephrologist A's UA reports and assigned a diagnosis for ARF to each report. Nephrologists A and B both assigned a diagnosis (or diagnoses) for the ARF based on laboratory UA results. These four sets of diagnoses were compared with those assigned by consultation nephrologists.

- **Results**: Nephrologist A correctly diagnosed the cause of ARF in 24 of 26 samples (92.3% success rate) based on his performance of the UA. Diagnoses by nephrologists A and B, based on their review of the clinical laboratory UA report, were correct in only 23.1% and 19.2% of the samples, respectively. Accuracy of diagnosis for Nephrologist B improved.

### How reliable is automated urinalysis in acute kidney injury [^115k5Psf]. Laboratory Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Examination of urine sediment is crucial in acute kidney injury (AKI). In such renal injury, tubular epithelial cells, epithelial cell casts, and dysmorphic red cells may provide clues to etiology. The aim of this study was to compare automated urinalysis findings with manual microscopic analysis in AKI.

- **Methods**: Samples from patients diagnosed with AKI and control patients were included in the study. Red blood cells, white blood cells, renal tubular epithelial cells/small round cells, casts, and pathologic (path) cast counts obtained microscopically and by a UF1000i cytometer were compared by Spearman test. Logistic regression analysis was used to assess the ability to predict AKI from parameters obtained from the UF1000i.

- **Results**: There was poor correlation between manual and automated analysis in AKI. None of the parameters could predict AKI using logistic regression analysis. However, the increment in the automated path cast count increased the odds of AKI 93 times.

- **Conclusion**: Automated urinalysis parameters are poor predictors of AKI, and there is no agreement with manual microscopy.

### Pediatric urine testing [^112uhHoH]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Today, urinalysis is one of the most common clinical tests ordered for adult and pediatric patients. Because urine specimens are usually readily available and are obtained noninvasively, urine testing is particularly well-suited for children. This article discusses the most common urine tests performed in children for screening purposes, as well as less common tests used for diagnosing specific disorders.

- **Special considerations**: Special considerations regarding urine specimen collection in children are discussed.
- **Underused tests and new applications**: Some simple tests that are underused by clinicians are mentioned, along with exciting new molecular applications of urine testing.

### Podocyturia: An emerging biomarker for kidney injury [^115LcAoL]. BMC Nephrology (2025). High credibility.

Podocyte injury is an established hallmark of kidney disease progression. Podocyte loss is a widely proven hypothesis to explain, in part, glomerular damage. Regardless of the underlying kidney disease, the pathophysiologic processes frequently involve the glomerulus. A growing body of evidence considers that podocyte detachment (podocytopathy) and their presence in the urine (podocyturia) are hallmarks of glomerular disease progression. As such, developing new tools to monitor disease progression non-invasively is of major clinical importance. Detection of podocytes in the urine as a biomarker of disease progression would be a major achievement toward the development of such tools. This review summarizes knowledge about podocyturia.

### Diagnostic approach to and differential diagnosis of clear cell and glandular lesions of the lower urinary tract [^11225T3M]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

A variety of glandular and clear cell lesions may be seen in the urinary bladder and/or urethra, ranging from benign to malignant primary and secondary tumors. Lesions with no malignant potential include reactive processes, such as nephrogenic metaplasia, and may show similar morphologic features as an infiltrative neoplasm, particularly in small biopsies. Similarly, ectopic tissues of Müllerian origin may be seen in the lower urinary tract, and their distinction from a true glandular neoplasm is essential to avoid overtreatment. A wide variety of primary and secondary malignant tumors exist with varying degrees of glandular and clear cell features. Therefore, surgical pathologists must be aware of the full scope of possible lesions to avoid misdiagnosis.

- **Objective**: To provide a practical framework for approaching the diagnosis of clear cell and glandular lesions of the urinary bladder/urethra and prostate, highlighting the strengths and limitations of various diagnostic features and ancillary tests.

- **Data sources**: A review of the literature was performed to obtain data regarding up-to-date diagnostic features and ancillary studies.

- **Conclusions**: In summary, distinct morphologic and immunohistochemical features and clinical and radiologic correlation are essential to establish an accurate diagnosis when such cases with glandular and clear features are encountered in the lower urinary tract.

### Urothelial cells may indicate underlying bacteriuria in pregnancy at term: a comparative study [^117DoRJM]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). Low credibility.

The urinary tract undergoes various physiological adaptations in pregnancy. The effect of increased progesterone leads to ureteral dilatation, reduced ureteral tone, and an increased potential for glycosuria, which encourages microbial growth. These changes predispose pregnant women to infections, and 1–4% of women develop an acute bladder infection for the first time during pregnancy. If untreated, bacteria may ascend the renal tract, causing pyelonephritis, a major cause of maternal morbidity and mortality.

Dogma defines a urinary tract infection (UTI) as the presence and multiplication of microorganisms in one or more structures of the urinary tract with associated tissue invasion. This may present with symptoms such as dysuria, frequency, urgency, and suprapubic pain, or be asymptomatic. Routine urine culture techniques are designed to favor the growth of common uropathogens. Threshold bacterial counts of ≥ 10^5 total colony-forming units per milliliter (cfu/ml) of urine are used to discriminate between true infection and contamination of the urine sample by vulvo-vaginal organisms. At present, this method of diagnosing UTIs is standard practice in UK laboratories, despite evidence of insensitivity. The majority of urine cultures do not surpass diagnostic thresholds in routine practice.

Contamination occurs when bacteria from the skin surfaces get into the urine culture. By proxy, a urine sample is presumed to be contaminated if epithelial cells are detected. Historically, urethral catheterization has been the gold standard for urine collection as…

### Urine: Waste product or biologically active tissue [^112qKV3Z]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2018). Low credibility.

Historically, urine has been viewed primarily as a waste product with little biological role in the overall health of an individual. Increasingly, data suggest that urine plays a role in human health beyond waste excretion. For example, urine might act as an irritant and contribute to symptoms through interaction with — and potential compromise of — the urothelium.

To explore the concept that urine may be a vehicle for agents with potential or occult bioactivity and to discuss existing evidence and novel research questions that may yield insight into such a role, the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Disease invited experts in the fields of comparative evolutionary physiology, basic science, nephrology, urology, pediatrics, metabolomics, and proteomics (among others) to a Urinology Think Tank meeting on February 9, 2015.

This report reflects ideas that evolved from this meeting and literature, including the concept of urine quality, and the biological, chemical, and physical characteristics of urine, such as the microbiota, cells, exosomes, pH, metabolites, proteins, and specific gravity. Additionally, the manuscript presents speculative, and hopefully testable, ideas about the functional roles of urine constituents in health and disease.

Moving forward, there are several questions that need further understanding and pursuit. There were suggestions to consider actively using various animal models and their biological specimens to elaborate on basic mechanistic information regarding human bladder.

### Review article: BK virus in systemic lupus erythematosus [^1116uWSQ]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Both qualitative and quantitative assessments for BKV are available for diagnosis and management. Since viruria often precedes viremia by several weeks, urine cytology was first utilized to detect the presence of epithelial cells containing BK viral inclusions, which were called "decoy cells". Decoy cells are a morphological marker for BKV replication. Detection of decoy cells has a positive predictive value (PPV) of 27% to indicate BKVN and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 100%. However, the presence of decoy cells does not discriminate between lower urinary tract versus renal parenchymal infection.

A more specific test to quantify the BK viral load from the urine and blood is via PCR. If the urinary BK virus PCR is negative, then it is more sensitive for excluding BKV as a cause of disease. A positive serum BK virus PCR has a PPV of 50–85% for BKVN and an NPV of 100%. Based on the transplant literature, when the urine BKV DNA > 1 × 10^7 copies/ml and/or plasma BKV DNA > 1 × 10^4 copies/ml, a diagnosis of "presumptive BKVN" is made, even in the absence of demonstrable BKV replication in renal biopsies. However, there is no established cutoff value for the level of viruria and viremia that is associated with BKVN in non-renal transplant patients.

A renal biopsy, to identify the typical intranuclear viral inclusion bodies in the renal tubular epithelial cells, remains the gold standard for BKVN diagnosis. However, even the renal biopsy can have false negatives of up to 30% due to the focality of the BKV in the renal tissue.

### 2016 European guideline on the management of non-gonococcal urethritis [^1134SVww]. International Journal of STD & AIDS (2016). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for non-gonococcal urethritis, specifically concerning urethral smear, the IUSTI 2016 guidelines recommend obtaining a Gram or methylene-blue stained urethral smear from the anterior urethra. This confirms urethritis by demonstrating polymorphonuclear leukocytes (5 polymorphonuclear leukocytes/hpf, averaged over 5 fields with the greatest concentration of polymorphonuclear leukocytes).

### Urothelial cells may indicate underlying bacteriuria in pregnancy at term: a comparative study [^112mtRgP]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). Low credibility.

There is no single validated method for urine sampling in pregnancy. It remains unclear which technique is optimal for identifying true bacteriuria while discriminating against urine contamination in pregnant women. The aim of this study was to compare midstream urine (MSU) and catheter specimen of urine (CSU) samples at term pregnancy for signs of bladder distress, bacterial infection, and urine contamination. The study sought to determine if CSU samples have a lower rate of contamination compared to MSU samples.

### Epithelial cell states associated with kidney and allograft injury [^116o3YXe]. Nature Reviews Nephrology (2024). Low credibility.

The kidney epithelium, with its intricate arrangement of highly specialized cell types, constitutes the functional core of the organ. Loss of kidney epithelium is linked to the loss of functional nephrons and a subsequent decline in kidney function. In kidney transplantation, epithelial injury signatures observed during post-transplantation surveillance are strong predictors of adverse kidney allograft outcomes. However, epithelial injury is currently neither monitored clinically nor addressed therapeutically after kidney transplantation.

Several factors can contribute to allograft epithelial injury, including allograft rejection, drug toxicity, reinfections, and postrenal obstruction. The injury mechanisms that underlie allograft injury overlap partially with those associated with acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) in the native kidney. Studies using advanced transcriptomic analyses of single cells from kidney or urine have identified a role for kidney injury-induced epithelial cell states in exacerbating and sustaining damage in AKI and CKD. These epithelial cell states and their associated expression signatures are also observed in transplanted kidney allografts, suggesting that the identification and characterization of transcriptomic epithelial cell states in kidney allografts may have potential clinical implications for diagnosis and therapy.

### Urethral cancer [^116UzW4r]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2012). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on urethral cancer:

- **Definition**: Urethral cancer is a rare malignancy originating from the epithelial cells of the urethra, with histological types including squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), transitional cell carcinoma, and adenocarcinoma.

- **Pathophysiology**: The pathogenesis of urethral cancer involves the malignant transformation of urethral epithelial cells, often preceded by dysplastic changes. SCC is more common in the distal urethra, while transitional cell carcinoma typically arises in the proximal urethra. The tumor can invade adjacent tissues, including the bladder, vagina, or prostate.

- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of primary urethral carcinoma in the US is estimated at 4.3 per million in males and 1.5 per million in females, with a higher incidence observed in the elderly and African Americans.

- **Risk factors**: Chronic inflammation of the urethra, such as recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs) and urethral strictures, is a recognized risk factor for urethral cancer. HPV 16 infection, sexually transmitted infections (STIs), and prolonged catheter use are also risk factors for urethral cancer.

- **Disease course**: Clinical manifestations of urethral cancer vary according to tumor location and size. Common symptoms include hematuria, urethral bleeding, dysuria, and obstructive symptoms. A palpable urethral mass, perineal pain, and discharge may also be present. Advanced disease can present with pelvic pain, weight loss, and symptoms related to metastasis.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of urethral cancer is generally poor, largely due to late diagnosis and high rates of local recurrence.

### Miacalcin [^112PvbxL]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

**Urine sediment abnormalities**: Coarse granular casts and casts containing renal tubular epithelial cells were reported in young adult volunteers at bed rest who were given injectable calcitonin salmon to study the effect of immobilization on osteoporosis. There was no other evidence of renal abnormality, and the urine sediment normalized after calcitonin salmon was stopped. Periodic examinations of urine sediment should be considered.

### Effect of oxalate on the growth of renal tubular epithelial cells [^114ZpHHF]. Journal of Endourology (2002). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study is to explore the effect of oxalate on renal tubular epithelial cells and its potential role in nephrolithiasis pathogenesis. While oxalate is known as a primary component of calcium oxalate stones, recent evidence highlights its impact on epithelial cells. This study examines oxalate's effects on the growth of these cells across different species and locations.

- **Materials and methods**: Porcine proximal renal tubular epithelial cells (LLC-PK1) and canine distal renal tubular epithelial cells (MDCK) were incubated with varying oxalate concentrations. The growth effect was assessed using the methylthiazoletetrazolium assay.

- **Results**: Increasing oxalate concentrations inhibited the growth of both proximal and distal renal tubular epithelial cell lines.

- **Conclusion**: Oxalate may contribute to stone formation by affecting renal tubular epithelial cell growth and serving as a component of calcium oxalate stones.

**Urine sediment abnormalities**: Coarse granular casts and casts containing renal tubular epithelial cells were reported in young adult volunteers at bed rest who were given injectable calcitonin salmon to study the effect of immobilization on osteoporosis. There was no other evidence of renal abnormality, and the urine sediment normalized after calcitonin salmon was stopped. Periodic examinations of urine sediment should be considered.

### Prostate cancer marker panel with single cell sensitivity in urine [^111reW2y]. The Prostate (2015). Low credibility.

The discussion highlights that approximately a third (31.2%, 10 of 32) of biopsy-negative patients had a positive UCMP assay, potentially indicating false negatives where biopsies missed tumor areas. Although there is no existing evidence to confirm these missed tumor foci, identifying patients with potentially false negative biopsies is a significant advantage of this assay. These patients may benefit from repeat biopsies. Theoretically, all biopsy-positive cases should be positive in the UCMP assay. However, the assay was negative in 9 of 25 biopsy-positive cases. Given our cell-capture method can pick up a single cell, we speculate that post-DRE urine of patients with CaP may not always contain CaP cells, possibly due to the tumor's location and/or size. This observation also highlights the need for improved methods to release CaP cells into urine.

The assay's most critical improvement over previous methods is its sensitivity for capturing minute amounts of cells from urine. In bladder cancer, where many more tumor cells are released into urine (typically thousands of cells available for capture), cytological assays have been effectively used with traditional cell capture approaches. In CaP, 1,000 cells were required for consistent cell capture from urine, which often is not present in post-DRE urine specimens, limiting the applicability of this specific assay. The UCMP assay utilizes translucent filter membranes, on which the captured cells can be directly analyzed by ICC and microscopy.

### Extracellular vesicles in renal diseases: More than novel biomarkers [^116R6QRE]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

Extracellular vesicles from the urine and circulation have gained significant interest as potential diagnostic biomarkers in renal diseases. Urinary extracellular vesicles contain proteins from all sections of the nephron, whereas most studied circulating extracellular vesicles are derived from platelets, immune cells, and the endothelium. In addition to their diagnostic role as markers of kidney and vascular damage, extracellular vesicles may have functional significance in renal health and disease by facilitating communication between cells and protecting against kidney injury and bacterial infection in the urinary tract.

However, the understanding of extracellular vesicles has derived mostly from studies with very small numbers of patients or in vitro data. Accurate assessment of these vesicles remains a challenge due to a lack of consensus in the methodologies to measure extracellular vesicles and the inability of most techniques to capture the entire size range of these vesicles. Newer techniques and standardized protocols to improve the detection of extracellular vesicles are in development. A clearer understanding of the composition and biology of extracellular vesicles will provide insights into their pathophysiologic, diagnostic, and therapeutic roles.

### The application of new complex indicators in the detection of urine [^1172hoyA]. BMC Nephrology (2023). High credibility.

Furthermore, because the concentration of urine components varies greatly under the influence of drinking water, exercise, and other factors, random urine sample tests lack stability. Our findings suggest that patients with biopsy-proven non-hematuria-dominant renal histologic lesions may have high URBCs on automated urine sediment analyzers. In addition, we observed that some patients with hematuria-dominant renal histologic lesions had negative hematuria on routine urinalysis with less than 25 RBCs/µL.

According to Yang et al, the urine SG affects RBCs' morphology, thus altering the identification of RBCs via automated urine sediment analyzers. Considering the mechanism by which the urine sediment analyzer operates, the counting and classification of urinary RBCs are based on signals of forward scattered light, side scattered light, and side-fluorescent light patterns. The pattern of individual light signals is transformed by specific algorithms into individual "fingerprints", allowing the counting, identification, and classification of the particles. This inconsistency might mainly be attributed to a variable mixture of components in the urine, such as cells, casts, crystals, and bacteria.

Furthermore, when the automated urine sediment analyzer interferes with various particle sizes, it may mistake other urinary components for RBCs. In addition, the urine sediment analyzer itself cannot calibrate the urinary concentration or reduced kidney function. Morphological changes in urinary RBCs may be related to counting errors. Urine RBCs in a hypotonic environment exhibit a.

### The use of selected urine chemistries in the diagnosis of kidney disorders [^1125mN4N]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2019). Low credibility.

Urinary chemistries vary widely in both health and disease and are affected by diet, volume status, medications, and disease states. When properly examined, these tests provide important insight into the mechanism and therapy of various clinical disorders that are first detected by abnormalities in plasma chemistries. These tests cannot be interpreted in isolation but instead require knowledge of key clinical information, such as medications, physical examination, and plasma chemistries, including kidney function. When used appropriately and with knowledge of limitations, urine chemistries can provide important insight into the pathophysiology and treatment of a wide variety of disorders.

### The clinical impact of urinalysis screened by automated microscopy compared to reference manual analysis [^112dQZxE]. American Journal of Nephrology (2025). Low credibility.

Clinical laboratories have replaced conventional manual urine microscopy with automated urinalysis; however, concerns persist regarding its validity in detecting specific elements of urinary sediment crucial for evaluating kidney diseases. This study aimed to assess the accuracy of urinary sediment analysis performed by a large hospital laboratory compared to a standardized microscopic review, focusing on patients both with and without kidney disease.

- **Methods**: Urine samples were randomly selected from routine laboratory specimens at a university hospital. Laboratory analysis was performed using LabUmat 2 and Urised 3 PRO equipment (Abbott Diagnostics). In the automated analysis for sediment examination, technicians have the option to reclassify urinary sediment elements as necessary and, if warranted, conduct manual microscopic evaluations to validate findings. The laboratory's analysis was compared with a "reference" analysis, which was double-blinded and conducted by two experienced technicians using bright-field and phase-contrast microscopy.

- **Results**: 503 samples were selected, with 52.3% originating from nephrology outpatient clinic patients. Overall agreement between the laboratory results and the reference analysis was 42.1%. The sensitivity (SN) of the laboratory examination for detecting pathological casts, lipiduria, and renal tubular epithelial cells was low (98%). However, for hyaline casts (SN: 50.4%; SP: 80.9%) and dysmorphic red blood cells (SN: 62.3%; SP: 96.2%), accuracy was intermediate.

### Analysis of human urinary extracellular vesicles reveals disordered renal metabolism in myotonic dystrophy type 1 [^116K6kvL]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Urine contains a mixture of epithelial cells, red blood cells, and white blood cells that may contribute to the urinary extracellular vesicle (EV) pool. Epithelial cell types found in the urine include (1) renal tubular, (2) transitional, which arise from the renal pelvis, ureters, or bladder, and (3) squamous, which arise from the urethra during the process of micturition. To explore the possibility that a mixed population of urinary cells may serve as gene expression biomarkers of myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1), we performed droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) to quantify gene expression. Genes downregulated in DM1 urinary EVs also tended to be expressed at lower levels in mixed urine cells of DM1 compared to unaffected individuals (UA), although to a lesser degree and with statistically non-significant differences (Supplementary Fig. 11). Of the transcripts upregulated in DM1 extracellular RNA (exRNA), KRT20 was significantly increased in mixed urine cells of DM1 versus UA controls, while HPGD appeared similar in both groups. These findings align with a prior study indicating that alternative splice events in urine exRNA are more reliable indicators of DM1 molecular pathogenesis than those found in a mixed population of urine cells.

Ultracentrifugation isolates a pellet consisting of EVs and non-EV-associated high molecular weight protein and protein complexes, some of which bind RNA. To determine whether the mRNAs we are measuring are localized to EV cargo, we used size exclusion chromatography (SEC) to separate EVs from non-EV-associated proteins and RNAs. Using ddPCR, we found that the purified EV fraction is enriched for mRNAs compared to the non-EV-associated proteins and RNAs.

### The diagnostic accuracy of urine-based tests for bladder cancer varies greatly by patient [^112tYwCH]. BMC Urology (2016). Low credibility.

Proper stratification into relevant subgroups allows for recognition of important spectrum associations. There is value in discerning between low-grade and high-grade lesions; high-grade should be detected as early as possible, while the likelihood of missing such a tumor should be as low as possible. In high-risk populations, sensitivity is more important than specificity because the consequences of a missed malignancy are great. FISH exhibits such properties in the smoking subgroup, whereas cytology does not have similar characteristics in the same population. Therefore, a clinician should give stronger consideration to FISH results than cytology results in smokers. Analogous spectrum effects can be seen for indication and cytology.

There are other patient populations where the risks of a procedure often outweigh the benefit. It is preferable for a urine test with a high specificity and low sensitivity in low-grade disease to reduce the number of unnecessary invasive procedures. Age and cytology illustrate this effect because as the patient's age increases, so does the specificity, with a reciprocal decrease in sensitivity. This should spare the elderly patient avoidable cystoscopies. The tradeoff would be that some tumors may be missed for a period of time, but the literature surrounding active surveillance suggests this is safe.

### Spectrum of bacterial colonization associated with urothelial cells from patients with chronic lower urinary tract symptoms [^1135PagU]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2013). Low credibility.

Chronic lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), such as urgency and incontinence, are common, especially among the elderly, but their etiology is often obscure. Recent studies of acute urinary tract infections have implicated invasion by Escherichia coli into the cytoplasm of urothelial cells, with persistence of long-term bacterial reservoirs, but the role of infection in chronic LUTS is unknown. We conducted a large prospective study with eligible patients with LUTS and controls over a 3-year period, comparing routine urine cultures of planktonic bacteria with cultures of shed urothelial cells concentrated in centrifuged urinary sediments. This comparison revealed large numbers of bacteria undetected by routine cultures.

We typed the bacterial species cultured from patient and control sediments under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions and found that the two groups had complex but significantly distinct profiles of bacteria associated with their shed bladder epithelial cells. Strikingly, E. coli, the organism most responsible for acute urinary tract infections, was not the only or even the main offending pathogen in this more chronic condition. Antibiotic protection assays with shed patient cells and in vitro infection studies using patient-derived strains in cell culture suggested that LUTS-associated bacteria are within or extremely closely associated with shed epithelial cells, which explains how routine cultures might fail to detect them. These data have strong implications for the need to rethink our common diagnoses and treatments of chronic urinary tract symptoms.

### Sexually Transmitted Infections Treatment Guidelines, 2021 [^113noQG3]. MMWR. Recommendations and reports (2021). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for acute epididymitis, more specifically with respect to urine tests, CDC 2021 guidelines recommend to obtain any of the following point-of-care tests in all patients with suspected acute epididymitis:

- leukocyte esterase test on first-void urine

- microscopic examination of sediment from a spun first-void urine to demonstrate ≥ 10 WBC/hpf.

### Unique transcriptional programs identify subtypes of AKI [^114ekPYC]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Two metrics, a rise in serum creatinine concentration and a decrease in urine output, are considered tantamount to the injury of the kidney tubule and the epithelial cells thereof (AKI). Yet, neither criterion emphasizes the etiology or the pathogenetic heterogeneity of acute decreases in kidney excretory function. In fact, whether decreased excretory function due to contraction of the extracellular fluid volume (vAKI) or due to intrinsic kidney injury (iAKI) actually share pathogenesis, and should be aggregated in the same diagnostic group, remains an open question.

To examine this possibility, we created mouse models of iAKI and vAKI that induced a similar increase in serum creatinine concentration. Using laser microdissection to isolate specific domains of the kidney, followed by RNA sequencing, we found that thousands of genes responded specifically to iAKI or to vAKI, but very few responded to both stimuli. In fact, the activated gene sets comprised different, functionally unrelated signal transduction pathways and were expressed in different regions of the kidney.

Moreover, we identified distinctive gene expression patterns in human urine as potential biomarkers of either iAKI or vAKI, but not both. Hence, iAKI and vAKI are biologically unrelated, suggesting that molecular analysis should clarify our definitions of acute changes in kidney excretory function.

### Urothelial cells may indicate underlying bacteriuria in pregnancy at term: a comparative study [^1154LQm7]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infection is common in pregnancy. Urine is sampled by mid-stream collection (MSU). If epithelial cells are detected, contamination by vulvo-vaginal skin and skin bacteria is assumed. Outside pregnancy, catheter specimen urine (CSU) is considered less susceptible to contamination. We compared MSU and CSU methods in term pregnancy to test these assumptions.

- **Methods**: Healthy pregnant women at term gestation (n = 32, median gestation 38 + 6 weeks, IQR 37 + 6–39 + 2) undergoing elective caesarean section provided an MSU and CSU for paired comparison. Each specimen was analyzed for bacterial growth and bladder distress through fresh microscopy, sediment culture, and immunofluorescent staining. Participants completed a detailed questionnaire on lower urinary tract symptoms. Epithelial cells found in urine were tested for urothelial origin by immunofluorescent staining of Uroplakin III (UP3), a urothelial cell surface glycoprotein. Urothelial cells with closely associated bacteria, or "clue cells", were also counted. Wilcoxon's signed-rank test was used for paired analysis.

- **Results**: Women reported multiple lower urinary tract symptoms (median 3, IQR 0–8). MSU had higher white blood cell counts (median 67 vs 46, z = 2.75, p = 0.005) and epithelial cell counts (median 41 vs 22, z = 2.57, p = 0.009) on fresh microscopy. The proportion of UP3+ cells was not different (0.920 vs 0.935, z = 0.08, p = 0.95); however, MSU had a higher proportion of clue cells (0.978 vs 0.772, z = 3.17, p = 0.001). MSU specimens exhibited more bacterial growth on sediment culture compared to CSU specimens.

### A revalidation and critique of assumptions about urinary sample collection methods, specimen quality and contamination [^1121s5V9]. International Urogynecology Journal (2020). Low credibility.

Shed urothelial cells are an attractive option for study when examining contamination with different sampling methods. Uroplakin III (UP3), a transmembrane protein found exclusively in the urinary tract, serves as a useful biomarker for discerning the origin of epithelial cells in a urine sample. Thus, it is possible to distinguish contaminating cutaneous and vaginal squamous cells from urothelial umbrella cells using a specific antibody against this protein with immunofluorescence staining protocols.

This study consisted of two parts. The first was a comparative study of the urinalysis results obtained from samples collected by midstream urine (MSU) and catheter specimen of urine (CSU). It utilized a random allocation, cross-over design, and compared urine sampling performances using microscopic pyuria counts, epithelial cell counts, microbial growth from spun cell sediment culture, and UP3-positive cell counts to measure contamination. The second part of the study was a random allocation, cross-over comparison study of contamination obtained with MSU, a novel MSU sampling device called a "Peezy", and naturally voided urine. In this part, we measured microscopic epithelial cell counts using UP3 staining.

### Identification of HIV-1 genitourinary tract compartmentalization by analyzing the env gene sequences in urine [^117PYu8p]. AIDS (2015). Low credibility.

HIV-1 persists indefinitely in memory CD4 T cells and other long-lived cellular reservoirs despite antiretroviral therapy. Our group had previously demonstrated that HIV-1 can establish a productive infection in renal epithelial cells and that the kidney represents a separate compartment for HIV-1 replication. To better understand the viruses in this unique site, we genetically characterized and compared the viruses in blood and urine specimens from 24 HIV-1 infected patients with detectable viremia.

- **Design and methods**: Blood and urine samples were obtained from 35 HIV-1 positive patients. Single-genome amplification was performed on HIV-1 env RNA and DNA isolated from urine supernatants and urine-derived cell pellets, respectively, as well as from plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells from the same individuals. Neighbor-joining trees were constructed under the Kimura 2-parameter model.

- **Results**: We amplified and sequenced the full-length HIV-1 envelope (env) gene from 12 of the 24 individuals, indicating that 50% of the viremic HIV-1-positive patients had viral RNA in their urine. Phylogenetic analysis of the env sequences from four individuals with more than 15 urine-derived env sequences showed that the majority of the sequences from urine formed distinct cluster(s) independent of those peripheral blood mononuclear cell and plasma-derived sequences, consistent with viral compartmentalization in the urine.

Our results suggest the presence of a distinct HIV compartment in the genitourinary tract.

### Urinary biomarkers of tubular injury in chronic kidney disease [^1127TKEv]. Kidney International (2017). Low credibility.

It has been suggested that urinary biomarkers of tubular injury might help predict progression to end-stage renal disease. In this issue, Hsu et al. report that in those with established chronic kidney disease, this information does not add to what we know by quantifying creatinine and albuminuria. Here we discuss the evidence for urinary tubular injury markers in predicting renal outcomes in chronic kidney disease and the areas where measurement of these molecules might be useful in the future.

### Human urine-derived renal epithelial cells provide insights into kidney-specific alternate splicing variants [^1179giHs]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2018). Low credibility.

The majority of multi-exon genes undergo alternative splicing to produce different mRNA transcripts, and this may occur in a tissue-specific manner. Assessment of mRNA transcripts isolated from blood samples may sometimes be unhelpful in determining the effect on the function of putative splice-site variants affecting kidney-specific mRNA transcripts. Here, we present data demonstrating the power of using human urine-derived renal epithelial cells (hUREC) as a source of kidney RNA. We report clinical and molecular genetic data from three affected cases from two families, all with end-stage renal disease by 15 years of age.

In both families, heterozygous variants which are predicted to affect function in NPHP3 were found on one allele, in combination with a synonymous SNV (c.2154C > T; p. Phe718 =), 18 base pairs from the exon–intron boundary within exon 15 of NPHP3. The only mRNA transcript amplified from wild-type whole blood showed complete splicing out of exon 15. Urine samples obtained from control subjects and the father of family 2, who carried the synonymous SNV variant, were therefore used to culture hUREC, allowing us to obtain kidney-specific mRNA. Control kidney mRNA showed retention of exon 15, while the mRNA from the patient's father confirmed evidence of heterozygous alternate splicing of exon 15 of NPHP3.

Analysis of RNA derived from hUREC allows for a comparison of kidney-specific and whole-blood RNA transcripts and for assessment of the effect on function of putative splice variants leading to end-stage kidney disease.

### Podocyturia: An emerging biomarker for kidney injury [^112efM66]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Low credibility.

Podocyte injury is an established hallmark of kidney disease progression. Podocyte loss is a widely proven hypothesis to explain, in part, glomerular damage. Regardless of the underlying kidney disease, the pathophysiologic processes frequently involve the glomerulus. A growing body of evidence considers that podocyte detachment (podocytopathy) and their presence in the urine (podocyturia) serve as hallmarks of glomerular disease progression. Developing new tools to monitor disease progression non-invasively is of major clinical importance. The detection of podocytes in the urine as a biomarker of disease progression would represent a significant achievement towards this goal. This review summarizes knowledge about podocyturia.

### Urine cytology discrepancies: Frequency, causes, and outcomes [^115GYmtq]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2007). Low credibility.

Although urine cytology is used for the early detection and surveillance of urothelial carcinoma, there has been little study of the frequency, causes, and outcomes of cytologic-histologic discrepancies. We obtained histologic follow-up in 361 (6.2%) of 5,785 voided, 124 (19.5%) of 636 lower tract instrumented, and 23 (33%) of 69 upper tract urinary cytologic specimens from one institution during a 2-year timeframe to determine diagnostic discrepancy frequency and outcomes.

Cytologic-histologic discrepancies were observed in 208 (40.9%) cases with histologic follow-up. The cause of discrepancy was interpretation in 35.1% and sampling in 63.0% of cases, respectively. Of all discrepancies, 101 (48.6%) resulted in minimal or mild harm, consisting mainly of repeated testing and diagnostic delays. Severe harm was never observed.

We conclude that screening and surveillance methods incorporating urine cytology are accurate in diagnosing urothelial cancer. However, the protocols result in potentially reducible errors that lead to unnecessary testing and diagnostic delays.

### Clinical implications of genitourinary embryology [^1179XwXQ]. Current Opinion in Urology (2009). Low credibility.

This review focuses on recent advances in the molecular embryology of the upper and lower urinary tract with an emphasis on clinical correlation to gain a better understanding of the mechanism of congenital anomalies.

- **Recent findings**: Normal morphogenesis of the kidney, ureteral bud differentiation, ureteropelvic junction formation, and bladder and trigone development are regulated by complex epithelial-mesenchymal signaling events. The failure of these signaling events to occur at specified times results in developmental anomalies. Immunohistochemical staining using animal and human tissues provides insights into the timing of various signaling events during development. Murine knockout models examine the role of various signaling molecules in genitourinary organogenesis. Lineage studies map the fate of cells in developing genitourinary tissues. Some of the most important findings include:
	- The role of bone morphogenetic protein-4 in the morphogenesis of the kidney
	- The importance of the mesenchyme associated with the proximal and distal segments of the ureter in directing differentiation
	- The role of bone morphogenetic protein-4 signaling in smooth muscle formation at the ureteropelvic junction
	- The predominant contribution of bladder smooth muscle in forming the trigone

- **Summary**: Recent studies have begun to unravel the complex molecular and cellular mechanisms for many common congenital anomalies of the genitourinary tract. A more precise understanding of these developmental events may provide insights into normal and abnormal development.

### The diagnostic accuracy of urine-based tests for bladder cancer varies greatly by patient [^112ZJbzZ]. BMC Urology (2016). Low credibility.

For all the above analyses, suspicious cystoscopies were considered positive since they will generally result in intervention (e.g. bladder biopsy). To determine whether the classification of suspicious cystoscopies dramatically affected our results, we repeated the analyses with suspicious cystoscopies classified as negative and found no significant difference in our results. This demonstrates that the performance of cytology and UroVysion FISH are not sensitive to how suspicious cystoscopies are classified. This stands in contrast to the large effect seen in cytology with a similar re-analysis that was mentioned above.

### Noninvasive diagnosis of the 3243A > G mitochondrial DNA mutation using urinary epithelial cells [^112GTLwi]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2004). Low credibility.

The 3243A > G mutation is one of the most frequently observed mutations of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and is associated with numerous clinical presentations, including mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS), progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO), and diabetes and deafness. The routine diagnosis of the 3243A > G mutation in blood is difficult, as mutation levels are known to decrease in this tissue over time, and in some patients, it may be absent. We have directly compared the levels of the 3243A > G mutation in skeletal muscle, blood, and urinary epithelial cells in 18 patients and observed a striking correlation between the mutation load in postmitotic muscle and urinary epithelium, a mitotic tissue. These data strongly support the use of urinary epithelial cells as the tissue of choice in the noninvasive diagnosis of the 3243A > G mutation.

### Urinary single-cell sequencing captures kidney injury and repair processes in human acute kidney injury [^1122TEv9]. Kidney International (2022). Low credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a major health issue, the outcome of which depends primarily on the damage and reparative processes of tubular epithelial cells. Mechanisms underlying AKI remain incompletely understood, specific therapies are lacking, and monitoring the course of AKI in clinical routine is confined to measuring urine output and plasma levels of filtration markers. Here, we demonstrate the feasibility and potential of a novel approach to assess the cellular and molecular dynamics of AKI by establishing a robust urine-to-single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) pipeline for excreted kidney cells via flow cytometry sorting.

We analyzed 42,608 single-cell transcriptomes of 40 urine samples from 32 patients with AKI and compared our data with reference material from human AKI post-mortem biopsies and published mouse data. We demonstrate that tubular epithelial cell transcriptomes mirror kidney pathology and reflect distinct injury and repair processes, including oxidative stress, inflammation, and tissue rearrangement. We also describe an AKI-specific abundant urinary excretion of adaptive progenitor-like cells. Thus, single-cell transcriptomics of kidney cells excreted in urine provides noninvasive, unprecedented insight into cellular processes underlying AKI, thereby opening novel opportunities for target identification, AKI sub-categorization, and monitoring of the natural disease course and interventions.

### Decoy cells detected in the urine of a patient with complex karyotype myelodysplastic neoplasms who underwent umbilical cord blood transplantation: A case report [^115eTcfU]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Low credibility.

The presence of decoy cells in urine, particularly alongside other clinical symptoms and laboratory findings, may indicate a BK virus infection. When decoy cells are detected in urine, it may also indicate complications related to kidney transplantation, such as BK virus-associated nephropathy. According to previous studies, the presence of polyomavirus-infected cells (decoy cells) in urine is a valuable non-invasive screening method. Decoy cells detected in the urine sediment of immunocompromised patients are usually caused by uncontrolled replication of polyomaviruses in the upper urinary tract. This case report discusses a patient with myelodysplastic neoplasms who underwent umbilical cord blood transplantation and had decoy cells detected in the urine.

### The urine sediment as a biomarker of kidney disease [^112VVUi1]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

The modern era of medicine has ushered in new diagnostic technologies to assist clinicians in evaluating patients with kidney disease. The development of automated urine analysis technology and centralized laboratory testing has unfortunately made the examination of urine sediment by physicians a rare event. At the same time, identifying novel urine biomarkers for kidney disease has become a research priority in nephrology, and the search for the "renal troponin" has progressed at a fast pace.

Despite this, urine sediment examination remains a time-honored test that provides a wealth of information about the patient's kidney condition and performs favorably as a urinary biomarker. It alerts clinicians to the presence of kidney disease and provides diagnostic information that often identifies the compartment of kidney injury. In addition, sediment findings may guide therapy and assist in prognostication.

As such, it is premature to abandon urine sediment examination. It may be more appropriate to combine urine sediment examination with new candidate biomarkers that enter clinical practice to create a "diagnostic panel" that provides clinicians with a useful battery of diagnostic tests. To accomplish this, we as nephrologists must encourage continued training and maintenance of competency in urine sediment examination.

### Using dipstick urinalysis to predict development of acute kidney injury in patients with COVID-19 [^113SkUFx]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Low credibility.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread rapidly across the globe, causing a worldwide pandemic associated with high morbidity and mortality in affected patients. Although primarily affecting the lungs, COVID-19 may also injure other organ systems. Kidney involvement is common and may range from isolated proteinuria to severe acute kidney injury (AKI). While the exact mechanism by which the virus induces kidney damage remains unclear, several processes have been postulated, including direct viral invasion of tubular epithelia, podocyte damage, cytokine storm, and complement activation. AKI is a major risk factor for mortality in patients hospitalized with COVID-19.

Simple predictive models that use readily available kidney laboratory parameters, such as urinary dipstick results and serum creatinine, are lacking. Such models would not only allow clinicians to easily prognosticate the development of AKI and the need for renal replacement therapy (RRT) but may also provide insight into the pathophysiology of AKI associated with COVID-19.

Although several studies reported proteinuria and hematuria in conjunction with COVID-19 infection, only a few evaluated differences in the incidence of proteinuria and hematuria on dipstick urinalysis in patients with AKI as compared to those without AKI. Even fewer studies investigated the association between proteinuria and hematuria with the development of AKI and the need for RRT. One study reported that a urine protein-to-creatinine ratio (UPCR) ≥ 1 g/g on admission was associated with an increased risk of requiring RRT.

### Urothelial cells may indicate underlying bacteriuria in pregnancy at term: a comparative study [^1112a3zY]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). Low credibility.

This was a prospective, cross-sectional, single-blinded comparative study of two urinary sampling methods in pregnant women at term gestation undergoing elective caesarean section. Patients were recruited between June and August 2015 from the obstetric labour ward theatre at a tertiary hospital in central London and gave written consent to an ethically approved study. The data were structured so that individual patients could not be identified.

A set of 41 questions was used to obtain a pertinent clinical, obstetric, and infection history. Further clinical data were gleaned from electronic patient notes and records. A lower urinary tract symptom (LUTS) profile was created using the "Artemis questionnaire", a detailed 49-item questionnaire divided into four categories: stress incontinence symptoms, overactive bladder symptoms, voiding symptoms, and pain symptoms (Additional file 1). This questionnaire is used in clinical practice by a tertiary chronic LUTS clinic as a tool to identify urinary infections and to assess treatment response in non-pregnant patients with chronic LUT symptoms. In this study, the LUTS profile was used as an assessment of bladder distress.

Two urine samples were obtained from each participant for paired comparison. First, participants were instructed to provide an MSU sample before entering the labour ward operating theatre. Verbal and written instructions were given to ensure an adequate clean-catch sample by (1) washing hands and cleaning the genital area with a hypoallergenic wipe to prevent local contamination; (2) parting the labia and ur.

### Urinary single-cell profiling captures the cellular diversity of the kidney [^116SxutH]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2021). Low credibility.

Microscopic analysis of urine sediment is probably the most commonly used diagnostic procedure in nephrology. The urinary cells, however, have not yet undergone careful unbiased characterization.

- **Methods**: Single-cell transcriptomic analysis was performed on 17 urine samples obtained from five subjects on two different occasions, using both spot and 24-hour urine collection. A pooled urine sample from multiple healthy individuals served as a reference control. In total, 23,082 cells were analyzed. Urinary cells were compared with human kidney and human bladder datasets to understand similarities and differences among the observed cell types.

- **Results**: Almost all kidney cell types can be identified in urine, such as podocytes, proximal tubules, loops of Henle, and collecting ducts, in addition to macrophages, lymphocytes, and bladder cells. The urinary cell-type composition was subject-specific and reasonably stable using different collection methods and over time. Urinary cells clustered with kidney and bladder cells, such as urinary podocytes with kidney podocytes, and principal cells of the kidney and urine, indicating their similarities in gene expression.

- **Conclusions**: A reference dataset for cells in human urine was generated. Single-cell transcriptomics enables detection and quantification of almost all types of cells in the kidney and urinary tract.

### Defining properly collected urine: Thresholds to improve the accuracy of urinalysis for microscopic hematuria evaluation in women [^114JkbXq]. The Journal of Urology (2022). High credibility.

Microscopic hematuria is one of the most common office consults for urologists. While revised guidelines have risk-stratified patients to reduce unnecessary screening, they do not provide guidance concerning specimen quality. We sought to define "properly collected" specimens using catheterized urine samples as a reference to improve the utility of hematuria screening in women.

- **Materials and methods**: We prospectively acquired same-visit voided and catheterized urine samples from 46 women referred for microscopic hematuria from September 2016 to March 2020. Characteristics of pre-referral urinalysis were compared to the matched specimens. True microscopic hematuria was defined as ≥ 3 red blood cells per high power field on catheterization.

- **Results**: Catheterized urinalyses had significantly fewer red blood and squamous epithelial cells in comparison to both referral urinalyses (p = 0.006, p = 0.001, respectively) and same-day void urinalyses (p = 0.02, p = 0.04, respectively). As no catheterized sample had > 2 squamous epithelial cells, we applied this squamous epithelial cell threshold to referral urinalyses for analysis. Addition of this criterion for "properly collected specimen" increased the positive predictive value of referral urinalyses from 46.1% to 68.8% for true microscopic hematuria. Fewer than 2 squamous epithelial cells with elevated RBC was a significant predictor for true microscopic hematuria (p = 0.003).

- **Conclusions**: Voided specimens in the urology clinic had significantly lower red blood cells than referral samples, indicating improved collection technique.

### Protein trafficking defects in inherited kidney diseases [^111Fe3Qp]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2014). Low credibility.

The nephron, the basic structural and functional unit of the kidney, is lined by different, highly differentiated polarized epithelial cells. Their concerted action modifies the composition of the glomerular ultrafiltrate through reabsorption and secretion of essential solutes to finally produce urine. The highly specialized properties of the different epithelial cell types of the nephron are remarkable and rely on the regulated delivery of specific proteins to their final subcellular localization. Hence, mutations affecting the sorting of individual proteins or inactivating the epithelial trafficking machinery have severe functional consequences causing disease.

The presence of mutations leading to protein trafficking defects is indeed a mechanism of pathogenesis seen in an increasing number of disorders, including about one-third of monogenic diseases affecting the kidney. In this review, we focus on representative diseases to discuss different molecular mechanisms that primarily lead to defective protein transport, such as endoplasmic reticulum retention, mistargeting, defective endocytosis, or degradation, eventually resulting in epithelial cell and kidney dysfunction.

- **Emphasis on reported mutations**: For each disease, we discuss the type of reported mutations, their molecular and cellular consequences, and possible strategies for therapeutic intervention. Particular emphasis is given to new and prospective therapies aimed at rescuing the trafficking defect at the basis of these conformational diseases.

### Urine based markers of urological malignancy [^1151eXb6]. The Journal of Urology (2001). Low credibility.

A number of urine-based markers have been and are being investigated for the diagnosis and prognostication of urological conditions. The majority of these markers have been evaluated in urological neoplasms, particularly bladder cancer. The diagnosis of bladder cancer currently relies on identifying malignant cells in the urine and subsequently visualizing the tumor via cystoscopy. This diagnosis is further confirmed by transurethral resection or biopsy. While urine cytology is specific, it is not sensitive, especially for detecting low-grade disease, prompting the search for more accurate markers of bladder cancer. In this review, we critically examine the results of studies evaluating various markers for bladder cancer.

The published literature on urine-based markers for all urological diseases, particularly bladder cancer, was identified using a MEDLINE search and critically analyzed. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of the various markers were compared. The benefit of using combined markers rather than a single marker was also analyzed from published reports.

Most published literature on urine-based markers for urological malignancies involves these markers for diagnosing and prognosticating bladder cancer. Hence, we focused mainly on urine-based markers in bladder cancer. Most markers appear to have an advantage over urine cytology in terms of sensitivity, especially for detecting low-grade, superficial tumors. However, most markers tend to be less specific than cytology.

### A revalidation and critique of assumptions about urinary sample collection methods, specimen quality and contamination [^115bpiEa]. International Urogynecology Journal (2020). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to measure contamination and substrate content for four different methods of obtaining urine samples. It also utilized the fact that urothelial cells can be distinguished from squamous epithelial cells by UP3 staining, which enabled measurement of contamination by the extra-urinary milieu compromising these various methods. The proportion of UP3-positive cells found in MSU samples was previously reported as 75% (Q1 = 68, Q3 = 78.5) by Horsley et al. This study had a similar outcome and extended this finding to three other sample collection methods.

Taken together with a wide body of literature demonstrating that urothelial cell shedding is a common innate immune response to infection, this study suggests that the widely held assumption that epithelial cells in a urine sample indicate contamination might need to be revised. The sample collection method did influence the absolute epithelial cell counts: the lowest number was observed with CSU samples (Fig. 1a) and the greatest number with natural void (Fig. 1c), during which the bladder contracts and collapses to eliminate bladder urinary substrate.

The Peezy device appeared to achieve its claim of obtaining a sample with fewer cells and very few uroplakin-negative cells. However, sediment trapped in the sponge valve of the Peezy device may counter-intuitively prove to be a richer substrate for microbiological investigation, as bacteria are known to adhere to and colonize the urothelial cells.

The rationale of midstream sampling has always been the avoidance of contamination. This was never properly t

### Influence of renal excretory function on the performance of urine based markers to detect bladder cancer [^116r6pZV]. The Journal of Urology (2012). Low credibility.

In hematuria cases, urine-based tests are used to detect bladder cancer. However, the diagnostic yield remains insufficient due to influencing variables, including urinary tract infections. Many patients are elderly with renal insufficiency and have proteinuria as an additional influencing factor. To our knowledge, no data are available on the accuracy of urine-based bladder cancer tests in conjunction with renal function.

Urine samples from 449 patients with hematuria and histology were included in the analysis. Cytology, fluorescence in situ hybridization, immunocytology, and nuclear matrix protein 22 assays were conducted. Renal function was classified as normal, impaired, or severely impaired based on serum creatinine, the glomerular filtration rate, and proteinuria. False-positive rates were statistically compared regarding renal function.

A total of 382 patients did not have bladder cancer. There was an increased false-positive rate for creatinine and the glomerular filtration rate. The nuclear matrix protein 22 test showed a 22.0% and 46.7% false-positive rate in the normal and limited function cohorts, respectively (p = 0.05). Similar trends were noted for proteinuria. Indeterminate significance was detected, separating those with severely impaired function for immunocytology and those in the normal group for fluorescence in situ hybridization (p = 0.08 and 0.06, respectively). Proteinuria was a significant factor for urine cytology, with increased false-positive results in the absence of urinary tract infection (p = 0.0017 and 0.05, respectively).

### Urothelial cells may indicate underlying bacteriuria in pregnancy at term: a comparative study [^116tERmz]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). Low credibility.

The uroplakin analysis refutes the assumption that epithelial cells are vulvo-vaginal skin contaminants. The epithelial cells seen in the urine were urothelial in origin and were often clue cells with closely associated bacteria. MSU samples had more clue cells and therefore a greater degree of bacterial invasion. There was no significant correlation between total cfu/ml and clue cells, but this is to be expected as intracellular bacteria will evade detection by routine culture means. Our findings confirm that colonization of urothelial cells by microbes leads to an innate immune response, as previously described by Horsley and colleagues. Mucosal surfaces are a common entry point for microbes, and in the context of urinary tract infections, uropathogenic bacteria invade the apical surface of the urothelium to create adherent surface biofilms or form intracellular bacterial colonies. The parasitized urothelial cell is subsequently exfoliated into the urine to encourage bacterial clearance, leading to the accumulation of these clue cells as sediment at the base of the bladder. While a transurethral catheter will pass through this deposit and sample the urine above, an MSU is more likely to achieve a greater sample of clue cells. It is conceivable that an ordinary void may achieve even more by including the first part of the stream.

Urine is increasingly recognized to have its own diverse microbiome, and standard culture methods only capture a small fraction of this living community. Imbalances within this healthy microbiota are associated with factors such as age and body mass index.

### Urine flow cytometry in older adults urinary tract infection diagnosis: is it time to reevaluate thresholds for men and women [^11796KkM]? BMC Geriatrics (2025). High credibility.

This study included adult patients aged 65 years or older hospitalized at the Besancon University Hospital between May 2024 and October 2024 with a urine culture obtained within the first 48 hours of hospitalization. Urine samples obtained midstream or collected via in-out catheterization were accepted. Patients were excluded if (1) they had an indwelling catheter for more than 24 hours, (2) they were undergoing antibiotic treatment prior to the urine culture being performed, and (3) they had been hospitalized in the 3 previous months. Patients were prospectively included on a daily basis. Clinical and biological data were collected from the patients' medical records by two investigators (A.B and E.C.).

Prior to the urine culture, the urine dipstick could be performed in an emergency setting using a dipstick with an automatic reading system (CLINITEK Status +, Siemens). Urine culture and urine cytology were performed as part of routine patient management. Urine cytology was performed using the Sysmex UF-4000 automated system (Sysmex, Kobe, Japan) according to the manufacturer's recommendations, which allowed counting of urinary white blood cells, bacteria, squamous cells, non-secretory cells (transitional cells and renal tubular cells), and atypical cells. Ten µl of urine was cultured on a urine chromogenic agar plate (URI4 urine, Bio-Rad, Marnes-la-Coquette, France) and incubated at 35°C for 24 to 48 hours according to French recommendations. Bacterial identification was performed using MALDI-TOF MS technology.

### Urine flow cytometry in older adults urinary tract infection diagnosis: Is it time to reevaluate thresholds for men and women [^112a6o37]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Low credibility.

We aimed to evaluate Sysmex parameters to predict urine culture positivity. Both a high UBC and a high U-WBC were associated with a positive urine culture (p > 0.99), squamous cells (p > 0.99), non-secretory cells (p > 0.99), and transitional cells (p > 0.99). The ROC curve AUC was above 0.8 for UBC (AUC = 0.923 [0.895–0.950]) and for U-WBC (AUC = 0.853 [0.819–0.888]). The AUC for UBC was significantly higher than the AUC for U-WBC (p < 0.001). The optimal threshold defined by the Youden index was 1176 bacteria/µL, giving a sensitivity of 79.17% [72.41–84.62], specificity of 95.83% [92.86–97.6], LR- of 0.22 [0.21–0.23], and LR + of 19.0 [16.07–22.46]. No UBC threshold was able to achieve an LR- < 0.1.

### Urinary squamous epithelial cells do not accurately predict urine culture contamination, but may predict urinalysis performance in predicting bacteriuria [^116iG1BJ]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

The presence of squamous epithelial cells (SECs) has been advocated to identify urinary contamination despite a paucity of evidence supporting this practice. We sought to determine the value of using quantitative SECs as a predictor of urinalysis contamination.

- **Methods**: Retrospective cross-sectional study of adults (≥ 18 years old) presenting to a tertiary academic medical center who had urinalysis with microscopy and urine culture performed. Patients with missing or implausible demographic data were excluded (2.5% of total sample). The primary analysis aimed to determine an SEC threshold that predicted urine culture contamination using receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve analysis. The a priori secondary analysis explored how demographic variables (age, sex, body mass index) may modify the SEC test performance and whether SECs impacted traditional urinalysis indicators of bacteriuria.

- **Results**: A total of 19,328 records were included. ROC curve analysis demonstrated that SEC count was a poor predictor of urine culture contamination (area under the ROC curve = 0.680, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.671 to 0.689). In secondary analysis, the positive likelihood ratio (LR+) of predicting bacteriuria via urinalysis among noncontaminated specimens was 4.98 (95% CI = 4.59 to 5.40) in the absence of SECs, but the LR+ fell to 2.35 (95% CI = 2.17 to 2.54) for samples with more than 8 SECs/low-powered field (lpf). In an independent validation cohort, urinalysis samples with fewer than 8 SECs/lpf predicted bacteriuria better (sensitivity = 75%, specificity = 84%).

### Is cytology required for a hematuria evaluation [^115raSWN]. The Journal of Urology (2004). Low credibility.

The value of urine cytology in evaluating patients with hematuria remains controversial. The American Urological Association Best Practice Policy on asymptomatic microscopic hematuria recommends cytology only in patients with risk factors for transitional cell carcinoma (TCC). This study evaluated how often urine cytology yielded supportive or unique information that led to the diagnosis of transitional cell carcinoma, the cost of that information, and whether it would have been obtained using the best practice policy.

Between March 1976 and June 1985, 1,000 sequential patients with one episode of gross hematuria or microscopic hematuria, defined as greater than three red blood cells per high power field on two of three properly collected urinalyses, were evaluated according to a standard protocol in a closed-panel health care system in the state of Hawaii. These records were reviewed to determine if urine cytology yielded supportive or unique information that led to the diagnosis of TCC.

In four patients, positive urine cytology was the sole finding supporting a TCC diagnosis. Urine cytology had a sensitivity of 55% and a specificity of 99.3%. The cost of a cytology result that yielded unique information was 8,367 US dollars, using the 2002 Medicare reimbursement schedule.

Urine cytology can have an important role in the evaluation of hematuria. The American Urological Society Best Practice Policy, using risk factors to select patients for urine cytology, would have captured the four patients for whom cytology was the key finding.
