## Question

What are the effects of salbutamol to a patient with heart failure

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the effects of salbutamol (albuterol) in patients with heart failure and how to weigh benefits versus risks in this context. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacology and potential cardiac effects of salbutamol. Then, I should review the clinical evidence for acute versus chronic use in heart failure. Next, I will examine dose-related risks, especially in HFrEF, and consider mechanistic explanations. After that, I should integrate guideline positions and practical recommendations. Finally, I will synthesize a cautious, clinically actionable approach with monitoring and alternatives, making sure I verify each claim against the best available sources as I go.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacology and expected cardiac effects. Salbutamol is a selective β2-adrenergic agonist that relaxes bronchial smooth muscle, but it has clinically relevant β1 activity at higher doses, which can increase heart rate and myocardial oxygen demand; it also lowers serum potassium and can increase QT dispersion, all of which are concerning in heart failure physiology [^113xmD9X] [^116Ss43c] [^1136PvB8] [^112MvEU2] [^115Y4JpC]. Wait, let me verify the potassium effect and repolarization changes: multiple studies and reviews document a mean potassium drop around 0.5 mmol/L and increased QT dispersion with β2-agonist exposure, reinforcing arrhythmic risk in susceptible patients [^1136PvB8] [^115Y4JpC].

> Next, I should review acute effects in heart failure. Small studies and reviews suggest that inhaled β2-agonists can transiently improve pulmonary mechanics and may even enhance pulmonary vascular reserve in HFpEF without immediately worsening left-sided filling pressures, but these are hemodynamic or physiologic endpoints, not hard outcomes, so I need to be careful not to over-interpret them [^117PPEWG] [^115cWFTX]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: improved pulmonary vascular resistance during exercise is not the same as improved survival or fewer hospitalizations, and the trials were small and short-term, so clinical translation is uncertain [^117PPEWG] [^115cWFTX].

> I will now examine chronic and high-dose exposure data, because that is where harm signals emerge. Observational cohorts in patients with established heart failure show a dose-related increase in heart failure hospitalizations with inhaled β2-agonists: roughly 1.8-fold with 1–2 canisters/month and about 2.1-fold with ≥ 3 canisters/month, with similar trends for mortality in those with LV systolic dysfunction, which is hard to ignore despite the observational design [^116exo7L] [^1116aSwB] [^114qnJyK]. Wait, I should double-check consistency: multiple independent datasets replicate the dose–response pattern, strengthening the case for causality even if confounding cannot be fully excluded [^116exo7L] [^1116aSwB] [^114qnJyK].

> Let me consider mechanistic plausibility to ensure internal consistency. Chronic β-adrenergic stimulation increases myocardial oxygen consumption, promotes arrhythmias via calcium overload and repolarization heterogeneity, and can accelerate β-receptor desensitization, which undermines both endogenous and exogenous adrenergic signaling. In heart failure, where neurohormonal activation is already maladaptive, this can worsen energetics and precipitate decompensation, aligning with the epidemiologic signals seen with frequent β2-agonist use [^113nwHdf] [^1161Ber2] [^112ZdegJ]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost implied that β-blockers directly counter salbutamol's bronchodilation; that would be imprecise — β-blockers reduce airway smooth muscle β2-mediated bronchodilation, but cardioselective agents at usual doses are generally compatible with COPD care and should not be withheld when indicated for HF, so I should correct that nuance here [^114UbfqK] [^113Xchdb].

> Next, I should review guideline positions to anchor practice. Contemporary HF guidelines emphasize disease-modifying therapy with β-blockers, ACEi/ARNI, MRAs, and SGLT2 inhibitors, and they caution against routine inotrope use outside of bridge or palliative contexts. None endorse chronic β2-agonist therapy for HF management, and β2-agonists are flagged in drug safety statements as potentially worsening HF, particularly with higher inhaled doses or systemic exposure [^117KByBa] [^116exo7L] [^114CQVuj]. I need to ensure I'm precise: guidelines do not prohibit inhaled β2-agonists for coexisting obstructive lung disease, but they advise caution, prefer anticholinergics when feasible, and prioritize optimization of HF therapy and objective confirmation of airflow limitation before escalating bronchodilators [^1168jRCZ] [^112gDe4p] [^116exo7L] [^114UbfqK].

> But wait, what about special contexts like ARDS or HFpEF where β2-agonists might help pulmonary mechanics? The ALTA and BALTI-2 trials showed no benefit and possible harm with inhaled or IV β2-agonists in ARDS, with BALTI-2 terminated early for excess mortality, underscoring that systemic β2 effects can outweigh theoretical pulmonary benefits in critically ill patients; likewise, the HFpEF hemodynamic study was small and not designed to assess clinical outcomes, so it cannot justify routine use [^116R8ZBT] [^111yRCQe] [^115cWFTX]. Hold on, I should verify that these ARDS findings are not directly generalizable to ambulatory HF, but they reinforce the principle that β2-agonists can impose clinically meaningful cardiovascular stress in vulnerable patients [^116R8ZBT] [^111yRCQe].

> I should now translate this into practical recommendations. For patients with coexisting COPD or asthma and HF, confirm obstructive physiology objectively and, if possible, favor anticholinergic bronchodilators as first-line maintenance; if a β2-agonist is necessary, use the lowest effective dose, prefer MDI over nebulizer to limit systemic exposure, monitor heart rate and rhythm, check electrolytes periodically, and reassess HF status at each visit for deterioration or weight gain [^112gDe4p] [^1168jRCZ] [^1136PvB8] [^116exo7L]. I need to ensure I'm not overstating absolutes: guidelines do not mandate avoiding β2-agonists entirely, but they do advise minimizing exposure and vigilance for dose-related harm, especially in HFrEF [^114CQVuj] [^116exo7L].

> Let me reconsider the balance of benefits and risks to avoid overgeneralization. Short-term, judicious inhaled salbutamol can relieve bronchospasm with modest hemodynamic effects in stable HF, but frequent or high-dose use tracks with more HF hospitalizations and adverse cardiovascular events in observational cohorts, and systemic β2 effects can precipitate tachyarrhythmias, ischemia, and hypokalemia, which are particularly undesirable in HF. Therefore, the default should be caution, not prohibition, with shared decision-making and close monitoring [^117PPEWG] [^1116aSwB] [^114qnJyK] [^114N5Wqd] [^1136PvB8]. I should double-check that I've emphasized the dose–response relationship clearly, because limiting cumulative monthly exposure is a key modifiable factor [^1116aSwB] [^114qnJyK].

> Final synthesis: salbutamol exerts clinically important cardiovascular effects in heart failure patients, including increased heart rate, arrhythmic potential, hypokalemia, and higher myocardial oxygen demand. Acute inhaled use may transiently improve pulmonary mechanics without clear outcome benefit, whereas chronic or high-dose exposure is associated with dose-related increases in HF hospitalizations and adverse cardiovascular events, especially in HFrEF. Therefore, use the lowest effective dose only when clearly indicated, prefer anticholinergics when feasible, monitor closely, and prioritize guideline-directed HF therapies that improve survival [^117PPEWG] [^116exo7L] [^116VbNhd] [^1168jRCZ].

Salbutamol can cause **tachycardia, arrhythmias, and hypokalemia** in heart failure patients, potentially worsening symptoms and increasing risk of decompensation [^114N5Wqd] [^116exo7L]. Chronic or high-dose use is linked to **increased hospitalizations and mortality** in HFrEF, so it should be used cautiously and only when clearly indicated [^116exo7L] [^114qnJyK]. If needed, use the lowest effective dose, monitor ECG and electrolytes, and avoid systemic routes; consider anticholinergics or LABAs as safer alternatives [^116exo7L] [^1168jRCZ].

## Pharmacological effects of salbutamol relevant to heart failure

Salbutamol is a selective β2-agonist that causes bronchodilation but also has **off-target β1 effects** and systemic absorption, producing cardiovascular effects relevant to heart failure:

- **Positive chronotropic and inotropic effects**: β1-mediated increases in heart rate and contractility raise myocardial oxygen demand, which can worsen ischemia and arrhythmias in heart failure [^116Ss43c] [^111poiYE].

- **Arrhythmogenesis**: β-agonists can precipitate sinus tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, and ventricular arrhythmias, which are common in heart failure and increase morbidity and mortality [^114N5Wqd] [^115Y4JpC].

- **Hypokalemia**: β2-agonists shift potassium intracellularly, causing hypokalemia that increases arrhythmic risk, especially with diuretics or digoxin [^1136PvB8].

- **Vasodilation**: Peripheral vasodilation can cause reflex sympathetic activation and hypotension, potentially worsening heart failure symptoms [^113je9HQ].

---

## Clinical evidence of salbutamol effects in heart failure patients

### Acute effects

In acute settings, salbutamol can cause **transient hemodynamic and respiratory improvements** but also adverse cardiovascular effects:

- **Hemodynamic effects**: Acute inhaled salbutamol can modestly improve pulmonary function and hemodynamics in heart failure, but may also cause tachycardia and arrhythmias [^117PPEWG].

- **Arrhythmias**: Case reports and studies describe ventricular arrhythmias and myocardial ischemia with salbutamol, particularly in susceptible patients [^1136PvB8] [^115S38sQ].

- **Hypokalemia**: Acute salbutamol use can cause significant hypokalemia, increasing arrhythmic risk [^1136PvB8].

---

### Chronic effects

Chronic or repeated salbutamol use in heart failure is associated with **harmful outcomes**:

- **Increased hospitalizations**: Observational studies show a dose-related increase in heart failure hospitalizations with inhaled β2-agonists, including salbutamol [^1116aSwB] [^114qnJyK].

- **Increased mortality**: Chronic β2-agonist use is associated with higher mortality in heart failure patients, particularly those with reduced ejection fraction [^114qnJyK] [^112zoJuE].

- **Worsening heart failure**: Chronic β-agonist exposure can exacerbate heart failure symptoms and lead to clinical deterioration [^116exo7L] [^114CQVuj].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines and expert consensus provide **clear recommendations** on salbutamol use in heart failure:

- **Avoidance of chronic use**: Chronic or high-dose salbutamol should be avoided in heart failure patients due to increased risk of hospitalization and mortality [^116exo7L] [^114qnJyK].

- **Use lowest effective dose**: If salbutamol is necessary, use the lowest effective dose, monitor closely for adverse effects, and avoid systemic routes [^114CQVuj].

- **Alternative bronchodilators**: Anticholinergic bronchodilators (e.g. ipratropium) or long-acting β2-agonists (LABAs) may be safer alternatives in heart failure patients with coexisting respiratory disease [^1168jRCZ].

- **Monitoring**: Regular monitoring of heart rate, rhythm, electrolytes, and clinical status is recommended when salbutamol is used in heart failure patients [^115S38sQ].

---

## Clinical scenarios and patient populations at increased risk

Certain heart failure patients are at **particularly high risk** of adverse effects from salbutamol:

- **Reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF)**: Patients with HFrEF are at increased risk of arrhythmias, hospitalizations, and mortality with salbutamol use [^114qnJyK] [^116exo7L].

- **Arrhythmias**: Patients with pre-existing arrhythmias or conduction disorders are at heightened risk of salbutamol-induced arrhythmias [^notfound].

- **Hypokalemia**: Patients on diuretics or with baseline hypokalemia are at increased risk of salbutamol-induced hypokalemia and arrhythmias [^notfound].

## Summary of salbutamol effects in heart failure patients

| **Effect** | **Acute use** | **Chronic use** |
|-|-|-|
| Positive chronotropy | Yes | Yes |
| Positive inotropy | Yes | Yes |
| Arrhythmias | Yes | Yes |
| Hypokalemia | Yes | Yes |
| Hospitalizations | Possible | Increased |
| Mortality | Possible | Increased |

---

Salbutamol can provide short-term bronchodilation but carries **significant cardiovascular risks** in heart failure, including tachycardia, arrhythmias, hypokalemia, and increased hospitalizations and mortality with chronic use. Use the lowest effective dose, monitor closely, and consider alternatives when possible.

### Inhaled β-agonist does not modify sympathetic activity in patients with COPD [^113g5MAD]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Sympathetic activation

MSNA was increased in our patients and as high or even higher as compared to previous studies in COPD patients. In a setting of increased MSNA, previous interventional studies using oxygen or slow breathing demonstrated a significant decrease in MSNA. However, in the present study no effect of the intervention on MSNA was noted. For more insight into the effects of inhaled β-agonists on sympathetic activity it is helpful to discuss older work on intravenous administration of catecholamines. Adrenaline infusion (with α1-receptor activity causing vasoconstriction and β-receptor activity) did cause an increase in MSNA. Intravenous dobutamine (a predominant β1-agonist and weak β2-agonist without relevant α1 activity) did not increase MSNA in heart failure patients or matched controls. While there was no effect on heart rate or blood pressure in heart failure patients, healthy matched controls experienced an increase in heart rate but not blood pressure. In contrast, in an unmatched group of younger healthy subjects blood pressure increased, and consecutively MSNA decreased following dobutamine infusion. In another study intravenous dobutamine reduced cardiac norepinephrine spillover in patients with heart failure but not in subjects with normal ejection fraction. Similarly, in healthy young subjects the increase in heart rate following salmeterol was explained mainly by a decrease in total peripheral resistance. Our study contributes to the understanding of these data by the comprehensive evaluation of respiration, cardiovascular function and MSNA: In our older patients with increased sympathetic activity we did not observe a change in blood pressure or MSNA following salmeterol.

### Inotropes and β-blockers: is there a need for new guidelines? [^112gjPAe]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2001). Low credibility.

Beta-adrenergic blocking agents are standard treatment for patients with mild-to-moderate heart failure. When patients receiving beta-blockers decompensate they often need treatment with a positive inotropic agent. The beta-agonist dobutamine may not produce much increase in cardiac output during full-dose beta-blocker treatment and may increase systemic vascular resistance via alpha-adrenergic stimulation. In contrast, phosphodiesterase inhibitors (PDEIs) such as milrinone or enoximone retain full hemodynamic effects during complete beta-blockade because the site of action of PDEIs is beyond the beta-adrenergic receptor and because beta-blockade reverses some of the desensitization phenomena that account for the attenuation of PDEI response in heart failure related to upregulation in G(alphai). Inotrope-requiring subjects with decompensated heart failure who are undergoing long-term therapy with beta-blocking agents should be treated with a type III-specific PDEI, not a beta-agonist such as dobutamine.

Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2021). High credibility.

Therapies for heart failure — agent definitions are provided for inotropes/pressors used in practice: Milrinone is a phosphodiesterase 3 inhibitor that works to increase the heart's contractility and decrease pulmonary vascular resistance; Dobutamine is a direct-acting inotropic agent whose primary activity results from stimulation of the beta receptors of the heart while producing comparatively mild chronotropic, hypertensive, arrhythmogenic, and vasodilative effects; Norepinephrine is a sympathomimetic amine that increases blood pressure and enhances ventricular contractility; Epinephrine, when injected into an intravenous fluid solution, increases blood pressure, coronary artery pressure, thereby promoting increased coronary blood flow and ventricular contractility; and Dopamine at low doses acts through the sympathetic nervous system to increase heart muscle contraction force and heart rate, thereby increasing cardiac output and blood pressure, while at higher doses, causes vasoconstriction that further increases blood pressure.

### Takotsubo cardiomyopathy with use of salbutamol nebulisation and aminophylline infusion in a patient with acute asthma exacerbation [^112NkpYz]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, apical ballooning syndrome or stress-induced cardiomyopathy is characterised by transient left ventricular dysfunction, mimicking myocardial infarction in the absence of obstructive coronary artery disease or acute plaque rupture on coronary angiography. The exact mechanism of myocardial dysfunction in Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is unknown; however, due to its association with physical and emotional stress, it is postulated that catecholamines play a central role in its pathogenesis. We present a case of a patient who was admitted with acute asthma exacerbation and was treated with β-2 agonist nebulisation and intravenous aminophylline. During her hospital stay she developed Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.

### Why has positive inotropy failed in chronic heart failure? Lessons from prior inotrope trials [^1121UsfE]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2019). Medium credibility.

Medical treatment of patients in prior trials did not protect them from sudden cardiac death

As displayed in Table 3 14, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 48, 53, 54, 56, 57 most of the landmark trials that tested positive inotropes in heart failure had very low usage of key therapies — β‐blockers and implantable cardioverter‐defibrillators (ICDs) — that are known to protect heart failure patients against sudden cardiac death, the mode of death most commonly provoked by these medications. In fact, many of these trials listed β‐blocker use as an exclusion criterion as they occurred prior to when these medications were found to be of benefit in heart failure. Whereas the actual prevalence of ICD use is unclear from most of the published manuscripts, it generally occurred prior to the landmark trials showing benefit of these devices for primary and secondary prevention of sudden death in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. 92 Furthermore, usage of additional neurohormonal agents was low in these trials, potentially leading to even less protection from the adverse effects of adverse remodelling. Finally, a large portion of patients in positive inotrope trials were on concomitant digoxin, often on higher doses than are currently considered therapeutic. Given the mechanistic intersections between digoxin and cardiac inotropes, it is plausible that concomitant usage might have had a negative synergistic effect. 93 These have been proposed as reasons as to why contemporary outcomes from inotrope usage are better that those seen in trials. 92, 93 In addition, a recent meta‐analysis has suggested that ambulatory inotrope infusions in advanced stage D heart failure may improve NYHA functional class without negatively impacting survival. 94

### Reducing the risk of sudden death in heart failure with β-blockers [^113B5YMC]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Heart failure (HF) is a serious cardiovascular syndrome that affects nearly 5 million people in the United States. A review of clinical data demonstrates that sudden cardiac death (SCD) accounts for approximately one-third of all HF deaths. This fatal outcome typically involves an unexpected electrical event leading to sustained cardiac arrhythmias resulting in cardiovascular collapse.

Methods and Results

A systematic review of the literature was performed to serve as the basis for this review. Factors contributing directly to incidence of SCD in the HF population may include significant remodeling of the left ventricle (hypertrophy, dilation, and fibrosis) in addition to increased sympathetic activation. Using specific therapies to limit these mechanisms are beneficial in the HF patient by preventing SCD. Beta-blockers play a key role in the prevention of SCD for patients with HF by limiting the effects of circulating norepinephrine and by reducing left ventricular remodeling.

Conclusions

This review outlines the potential mechanisms and contributing factors of SCD in patients with HF and the impact of beta-blocker usage in the prevention of this fatal outcome for this growing patient population.

### The β-adrenergic agonist albuterol improves pulmonary vascular reserve in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^115cWFTX]. Circulation Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Pulmonary vascular resistance fails to decrease appropriately during exercise in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Interventions that enhance pulmonary vasodilation might be beneficial in this cohort but could also worsen left atrial hypertension, exacerbating lung congestion. Intravenous β-agonists reduce pulmonary vascular resistance but are not suitable for chronic use.

Objective

We hypothesized that the inhaled β-adrenergic agonist albuterol would improve pulmonary vasodilation during exercise in patients with HFpEF, without increasing left heart filling pressures.

Methods and Results

We performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial testing the effects of inhaled albuterol on resting and exercise hemodynamics in subjects with HFpEF using high-fidelity micromanometer catheters and expired gas analysis. The primary end point was pulmonary vascular resistance during exercise. Subjects with HFpEF (n = 30) underwent resting and exercise hemodynamic assessment and were then randomized 1:1 to inhaled, nebulized albuterol or placebo. Rest and exercise hemodynamic testing was then repeated. Albuterol improved the primary end point of exercise pulmonary vascular resistance as compared with placebo (-0.6 ± 0.5 versus +0.1 ± 0.7 WU; P = 0.003). Albuterol enhanced cardiac output reserve and right ventricular pulmonary artery coupling, reduced right atrial and pulmonary artery pressures, improved pulmonary artery compliance, and enhanced left ventricular transmural distending pressure (all P < 0.01), with no increase in pulmonary capillary hydrostatic pressures.

Conclusions

Albuterol improves pulmonary vascular reserve in patients with HFpEF without worsening left heart congestion. Further study is warranted to evaluate the chronic efficacy of β-agonists in HFpEF and other forms of pulmonary hypertension.

### Beneficial association of β-blocker therapy on recovery from severe acute heart failure treatment: data from the survival of patients with acute heart failure in need of intravenous inotropic support trial [^111V1U7V]. Critical Care Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Objectives

Beta-blocker therapy is recommended for most patients with chronic heart failure, although such therapy may be discontinued or reduced during hospitalizations. The aim is to determine whether β-blocker use at study entry and/or at discharge has an impact on 31- and 180-day survival.

Design

Survival of Patients With Acute Heart Failure in Need of Intravenous Inotropic Support study was designed as a randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, multi-center study.

Setting

Multinational.

Patients

A total of 1,327 critically ill patients hospitalized with low-output heart failure in need of inotropic therapy.

Intervention

Levosimendan versus dobutamine.

Measurements

All-cause mortality at 31 and 180 days in patients who survived initial hospitalization with/without β-blocker use at entry and/or at discharge.

Results

Patients on β-blockers at entry and at discharge had significantly lower 31-day (p < .0001) and 180-day (p < .0001) mortality compared to patients without β-blockers use at both time points. The association was robust when adjusted for age and co-morbidities (p = .006 at 31 days; p = .003 at 180 days).

Conclusions

Those results strongly suggest, in severe acutely decompensated heart failure patients, admitted on β-blockers, to continue on them at discharge.

### Why has positive inotropy failed in chronic heart failure? Lessons from prior inotrope trials [^116gW6pr]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2019). Medium credibility.

Adrenergic agents

Dobutamine was the first inotrope developed, but it has never been formally compared with placebo in a clinical trial of patients with heart failure. Its safety and efficacy were extrapolated from a subgroup analysis of the Flolan International Randomized Survival Trial (FIRST) study (published in 1997) that randomized 471 patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) class IIIB–IV symptoms to epoprostenol (prostacyclin) infusion vs. standard care. 60 The trial was terminated early because of a strong trend toward decreased survival among patients treated with epoprostenol. Furthermore, epoprostenol therapy was not associated with improvement in distance walked or quality of life measures. A post‐hoc analysis of this study compared 80 patients who were treated with and without dobutamine at time of randomization. The investigators found that dobutamine use was associated with a higher 6‐month mortality rate. While the increased mortality persisted despite adjustment for baseline differences, the dobutamine group notably included a sicker population, which may have influenced the results. Other studies where intermittent dobutamine infusion was used showed no improvement in clinical class and increased mortality. 61 This has led to the conclusion that dobutamine use might lead to harm in patients with advanced symptomatic heart failure. 46

Xamoterol, a β 1 ‐selective partial adrenergic agonist, demonstrated favourable haemodynamic and symptomatic improvement in initial studies but was found to have more than a twofold increased risk of death over placebo when evaluated in a large randomized trial published in 1990. Specifically, 516 patients with NYHA class III–IV symptoms despite treatment with diuretics and angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors were randomized in a 2:1 fashion to xamoterol 200 mg or placebo twice daily for 13 weeks. There was no difference between the treatments in exercise duration or total work done. Compared to a rate of 3.7% in the placebo arm, 9.1% of patients in the xamoterol group died within 100 days of randomization. 41 Ibopamine is an oral dopaminergic agonist, which also has some α‐adrenergic and β‐adrenergic activity. 62 It was shown to improve heart failure symptoms in the Prospective Randomized Study of Ibopamine on Mortality and Efficacy (PRIME). 63 This led to the PRIME II trial that was stopped early because of a 26% increase in mortality among patients in the ibopamine group. 44

### Pharmacological treatments in ARDS; a state-of-the-art update [^116f8izv]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

β-adrenergic agonists

Alveolar edema is a central feature of ARDS, contributing to limitation of gaseous exchange and ventilatory failure. Experimental data suggest β-adrenergic agonists could accelerate alveolar fluid clearance, as well as provide cytoprotection, increased surfactant secretion and decreased endothelial permeability.

Based on the proposed effect upon alveolar fluid clearance, the β-Agonist Lung Injury Trial (BALTI) randomized 60 patients to IV salbutamol or placebo for seven days. In this small, single center study, salbutamol therapy significantly reduced extravascular lung water at Day 7 compared with placebo (Table 1).

Subsequently, two large multi-center, randomized placebo-controlled trials were initiated. The first American study, ALTA (Albuterol Treatment for Acute Lung Injury), enrolled 282 patients with ALI, but failed to demonstrate a difference in ventilator-free days between those receiving inhaled β-agonist therapy and those given placebo, and was stopped early as it breached the futility boundary (Table 1). In the most severely ill, as defined by the presence of shock at randomization, length of stay was significantly increased, suggesting worse outcome in this sub-group.

BALTI-2 was a concurrent UK multi-center study investigating intravenous salbutamol in patients with ARDS, but was terminated early due to excess mortality in the group receiving IV salbutamol (Table 1).

On the basis of these larger trials, β-agonists should be avoided in patients with ALI. It is hypothesized that β-agonists may have a harmful cardiac effect, stimulating tachyarrhythmias and cardiac ischemia, resulting in a poorer outcome.

Neutrophil elastase inhibitors

Neutrophil elastase (NE) is a serine protease found in neutrophil granules and has a range of physiological effects, including anti-microbial actions and modification of tissue repair and inflammation. Excessive NE is capable of degrading endothelial basement membrane, and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of ARDS. Following a positive study in Japan, silvelestat, a neutrophil elastase inhibitor, was investigated in an international randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center phase III trial (STRIVE) (Table 1). The study was stopped prematurely due to an increase in 180-day all-cause mortality.

A more recent meta-analysis of eight clinical trials (including STRIVE) investigating silvelestat has shown it to have no effect on short-term mortality, and a worse outcome for 180-day mortality (Risk Ratio (RR) 1.27, CI 1.00 to 1.62).

### Impact of baseline β-blocker use on inotrope response and clinical outcomes in cardiogenic shock: a subgroup analysis of the DOREMI trial [^112cieci]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

In the DOREMI trial, patients with CS were randomly assigned to receive dobutamine or milrinone, the two approved inotropic agents in North America. Milrinone is a phosphodiesterase-III inhibitor and dobutamine is a synthetic catecholamine with beta-1 and beta-2 receptor agonism. In patients with acute decompensated heart failure, the inotropic effects of dobutamine have been shown to be dependent on the degree of occupancy of the beta-receptor and on the activity of the beta-adrenergic signal transduction mechanisms. 11,15 As a result, the use of a phosphodiesterase-III inhibitor has been suggested in lieu of beta-agonists for patients who had been treated with BBs. 16 Our study is the first to evaluate the impact of baseline BB on clinical and hemodynamic parameters and contrary to traditional teaching, we found little difference. While vasoactive-inotrope score was mildly greater among BB patients treated with dobutamine compared to milrinone, there was no difference in heart rate, mean arterial pressure or clinical outcomes. Moreover, there was no difference between BB and non-BB vasoactive-inotrope scores in those randomized to dobutamine. Contrasting with patients with decompensated heart failure, in the shock state with hypotension there is increased sympathetic tone and catecholamine levels in a compensatory response to maintain cardiac output, 17 which may mitigate the BB effect. Accordingly, selection of inotropic agent could reasonably be based on physician comfort and hemodynamic goals of the patient irrespective of baseline BB use.

### Acute heart failure is a malignant process: but we can induce remission [^1165xUdM]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Similar results have been seen with inotropic agents. In the OPTIME‐CHF (Outcomes of a Prospective Trial of Intravenous Milrinone for Exacerbation of Chronic Heart Failure), patients with an acute exacerbation of chronic HF were randomly assigned to receive a 48‐hour infusion of either milrinone, 0.5 μg/kg per minute initially, or saline placebo. Both groups had the same reduction in HF scale score from baseline to day 3. The milrinone and placebo groups did not differ significantly for in‐hospital mortality (3.8% versus 2.3%; P = 0.19), 60‐day mortality (10.3% versus 8.9%; P = 0.41), or the composite incidence of death or readmission (35.0% versus 35.3%; P = 0.92). The SURVIVE (Survival of Patients With Acute Heart Failure in Need of Intravenous Inotropic Support) studywas a randomized, double‐blind trial comparing the efficacy and safety of intravenous levosimendan with dobutamine in patients hospitalized with acute decompensated HF. Although in the levosimendan group there was a greater decrease in B‐type natriuretic peptide level at 24 hours that persisted through 5 days compared with the dobutamine group, there was not any difference between the groups in the secondary end points: all‐cause mortality at 31 days, number of days alive and out of the hospital, patient global assessment, and patient assessment of dyspnea at 24 hours. All‐cause mortality at 180 days occurred in 26% of patients in the levosimendan group and 28% of patients in the dobutamine group (P = 0.40). In another phase 3 trial of levosimendan, the REVIVE (Randomized Multicenter Evaluation of Intravenous Levosimendan Efficacy) trial, the short‐term effects of levosimendan were assessed. Patient dyspnea improvement was more pronounced in the levosimendan group at 6, 24, and 48 hours and at 3 and 5 days, and the same improvement was seen for the patient global assessment. However, levosimendan was associated with more frequent hypotension and cardiac arrhythmias during the infusion period, and there was a numerically higher risk of early death across the 2 trials that persisted at day 90 (49 of 350 on a regimen of levosimendan versus 40 of 350 on a regimen of placebo). In the ATOMIC‐AHF (Acute Treatment With Omecamtiv Mecarbil to Increase Contractility in Acute Heart Failure) trial, omecamtiv mecarbil did not improve dyspnea relief compared with placebo or any of the secondary outcomes studied. All‐cause rehospitalization within 30 days occurred in 12.9% of the omecamtiv mecarbil–treated patients and 15.5% in the placebo group, with no significant differences in rates of death (2.6% versus 3.3%, respectively). Finally, in a strategy study, the ESCAPE (Evaluation Study of Congestive Heart Failure and Pulmonary Artery Catheterization Effectiveness), patients were assigned to receive therapy guided by clinical assessment and a pulmonary artery catheter or clinical assessment alone. Therapy in both groups led to substantial reduction in symptoms, jugular venous pressure, and edema. Use of the pulmonary artery catheter did not significantly affect the primary end point of days alive and out of the hospital during the first 6 months, mortality, or the number of days hospitalized.

The results of these studies have been disappointing to the HF research community and patients.

Results from clinical trials

Clinical trials of inotropes in heart failure have reinforced an important lesson: whereas short‐term surrogate endpoints such as haemodynamics might improve with these therapies, this does not necessarily translate into improvements in mortality. Inotropic therapies to date have failed to improve 'hard' clinical outcomes in heart failure, and the majority resulted in worse outcomes (Table 2). 14, 32, 34, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57 Furthermore, only a subset of results from trials investigating inotropes have been published, some many years after the results were presented, and the primary data are not available for analysis making a meticulous post‐mortem of disappointing prior results challenging. 58, 59

### First do no harm: surrogate endpoints and the lesson of β-agonists in acute lung injury [^116R8ZBT]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

Background

β2-adrenergic receptor agonists accelerate resolution of pulmonary edema in experimental and clinical studies of acute lung injury (ALI).

Methods

Objective: To determine whether an aerosolized β2-agonist would improve clinical outcomes in patients with ALI. Design: Multi-center, phase III randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Setting: 33 hospitals participating National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) Clinical Trials Network. Subjects: Patients who were intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation, had bilateral infiltrates consistent with edema on frontal chest radiograph, had a ratio of PaO2 to FIO2 (fraction of inspired oxygen) of 300 or less, and not had clinical evidence of left atrial hypertension. A maximum enrolment of 1,000 patients was planned. Intervention: Patients were randomized to receive aerosolized albuterol (5 mg) or saline placebo every 4 hours for up to 10 days. Outcomes: The primary outcome variable was ventilator-free days (VFD). Secondary outcome measures included mortality before hospital discharge on day 60 and day 90, the number of intensive care unit (ICU)-free days and the number of organ failure-free days.

Results

There were 282 patients enrolled before the trial was stopped for futility after the second interim analysis. The VFDs difference with albuterol treatment was unfavourable by -2.2 days, well past the futility boundary of -0.4 VFDs. VFDs were not significantly different between the albuterol and placebo groups (means of 14.4 and 16.6 days, respectively; 95% confidence interval for the difference, -4.7 to 0.3 days; P = 0.087). Rates of death before hospital discharge and the number of organ failure-free days were also not significantly different between the two groups. The number of ICU-free days was lower in the albuterol group in comparison with the placebo group (means of 13.5 and 16.2 days respectively; 95% confidence intervals for the mean difference, -4.9 to -0.4 days; P = 0.023). Overall, heart rates were significantly higher in the albuterol group by approximately 5 beats/minute in the first 2 days after randomization (P < 0.05), but rates of new onset atrial fibrillation (10% in both groups) and other cardiac dysrhythmias were not significantly different.

Conclusions

These results suggest that aerosolized albuterol does not improve clinical outcomes in ALI patients. Routine use of β2 agonist therapy in mechanically ventilated ALI patients cannot be recommended.

### Should acute treatment with inhaled beta agonists be withheld from patients with dyspnea who may have heart failure? [^117PPEWG]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

In patients with dyspnea, prehospital and emergency providers make therapeutic decisions before a diagnosis is established. Inhaled beta-2 agonists are frontline treatment for patients with dyspnea due to asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations. However, these agents have been associated with increased adverse events when administered chronically to heart failure patients. Our goal was to determine the safety and efficacy of acute administration of inhaled beta-2 agonists to patients with heart failure. MEDLINE and EMBASE searches were performed using the terms "beta agonists", "albuterol", "congestive heart failure", and "pulmonary edema". Bibliographies of relevant articles were searched. Only studies addressing acute effects of beta-2 agonists were included for analysis. Twenty-four studies comprising 434 patients were identified that addressed the acute delivery of beta-2 agonists in subjects with heart failure — five studies with inhaled administration and 19 with systemic administration. No study directly evaluated the effects of inhaled beta-2 agonists to patients with acutely decompensated heart failure. Treatment of heart failure patients with beta-2 agonists resulted in transient improvements in pulmonary function and cardiovascular hemodynamics. Only one investigation reported an association between beta-2 agonist use and an increase in malignant dysrhythmias. Investigations in animal models of heart failure and acute lung injury demonstrated resolution of pulmonary edema with beta agonist administration. There is insufficient evidence to suggest that acute treatment with inhaled beta-2 agonists should be avoided in patients with dyspnea who may have heart failure. Based on small studies and indirect evidence, administration of beta-2 agonists to patients with heart failure seems to improve pulmonary function, cardiovascular hemodynamics, and resorption of pulmonary edema. Although an increase in adverse effects with the use of beta-2 agonists cannot be ruled out based on these data, there was no evidence of an increase in clinically significant dysrhythmias, especially when administered by inhalation. Based on these findings, further study should focus on the clinical outcomes of patients with acutely decompensated heart failure who are treated with inhaled beta-2 agonist therapy.

### Effect of intravenous β-2 agonist treatment on clinical outcomes in acute respiratory distress syndrome (BALTI-2): a multicentre, randomised controlled trial [^111yRCQe]. Lancet (2012). Excellent credibility.

Background

In a previous randomised controlled phase 2 trial, intravenous infusion of salbutamol for up to 7 days in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) reduced extravascular lung water and plateau airway pressure. We assessed the effects of this intervention on mortality in patients with ARDS.

Methods

We did a multicentre, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, randomised trial at 46 UK intensive-care units between December, 2006, and March, 2010. Intubated and mechanically ventilated patients (aged ≥ 16 years) within 72 h of ARDS onset were randomly assigned to receive either salbutamol (15 μg/kg ideal bodyweight per h) or placebo for up to 7 days. Randomisation was done by a central telephone or web-based randomisation service with minmisation by centre, pressure of arterial oxygen to fractional inspired oxygen concentration (PaO(2)/F(I)O(2)) ratio, and age. All participants, caregivers, and investigators were masked to group allocation. The primary outcome was death within 28 days of randomisation. Analysis was by intention-to-treat. This trial is registered, ISRCTN38366450 and EudraCT number 2006–002647–86.

Findings

We randomly assigned 162 patients to the salbutamol group and 164 to the placebo group. One patient in each group withdrew consent. Recruitment was stopped after the second interim analysis because of safety concerns. Salbutamol increased 28-day mortality (55 [34%] of 161 patients died in the salbutamol group vs 38 (23%) of 163 in the placebo group; risk ratio [RR] 1.47, 95% CI 1.03–2.08).

Interpretation

Treatment with intravenous salbutamol early in the course of ARDS was poorly tolerated. Treatment is unlikely to be beneficial, and could worsen outcomes. Routine use of β-2 agonist treatment in ventilated patients with this disorder cannot be recommended.

### Expert consensus document: echocardiography and lung ultrasonography for the assessment and management of acute heart failure [^113wwZC9]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2017). Medium credibility.

Inotropes and vasoactive agents

Although inotropes and vasopressors are commonly used to improve cardiac output and blood pressure in patients with cardiogenic shock, there is currently insufficient evidence to support the use of any particular agent in this context. Dobutamine is generally the first-line inotrope of choice in the clinic. The detrimental effects of positive inotropic agents have been extensively described in the literature, and their use should, therefore, be restricted to the shortest possible duration and the lowest dose, both individualized to the patient. Although little guidance exists on how inotrope treatment should be individualized, echocardiography might be helpful in certain scenarios.

First, not all patients with cardiac disease respond to escalating doses of dobutamine by increasing their stroke volume; in some patients, dobutamine can result in an increase in the total isovolumic time (tIVT). Echocardiographic identification of an abnormally prolonged tIVT with dobutamine use, or an increase in tIVT in response to escalating inotropic support might indicate that inotropes are directly impairing myocardial performance, thereby prompting a reduction in dose or a change in treatment strategy – (FIG. 5). Second, the combination of LV end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) and low aortic root pressure might result in a mismatch of coronary perfusion and myocardial oxygen demand. If untreated, this mismatch can result in type 2 myocardial infarction(FIG. 3d). Echocardiographic demonstration of a dominant or isolated A wave on transmitral Doppler in combination with postejection shortening can also be diagnostic (FIG. 6a, b), and indicates that aortic root pressure should be increased and/or LVEDP reduced. Third, physiological studies have demonstrated that the combination of RV ischaemia and increased RV afterload is particularly injurious to RV performance, resulting in a fall in systemic blood pressure and cardiac output levels. Echocardiography can be used to estimate pulmonary artery systolic pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance, as well as measure RV dimensions and performance. Echocardiographic identification of high pulmonary vascular resistance with or without pulmonary hypertension in combination with RV dysfunction in cardiogenic shock might necessitate the introduction of a pressor agent plus treatment to reduce RV after-load, (FIG. 6c, d). Finally, in a patient with falling cardiac output levels despite escalating inotropic support, echocardiography can help to diagnose LV outflow tract obstruction (with or without associated mitral regurgitation). Treatment in this context involves reduction or cessation of positive inotropic agents, in combination with volume and pressor support.

### Why has positive inotropy failed in chronic heart failure? Lessons from prior inotrope trials [^113nwHdf]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2019). Medium credibility.

The mechanism and dosage of inotropic agents can cause adverse effects

There is a possibility that the adverse effects of inotropic agents on myocardial energetics and intracellular calcium could explain the results of prior trials: by increasing energy consumption and leading to exhaustion of the energy stores, these agents could promote pump failure as well as ventricular arrhythmias via dysfunctional calcium cycling. In fact, the negative long‐term impact of catecholamines on the heart, and the beneficial impact of β‐blockade, has been demonstrated in several landmark studies. 90 Additionally, data suggest that drugs acting via cAMP modulation lead to adverse effects in the long term by causing desensitization of the contractile apparatus to calcium, disturbing intracellular calcium homeostasis, causing ventricular arrhythmias, and disrupting lusitropy. Studies have shown that left ventricular function deteriorates to below pre‐treatment levels after withdrawal of inotropes, demonstrating that the therapy accelerates ventricular dysfunction. 91 It is conceivable that β‐adrenergic blocking agents might have prevented this deterioration of ventricular function, but their usage was infrequent during most clinical trials.

An intriguing corollary to the notion that the inotropic effects of drugs might explain their negative impact on clinical outcomes is that many clinical trials studying these agents aimed to maximize their positive haemodynamic effects and used very high doses for this purpose. Similar to the deleterious effects of very high doses of digoxin, it is quite possible that by chasing the wrong intermediate measures of heart failure, prior studies drove up the risk of myocardial toxicity and shifted the risk–benefit equation in the wrong direction. 80 This was articulated by Dr. Milton Packer in a perspective article published in a 1993 issue of JACC — in the aftermath of a large number of negative inotrope trials — where he concluded: 'The belief that positive inotropic agents for heart failure should be developed at inotropic doses may have been the primary factor for the controversy that has surrounded these drugs for the last 200 years'. 80

### Cardioselective β-blocker use in patients with reversible airway disease [^1163Pb7L]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Beta-blocker therapy has mortality benefit in patients with hypertension, heart failure and coronary artery disease, as well as during the perioperative period. These drugs have traditionally been considered contraindicated in patients with reversible airway disease.

Objectives

To assess the effect of cardioselective beta-blockers on respiratory function of patients with reversible airway disease. Reversible airway disease was defined as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with a reversible obstructive component.

Search Strategy

A comprehensive search of EMBASE, MEDLINE and CINAHL was performed using the Cochrane Airways Group registry to identify randomized blinded placebo-controlled trials from 1966 to February, 2000. The search was completed using the terms: asthma*, bronchial hyperreactivity*, respiratory sounds*, wheez*, obstructive lung disease* or obstructive airway disease*, and adrenergic antagonist*, sympatholytic* or adrenergic receptor block*. We did not exclude trials on the basis of language.

Selection Criteria

Randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled trials of single dose or longer duration that studied the effects of cardioselective beta-blockers on the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), symptoms and use of short-acting inhaled beta-agonists, in patients with reversible airway disease. Reversible airway disease was documented by response to methacholine challenge, by an increase in FEV1 of at least 15% to beta-agonist administration, or the presence of asthma as defined by the American Thoracic Society.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two independent reviewers extracted data from the selected articles, reconciling differences by consensus. Cardioselective beta-blockers were divided into 2 groups, those with or without intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA). Two interventions studied were the administration of beta-blocker, given either as a single dose or for longer duration, and the use of beta-agonist given after the study drug.

Main Results

Nineteen studies for single-dose treatment and 10 for treatment of longer duration met selection criteria. The patients had mild-moderate airways obstruction. For cardioselective beta-blockers taken as a group, administration of a single dose was associated with a 7.98% (CI, 6.19 to 9.77%) reduction in FEV1, but with a 13.16% (CI, 10.76 to 15.56%) increase in beta-agonist response, as compared to placebo. There was no increase in symptoms. After treatment lasting a few days to a few weeks, there was no decrement in FEV1 compared to placebo and no increase in symptoms or inhaler use. Regular use of cardioselective beta-blockers without ISA produced a 13.13% (CI, 5.97 to 20.30) increase in beta-agonist response compared to placebo, a response not seen with beta-blockers containing ISA (-0.60% [CI, -11.7 to +10.5%]).

Reviewer's Conclusions

Cardioselective beta-blockers, given to patients with mild-moderate reversible airway disease, do not produce clinically significant adverse respiratory effects in the short term. It is not possible to comment on their effects in patient with more severe or less reversible disease, or on their effect on the frequency or severity of acute exacerbations. Given their demonstrated benefit in conditions such as heart failure, coronary artery disease and hypertension, cardioselective beta-blockers should not be withheld from patients with mild-moderate reversible airway disease.

Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Chronic heart failure — trial populations and outcomes with beta-blockers: Beta-blockers have been evaluated in more than 20 000 patients across more than 20 published placebo-controlled trials, enrolling patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) defined as EF less than 35% to 45% who were already treated with diuretics and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), with or without digitalis. Trials generally excluded or underrepresented patients with preserved systolic function, low heart rates (less than 65 beats per min), low systolic blood pressure (less than 85 mm Hg), hospitalization, or class IV HF; one carvedilol trial enrolled clinically stable NYHA class III and IV patients free of edema and showed a mortality reduction similar to less advanced disease. Collectively, long-term beta-blocker therapy can lessen HF symptoms, improve clinical status and well-being, and reduce the risk of death and the combined risk of death or hospitalization, with benefits seen regardless of coronary artery disease or diabetes status and in women and black patients; favorable effects were also observed in patients already taking ACEIs, suggesting additive effects from combined blockade of the 2 neurohormonal systems.

### Acute myocardial infarction associated with albuterol [^115S38sQ]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To report a case of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) following the use of albuterol (salbutamol) in a patient without preexisting coronary artery disease and to review the related literature.

Case Summary

An 84-year-old white woman with no history of cardiac disease was treated for an exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with albuterol 5 mg and ipratropium bromide 500 microg nebulized with oxygen; the albuterol was given in the same dose every 2 hours. Her respiratory condition improved, but soon after the sixth dose of albuterol, she developed increasing chest tightness. The electrocardiogram (ECG) showed ST segment elevation in the chest leads (V(2,3)) and, subsequently, the troponin I concentration and creatine kinase rose. Urgent coronary angiography showed smooth coronary arteries with no obstructive coronary artery disease or thrombosis. Left ventriculography showed anterior hypokinesia consistent with anterior myocardial injury. A subsequent echocardiogram also revealed normal left ventricular size but anterior, anteroseptal, and apical hypokinesia. An objective causality assessment revealed that albuterol had a probable likelihood of causing the AMI in this patient.

Discussion

A MEDLINE search (1966-February 2004) revealed 6 other case reports of AMI associated with albuterol treatment. The possible pathogenesis of albuterol-induced myocardial necrosis includes activation of cardiac and peripheral beta(2)-adrenoceptors, inducing positive chronotropic and inotropic effects and vasodilation with coronary blood flow redistribution. Albuterol can also cause hypokalemia and other metabolic and electrical changes, including prolonged QT interval. These effects may be especially detrimental in patients with hypoxia, hypercapnea, and preexisting heart diseases.

Conclusions

Although myocardial injury is a rare complication following albuterol therapy, clinicians should use high-dose beta(2)-agonists with caution. Close monitoring of ECG and metabolic changes is recommended before early repeated high doses are administered.

Rescue use of a short acting β2 agonist

In five of six trials salmeterol treatment was associated with less salbutamol use than was placebo treatment In one trial (4+4 weeks) the median numbers (range) of daytime rescue doses were 1.7 (0–6.1) and 2.6 (0–7.9), respectively, and the median numbers of night-time doses 0 (0–4.2) and 0.3 (0–5.0). In a 52 week trial. the median number of rescue inhalations per day was 2 for both salmeterol and placebo recipients, but these groups were statistically different (p = 0.028). Another trial reported the mean number of doses of rescue salbutamol was significantly lower during treatment in salmeterol recipients (0.59, 95%CI: 0.30 to 0.88) versus placebo recipients (1.75, 95%CI: 1.33 to 2.17).

In one 12 week trial comparing salmeterol, ipratropium, and placebo no significant difference was observed in additional bronchodilator use between the placebo and active drug groups.

### Effect of lung deflation with indacaterol plus glycopyrronium on ventricular filling in patients with hyperinflation and COPD (CLAIM): a double-blind, randomised, crossover, placebo-controlled, single-centre trial [^113dedv2]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Background

Pulmonary hyperinflation in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is associated with reduced biventricular end-diastolic volumes and increased morbidity and mortality. The combination of a long-acting β agonist (LABA) and a muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) is more effective in reducing hyperinflation than LABA-inhaled corticosteroid combination therapy but whether dual bronchodilation improves cardiac function is unknown.

Methods

We did a double-blind, randomised, two-period crossover, placebo-controlled, single-centre study (CLAIM) at the Fraunhofer Institute of Toxicology and Experimental Medicine (Hannover, Germany), a specialty clinic. Eligible participants were patients aged at least 40 years with COPD, pulmonary hyperinflation (defined by a baseline residual volume > 135% of predicted), a smoking history of at least ten pack-years, and airflow limitation (FEV 1 < 80% predicted and post-bronchodilator FEV 1: forced vital capacity < 0.7). Patients with stable cardiovascular disease were eligible, but those with arrhythmias, heart failure, unstable ischaemic heart disease, or uncontrolled hypertension were not. We randomly assigned participants (1:1) to either receive a combined inhaled dual bronchodilator containing the LABA indacaterol (110 μg as maleate salt) plus the LAMA glycopyrronium (50 μg as bromide salt) once per day for 14 days, followed by a 14-day washout, then a matched placebo for 14 days, or to receive the same treatments in reverse order. The randomisation was done using lists and was concealed from patients and investigators. The primary endpoint was the effect of indacaterol-glycopyrronium versus placebo on left-ventricular end-diastolic volume measured by MRI done on day 1 (visit 4) and day 15 (visit 5) in treatment period 1 and on day 29 (visit 6) and day 43 (visit 7) in treatment period 2 in the per-protocol population. Left-ventricular end-diastolic volume was indexed to body surface area. Safety was assessed in all participants who received at least one dose of the study drug. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02442206.

Findings

Between May 18, 2015, and April 20, 2017, we randomly assigned 62 eligible participants to treatment; 30 to indacaterol-glycopyrronium followed by placebo and 32 to placebo followed by indacaterol-glycopyrronium. The 62 randomly assigned patients were included in the intent-to-treat analysis. There were two protocol violations and therefore 60 were included in the per-protocol analysis. 57 patients completed both treatment periods. After indacaterol-glycopyrronium treatment, left-ventricular end-diastolic volume increased from a mean 55.46 mL/m 2 (SD 15.89) at baseline to a least-squares (LS) mean of 61.76 mL/m 2 (95% CI 57.68–65.84), compared with a change from 56.42 mL/m 2 at baseline (13.54) to 56.53 mL/m 2 (52.43–60.62) after placebo (LS means treatment difference 5.23 mL/m 2 [95% CI 3.22 to 7.25; p < 0.0001]). The most common adverse events reported with indacaterol-glycopyrronium were cough (in nine patients [15%] of 59) and throat irritation (in seven [12%]). With placebo, the most common adverse events reported were headache (in five patients [8%] of 61) and upper respiratory tract infection (in four [7%]). Two patients had serious adverse events: one (2%) after indacaterol-glycopyrronium (endometrial cancer) and one (2%) after placebo (myocardial infarction); these were not thought to be treatment related. No patients died during the study.

Interpretation

This is the first study to analyse the effect of LABA-LAMA combination therapy on cardiac function in patients with COPD and lung hyperinflation. Dual bronchodilation with indacaterol-glycopyrronium significantly improved cardiac function as measured by left-ventricular end-diastolic volume. The results are important because of the known association of cardiovascular impairment with COPD, and support the early use of dual bronchodilation in patients with COPD who show signs of pulmonary hyperinflation.

### Cardiovascular effects of β-agonists in patients with asthma and COPD: a meta-analysis [^114N5Wqd]. Chest (2004). Low credibility.

Background

beta-Adrenergic agonists exert physiologic effects that are the opposite of those of beta-blockers. beta-Blockers are known to reduce morbidity and mortality in patients with cardiac disease. beta(2)-Agonist use in patients with obstructive airway disease has been associated with an increased risk for myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, cardiac arrest, and acute cardiac death.

Objectives

To assess the cardiovascular safety of beta(2)-agonist use in patients with obstructive airway disease, defined as asthma or COPD.

Methods

A meta-analysis of randomized placebo-controlled trials of beta(2)-agonist treatment in patients with obstructive airway disease was performed, to evaluate the short-term effect on heart rate and potassium concentrations, and the long-term effect on adverse cardiovascular events. Longer duration trials were included in the analysis if they reported at least one adverse event. Adverse events included sinus and ventricular tachycardia, syncope, atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest, or sudden death.

Results

Thirteen single-dose trials and 20 longer duration trials were included in the study. A single dose of beta(2)-agonist increased the heart rate by 9.12 beats/min (95% confidence interval [CI] 5.32 to 12.92) and reduced the potassium concentration by 0.36 mmol/L (95% CI, 0.18 to 0.54), compared to placebo. For trials lasting from 3 days to 1 year, beta(2)-agonist treatment significantly increased the risk for a cardiovascular event (relative risk [RR], 2.54; 95% CI, 1.59 to 4.05) compared to placebo. The RR for sinus tachycardia alone was 3.06 (95% CI, 1.70 to 5.50), and for all other events it was 1.66 (95% CI, 0.76 to 3.6).

Conclusion

beta(2)-Agonist use in patients with obstructive airway disease increases the risk for adverse cardiovascular events. The initiation of treatment increases heart rate and reduces potassium concentrations compared to placebo. It could be through these mechanisms, and other effects of beta-adrenergic stimulation, that beta(2)-agonists may precipitate ischemia, congestive heart failure, arrhythmias, and sudden death.

### Inhaled β-2 agonist salbutamol and acute lung injury: an association with improvement in acute lung injury [^116hcrUa]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

Introduction

Acute lung injury (ALI) is defined by impaired oxygenation (arterial partial pressure of oxygen/fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO 2 /FiO 2) < 300 mmHg) and bilateral infiltrates on a chest radiograph without clinical evidence of left atrial hypertension. Pulmonary edema in ALI is caused by damage to the alveolar-capillary interface and increased permeability that leads to accumulation of protein rich edema fluid in the interstitial and alveolar spaces. Reabsorptive mechanisms to clear alveolar edema fluid are impaired in acute lung injury. Furthermore, there is a dose effect indicated by the association of the greater degree of impaired edema clearance with longer duration of mechanical ventilation and decreased survival.

β2 agonists have several properties that could be beneficial in ALI. First, inhaled β2 agonists improve respiratory mechanics in patients with ALI as shown by decreased airflow resistance and peak airway pressures and increased dynamic compliance. Second, β2 agonists have anti-inflammatory properties. β2-agonists attenuate the release of tumor necrosis factor-α and increase the production of IL-10 in response to endotoxin in animal models.

Intravenous dobutamine (which has β1 and β2 agonist action) attenuates pro-inflammatory cytokine expression in the lungs of a rat model of septic acute lung injury. Third, β agonists increase alveolar edema fluid clearance in animal models of ALI, in the ex vivo human lung and in patients with ALI. Studies on the selective β blockers show that it is the β2 agonist activities that cause the enhanced edema fluid clearance.

To date, there have been no studies on the dose association of inhaled β agonists with duration or severity of human ALI. Our hypothesis was that a higher dose of inhaled β2 agonist use, compared to a lower dose, is associated with more days alive and free of ALI (a measure of duration of severity of ALI) in critically ill patients with acute lung injury.

### Keeping your patient with heart failure safe… [^112ZdegJ]. JAMA Network (2004). Excellent credibility.

Associated risk factors for ventricular tachyarrhythmias and sudden cardiac death in patients with HF are ventricular dilation, myocardial scar tissue, ventricular hypertrophy, hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia, inotropic support therapies, and sympathoadrenergic activation. 18 Paradoxically, class I antiarrhythmic. medications produce a greater negative inotropic effect, more frequent proarrhythmic effects, and bradyarrhythmias in patients with HF compared with the normal population. 18 The Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trials demonstrated a significant increase in mortality compared with placebo in patients after myocardial infarction who were receiving class Ic agents. This was due to an increase in life-threatening arrhythmias and the conversion of ischemic and HF episodes to fatal events.

19, 20 A post hoc analysis of the Stroke Prevention in Atrial Fibrillation trial found that patients with HF in the study who were receiving antiarrhythmic therapy had a greater risk of cardiac death than patients not receiving one of these agents.
21. In one of the larger studies,
5. 0% of patients with a history of HF experienced torsades de pointes when treated with D, L-sotalol compared with 1. 7% of patients without a history of clinical HF. 23 A meta-analysis showed that proarrhythmia was most often experienced by patients taking sotalol who had a history of HF, sustained ventricular tachycardia, and myocardial infarction. 24 However, this increased incidence of torsades de pointes in patients with HF is not surprising, as they are at a higher risk of arrhythmias than the general population.

The Survival With Oral D-sotalol trial proved that the pure class III antiarrhythmic action of D-sotalol was associated with a higher relative risk of mortality than placebo in patients with an ejection fraction of 40% or less. 25 In contrast, a small. open-label trial in 38 patients demonstrated that D, L-sotalol increased EF in patients with severe LV dysfunction and that therapy up to 6 months did not result in deterioration of EF or worsening HF. 26 This suggests that the class III properties of sotalol may be responsible for the detrimental effects, while the β-blocking properties may be neutral or beneficial.

### Inhaled β-agonist does not modify sympathetic activity in patients with COPD [^113SSivJ]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The observed changes in HRV are suggestive of a decrease in parasympathetic tone. Similar results were observed in a small study using the SABA salbutamol. However, given the absence of significant changes in MSNA and baroreflex sensitivity, the HRV findings are difficult to interpret. Furthermore, changes in ventilation and heart rate as present in our study impact on HRV thus rendering interpretation even more problematic.

Sympathoexcitation in COPD is thought to be caused by several mechanisms such as hypoxia, chemoreflexes, impaired baroreflexes and lung hyperinflation. Lung hyperinflation affects the autonomic nervous system by activation of intrapulmonary non-myelinated afferents and by increased end-expiratory pressure with consecutive impaired left ventricular filling and reduced stroke volume. Furthermore hyperinflation increases the work of breathing and thus impacts on muscle metaboreceptors. Thus we speculated that the improvement of lung function and hyperinflation following inhaled therapy reduces sympathetic activation. However, despite reducing hyperinflation, salmeterol did not impact on sympathetic tone in our study. It is possible that the positive effects mediated via bronchiodilatation were too small to elicit a reduction in sympathetic activity. It is also possible, that any positive effect on sympathetic activity were offset by consequences of systemic β-receptor activation. Our study is not able to further dissect these possibilities. In this context it would be interesting to investigate an inhaled therapy with stronger bronchodilator activity.

We studied not only the acute but also the long-term effects of salmeterol over one month. As in the acute setting, MSNA and other measures of autonomic nervous system activity were unchanged. Desensitization or saturation of β2-adrenoceptors that follows regular use of β2-agonist treatment is believed to be responsible for the resolution of hemodynamic findings after the first days and weeks and may also prevent long-term effects of salmeterol on MSNA. However, in our study the acute effects were comparable to the effects after 4 weeks. Specifically the increase in heart rate was similar in the acute and long-term setting.

### Why has positive inotropy failed in chronic heart failure? Lessons from prior inotrope trials [^116qgRPr]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2019). Medium credibility.

' Experience with intravenous dobutamine in controlled trials does not extend beyond 48 h of repeated boluses and/or continuous infusions. Whether given orally, continuously intravenously, or intermittently intravenously, neither dobutamine nor any other cAMP‐dependent inotrope has been shown in controlled trials to be safe or effective in the long‐term treatment of congestive heart failure. In controlled trials of chronic oral therapy with various such agents, symptoms were not consistently alleviated, and the cAMP‐dependent inotropes were consistently associated with increased risks of hospitalization and death. Patients with NYHA class IV symptoms appeared to be at particular risk'.
Why is use of these agents so common? Clearly, there is a large and rapidly growing population of patients who might benefit from these medications and were not represented in prior clinical trials. At the current time, however, several questions about inotrope usage in stage D heart failure remain unanswered. We do not know: (i) how to identify the patient populations who will benefit from these therapies, (ii) whether the benefits are purely symptomatic or can extend to hard clinical outcomes, (iii) how to dose either inotropes or concomitant neurohormonal therapies, and (iv) how inotrope use can fit into the patient‐centred decision‐ making regarding complex therapies for end‐stage heart failure. The epidemiologic insignificance of heart transplantation as a therapeutic intervention and the cost and morbidity associated with ventricular assist devices create an enormous potential for positive inotropic therapies for advanced heart failure. Currently there is a large chasm between clinical practice and academic understanding of these agents. Addressing these questions are likely to bring us closer to using and developing cardiac inotropes that meet patient‐specific needs without causing disproportionate harm.

Heart Rhythm (2016). Medium credibility.

Physiological sinus tachycardia — definition and causes: Sinus tachycardia is regarded as physiological when it is the result of appropriate autonomic influences, such as in the setting of physical activity or emotional responses. Physiological sinus tachycardia may result from pathological causes, including infection with fever, dehydration, anemia, heart failure, and hyperthyroidism, in addition to exogenous substances, including caffeine, drugs with a beta-agonist effect (eg, albuterol, salmeterol), and illicit stimulant drugs (eg, amphetamines, cocaine). In these cases, tachycardia is expected to resolve with correction of the underlying cause.

Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Intravenous peripheral vasodilators and positive inotropic agents — refractory heart failure (HF): during hospitalizations for clinical deterioration, patients commonly receive infusions of both positive inotropic agents (dobutamine, dopamine, or milrinone) and vasodilator drugs (nitroglycerin, nitroprusside, or nesiritide). Some physicians have advocated pulmonary artery catheter–guided therapy, but the logic of this approach has been questioned. Regardless of whether invasive hemodynamic monitoring is used, once the clinical status has stabilized, every effort should be made to devise an oral regimen that can maintain symptomatic improvement and reduce the subsequent risk of deterioration, and assessment may necessitate observation in the hospital for at least 48 hours after the infusions are discontinued. Patients who cannot be weaned to oral therapy despite repeated attempts may require an indwelling intravenous catheter for the continuous infusion of dobutamine or milrinone, or nesiritide; such a strategy is commonly used while awaiting cardiac transplantation and may also be used in the outpatient setting in patients who otherwise cannot be discharged. The decision to continue intravenous infusions at home should not be made until all alternative attempts to achieve stability have failed repeatedly because this approach may ultimately increase the risk of death, although continuous intravenous support can provide palliative symptom relief as part of an overall plan to allow the patient to die with comfort at home. The use of continuous intravenous support to allow hospital discharge should be distinguished from the intermittent administration of infusions to patients who have been successfully weaned from inotropic support.

### Beta (2) adrenergic receptors mediate important electrophysiological effects in human ventricular myocardium [^115Y4JpC]. Heart (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To define the effects of beta(2) adrenergic receptor stimulation on ventricular repolarisation in vivo.

Design

Prospective study.

Setting

Tertiary referral centre.

Patients

85 patients with coronary artery disease and 22 normal controls.

Interventions

Intravenous and intracoronary salbutamol (a beta(2) adrenergic receptor selective agonist; 10–30 microg/min and 1–10 microg/min), and intravenous isoprenaline (a mixed beta(1)/beta(2) adrenergic receptor agonist; 1–5 microg/min), infused during fixed atrial pacing.

Main Outcome Measures

QT intervals, QT dispersion, monophasic action potential duration.

Results

In patients with coronary artery disease, salbutamol decreased QT(onset) and QT(peak) but increased QT(end) duration; QT(onset)-QT(peak) and QT(peak)-QT(end) intervals increased, resulting in T wave prolongation (mean (SEM): 201 (2) ms to 233 (2) ms; p < 0.01). There was a large increase in dispersion of QT(onset), QT(peak), and QT(end) which was more pronounced in patients with coronary artery disease-for example, QT(end) dispersion: 50 (2) ms baseline v 98 (4) ms salbutamol (controls), and 70 (1) ms baseline v 108 (3) ms salbutamol (coronary artery disease); p < 0.001. Similar responses were obtained with isoprenaline. Monophasic action potential duration at 90% repolarisation shortened during intracoronary infusion of salbutamol, from 278 (4.1) ms to 257 (3.8) ms (p < 0.05).

Conclusions

beta(2) adrenergic receptors mediate important electrophysiological effects in human ventricular myocardium. The increase in dispersion of repolarisation provides a mechanism whereby catecholamines acting through this receptor subtype may trigger ventricular arrhythmias.

### Why has positive inotropy failed in chronic heart failure? Lessons from prior inotrope trials [^1165MG7d]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2019). Medium credibility.

Current pharmacological therapies for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction are largely either repurposed anti-hypertensives that blunt overactivation of the neurohormonal system or diuretics that decrease congestion. However, they do not address the symptoms of heart failure that result from reductions in cardiac output and reserve. Over the last few decades, numerous attempts have been made to develop and test positive cardiac inotropes that improve cardiac haemodynamics. However, definitive clinical trials have failed to show a survival benefit. As a result, no positive inotrope is currently approved for long-term use in heart failure. The focus of this state-of-the-art review is to revisit prior clinical trials and to understand the causes for their findings. Using the learnings from those experiences, we propose a framework for future trials of such agents that maximizes their potential for success. This includes enriching the trials with patients who are most likely to derive benefit, using biomarkers and imaging in trial design and execution, evaluating efficacy based on a wider range of intermediate phenotypes, and collecting detailed data on functional status and quality of life. With a rapidly growing population of patients with advanced heart failure, the epidemiologic insignificance of heart transplantation as a therapeutic intervention, and both the cost and morbidity associated with ventricular assist devices, there is an enormous potential for positive inotropic therapies to impact the outcomes that matter most to patients.

### Effects of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in EMPHASIS-HF and RALES [^114LcdKg]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is more common in patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) than in the general population because each condition can arise as a complication of smoking. Concomitant COPD is associated with even worse symptoms, functional limitation and clinical outcomes than in HFrEF alone. Coexisting COPD also creates therapeutic difficulties. Beta‐blockers are a key, life‐saving treatment for HFrEF, but may not be tolerated in people with COPD, antagonise the effects of beta‐2 adrenoceptor agonists, a core therapy for COPD, and can cause exacerbations of COPD. However, many if not most patients with COPD can tolerate a beta‐1 selective blocker and this treatment should not be withheld in patients with COPD. Conversely, beta‐2 adrenoceptor agonists can cause tachycardia and hypokalaemia, neither of which is desirable in HFrEF. Both hypokalaemia and methylxanthines, another therapy for COPD, can predispose to arrhythmias. Corticosteroids, especially if given orally, cause fluid retention which is undesirable in HFrEF and in COPD, which is itself a sodium‐ and water‐retaining state (although both methylxanthines and systemic corticosteroids are used in a small minority of patients in most countries).

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^114UbfqK]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Heart failure in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) — prevalence and management: The prevalence of systolic or diastolic heart failure in COPD patients ranges from 20% to 70%, and its annual incidence is between 3–4%. Incident heart failure is a significant and independent predictor of all-cause mortality. Unrecognized heart failure may mimic or accompany acute COPD; 40% of COPD patients that are mechanically ventilated because of hypercapnic respiratory failure have evidence of left ventricular dysfunction. Treatment with β1-blockers improves survival in heart failure and is recommended in patients with heart failure who also have COPD. Selective β1-blockers should be used, and only used, to treat people with COPD for approved cardiovascular indications; not solely for the purpose of preventing exacerbations of COPD. Acute heart failure should be treated according to usual heart failure guidelines since there is no evidence to support an alternative management strategy, and noninvasive ventilation added to conventional therapy improves outcomes for patients with either hypercapnic respiratory failure due to an exacerbation of COPD as well as heart failure with acute pulmonary edema.

### Cardioselective β-blockers for reversible airway disease [^112CGamV]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Beta-blocker therapy has mortality benefit in patients with hypertension, heart failure and coronary artery disease, as well as during the perioperative period. These drugs have traditionally been considered contraindicated in patients with reversible airway disease.

Objectives

To assess the effect of cardioselective beta1-blockers on respiratory function of patients with reversible airway disease. Reversible airway disease was defined as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with a reversible obstructive component.

Search Strategy

A comprehensive search of EMBASE, MEDLINE and CINAHL was performed using the Cochrane Airways Group registry to identify randomized blinded placebo-controlled trials from 1966 to May 2001. The search was completed using the terms: asthma*, bronchial hyperreactivity*, respiratory sounds*, wheez*, obstructive lung disease* or obstructive airway disease*, and adrenergic antagonist*, sympatholytic* or adrenergic receptor block*. We did not exclude trials on the basis of language.

Selection Criteria

Randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled trials of single dose or longer duration that studied the effects of cardioselective beta1-blockers on the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), symptoms and use of short-acting inhaled beta2-agonists, in patients with reversible airway disease. Reversible airway disease was documented by response to methacholine challenge, by an increase in FEV1 of at least 15% to beta2-agonist administration, or the presence of asthma as defined by the American Thoracic Society.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two independent reviewers extracted data from the selected articles, reconciling differences by consensus. Cardioselective beta1-blockers were divided into 2 groups, those with or without intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA). Two interventions studied were the administration of beta1-blocker, given either as a single dose or for longer duration, and the use of beta2-agonist given after the study drug.

Main Results

Nineteen studies for single-dose treatment and 10 for treatment of longer duration met selection criteria. The patients had mild-moderate airways obstruction. For cardioselective beta1-blockers taken as a group, administration of a single dose was associated with a 7.98% (CI, 6.19 to 9.77%) reduction in FEV1, but with a 13.16% (CI, 10.76 to 15.56%) increase in beta2-agonist response, as compared to placebo. There was no increase in symptoms. After treatment lasting a few days to a few weeks, there was no decrement in FEV1 compared to placebo and no increase in symptoms or inhaler use. Regular use of cardioselective beta1-blockers without ISA produced a 13.13% (CI, 5.97 to 20.30) increase in beta2-agonist response compared to placebo, a response not seen with beta1-blockers containing ISA (-0.60% [CI, -11.7 to +10.5%]).

Reviewer's Conclusions

Cardioselective beta1-blockers, given to patients with mild-moderate reversible airway disease, do not produce clinically significant adverse respiratory effects in the short term. It is not possible to comment on their effects in patient with more severe or less reversible disease, or on their effect on the frequency or severity of acute exacerbations. Given their demonstrated benefit in conditions such as heart failure, coronary artery disease and hypertension, cardioselective beta1-blockers should not be withheld from patients with mild-moderate reversible airway disease.

### Drugs that may cause or exacerbate heart failure: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^116exo7L]. Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary agents — β2-agonists and heart failure (HF) risk — show dose-related and arrhythmic hospitalization signals. A retrospective case-control study demonstrated a 3-fold increase in cardiomyopathy risk with systemic or inhaled β2-agonist use, and a dose-related increase in risk for hospital admission with deteriorating HF in patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction (EF) using inhaled β2-agonists was reported (1–2 canisters per month: adjusted OR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.1–3.0; ≥ 3 canisters per month: adjusted OR, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.2–3.8). Another study found an increased risk of hospitalization for ventricular arrhythmia in patients receiving β2-agonists (OR, 4.0; 95% CI, 1.0–15.1), higher with systemic than inhaled formulations, and regular exposure could theoretically lead to HF deterioration via decreased receptor responsiveness.

### Effect of beta blockers in treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a retrospective cohort study [^113Xchdb]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

The presence of cardiovascular disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are intertwined because of the risk of smoking induced atherosclerosis in patients with COPD. Despite the proved benefits of β blockers in treating hypertension, ischaemic heart disease, and heart failure, many doctors are reluctant to prescribe β blockers for patients with concurrent COPD.

Historically β blockers have been avoided in asthma because of the risk of acute bronchospasm. These concerns also apply to COPD, with evidence of a reduction in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1), increased airway hyperresponsiveness, and inhibition of bronchodilator response to β agonists in patients receiving non-selective β blockers and high doses of cardioselective β blockers.

Despite these concerns, evidence suggests that cardioselective β blockers do not cause an increase in exacerbations, reduction in airway function, or worsening of quality of life in COPD patients.COPD is a highly heterogeneous condition, and the degree of comorbidities present seems to be independent of the degree of airway obstruction. The treatment of comorbid cardiovascular disease in COPD is especially relevant since cardiac failure has been shown to be a leading cause of death in these patients.

In this regard, the use of β blockers in patients with COPD and cardiovascular disease has been shown to reduce mortality. Whether the improved survival seen with β blockers in COPD is purely due to cardiovascular effects has been questioned. Recent evidence suggests that β blockers may improve survival and exacerbations even in COPD patients without cardiovascular disease.

Although cardioselective β blockers have been designed to target β 1 adrenoceptors while avoiding β 2 adrenoceptors in the lung and elsewhere, so called cardioselective β blockers (such as atenolol and bisoprolol) are only relatively selective and exert significant β 2 antagonism at therapeutic doses, though to a lesser extent than non-selective β blockers such as propranolol. Thus, it might be considered counterintuitive to prescribe both β blockers and β agonists in the same patient, even when they are targeting different organs.

Current COPD management guidelines advocate a stepwise approach using long acting bronchodilators (including β agonists) and inhaled corticosteroids to reduce exacerbations and improve symptoms and lung function. With the exception of tiotropium, combination treatments involving long acting bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroids have failed to show any significant improvement in mortality. We therefore wished to examine the use of β blockers in the management of COPD, assessing their interactions with β agonists and other COPD drug and assess whether they improve mortality, hospital admissions, and exacerbations when added to established treatment for COPD.

### Current diagnostic and treatment strategies for specific dilated cardiomyopathies: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^114kw6fZ]. Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Stress-induced cardiomyopathy — treatment — relies on supportive care focused on managing heart failure (HF) symptoms and treating hypotension and cardiogenic shock with appropriate therapies, while the role of neurohormonal agents is as yet unknown. A catecholamine-mediated process could have implications for management, with agents such as dobutamine theoretically able to worsen stress-induced cardiomyopathy, although this has not been reported or studied clinically; β-blockers can cause stimulus trafficking of β2-adrenergic receptors to Gi protein coupling resulting in negative inotropy. Intra-aortic balloon pump and calcium-sensitizing agents have been suggested as first- and second-line therapies, but the infrequency of this condition and reliance on small series have limited the capacity to develop standardized treatment strategies.

Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Practical use of beta-blockers — initiation and maintenance in chronic heart failure (HF) states that treatment with a beta-blocker should be initiated at very low doses, followed by gradual increments in dose if lower doses have been well tolerated, and patients should be monitored closely for changes in vital signs and symptoms during this uptitration period; physicians should ask patients to weigh themselves daily and to manage any increase in weight by immediately increasing the dose of concomitantly administered diuretic until weight is restored to pretreatment levels, and planned increments in the dose of a beta-blocker should be delayed until any side effects observed with lower doses have disappeared; most patients (approximately 85%) enrolled in clinical trials were able to tolerate short- and long-term treatment and achieve the maximum planned trial dose, beta-blockers can be safely started before discharge in patients hospitalized for HF provided they do not require intravenous therapy for HF, clinical responses are generally delayed and may require 2 to 3 months to become apparent, and abrupt withdrawal can lead to clinical deterioration and should be avoided.

Statistical methods

Sample size estimation was done using nQuery Advisor® 4.0 (Statistical Solutions, Saugus, MA, USA). With a sample size of 27 in each group there was 80% power to detect a 0.75 L/min difference between treatment groups in change in mean cardiac output at two-sided 5% significance level. Calculation assumed common standard deviation (SD) of 0.95 L/min. The planned sample size in this phase IV study was originally 110 patients; however, owing to slow recruitment and on the recommendation of the steering committee, this was reduced to 60 patients (30 patients per treatment group).

The primary objective was to describe the changes, from baseline to 24 h after the start of study drug infusion, in cardiac index, and PCWP and to compare the changes between the treatment groups. With the Hochberg method, significance could be declared for both of the primary haemodynamic variables if both had two-sided P ≤ 0.050. Significance could also be declared for one of the primary haemodynamic variables if two-sided P ≤ 0.025 was reached for one of the variables and P > 0.05 for the other variable. The intention-to-treat (ITT) population, comprising all randomized patients who received study medication, was used in all efficacy analyses.

Changes in both of the haemodynamic variables of the primary analysis were compared between treatment groups using analysis of variance (ANOVA) with effects for treatment, use of carvedilol at baseline and treatment-by-usage of carvedilol interaction (i.e. using an adjusted model) or the non-parametric Mann–Whitney (M-W) depending on whether the data were normally distributed. Analyses were repeated using an unadjusted model. With the exceptions listed below, secondary variables were described and analysed in the same way as the primary efficacy variable.

The changes in NYHA class from baseline to the 1-month follow-up visit were analysed using odds ratio and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). The change in patients' and investigators' assessment of fatigue and dyspnoea were compared between groups using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel row-mean score test. The proportion of patients with treatment discontinuations and/or need for rescue therapy owing to lack of efficacy at any time point were analysed using risk-ratio and 95% CIs.

Circulation (2023). Medium credibility.

Summary of Evidence

Our search identified 403 unique articles, of which 15 underwent full-text review. Thirteen articles were identified that reported adverse effects of short-acting inhaled bronchodilators that could be available to first aid providers caring for patients with reactive airway disease; however, none directly addressed the PICOST. Examples of identified adverse effects were tachycardia, arrhythmias, tremor, dizziness, and a decrease in serum potassium concentrations. Bronchodilators included albuterol (salbutamol) through a nebulizer, albuterol (salbutamol) through a metered dose inhaler, fenoterol through a metered dose inhaler, ipratropium through a nebulizer, and metaproterenol through a nebulizer.

Tachycardia was noted with albuterol; however, the increase in heart rate was less when albuterol was delivered through metered dose inhaler compared with delivery by nebulizer (MD, −6.47 bpm [95% CI, −11.69 to −1.25]; P = 0.02). Other studies noted palpitations (salbutamol)and premature ventricular contractions (fenoterol and albuterol)after the use of inhaled bronchodilators.

Multiple studies – documented a decrease in serum potassium concentration after the use of short-acting β-agonists, although these were typically mild (mean decrease, 0.54 mmol/L in 1 study and 0.52 mmol/L in another), and of uncertain clinical significance.

Case reports – describe multiple side effects in patients exposed to short-acting bronchodilators. A case of unilateral mydriasis developed after nebulized ipratropium came into contact with an eye, resulting in the person receiving a CT scan of the brain to evaluate for intracranial abnormalities. Severe bronchospasm occurred after exposure to an albuterol inhaler and nebulizer treatment. Last, 1 patient developed takotsubo cardiomyopathy that was associated with repetitive use of an albuterol inhaler.

Within the syndrome of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, there is a growing subgroup of patients who have worsening disease that is typified by signs and symptoms of hypotension and hypoperfusion. 7 These patients, characterized as having stage D heart failure, are increasingly unable to tolerate neurohormonal blockade, and their options are limited to cardiac transplantation, ventricular assist devices, inotropic infusions, or hospice. 8 The primary pathology in these patients is thought to be a decrease in cardiac contractility and the development of positive inotropes has been aimed at correcting this defect: almost every inotropic agent that survived to clinical evaluation has shared a common therapeutic goal: to increase the amplitude of cytosolic calcium transients or sensitivity of the sarcomere, thus increasing the force of contraction.

The first of these was dobutamine, created in 1975 by modifying the chemical structure of isoproterenol to reduce its chronotropic, arrhythmogenic, and vascular side effects. This increased its action on the β 1 cardiac receptors whilst minimizing the impact on the α 1 and β 2 vascular receptors. Mechanistically, dobutamine appeared to provide the beneficial aspects of adrenergic signalling in heart failure while bypassing deleterious peripheral vasoconstriction: increasing stroke volume and decreasing systemic and pulmonary vascular resistance and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure.

A string of phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors were subsequently developed, including amrinone and followed by milrinone and enoximone, all of which worked downstream to the β 1 cardiac adrenergic receptors by inhibiting the enzyme (PDE‐3), one of those role is to catalyse the breakdown of cAMP and leading to an increased intracellular calcium. 9, 10, 11, 12 The most prominent of the PDE inhibitors was milrinone; both its intravenous and oral forms improved cardiac haemodynamics in heart failure patients. 13 Phase 2 clinical trials of other PDE inhibitors, such as amrinone and enoximone, also improved haemodynamics and exercise capacity in patients with advanced heart failure. 9, 14

### Metabolic and cardiorespiratory effects of decreasing lung hyperinflation with budesonide / formoterol in COPD: a randomized, double-crossover, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial [^116uzLSQ]. Respiratory Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study of patients with COPD with lung hyperinflation at rest demonstrated that single-dose administration of 2 inhalations of budesonide/formoterol 160/4.5 μg (total dosage 320/9.0 μg) decreased resting lung hyperinflation. Despite this seemingly beneficial effect on respiratory mechanics, there was a significant increase in resting VO 2 and resting VCO 2 with concomitant increases in minute ventilation compared with placebo. The increase in cardiac function after lung deflation in this and other studies with beta-agonist–containing medications may in part be the response to an increase in metabolic demand rather than just better heart function secondary to the improvement in ventilatory mechanics due to lung deflation.

The most novel and clinically relevant findings in this study are the significant increases in resting VO 2 and resting VCO 2 observed after single-dose inhalation of budesonide/formoterol. Because this finding was observed in a double-blind, double-crossover, multicenter design study of patients at rest, it cannot be related to augmented physical activity. The increases in resting VO 2 and resting VCO 2, despite a decrease in resting lung volume as indicated by improvements in airflow limitation and IC, as well as an improvement in all spirometric parameters (FVC, FEV 1, and FEV 1 /FVC) were surprising because those changes are associated with decreased work of breathing. The improvement in respiratory mechanics secondary to the deflation should have resulted in either no change or a decrease in oxygen uptake. The findings of an increase in VO 2 at rest are most consistent with an increase in peripheral muscle utilization of oxygen with increased oxygen extraction, as the changes in cardiac function were minimal. Data from previous studies using the beta-agonist salbutamol support this finding. This appears to be a function of all beta-agonists. Indeed, it has been shown that infusion of the beta-agonist epinephrine activates various glycolytic enzymes and elevates carbohydrate oxidation and glycogen utilization in skeletal muscles. It could be argued that epinephrine is a non-selective agonist with affinity for both alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors, which may not have the same effect as more selective beta-agonists. However, studies with more selective beta 2 -agonists including formoterol (as was used in this study) have shown an increase in systemic concentrations of plasma lactate in exercising humans, which suggests a stimulatory action on glycolysis of working skeletal muscles. The increase in V T and V e observed in this study despite improved lung mechanics are consistent with an increased respiratory response to match the peripheral oxygen uptake increase, or from direct central respiratory drive stimulus as has been shown in healthy individuals given intravenous salbutamol.

### Adverse effects of β-blocker therapy for patients with heart failure… [^113Raxrx]. JAMA Network (2004). Excellent credibility.

Results β-Blocker therapy was associated with significant absolute annual increases in risks of hypotension, dizziness, and bradycardia. Although the use of β-blocker therapy was once thought to be contraindicated in patients with heart failure with systolic dysfunction, studies have shown that it reduces mortality and hospitalizations in this population. 1–4 Systematic overviews of β-blocker trials in patients with HF have demonstrated reductions in mortality of approximately 30%, 5 and recently published clinical practice guidelines strongly recommend the use of β-blockers. 6, 7 The same clinical guidelines, however, highlight common cardiovascular adverse effects associated with β-blocker therapy including HF deterioration, hypotension, dizziness, bradycardia, and fatigue.

The objective of the present study was to quantify the risks of common, potentially serious cardiovascular adverse effects of β-blocker therapy in patients with HF with systolic dysfunction. To address this issue, we performed an overview of the randomized controlled trials of patients with HF comparing β-blockers with placebo. We compared the risk of withdrawal for any reason in patients randomized to β-blocker therapy with that of patients randomized to placebo. In addition, we determined the risks of specific adverse effects including HF deterioration, hypotension, dizziness, bradycardia, and fatigue. This information will allow practitioners and patients to place the risks of β-blocker therapy in proper perspective. The principal finding of our quantitative overview is that despite concerns about adverse effects, fewer patients with HF assigned to receive β-blockers were withdrawn from therapy than were those assigned to receive placebo.

This difference was primarily owing to a reduction of worsening HF associated with β-blocker therapy. β-Blockers were associated with increased risks of hypotension, dizziness, and bradycardia, although most patients did not experience these adverse effects. In conclusion, β-blocker therapy in patients with HF was well tolerated and associated with fewer overall withdrawals and less HF deterioration than placebo. β-Blocker therapy was associated with small absolute increased risks of hypotension, dizziness, and bradycardia but not of fatigue. Our findings should alleviate concerns of physicians who are reluctant to prescribe β-blockers because of their cardiovascular adverse effects and support the implementation of this lifesaving therapy to appropriate candidates with HF.

### Why has positive inotropy failed in chronic heart failure? Lessons from prior inotrope trials [^1161Ber2]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2019). Medium credibility.

Basic mechanisms of cardiac contractility

The purpose of inotropic interventions in heart failure is to increase the muscular contractile force of the myocardium. 5 Current approaches to increasing contractility are accomplished primarily through increasing the influx of calcium or maintaining higher calcium levels in the cytosol of cardiac myocytes during an action potential. Much of the mechanistic data in this realm is based on animal models. Contraction occurs in several ways (Figure 1). First, catecholamines increase contractile force largely via the β‐adrenoceptor‐adenylyl cyclase system. 6 Through protein kinase A, the β‐adrenoceptor system phosphorylates L‐type calcium channels to increase calcium influx and ryanodine receptors to increase sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium release, resulting in activation of actomyosin cross‐bridges. Phosphorylation of phospholamban accelerates accumulation of calcium. In addition, relaxation is supported by phosphorylation of troponin I due to reduced calcium sensitivity of troponin C (positive lusitropy). Length‐dependent activation of cross‐bridges — the so‐called 'Frank–Starling mechanism' — plays a role along with contraction frequency‐dependent activation of contractile force, where increasing heart rate causes more calcium to enter the cardiomyocyte for release during the next contraction. At the cross‐bridge level, cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)‐mediated increase in contractility reduces the attachment time of the individual cross‐bridge. As a result, this cAMP‐mediated inotropy increases the rate of force development and rate of relaxation, potentially at the expense of 'energetic efficiency'.

### Treatment of chronic heart failure with β-adrenergic receptor antagonists: a convergence of receptor pharmacology and clinical cardiology [^113Qgeiv]. Circulation Research (2011). Low credibility.

Despite the absence of a systematic development plan, β-blockers have reached the top tier of medical therapies for chronic heart failure. The successful outcome was due to the many dedicated investigators who produced, over a 30-year period, increasing evidence that β-blocking agents should or actually did improve the natural history of dilated cardiomyopathies and heart failure. It took 20 years for supportive evidence to become undeniable, at which time in 1993 the formidable drug development resources of large pharmaceutical companies were deployed into Phase 3 trials. Success then came relatively quickly, and within 8 years multiple agents were on the market in the United States and Europe. Importantly, there is ample room to improve antiadrenergic therapy, through novel approaches exploiting the nuances of receptor biology and/or intracellular signaling, as well as through pharmacogenetic targeting.

### Molecular restoration of β-adrenergic receptor signaling improves contractile function of failing hearts [^111TZ3LP]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

beta-adrenergic receptor (betaAR) antagonists, or beta blockers, are now a part of the standard therapeutic arsenal in the medical management of chronic heart failure (HF). Conversely, betaAR stimulation remains the most efficient way to enhance cardiac contractile function acutely, although long-term inotropic therapy based on enhanced betaAR stimulation is likely detrimental. Although altered betaAR signaling plays a pivotal role in the genesis of HF, the choice to therapeutically agonize or antagonize this receptor pathway remains an area of ongoing investigation. Research from the authors' laboratory as well as other research conducted over the last 10 years has produced evidence to support the fact that "normalizing" the betaAR system at a molecular level and improving signaling, instead of blocking it, leads to significant enhancement of cardiac contractile function and prevents ventricular remodeling in HF. This review summarizes the extensive in vivo animal model experimentation that supports the still-controversial hypothesis that increasing the myocardial density of beta(2)-ARs or, more effectively, inhibiting the activity of the betaAR kinase (also referred to as G-protein-coupled receptor kinase 2), represent potential novel therapeutic strategies for HF.

### Dobutamine potentiates the peripheral chemoreflex in patients with congestive heart failure [^114w1uWC]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2003). Low credibility.

Background

beta-Adrenergic agonists may increase chemoreflex sensitivity to hypoxia in normal humans. Chemoreflex function is important in the pathophysiology of heart failure. Whether the beta-1 agonist dobutamine, which is frequently administered to patients with heart failure, alters their chemoreflex sensitivity is not known.

Methods

We tested the hypothesis that dobutamine increases chemoreflex sensitivity in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) using a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study design. We assessed the influence of dobutamine on minute ventilation and hemodynamics during normoxic breathing and during peripheral chemoreflex deactivation by hyperoxia (100% O(2)) in 9 patients with CHF.

Results

Dobutamine increased minute ventilation in patients with CHF (9.4 ± 0.9 versus 8.4 ± 0.7 L/min, P = 0.005) during normoxia. Peripheral chemoreflex deactivation by hyperoxia suppressed the ventilatory effects of dobutamine (10.4 ± 1.4 L/min for dobutamine versus 10.0 ± 1.2 L/min for placebo, P = 0.34).

Conclusions

Dobutamine increases ventilation during normoxia, but not during hyperoxia in patients with CHF. We conclude that dobutamine enhances peripheral chemoreflex sensitivity in patients with congestive heart failure.

### Abstract… [^113t3npr]. AAFP (2003). Low credibility.

2 angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, 3 and spironolactone 4 have been shown to decrease mortality. Angiotensin-receptor blockers also have been studied in the treatment of heart failure, and several studies have shown significant symptomatic improvement, similar to that associated with ACE inhibitor therapy. However, angiotensin-receptor blockers do not decrease mortality rates in patients with heart failure.
5. MORTALITY Based on a meta-analysis of six studies involving nearly 6, 000 patients, the addition of an angiotensin-receptor blocker to ACE inhibitor therapy is not more effective than ACE inhibitor treatment alone in reducing mortality. 5 The largest study was the Valsartan Heart Failure Trial, 6 a randomized, placebo-controlled trial involving 5, 010 patients over nearly two years.

Patients in Val-HeFT 6 had an ejection fraction of less than 40 percent and a New York Heart Association classification of II to IV. Patients took an ACE inhibitor and/or diuretic, and some patients also took digoxin and beta blockers. In addition to this "background therapy, " patients received valsartan, in a dosage of 40 mg twice daily, titrated to 160 mg twice daily, or placebo. A recently published study, the Candesartan in Heart Failure: Assessment of Mortality and Morbidity -Added study, 7 has shown similar results. In this study, 2, 548 patients with a NYHA classification of II to IV who already were taking an ACE inhibitor were randomized to receive placebo or candesartan up to 32 mg daily. As with the Val-HeFT trial and the meta-analysis, overall death rates were similar with and without candesartan.

SYMPTOMS When added to ACE inhibitor therapy, angiotensin-receptor blockers have little effect on exercise capacity, functional capacity, and quality of life. A number of studies have evaluated the effect of adding angiotensin-receptor blockers to ACE inhibitors to control symptoms of heart failure. In many of these studies, the end points were physiologic events such as plasma norepinephrine levels, aldosterone levels, end systolic/diastolic volumes, and peak exercise capacity. However, more important outcomes are measures of exercise capacity, functional capacity, and quality of life.

### Cardiac contractility modulation: mechanisms of action in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and beyond [^116TaJD1]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Heart failure (HF) is the cardiovascular epidemic of the 21st century. 1 Worldwide the prevalence of HF is estimated to exceed 25 million 2 and its prevalence is rising. The HF epidemic can be explained by the paradox of clinical success, including more effective treatment of acute coronary syndromes, leading to a decrease in mortality following acute myocardial infarction. Unfortunately, this is accompanied by a greater incidence in cardiac dysfunction among survivors. An aging population also contributes to the development of HF, 3 while the growing problems of obesity and diabetes are co‐morbidities that contribute to HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). 4

Chronic HF patients stratified by categories of left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) represent different phenotypes in terms of demographics, clinical presentation, aetiology, mechanical and electrical remodelling, and pharmacotherapies. HF patients are currently classified as HF with reduced EF (HFrEF; EF < 40%), HF with mid‐range EF (HFmrEF; EF 40–49%) and HFpEF (EF ≥ 50%). 5 Despite major improvements in pharmacological and device therapies for HFrEF treatment during the last several decades, the 5‐year survival rate has remained unchanged at 50%. 6, 7, 8 Particularly problematic is that virtually all therapeutic innovations for HF have focused on HFrEF. 9 Results of registry studies imply similar benefits of beta‐blockers and renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system inhibitors in HFmrEF and HFrEF, but such therapies have been unsuccessful in improving long‐term outcomes in HFmrEF and HFpEF patients, 6 highlighting a critical gap in therapeutic options (Table 1). 5, 10 The differential impact of therapies on HFrEF, HFmrEF and HFpEF suggests fundamental differences in the underlying pathophysiology and an incomplete understanding of the mechanisms involved. 11, 12

### Evaluation and management of right-sided heart failure: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^117Lczwz]. Circulation (2018). Medium credibility.

Maintain perfusion in hypotension — In cases of hypotension, a drug with combined inotropic and vasopressor properties may be necessary to maintain adequate perfusion, and dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine are useful adjuncts to augment contractility in the setting of significant hypotension (systolic BP < 80–90 mm Hg), with norepinephrine being a potent α1-receptor agonist that leads to vasoconstriction with less prominent inotropic and chronotropic effects. For refractory hypotension caused by peripheral vasodilation not responding to initial interventions, more pure vasopressors such as arginine vasopressin or phenylephrine may be required, arginine vasopressin causes peripheral vasoconstriction with less impact on PVR and supports glomerular filtration via selective efferent arteriole constriction, and attempts should be made to wean off these treatments as rapidly as possible. Although short-term inotropic agents improve hemodynamics, long-term administration is associated with increased myocardial oxygen consumption and possibly increased mortality, clinical guidelines recommend against the routine use of these agents in hospitalized patients with acute HF, and in rare cases, dobutamine can cause eosinophilic myocarditis with further deterioration of cardiac function.

### Cardioselective β-blockers for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a meta-analysis [^116bECTV]. Respiratory Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Beta-blocker therapy has a mortality benefit in patients with hypertension, heart failure and coronary artery disease, as well as during the perioperative period. These drugs have traditionally been considered contraindicated in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The objective of this study was to assess the effect of cardioselective beta-blockers on respiratory function of patients with COPD. Comprehensive searches were performed of the EMBASE, MEDLINE and CINAHL databases from 1966 to May 2001, and identified articles and related reviews were scanned. Randomised, blinded, controlled trials that studied the effects of cardioselective beta-blockers on the forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) or symptoms in patients with COPD were included in the analysis. Interventions studied were the administration of beta-blocker, given either as a single dose or for longer duration, and the use of beta2-agonist given after the study drug. Outcomes measured were the change in FEV1 from baseline and the number of patients with respiratory symptoms. Eleven studies of single-dose treatment and 8 of continued treatment were included. Cardioselective beta-blockers produced no significant change in FEV1 or respiratory symptoms compared to placebo, given as a single dose (-2.05% [95% CI, -6.05% to 1.96%]) or for longer duration (-2.55% [CI, -5.94% to 0.84]), and did not significantly affect the FEV1 treatment response to beta2-agonists. Subgroup analyses revealed no significant change in results for those participants with severe chronic airways obstruction or for those with a reversible obstructive component. In conclusion, cardioselective beta-blockers given to patients with COPD do not produce a significant reduction in airway function or increase the incidence of COPD exacerbations. Given their demonstrated benefit in conditions such as heart failure, coronary artery disease and hypertension, cardioselective beta-blockers should be considered for patients with COPD.

What's new?

We explored β 2 ‐agonist salbutamol inhalation to identify those at risk of abnormal cardiac repolarization during hypoglycaemia. We describe the electrophysiological effects of nebulized salbutamol and a hypoglycaemic clamp in people with Type 1 diabetes.
We confirm that both salbutamol and hypoglycaemia have pro‐arrhythmogenic electrophysiological effects.
The magnitude of electrophysiological changes induced by these two stimuli did not show any relationship as measured by a statistically significant correlation in any of the examined variables.
An individual's electrophysiological response to inhaled salbutamol does not appear useful in predicting their electrophysiological response to hypoglycaemia.

### Association of medication intensity and stages of airflow limitation with the risk of hospitalization or death in patients with heart failure and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^111rAUx7]. JAMA Network Open (2018). Medium credibility.

Medication Intensity Levels

The GOLD guidelines introduce an algorithm for the initiation and escalation for medication prescribing in COPD using a stepped-up approach based on severity. This approach combines airflow limitation stage with history of symptoms and exacerbations to define 4 severity groups (A-D). While the definition of COPD severity for prescribing has changed in the latest GOLD guidelines, the algorithms for medication prescribing are consistent. We used the GOLD guidelines to devise ordered medication intensity levels (Table 1). Exclusive levels ranged from the least severe that included short-acting anticholinergics or β 2 -antagonists only, to mono (GOLD group A), dual (GOLD group B or C), or triple (GOLD group D) therapy using a combination of long-acting anticholinergics, β 2 -antagonists, and inhaled corticosteroids. The GOLD groups B and C were combined owing to their substantial overlap in the guidelines. We also added 2 most severe levels that included oral corticosteroids and oxygen therapy, which are most commonly used following acute exacerbations or in patients with most severe disease. Each medication intensity level was defined by at least 1 of the specified medications prescribed in the 4-month timeframe before the match date to identify all patients with such long-term medication use.

Table 1.
Classifications of COPD Medication Severity

Abbreviations: COPD, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; GOLD, Global Initiative for Obstructive Lung Disease.

COPD Airflow Limitation Stages

The GOLD guidelines recommend the use of forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1) to measure the severity of airflow limitation in COPD. Patients with COPD with routinely recorded spirometry were stratified by 4 severity stages recommended by GOLD: mild, FEV 1 80% or more predicted; moderate, 50% or more FEV 1 but less than 80% predicted; severe, 30% or more FEV 1 but less than 50% predicted; and very severe, FEV 1 less than 30% predicted. The most recent FEV 1 prior to the match date was used within a maximum 3-year timeframe. The median FEV 1 measurement time was 295 days (range, 137–524 days) prior to mortality matching and 247 days (range, 103–280 days) prior to admission matching.

Measurement of Confounders

For potential confounders(eTable 3 in the Supplement), the most recent measurement before the match date was used. Medication measurements were defined by at least 1 prescription in a 4-month timeframe prior to the match date.

### Why has positive inotropy failed in chronic heart failure? Lessons from prior inotrope trials [^114kRixb]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2019). Medium credibility.

Evaluate efficacy based on factors beyond haemodynamics

Whereas haemodynamic measurements are the foundation on which contemporary understanding of heart failure is based, their value for either tailoring or predicting the efficacy of therapeutics has been repeatedly diminished by objective data. Indeed, showing haemodynamic improvements was the rite of passage for almost every positive cardiac inotrope that did not show clinical benefit in a phase 3 clinical trial. Since invasive haemodynamics are onerous to obtain and offer a simplistic snapshot of the cardiac impact of therapeutic interventions, their measurement should not be considered essential in the path to clinical development of a cardiac inotrope.

Collect detailed data on functional status and quality of life

A strong case could be made for the clinical approval of a positive inotrope that improved functional status and quality of life in heart failure patients but had a neutral impact on mortality. Nonetheless, despite the widespread use of inotropes for relief of symptoms, we lack even basic information on these metrics. Prior trials neglected this vital information, choosing instead to focus heavily on physiological and mortality data. Now that heart failure‐specific quality of life questionnaires have been developed and validated, future trials should be designed around outcomes that matter to heart failure patients with a focus on the 'patient journey' rather than an inordinate focus only on the risk of death or hospitalization. 101 The use of mobile health technologies can allow for this to be done in a cheaper and more streamlined fashion while concurrently collecting granular data on individual patients. 102 Importantly, the FDA has indicated that approvability of inotrope therapies could be based on improvement in symptoms even if no clear adversity in survival is found. The lack of such approvals is largely a function of deficient data rather than regulatory philosophy.

### Is there a problem with inhaled long-acting β-adrenergic agonists? [^114YCAVy]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2006). Low credibility.

Short-acting beta(2)-agonists are effective in relieving acute symptoms of asthma and in the short-term prevention of symptoms from stimuli, such as exercise. They are ineffective when used on a regular schedule to improve asthma control. Long-acting beta(2)-agonists, on the other hand, provide sustained bronchodilation and improve asthma control. Regular use of long-acting beta(2)-agonists is not associated with significant tolerance to their bronchodilator action, impairment in the response to albuterol, decreased baseline pulmonary function, increased response to methacholine, or increased risk of adverse cardiac events. Case-control studies do not suggest an increased risk for death or intensive care unit admissions with use of long-acting beta(2)-agonists. In prospective studies in which there has been an increase in asthma deaths or serious asthma exacerbations, this increased risk has not been observed in subjects using inhaled corticosteroids. Where increased deaths have occurred in relation to either short- or long-acting beta(2)-agonists, the events have not occurred equally throughout the exposed population. This suggests that these outcomes were not a direct toxic effect of the drugs and increases the possibility that they resulted from an interaction between relief of symptoms by beta(2)-agonists and delay in seeking medical care.

### Drugs that may cause or exacerbate heart failure: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^115f2DtN]. Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Definitions of evaluation criteria for drug-related heart failure (HF) categorize magnitude as follows: major effects are life-threatening or lead to hospitalization or emergency room visit; moderate effects can lead to an additional clinic visit, change in New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class, change in cardiac function, or worsening cardiovascular disease and can warrant a permanent change in the long-term medication regimen; minor effects lead to increased assessment/surveillance or symptoms that warrant a transient medication change. Levels of evidence are defined as Level A (multiple populations evaluated; data from multiple randomized, controlled trials or meta-analyses), Level B (limited populations evaluated; data from a single randomized, controlled trial or nonrandomized studies), and Level C (very limited populations evaluated; case reports, case studies, expert opinion, and consensus opinion). Onset of effect is defined as immediate when demonstrated within 1 wk of drug administration, intermediate when demonstrated within weeks to months, and delayed when demonstrated within ≥ 1 y of drug administration.

Table 3
Effects of treatment with salmeterol and fluticasone on mortality

*Data were analyzed according to a factorial design to estimate the main effect of each drug with adjustment for the other

Clinical studies have demonstrated that both formoterol and salmeterol are well tolerated, over periods of at least a year. Commonly occurring LABA class effects include palpitations, headache and tremor, which may limit the dose that can be tolerated, especially in some older patients. Cardiovascular side effects are also possible in susceptible patients, and there is some risk associated with the use of β 2 -agonists in patients with COPD and concomitant cardiac diseases, particularly chronic heart failure.

Chronic heart failure is a frequent comorbidity in patients with COPD. Cazzola et al reported that COPD patients in Italy were at increased risk of chronic heart failure compared with the general population (7.9% compared with 2%), while in a Scottish study, 11.9% patients with COPD also had chronic heart failure. Older individuals were at even higher risk in both studies. Moreover, heart failure may be under-diagnosed in COPD due to diagnostic confusion between the two diseases. Research by Au et al. indicates a strong trend towards a dose-response relationship of increased hospitalization and death, due to heart failure in patients with underlying heart failure who received increasing amounts of β 2 -agonist. Thus it is important that physicians should exercise caution in using high doses of β 2 -agonists in such patients.

However, studies specifically investigating safety have demonstrated that formoterol and salmeterol have good cardiovascular safety profiles. Further, studies with formoterol found a similar profile irrespective of device or formulation. In a large cohort of patients with no or stable cardiac comorbidities, the proportion of patients with treatment-emergent atrial tachycardia ranged from 27%-32% and was non-significantly higher, by 2%-5% (p = 0.70), in patients receiving salmeterol or arformoterol compared with placebo; more serious arrhythmias did not increase, nor did mean heart rate.

Electrophysiologic and hemodynamic variables were measured in 10 healthy volunteers during atrial pacing at baseline and during infusion of salbutamol at two different rates (0.1 and 0.2 microg/kg/min). To characterize beta2-agonist effects, a comparison was made with the beta1-selective agonist dobutamine. Salbutamol infusion produced significant changes in electrophysiologic properties in both myocardial and nodal tissues, with significantly greater effects on nodal properties. The proportional decreases in AV nodal parameters were more pronounced than in the sinus node (P < 0.001). An interesting result was a significant increase in the duration of the QS interval, which in the presence of an unchanged His-Purkinje conduction (HV) represents slower depolarization of the ventricle. QT dispersion also increased.

Conclusion

Infusion of salbutamol results in significant electrophysiologic effects on most heart structures, proportionally most pronounced in the AV node. Discordant effects on ventricular conduction, which slowed, and the refractoriness of the ventricular myocardium, which shortened, were seen. QT dispersion was increased.

Methods

Study design

This was a partially blinded, single-arm, single centre study in subjects with COPD GOLD stage II or III. The study included a screening visit and two study visits (visit 1 at week 0 and visit 2 at week 4), and one telephone contact at week 2. At the screening visit, eligibility of the subjects was assessed and written informed consent obtained. At visit 1 a complex measurement period with continuous recordings of MSNA, blood pressure, tidal volume, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation and transcutaneous CO 2 were conducted while placebo and 50 μg salmeterol were inhaled by the subjects in a sequential manner. Following visit 1, all subjects were treated with salmeterol 50 μg twice daily for 4 weeks. At visit 2, these observations were repeated without placebo inhalation. The subjects were recruited in a single study centre with the help of two local chest physicians and newspaper advertisements.

Male or female patients aged between 40 and 80 years were eligible to enter the study. A prerequisite for inclusion was COPD GOLD class II or III with a post-bronchodilator spirometry forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1) < 70% predicted, and current or prior history of ≥ 10 pack-years of cigarette smoking. The main exclusion criteria were concomitant active lung diseases other than COPD, exacerbation or hospitalisation due to COPD six weeks prior to screening, frequent exacerbations necessitating therapy with inhaled glucocorticosteroids, non-invasive ventilation, treatment with drugs affecting sympathetic tone (e.g. theophylline), use of systemic glucocorticoids or antibiotics, uncontrolled sleep apnoea syndrome, left heart failure with a left ventricular ejection fraction < 40%, polyneuropathy, or insulin dependent diabetes mellitus.

The study was performed in a partially blinded manner: The patient was blinded to the sequence of study drug administration (i.e. to the fact that lactose was administered as placebo before salmeterol) at visit 1. Furthermore, the researchers evaluating the recorded data were blinded to the subject, visit and intervention. This was done by pseudonymisation of the recorded data sets of each of the five measurement periods (baseline, placebo, salmeterol at visit 1; baseline and salmeterol at visit 2) and removing the time stamps from each recorded file.

### Inhaled β-agonist does not modify sympathetic activity in patients with COPD [^113je9HQ]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

For the first time the effect of an inhaled β2-agonist on MSNA was evaluated. The primary endpoint, a significant difference in MSNA change following salmeterol inhalation versus placebo inhalation was not met. However, MSNA and other measures of neurohumoral activation such as plasma norepinephrine, BRS and aPWV did not change following acute or long-term salmeterol inhalation. These findings are of interest, since previous work in patients with heart failure indicates that neurohumoral activation and sympathoexcitation are linked to mortality.

Effects on heart rate

Our results showing an increase in heart rate of about 4 beats/minute following inhalation of a sympatho-mimetic drug corroborate older studies. Cazzola and colleagues found an increase in heart rate of about 4 beats/minute with salmeterol in COPD patients with cardiovascular disease. Blood pressure was not evaluated in that study. In a recent study using inhaled fluticasone and the long-acting β2-agonist vilanterol in asthma patients, heart rate was acutely increased by 3.4 beats/minute. Long-term use yielded a decrease in heart rate that was greater with placebo. In COPD patients, the same combination had no effect on heart rate or blood pressure. Similarly, the long acting β2-agonist indacaterol at standard doses had no effect on heart rate or blood pressure in COPD patients. The fact that salmeterol treatment was associated with an increase in heart rate without an increase in MSNA in our study suggests that the increase in heart rate is caused by activation of cardiac β-receptors rather than efferent excitatory traffic of the autonomic nervous system.

Increased resting heart rate is related to mortality in patients with COPD and heart failure. Salmeterol as well as other LABA have been successfully used for inhalation therapy in large studies and for a long time. In controlled randomised trials, β2-agonists improve lung function, quality of live and exacerbations in COPD, but a reduction in mortality was never demonstrated. Interestingly, among older COPD patients, starting LABA treatment was associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events in a recent nested case control analysis.

The increasing understanding of βAR dysfunction in heart failure came at a time when there was a long-standing belief that beta-blockers were contraindicated in the setting of heart failure due to their negative inotropic properties. Over time, these views became increasingly challenged, and several major trials in the 1980s and 1990s conclusively demonstrated that beta-blockers substantially improved survival, – although this effect was only observed in beta-blockers that did not have weak partial agonist activity, known as "intrinsic sympathomimetic activity". – Beta-blockers would prove to be immensely successful in the treatment of heart failure, and the story of these adrenoreceptor ligands illustrates the rich history of this family of receptors, the dramatic advances in their understanding over the past century, and the immense therapeutic potential that they hold.

### Heart failure and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease the quandary of beta-blockers and beta-agonists [^112gDe4p]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2011). Low credibility.

The combination of heart failure and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease presents many therapeutic challenges. The cornerstones of therapy are beta-blockers and beta-agonists, respectively. Their pharmacological effects are diametrically opposed, and each is purported to adversely affect the alternative condition. The tolerability of beta-blockade in patients with mild and fixed airflow obstruction likely extends to those with more severe disease. However, the evidence is rudimentary. The long-term influence of beta-blockade on pulmonary function, symptoms, and quality of life is unclear. Low-dose initiation and gradual up-titration of cardioselective beta-blockers is currently recommended. Robust clinical trials are needed to provide the answers that may finally allay physicians' mistrust of beta-blockers in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Beta-agonists are associated with incident heart failure in patients with pulmonary disease and with increased mortality and hospitalization in those with existing heart failure. These purported adverse effects require further investigation. In the meantime, clinicians should consider carefully the etiology of dyspnea and obtain objective evidence of airflow obstruction before prescribing beta-agonists to patients with heart failure.

### Association between chronic heart failure and inhaled β-2-adrenoceptor agonists [^1116aSwB]. American Heart Journal (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Recent reports suggest an association between beta-agonists and the risk of incident chronic heart failure (CHF). We sought to examine the association between inhaled beta-agonists and risk of incident and nonincident heart failure.

Methods

We performed a nested case-control study within the Ambulatory Care Quality Improvement Project (ACQUIP). Case subjects were defined as having had a hospitalization with a primary discharge diagnosis of CHF. Controls were randomly selected from the ACQUIP cohort. The exposure was the number of beta-agonist canisters filled in the 90 days before an index date.

Results

After adjusting for potentially confounding factors, there appeared to be no association between the use of inhaled beta-agonists and the risk of heart failure (1–2 canisters per month, OR 1.3 [95% CI 0.9, 1.8], ≥ 3 canisters per month, 1.1 [95% CI 0.8, 1.6]). However, among the cohort that had a history of CHF, there appeared to be a dose-response association between the number of inhaled beta-agonists and the risk of hospitalization for chronic heart failure (1–2 canisters per month, adjusted OR 1.8 [95% CI 1.1, 3.0], ≥ 3 canisters per month, adjusted OR 2.1 [95% CI 1.2, 3.8]).

Conclusion

beta-Agonists did not appear to be associated with incident heart failure but were associated with risk of CHF hospitalization among those subjects with a previous CHF diagnosis. Although a causal relationship cannot be inferred from these findings, further research is warranted to determine the safety and effectiveness of inhaled beta-agonists for patients with CHF.

### Inhaled β-2 agonist salbutamol and acute lung injury: an association with improvement in acute lung injury [^115w5ScT]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

Conclusion

This preliminary retrospective study demonstrates for the first time that the aerosolized β2 agonist salbutamol at a dose greater than 2.2 mg/day (average dose of 3.72 mg/day) given to mechanically ventilated patients with ALI was associated with more days alive and free of ALI. This possible beneficial association requires prospective studies, such as a rigorous randomized controlled trial, to determine whether inhaled β2 agonists improve relevant outcomes of ALI.

### Intravenous levosimendan vs. dobutamine in acute decompensated heart failure patients on β-blockers [^112CyxG4]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2010). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In conclusion, in HF patients experiencing acute decompensation while receiving optimal β-blocker therapy, a 24 h levosimendan infusion achieved haemodynamic and neurohormonal improvement that lasted beyond the infusion period. The improvement with levosimendan was at least comparable to a 48 h dobutamine infusion at 24 h after the start of the infusion and superior at 48 h. This lasting effect is corroborated by clinical observations indicating a practical advantage over dobutamine.

### Risk of mortality and heart failure exacerbations associated with inhaled β-adrenoceptor agonists among patients with known left ventricular systolic dysfunction [^114qnJyK]. Chest (2003). Low credibility.

Objectives

Recent studies suggest that myocardial beta(2)-adrenoceptors may be important in chronic heart failure. We sought to determine if use of selective beta(2)-agonists was associated with hospitalization for heart failure and all-cause mortality.

Methods

We studied a cohort of patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD). The outcome was the first hospitalization with a primary diagnosis of chronic heart failure or death from any cause. The exposure was the average number of beta-agonist canisters filled per month in the 90 days prior to and 15 days after enrollment.

Results

Among 1,529 subjects, the relative risk (RR) of chronic heart failure hospital admission associated with inhaled beta-agonists followed a dose-response relationship: RR for one canister per month, 1.4 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.9 to 2.0), RR for two canisters per month, 1.7 (95% CI, 1.2 to 2.5), and RR for three canisters per month, 2.1 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.1). The RR of death demonstrated a similar finding: RR for one canister per month, 0.9 (95% CI, 0.5 to 1.5), RR for two canisters per month, 1.3 (95% CI, 0.9 to 2.1), and RR for three canisters per month, 2.0 (95% CI, 1.3 to 3.1). Adjusting for potential confounding factors did not affect the estimates.

Conclusion

Among subjects with LVSD, inhaled beta-agonists were associated with an increased risk of heart failure hospitalization, and all-cause mortality. Clinicians should carefully consider the etiology of dyspnea when prescribing beta-agonists to patients with LVSD.

### Metabolic and cardiorespiratory effects of decreasing lung hyperinflation with budesonide / formoterol in COPD: a randomized, double-crossover, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial [^113ocBpP]. Respiratory Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Interestingly, very few studies have evaluated the acute effect of inhaled beta-agonists on respiratory and cardiac function at rest in patients with COPD, even though inhaled beta 2 -agonists are among the most widely used agents in the treatment of patients with COPD and asthma. We found only 2 studies evaluating the effect of inhaled therapy containing inhaled beta-agonists on respiratory and cardiac function at rest in patients with COPD, but they were completed after days of therapy. Both studies attributed the increase in heart volume as well as increased vascularity as a beneficial response of the heart due to a decrease in the load imposed by the baseline hyperinflation of the thorax, once lung volumes decreased. However, resting VO 2 reflecting peripheral oxygen uptake and respiratory function (minute ventilation) were not measured in either of the studies; therefore, it is possible that the increase in cardiac chamber size and output resulted from an adaptive response to the increased metabolic demand caused by the action of the beta-agonists on the muscle compartment. The improved cardiac function reported in those 2 studies may not be solely due to mechanical unloading of the heart with lung deflation; this is supported by the lack of relationship between improved lung function, including better IC, and the cardiac parameters in those reports. Consistent with those studies, we observed no relationship between improved lung mechanics and cardiac function. It remains possible that repeated doses of budesonide/formoterol may alter this acute response, as has been shown for 8 weeks of therapy with salbutamol.

This discussion is not meant to imply that decreasing lung volumes is not beneficial when they are the cause of poor cardiac function, as has been shown in over-ventilated patients with airflow limitations in the acute care setting and in patients who have undergone surgical or non-surgical lung volume reduction. Interestingly, in contrast to our findings, the resting VO 2 reported after surgical lung volume reduction is lower and not higher as we have shown in this report. It could be argued whether an increase of 10 ml/min in oxygen uptake is clinically significant. However, patients with COPD spend over 80% of the day at rest, and this seemingly small difference per minute corresponds to 12.4 l of oxygen per day. Importantly, the increase in minute ventilation needed to match the increased oxygen demand observed was 0.862 l per minute. Over the 19 h patients with COPD would typically spend at rest, the daily increase in minute ventilation would be 982 l, a not insignificant amount in patients with a mean FEV 1 of 1.46 l.

### Beta2 adrenergic agonists in acute lung injury? The heart of the matter [^113fWMLK]. Critical Care (2009). Low credibility.

Despite extensive research into its pathophysiology, acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ALI/ARDS) remains a devastating syndrome with mortality approaching 40%. Pharmacologic therapies that reduce the severity of lung injury in vivo and in vitro have not yet been translated to effective clinical treatment options, and innovative therapies are needed. Recently, the use of beta2 adrenergic agonists as potential therapy has gained considerable interest due to their ability to increase the resolution of pulmonary edema. However, the results of clinical trials of beta agonist therapy for ALI/ARDS have been conflicting in terms of benefit. In the previous issue of Critical Care, Briot and colleagues present evidence that may help clarify the inconsistent results. The authors demonstrate that, in oleic acid lung injury in dogs, the inotropic effect of beta agonists may recruit damaged pulmonary capillaries, leading to increased lung endothelial permeability.

### Bronchodilators in heart failure patients with COPD: is it time for a clinical trial? [^1168jRCZ]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2012). Low credibility.

Chronic heart failure (HF) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) commonly coexist, and patients with both diseases fare worse than those with either disease alone. Several factors may contribute to worse outcomes, including an increased burden of care related to greater disease complexity, an overlap of symptoms resulting in misapplication of therapy, and the adverse effects of treatment for one disease on the symptoms and outcomes related to the other. For example, there are conflicting data about the cardiovascular risks of bronchodilators in HF patients who may experience worse outcomes with inhaled beta-2 agonists via arrhythmogenesis, ischemia, and/or attenuation of beta-blocker benefits. In contrast, the long-acting anticholinergic class of bronchodilators has a more reassuring safety profile. Anticholinergic bronchodilators may be the preferred first-line agents for COPD patients with comorbid HF, yet data supporting these recommendations are limited. Therapeutic trials in COPD patients have generally excluded patients with significant HF and vice-versa. This paper reviews bronchodilator therapy in HF and proposes a randomized trial designed to enroll patients with significant COPD and HF to determine the risks and/or benefits of adding a long-acting beta-2 agonist to patients currently taking a long-acting anticholinergic agent.

### Cardiovascular safety of salmeterol in COPD [^1129ZG8J]. Chest (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with COPD have an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Despite the clinical benefits of long-acting beta-agonist agents in the treatment of COPD, patients may be at an increased risk of cardiovascular toxicity, including tachyarrhythmia due to beta-adrenergic stimulation.

Objective

To evaluate the cardiovascular safety of salmeterol in COPD patients by conducting a pooled analysis of cardiovascular safety data.

Design

Randomized, double-blind, parallel group, multiple-dose studies, which included salmeterol, 50 micro g bid, and placebo arms.

Study Selection

Seven of a total of 17 studies met the predefined inclusion requirements and were pooled. A total of 1,443 patients received placebo, while 1,410 patients received salmeterol, 50 micro g bid. The median duration of treatment was 24 weeks (range, 12 to 52 weeks).

Results

Treatment with salmeterol, 50 micro g bid, showed no increased risk of cardiovascular adverse events (AEs) compared with placebo (relative risk, 1.03; 95% confidence interval, 0.8 to 1.3; p = 0.838). Both groups had a similar incidence of cardiovascular events (8%), including cardiovascular deaths. The incidence of cardiovascular AEs increased with age, concurrent cardiovascular conditions, and treatment with antiarrhythmic/bradycardic agents, although increases were comparable in both treatment groups. There were no episodes of sustained ventricular tachycardia, and no clinically significant differences were observed in 24-h heart rate, ventricular and supraventricular ectopic events, qualitative ECGs, QT intervals, or vital signs between the salmeterol, 50 micro g bid, group and the placebo group. Similar findings were observed when patients were stratified for age of > 65 years or the known presence of cardiovascular disease.

Conclusions

Treatment with salmeterol, 50 micro g bid, does not increase the risk of cardiovascular AEs in this population of COPD patients compared with placebo.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^116Ss43c]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Beta2-agonists — adverse effects in COPD — are described as follows. Stimulation of beta2-adrenergic receptors can produce resting sinus tachycardia and has the potential to precipitate cardiac rhythm disturbances in susceptible patients; exaggerated somatic tremor is troublesome in some older patients at higher doses; hypokalemia can occur and oxygen consumption can be increased in chronic heart failure, but these metabolic effects decrease over time; mild falls in partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) can occur after SABAs and LABAs with uncertain clinical significance; and despite prior concerns, no association between beta2-agonist use and loss of lung function or increased mortality has been reported in COPD.

### Why has positive inotropy failed in chronic heart failure? Lessons from prior inotrope trials [^112y826F]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2019). Medium credibility.

Increasing contractility rather than improving efficiency

At the core of arguments about whether it is worth developing positive inotropes for heart failure is an unresolved debate about whether stimulating the failing heart is truly beneficial. 80 It is possible that decreased contractility is a compensatory response aimed at preventing disease progression. If this is the case, then positive inotropes might improve cardiac performance in the short term but are likely to increase the risk of pump failure when used in a chronic manner. However, as our clinical experience with cardiac resynchronization therapy has shown, focusing on the efficiency rather than simply the contractility of the heart has the potential to both improve patient symptoms and clinical outcomes. 95 Since heart failure is a state of dysfunctional cardiac energetics — the so‐called 'engine out of fuel' — it is possible that biomarkers including metabolic assessments could serve as surrogate measures of whether a positive inotrope is helping or hindering the heart efficiency. 96 Furthermore, interventions aimed at increasing high energy phosphate production have resulted in a safe and significant effect on cardiac contractility and exercise capacity. 97 In future clinical trials, patients who are likely to benefit from positive inotropy might be identified via a run‐in period with intensive biomarker and imaging assessments that track well with clinical outcomes (Figure 3).

### Clinical reasoning amongst paramedics using nebulised β ₂ agonists to treat acute asthma exacerbations: a qualitative study [^1155EHxb]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Severity of side effects

All participants reported that the most commonly observed side effect when administering nebulised salbutamol was cardiac abnormalities. Participants further confirmed that an overall increase in heart rate is common, which may lead to ultimate tachycardia.

'I'd say that the most obvious ones that I would find are measurable changes in heart rate and blood pressure from the B 2 stimulation. I would say with all adults that I am continuously monitoring, I'd be surprised if there wasn't an increase in heart rate and usually blood pressure as well'. (16211)

These cardiac changes do not always occur in isolation, with most participants stating that muscle tremors, although not present in every patient, are commonly witnessed.

'Like I say, I'd see tremors in one in every five patients I give salbutamol to… The same with tachycardia, I see that maybe every two or three'. (16111)

'I would say about fifty percent of the time the patient ends up with like tremors or shaking'. (4736)

Although increased heart rate was the main side effect, participants did not necessarily see it as a potential problem. Half of the participants would only raise concern when rates reach levels of supraventricular tachycardia (a rate of > 150 bpm). To clarify this, several participants said that these effects mainly depend on the patients themselves, taking into account individual characteristics and the different presentations witnessed.

'I think if the patient became symptomatic and if the patient decompensates with it, then I would probably stop, but I suppose I look at ABC's and if I'm still significantly concerned about the wheezing and stuff'. (1619)

'If their heart rate gets too high the risk is that they may have cardiac issues as well, so it's a balancing act'. (1617)

### Evaluation and management of right-sided heart failure: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^113DDcH7]. Circulation (2018). Medium credibility.

Augment contractility — inotropes should be considered when CO or BP are inadequate, as in broad terms they augment myocardial contractility and augment failing RV SV while reducing RV end-diastolic volume and pressure; milrinone and dobutamine have combined inotropic and vasodilator properties and can precipitate or worsen hypotension, although this is less likely if LV preload is adequate and their use results in improved CO; direct comparisons show similar clinical outcomes, including similar hemodynamic efficacy and arrhythmogenic potential; compared with dobutamine, milrinone leads to greater reductions in RV and LV end-diastolic pressure, less commonly causes tachycardia, may be considered a more rational choice with concomitant β-blocker therapy, and is less prone to drug tolerance during prolonged infusions; however, milrinone is more likely than dobutamine to provoke hypotension, bolus-related and less easily reversed by discontinuation, and given the long half-life vasopressor support may be necessary, with renal clearance necessitating consideration of estimated glomerular filtration rate for dosing.

### Beta agonists may slightly increase the risk of adverse cardiac events… [^116pyi6H]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

There has long been concern that beta agonists may increase the risk of adverse cardiovascular events, particularly in patients with COPD. Observational studies have found an association, although they cannot prove causation. This study is a meta-analysis of randomized, placebo-controlled trials of beta agonists in the treatment of asthma or COPD. Adverse cardiovascular events included a wide variety of events, from the relatively benign to the more serious, major events. Two reviewers independently abstracted data, the quality of studies was evaluated, and analysis was appropriate. The authors found 13 single-dose trials that included 232 patients and 20 trials of longer duration that included 6, 623 patients who met the study criteria.

The average length of the longer duration trials was 4. 7 months. The single-dose trials showed a minor increase in heart rate and a clinically unimportant decrease in the level of serum potassium. Results of the longer duration trials showed an increased risk of any adverse cardiovascular event, largely caused by an increase in the risk of sinus tachycardia. The likelihood of major cardiovascular events increased but was not statistically significant. In absolute terms, 1, 742 patients in the beta-agonist group had 15 major events, compared with seven events among 1, 347 patients in the placebo group. Although the study designs were different for the trials of longer duration, the results were statistically homogeneous.

Bottom Line: This study provides some evidence that use of beta agonists increases the risk of adverse cardiovascular events in patients taking them for asthma or COPD. Most of these events are trivial, and the absolute increase in the risk of a major cardiovascular event is low.
