## Question

High pth low vitamin d work

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the workup, interpretation, and management of a "High PTH, Low Vitamin D" scenario, including distinguishing secondary from primary hyperparathyroidism and outlining evidence-based thresholds, consequences, and treatment strategies. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the biochemical definition and the most likely etiologies. Then, I should verify the pathophysiology linking vitamin D, calcium, and PTH. Next, I will examine the evidence for vitamin D thresholds that suppress PTH and note where prior assumptions may not hold. After that, I need to differentiate secondary from primary hyperparathyroidism in the setting of vitamin D deficiency. Finally, I should confirm management strategies, monitoring, special situations such as CKD, and summarize controversies and a practical bedside algorithm.

> Let me first confirm the clinical pattern. "High PTH, low vitamin D" typically means PTH above the assay upper limit (often > 65 pg/mL) with 25-hydroxyvitamin D below 20 ng/mL, which most commonly reflects secondary hyperparathyroidism due to vitamin D deficiency or low calcium intake, though I should not forget that primary hyperparathyroidism can coexist with vitamin D deficiency and masquerade as secondary disease, especially if calcium is high-normal or intermittently elevated [^1144Ymwq] [^116feLqL].

> Now, I need to check the physiology to ensure the causal chain makes sense. Vitamin D deficiency reduces intestinal calcium absorption, lowering ionized calcium stimulus at the calcium-sensing receptor, which triggers PTH secretion; PTH then increases renal 1α-hydroxylase activity to raise 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, increases renal calcium reabsorption, and promotes bone resorption to normalize serum calcium, thereby establishing an inverse relationship between 25(OH)D and PTH across populations [^116feLqL] [^111j9dXD].

> Hold on, let me verify the debated "threshold" of 25(OH)D at which PTH plateaus. Earlier reports suggested a plateau around 30–40 ng/mL, which I initially took as a practical target, but a massive cross-sectional dataset of 312,962 paired measurements did not find a clear inflection point, implying continued albeit diminishing PTH suppression at higher 25(OH)D levels; in contrast, an Israeli cohort showed a plateau near 31.6 ng/mL overall that shifted to about 18.5 ng/mL after excluding hypercalcemia or renal failure, so I should be cautious in applying a single threshold across settings [^113XzAhL] [^111x32aB].

> I should double-check how guideline targets align with this heterogeneity. The Institute of Medicine concluded that 25(OH)D ≥ 20 ng/mL meets the requirements of nearly all individuals for skeletal health, whereas the Endocrine Society and primary hyperparathyroidism guidelines favor maintaining levels above 30 ng/mL, acknowledging that PTH suppression may continue beyond this but with uncertain added clinical benefit, so a pragmatic approach is to individualize targets based on risk and comorbidity [^1128upyg] [^111H4sYr].

> Next, I will examine how to distinguish secondary from primary hyperparathyroidism in this context. I need to ensure a careful biochemical pattern review: in secondary hyperparathyroidism from vitamin D deficiency, calcium is typically low or low-normal with elevated PTH, whereas in primary hyperparathyroidism the calcium is high or high-normal with inappropriately elevated PTH; vitamin D deficiency can mask hypercalcemia, yielding "normocalcemic PHPT", so repeating calcium, correcting vitamin D cautiously, and reassessing PTH and calcium are critical to avoid misclassification [^116feLqL] [^117NCNWB].

> Wait, let me verify population data that quantify how common this pattern is and the role of age. In the large reference-lab study, 27% had 25(OH)D < 20 ng/mL and a substantial fraction had elevated PTH, with PTH rising progressively as 25(OH)D fell; PTH also increased with age independent of vitamin D status, which I need to account for when interpreting "mild" PTH elevations in older adults [^113XzAhL].

> I will now examine skeletal consequences to confirm clinical relevance. Secondary hyperparathyroidism increases bone turnover — especially cortical bone resorption — contributing to osteopenia, osteoporosis, and fractures, with the best fracture reduction demonstrated when vitamin D is combined with calcium in institutionalized elderly, while vitamin D alone is inconsistent; observational data suggest BMD benefits near 30–32 ng/mL and possible U-shaped associations at higher levels, so more is not always better [^1165kh6X] [^114dqZii] [^111SMwSw] [^114tvLJq].

> Let me consider extraskeletal signals. Elevated PTH has been associated with increased heart failure risk and with higher all-cause mortality in population analyses, sometimes independent of 25(OH)D and calcium, but I should be careful not to infer causality from observational data; these findings reinforce the value of correcting reversible drivers of PTH elevation without aggressively overshooting vitamin D targets [^114ooyVG] [^111YQd6C].

> Next, I should review repletion strategies and formulations. For deficiency, typical repletion uses cholecalciferol or ergocalciferol such as 50,000 IU weekly for about 8 weeks followed by maintenance 1,500–2,000 IU daily, with D3 generally producing greater rises in total and free 25(OH)D and stronger PTH suppression than D2; calcifediol raises 25(OH)D more rapidly and can lower PTH efficiently, which may be useful when prompt correction or specific pharmacokinetics are desired, especially in certain malabsorptive or hepatic contexts [^1144Ymwq] [^114tvLJq] [^116J3h4r] [^112diNkt] [^117JcNCy].

> Hold on, I should verify the monitoring cadence and safety targets. Baseline labs should include 25(OH)D, PTH, corrected calcium, phosphorus, and creatinine, with reassessment at 8–12 weeks to confirm that 25(OH)D has risen toward the individualized target and that PTH has declined without hypercalcemia; in PHPT, many guidelines advise maintaining 25(OH)D above 30 ng/mL but below the lab upper limit, with close calcium monitoring during repletion to avoid exacerbating hypercalcemia [^1144Ymwq] [^111H4sYr].

> I need to ensure I address the primary hyperparathyroidism interface. Vitamin D deficiency can worsen PHPT severity and obscure diagnosis, so careful repletion to 25(OH)D > 30 ng/mL without provoking hypercalcemia is recommended preoperatively and postoperatively, both to reduce PTH drive and to mitigate hungry bone risk after parathyroidectomy; endocrine surgery referral should follow established criteria once PHPT is confirmed [^117NCNWB] [^111xKeoN] [^114N1rPP] [^111H4sYr].

> For CKD, let me reconsider the distinct pathophysiology. Secondary hyperparathyroidism begins early as renal 1α-hydroxylation declines and phosphate handling changes; nutritional vitamin D repletion can be appropriate for low 25(OH)D, but active vitamin D receptor agonists such as calcitriol or paricalcitol are often needed in stages 3–5 to suppress PTH, with vigilant monitoring for hypercalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, and Ca×P product elevation to avoid vascular calcification [^113XYz52] [^114qfj9J] [^1165jeuf] [^116feLqL].

> But wait, what about assay issues and "free" versus "total" 25(OH)D? I should double-check that assay variability and binding-protein polymorphisms can confound interpretation; LC-MS/MS provides better accuracy, and emerging data suggest early PTH suppression may correlate more closely with rises in free 25(OH)D during repletion, although both free and total track with PTH over longer intervals, which cautions me to interpret thresholds with methodological context in mind [^1121TDLd] [^117JcNCy] [^112diNkt].

> Hmm, wait a minute, there are a few paradoxes and U-shaped signals I should acknowledge. Very high 25(OH)D levels have been linked to increased mortality in some observational studies and vitamin D–sufficient children may show a paradoxical PTH rise with supplementation, so I should avoid oversupplementation and tailor dosing to deficiency severity, comorbidity, and age, rather than chasing maximal PTH suppression beyond clinically meaningful targets [^114fwc3g] [^1119CAF7] [^111F3J9h].

> Let me translate this into a practical bedside sequence. If PTH is elevated with low 25(OH)D, I should first verify corrected calcium; if calcium is low or low-normal, secondary hyperparathyroidism is likely and I should replete vitamin D and calcium as needed, then recheck labs in 8–12 weeks expecting PTH to fall; if calcium is high or high-normal, I should consider primary hyperparathyroidism with coexisting vitamin D deficiency, correct vitamin D cautiously, repeat measurements, and if PHPT persists, evaluate per guideline criteria and refer for surgery as indicated [^116feLqL] [^111H4sYr] [^111xKeoN].

> Final synthesis, and let me double-check consistency. In most patients, "high PTH, low vitamin D" reflects secondary hyperparathyroidism driven by vitamin D deficiency along an inverse 25(OH)D–PTH continuum without a universally fixed plateau, whereas a masked primary hyperparathyroidism must be excluded by reviewing calcium, repeating labs after safe vitamin D repletion, and following guideline-directed evaluation; management focuses on correcting vitamin D to at least 20 ng/mL and often above 30 ng/mL with careful calcium surveillance, selecting D3 or calcifediol based on context, and using active vitamin D analogs in CKD when appropriate [^113XzAhL] [^1128upyg] [^111H4sYr] [^1144Ymwq] [^114qfj9J].

---

High PTH with low vitamin D most often reflects **secondary hyperparathyroidism** [^116feLqL] from vitamin D deficiency, with PTH rising as 25(OH)D falls below ~20 ng/mL [^111x32aB] and plateauing near 30 ng/mL. This compensatory PTH increase helps maintain normocalcemia [^111x32aB] but accelerates bone resorption [^1165kh6X], raising fracture risk [^111BX27M]. Management is to **replete vitamin D to ≥ 30 ng/mL** [^111H4sYr], monitor calcium and PTH, and address causes such as malabsorption, CKD, or medications [^114tvLJq] [^113XYz52]. Persistent PTH elevation after correction of vitamin D suggests primary hyperparathyroidism [^111x32aB] or other pathology and warrants further evaluation [^113XzAhL] [^111H4sYr].

---

## Physiological relationship between vitamin D and PTH

- **Vitamin D metabolism**: Vitamin D is converted in the liver to 25(OH)D, then in the kidney to 1,25(OH)2D, which increases intestinal calcium absorption and suppresses PTH [^114qfj9J].

- **PTH regulation**: PTH rises when calcium is low or vitamin D is insufficient, stimulating bone resorption, renal calcium reabsorption, and 1,25(OH)2D production to restore calcium [^116feLqL].

- **Inverse relationship**: PTH rises as 25(OH)D falls [^111j9dXD], with a threshold around 20 ng/mL and a plateau near 30 ng/mL [^111x32aB].

---

## Clinical significance of high PTH and low vitamin D

The most common cause is **secondary hyperparathyroidism** from vitamin D deficiency, characterized by elevated PTH despite normal or low-normal calcium [^116feLqL] [^111x32aB]. Elevated PTH increases bone resorption, lowers BMD, and **increases fracture risk** [^116THhCZ] [^111BX27M]. High PTH is associated with cardiovascular risk [^114ooyVG], metabolic syndrome [^113s2aEd], and mortality, especially in CKD and diabetes.

## Common causes of high PTH and low vitamin D

| **Cause** | **Mechanism** |
|-|-|
| Vitamin D deficiency | Reduced sun exposure, poor intake, malabsorption, obesity, CKD [^114tvLJq] [^1144Ymwq] |
| Chronic kidney disease | Impaired 1,25(OH)2D synthesis, phosphate retention, secondary hyperparathyroidism [^114qfj9J] [^112bosT7] |
| Malabsorption syndromes | Reduced absorption of vitamin D and calcium (e.g. celiac, IBD, bariatric surgery) [^114tvLJq] |
| Medications | Glucocorticoids, anticonvulsants, calcimimetics, vitamin D analogs |
| Primary hyperparathyroidism | Parathyroid adenoma or hyperplasia causing elevated PTH; vitamin D deficiency may coexist [^111x32aB] [^113XzAhL] [^111H4sYr] |

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

- **Laboratory tests**: Measure serum calcium, phosphate, 25(OH)D, 1,25(OH)2D, PTH [^114tvLJq], renal function, and urinary calcium excretion [^111H4sYr].

- **Imaging studies**: Consider DXA for BMD, renal ultrasound for nephrolithiasis, and parathyroid imaging if primary hyperparathyroidism is suspected.

- **Clinical assessment**: Evaluate for symptoms of vitamin D deficiency, hyperparathyroidism, and underlying conditions (e.g. CKD, malabsorption).

---

## Management strategies

- **Vitamin D supplementation**: Replete to ≥ 30 ng/mL [^111H4sYr]; typical regimens include 50,000 IU weekly for 6–8 weeks, then 1,000–2,000 IU daily [^114tvLJq].

- **Calcium supplementation**: Ensure adequate intake (1,000–1,200 mg/day) to support bone health and reduce PTH.

- **Address underlying causes**: Treat malabsorption, manage CKD [^114qfj9J], adjust medications, and consider parathyroidectomy for primary hyperparathyroidism [^111H4sYr].

- **Monitoring**: Recheck calcium, phosphate, PTH, and 25(OH)D every 3–6 months to guide therapy and prevent complications [^114tvLJq].

---

## Clinical outcomes and complications

Elevated PTH with low vitamin D increases bone resorption [^116THhCZ], lowers BMD [^111x32aB], and raises **fracture risk** [^111BX27M]. It is also associated with hypertension, vascular calcification, and cardiovascular events [^113s2aEd], and correlates with **higher all-cause mortality**, particularly in CKD and diabetes [^113R4nWd].

---

High PTH with low vitamin D most often reflects secondary hyperparathyroidism from vitamin D deficiency; **correcting vitamin D** and addressing causes usually normalizes PTH and improves bone and metabolic outcomes [^114tvLJq] [^116THhCZ]. Persistent PTH elevation after vitamin D repletion suggests primary hyperparathyroidism or other pathology and **requires further evaluation** [^111H4sYr].

### Effects of age and serum 25-OH-vitamin D on serum parathyroid hormone levels [^113XzAhL]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

Several studies define optimal serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD) levels based on serum PTH level reaching an asymptote. However, results differ widely, ranging from 25-OHD levels of 12–44 ng/ml. Many studies are constrained by small sample sizes.

The objective was to determine the relationship between serum PTH and 25-OHD levels and age in a very large reference laboratory database. This was a detailed cross-sectional analysis of 312,962 paired serum PTH and 25-OHD levels measured from July 2010 to June 2011.

- **Results**: Median PTH levels and the proportion of patients (PTH > 65 pg/ml) from 63 successive 25-OHD frequency classes of 5000 patients provide smooth, exceptionally well-fitted curves (R² = 0.994 and R² = 0.995, respectively) without discernible inflection points or asymptotes but with striking age dependencies. Serum 25-OHD was below the recent Institute of Medicine sufficiency guidance of 20 ng/ml in 27% (85,000) of the subjects. More importantly, 40% and 51% of subjects had serum 25-OHD deficiency, with PTH levels > 70 pg/ml and > 65 pg/ml, respectively.

- **Conclusions**: This analysis, despite inevitable inherent limitations, introduces several clinical implications. First, median 25-OHD-dependent PTH levels revealed no threshold above which increasing 25-OHD fails to further suppress PTH. Second, the large number of subjects with 25-OHD deficiency and hyperparathyroidism reinforces the Third International Workshop on Asymptomatic Primary Hyperparathyroidism's recommendations to test for, and replete, vitamin D deficiency.

### The relationship between serum 25(OH)D and parathyroid hormone levels [^111x32aB]. The American Journal of Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Low 25(OH)D levels are associated with increased parathyroid hormone levels, leading to progressive bone loss. The serum levels of 25(OH)D sufficient to maintain parathyroid hormone levels within a range that prevents bone loss remain unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the relationship between 25(OH)D levels and concomitant parathyroid hormone levels.

- **Methods**: The computerized laboratory database of Clalit Health Services, a not-for-profit health maintenance organization covering more than half of the Israeli population, was searched for all 25(OH)D and parathyroid hormone tests performed in 2009. Concomitant tests of parathyroid hormone and 25(OH)D were identified in 19,172 people.

- **Results**: Serum parathyroid hormone levels were inversely correlated with 25(OH)D levels (r = −0.176, P < .001). 25(OH)D levels less than 50 nmol/L were associated with a steep increase in parathyroid hormone levels and hyperparathyroidism, which decreased with increasing 25(OH)D levels and reached a plateau at 25(OH)D levels of 75 to 85 nmol/L. The quadratic fit with plateau model showed that parathyroid hormone stabilizes at a 25(OH)D level of 78.9 nmol/L. However, after excluding 5,449 people with hypercalcemia or renal failure, the parathyroid hormone plateau was attained at a significantly lower 25(OH)D cut point of 46.2 nmol/L.

- **Conclusion**: Our data suggest that a 25(OH)D threshold of 50 nmol/L is sufficient for parathyroid hormone suppression and prevention of secondary hyperparathyroidism in persons with normal renal function.

### Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D and the risk of hip and nonspine fractures in older men [^111BX27M]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2010). Low credibility.

Low circulating vitamin D has been shown to affect bone strength. Vitamin D deficiency in milder forms can lead to secondary hyperparathyroidism and subsequently faster rates of bone turnover and bone loss. Positive relationships have been observed between serum 25(OH)D and bone mineral density (BMD). Adjustment for BMD attenuated the association between total 25(OH)D and hip fracture such that the overall trend was borderline significant. Adjustment for BMD completely attenuated the relationship between vitamin D3 level and hip fracture. This suggests that the association between low vitamin D level and increased hip fracture risk is at least in part due to lower hip BMD among the men with low vitamin D levels.

This result differs from the NHANES III study, where the relationship between 25(OH)D and hip fracture was independent of BMD. Low BMD is associated with an increased risk of all nonspine fractures, and if BMD is the mediator, it is somewhat surprising that there was no relationship between 25(OH)D and nonspine fracture. The relationship between BMD and nonspine fracture is, however, weaker than for hip fracture. Further studies are needed to confirm the mechanism underlying the association of 25(OH)D and hip fracture. In particular, future studies should include markers of bone turnover. In women, we observed that high bone resorption may be an important mechanism for the association between low 25(OH)D and hip fracture.

The optimal serum 25(OH)D concentration needed to maintain bone health has not been established. Optimal concentrations have been defined as those at which serum parathyroid hormone normalization occurs.

### Parathyroid disorders [^116feLqL]. American Family Physician (2022). Low credibility.

Parathyroid disorders are most often identified incidentally by abnormalities in serum calcium levels when screening for renal or bone disease or other conditions. Parathyroid hormone, which is released by the parathyroid glands primarily in response to low calcium levels, stimulates osteoclastic bone resorption and serum calcium elevation, reduces renal calcium clearance, and stimulates intestinal calcium absorption through the synthesis of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D.

Primary hyperparathyroidism, in which calcium levels are elevated without appropriate suppression of parathyroid hormone levels, is the most common cause of hypercalcemia and is often managed surgically. Indications for parathyroidectomy in primary hyperparathyroidism include the presence of symptoms, age 50 years or younger, serum calcium level more than 1 mg per dL above the upper limit of normal, osteoporosis, creatinine clearance less than 60 mL per minute per 1.73 m², nephrolithiasis, nephrocalcinosis, and hypercalciuria.

Secondary hyperparathyroidism is caused by alterations in calcium, phosphate, and vitamin D regulation that result in elevated parathyroid hormone levels. It most commonly occurs with chronic kidney disease and vitamin D deficiency, and less commonly with gastrointestinal conditions that impair calcium absorption. Secondary hyperparathyroidism can be managed with calcium and vitamin D replacement and reduction of high phosphate levels. There is limited evidence for the use of calcimimetics and vitamin D analogues for persistently elevated parathyroid hormone levels.

### Evaluation, treatment, and prevention of vitamin D deficiency: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^1144Ymwq]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on vitamin D deficiency: Vitamin D deficiency is defined as a serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level less than 20 ng/mL (50 nmol/L). People living at higher latitudes (above 33° north or south), older adults, pregnant individuals, and patients with obesity are at higher risk.

### Evaluation, treatment, and prevention of vitamin D deficiency: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^114tvLJq]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). High credibility.

The disease vitamin D deficiency can be associated with:

- **Bone and muscle symptoms**: Bone pain, myalgia, muscle weakness, history of fracture, hip pain, osteopenia, osteoporosis, rickets, bowed legs, pectus carinatum, kyphosis
- **Serum and vitamin levels**: Increased serum PTH, decreased serum calcium, decreased serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D
- **Medical and surgical conditions**: Malabsorption, bariatric surgery, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), chronic kidney disease (CKD)
- **Medication influences**: Corticosteroid use, anticonvulsants
- **Demographic and lifestyle factors**: Limited sun exposure, dark skin color

### Vitamin D insufficiency and deficiency in chronic kidney disease. A single center observational study [^113XYz52]. American Journal of Nephrology (2004). Low credibility.

Kidney disease has been identified as a risk factor for vitamin D deficiency in hospitalized patients, and low levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D have been suggested to be a risk factor for hyperparathyroidism in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, little is known about the magnitude of vitamin D deficiency in patients with CKD living in the United States.

- **Methods**: In this regard, we examined the levels of 25(OH)D in 43 patients with CKD and serum creatinine between 1 and 5 mg/dl (calculated glomerular filtration rate 111–11 ml/min per 1.73 m²) as well as in 103 patients undergoing hemodialysis.

- **Results**: In the predialysis patients, we found that 37 of the 43 patients (86%) had suboptimal levels of vitamin D (< 30 ng/ml). Regression analysis indicated that there was a negative correlation between 25(OH)D and intact parathyroid hormone (PTH). Alkaline phosphatase showed a similar but less sensitive relationship. Serum albumin levels correlated with 25(OH)D levels. In contrast to findings reported in normal individuals, the levels of calcitriol correlated with those of 25(OH)D in the patients with CKD. In the group undergoing maintenance hemodialysis, we found that 97% of the patients had vitamin D levels in the suboptimal range, and there was no correlation of 25(OH)D levels with either PTH or serum albumin values. These data indicate that vitamin D insufficiency and deficiency are highly prevalent in patients with CKD and may play a role in the development of hyperparathyroidism.

### Skeletal and extraskeletal actions of vitamin D: Current evidence and outstanding questions [^116THhCZ]. Endocrine Reviews (2019). Low credibility.

Many randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have been conducted involving vitamin D, typically in combination with calcium, focusing on bone mineral density (BMD) and fractures as outcome criteria. The effects on BMD are most pronounced at the femoral neck, with an average increase of 0.8% (range, 0.2% to 1.4%), according to a recent meta-analysis. However, this meta-analysis excluded the Lyon clinical trial, which, in a significantly vitamin D–deficient population, reported a 7.3% difference in total hip BMD between those receiving vitamin D and the control group.

In the large VIDA study conducted in New Zealand with adults whose mean age was 69 years and mean baseline serum 25OHD was 56 nmol/L, a modest BMD increase at the femoral neck of 0.5% was observed in the group treated with 100,000 IU of vitamin D3 per month over two years. Among participants with a baseline serum 25OHD of less than 30 nmol/L, BMD remained stable in those supplemented with vitamin D, whereas a 2% decrease was noted in the control group.

The impact of vitamin D on fracture incidence has been examined in at least 19 RCTs. Vitamin D was administered in various intervals, ranging from daily to once a year. In five of these trials, vitamin D was given alone, and in two, a significant reduction in fracture incidence was observed, either with annual injections or a 4-monthly oral dose. The three other trials with vitamin D alone did not show positive results. In 13 RCTs, the combination of vitamin D and calcium was evaluated. The most significant effect was noted in an initial trial involving a severely deficient French nursing home population (mean age, 84 years) treated with vitamin D3 (800 IU/d) and calcium (1200 mg/d) compared to a double placebo group.

### The American Association of Endocrine Surgeons guidelines for definitive management of primary hyperparathyroidism [^114N1rPP]. JAMA Surgery (2016). High credibility.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for primary hyperparathyroidism, more specifically with respect to vitamin D and calcium supplementation, the AAES 2016 guidelines recommend considering the administration of short-term calcium and/or vitamin D supplementation for prophylaxis against hypocalcemia after parathyroidectomy.

### Association of serum parathyroid hormone levels with all-cause and cause-specific mortality among U.S. adults [^111YQd6C]. Endocrine Practice (2022). Low credibility.

To examine whether parathyroid hormone (PTH) is associated with mortality among U.S. adults, this study included 8,286 U.S. adults aged ≥ 20 years with a measurement of serum intact PTH from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2003–2006 linked to national mortality data through 2015. Multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression models were employed to estimate the adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) of all-cause and cause-specific (cardiovascular and cancer) mortality according to intact PTH levels (low or low-normal, 74 pg/mL). The analyses were also stratified by serum albumin-adjusted calcium and 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25OHD) levels.

During a median follow-up of 10.1 years, the mean age was 49 years, and 48% were men. After adjusting for potential confounders, both the high-normal and high PTH groups showed higher risks of all-cause mortality than the low or low-normal PTH group (high-normal PTH, aHR 1.28; 95% confidence interval, 1.10–1.48; high PTH, aHR 1.42; 95% CI, 1.19–1.69). When stratified by calcium and 25OHD levels, the association between high PTH and mortality was also found among participants with albumin-adjusted calcium levels of ≥ 9.6 mg/dL (aHR 1.53; 95% CI, 1.17–2.01) and those with 25OHD levels of ≥ 20 ng/mL (aHR 1.46; 95% CI, 1.17–1.82). There was no evidence of increased cause-specific mortality risks in the high PTH group.

Higher PTH levels were associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality, particularly among participants with elevated calcium and vitamin D levels.

### Consensus statement on vitamin D status assessment and supplementation: Whys, whens, and hows [^1165kh6X]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). Low credibility.

Skeletal outcomes of vitamin D deficiency are summarized in Fig. 3. Vitamin D deficiency leads to a decrease in intestinal absorption of calcium and phosphate. Other biochemical abnormalities, such as hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia, and an increase in alkaline phosphatase, become apparent when serum 25(OH)D concentrations are lower than 25 nmol/L.

In milder forms of vitamin D deficiency, the lower calcium concentration causes secondary hyperparathyroidism, which increases the conversion of 25(OH)D into 1,25(OH)2D, increasing calcium absorption and correcting serum calcium. Secondary hyperparathyroidism causes an increase in bone turnover, with relatively higher bone resorption at cortical sites.

More severe longstanding vitamin D deficiency causes a decrease in the mineralization of newly formed osteoid tissue. This is visible in bone biopsies as an increase in osteoid surface and volume and increased thickness of osteoid seams, leading to the clinical picture of osteomalacia. Vitamin D deficiency and related secondary hyperparathyroidism cause bone loss and fractures in older adults. The incidence of hip fractures attributable to vitamin D deficiency has been estimated at 5% to 10%.

Meta-analyses of clinical trials with vitamin D and calcium have demonstrated a decrease in hip and other fractures of around 10% in nursing home residents, whereas vitamin D alone was not effective. In these studies, baseline mean serum 25(OH)D after cross-calibration was found to be very low — namely less than 25 nmol/L — as was the calcium intake.

### The 2011 report on dietary reference intakes for calcium and vitamin D from the Institute of Medicine: what clinicians need to know [^1128upyg]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

Guidelines regarding the use of serum markers of vitamin D status for medical management of individual patients and for screening were beyond the scope of the Committee's charge, and evidence-based consensus guidelines are not available. However, these issues should be addressed by appropriate federal agencies and professional organizations in light of the findings in this report. As noted above, the Committee recognized that serum 25OHD is a useful integrated marker of vitamin D exposure, incorporating endogenous synthesis from solar exposure, dietary intake from foods, fortified products, and/or supplements, and other factors. However, the Committee also recognized that observational studies of correlations between 25OHD and clinical outcomes are subject to confounding and do not prove causation. Concerns about inaccurate or imprecise serum 25OHD measurements are being overcome by methodological advances, frequent quality assessments, and accurate calibration tools. In contrast, serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D represents a more complex endocrine parameter, regulated by calcium and PTH status and affected by kidney function. After a careful review of available literature, the Committee concluded that serum 25OHD levels of 16 ng/ml (40 nmol/liter) cover the requirements of approximately half the population, and levels of 20 ng/ml (50 nmol/liter) cover the requirements of at least 97.5% of the population. These levels will be useful to clinicians as they consider management of patients under their care.

### Serum parathyroid hormone and 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations and risk of incident heart failure: The Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis [^114ooyVG]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

We also did not observe an association of 25(OH)D with LVM. Results of prior investigations are conflicting. A study of 1800 participants from Italy did find an association between low 25(OH)D and elevated LVM. However, similar to our results, the studies from the Cardiovascular Health Study and the Netherlands that demonstrated associations of PTH with LVM found no association between 25(OH)D and LVM. Furthermore, the short-term clinical trials completed at the time of writing have demonstrated no improvement of LVM with vitamin D treatments.

- **One possible explanation**: The lack of improvement in HF outcomes with vitamin D supplementation may be because vitamin D supplementation may not be very effective in reducing PTH concentrations. For example, some trials of vitamin D supplementation have demonstrated that although there was a significant increase in 25(OH)D levels, PTH does not significantly decrease.

Overall, mixed results of human studies evaluating 25(OH)D, HF, and LVM temper enthusiasm that 25(OH)D may be a powerful intervention to prevent and treat HF.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for primary hyperparathyroidism, more specifically with respect to vitamin D and calcium supplementation, PHPT-IW-5 2022 guidelines recommend maintaining vitamin D levels greater than 30 ng/mL and below the upper limit of normal (ULN) for the laboratory reference range, which is less than 50 ng/mL.

### Zemplar [^114qfj9J]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Secondary hyperparathyroidism is characterized by an elevation in parathyroid hormone (PTH) associated with inadequate levels of active vitamin D hormone. The source of vitamin D in the body is from synthesis in the skin as vitamin D3 and from dietary intake as either vitamin D2 or D3. Both vitamin D2 and D3 require two sequential hydroxylations in the liver and the kidney to bind to and activate the vitamin D receptor (VDR). The endogenous VDR activator, calcitriol [1,25(OH)2D3], is a hormone that binds to VDRs that are present in the parathyroid gland, intestine, kidney, and bone to maintain parathyroid function, calcium and phosphorus homeostasis, and to VDRs found in many other tissues, including prostate, endothelium, and immune cells. VDR activation is essential for the proper formation and maintenance of normal bone. In the diseased kidney, the activation of vitamin D is diminished, resulting in a rise of PTH, subsequently leading to secondary hyperparathyroidism and disturbances in calcium and phosphorus homeostasis. Decreased levels of 1,25(OH)2D3 have been observed in early stages of chronic kidney disease. The decreased levels of 1,25(OH)2D3 and resultant elevated PTH levels, both of which often precede abnormalities in serum calcium and phosphorus, affect bone turnover rate and may result in renal osteodystrophy.

- **Mechanism of action**: Paricalcitol is a synthetic, biologically active vitamin D2 analog of calcitriol. Preclinical and in vitro studies have demonstrated that paricalcitol's biological actions are mediated through binding.

### Vitamin D, parathyroid hormone and metabolic syndrome - the PORMETS study [^113s2aEd]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2017). Low credibility.

The present study showed a high prevalence of hypovitaminosis D in a sample of the Portuguese population. Compared with other European and worldwide populations, our median level of 25(OH)D (13.8 ng/mL) is relatively low. The prevalence of hypovitaminosis D was higher in participants with higher BMI and sedentary lifestyles.

- **Association with PTH levels**: The PTH levels showed a significant positive association with BMI, WC, and the WC component of MetS, suggesting a possible role in the pathophysiology of obesity. Conversely, 25(OH)D levels were negatively associated with BMI, glucose, and triglycerides levels, as well as with MetS and its BP and triglycerides components, indicating that hypovitaminosis D may contribute to the pathophysiology of MetS.

Considering the low levels and inadequate intake of VitD, the frequency of overweight, and potentially insufficient solar exposure in the Portuguese population, it is crucial to develop national policies to increase awareness of the importance of VitD for health and to develop strategies for identifying vitamin D deficiency, especially in at-risk groups.

### Relationship between vitamin D, parathyroid hormone, and bone health [^111j9dXD]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

There is a controversy regarding the definition of vitamin D insufficiency as it relates to bone health. The objective of the study was to examine the evidence for a threshold value of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) that defines vitamin D insufficiency as it relates to bone health.

This study was a cross-sectional analysis of baseline data in 488 elderly Caucasian women, with a mean age of 71 years, combined with a literature review of 70 studies on the relationship of serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) to serum 25OHD. The study was conducted among independent-living women in the Midwest United States.

- **Main outcome measure**: The relationship between serum 25OHD, serum PTH, serum osteocalcin, and 24-hour urine N-telopeptides was evaluated.

- **Results**: Serum PTH was inversely correlated with serum 25OHD (r = -0.256, P < 0.0005). However, no threshold, as defined by suppression of serum PTH, was found within the serum 25OHD range of 6–60 ng/ml (15–150 nmol/liter). In contrast, there was a threshold for bone markers, serum osteocalcin, and urine N-telopeptides, which increased only below a serum 25OHD of approximately 18 ng/ml (45 nmol/liter). Calcium absorption was not correlated with serum PTH and serum 25OHD, and no threshold was found. A literature review of 70 studies generally showed a threshold for serum PTH with increasing serum 25OHD, but there was no consistency in the threshold level of serum 25OHD, which varied from 10 to 50 ng/ml (25–125 nmol/liter).

- **Conclusions**: Vitamin D insufficiency should be defined as serum 25OHD less than 20 ng/ml (50 nmol/liter).

### Use and indication of vitamin D and vitamin D analogues in patients with renal bone disease [^112bosT7]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2002). Low credibility.

Vitamin D plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis and treatment of renal bone disease. Vitamin D levels decline in the early phase of renal failure; however, through a compensatory mechanism, parathyroid hormone (PTH) stimulates the production of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) (1,25(OH)(2)D(3), calcitriol) to return it to normal circulating concentrations. Nevertheless, resistance to calcitriol is observed and may be related to the decreased presence of the heterodimeric, DNA-binding partner for the vitamin D receptor protein. In end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), the circulating levels of calcitriol are invariably low.

The indications for vitamin D therapy are the replacement of the missing hormone versus the suppression of hyperparathyroidism (HPT), requiring daily low-dose oral versus intermittent 'pulse' oral administration. However, this therapy must be accompanied by careful patient monitoring to avoid hypercalcaemia and low bone turnover. Low bone turnover is not merely a histologic entity but a clinical condition associated with a high risk of extraosseous calcifications, particularly in the cardiovascular system, leading to increased morbidity. Thus, determination of bone turnover in patients with ESKD is essential.

Bone biopsy is the gold standard to assess bone turnover; however, it is not always available, and nephrologists rely on PTH levels. The intact PTH assay measures PTH(1–84) and large C-PTH fragments, which may antagonize the PTH(1–84) effects on bone. An assay that measures exclusively PTH(1–84) has recently become available, and a calculated PTH(1–84)/C-PTH fragment ratio is increasingly used to better diagnose and manage these patients.

### Association of serum parathyroid hormone within normal range with the prevalence and prognosis among adults with diabetes and prediabetes: Insight from NHANES 2003–2006 data [^113R4nWd]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

As this is an observational study, our analysis should be regarded as exploratory in nature. At the time of writing, no empirical evidence has demonstrated the potential clinical benefits of therapy for individuals with PTH levels within the normal range, and it is not possible to state a causal relationship between PTH and the onset of diabetes or death from our study. Overall, significant variations in prognosis among diabetic or prediabetic populations with varying degrees of PTH suggest the potential advantages of maintaining low PTH levels for long-term prognosis. Lowering targeted circulating PTH concentrations may potentially mitigate the unfavorable prognosis in hyperglycemic populations. Therapies that target the modulation of PTH levels, including the use of vitamin D supplementation and calcium intake, are readily available and can be integrated into clinical practice.

As far as we are aware, this research marks the pioneering exploration of the prognostic significance of PTH within a demographic comprising individuals with diabetes or prediabetes. Our approach differs from previous research on PTH and its association with poor prognosis, which often relied on studies that lacked crucial information regarding participants' lifestyle, comorbid conditions, serum calcium levels, serum phosphorus levels, vitamin D status, and PTH levels. In contrast, by employing the NHANES database, we are presented with a unique opportunity to effectively account for a range of confounding variables that were previously unaddressed. The primary limitations of our study are rooted in the cross-sectional design.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism: Review and recommendations on evaluation, diagnosis, and management. A Canadian and international consensus [^1135x1et]. Osteoporosis International (2017). High credibility.

In specific circumstances regarding vitamin D deficiency, particularly for patients with primary hyperparathyroidism, the CTFH 2017 guidelines recommend correcting vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency. This aims to lower serum PTH without further elevating serum calcium in these patients. It is advised to correct serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels to greater than 50 nmol/L.

### Vitamin D deficiency and primary hyperparathyroidism [^117NCNWB]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2007). Low credibility.

Temporally associated with the improvement in vitamin D nutrition in many Western countries in the mid-20th century, there was a change in many characteristics of primary hyperparathyroidism. Osteitis fibrosa cystica became a rare manifestation of what is now frequently an asymptomatic disease. At the same time, in patients with the disease, levels of PTH and parathyroid adenoma weights have fallen dramatically.

In view of these observations and others, an association between vitamin D deficiency and the severity of primary hyperparathyroidism has been proposed. Data support an association on two distinct levels. First, regardless of the clinical severity of primary hyperparathyroidism, the disease seems to be more severe in those with concomitant vitamin D deficiency. Second, vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency seem to be more prevalent in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism than in geographically matched populations.

The association between vitamin D deficiency and primary hyperparathyroidism has clear implications. Co-existing vitamin D deficiency may cause the serum calcium level to fall into the normal range, leading to diagnostic uncertainty. With regard to management, preliminary data on vitamin D repletion in patients with mild primary hyperparathyroidism suggest that, in some cases, correction of vitamin D deficiency may be accomplished without worsening the underlying hypercalcemia. Vitamin D-deficient patients undergoing parathyroidectomy are also at increased risk of postoperative hypocalcemia and "hungry bone syndrome", which underscores the importance of managing vitamin D levels accurately.

### Associations between change in total and free 25-hydroxyvitamin D with 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D and parathyroid hormone [^117JcNCy]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). High credibility.

The physiologic role of free 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] in humans is unclear. This study assesses whether a rise in total versus free 25(OH)D is associated with changes in downstream biomarkers of 25(OH)D entry into target cells in the kidney and parathyroid: 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [24,25(OH)2D] and parathyroid hormone (PTH), respectively.

This research involved a 16-week randomized controlled trial conducted at an academic medical center. The intervention included a daily dose of 60 μg (2400 IU) of D3 or 20 μg of 25(OH)D3. Participants were 35 adults aged 18 years or older with 25(OH)D levels below 20 ng/mL.

Main outcome measures were 24,25(OH)2D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25(OH)2D], and PTH. At baseline, the combined D3 and 25(OH)D3 groups had a mean age of 35.1 ± 10.6 years. The mean levels for total 25(OH)D, free 25(OH)D, 24,25(OH)2D, and PTH were 16.6 ng/mL, 4.6 pg/mL, 1.3 ng/mL, and 37.2 pg/mL, respectively. From 0 to 4 weeks, an increase in only free 25(OH)D was associated with a concurrent 24,25(OH)2D increase (P = 0.03, adjusted for change in 1,25(OH)2D and supplementation regimen) and a PTH decrease (P = 0.01, adjusted for change in calcium and supplementation regimen). Between 4 and 8 weeks, and again from 8 to 16 weeks, rises in both free and total 25(OH)D were associated with 24,25(OH)2D increase; however, increases in neither total nor free 25(OH)D were associated with PTH decrease during these time periods.

Conclusions suggest that an early rise in free 25(OH)D during the treatment of vitamin D deficiency is more strongly associated with changes in biomarkers of 25(OH)D entry into target kidney and parathyroid cells, indicating a physiologic role of free 25(OH)D in humans.

### Vitamin D supplementation after the menopause [^113dYKVu]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

There are several prevalent conditions in postmenopausal women associated with low serum 25(OH)D; hence, normalization of 25(OH)D levels may improve those conditions. Despite this, an excessive increase of 25(OH)D levels is not associated with better clinical results. In postmenopausal women, low vitamin D levels are associated with hypersecretion of PTH, and vitamin D supplementation reduces serum PTH and increases 25(OH)D levels. Increased PTH is associated with increased cortical bone porosity. Women who are not vitamin D deficient would not obtain benefit from vitamin D supplementation. However, elderly women who do not receive active bone-forming treatments and have osteoporosis and low serum vitamin D should receive vitamin D supplementation as an anti-fracture agent. Meta-analysis of RCTs indicates that vitamin D and calcium supplementation produce a significant reduction of fracture risk (any and hip).

Insufficient and deficient 25(OH)D levels are associated with an increased risk of MetS in postmenopausal women, and vitamin D supplementation significantly reduces triglyceride, insulin, and HOMA-IR values. BMI is a good predictor of low 25(OH)D status in women, and the vitamin D supplementation dose should be adjusted according to BMI. In addition, concomitant vitamin D and calcium supplementation may reduce central fat deposits. Obese women may need higher vitamin D supplementation doses to normalize their circulating levels. In women with prediabetes and low 25(OH)D levels, vitamin D supplementation may improve insulin sensitivity.

### Does higher serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels will harm bone mineral density? A cross-sectional study [^111SMwSw]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2024). Low credibility.

Our study demonstrated a clear association between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and total bone mineral density (BMD) among the adult US population. We also revealed a significant U-shaped relationship, indicating that the serum 25(OH)D concentration associated with the highest bone mineral density was 81.1 nmol/L. The optimal 25-hydroxyvitamin D level for adult males is 84.8 nmol/L. For adult females, it is crucial to set the threshold for vitamin D deficiency above 31.4 nmol/L, as lower 25(OH)D levels are not conducive to optimal BMD. Moreover, these findings provide clinicians and researchers with a critical reference point for designing and implementing targeted interventions to optimize bone health outcomes in this population. Our study advances the understanding of the interplay between vitamin D status and bone health, paving the way for more effective strategies to combat osteoporosis and related conditions.

### Vitamin D, secondary hyperparathyroidism, and preeclampsia [^113J527a]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2013). Low credibility.

Secondary hyperparathyroidism, defined by a high concentration of intact parathyroid hormone when circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] is low, serves as a functional indicator of vitamin D insufficiency and a sign of impaired calcium metabolism. Two large randomized controlled trials examined the effects of calcium supplementation on preeclampsia but did not consider the vitamin D status of mothers.

- **Objective**: We examined the association of secondary hyperparathyroidism with the risk of preeclampsia.

- **Design**: Circulating maternal 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] and intact parathyroid hormone were measured at entry to care (mean ± SD: 13.7 ± 5.7 weeks) using prospective data from a cohort of 1,141 low-income and minority gravidae.

- **Results**: Secondary hyperparathyroidism occurred in 6.3% of the cohort, and 18.4% of women whose 25(OH)D concentrations were 20 ng/mL were not at increased risk. Intact parathyroid hormone was related to higher systolic and diastolic blood pressures and arterial pressure at week 20 before clinical recognition of preeclampsia. Energy-adjusted intakes of total calcium and lactose and circulating 25(OH)D were inversely correlated with systolic blood pressure or arterial pressure and with parathyroid hormone.

- **Conclusion**: Some women who are vitamin D insufficient develop secondary hyperparathyroidism, which may be associated with increased blood pressure and the risk of preeclampsia.

### Randomized controlled trial of vitamin D supplementation in older people to optimize bone health [^114dqZii]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2019). Low credibility.

Vitamin D insufficiency is common in older people and may lead to increased bone resorption, bone loss, and increased falls and fractures. However, clinical trials assessing the effect of vitamin D supplementation on bone mineral density (BMD) have yielded conflicting results.

- **Objectives**: This study examined the effect of vitamin D supplementation on BMD at the hip, using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry.

- **Methods**: A total of 379 adults aged ≥ 70 years (48% women; mean age: 75 years) from the northeast of England were randomly allocated to one of three doses of vitamin D3 [12,000 international units (IU), 24,000 IU, or 48,000 IU] given once a month. The primary outcome was change in BMD (ΔBMD) at the hip. Secondary endpoints comprised the dose effects on femoral neck BMD, falls, circulating calciotropic hormones, bone turnover markers, and adverse events.

- **Results**: The mean ± SD baseline plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentration was 40.0 ± 20.1 nmol/L, which increased after 12 months to a mean 25(OH)D of 55.9, 64.6, or 79.0 nmol/L for participants receiving a monthly dose of 12,000, 24,000, or 48,000 IU, respectively (P < 0.01 for difference). There was no between-group difference in ΔBMD. However, parathyroid hormone concentrations decreased in all three groups, with a significantly greater decrease in the 48,000-IU group compared with the 12,000-IU group (P < 0.01). There were no differences in any adverse events between groups, with three cases of hypercalcemia, none of nephrolithiasis, and 249 falls observed.

- **Conclusions**: There was no difference in change in BMD over 12 months.

### Vitamin C deficiency and secondary hyperparathyroidism in chronic haemodialysis patients [^116FZCAB]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2008). Low credibility.

Maintenance haemodialysis patients often suffer from secondary hyperparathyroidism, and serum parathyroid hormone levels may be influenced by nutritional variables.

- **Methods**: We examined serum bio-intact parathyroid hormone (BiPTH) and plasma vitamin C in 117 chronic haemodialysis patients. Plasma vitamin C was measured by high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection on samples collected before the start of the dialysis treatment.

- **Results**: Plasma vitamin C showed a significant positively skewed distribution, ranging from 300 microM. We found 15% (n = 17) of the patients with severe vitamin C deficiency (80 microM), which is the upper limit of normal for the non-renal disease population. High plasma vitamin C was associated with lower plasma BiPTH (P = 0.005, one-way analysis of variance), and this association persisted after stepwise multiple regression for other factors known to influence PTH. Low vitamin C levels were also associated with increased serum alkaline phosphatase, a further indicator of the impact of vitamin C status on bone metabolism. Patients who reported dietary vitamin C intake of ≥ 100 mg/day had lower BiPTH (P = 0.015), consistent with findings from plasma measurements of vitamin C. This novel observation of the interaction between PTH and vitamin C may result from the effects of vitamin C on cAMP-linked signalling pathways in the bone and parathyroid gland.

- **Conclusions**: This finding does not yet warrant therapeutic intervention with vitamin C supplements.

### Thyroid hormone and parathyroid hormone competing to maintain calcium levels in the presence of vitamin D deficiency [^112y4k9e]. Thyroid (2004). Low credibility.

Weight loss and bone disease in the elderly are very often attributed to malignancy. Rarely, benign treatable conditions may be overlooked. Thyrotoxicosis, a benign treatable condition, needs to be excluded in such patients. The diagnosis may be delayed since the symptoms are often subtle, and secondary complications, including bone disease (osteoporosis), are therefore more frequent at the time of presentation. This case illustrates this well and also highlights the value of measuring vitamin D levels in such patients. The most interesting aspect of this case was the reciprocal relationship between thyroxine and parathyroid hormone observed in maintaining calcium homeostasis in this thyrotoxic patient with low vitamin D levels.

### Natpara (parathyroid hormone) [^116kCnCk]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

At randomization, active forms of vitamin D were reduced by 50%, and patients were randomized to receive either Natpara 50 mcg daily or a placebo. Randomization was followed by a 12-week Natpara titration phase and a 12-week Natpara dose maintenance phase. During the titration phase, Natpara was increased by 25 mcg increments every four weeks up to a maximum of 100 mcg. Titration was indicated for patients who could not achieve independence from active vitamin D and could not reduce oral calcium to 500 mg or less per day. At the end of treatment, 56% of subjects randomized to Natpara were receiving 100 mcg of Natpara per day, 26% were receiving 75 mcg of Natpara per day, and 18% were receiving 50 mcg of Natpara per day. Doses of co-administered active forms of vitamin D and calcium were adjusted (reduced or increased) to maintain albumin-corrected serum calcium within a desired target range throughout the trial in both arms.

For the efficacy analysis, subjects who fulfilled three components of a three-part response criterion were considered responders. A responder was defined as an individual who had at least a 50% reduction from baseline in the dose of active vitamin D, at least a 50% reduction from baseline in the dose of oral calcium supplementation, and an albumin-corrected total serum calcium concentration between 7.5 mg/dL and 10.6 mg/dL.

At the end of treatment, significantly more subjects treated with Natpara [46/84 (54.8%)] compared to placebo [1/40 (2.5%)] met the response criterion (p-value < 0.001). Forty-two percent (35/84) of subjects randomized to Natpara were independent of active vitamin D and oral calcium supplementation.

### A prospective observational study of all-cause mortality in relation to serum 25-OH vitamin D3 and parathyroid hormone levels in patients with type 2 diabetes [^1119CAF7]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2015). Low credibility.

Vitamin D is stored in adipose tissue and liver in an inactive form, and serum levels of vitamin D are negatively related to adiposity. Prospective observational studies have shown inverse associations between serum vitamin D and the future risk of hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, and incident diabetes. Furthermore, low levels of serum vitamin D (25-hydroxyvitamin D3) have been linked with an increased risk of mortality in different non-diabetic populations. In experimental studies, vitamin D has been shown to reduce activity in the renin-angiotensin system, and inflammation has also been inhibited by the action of vitamin D, suggesting causality between low levels of this vitamin and an increased prevalence of cardiovascular disease.

However, arguing against a simple inverse relationship between levels of vitamin D and risk for disease was the recent finding of increased mortality rates in two large studies among subjects with particularly high levels of vitamin D. Deficiency of vitamin D leads to increased levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH), which allows the release of calcium stored in bone tissue. High levels of PTH have been linked with increased arterial calcification in a population-based study in Sweden, and it is well-known that secondary hyperparathyroidism is an indicator of poor outcomes in renal diseases in which activation of vitamin D is deficient.

New and clinically useful markers of risk are essential in high-risk states such as type 2 diabetes. Recently, it was shown that patients with type 2 diabetes and low vitamin D levels had an increased risk of adverse outcomes.

### Relationship between vitamin D, calcium and parathyroid hormone in Cape Town [^116xm7rw]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2009). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that vitamin D deficiency is associated with abnormal levels of calcium and parathyroid hormone (PTH).

- **Methods**: Vitamin D requests at a tertiary hospital in South Africa over two years were retrospectively analyzed along with calcium and PTH levels.

- **Results**: Only when the 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) level dropped below 25 nmol/l, was there a significant rise in PTH. A subnormal 25(OH)D level was also not always related to hypocalcemia, as more than half of the patients with their 25(OH)D level below 25 nmol/l had calcium levels in the reference range. However, all patients with calcium levels below 1.8 mmol/l were shown to have vitamin D insufficiency.

- **Conclusion**: Hypovitaminosis D may co-exist with a blunted PTH response. Therefore, assumptions about vitamin D status should not be made based on PTH and calcium values. 25(OH)D measurements should be requested when vitamin D deficiency is clinically suspected, irrespective of biochemical results.

### Effects of high-dose vitamin D2 versus D3 on total and free 25-hydroxyvitamin D and markers of calcium balance [^116J3h4r]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

Controversy persists over: 1) how best to restore low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25D) levels (vitamin D2 [D2] vs. vitamin D3 [D3]); 2) how best to define vitamin D status (total [protein-bound + free] vs. free 25D); and 3) how best to assess the bioactivity of free 25D.

- **Objective**: To assess 1) the effects of D2 vs. D3 on serum total and free 25D, and 2) whether change in intact PTH (iPTH) is more strongly associated with change in total vs. free 25D.

- **Design**: Participants previously enrolled in a D2 vs. D3 trial were matched for age, body mass index, and race/ethnicity. Participants received 50,000 IU of D2 or D3 twice weekly for 5 weeks, followed by a 5-week equilibration period. Biochemical assessment was performed at baseline and at 10 weeks.

- **Setting and participants**: Thirty-eight adults (19 D2 and 19 D3) ≥ 18 years of age with baseline 25D levels < 30 ng/mL were recruited from an academic ambulatory osteoporosis clinic.

- **Outcome measures**: Serum measures were total 25D, free 25D (directly measured), 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, calcium, and iPTH. The urine measure was fasting calcium:creatinine ratio.

- **Results**: Baseline total (22.2 ± 3.3 vs. 23.3 ± 7.2 ng/mL; p = 0.5) and free (5.4 ± 0.8 vs. 5.3 ± 1.7 pg/mL; p = 0.8) 25D levels were similar between D2 and D3 groups. Increases in total (+27.6 vs. +12.2 ng/mL; p = 0.001) and free (+3.6 vs. +6.2 pg/mL; p = 0.02) 25D levels were greater with D3 vs. D2. Percentage change in iPTH was significantly associated with change in free (but not total) 25D, without and with adjustment for supplementation regimen and change in 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D.

### Relationship between serum parathyroid hormone levels, vitamin D sufficiency, and calcium intake [^113BKRso]. JAMA (2005). Low credibility.

Adequate vitamin D status for optimum bone health has received increased recognition in recent years; however, the ideal intake is not known. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D is the generally accepted indicator of vitamin D status, but no universal reference level has been reached.

- **Objective**: To investigate the relative importance of high calcium intake and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D for calcium homeostasis, as determined by serum intact parathyroid hormone (PTH).

- **Design, setting, and participants**: Cross-sectional study of 2310 healthy Icelandic adults who were divided equally into 3 age groups (30–45 years, 50–65 years, or 70–85 years) and recruited from February 2001 to January 2003. They were administered a semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire, which assessed vitamin D and calcium intake. Participants were further divided into groups according to calcium intake (1200 mg/d) and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level (18 ng/mL).

- **Main outcome measure**: Serum intact PTH as determined by calcium intake and vitamin D.

- **Results**: A total of 944 healthy participants completed all parts of the study. After adjusting for relevant factors, serum PTH was lowest in the group with a serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level of more than 18 ng/mL but highest in the group with a serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level of less than 10 ng/mL. At the low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level (< 10 ng/mL), calcium intake of less than 800 mg/d vs more than 1200 mg/d was significantly associated with higher serum PTH (P = 0.04).

### Normocalcaemic, vitamin D-sufficient hyperparathyroidism - high prevalence and low morbidity in the general population: A long-term follow-up study, the who MONICA project, Gothenburg, Sweden [^113QuJQK]. Clinical Endocrinology (2015). Low credibility.

The prevalence of hypertension, determined by the use of antihypertensives, was higher, but S-25(OH)D was lower in normocalcaemic hyperparathyroidism (nHPT) than in subjects with normal serum parathyroid hormone (S-PTH). There were no differences between groups regarding:

- **Metabolic markers**: Blood glucose, lipids, thyroid hormones, S‐anti‐TPO, vitamin B12, folic acid, phosphate, iron, creatinine, cystatin C, glucose, insulin
- **Anthropometrics**: Body height, weight, change in height or body weight
- **Bone health**: Calcaneal quantitative ultrasound (QUS) over 13 years

The subjects with nHPT had dietary differences compared to those with normal S-PTH, including:

- **Higher intake**: Fat cheese (P = 0.0028), cream (P = 0.0114)
- **Lower intake**: Fatty fish (P = 0.0358), vitamin D fortified low-fat milk (P = 0.0154)

The calcium intake per day was above the recommended daily intake of 1000 mg/day in both groups. There were no significant differences in calcium or vitamin D supplementation (mainly 1000 mg calcium and 800 IU cholecalciferol) or thiazide use between the two groups. Physical activity at work or during leisure time did not differ between groups.

Data from 1995 for the two groups compared in Table 1 showed a higher prevalence of hypertension and higher S-PTH and S-Osteocalcin levels in nHPT than in those with normal S-PTH in 2008. Notably, the S-Ca and S-25(OH)D levels in 1995 did not differ between groups. The S-Ca levels in 2008 were evenly distributed within the normocalcaemic range in relation to S-PTH.

### Rapid analysis of 25-hydroxyvitamin D(2) and D(3) by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and association of vitamin D and parathyroid hormone concentrations in healthy adults [^113gveYq]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2010). Low credibility.

The measurement of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OH-vitD) is used to assess vitamin D status. We developed a high-sensitivity measurement method for 25OH-vitD and assessed the relationship between 25OH-vitD and parathyroid hormone (PTH) in healthy adults. Aliquots (100 μL) of serum were spiked with an internal standard, proteins were precipitated, and samples were analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry using 2-dimensional chromatographic separation. Total imprecision was less than 10%, and the limit of quantitation was 1.0 ng/mL. We determined the distribution of concentrations of 25OH-vitD(2) and 25OH-vitD(3) in healthy adults using samples collected during winter and summer and evaluated the association between 25OH-vitD and PTH. The difference between median concentrations of 25OH-vitD in samples collected during winter and summer was 11 ng/mL (27 nmol/L). Statistically significant differences in concentrations of PTH were observed between groups of samples with 25OH-vitD less than 11 ng/mL (27 nmol/L) and 11 to 15 ng/mL (27–37 nmol/L) and between groups with 25 to 30 ng/mL (62–75 nmol/L) and more than 40 ng/mL (100 nmol/L). Among the advantages of this method are its high sensitivity and specificity.

In specific circumstances concerning vitamin D deficiency, particularly in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism (postoperative), the AAES 2016 guidelines recommend initiating vitamin D supplementation in patients with vitamin D deficiency after an apparently successful parathyroidectomy. It is also advised to follow the recommended calcium intake as outlined by the IOM Dietary Reference Intakes.

### Calcitriol [^1165jeuf]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Warnings

Since calcitriol is the most potent metabolite of vitamin D available, prescription-based doses of vitamin D and its derivatives should be withheld or used with caution during treatment to avoid the risk of hypercalcemia.

A non-aluminum phosphate-binding compound should be used to control serum phosphorous levels in patients undergoing dialysis.

Overdosage of any form of vitamin D is dangerous (see also overdosage). Progressive hypercalcemia due to overdosage of vitamin D and its metabolites may be so severe as to require emergency attention. Chronic hypercalcemia can lead to generalized vascular calcification, nephrocalcinosis, and other soft tissue calcification. The serum calcium times phosphate (Ca × P) product should not be allowed to exceed 70 mg²/dL². Radiographic evaluation of suspect anatomical regions may be useful in the early detection of this condition.

### Inhibition of parathyroid hormone secretion by caffeine in human parathyroid cells [^114WTNFT]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2013). High credibility.

Caffeine is a highly consumed psychoactive substance present in our daily drinks. Independent studies have reported associations between caffeine consumption, low bone mineral density, and urinary calcium loss, as well as impaired bone development both in vitro and in vivo. Calcium (Ca 2+), vitamin D, and parathyroid hormone (PTH) are critical regulators of bone remodeling. A possible association between caffeine and parathyroid gland function has been suggested in the literature.

- **Design, setting, and patients**: Effects of caffeine on PTH secretion and Ca 2+ levels were determined by batch incubation and Fura-2, respectively, in pathological parathyroid cells. Protein expressions were studied by Western blot and immunohistochemistry in normal and parathyroid adenoma tissues. Alterations in gene expressions of adenosine receptor A1 (ADORA1) and A2 (ADORA2A), and PTH were quantified by PCR. Intracellular cAMP levels and protein kinase A activity were analyzed by an antibody-based assay.

- **Results**: We studied physiological concentrations of caffeine ranging from 1 to 50 μm. We found that 50 μm of caffeine caused a significant decrease in PTH secretion and PTH gene expression. This decrease occurred in parallel with a decrease in the intracellular cAMP level, protein kinase A activity, and ADORA1 gene expression, indicating a possible causal relationship. The intracellular level of Ca 2+ was unaffected even by high concentrations of caffeine. Protein expressions demonstrated two main targets for caffeine — ADORA1 and ADORA2A.

### Paradoxical response of parathyroid hormone to vitamin D-calcium supplementation in Indian children [^111F3J9h]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2020). High credibility.

The objective of the study was to investigate the effect of oral vitamin D-calcium supplementation on serum intact parathyroid hormone (PTH), calcium, phosphorous, and alkaline phosphatase (ALK-P) concentrations in children with habitually low calcium intakes.

In this follow-up study to a randomized controlled trial that aimed to assess the effect of vitamin D-calcium supplementation on immunity, data related to dietary intake, anthropometry, and biochemistry (serum 25(OH)D and bone profile) were collected from 178 children, with 79 in the vitamin D group and 99 in the non-vitamin D group.

Results indicated that the dietary calcium to phosphorus intake ratio was 0.4:1. Baseline serum 25(OH)D concentration was 58.2 ± 10.9 nmol/L; 66% of children were vitamin D sufficient and none were deficient. After supplementation, the vitamin D group compared to the non-vitamin D group had significantly greater 25(OH)D levels (83.9 ± 30.1 nmol/L vs 58.3 ± 15.7 nmol/L), significantly greater PTH levels (6.7 ± 3.6 pmol/L vs 5.5 ± 3.2 pmol/L), and a positive correlation (rₛ = 0.24) between serum 25(OH)D and PTH, contrasted with a negative correlation (rₛ = −0.1) in the non-vitamin D group. Mean concentrations of serum bone measures in the vitamin D group were calcium (2.2 ± 0.1 mmol/L), phosphorus (1.7 ± 0.2 mmol/L), and ALK-P (178.7 ± 40.7 IU/L). At follow-up, one year post-supplementation, in the vitamin D group, PTH concentrations continued to remain high (though not significantly different from levels at six months), with low normal serum calcium, high normal phosphate, and ALK-P in the reference range.

In conclusion, in children who are vitamin D sufficient, the response of parathyroid hormone to vitamin D-calcium supplementation appears paradoxical, maintaining elevated levels despite increased vitamin D status.

### Vitamin D deficiency is not good for you [^1121TDLd]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

The choice of measuring vitamin D levels using the gold standard method of liquid chromatography followed by tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS-MS) is a second asset of the present work. Although levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] are high enough to allow detection by immunoassay techniques, avoiding the use of antibodies results in much more reliable measurements with LC/MS-MS. Furthermore, novel data indicate that modified forms of 25(OH)D may be circulating that are falsely overdetected or not detected by the antibodies and may have physiological implications. Still, at present, only a few laboratories around the world are able to measure 25(OH)D by LC/MS-MS, and most laboratories therefore continue to use kits. Their continued widespread use might lead to an overestimation of both the frequency and magnitude of vitamin D deficiency.

This brings us to the other crucial question of where to put the cutoff that defines vitamin D deficiency, even with LC/MS-MS. We do not know, and we do not have a consensus. In addition, there is ongoing debate concerning the dosage of nutritional and vitamin D supplements required to achieve vitamin D sufficiency. The turmoil around a statement released by the Institute of Medicine (IOM) is just an illustration of the problem. For bone health, defining the level of vitamin D deficiency is relatively easy as the rise in parathyroid hormone levels can be used as a marker for vitamin D levels that are too low. When 25(OH)D levels drop below 10–20 ng/mL (25–50 nmol/L), parathyroid hormone levels rise, indicating the switching on of the feedback mechanism to counteract vitamin D deficiency.

### Parathyroid hormone, vitamin D levels and urine albumin excretion in older persons: the 2011 Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES) [^11496U2D]. Clinical endocrinology (2014). Low credibility.

Persistent elevation of urinary albumin excretion (UAE), even within the normal range, is an independent predictor for cardiovascular disease. Accumulating research suggests that low levels of vitamin D and high levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH) also increase cardiovascular disease risk. This study is intended to investigate the relationship between PTH, vitamin D levels, and UAE.

- **Methods**: We examined 2,897 adults aged 50 and above, participating in the second year of the fifth Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES V-2). Anthropometric and laboratory measurements were performed. Elevated UAE was defined as a spot urinary albumin-creatinine ratio equal to or above 10.

- **Results**: The proportion of elevated UAE (21.8%, 23.2%, 23.2%, 31.8%; P for trend = 0.002) rose with increasing quartiles of PTH. The odds ratio for elevated UAE in the highest quartile of PTH was 72% higher than the lowest quartile group. There was no relationship between vitamin D and elevated UAE.

- **Conclusions**: Elevated PTH levels are associated with elevated UAE in Korean adults aged 50 and above. Additional studies are needed to clarify this relationship.

### Effects of cholecalciferol vs calcifediol on total and free 25-hydroxyvitamin D and parathyroid hormone [^112diNkt]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2017). Low credibility.

Vitamin D deficiency disproportionately affects nonwhite individuals. Controversy persists over how to best restore low 25D levels and how to best define vitamin D status, focusing on total (protein-bound plus free) vs. free 25D.

- **Objective**: To assess the effects of vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol, or D3) vs. 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (calcifediol, or 25D3) on total and free 25D in a multiethnic cohort of adults, and whether change in parathyroid hormone (PTH) is more strongly associated with total vs. free 25D.

- **Design**: Sixteen-week randomized controlled trial. Biochemistries at 0, 4, 8, and 16 weeks.

- **Setting**: Academic medical center.

- **Participants**: Thirty-five adults ≥ 18 years of age with 25D levels < 20 ng/mL.

- **Intervention**: Sixty micrograms (2400 IU) per day of D3 or 20 μg per day of 25D3.

- **Main outcome measures**: Total and free 25D, and PTH.

- **Results**: Baseline total (16.2 ± 3.7 vs. 17.0 ± 2.5 ng/mL; P = 0.4) and free (4.2 ± 0.8 vs. 4.7 ± 1.0 pg/mL; P = 0.2) 25D were similar between D3 and 25D3 groups, respectively; 25D3 increased total (+25.5 vs. +13.8 ng/mL; P = 0.001) and free (+6.6 vs. +3.5 pg/mL; P = 0.03) 25D more than D3. By 4 weeks, 87.5% of 25D3 participants had total 25D levels ≥ 30 ng/mL, compared with 23.1% of D3 participants (P = 0.001). Change in PTH was associated with both total (P = 0.01) and free 25D (P = 0.04).

- **Conclusions**: 25D3 increased total and free 25D levels more rapidly than D3, regardless of race/ethnicity. Free and total 25D were similarly associated with change in PTH.

### Acetate free citrate-containing dialysate increase intact-PTH and BAP levels in the patients with low intact-PTH [^111hJRf3]. BMC Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

Metabolic acidosis and bone metabolism

The bone diseases that accompany CKD are due to alterations in PTH and vitamin D levels. However, substantial data has implicated chronic metabolic acidosis as an additional important factor. In our cross-over study, although there was no significant difference in int-PTH or BAP during the A(−)D and A(+)D periods in patients with normal or high PTH levels, we found a significant increase in int-PTH and BAP levels during the A(−)D period exclusively in patients with low PTH levels. This result aligns with a previous study performed on 21 MHD patients with metabolic acidosis (serum HCO₃⁻ levels: 15–16.8 mmol/L). The amelioration of metabolic acidosis by raising the dialysate base HCO₃⁻ concentration was found to increase PTH, reduce bone resorption in patients with low PTH levels, and improve bone formation in patients with high PTH levels.

Furthermore, Krieger et al. reported a direct suppressive effect of metabolic acidosis on osteoblastic-induced collagen synthesis in an in vitro study, which decreased by 15% after exposure to an acidic milieu. We are uncertain of the exact mechanism, but in our cross-over study, PTH and BAP levels increased exclusively in patients with low-PTH levels. From these reports and our results, it appears that optimal correction of metabolic acidosis might affect int-PTH and BAP levels in patients with low PTH levels. On the other hand, there was no significant difference in int-PTH or BAP levels during either the A(−)D period or other periods in patients with higher PTH levels.

### High doses of cholecalciferol alleviate the progression of hyperparathyroidism in patients with CKD stages 3–4: results of a 12-week double-blind, randomized, controlled study [^115rqo8W]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2018). Low credibility.

A subgroup analysis was performed to investigate the effect of CKD stage on outcomes. In the CKD Stage 3 subgroup, PTH levels did not change in either treatment group. In the cholecalciferol group, PTH was 8.6 ± 2.0 pmol/L at baseline and 9.1 ± 3.9 pmol/L after 12 weeks. The placebo group had corresponding values of 8.8 ± 3.0 at baseline and 8.7 ± 3.3 after 12 weeks. There were no differences in mean change between groups (P = 0.95).

In CKD Stage 4, the mean PTH changed from 12.5 ± 6.6 to 11.5 ± 5.8 pmol/L in the treatment group, and from 16.4 ± 11.0 to 19.1 ± 12.4 pmol/L in the placebo group. The mean (confidence interval) difference in change between groups was −3.8 (−6.5; −1.1) (P = 0.006).

Among the subjects, 50% had a baseline 25(OH)D of 57 nmol/L. The result was −1.5 (−3.2; 0.2) (P = 0.09). When further analyzed, a correlation between 25(OH)D level and iPTH in the treatment group was found, indicating that even when vitamin D is sufficient, it is possible to suppress iPTH with native vitamin D. The linear correlation can be expressed as [iPTH (pmol/L) = 17.05 − 0.0407 × [25(OH)D (nmol/L)]. This theoretically implies that a mean iPTH of 12 pmol/L corresponds to 25(OH)D of 120 nmol/L, and a 'normal' level < 6.9 pmol/L correlates with 25(OH)D of ∼250 nmol/L.

### Consensus statement on vitamin D status assessment and supplementation: Whys, whens, and hows [^111ByWWk]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). Low credibility.

Theoretically, obtaining a 25(OH)D level within an optimal window for the general population will necessarily result in overscreening and overtreatment of healthy individuals. While general screening for 25(OH)D deficiency/insufficiency is not recommended, measurements could be performed in patients with several risk factors for severe deficiency or who are being evaluated for metabolic bone disease. This recommendation may help to mitigate the dramatic increase in the number of 25(OH)D measurements and the associated economic burden. Supporting this view, initiatives have been undertaken to reduce unnecessary 25(OH)D analyses in Australia. The change in recommended testing criteria halved the number of measurements but paradoxically increased the number of unnecessary tests and decreased tests of patients at high risk of deficiency, with only a small improvement in the detection of deficiency.

- **Screening and testing for vitamin D status**: Levels of 25(OH)D in the general population vary considerably depending on several factors, including the season, latitude, cultural factors leading to reduced UVB light exposure, skin pigmentation, body mass index (BMI), sex, age, level of physical exercise, and food fortification with vitamin D or use of vitamin D supplements. Even among otherwise comparable Western societies, genetic factors such as gene polymorphisms may have major effects on serum 25(OH)D according to twin studies and mendelian randomization (MR) reports.

### A prospective observational study of all-cause mortality in relation to serum 25-OH vitamin D3 and parathyroid hormone levels in patients with type 2 diabetes [^114fwc3g]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2015). Low credibility.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest study to demonstrate a relationship between vitamin D levels and mortality in men with type 2 diabetes. Strengths of our study include registry data on mortality, with no patients lost to follow-up. It is the first study of its kind that includes measures of parathyroid hormone (PTH) and corrected calcium in conjunction with vitamin D. We were also able to analyze data with respect to novel markers of atherosclerosis and vascular disease, such as pulse wave velocity (PWV) and carotid intima-media thickness (IMT).

Weaknesses include a rather short follow-up period and consequently low rates of mortality. However, the short follow-up period suggests clinical relevance insofar as patients were indeed being cared for in a manner that is in accordance with guidelines. This was confirmed by frequent treatment with statins and antihypertensive medication, while mean levels of HbA1c and ambulatory blood pressures were generally acceptable. Additionally, we were not able to analyze data with regard to significant renal failure, a condition that affects vitamin D metabolism, since no patients had an estimated glomerular filtration rate < 30 ml/min/1.73 m². We also acknowledge that data on estrogen replacement therapy was lacking. However, we assumed that patients were treated according to guidelines in this respect and that post-menopausal estrogen replacement therapy was only used for very short periods of time (months) in selected patients.

Although statin treatment has been associated with an increase in vitamin D levels, we found no such interactions between the use of statins and high vitamin D levels.

### Hyperphosphatemia is associated with anemia in adults without chronic kidney disease: Results from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES): 2005–2010 [^113Tv6EU]. BMC Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

Low vitamin D levels decrease gut phosphorus absorption, as vitamin D acts on intestinal epithelial cells to increase the intestinal absorption of calcium and phosphorus, which may be associated with hyperphosphatemia. Low levels of vitamin D and parathyroid hormone increase the transport of phosphorus out of the renal cells through the 3NA-HPO4 co-transporter type 2a (NPT-2a) and limit renal tubular reabsorption, resulting in hyperphosphatemia. However, under normal phosphate intake conditions, as observed with the NHANES population, vitamin D does not stimulate jejunal phosphorus absorption. It is only in patients with chronic kidney disease or low levels of vitamin D that vitamin D administration can increase phosphorus absorption. Due to the complex relationship between these factors and phosphorus absorption, we adjusted for vitamin D levels in addition to parathyroid hormone in a smaller model examining risk factors for hyperphosphatemia and hypophosphatemia.

In this adjusted model for hyperphosphatemia, the association with low hemoglobin was no longer statistically significant. It is possible that the smaller model, which was only one-third the size of the larger model, was not sufficiently powered. When assessing the association between low hemoglobin and hyperphosphatemia by stratifying on vitamin D levels greater than 30 ng/ml versus levels less than or equal to 30 ng/ml, the odds ratios were not significantly different between models (OR 1.10 versus OR 1.29) or in comparison with the adjusted model (OR 1.33), indicating that neither condition coexisted significantly with other factors examined.

### Discrepant influence of vitamin D status on parathyroid hormone and bone mass after two years of calcium supplementation [^112wtU2S]. Clinical Endocrinology (2010). Low credibility.

To investigate the influence of vitamin D status on parathyroid hormone and bone mass following a 2-year supplementation of calcium alone, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted with healthy postmenopausal women without osteoporosis. Three hundred and thirty-six subjects aged 60–97 years were studied and randomized to receive elemental calcium 500 mg/day (n = 175) or placebo (n = 161) for 2 years.

- **Patients and methods**: Changes in parathyroid hormone (PTH) and bone mineral density (BMD) from baseline and vitamin D status were measured. Values are presented as means ± SD.

- **Results**: After 2 years, subjects with calcium supplementation had a significant decrease in plasma PTH levels (4.4 ± 1.7 vs 4.7 ± 1.9 pmol/l, P < 0.01), improved lumbar BMD (1.031 ± 0.12 vs 1.004 ± 0.12 g/cm², P < 0.001), and total hip BMD (0.890 ± 0.10 vs 0.883 ± 0.10 g/cm², P < 0.001) without a change in femoral neck BMD. In the placebo group, PTH levels significantly increased (4.5 ± 1.5 vs 4.8 ± 1.6 pmol/l, P < 0.001), lumbar BMD slightly increased (1.027 ± 0.14 vs 1.018 ± 0.14 g/cm², P < 0.001), while total hip and femoral neck BMD decreased (0.876 ± 0.11 vs 0.887 ± 0.11 g/cm², P < 0.001 and 0.783 ± 0.10 vs 0.798 ± 0.10 g/cm², P < 0.001, respectively). Subjects were classified according to baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels into those with 25(OH)D in the lower tertile (lowVitD) and those in the middle and upper tertiles combined (normVitD). The degree of PTH suppression after calcium supplementation was significantly higher in the…

### A prospective observational study of all-cause mortality in relation to serum 25-OH vitamin D3 and parathyroid hormone levels in patients with type 2 diabetes [^114oMf8b]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2015). Low credibility.

In contrast to earlier reports on the relationships between vitamin D and mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes, our analysis also incorporated data on corrected calcium and serum PTH levels. It is important to have knowledge about PTH and calcium levels in conjunction with vitamin D to properly determine the presence of primary or secondary hyperparathyroidism. This is crucial since high PTH levels have been identified as a risk indicator in renal disease and the general non-diabetic population.

Our new analyses confirmed an independent relationship between low vitamin D levels and all-cause mortality in men with diabetes. This relationship remained statistically significant even when two other well-established risk markers for mortality, PWV and carotid IMT, were added to the analyses. This suggests that vitamin D can be used as a surrogate marker of risk for mortality in male patients with type 2 diabetes. However, it does not prove that vitamin D substitution reduces the risk in the studied cohort.

Results from experimental studies have suggested a causal relationship between treatment with vitamin D and the reduction of inflammatory activity and inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system. Despite this, we found no relationships between levels of vitamin D and CRP. However, vitamin D levels did show an inverse relationship with systolic ABP levels, which aligns with a lack of suppression of the renin-angiotensin system by vitamin D.

Recent studies on the effects of vitamin D treatment in non-diabetic patients on blood pressure and vascular function have shown…

### The effect of cigarette smoke exposure on vitamin D level and biochemical parameters of mothers and neonates [^111cENvv]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

In the results of some other studies, reduced serum levels of vitamin D were associated with decreased parathyroid hormone levels and a subsequent increase in serum phosphorus. Nicotine receptors in the parathyroid glands, which inhibited the gland, were stated as a probable mechanism. These findings are in contrast to the findings of the present study. These controversies could be due to vitamin D deficiency in pregnant women in the present study and low vitamin D levels in their diets. This deficiency was higher in the exposed group. Several studies have reported severe vitamin D deficiency in the general population and pregnant women in Iran.

There are numerous confounding factors that affect vitamin D reduction. In our study, vitamin D deficiency was seen in both groups so the effect of smoke on vitamin D levels could not be evaluated.

Neonatal vitamin D status is highly related to the amount of transfused vitamin D through the placenta and its levels at birth. Maternal vitamin D deficiency causes vitamin D deficiency in infants. The findings of the present study also confirm this relationship; serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D in mothers and infants had a significant correlation within both exposed and non-exposed groups. According to the findings, no significant difference was found in 25-hydroxyvitamin D, calcium, parathyroid hormone, phosphorus, and serum alkaline phosphatase levels of the umbilical cord between the two groups. Gomez and colleagues reported a significant difference in serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D, parathyroid hormone, and phosphorus levels of the umbilical cord.

### Seasonal variability in vitamin D levels no longer detectable in primary hyperparathyroidism [^113eHqQo]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Low credibility.

Seasonal variability in 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] and PTH levels in the general population has been associated with differences in bone turnover markers, bone density, and fracture risk. Seasonal variability in 25(OH)D and PTH levels has also been reported in primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT).

Given the widespread use of vitamin D supplements, we sought to determine whether patients with PHPT still demonstrated seasonal variation in 25(OH)D levels. This cross-sectional study was conducted at a university medical center at a Northeastern U.S. latitude (New York, NY), involving one hundred patients with PHPT.

- **Outcome measures**: We assessed vitamin D supplement use and seasonal variation in serum 25(OH)D. Patients had PHPT ([mean ± SD] calcium, 10.8 ± 1.0 mg/dL; PTH, 85 ± 48 pg/mL) with a mean 25(OH)D level of 29 ± 10 ng/mL. Although only one fifth of participants had vitamin D deficiency (19% < 20 ng/mL), more than half were either deficient or insufficient (54% < 30 ng/mL). Sun exposure varied by season, but there were no seasonal differences in levels of 25(OH)D, PTH, bone markers, or bone mineral density, or in the prevalence of 25(OH)D less than 20 or less than 30 ng/mL.

- **Vitamin D supplement use**: Most of the participants (65%) took supplemental vitamin D (dose among users: mean, 1643 ± 1496 IU; median, 1000 IU daily), and supplement users had markedly better vitamin D status than nonusers (25(OH)D < 20 ng/mL: 8 vs. 40%; P < .0001; < 30 ng/mL: 40 vs. 80%; p = 0.0001; ≥ 30 ng/mL: 60 vs. 20%; p = 0.0001).

In conclusion, this study suggests that the use of vitamin D supplements may mitigate seasonal variability in vitamin D levels among patients with PHPT.

### Vitamin D deficiency, bone turnover markers and causative factors among adolescents: a cross-sectional study [^111WoZJo]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

Natural dietary sources of 25 (OH) vitamin D are very limited, and foods fortified with 25 (OH) vitamin D often fail to meet the requirements of either children or adults.

Adolescence is a critical age for skeletal growth and achieving optimal peak bone mass. Adequate intake of calcium and 25 (OH) vitamin D from daily diets, in addition to maintaining normal serum levels of calcium and 25 (OH) vitamin D, positively affects bone health in adolescents. For instance, milk consumption has been positively correlated with bone mineral density of the total body, spine, and radius in adolescent girls.

Considering these facts, increasing vitamin D fortification of dairy products is recommended as a population-wide public health strategy to combat 25 (OH) vitamin D deficiency, especially in adolescents.

Our study demonstrated a significant positive correlation between serum 25 (OH) vitamin D levels and markers such as osteocalcin, crosslaps, and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase. Assessments of bone markers and their associations are rare in other recent studies.

In adults, an increase in serum 25 (OH) vitamin D suppresses serum PTH, while a decrease in serum 25 (OH) vitamin D increases serum PTH concentrations. However, the effects of PTH changes in children and adolescents remain unclear, although our study found a significant negative correlation between serum 25 (OH) vitamin D and PTH in adolescents.

One factor that could have confounded our results was not excluding students with a history of using supplements or consuming any unrelated substances.
