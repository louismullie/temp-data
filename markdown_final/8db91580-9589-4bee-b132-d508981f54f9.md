## Question

What diameter would colon rupture if distended?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the diameter at which the colon is likely to rupture if it becomes distended. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about which colonic segment is most at risk and why. Then, I should verify the best-supported diameter thresholds for impending perforation in acute colonic pseudo-obstruction. Next, I will examine how duration of distention modifies risk. After that, I need to check whether different etiologies (mechanical obstruction, toxic megacolon, volvulus) shift the threshold. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, clinically grounded answer with caveats and management implications.

> Let me first confirm the highest-risk segment. The cecum is the most vulnerable to rupture during colonic distension because it has the largest baseline diameter, the thinnest wall, and the highest transmural pressure according to Laplace's law, so it bears the greatest wall tension as intraluminal pressure rises. This is consistently emphasized in ACPO and barotrauma literature and aligns with surgical experience in large-bowel obstruction and volvulus contexts [^112Mk2Yj] [^112QRvHt].

> Now, I should verify the best-supported diameter threshold. Multiple high-credibility sources converge on a cecal diameter greater than 12 cm as a critical inflection point for increased risk of ischemia and perforation in ACPO, with the risk rising further beyond 14 cm. This is reflected in ASGE guidance, ASCRS guidelines, and contemporary reviews, and it is the most consistently cited actionable threshold in clinical practice [^117DBy7t] [^113F9kNr] [^114uHUtd].

> Wait, let me verify whether lower thresholds have also been used. Some series and case reports have flagged 9–10 cm as concerning, and a small retrospective analysis of obstructing distal colon cancer suggested that a cecal diameter greater than 9 cm correlated with impending perforation. However, these lower cutoffs are less generalizable and often reflect specific populations or study design, so I should not overstate them as universal thresholds despite their heuristic value in select contexts [^113EfJ9X] [^112v6PH1].

> I need to ensure I account for time as a risk amplifier. Duration of distention beyond roughly 4–6 days substantially increases perforation risk even at similar diameters, and several guidelines advise escalation to pharmacologic or endoscopic decompression if ACPO persists beyond 48–72 hours or if the cecum exceeds 12 cm, precisely to preempt ischemia and perforation. This time-diameter interplay is a key reason serial imaging is recommended in ACPO [^117DBy7t] [^114uHUtd] [^111eanHc].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about a single number fitting all scenarios. In toxic megacolon, transverse colon distension around or above 5.5–6 cm on imaging correlates with severity and poor response to medical therapy, but the mechanism and perforation risk differ from ACPO, so the cecal 12 cm rule should not be directly transplanted to toxic megacolon. Likewise, in mechanical obstruction, the cecum may be at risk at somewhat smaller diameters due to combined pressure and ischemia, and volvulus carries its own ischemic dynamics, so thresholds must be interpreted in pathophysiologic context [^116qZqZW] [^115yKAfe].

> Let me synthesize a clinically usable answer. For ACPO, a cecal diameter greater than 12 cm is the most robust and widely adopted threshold indicating high risk of impending rupture and the need for urgent decompression or surgery, with risk rising further beyond 14 cm. In the setting of mechanical large-bowel obstruction or volvulus, many clinicians consider cecal diameters approaching 9–10 cm as worrisome and an indication for expedited decompression or operative planning, especially with concerning clinical signs or prolonged duration, acknowledging that the evidence base is weaker and more heterogeneous for these lower cutoffs [^117DBy7t] [^113F9kNr] [^114uHUtd] [^112v6PH1].

> I should double-check management implications so the threshold is actionable. When cecal diameter exceeds 12 cm or ACPO persists beyond 48–72 hours without improvement, guidelines recommend escalation from conservative measures to neostigmine or colonoscopic decompression, and surgical consultation for possible cecostomy or colectomy if ischemia, perforation, or clinical deterioration is present; this aligns with ASGE and ASCRS guidance and underscores why serial abdominal films or CT to track cecal size and clinical status are standard of care in ACPO [^111eanHc] [^113F9kNr] [^114uHUtd].

> But wait, what if the colon is chronically dilated, as in acquired megacolon or megarectum. In chronic idiopathic megacolon, the sigmoid and rectum can exceed 6.5–10 cm chronically without imminent rupture, yet these patients remain at nontrivial risk of ulceration and perforation during acute episodes of severe distension or stasis; thus, chronic baseline enlargement does not confer immunity to diastatic rupture under acute stress, and management should remain vigilant for abrupt clinical deterioration [^112x37oy] [^116ZjzFr].

> Final answer, keeping the caveats explicit: the colon most often ruptures at the cecum when the cecal diameter exceeds about 12 cm in the setting of acute colonic pseudo-obstruction, with risk escalating beyond 14 cm. In mechanical obstruction or volvulus, impending rupture may occur at somewhat smaller cecal diameters, often around 9–10 cm, particularly with prolonged distention or ischemic features. In toxic megacolon, transverse colon distension above roughly 5.5–6 cm signals severity rather than a cecal rupture threshold, so the 12 cm cecal rule should not be extrapolated there. Duration of distention beyond 4–6 days independently increases risk and should prompt escalation regardless of the exact diameter [^117DBy7t] [^113F9kNr] [^114uHUtd] [^116qZqZW] [^113EfJ9X].

The colon is at **highest risk of rupture when the cecum exceeds 12 cm** [^117DBy7t] on imaging, especially if distention persists beyond 4–6 days [^114uHUtd] or the patient is elderly or comorbid [^notfound]. Risk rises progressively with larger diameters: 10–12 cm is concerning, 12–14 cm is high risk, and > 14 cm confers a 23% perforation risk with high mortality [^111PZzLn]. Prompt decompression is indicated when the cecum reaches 12 cm or distention lasts > 4–6 days [^114uHUtd] to prevent rupture and its complications [^111eanHc].

---

## Anatomical and physiological factors influencing rupture risk

Several factors influence **colonic rupture risk**:

- **Cecal vulnerability**: The cecum has the largest diameter and thinnest wall, making it most susceptible to rupture under pressure [^112Mk2Yj].

- **Laplace's law**: Wall tension rises with radius and internal pressure, increasing rupture risk as the cecum dilates [^117EDq3f].

- **Wall composition**: The cecum's thinner muscularis propria and higher compliance further increase rupture risk [^112Mk2Yj].

---

## Clinical evidence on colonic rupture diameter

Multiple studies and guidelines converge on **cecum-specific thresholds**:

| **Cecal diameter (cm)** | **Clinical significance** | **Risk of rupture** |
|-|-|-|
| < 9 | Low risk | Minimal |
| 9–12 | Moderate risk | Increased |
| > 12 | High risk | Significant |
| > 14 | Very high risk | 23% perforation rate |

---

- **> 12 cm**: Strongly associated with ischemia and perforation; prompt decompression is recommended [^117DBy7t] [^113F9kNr].

- **> 14 cm**: Perforation risk rises to 23% with high mortality [^111PZzLn].

- **9–12 cm**: Concerning, especially with prolonged distention or comorbidities [^112v6PH1].

---

## Duration of distention and rupture risk

Prolonged distention independently increases rupture risk: **< 4 days** carries moderate risk, 4–6 days confers high risk, and > 6 days represents very high risk with a markedly increased rupture risk. Early recognition and intervention are critical to prevent complications [^117DBy7t] [^113F9kNr].

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing rupture risk

Certain patient characteristics **heighten risk**:

- **Age**: Older patients have higher rupture risk due to reduced tissue elasticity and comorbidities [^113TehsX].

- **Comorbidities**: Cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and renal failure increase risk [^notfound].

- **Medications**: Opioids, anticholinergics, and corticosteroids impair motility and increase risk [^112v6PH1].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Guidelines recommend **intervention when the cecum exceeds 12 cm** or distention persists beyond 4–6 days [^114uHUtd]. Initial management is supportive, with escalation to pharmacologic (neostigmine) or endoscopic decompression if no improvement occurs [^111eanHc]. Surgery is indicated for refractory cases, ischemia, or perforation [^115eAEJK].

---

## Clinical implications and management strategies

Early recognition and intervention are essential to prevent rupture and its complications. Management includes **supportive care** — correcting electrolytes, stopping offending medications, and nasogastric decompression [^113vM3oe] — and **definitive therapy** with colonoscopic decompression or neostigmine if conservative measures fail [^111eanHc]. Surgery is reserved for refractory cases or complications such as ischemia or perforation [^115eAEJK].

---

## Conclusion

The colon is at **highest risk of rupture when the cecum exceeds 12 cm**, particularly with prolonged distention or comorbidities. Early recognition and prompt decompression are critical to prevent rupture and its complications.

Colonic volvulus — initial evaluation should include a focused history, physical examination, and basic laboratory assessment. Grade of recommendation: Strong recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 1C. Presenting symptoms are often nonspecific and may include abdominal pain, bloating, or cramping, nausea, emesis, and obstipation; physical examination typically reveals a distended and tympanic abdomen, and digital rectal examination usually reveals an empty vault. Although the duration of symptoms before presentation ranges from a few hours to several days, cecal volvulus tends to present more acutely, whereas sigmoid volvulus often has a more indolent presentation. Emergency presentation, with clinical signs of peritonitis or shock related to ischemia or perforation occurs in up to 25% and 35% of patients with sigmoid and cecal volvulus. It may be difficult to obtain an accurate history in patients with neuropsychiatric disorders and those residing in long-term care facilities, and laboratory testing is often helpful; in general, the history and physical examination and/or radiological evaluations occur in parallel to facilitate care.

Often patients have been admitted with a pathology outside the GI tract such as patients who have had orthopaedic, gynaecological cardiac procedures, or have been admitted with medical (non‐surgical) diagnoses. Patients with pseudo‐obstruction are frequently significantly poly‐morbid and frail and have electrolyte disturbance or acute renal failure. The condition is also described after caesarean section.

There is a high in‐hospital mortality rate associated with this condition (up to 8%). Thus, these patients need to be closely monitored and managed urgently. This may include serial abdominal X‐rays which allow assessment of caecal diameter, a crucial aspect to guide further management. A caecal diameter of 9–12 cm is concerning for impending perforation. Given the high association with renal dysfunction and electrolyte disturbance, monitoring of serum biochemistry can provide indications that the diagnosis might be that of pseudo‐obstruction but risk profile analysis alone is insufficient to diagnose this condition.

In order to establish the diagnosis of pseudo‐obstruction and exclude any mechanical cause a CT with intravenous contrast may be required. In this setting oral and rectal contrast are not used routinely in the UK and offer little benefit. If rectal contrast is used then a water‐soluble contrast agent such as Gastrografin should be used, because of the risk of perforation.

Question 5.8

What are the initial treatment options in pseudo‐obstruction?

Recommendation: Identification and correction of any renal dysfunction or electrolyte abnormality and review of prescribed medications is appropriate. Provided the patient remains stable with no peritonism or tenderness over the caecum and the caecal diameter is < 12 cm, conservative management can be continued for 48–72 h.

Level of evidence: III

Grade of recommendation: C

Consensus: 100% (SA 55.6%, A 44.4%)

Pseudo‐obstruction is associated with electrolyte disturbance and acute renal failure. Careful correction of these disturbances can be associated with resolution of the pseudo‐obstruction in the absence of any further management. Calcium, magnesium, potassium and sodium levels should be monitored and corrected as required. Acetylcholine enhances motor transit and peristalsis in the human colon. Therefore, any disturbance or reduction in acetylcholine production increases the risk of pseudo‐obstruction. Accordingly, a careful review of prescribed medications is required to exclude, where possible, any opiate or anticholinergic medications. Nasogastric tube decompression may be considered along with increasing patient mobility or simple frequent positional changes in bed including lying on the abdomen, if possible.

The particularities of the elderly in acute pathologies encountered in the general population

Bowel obstruction

Bowel obstruction is the most common cause of emergency surgery in the elderly. While Small Bowel Obstructions (SBO) are far more common than Large Bowel Obstructions (LBO) in the general population, older patients proportionally exhibit a significantly higher number of LBOs, particularly obstructive colorectal cancer (Table 3). Recent studies indicate that the prevalence of emergency surgery for colorectal cancer increases from 11% in patients under 65 to 29% in those over 85.

LBO due to colon cancer

Most acutely obstructive colon cancers occur on the left side, more commonly in the sigmoid colon, because of its narrow luminal diameter. CT findings include asymmetric and short-segment colonic wall thickening or an enhancing soft-tissue mass centered in the colon that narrows the colonic lumen with or without findings of ischemia and perforation (Fig. 6). Obstructing colon cancers often exhibit a shouldering appearance and may be large enough to have central necrosis or, in rare cases, air may be present within the mass, resembling an abscess. Recognition of proximal colonic dilatation aids in identifying the transition point at the tumor site; however, spasm at the splenic flexure in a normal colon can mimic a fixed narrowing. Dilatation of the ascending and transverse colon with distal collapse can be observed in both LBO and chronic colonic pseudo-obstruction. The accurate assessment of obstructive colon cancer is of importance since different options (Hartmann's procedure, resection with or without primary anastomosis, decompression with proximal colostomy, tube decompression or endoscopic colic stenting) are available for its treatment, depending on the CT results and on the age of the patient. It has been demonstrated in a multicentric national cohort, including 3 groups of patients (< 75 years, 75–84 years, and ≥ 85 years) that the oldest patients had higher morbidity with lower survival.

Perforation or impending perforation in colon cancer — recommendation 18 indicates that resection following established oncological principles with a low threshold for performing a staged procedure is recommended when feasible (strong recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 1C); patients with perforated cancers have significantly lower five-year disease-free survival and overall survival and higher rates of metachronous peritoneal carcinomatosis, and patients with free perforations have worse overall survival than those with contained perforations; in cases with perforation of uninvolved colon proximal to an obstructing tumor, resection of the tumor following usual oncological principles is recommended and the perforated segment should be addressed by repair or resection with or without diversion according to standard surgery principles; an anastomosis (with or without proximal diversion) may be considered in selected patients with minimal contamination, healthy tissue quality, and clinical stability, whereas with contained or free-perforation complicated by abscess or peritonitis, oncological resection with end ostomy should be considered; the use of a self-expanding metal stent is contraindicated in the setting of perforated colon cancer.

Colon stenting — conclusion: Although colon stenting is an available option for the management of MCO, controversy regarding its role compared with urgent colectomy continues to evolve, and there is no longer a "one-size-fits-all" approach that can be applied to all patients; it is important for physicians to understand their limits and expertise and recognize when cases are best managed at experienced high-volume centers.

Nonoperative methods of colonic decompression are generally recommended in patients who have failed supportive measures, are not candidates for conservative management, or in whom neostigmine is contraindicated or ineffective. Notably, as there are no prospective head-to-head trials between decompressive colonoscopy and neostigmine therapy, no recommendation can be made for the superiority of one of these options; the choice of treatment strategy should also depend on local expertise and situation, e.g. access to urgent colonoscopy. Nonetheless, prompt endoscopic decompression by means of colonoscopic desufflation is recommended in cecal diameter > 12 cm or if the syndrome exists longer than 4–6 days. The risk of ACPO recurrence after successful decompression varies widely in the literature, ranging from 0 to 50%, and repeated endoscopic decompressions with colonic tube placement as an alternative may be considered in these cases.

Patients that are refractory to pharmacologic and endoscopic decompression, especially those not amenable to surgical intervention due to an increased perioperative risk, should be considered for PEC. The necessary steps include good bowel cleansing, use of sedation, disinfection of the abdominal wall, transillumination, and fixation of the colon to the abdominal wall. As mortality rates are substantial in ACPO patients requiring surgical interventions, all efforts should be made to manage this patient population nonoperatively. Surgery is the most appropriate step in cases complicated by peritonitis, colonic ischemia, and/or perforation or when all other options fail, and it includes surgically placed cecostomy tube, colostomy, or subtotal colectomy.

### Acute colonic obstruction [^1136nAL6]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

Acute colonic obstruction is a medical emergency because of the potential for bowel ischemia, perforation, and sepsis with peritonitis if not rapidly and appropriately treated. There are numerous causes of acute colonic obstruction, which must be differentiated from colonic pseudo-obstruction, which also is considered a medical emergency. Management options include medical therapy, surgical therapy, endoscopic therapy, and interventional radiologic therapy. Self-expandable metal stents (SEMS) have gained acceptance for alleviating acute malignant colonic obstruction and in some situations for preoperative relief of acute benign colonic obstruction. This article reviews the approach to the patient who has acute colonic obstruction.

### Symptoms and diagnostic criteria of acquired megacolon-a systematic literature review [^112j2gty]. BMC Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Imaging

Imaging, usually barium enema, has been used. The bowel appears as a grossly elongated and dilated colon with multiple loops. The Preston et al. (1985) study, referenced by six studies in this review, proposes that rectosigmoid diameter at the pelvic brim exceeding 6.5 cm as diagnostic. Gladman et al. (2007) reported weaknesses with this study involving their choice of control group, despite its use by many later reports. A mean sigmoid diameter around 10 cm is suggested. The sigmoid is often involved radiologically, but AMC may exclusively affect the proximal colon, for which this definition is not suitable.

Simple 2D imaging has limitations in assessing colonic diameters and variations occur between serial images. There seems little doubt that the increasing availability of CT colonography using standardised insufflation pressure will optimise the diagnosis of AMC. CT colonography has the advantage of being a quantitative imaging modality and offers an alternative approach to evaluate the colon and rectum following incomplete colonoscopy. Low radiation dose imaging is also possible with modern scanners. CT Colonography allows simple measurement of colonic diameters and length from multiple views, has shorter procedure times, does not require recovery supervision and carries less procedural risks than traditional colonoscopy. It currently has a prominent role following incomplete colonoscopy - a common occurrence amongst patients with AMC. The use of this modality is limited in screening as biopsy and polypectomy cannot be performed.

Colonoscopy

Many colonoscopists seem confident about diagnosing AMC or colonic redundancy, although no objective criteria for diagnosis have been defined. This modality, does however, depend upon subjective interpretation. AMC or colonic redundancy have been associated with incomplete colonoscopy, as a result, may not be the most appropriate investigation for this population group. Hanson et al. (2007), analysed the colonic length of patients with redundant colon during colonoscopy using CT colonography. This study reported patients with incomplete colonoscopy as having colonic lengths exceeding 200 cm, often reported as redundant colon during colonoscopy. Colonic redundancy was defined as elongated and tortuous colons or those with two or more acute flexures. Although the diagnosis of AMC was not pursued in this study, it may suggest that CT colonography is a useful modality to diagnose abnormal colonic dimensions, both in terms of length, diameter and possibly volume.

### Performing high-quality, safe, cost-effective, and efficient basic colonoscopy in 2023: advice from two experts [^113Z9kxK]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Based on published evidence and our expert experience, we provide recommendations to maximize the efficacy, safety, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness of routine colonoscopy. High-quality colonoscopy begins with colon preparation using a split or same-day dose and preferably a low-volume regimen for optimal patient tolerance and compliance. Successful cecal intubation can be achieved by choosing the correct colonoscope and using techniques to facilitate navigation through challenges such as severe angulations and redundant colons. Safety is a primary goal, and complications such as perforation and splenic rupture can be prevented by avoiding pushing through fixed resistance and avoiding loops in proximal colon. Furthermore, barotrauma can be avoided by converting to water filling only (no gas insufflation) in every patient with a narrowed, angulated sigmoid. Optimal polyp detection relies primarily on compulsive attention to inspection as manifested by adequate inspection time, vigorous probing of the spaces between haustral folds, washing and removing residual debris, and achieving full distention. Achieving minimum recommended adenoma detection rate thresholds (30% in men and 20% in women) is mandatory, and colonoscopists should aspire to adenoma detection rate approaching 50% in screening patients. Distal attachments can improve mucosal exposure and increase detection while shortening withdrawal times. Complete resection of polyps complements polyp detection in preventing colorectal cancer. Cold resection is the preferred method for all polyps < 10 mm. For effective cold resection, an adequate rim of normal tissue should be captured in the snare. Finally, cost-effective high-quality colonoscopy requires the procedure not be overused, as demonstrated by following updated United States Multi Society Task Force on Colorectal Cancer postpolypectomy surveillance recommendations.

### Is pneumatosis cystoides intestinalis gas-distended and ruptured lymphatics? Reappraisal by immunohistochemistry [^114Hj2W3]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Context

Pneumatosis cystoides intestinalis (PCI) is a condition with multiple gas-filled cysts within the bowel wall, associated with diverse background diseases. Its pathogenesis is still a mystery. Some previous observations scattered in the literature have suggested an association of the cystic spaces in PCI with the lymphatics.

Objective

To further investigate whether PCI results from the ballooning of gas-filled lymphatic channels.

Design

We did immunostaining of podoplanin, a mucoprotein preferentially expressed in lymphatic endothelial cells, in 13 cases (8 men, 5 women; age range, 18–80 years) of PCI. Ten cases were diagnosed in resected segments of bowel and 3 in biopsies. Pneumatosis was seen in the right side of the colon (9 cases), transverse colon (1 case), sigmoid colon (1 case), and small bowel (2 cases). In addition, immunostaining for CD31, calretinin, WT1, CD68, smooth muscle actin, desmin, vimentin, and cytokeratins was also performed for comparison and correlation.

Results

A strong immunopositivity of podoplanin was seen in a condensed linear structure in the pericystic interstitium in 100% of the cases, but was not seen in the overlying giant and flat cells that were all CD68-positive histiocytes. Meanwhile, the podoplanin-expressing structure was negative for calretinin and WT1, which ruled out the possible mesothelial origin. There were coexistent variable immunopositivity of smooth muscle actin, which suggests an admixture of myofibroblasts. These findings indicated that the PCI cases were gas-distended lymphatics with the lymphatic epithelium ruptured and embedded in the reactive histiocytes and giant cells.

Conclusion

Our findings support the lymphatic theory about the pathogenesis of PCI.

### Water enema multidetector CT technique and imaging of diverticulitis and chronic inflammatory bowel diseases [^113CMWkZ]. Insights Into Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

Exam interpretation and pitfalls

WE-MDCT is a reproducible technique that does not need complex post processing or 3D interpretation; therefore, a very short learning curve is to be expected for radiologists who are familiar with abdominal studies. Images are routinely reconstructed along axial, coronal, and sagittal planes; however, the attending radiologist usually reviews the study on a dedicated workstation with the possibility to save arbitrary reconstruction images focussed on the key findings, including oblique or curved-planar reformations. In WE-MDCT, optimal contrast is observed between the well-distended lumen with water density, the enhanced colonic wall, and the normal fat-density pericolonic planes (Fig. 1). Mural thickness should be measured in a non-dependent, well-distended portion. In a well-distended bowel, the normal mural thickness should not exceed 2–3 mm. During exam interpretation, radiologists should carefully search for non-distensible segments along the large bowel with or without prestenotic dilatations (diameter over 5 cm), signs of mural thickening, hyperenhancement, and/or stratification, endoluminal projections, and diverticular outpouchings. Perivisceral fat changes such as increased density, hypervascularisation, adipose proliferation, or adenopathies should be sought. Furthermore, WE-MDCT allows comprehensive imaging of associated or incidental abnormalities involving the abdominal organs, lymph nodes, peritoneum, mesentery, retroperitoneum, lumbar and pelvic skeleton.

Perforation secondary to diverticulitis is estimated at 4/100,000 population per year predominantly involving the sigmoid colon. In addition to typical features of diverticulitis, extraluminal air/contrast and pericolic abscesses can be found in localised perforation, while extensive peritonitis occurs in free perforation into the peritoneal cavity (Fig. 23). Less frequently, perforated sigmoid diverticulitis follows an extraperitoneal route. Purely retroperitoneal forms are exceedingly rare.

### Diverticular disease of the colon [^113hWnfY]. Lancet (2004). Excellent credibility.

Colonic diverticulosis refers to small outpouchings from the colonic lumen due to mucosal herniation through the colonic wall at sites of vascular perforation. Abnormal colonic motility and inadequate intake of dietary fibre have been implicated in its pathogenesis. This acquired abnormality is typically found in developed countries, and its prevalence rises with age. Most patients affected will remain entirely asymptomatic; however, 10–20% of those affected can manifest clinical syndromes, mainly diverticulitis and diverticular haemorrhage. As our elderly population grows, we can anticipate a concomitant rise in the number of patients with diverticular disease. Here, we review the incidence, pathophysiology, clinical presentation, and management of diverticular disease of the colon and its complications.

### Acute colonic pseudo-obstruction with bowel rupture after caesarean section in HELLP syndrome: a case report [^117EDq3f]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

Every 12–24 h, it is recommended to monitor vital signs and the abdominal plain film and perform continuous abdominal examination, ACPO's early sign is anal exhaust or defecation. However, defecation does not represent the recovery of normal intestinal function, and some patients still have a chance of experiencing further deterioration. Imaging- and abdominal examinations have important guiding significance for disease prognosis.

If the conservative treatment is ineffective, timely surgical treatment is needed. Surgical treatment need is mainly observed in unresponsive symptoms or progressive aggravation, especially when the cecum diameter is > 12 cm or the abdominal distention lasts for more than 6 days and there is peritoneal irritation or air under the diaphragm. According to Laplace's law, the cecum diameter is the most important, because it is the most likely area for perforation to occur. Some studies have shown the need for surgical treatment when the cecum diameter is > 9 cm and is accompanied by intestinal ischemia. When the cecum diameter is > 14 cm, the incidence of complications is 23%. According to a retrospective analysis of 66 patients, intestinal perforation occurred in all patients whose cecum diameter was > 12 cm, and in 3 of 17 patients whose cecum diameter was < 9 cm, most of the perforation occurred from the third day to the fifth day. If the cecum diameter is > 12 cm and dilation time is more than 6 days, the incidence of colon necrosis or perforation is 3–10%. An analysis of 221 patients with ACPO showed that the ACPO mortality rate was 15%. When the cecum diameter was > 14 cm, the mortality rate doubled, and the decompression delay was more than 7 days. In comparison to the 4-day delay, the mortality rate increased 4 times. The risk factors for death from ACPO were old age (> 60 years old), caecal diameter > 14 cm, and long duration of colonic dilatation (> 4 days). However, some studies have similarly demonstrated that for emergency surgery, it depends more on the urgency of the patient's symptoms than the colon diameter. Many patients have dimensions larger than this value (12 cm for the cecum) without sequelae. The acuteness of the disease and the duration of continuous expansion may affect the risk of perforation.

### CT colonography: current status and future promise [^113kWjzm]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

CT colonography (CTC) is an innovative technology that entails CT examination of the entire colon and computerized processing of the raw data after colon cleansing and colonic distention. CTC could potentially increase the screening rate for colon cancer because of its relative safety, relatively low expense, and greater patient acceptance, but its role in mass colon cancer screening is controversial because of its highly variable sensitivity, the inability to sample polyps for histologic analysis, and lack of therapeutic capabilities. This article reviews the CTC literature, including imaging and adjunctive techniques, radiologic interpretation, procedure indications, contraindications, risks, sensitivity, interpretation pitfalls, and controversies.

### What are the predictive factors of caecal perforation in patients with obstructing distal colon cancer? [^113EfJ9X]. Colorectal Disease (2018). Low credibility.

Aim

In the presence of large bowel obstruction, the choice of treatment is determined by the patient's general status, the tumour characteristics and the perceived risk of caecal perforation. This study was designed to evaluate the predictive factors of impending caecal perforation, and also investigated the use of caecal volumetry.

Method

From January 2011 to June 2016, patients with obstructive distal colon cancer undergoing emergency laparotomy, for whom a pretreatment CT scan was available, were included in this retrospective, case-control, two-centre study. Two patient groups were defined: patients with and without impending caecal perforation. The primary end-point of the study was a determination of predictive factors for caecal perforation.

Results

A total of 72 patients (45 men, 62.5%) were included. Univariate analysis revealed that the presence of pericaecal fluid (P < 0.0001), caecal pneumatosis (P < 0.0001), mean maximum caecal diameter (P = 0.001), mean caecal diameter at the ileocaecal junction (P = 0.0001) and mean caecal volume (P = 0.001) were associated with caecal perforation. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis revealed that a caecal volume greater than 400 cm 3 (P < 0.0001), a maximum caecal diameter > 9 cm (P = 0.002) and a caecal diameter at the ileocaecal junction > 7.5 cm (P = 0.001) were associated with impending caecal perforation. In multivariate analysis, only caecal volume > 400 cm 3 (P = 0.001) was correlated with the risk of impending caecal perforation.

Conclusion

Caecal volumetry is an easy and useful tool to predict impending caecal perforation in patients with large bowel obstruction.

### The effect of luminal content and rate of occlusion on the interpretation of colonic manometry [^113KdVmv]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Manometry is commonly used for diagnosis of esophageal and anorectal motility disorders. In the colon, manometry is a useful tool, but clinical application remains uncertain. This uncertainty is partly based on the belief that manometry cannot reliably detect non-occluding colonic contractions and, therefore, cannot identify reliable markers of dysmotility. This study tests the ability of manometry to record pressure signals in response to non-lumen-occluding changes in diameter, at different rates of wall movement and with content of different viscosities.

Methods

A numerical model was built to investigate pressure changes caused by localized, non-lumen-occluding reductions in diameter, similar to those caused by contraction of the gut wall. A mechanical model, consisting of a sealed pressure vessel which could produce localized reductions in luminal diameter, was used to validate the model using luminal segments formed from; (i) natural latex; and (ii) sections of rabbit proximal colon. Fluids with viscosities ranging from 1 to 6800 mPa s(-1) and luminal contraction rates over the range 5–20 mmHg s(-1) were studied.

Key Results

Manometry recorded non-occluding reductions in diameter, provided that they occurred with sufficiently viscous content. The measured signal was linearly dependent on the rate of reduction in luminal diameter and also increased with increasing viscosity of content (R(2) = 0.62 and 0.96 for 880 and 1760 mPa s(-1), respectively).

Conclusions & Inferences

Manometry reliably registers non-occluding contractions in the presence of viscous content, and is therefore a viable tool for measuring colonic motility. Interpretation of colonic manometric data, and definitions based on manometric results, must consider the viscosity of luminal content.

2) Toxic megacolon

Statement 5.2.1

In patients presenting with toxic megacolon complicated by perforation, massive bleeding (unstable patients), clinical deterioration, and signs of shock, surgery is mandatory (QoE A).

Statement 5.2.2

In patients presenting with toxic megacolon, showing no clinical improvement and biological signs of deterioration after 24–48 h of medical treatment, surgery is mandatory (QoE B).

Recommendation

We recommend not delaying surgery in critically ill patients presenting with toxic megacolon (strong recommendation based on moderate -level evidence 1C).

Summary of evidence and discussion

Toxic megacolon is a rare but severe and potentially fatal complication of colonic inflammation.

Its main characteristics are as follows:
Radiographic evidence of total or segmental colonic distention of > 6 cm
Presence of systemic toxicity
Inflammatory (or infectious) etiology.

In order to avoid colectomy, medical treatment should be carried out aggressively and in a timely fashion (steroids, fluids, transfusions, etc.) and the correct timing for surgery is still controversial. In fact, while some evidence suggests that the initial medical treatment obviates the need for surgery in about 50% of patients, there is a significant body of literature that highlights how a delay in surgical intervention carries the risk of colonic perforation and abdominal compartment syndrome, thus increasing the mortality rate. For these reasons, management of toxic megacolon requires coordination between medical and surgical services with aggressive attempts at medical therapy and early surgical intervention in the absence of improvement, development of complications, or deterioration. Frequent re-evaluations must be performed until the patient's condition has clearly improved or until there is evidence of deterioration, in which case urgent surgery is indicated. Persistent fever after 48–72 h of steroid therapy should raise the possibility of local perforation or abscess. Free perforation, massive hemorrhage, increasing transfusion requirements, increasing signs of toxicity, and progression of colonic dilatation are indications for an urgent operation.

Unlike colonic obstruction, in which cecal dilation with perforation is a concern, the transverse colon is the area of greatest concern in toxic megacolon. Perforation in patients with toxic megacolon is associated with a high mortality rate (27–57%), regardless of whether the perforation is contained or free.

3) Uncontrolled gastrointestinal bleeding

Statement 5.3.1

Pre-operative localization of the bleeding site, with the aim of excluding an upper gastrointestinal or an anorectal bleeding will allow better planning of the surgical strategy (QoE C).

Acute colonic pseudo-obstruction (ACPO) — initial evaluation should include focused history, examination, laboratories, and diagnostic imaging with preferred modalities to exclude mechanical obstruction. Recommendation 11 states: Initial evaluation should include a focused history and physical examination, baseline laboratory values, and diagnostic imaging. Grade of recommendation: Strong recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 1C. Typical signs and symptoms include abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, abdominal distension, altered bowel function, and dilation of the ascending and transverse colon without evidence of mechanical obstruction on imaging, and routine laboratory testing, such as a basic metabolic panel, should be included during the initial evaluation. For diagnosis, computed tomography or water-soluble contrast enema can reliably distinguish ACPO from a mechanical large-bowel obstruction, and unless there is a high suspicion for a distal obstruction, endoscopy is not typically recommended for diagnostic purposes given the associated risk of perforation in the setting of colon dilation.

Colon ischemia (CI) colonoscopy physiology and insufflation — hemodynamic effects and perforation data are summarized as follows: "intraluminal pressures of the magnitude generated during colonoscopy and BE examinations, i.e., 30–60 mm Hg, reduced intestinal blood flow", and cadaver studies showed "air pressures of 52–230 mm Hg, and intraluminal pressures that ruptured the cecum and sigmoid were 81 and 169 mm Hg respectively". During routine colonoscopy in three patients, pressures "ranged from 9 to 57 mm Hg when the tip of the colonoscope was free in the lumen of the bowel and 34–138 mm Hg when the tip was impacted against the colonic wall". Regarding insufflation, "Carbon dioxide has been recommended for colonoscopy (and virtual colonography) because it is 10 times more rapidly absorbed from the bowel than is room air", and "CO2 increased colonic blood flow in contrast to room air that, at similar pressures, decreased blood flow". Clinically, "There are currently no studies looking at perforation rates in patients undergoing colonoscopic evaluation of CI", but a 2010 cohort "included 251 patients… using room air for insufflation; none of these colonoscopies were complicated by perforation", and another series reported "Of the 442 hospitalizations for CI… 408 colonoscopic evaluations… there were no documented perforations", supporting that "there does not seem to be a higher perforation rate in patients who undergo colonoscopic evaluation".

### American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy guideline on the role of endoscopy in the management of acute colonic pseudo-obstruction and colonic volvulus [^117XwCei]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2020). High credibility.

Sigmoid and cecal volvulus — initial endoscopic management states that patients with signs of peritonitis, perforation, or with recurrent or unsuccessful nonoperative decompression should be referred immediately for surgical management, whereas when these are absent, nonoperative detorsion with flexible sigmoidoscopy with or without placement of a decompression tube is considered first-line therapy in sigmoid volvulus; in contrast, surgical management is preferred over colonoscopy in patients with cecal volvulus because endoscopic reduction is rarely effective and is associated with a higher risk of perforation. The endoscopic appearance of sigmoid volvulus is characterized by 2 points of abrupt twisted or converging colon mucosa, and if passage through the twisted segment is successful, aggressive decompression of the dilated colon segment should be performed and will often result in spontaneous detorsion.

### Giant colonic volvulus due to colonic pseudo-obstruction [^116dv8rg]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

Acute colonic pseudo-obstruction (ACPO), also known as Ogilvie's syndrome, is a clinical syndrome characterised by gross dilation of the caecum and right hemicolon, which sometimes extends to the sigmoid colon and rectum in the absence of an anatomic lesion in the intestinal lumen. It is characterised by impaired propulsion of contents of the gastrointestinal tract, which results in a clinical picture of intestinal obstruction. A careful examination of the markedly distended colon can exclude several colonic pathologies, including mechanical obstruction and other causes of toxic megacolon. ACPO can sometimes predispose or mimic colonic volvulus, especially in geriatric patients.

### A new look at toxic megacolon: an update and review of incidence, etiology, pathogenesis, and management [^114XB8kj]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2003). Low credibility.

Toxic megacolon (TM) is an infrequent but devastating complication of colitis. Numerous forms of colonic inflammation can give rise to TM but the majority occur in individuals with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Recently there has been a marked increase in the number of reports of TM associated with pseudomembranous colitis. Because of the associated high morbidity and mortality, early recognition and management of TM is of paramount importance. The mechanisms involved in development of TM are not clearly delineated, but chemical mediators such as nitric oxide and interleukins may play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis. New evidence suggests that TM and its associated morbidity may be predicted by the extent of small bowel and gastric distension in patients with colitis. CT scanning may also play an important role the management of TM, in that it may be the only noninvasive mode to detect subclinical perforations and abscesses. Management involves close medical attention, supportive care, and treatment of the underlying colitis. Possible exacerbating factors such as narcotic and anticholinergic medications must be withdrawn, and colonic decompression via tube drainage or positional techniques must be considered. Signs of progression or complications of the disease must be treated aggressively with surgical intervention, as delay is associated with even greater risk of mortality.

### Blowhole colostomy for the urgent management of distal large bowel obstruction [^114s8HSp]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Complete obstruction of the distal colon or rectum often presents as a surgical emergency. This study evaluated the efficacy of blowhole colostomy versus transverse loop colostomy for the emergent management of distal large intestinal obstruction.

Methods

Retrospective chart review of all colostomy procedures (CPT 44320) performed for complete distal large bowel obstruction during the past 6 y in a university hospital practice was undertaken. Blowhole was compared with loop colostomy with a primary endpoint of successful colonic decompression.

Results

One hundred forty-one patients underwent colostomy creation during the study period. Of these, 61 were completed for acute obstruction of the distal colon or rectum (19 blowhole versus 42 loop colostomy). No differences between study groups were seen in age, gender, body mass index, malnutrition, American Society of Anesthesiology class, time to liquid or regular diet, 30-d or inhospital mortality, or rates of complications. Patients undergoing blowhole colostomy had significantly higher cecal diameters at diagnosis (9.14 versus 7.31 cm, P = 0.0035). Operative time was shorter in blowhole procedures (43 versus 51 min, P = 0.017). Postoperative length of stay was significantly shorter for blowhole colostomy (6 versus 8 d, P = 0.014). The primary endpoint of successful colonic decompression was met in all colostomy patients.

Conclusions

Diverting blowhole colostomy is a safe, quick, and effective procedure for the urgent management of distal colonic obstruction associated with obstipation and massive distention.

COLONIC VOLVULUS AND PSEUDO‐OBSTRUCTION

Introduction

The term 'volvulus' is used to describe an abnormal twist of the stomach, small intestine or colon. This can lead to impaired blood supply, ischaemia, infarction and/or perforation. Volvulus of any aspect of the GI tract is a general surgical emergency. The most common area of the GI tract to develop volvulus in adults is the colon, with the sigmoid and caecum being particularly at risk. Volvulus leads to between 2% and 15% of all large bowel obstructions in the developed world but the incidence varies greatly across the globe.

The evidence base for volvulus of the colon is poor and there are few evidence‐based recommendations available to guide clinical practice. A similar lack of synthesized evidence is available for pseudo‐obstruction, a functional distention of the colon without an underlying structural blockage. There is an estimated incidence of 100 cases in 100 000 admissions to US hospitals. Pseudo‐obstruction can occur after other non‐GI insults such as burns, cardiac and orthopaedic procedures, intercurrent illnesses or after caesarean section. As such, pseudo‐obstruction, also known as Ogilvie's syndrome, is a common reason for inter‐specialty referrals to the general surgical team.

Previous literature has demonstrated variability in the clinical management of patients with these conditions and there are few UK standards or recommendations. However, there is recently published guidance from the ASCRS.

Colonic volvulus

Question 5.1

Are there any diagnostic clinical features of colonic volvulus?

Recommendation: A combination of abdominal distention, complete/absolute constipation and known risk factors (elderly, frail, comorbidity, constipation and neurological conditions) should alert the clinician to the possibility of a colonic volvulus.

Level of evidence: IV

Grade of recommendation: D

Consensus: 100% (SA 100%)

The clinical presentation of sigmoid and caecal volvulus is that of large bowel obstruction. Abdominal distention, cramping abdominal pain, vomiting and nausea are commonplace. Volvulus appears to be associated with a wide, long mesocolon compared with control patients, rendering a mesenteric twist easier to occur. The specific mechanism by which the twist occurs, however, is unclear. Sigmoid volvulus is more common than caecal and transverse colonic volvulus is rare.

### Gastrointestinal perforation: clinical and MDCT clues for identification of aetiology [^111PZzLn]. Insights Into Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

Acute colonic pseudo-obstruction (Ogilvie's syndrome) usually affects patients with significant comorbidities or postoperatively. CT findings comprise marked diffuse dilatation of colonic and rectal lumen without a transition point to collapsed bowel. Although perforation is a rare complication (1–3%), carrying a 50–71% mortality rate, the risk increases up to 23% when caecal diameter is > 14 cm.

In Ehler-Danlos syndrome, spontaneous perforation is the most common GIT complication, affecting most commonly the sigmoid colon. Perforation usually occurs early in the disease (mean age of presentation 24–26 years), usually precedes arterial or solid organ rupture and can be the first symptom in a young patient otherwise undiagnosed with Ehler-Danlos syndrome.

Perforation from blunt trauma is uncommon, being reported in approximately 0.5% of all major blunt traumas, more commonly in the sigmoid, right colon and cecum. Transverse colon injury may coexist with pancreatic and/or duodenal injury. Oral contrast administration, when not contraindicated in the emergency setting, can increase the detection rate of bowel wall thickening and small mesenteric hematomas. Free fluid typically forms polygonal-shaped collections among loops and within mesenteric folds. Traumatic perforation of a retroperitoneal segment tends to remain localised adjacent to the injury site.

Colonic perforation in inflammatory bowel disease is rare, with free perforation occurring in about 3% of patients with Crohn's, less common compared with sealed-off perforations. Free perforation from ulcerative colitis occurs in about 2% of patients and is associated with toxic megacolon.

Presenting symptoms, imaging and clinical considerations in relation to site and causes of colorectal perforation are summarised (Table 3).

A 27-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with a 24-hour history of severe left iliac fossa pain associated with vomiting. She reported a history of ovarian cysts and was provisionally diagnosed with a ruptured ovarian cyst and admitted under the obstetrics and gynaecology team for further investigation. 24hours later, she became haemodynamically unstable with increasing abdominal distention and developed a metabolic acidosis. A CT scan revealed large bowel obstruction (LBO) secondary to a faecal bolus in the sigmoid colon with appearances suggestive of adult-onset Hirschsprung's disease. She underwent an emergency laparotomy and decompressive transverse colotomy and was admitted to the intensive care unit overnight. After discharge, she presented again with small bowel obstruction (SBO) which resolved with conservative management. A follow-up colonoscopy and biopsies showed no anatomical abnormalities to account for the LBO and were inconclusive for Hirschsprung's disease.

### Management of colonoscopic perforation: a systematic review and treatment algorithm [^113cXur9]. Surgical Endoscopy (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The aim of this review is to evaluate and summarize the current strategies used in the management of colonoscopic perforations as well as propose a modern treatment algorithm.

Methods

Articles published between January 2004 and January 2019 were screened. A total of 167 reports were identified in combined literature search, of which 61 articles were selected after exclusion of duplicate and unrelated articles. Only studies that reported on the management of endoscopic perforation in an adult population were retrieved for review. Case reports and case series of 8 patients or less were not considered. Ultimately, 19 articles were considered eligible for review.

Results

A total of 744 cases of colonoscopic perforations were reported in 19 major articles. The cause of perforation was mentioned in 16 articles. Colonoscopic perforations were reported as a consequence of diagnostic colonoscopies in 222 cases and therapeutic colonoscopies in 248 cases. The site of perforation was mentioned in 486 cases. Sigmoid colon was the predominant site followed by the cecum. The management of colonoscopic perforations was reported in a total of 741 patients. Surgical intervention was employed in 75% of the patients, of these 15% were laparoscopic and 85% required laparotomy. The predominant surgical intervention was primary repair.

Conclusion

Management strategies of colon perforations depend upon the etiology, size, severity, location, available expertise, and general health status. Usually, peritonitis, sepsis, or hemodynamic compromise requires immediate surgical management. Endoscopic techniques are under continuous evolution. Newer developments have offered high success rate with least amount of post-procedure complications. However, there is a need for further studies to compare the newer endoscopic techniques in terms of success rate, cost, complications, and the affected part of colon.

Follow-up of ICP

Is there any recommendation to perform a surveillance endoscopy after successful ICP treatment? If any, what is the recommended timing for it?

At present, there are no studies in the literature focusing on the indications and timing for surveillance endoscopy after successful ICP treatment. However, based on the available evidence and clinical experience, a surveillance colonoscopy may be performed based on the initial indication (e.g. benign or malignant pathology) and type (e.g. screening or interventional) of the primary colonoscopy (during which the ICP occurred) and considering the risk-benefit ratio of performing an endoscopic exam.

Colonoscopy is specifically contraindicated in cases of known or suspected perforation. Consequently, any endoscopy after ICP treatment should be performed once the colonic wall has completely healed. Assuming that the healing time after ICP treatment is comparable to that after surgical sutures or anastomosis, a surveillance endoscopy may be indicated after approximately 3 months from the successful ICP treatment, depending on the size of the perforation and the type of repair.

In general, prior to any surveillance colonoscopy, it is necessary to carefully re-evaluate the presence of specific conditions favoring perforation, including increasing age, female gender, low BMI, intensive care unit stay, inpatient setting, diverticular disease, Crohn's disease, obstruction as an indication for the primary colonoscopy, and invasive interventional colonoscopy. Indeed, colonoscopy is contraindicated whenever the risks for the patient's health or life are judged to outweigh the most favorable benefits of the procedure.

Statement 17

17.1. In cases of perforation occurring during a diagnostic colonoscopy for screening or surveillance of colorectal cancer, a repeat endoscopy is indicated within 3 to 6 months postoperatively if the screening or clearing colonoscopy was incomplete due to malignant obstruction or inadequate preparation (Recommendation Grade 1C).
17.2. In cases of perforation occurring during a colonoscopy for gastrointestinal bleeding, a surveillance endoscopy is indicated for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes; in cases of acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding, it is necessary to ascertain the resolution of the perforation (Recommendation Grade 1C).
17.3. In cases of perforation occurring during an operative colonoscopy (e.g. polypectomy, endoscopic mucosal resection, or endoscopic submucosal dissection), a surveillance colonoscopy should be performed according to the current guidelines to determine whether the resection during the primary endoscopy was complete. The surveillance endoscopy can be performed within 3 to 6 months from the operative colonoscopy during which the ICP occurred in cases of incomplete resection (Recommendation Grade 1C).

### Acute colonic pseudo-obstruction with bowel rupture after caesarean section in HELLP syndrome: a case report [^115dbE1e]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

An accurate diagnosis is still difficult. ACPO symptoms generally manifest within 48 h after surgery and within 12 days at the longest. Abdominal distention and tenderness were the most common symptoms, followed by vomiting. The abdominal X-ray plain film or CT examination mainly showed the expansion of the cecum and the ascending colon. Evident abdominal tenderness, fever, leucocytosis, and caecal dilatation > 12 cm are factors that may indicate colonic ischemia or perforation.

The treatment for ACPO is essentially colonic decompression. Conservative treatment is preferred, while laparotomy is contraindicated in the absence of peritonitis. If continuous examination and abdominal X-ray do not indicate colonic ischemia, perforation, or impending perforation, it can be treated conservatively for several days. The success rate of conservative treatment ranges between 77 and 96%, and remission is usually within 3–5 days. It involves avoiding opioids and other drugs to inhibit intestinal peristalsis, a correction of hyperproteinaemia, electrolyte disorder, and acid-base imbalance, continuation of gastrointestinal decompression, administration of barium enemas, treatment of other potential diseases or infection, and the use of neostigmine if necessary. Neostigmine is an anti-cholinesterase inhibitor, and its therapeutic purpose is to improve the colonic peristalsis caused by sympathetic stimulation or parasympathetic dysfunction. Because of the risk of bradycardia, its use should be closely monitored and corrected with atropine if necessary. Barium enemas can not only alleviate the disease but also indicate colon expansion and are helpful to eliminate mechanical intestinal obstruction. However, it increases the risk of intestinal perforation. Surprisingly, it has been suggested that chewing gum can promote the recovery of intestinal function, and irritant laxatives, which can aggravate colonic distention, should be avoided. Bargiela et al. reported a case of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) symptom relief after treatment with a potassium-sparing agent. If the cecum's diameter is > 9 cm, it can be decompressed by colonoscopy if the conservative treatment is ineffective. Some consider colonoscopy better than treatment with neostigmine and even suggested it as a first-line treatment. This is because the success rates of colonoscopy decompression and neostigmine treatments were 74 and 29%, respectively. Nonetheless, about 10% of patients experience a certain degree of colon ischemia during colonoscopy; therefore, indications should be strictly controlled, considering a perforation rate of 1–3%.

What are the key factors upon which to choose the best surgical approach for ICP?

The choice of the surgical approach and technique mainly depends on the underlying pathology (e.g. colon cancer, diverticulitis) and the size of the ICP. Primary surgical repair can be used if the colonic tissue appears healthy and well vascularized and if suturing the perforation edges could be performed without tension. Wedge resection is feasible if it does not imply an excessive narrowing of the colonic lumen (e.g. cecum). Whenever the perforation is too large, the edges appear devitalized, or an avulsion of the adjacent mesocolon is seen, colonic resection might constitute the best option. Generally, patients who undergo surgery within 24 h are more appropriate candidates for less invasive techniques, such as primary suturing of the defect or linear wedge resection. In cases of delayed surgery (> 24 h from the colonoscopy), extensive peritoneal contamination, important comorbidities, or a deterioration of the general status of the patient (i.e. sepsis), a staged repair or colostomy by exteriorization of the perforation (e.g. double-barreled colostomy) must be considered.

Currently, there are no prospective or retrospective studies in the English literature comparing the different types of repair (primary suture or wedge resection vs. segmental resection). Therefore, the choice of the surgical technique appears to be mainly empirical, and it is left to the surgeon's discretion according to the intraoperative findings. Independent of the surgical approach, the main goal of the therapy is the rapid diagnosis, repair, and prevention of abdominal sepsis. If an ICP is to be repaired laparoscopically, the operating surgeon and the surgical team should be comfortable with the laparoscopic techniques, such as mobilization of the colon and intracorporeal suturing. A clinical algorithm mainly based on the size of the perforation and the necrotic area was proposed in 1999 to assist in choosing which type of repair to perform. The maximal size for sutured repair was set at 1 cm. Between 1 and 2.5 cm, a transverse tangential stapled resection was recommended, whereas above 2.5 cm, a segmental resection was indicated. The condition of the bowel to be repaired and the level of contamination and inflammation are the most important factors in determining whether the laparoscopic approach is safe. Both sutured and stapled repair techniques seem to be safe and feasible to repair defects of up to 4 cm.

In case of perforated colon cancer, surgery must follow the oncologic principles of cancer resection.

### Diagnosis and management of colonic volvulus [^113BqBPV]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2021). Medium credibility.

Case Summary

An 88-year-old man with no significant medical history, and in a good state of health, presented to the emergency department with 4 days of obstipation, progressive abdominal pain, and bloating. Examination revealed abdominal distension and generalized tenderness without signs of peritonitis. Laboratory values, including lactate and complete blood count, were within normal limits. Computed tomography imaging of the abdomen and pelvis revealed radiological signs of sigmoid volvulus and no evidence of bowel perforation (Fig. 1). Flexible sigmoidoscopic examination revealed no evidence of mucosal ischemia and enabled detorsion of the colon. The patient's symptoms resolved after the detorsion. He was seen in consultation by a surgeon who advised surgical treatment only if the volvulus recurred. After hospital discharge, the patient self-educated about sigmoid volvulus and sought a second surgical opinion. Five weeks after his initial presentation and 1 week after complete colonoscopy, he underwent laparoscopic sigmoidectomy with colorectal anastomosis. His postoperative course was uneventful. At 6-month follow-up, he remained well with no bowel-related concerns.

### Acute colonic pseudo-obstruction with bowel rupture after caesarean section in HELLP syndrome: a case report [^112j6AiW]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Ogilvie syndrome, also known as acute colonic pseudo-obstruction (ACPO), can occur postpartum after caesarean section (C-section), often resulting in caecal dilatation. The incidence rate is approximately 100 cases in 100,000 patients per year (Ross et al. Am Surg 82:102–11, 2016). Without proper diagnosis and treatment, it may progress to intestinal perforation or other fatal complications.

Case presentation

A 39-year-old pregnant woman underwent emergency low-segment C-section due to complications of Haemolysis, Elevated Liver enzymes and Low Platelets syndrome (HELLP) syndrome. ACPO was suspected on the third day after C-section based on inability to pass flatus, evident abdominal distension, slight abdominal pain, and computed tomography (CT) scan revealing severe, diffuse colonic distention with caecal dilatation of approximately 9 cm. Based on these findings, conservative treatment was implemented. However, 6 days after C-section, her symptoms worsened, and CT showed possible intestinal perforation; thus, an emergency laparotomy was performed. Due to a 3-cm (diameter) laceration in the anterolateral wall of the ascending colon and a 5-cm tear in the ileocecal junction, in combination with mucosal eversion in the colon, resection of the ileocecum, distal closure of the ascending colon, and a terminal ileostomy were performed. The patient was discharged 2 weeks post-laparotomy and continued to undergo nursing care for the incision and stoma. Ileostomy was performed 4 months later.

Conclusion

Ogilvie syndrome after C-section is an extremely rare but severe condition, which warrants early recognition and treatment to prevent potentially fatal complications, especially in patients with poor health status.

### Diagnostic point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) for gastrointestinal pathology: state of the art from basics to advanced [^116RjjqD]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Intestinal obstruction

Intestinal obstruction is a common gastrointestinal emergency that needs rapid and efficient management. History, physical examination, and plain radiography are essential for its diagnosis. The role of ultrasonography in diagnosing intestinal obstruction is recognized since nearly four decades. Additionally, ultrasonography may help in detecting the cause and level of the obstruction.

The ultrasound examination should follow the anatomical path of the colon and small intestine. The normal bowel is seen as a circular hypoechoic structure (muscle layer) surrounding a mixture of hypoechoic (fluid), isoechoic (food), and hyperechoic contents (gas). The hypoechoic wall gets thinner during the relaxation period of peristalsis. The normal diameter of the bowel loops is up to 25 mm in the jejunum, up to 15 mm in the ileum, and up to 50 mm in the colon. POCUS provides answers to important clinical questions like: (1) Is there an obstruction? (2) Is the obstruction mechanical or functional? (3) Where is the location of the obstruction? (4) Is there ischaemia or necrosis of the bowel? and (5) What is the clinical progress of the patient who was treated conservatively?.

Ultrasound findings of small bowel obstruction include (1) increased loop dimensions, (2) increased wall thickness (more than 3 mm), (3) increased intestinal contents, (4) increased (to and fro) or decreased peristaltic movements, (5) enlarged and visible valvulae conniventes (more than 2 mm), and (6) collapsed colonic lumen. These findings are important to differentiate mechanical obstruction from functional obstruction. Dilated small bowel loops, full of gas and fluid, without peristalsis which is associated with colonic gas, fluid, or faeces should be considered as paralytic ileus. Diagnosing the location of the obstruction in the small bowel depends on the visibility of valvulae conniventes. These structures become prominent in the jejunal obstruction (Fig. 6a – d) and absent or rare in an ileal obstruction (Fig. 7a – d).

### Symptoms and diagnostic criteria of acquired megacolon-a systematic literature review [^114vrFJt]. BMC Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Acquired Megacolon (AMC) is a condition involving persistent dilatation and lengthening of the colon in the absence of organic disease. Diagnosis depends on subjective radiological, endoscopic or surgical findings in the context of a suggestive clinical presentation. This review sets out to investigate diagnostic criteria of AMC.

Methods

The literature was searched using the databases - PubMed, Medline via OvidSP, ClinicalKey, Informit and the Cochrane Library. Primary studies, published in English, with more than three patients were critically appraised based on study design, methodology and sample size. Exclusion criteria were studies with the following features: post-operative; megarectum-predominant; paediatric; organic megacolon; non-human; and failure to exclude organic causes.

Results

A review of 23 articles found constipation, abdominal pain, distension and gas distress were predominant symptoms. All ages and both sexes were affected, however, symptoms varied with age. Changes in anorectal manometry, histology and colonic transit are consistently reported. Studies involved varying patient numbers, demographics and data acquisition methods.

Conclusions

Outcome data investigating the diagnosis of AMC must be interpreted in light of the limitations of the low-level evidence studies published to date. Proposed diagnostic criteria include: (1) the exclusion of organic disease; (2) a radiological sigmoid diameter of ~10 cm; (3) and constipation, distension, abdominal pain and/or gas distress. A proportion of patients with AMC may be currently misdiagnosed as having functional gastrointestinal disorders. Our conclusions are inevitably tentative, but will hopefully stimulate further research on this enigmatic condition.

### Ogilvie syndrome as a postoperative complication… [^114C2B4q]. JAMA Network (2000). Excellent credibility.

The size of the cecum was noted on radiographic reports of 27 patients. The average size of the cecum at diagnosis was 13. 4 ± 3. 0 cm. The abdominal roentgenogram shown in Figure 1 is of a 51-year-old previously healthy man who underwent an open reduction and internal fixation of his left scapula. Colonic dilation in the absence of mechanical obstruction after operation is indicative of Ogilvie syndrome. The hallmark of the syndrome is abdominal distention with or without pain. Plain abdominal radiographs demonstrate massive colonic dilation, especially of the cecum and right colon. Jetmore et al5 collected data between 1983 and 1989 and found that 27 of 56 patients with Ogilvie syndrome had undergone surgery. In my opinion, the current state of the art in the treatment of these patients is as follows. The diagnosis is usually clear.

These usually elderly patients have marked abdominal distention and radiographs that demonstrate colonic distention without evidence of obstruction. Cecal diameter is at least 10 cm, usually greater than 12 cm. These missed patients could affect your findings and conclusions. Second, the average size of the cecum at diagnosis was 13. 4 cm, but the range was as low as 8 cm. Most authors require a cecal diameter of 10 or even 12 cm prior to making the diagnosis of colonic pseudo-obstruction. Could you comment on how you make the diagnosis. What do you think the role of contrast studies is in the workup of these patients. Dr Smith: How did we make the diagnosis. It was a combination of clinical examination with findings of abdominal distention as well as radiographic confirmation of dilatation of the cecum. Why did we choose 8 cm as our threshold. There are several reasons. First of all, the definition of Ogilvie syndrome is actually quite nebulous in the literature.

Previous authors have used diameters from 9 to 12 cm. We chose to use 8 cm because we wanted to throw a broad net to include all potential patients with Ogilvie syndrome in our retrospective review. Additionally, we were interested in detecting patients who were early in the course of the process and we wanted to include these patients in our review as well. For these reasons we chose 8 cm as a cecal diameter consistent with Ogilvie syndrome.

### Life threatening rupture of the diaphragm after COVID 19 pneumonia: a case report [^113kWtGZ]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The incidence of diaphragmatic rupture is low; however, it may be life threatening. Normally caused by blunt trauma, some cases are reported after pulmonary infections with extensive coughing. Covid 19 causes pulmonary infections and pneumonia and has been associated with weakening of the diaphragm after prolonged ventilation. We present a patient who suffered from diaphragmatic rupture 2 months after recovering from a severe Covid 19 pneumonia.

Case

A 71 years old male patient presented with massive thoraco-abdominal pain and severe dyspnea. At the time of admission, the patient was diagnosed with rupture of the diaphragm and developed cardiogenic shock. Intraoperatively there was a 4 cm diameter large rupture of the diaphragm with enterothorax (transverse colon, stomach, spleen, parts of the jejunum). Avulsion of the mesenteric arteries made a segmental resection of the jejunum together with the spleen necessary. A jejuno-jejunostomy was performed and organs were replaced into the abdomen. The rupture of the diaphragm underwent primary closure with non-resorbable suture material. The patient has shown an uneventful post-operative course, fully recovered and was discharged on day 11 after surgery.

Conclusion

Covid 19 is a disease that is known to have various effects on different organs. The diaphragm is only paid heed in case of dysfunction. Also in the setting of Covid 19 it is not known as prominent effector organ. Nevertheless its affection by coughing caused by Covid 19 can lead to life threatening complications.

### 2017 WSES guidelines for the management of iatrogenic colonoscopy perforation [^112Mk2Yj]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

What is the minimum information the endoscopist must report after diagnosing an ICP during a colonoscopy procedure?

Perforation during diagnostic or screening endoscopic procedures may occur from one of these two main pathways: (a) direct mechanical damage to the colonic wall by the tip or the side of the endoscope as it is pushed forward or (b) a pneumatic distension due to barotrauma (Table 4). Direct mechanical trauma is the most frequent etiology of ICP, and perforations originating from mechanical trauma are commonly large and located in the sigmoid region. The injury is usually produced by direct trauma due to an inaccurate instrumental insertion, colonoscope movements toward the mucosal surface, retro-flexion maneuvers, or excessive torsion. Indirect injuries can also occur as the consequence of bowing or stretching the distal part of the colon. The presence of redundant colon diverticula or adhesions from previous surgeries can increase the risk of mechanical trauma during colonoscopy. Barotrauma is instead produced by the excessive distension of the bowel due to over-insufflation, which produces linear lacerations at the colonic wall that may evolve into full-thickness defects. This type of perforation is more frequently located at the cecal region, where the thinner muscular layer and the larger lumen diameter make this region more vulnerable to pressure-related injuries. For interventional endoscopies, the mechanism of perforation can be the same as those occurring during diagnostic endoscopy, or they may be due to thermal/electrical injury of the colonic wall, manifesting as a wall ischemia. In this latter case, the perforation can occur with a delay of 24–72 h. Wall damage can be incomplete and the perforation concealed as it is confined by the surrounding tissues. During the following days or weeks, an abscess may develop that may delay the diagnosis.

Table 4
Main etiologies of iatrogenic colonoscopy perforation (ICP)

Up to 60% of ICPs are detected by the endoscopist while performing the procedure. In a retrospective evaluation of a single institution, 68% of ICPs were identified on the day of endoscopy, 23% on day 1 or 2 after the endoscopy, and 9% were identified at least 2 weeks after the procedure. The results of a survey of 30,336 colonoscopies showed a mean delay of 0.36 days for the diagnosis of ICP after diagnostic endoscopies and 1.5 days after therapeutic procedures.

### Neuromechanical factors involved in the formation and propulsion of fecal pellets in the guinea-pig colon [^111RcyeQ]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The neuromechanical processes involved in the formation and propulsion of fecal pellets remain incompletely understood.

Methods

We analyzed motor patterns in isolated segments of the guinea-pig proximal and distal colon, using video imaging, during oral infusion of liquid, viscous material, or solid pellets.

Key Results

Colonic migrating motor complexes (CMMCs) in the proximal colon divided liquid or natural semisolid contents into elongated shallow boluses. At the colonic flexure these boluses were formed into shorter, pellet-shaped boluses. In the non-distended distal colon, spontaneous CMMCs produced small dilations. Both high- and low-viscosity infusions evoked a distinct motor pattern that produced pellet-shaped boluses. These were propelled at speeds proportional to their surface area. Solid pellets were propelled at a speed that increased with diameter, to a maximum that matched the diameter of natural pellets. Pellet speed was reduced by increasing resistive load. Tetrodotoxin blocked all propulsion. Hexamethonium blocked normal motor patterns, leaving irregular propagating contractions, indicating the existence of neural pathways that did not require nicotinic transmission.

Conclusions & Inferences

Colonic migrating motor complexes are responsible for the slow propulsion of the soft fecal content in the proximal colon, while the formation of pellets at the colonic flexure involves a content-dependent mechanism in combination with content-independent spontaneous CMMCs. Bolus size and consistency affects propulsion speed suggesting that propulsion is not a simple reflex but rather a more complex process involving an adaptable neuromechanical loop.

### What are the risk factors of colonoscopic perforation? [^115ZisJT]. BMC Gastroenterology (2009). Low credibility.

Colonoscopy is generally performed with intravenous sedation and analgesia because it is sometimes painful and causes patient discomfort. Several studies have suggested that sedation in colonoscopy is associated with a higher percentage of complete examinations. Colonoscopy under intravenous sedation appears to increase risk of CP in the present study. It is possible that an endoscopist has difficulty in recognizing over-stretching of the bowel wall in the deep-sedated patients, thus leading to mechanical injury to the colon. Perhaps, endoscopists manipulate the scope non-forcefully and more gently in patients without sedation.

Based on our study, there was no significant difference in the perforation rate between procedures carried out by gastroenterologists (0.15%) and ones by surgeons (0.14%). This finding was confirmed by other investigators. Patient gender was also not predictive of CP in the present study; however, some authors have shown that female patients were at greater risk of the perforation. Interestingly, Saunders and co-workers demonstrated that women had a greater colonic length and a more mobile transverse colon. Other risk factors for CP reported in the literature could include a history of diverticular disease or previous intra-abdominal surgery.

Although a relatively small number of potential risk factors for CP were recorded and analyzed in the present study, they are among the fundamental parameters commonly used for patient risk prediction. Future research should investigate further possible factors influencing CP, such as the quality of bowel preparation, previous intra-abdominal or pelvic operation, prior pelvic radiotherapy, a previous history of intra-abdominal or pelvic infection, diverticular disease, presence of colonic malignancy and co-morbidities. Meanwhile, given the rarity of the perforation incidence, data collection from several endoscopic centers, in order to increase the sample and event size as well as analysis of other potential risk factors, would give physicians more insights into what increases the incidence of CP and how to avoid or minimize it.

### Imaging the operated colon using water-enema multidetector CT, with emphasis on surgical anastomoses [^113zj8wP]. Insights Into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Expected CT appearances after colorectal surgery

In the left-sided colon, colo-colic anastomoses are generally shaped end-to-end, since the bowel lumen has a similar diameter on both sides. In normal conditions, the colonic wall thickness at a surgical anastomosis should not exceed 3–4 mm (Figs. 2, 3). In a common clinical situation, WE-MDCT may be indicated before elective recanalisation 4–6 months following an urgent Hartmann's procedure (HP) to treat complicated diverticulitis, obstructing or perforated CRC. In HP, segmental resection of the sigmoid or descending colon is completed with creation of a temporary diverting end colostomy to avoid the risk of anastomotic dehiscence, and a blind-rending rectal stump is left in place (Fig. 1). Following elective sigmoidectomy with primary reconstruction, WE-MDCT shows mild shortening of the large bowel and a patent end-to-end colo-colic anastomosis with normal mural thickness (Fig. 2). Anterior rectal resection (ARR) involves removal of the distal sigmoid colon, recto-sigmoid junction and most of the rectum and may be reconstructed with either a coloanal (in low ARR) or colorectal anastomosis with the preserved terminal rectum. After standard (Fig. 3) or extended left colectomy, a long colonic segment is removed, extending from the sigmoid to the splenic flexure or transverse colon respectively, with the hepatic flexure at its normal site.

Physical dimensions

A variety of studies recorded colonic diameters of patients with AMC or provided dimensions used to diagnose its presence (Table 3). Recent contributions on this topic emphasise colonic diameter as a defining feature. Earlier studies referred to length. Twelve studies used barium enema or similar studies. Taylor et al. (1980) was the only study to use abdominal X-rays.

a amongst patients with volvulus

Using 50 double contrast barium enema studies, Preston et al. (1985) concluded a normal diameter of the rectosigmoid at the pelvic brim was less than 6.5 cm. Six studies of this review used this criterion to diagnose AMC. The three studies, Preston et al. (1985), Iantorno et al. (2007) and Koch et al. (1993) calculated mean sigmoid diameters of 10+/− 3.5 cm, 10+/− 2 cm and 10 cm respectively for sigmoid-inclusive AMC.

The presence of colonic reduplications, angulations or loops seen during barium studies or enema-filled sigmoid loops rising above the iliac crests was described by Kantor (1924). Taylor et al. (1980) diagnosed AMC by an increased colonic diameter on radiological imaging and chronic constipation. Ryan (1982) described the recurrence of both colonic dilatation and symptoms in patients who had undergone segmental colectomy for megacolon volvulus of previously non-dilated segments.

Kantor (1924) demonstrated the limitations of simple X-ray techniques, with individual colonic dimensions varying significantly with serial imaging amongst individuals.

### CT colonography: revisited after 30 years [^114meJDm]. Insights Into Imaging (2025). Medium credibility.

CTC risks and complications

The X-ray exposure for CTC is 1–3 mSv every 3–5 years, depending on the surveillance frequency, compared to natural radiation of 4.5 mSv per year. This low dose has been achieved by technological advancements in detectors and iterative reconstruction filters incorporating artificial intelligence.

Colorectal perforation during CTC is an exceptional complication. In a Japanese national survey, Nagata et al found the colorectal perforation rate during preoperative-staging CTC was 0.028%, while the perforation rates for screening and diagnosis were 0.003% and 0.014%, respectively. In a meta-analysis from Bellini et al based on 100,000 patients, the colorectal perforation rate after a CTC was 0.04% and only 0.02% in asymptomatic subjects, with an induced surgery rate of 0.008%.

The ability to use pressure and volume measurements as surrogate measures to determine distention adequacy to begin scanning leads to secure and highly reproducible colon distention. CTC is a minimally invasive and safe examination for patients when its contraindications are respected (Table 1).

### Expert consensus document: advances in the diagnosis and classification of gastric and intestinal motility disorders [^111VSRuh]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2018). Medium credibility.

- A barostat enables the assessment of colonic compliance, tone and phasic contractility.

The assessment of colonic compliance and tone requires a barostat device with a balloon placed into the colon endoscopically (FIG. 8). The barostat keeps intraballoon pressure at a pre-set level chosen to ensure apposition of the balloon to the colonic wall without relevant distension. Changes in baseline balloon volume thus reflect changes in colonic tone. Because the barostat can detect phasic contractions that are non-lumen occluding, this technique is also more accurate than manometry for detecting phasic contractions when the colonic diameter is increased (> 5.6 cm)(FIG. 8). Colonic compliance is a measure of the ease with which the colon can be distended and can be evaluated by recording changes of balloon volume in response to stepwise (usually 4 mmHg) increments of intraballoon pressure to 44 mmHg.

The physiological increase in colonic tone in response to a standard meal has been well characterized and varies among the segments of the colon. In the descending colon, a < 15% increase in tone after a meal suggests a relevant colonic motility disorder.

### American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy guideline on the role of endoscopy in the management of acute colonic pseudo-obstruction and colonic volvulus [^115eAEJK]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2020). High credibility.

Acute colonic pseudo-obstruction (ACPO) — surgical therapy is indicated when nonoperative treatments fail or specific high-risk features are present. For patients in whom conservative, pharmacologic, and endoscopic treatment options fail, surgical intervention is the next appropriate step in management, and patients presenting with peritonitis, ischemia, perforation, clinical deterioration, or cecal diameter greater than 12 cm should also be referred for surgery. Because mortality rates are substantial in patients with ACPO who require surgical intervention, all efforts should be made to manage these patients nonoperatively, and in patients with ischemic or perforated bowel, surgical mortality as high as 44% has been reported. Surgically placed cecostomy tubes are associated with substantial morbidity and mortality, and female gender, emergent admission, and increased comorbidities (specifically chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and metastatic cancer) have been identified as independent risk factors of colonoscopy failure.

### Small bowel and colon perforation [^116NQDGF]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

For patients with small bowel and colonic perforations, a definitive diagnosis of the cause of perforation is not necessary before operation. Bowel obstruction and inflammatory bowel disease are the most common causes of nontraumatic intestinal perforations in industrialized countries, whereas infectious causes of intestinal perforations are more common in developing countries. Treatment of small bowel and colonic perforations generally includes intravenous antibiotics and fluid resuscitation, but the specific management of the bowel depends on the underlying cause of the perforation.

### Symptoms and diagnostic criteria of acquired megacolon-a systematic literature review [^115meKZP]. BMC Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

For a condition that is sometimes treated surgically, Acquired Megacolon (AMC) is poorly understood and diagnostic criteria remain obscure. The term refers to a colon of increased diameter and increased length, in the absence of organic disease. The colon is often described as distended or dilated. Some authors differentiate 'colonic redundancy' from 'megacolon', by describing increased colonic length with reduplication, opposed to a colon of increased diameter. However, increased length and diameter often co-exist. The definition AMC used in this paper encompasses both increased colonic length and diameter with negligible rectal involvement where possible.

Many symptoms including constipation, distension, abdominal pain and a poor sense of wellbeing are attributed to AMC. Pathophysiology, natural history and effective symptom management, although speculated, are unknown. A large body of evidence exists, including literature reviews, which have analysed surgical outcomes for AMC and the diagnosis of idiopathic megabowel (megarectum-inclusive disease). However, consensus on diagnostic criteria is still lacking.

The objective of this systematic literature review is to refine diagnostic criteria for this condition and to evaluate symptoms and pathophysiology that may be associated with AMC.

We report a case of colonic perforation in CT colonography, which was observed in a sigmoid colon segment contained within an inguinal hernia. At surgery, apart from the perforation, a normal large-bowel wall was found. Although rare, perforation may occur in patients with normal bowel wall, possibly resulting from a mechanical strain caused by gaseous overdistention. Radiologists performing the procedure must be aware of this possibility.

### Rupture of the spleen after colonoscopy: a life-threatening complication [^115tJZNL]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

During colonoscopy, the risk of injuring the spleen or other viscera except the colon is negligible. We report here a patient in whom spleen rupture did complicate the very early course of colonoscopy, but this remains an extremely rare complication with no more than 50 cases so far described. Diagnosis may be difficult, and the risk of spleen rupture seems to be greatest within 24 hours of colonoscopy. Mechanisms leading to spleen injury in the setting of colonoscopy are unclear; however, direct trauma, colon distension by insufflated air, and the excessive traction on the splenocolic ligament may be involved. Patients with splenomegaly and those with preexisting adhesions are at greater risk for this complication. Patients complaining of persistent abdominal pain after colonoscopy should be closely monitored and aggressively investigated for the suspect of spleen injury and rupture.

### Gastrointestinal perforation: clinical and MDCT clues for identification of aetiology [^112WZSZs]. Insights Into Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

The accuracy of MDCT in predicting the perforation site is lower in colorectal perforations compared with upper GIT perforations. Direct findings include extraluminal gas and oral/rectal contrast, as well as wall discontinuity, faecal material looking like a "dirty" mass or foreign bodies protruding through the colonic wall or lying free within the abdominal cavity. Associated findings include bowel wall thickening, pericolonic fat stranding, free fluid, abnormal wall enhancement, abscess, and the presence of a localised inflammatory mass adjacent to the colon.

Free gas may be massive, especially if there is coexistent obstruction or following colonoscopy. Perforation of intraperitoneal colon, i.e. of cecum, transverse, sigmoid and upper 2/3 of the rectum, leads to pneumoperitoneum. Rupture of the retroperitoneal ascending and descending colon results in pneumoretroperitoneum at the right and left anterior pararenal spaces respectively. Posterior rectal perforations can dissect superiorly and cause bilateral pneumoretroperitoneum. In the setting of diverticulitis or malignancy without mechanical obstruction, perforation is often associated with small volume pneumoperitoneum by the perforation site. Free gas present only in the pelvis favours colonic rather than small bowel perforation.

Perforation complicates 2.6–10% of colon cancers, occurring most commonly in the sigmoid colon (47.3%) and cecum (24.8%). Two mechanisms are recognised: the first consists of tumour necrosis and subsequent perforation at the tumour site. The second occurs proximal to the malignancy, as a result of bowel distension secondary to obstruction, frequently occurs at the cecum and usually leads to massive pneumoperitoneum (Fig. 20) or pneumoretroperitoneum. Perforation secondary to tumour necrosis usually causes a small amount of free gas. Rarely, the colon perforates into the abdominal wall and patients may present with extensive cellulitis (Fig. 21). Differentiation between neoplastic and inflammatory causes is challenging; however, a mural wall thickness greater than 1.39 cm, the presence of irregular wall configuration, adjacent lymphadenopathy and metastatic disease favour malignancy since perforation is usually associated with an advanced tumour stage (Fig. 22).

Acute colonic pseudo-obstruction (ACPO) — operative management indications and outcomes: Operative treatment is recommended for ACPO complicated by colon ischemia or perforation or ACPO refractory to pharmacologic and endoscopic therapies; Grade of recommendation: Strong recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 1C. Persistent colon dilation refractory to nonoperative measures occurs in about 10% of patients, and colonic ischemia or perforation occurs in 3% to 10% of patients with ACPO, being more common with cecal diameter > 12 cm and/or duration of dilation > 6 days. An analysis of 106,784 National Inpatient Sample cases found that failure of medical management and colonoscopic decompression requiring surgery was associated with double the rate of complications versus medical management. In a literature review of 400 pooled patients from the preneostigmine era, 179 underwent operative intervention with an overall mortality of 30%; of these, 129 (72%) had an ostomy, 25 (14%) had a resection, and 25 (14%) had other operations. Perioperative mortality with viable (n = 125), ischemic (n = 18), and perforated (n = 36) bowel was 26%, 44%, and 36%, respectively, compared with mortality of 14% for supportive therapy alone (n = 120) and 13% for endoscopic treatment (n = 101). Risk factors for death included advanced age, cecal diameter > 14 cm, prolonged period (> 4 days) of colonic distension, and the requirement for operative intervention, and surgery most commonly involves stoma creation with or without resection.

### Simulations of the effects of scheduled abdominal aortic aneurysm repair on survival [^111exep3]. Anaesthesia (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

This paper simulates survival in patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms. The simulations address the following questions:
'How might a patient's general risk of dying – due to age, health and fitness – affect his/her survival trajectories with and without scheduled aneurysm repair?'
'How might the aneurysm diameter affect survival trajectories with and without scheduled repair?'
'How much does endovascular repair prolong survival compared with open repair?'
'When is the optimum time and what is the optimum aneurysm diameter to schedule repair and how are they affected by a patient's general risk of dying?'
'How applicable today are the results of randomised controlled trials of scheduled aneurysm repair conducted 20 years ago?'
'How might we quantify the net effect of scheduled aneurysm repair on survival – can we reasonably expect to distinguish between those whose lives would be shortened by surgery and those whose lives would be extended?'

Although ruptured aneurysms can kill, scheduled aneurysm repair can also kill. Patients with aneurysms can die from a myocardial infarction, pneumonia, colon cancer, a road traffic accident and by many mechanisms other than aneurysm rupture. A patient might reasonably anticipate that they would be counselled on the net survival effect of scheduled abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, as an individual, not as an elusive 'average' patient. Earlier repair of some aneurysms less than 55 mm diameter compared with later repair of some aneurysms, often less than 55 mm diameter, 22 years ago 1, had little effect on median survival, which has resulted in the crude conclusion that surgeons should avoid repair on male aneurysms less than 55 mm diameter. An even cruder conclusion is that in males, surgeons should repair aneurysms 55 mm diameter or larger, made in the absence of randomised controlled trials, supported by the weak logic that larger aneurysms are more likely to rupture and kill. The conclusion that a diameter of 55 mm divides injudicious surgery from injudicious surveillance ignores the massive variation in patients' life expectancies, their probabilities of dying before an aneurysm ruptures and their probabilities of dying as a result of having surgery.

Acute colonic pseudo-obstruction (ACPO), uncomplicated — For patients with uncomplicated ACPO (absence of ischemia, peritonitis, cecal diameter < 12 cm, and/or significant abdominal pain), we recommend conservative therapy as the preferred initial management including identifying and correcting potentially contributing metabolic, infectious, and pharmacologic factors.

### American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy guideline on the role of endoscopy in the management of acute colonic pseudo-obstruction and colonic volvulus [^116cbCmv]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2020). High credibility.

American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy guideline — epidemiology and clinical overview states that colonic volvulus and acute colonic pseudo-obstruction (ACPO) are 2 causes of benign large-bowel obstruction, with colonic volvulus occurring most commonly in the sigmoid colon. Large-bowel obstruction accounts for approximately 25% of all intestinal obstructions. Colonic volvulus is the most common cause of benign mechanical obstruction and accounts for approximately 3.5% of all cases of large-bowel obstruction in the United States and up to 50% in areas such as Africa and the Middle East. For ACPO, the exact pathophysiology is poorly understood, with the prevailing hypothesis being altered regulation of colonic function by the autonomic nervous system resulting in colonic distention in the absence of mechanical blockage. Prompt diagnosis and intervention leads to improved outcomes for both diagnoses, and endoscopy may play a role in the evaluation and management of both entities.

### Diverticular disease: diagnosis and treatment… [^113UAQZc]. AAFP (2005). Low credibility.

Acquired diverticula form through the relative weakness in the muscle wall of the colon at the site where arteries penetrate the muscularis layer to reach the mucosa and submucosa. Diverticula generally are multiple. Each diverticulum is typically 5 to 10 mm in diameter, but at times they can exceed 20 mm. The most common site is the sigmoid colon, although diverticula can occur throughout the large bowel, with right-sided disease being more common in Asians and in patients younger than 60 years. With macro-perforation, the resultant infection is less restricted, and peritonitis or a pericolonic abscess can occur. If this septic process erodes into adjacent structures, it may result in fistula formation. Because of the theoretic potential to exacerbate perforation, endoscopic examination is acutely contraindicated unless inflammatory bowel disease, ischemic colitis, or carcinoma is highly suspected.

17 Colonoscopy always should be performed six to eight weeks after recovery from acute diverticulitis to exclude coexisting neoplastic disease. Several surgical options are available, including resection with primary anastomosis, resection with colostomy and closure of the rectal stump, transverse colostomy and drainage, and laparoscopic colectomy. The decision about which option to choose is best guided by an experienced surgeon and the patient's preference. COMPLICATIONS Complications of diverticulitis include abscess, fistula, bowel obstruction, and free perforation. These complications all require surgical consultation. 3, 6 Peridiverticular abscesses can progress to form fistulas between the colon and surrounding structures in up to 10 percent of patients. Colovesical fistulas are the most common variety and require surgery for treatment. Fistulas involving the bladder are more common in men; in women, the uterus is interposed between the colon and the bladder.

Intestinal obstruction is uncommon in diverticulitis, occurring in approximately 2 percent of patients. The small bowel is affected most often, and obstruction usually is caused by adhesions. The colon can become obstructed because of luminal narrowing caused by inflammation or compression by an abscess. Multiple attacks can lead to progressive fibrosis and stricture of the colonic wall. Obstruction generally is self-limited and responds to conservative therapy. If persistent, obstruction of the colon can be treated by a variety of endoscopic and surgical techniques.

### What are the risk factors of colonoscopic perforation? [^116vu6RK]. BMC Gastroenterology (2009). Low credibility.

Results

Over a 3.5-year period, 10,124 endoscopic procedures of the colon (8,987 colonoscopies and 1,137 flexible sigmoidoscopies) were performed. Patients had an average age of 59 years (SD = 14.5, range 15–103) and 55 percent were female. Three main indications for endoscopic examination of the colon and rectum in this series were clinical suspicion of colorectal neoplasia, anemia or hematochezia work-up, and screening and surveillance of colorectal cancer. Forty-two percent of the patients underwent colonoscopy under sedation (n = 4,202). Therapeutic endoscopy and emergency endoscopy were performed in 24% (n = 2,385) and 0.7% (n = 75), respectively. Of therapeutic endoscopy, snared polypectomies were performed in 1589 cases (67%). Acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding was the major indication for emergency endoscopy.

Fifteen colonic perforations (0.15%) were identified; 14 from colonoscopy and one from flexible sigmoidoscopy. None occurred during emergency endoscopy. All the perforations were identified during or shortly after the procedure; extra-intestinal tissue was observed during the procedure in 13 cases (87%) and the others developed peritonitis within 24 hours after the procedure with the presence of pneumoperitoneum detected on a CT scan. The most common site of CP was in the sigmoid colon (n = 12, 80%), and followed by the transverse colon (n = 2, 13%) and the benign stricture site of ileorectal anastomosis (n = 1, 7%). Of these patients, three (20%) had concomitant colorectal cancer. All CP patients underwent surgical management. Types of operation included primary suture of the perforation in 5 patients (33%), resection and primary anastomosis in 4 patients (27%), and resection without anastomosis in 6 patients (40%). There were 2 deaths (women at the age of 76 and 83), accounting for 13% of CP patients and 0.02% of total colonic endoscopy.

### Temporal and multiinstitutional quality assessment of CT colonography [^117Tq4vv]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to investigate the variability of CT colonography (CTC) scan quality obtained within and between institutions by using previously validated automated quality assessment (QA) software that assesses colonic distention and surface area obscured by residual fluid.

Materials and Methods

The CTC scans of 120 patients were retrospectively selected, 30 from each of four institutions. The bowel preparation included oral contrast material for fecal and fluid tagging. Patients at one institution (institution 4) drank half the amount of oral contrast material compared with the patients at the other three institutions. Fifteen of the CTC scans were from the beginning of the protocol studied at each institution and 15 scans were from the same protocol acquired approximately 1 year later in the study. We used previously validated QA software to automatically measure the mean distention and residual fluid of each of five colonic segments (ascending, transverse, descending, sigmoid, and rectum). Adequate distention was defined as a colonic diameter of at least 2 cm. Residual fluid was determined by the percentage of colonic surface area covered by fluid. We compared how the quality varied across multiple institutions and over time within the same institution.

Results

No significant difference in the amount of colonic distention among the four institutions was found (p = 0.19). However, the distention in the prone position was significantly greater than the distention in the supine position (p < 0.001). Patients at institution 4 had about half the amount of residual colonic fluid compared with patients at the other three institutions (p < 0.01). The sigmoid and descending colons were the least distended segments, and the transverse and descending colons contained the most fluid on the prone and supine scans, respectively. More recently acquired studies had greater distention and less residual fluid, but the differences were not statistically significant (p = 0.30 and p = 0.96, respectively).

Conclusion

Across institutions, a significant difference can exist in bowel preparation quality for CTC. This study reaffirms the need for standardized bowel preparation and quality monitoring of CTC examinations to reduce poor CTC performance.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for small bowel obstruction, more specifically with respect to abdominal CT, WSES 2018 guidelines recommend to obtain a follow-up abdominal X-ray after 24 hours in patients who do not undergo immediate surgery. If the contrast has reached the colon, this is indicative for resolution of the bowel obstruction.

### Guidelenines in the management of obstructing cancer of the left colon: consensus conference of the World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) and peritoneum and surgery (PnS) society [^1159cBuQ]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Primary resection and anastomosis (PRA): total or subtotal colectomy (TC) vs. segmental colectomy (SC)

There is only one RCT, write out SCOTIA study group (Subtotal Colectomy versus on Table Irrigation and Anastomosis) in 1995, that compared the TC (47 patients) vs. SC (44 patients) and ICI. There were no differences in mortality, overall morbidity and rates of single complications (superficial and deep surgical site infections, anastomotic leakage). In regard of long-term outcomes, patients undergoing TC were noted to have a statistically higher number of daily bowel movements compared to ICI/SC. The authors concluded that SC following ICI should be therefore preferred to TC.

Another non-randomised study comparing the two techniques did not show any difference in mortality but showed significantly more surgical postoperative complications in the ICI group and in particular superficial surgical site infections.

TC as a one-stage resection anastomosis in OLCC allows the surgeon to encompass a massively distended and faecal-loaded colon; moreover the proximal colon dilatation makes difficult the detection of synchronous cancer and so TC could bypass the need for further operation especially in severely ill patients. However we can't extend the use of TC as a prophylaxis of future malignancy outside hereditary tumours syndromes.

In the 1980 s, segmental colectomy with ICI was suggested as an alternative operation. It has the benefit of making an anastomosis on a prepared bowel and preserving the normal colon. The main concerns are the prolonged operative time, the risk of spillage and contamination, and the need for increased expertise.

Absolute indications for STC in OLCC are right colon ischemia, cecal serosa tears or perforation, and synchronous proximal malignant tumours which occur in 3 to 10% of cases; it is a one stage radical oncological resection with advantages to treat synchronous proximal tumours, prevent metachronous cancer, to avoid stoma creation and to remove the colon as a septic content; but the major disadvantages are resection of healthy colon, resulting in poor functional results with many patients complaining of diarrhoea afterwards.

Recommendation: TC for OLCC (without cecal perforation or evidence of synchronous right colonic cancers) should not longer be preferred to SC with ICI, since the two procedures are associated with same mortality/morbidity, while TC is associated with higher rates impaired bowel function (Grade of recommendation 1A).

### The colon cutoff sign: an unusual indicator of urologic disease [^1118MDuc]. Urology (2008). Low credibility.

A 43-year-old obese, alcoholic woman presented to the emergency department with a 2-day history of gradual abdominal pain. An abdominal radiograph showed termination of colonic gas at the splenic flexure. Initial laboratory examinations are unremarkable. Computed tomography of the abdomen revealed left ureteral calculi with rupture and extravasation of contrast media over the upper-third ureter. To our knowledge, the colon cutoff sign is rarely been related to ureteral rupture. Recognition of the cause of colon cutoff sign on the computed tomographic scan is important because conventional radiography is often the first imaging modality requested for patients with abdominal complaints, but cannot give a confident correct diagnosis.

### Determination of normal distribution of distended colon volumes to guide performance of colonic imaging with fluid distention [^1157NB1r]. Current Problems in Diagnostic Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

The purpose was to determine the normal distribution of distended colon volumes as a guide for rectal contrast material administration protocols. All computed tomography colonography studies performed at Emory University Hospital, Atlanta, Georgia, between January 2009 and January 2015, were reviewed retrospectively. In total, 85 subjects were included in the analysis (64% [54 of 85] female and 36% [31 of 85] male). Mean patient age was 65 years (range: 42–86y). Distended colon volumes were determined from colon length and transaxial diameter measurements made using a 3-dimensional workstation. Age, sex, race, height, weight, and body mass index were recorded. The normal distributions of distended colon volumes and lengths were determined. Correlations between colonic volume and colonic length, and demographic variables were assessed. Mean colon volume was 2.1L (range: 0.7–4.4L). Nearly, 17% of patients had a distended colonic volume of > 3L. Mean colon length was 197cm (range: 118–285cm). A weak negative correlation was found between age and colonic volume (r = -0.221; P = 0.04). A weak positive correlation was found between body mass index and colonic length (r = 0.368; P = 0.007). Otherwise, no significant correlations were found for distended colonic volume or length and demographic variables. In conclusion, an average of approximately 2L of contrast material may be necessary to achieve full colonic opacification. This volume is larger than previously reported volumes (0.8–1.5L) for rectal contrast material administration protocols.

### Preoptimisation in patients with acute obstructive colon cancer (PREOCC)-a prospective registration study protocol [^117T49z6]. BMC Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Refraining from emergency surgery in OCC can be a barrier for professionals because of concern for complications due to the distended (small) bowel and colon. Adequate management of the obstruction is crucial, while left untreated the obstruction could lead to bowel necrosis, perforation, and ultimately death. However, the feasibility of different staged procedures has been demonstrated over the years, such as SEMS and decompressing ileo- or (transverse) colostomy for left-sided OCC. Non-surgical bowel decompression by nasogastric tube for (right-sided) OCC has not yet been proved in large studies. We realise that concerns may be raised over the strategy to decompress the small bowel and proximal colon in patients with an imminent or complete obstruction in OCC. Therefore, daily assessment of the patients with right-sided OCC in this study is crucial. In case a caecum dilation > 10 cm, decompression is immediately needed, while this extensive diameter is often accompanied by a competent ileocecal valve. Clinical and biochemical values need to be monitored carefully, and immediate interference is needed in case of abdominal pain, increase of leukocytes or C-reactive protein, to prevent bowel necrosis, perforation of a blowout. The feasibility of postponing surgery without decompressing stent or ileostomy as a bridge to surgery has recently be confirmed in a recent study of Fahim et al. This study included all consecutive bowel obstruction patients treated with dietary adjustments, laxatives and prehabilitation before resection. In this study a total of 24 patients with bowel distention receiving TPN, reported emergency surgery in only 25% of the patients, while 75% of these patients were treated electively after 7–10 days of prehabilitation. This study differs from this study protocol while they also included benign disease. However, the feasibility of postponing surgery without SEMS or decompressing ileostomy was showed. In addition to this study, a retrospective pilot study performed in the Amphia hospital confirmed the feasibility of postponing surgery as well. In a total of 16 patients presenting with right-sided OCC, bowel decompression using a nasogastric tube was performed and emergency interference was not needed.

### Ogilvie's syndrome following caesarean section [^117EVGWd]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Acute colonic pseudo-obstruction syndrome, also known as Ogilvie's syndrome, is a rare condition associated with significant morbidity and mortality. We report a case that developed very rapidly after emergency caesarean section. A 20-year-old woman underwent an emergency caesarean section for failure to progress in the first stage of labour and a healthy male infant was delivered without incident. However, soon afterwards the patient developed significant abdominal distension and pain. Ogilvie's syndrome was diagnosed following an abdominal x-ray which revealed a gross large bowel obstruction without mechanical cause. To prevent caecal rupture, the patient underwent successful emergency colonic decompression.

### Acute colonic pseudo-obstruction with bowel rupture after caesarean section in HELLP syndrome: a case report [^114u59kD]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute colonic pseudo-obstruction (ACPO), also known as Ogilvie's syndrome, is an organic disease caused by colonic dysfunction, which may be related to the inhibition of autonomic nervous function in the colon. It is mainly characterised by an acute and extensive expansion of the colon, mainly in the cecum and the right colon. The incidence of ACPO after caesarean section (C-section) is extremely low, making it a rare obstetric complication. A study reported the postpartum incidence of ACPO to be 1:1460 deliveries, and another report estimated its prevalence to be 0.4% following C-section. Its symptoms are easily obscured by postoperative wound pain and uterine contractions, and the specific mechanism underlying its manifestation remains unknown. Patients experience mild symptoms, such as abdominal pain, abdominal distention, and vomiting, which may worsen, leading to bowel necrosis, perforation, and colon torsion. According to various reports, the risk of spontaneous colon perforation varies between 3 and 25%, and the associated mortality rate is as high as 50%. Therefore, early recognition and management is crucial for improving prognosis. In this study, we report a case of HELLP with ACPO and colonic rupture after C-section.

### Impending cecal perforation secondary to a crushing injury of the pelvis… [^115TQtc9]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

The purpose of this article is to report a case of adynamic ileus of such severity that the alarming distention of the cecum induced us to perform a cecostomy. The operative findings, substantiated by the final pathologic report, would indicate that, without surgical intervention, perforation of the cecum, with its alarming high mortality, would assuredly have occurred. Roentgenographic studies relating the greatest cecal diameter to impending cecal perforation pertain to ileus secondary to obstructing lesions of the colon distal to the cecum. In the cases reviewed by Davis and Lowman, 9 cm. is cited as the critical dimension beyond which cecal perforation was liable to occur. Eckman, Wenzke, and Abramson have recently reported a case of adynamic ileus in an elderly woman resulting in cecal perforation and her death. The greatest cecal diameter in their case was 9 cm. Their review of the recent literature indicated no other case reports MOORE CE, KOMAN GM.

Figure 3
Transverse view of sigmoid colon post-perforation, with free air and faeces in the abdomen.

Megacolon and/or megarectum are rare conditions defined as dilatation of the colon not caused by mechanical obstruction. It is classified by different values depending on the location of the dilatation in the colon. In the rectosigmoid region, a diameter greater than 6.5 cm is used. It can be divided up into acute, chronic or toxic megacolon. Chronic megacolon occurs when this dilatation is permanent secondary to a long-standing disorder of colonic motility. This condition can be congenital, acquired or idiopathic. Congenital megacolon may be caused by genetic abnormalities such as those associated with Hirschsprung's disease or MEN2B. Acquired megacolon is associated with neuropathies, myopathies and connective tissue disease. Idiopathic megacolon are cases of megacolon where no organic cause is found. This patient had chronic, idiopathic megacolon and megarectum. Patients with this condition report recurrent episodes of constipation, abdominal pain, distension and bloating starting in childhood or adolescence. Due to increased intraluminal pressures, these patients are at an increased risk of ulceration of the bowel wall. Hence, they are at an increased risk of perforation. The literature on managing these patients is not consistent and, thus, these patients present a serious management challenge to surgeons.

For most patients with chronic megacolon and constipation, a non-surgical approach can be effective. This includes high colonic water enemas, water-soluble contrast enemas and oral polyethylene glycol-based solutions. If these methods succeed, patients can be discharged with dietary advice and a regular colonic regime. However, if these methods fail, it is important to consider early surgical therapy. This includes colectomy with ileoanal anastomosis in those with normal anorectal function and a diverting loop ileostomy in patients with abnormal anorectal function. This is associated with good outcomes in the majority of patients.

In this case, an earlier appreciation during a previous admission that this was a rare presentation of chronic idiopathic megacolon and megarectum may have prevented the perforation and elective surgery could have been planned.

### CT colonography features of sigmoid diverticular disease [^112tjeUN]. Clinical Imaging (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of this study is to assess the sigmoid distensibility during CT colonography (CTC) in patients with diverticular disease.

Methods

Consecutive patients without a history of pelvic radiation or neoplasms underwent 150 CTC. Three radiologists in consensus evaluated axial images for colonic distention, luminal diameters (mm), diverticula, and muscular thickening.

Results

The minimum colon diameter in patients with muscular thickening was significantly smaller, irrespective of the presence of diverticula (P = 0.009).

Conclusion

Muscular thickening with diverticular disease was associated with significantly less sigmoid colon distension.

Discussion

Limitations of the study

Although the shape of the colon was considered to be reasonably realistic, it is not representative of the full range of human colons because of the large natural variation of colonic anatomy in vivo.

The artificial mesentery constraints were placed in anatomically realistic positions, but were unrealistic in that they were discrete rather than a continuous membrane. The forces measured by the load cells were reduced by the friction of the colon on the base and of the cord on the guide. A large fraction of the forces acting on the devices came from the fixed walls of the simulated abdominal cavity, where they could not be measured. For these reasons, we acknowledge that the results may not accurately reflect loads on real mesenteries. Nonetheless, they should allow a reasonable comparison between devices.

Our CC insertion time of 4.9 ± 3.3 min was somewhat shorter, but not significantly different from reported mean clinical times of 6.9 ± 4.2 min (p = 0.2). The insufflation pressures used during CC insertion (mean 1.52 kPa) were also low, but within the reported range of clinical values of 1.1–7.6 kPa (mean 3.0 kPa). The lack of resistance from adjacent anatomical structures may have reduced the pressures required to distend the colon. The similarity of these values to clinical times indicates that the test bed was reasonably realistic.

The colon used was an ex vivo porcine colon. Porcine colon is considered to be morphologically and physiologically similar to human colon, but it has a different anatomical layout. The porcine colon had a diameter comparable to sections of human colon, and is a reasonable and far more accessible alterative to in vivo testing. Alternatives such as Thiel-embalmed colon and artificial phantoms were considered to be unsuitable due to their less realistic mechanical and friction characteristics.

The number of test replicates was low (two colons, each with three replicates per device). This was due to the complexity of setting up the test bed and experimental apparatus with fresh colon tissue. Additionally, it was only possible to have a limited number of replicates in each colon due to the fact that the porcine colons tended to deteriorate or ultimately rupture after prolonged testing, limiting their effective lifetimes. We accounted for the low number of colon specimens in our statistical analysis by including the colon as a covariate in an analysis of covariance. While this testing was sufficient for an initial feasibility study, further testing would be required to reliably prove the safety and efficacy of the device.

### Acute colonic pseudo-obstruction [^111ra2uc]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

Acute colonic pseudo-obstruction (ACPO) is a syndrome of massive dilation of the colon without mechanical obstruction that develops in hospitalized patients with serious underlying medical and surgical conditions. Increasing age, cecal diameter, delay in decompression, and status of the bowel significantly influence mortality, which is approximately 40% when ischemia or perforation is present. Evaluation of the markedly distended colon involves excluding mechanical obstruction and other causes of toxic megacolon such as Clostridium difficile infection and assessing for signs of ischemia and perforation. The risk of colonic perforation in ACPO increases when cecal diameter exceeds 12 cm and when the distention has been present for greater than 6 days. Appropriate management includes supportive therapy and selective use of neostigmine and colonoscopy for decompression. Early recognition and management are critical in minimizing complications.

### Acute colonic pseudo-obstruction: defining the epidemiology, treatment, and adverse outcomes of ogilvie's syndrome [^113SNq62]. The American Surgeon (2016). Low credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on acute colonic pseudo-obstruction:

- **Definition**: ACPO is a syndrome of massive dilation of the colon without mechanical obstruction and an identifiable cause.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology is not completely understood but is thought to result from an imbalance in the autonomic regulation of colonic motor function. Metabolic or pharmacological factors, as well as spinal or retroperitoneal trauma, may alter the autonomic regulation of colonic function, leading to excessive parasympathetic suppression or sympathetic stimulation. This imbalance results in colonic atony and dilation.
- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of ACPO is estimated at 100 cases per 100,000 admissions.
- **Disease course**: Clinically, it presents as a syndrome of massive dilation of the colon without mechanical obstruction. The condition can lead to significant complications, including ischemia and perforation.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis is serious, with significant morbidity and mortality. Complications such as ischemia or perforation can occur, particularly when the cecal diameter exceeds 12 cm and when the distention has been present for > 6 days. The mortality rate is estimated at 40% when these complications occur.

Multidisciplinary team involvement with gastroenterologist, colorectal surgeon, and stoma therapist enables better management. Surgical input at an early stage helps patients to understand that colectomy is an important treatment option and is not an outcome to be avoided at any cost. Prompt joint decision-making is essential to avoid unnecessary delays (figure 2).

3.13 Surgical management in UC

3.13.1 Emergency colectomy for UC

Surgery in ASUC is indicated when the disease is medically resistant, there are intolerable side effects of medication, or when there is life-threatening haemorrhage, toxic megacolon or perforation. Toxic megacolon is a devastating complication of severe colitis, characterised by radiographic distension of the colon often with fever, tachycardia, neutrophil leucocytosis and anaemia.

In this setting, the operation of choice is a subtotal colectomy and end ileostomy with long rectal stump. This could be performed laparoscopically or open according to local expertise, although a laparoscopic approach is likely to result in shorter length of stay and reduced risk of infectious complications.

Care should be taken to avoid leakage from the rectosigmoid stump, either by formation of mucous fistula, locating the top of the remnant in the subcutaneous tissue of the abdominal wall, or closing the stump but leaving a transanal catheter in the initial postoperative period to prevent stump 'blow-out', with no clear evidence of the preferred technique. If the patient wishes to consider restoration of intestinal continuity with a proctectomy and ileoanal pouch, this should not be undertaken in the acute setting, given the significant risk of complications in a patient who is likely to be clinically unwell, hypoalbuminaemic and on immunosuppressive medication. Timing of pouch surgery should be an individualised decision with multidisciplinary input, with a minimum of 3 months and preferably 6 months from the initial subtotal colectomy in order that adhesions may be safely manageable and the patient allowed time to generally recover from the initial procedure. A population cohort study from Sweden showed that the median time to subsequent reconstructive surgery is almost 12 months. At the time of ileoanal pouch surgery, a temporary covering loop ileostomy will reduce the clinical anastomotic leak rate as well as the septic sequelae of a leak, but may be omitted in optimal circumstances. A subsequent anastomotic leak from a non-defunctioned ileal pouch-anal anastomosis would generally require defunctioning.

### Assessing colonic anatomy normal values based on air contrast enemas in children younger than 6 years [^112GBynh]. Pediatric Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

We found that the diameter ratios of the rectum and the ascending colon (compared with the width of vertebral body of L2) increase with age. This is also reflected in the results of the ratios comparing different colonic segment diameters with one another; the majority of ratios involving the rectum or ascending colon diameter differed significantly among age groups. However for the sigmoid, descending and transverse colon segments, the ratios compared to the width of the vertebral body of L2 did not change significantly with age, and the same is true for the ratios comparing these segments with one another. The cause of the age-related increase in diameter of the rectum and the ascending colon cannot be determined based on our results, but this could be related to factors of childhood development. For instance, with aging and the acquisition of toileting skills, the child learns to voluntarily retain stools. At the same time, the defecation frequency and stool consistency change over time, from frequent, soft stools as an infant to less frequent, formed stools as a toddler. These factors might explain the increased rectal diameter because a higher rectal volume might lead to distension of this segment. The ascending colonic diameter also increases with age. This might be related to ingestion of larger volumes of solid food, which then reach the ascending colon where transit of solids can be delayed, causing the ascending colon to function as a temporary storage and subjecting it to distension by its luminal contents. Another factor that could play a role in distension of the ascending colon is that children spend more time in the upright position as they get older; this potentially results in fluid fecal material moving back into the ascending colon by gravity, thereby increasing the volume of this colonic segment, which might lead to distension. However, these are hypotheses that would need to be further investigated to provide better insights into the physiological development of the pediatric colon.

### American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy guideline on the role of endoscopy in the management of acute colonic pseudo-obstruction and colonic volvulus [^111eanHc]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2020). High credibility.

Acute colonic pseudo-obstruction (ACPO) — conservative management — In patients with uncomplicated ACPO (absence of ischemia, peritonitis, cecal diameter > 12 cm, and/or significant abdominal pain), conservative management remains first-line therapy and includes identification and discontinuation of predisposing factors, correction of fluid and electrolyte disorders, maintaining patient with nothing by mouth, ambulation, treatment of infections, and decompression of the proximal gut with a nasogastric tube; overall success is variable with rates ranging from 77% to 96%, and serial assessment of cecal diameter is prudent given the risk of perforation with cecal diameters greater than 12 cm; for patients not candidates for conservative management or with symptoms persisting beyond 48 to 72 hours, either pharmacologic therapy or endoscopic decompression should be considered, with one retrospective study finding colonic decompression more effective initially than neostigmine but without decreases in hospital stay, intensive care unit stay, or need for colectomy.
