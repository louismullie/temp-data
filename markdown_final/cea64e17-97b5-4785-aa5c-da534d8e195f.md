## Question

Rubbery dry feeling oral mucosa

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about a patient describing a "rubbery, dry" feeling of the oral mucosa. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what the symptom implies pathophysiologically and how to distinguish subjective xerostomia from objective hyposalivation. Then, I should verify the differential diagnosis, including local, systemic, medication-related, and sensory neuropathic causes. Next, I will outline a focused history and examination strategy, followed by targeted diagnostic testing. After that, I need to consider initial management by etiology, including saliva stimulation, substitutes, and oral care, and finally, I should confirm red flags, follow-up, and when to refer or biopsy, making sure each step aligns with current guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the clinical construct: a "rubbery, dry" oral sensation most closely maps to xerostomia, the subjective complaint of oral dryness, which may or may not reflect objective salivary gland hypofunction, and this distinction is foundational because management differs if the glands have residual secretory capacity versus not [^115qKhDB] [^115dHJKN].

> Wait, let me verify the pathophysiology before jumping to causes. Reduced salivary flow alters mucosal lubrication, increases friction, and can change mucosal texture and feel, while qualitative changes in saliva composition can also contribute to discomfort even when stimulated flow is near-normal. Importantly, patient-reported dryness correlates poorly with objective measures, so I should not assume hyposalivation from symptoms alone [^1179oJU4] [^111owUTk].

> I will now examine medication-induced causes because they are the most common in general practice. Anticholinergics, opioids, benzodiazepines, antidepressants, and many others reduce salivary flow; in advanced illness and oncology settings, anticholinergic load is common and often unavoidable, so I need to reconcile the medication list, timing of symptom onset, and dose changes before attributing causality [^111gib15] [^114QqgHP].

> Hold on, I should verify autoimmune etiologies next, especially Sjögren's disease, which classically presents with sicca symptoms and may include salivary gland swelling or extraglandular features. Screening questions for dry eyes, parotid swelling, and systemic features, plus serologies (ANA, SSA/Ro, SSB/La, RF), and, when indicated, salivary gland ultrasound or minor salivary gland biopsy, are appropriate next steps if clinical suspicion is high [^112Sz5e6] [^111RLHh1].

> Let me consider iatrogenic causes from cancer therapy because they are common and mechanistically distinct. Head and neck radiotherapy frequently causes permanent salivary hypofunction, while immune checkpoint inhibitors can cause xerostomia as an irAE, sometimes with a sensory disturbance phenotype rather than true hyposalivation; onset after starting ICIs, association with other irAEs, and incomplete resolution after drug cessation should be kept in mind [^111XEx5t] [^111Xao6N] [^116qKE6B].

> But wait, what if the mucosa looks normal and the "dryness" is actually a neuropathic sensation. Burning mouth syndrome presents with oral burning or dysesthesias, often with a dry mouth sensation, in the absence of clinical or laboratory abnormalities; it is a diagnosis of exclusion and may respond to topical or psychological therapies, though evidence quality is limited and heterogeneous [^1144huw6] [^112vB4S6].

> Next, I should review other systemic contributors so I don't miss reversible causes. Dehydration, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and menopause can all contribute to xerostomia; in menopause, estrogen-related salivary changes and polypharmacy are frequent, and symptom–objective discordance is common, so I need to ask about systemic dryness elsewhere and hormonal history [^115pE7M2] [^111HShD7].

> I need to ensure I'm not overlooking local oral conditions that mimic dryness or coexist with it. Oral candidiasis, lichen planus, and chronic graft-versus-host disease can present with burning, altered mucosal feel, and secondary dryness; I should inspect carefully for erythematous atrophic candidiasis, Wickham's striae, erosions, and fibrosis, and remember that xerostomia increases candida risk, so a low threshold for antifungal therapy is reasonable when clinical clues are present [^114t53bk] [^114B8tRc].

> Let me first confirm the focused history elements I must elicit: onset and chronicity, diurnal pattern, associated burning or taste changes, sicca symptoms, systemic features, medication and supplement use including OTCs, hydration status, cancer treatment history, and psychosocial factors such as anxiety or sleep disturbance. I should also ask about oral care products and habits that may irritate or desiccate the mucosa, including alcohol-containing rinses and acidic candies [^115qKhDB] [^114QqgHP].

> Next, I should review the examination strategy. A thorough oral exam includes mucosal moisture, pooling or frothy saliva, mirror stickiness, tongue papillae, candidal signs, mucosal erythema or lichenoid changes, and denture fit if applicable. Extraoral palpation of major salivary glands and a focused head and neck exam complete the assessment, and I should document baseline findings for future comparison [^114B8tRc] [^114QsCE3].

> Hold on, I should verify when to order tests and which ones are most informative. If Sjögren's is suspected, SSA/Ro, SSB/La, ANA, and RF are appropriate, with salivary gland ultrasound or biopsy as indicated. If objective salivary function is needed, unstimulated whole saliva collection or salivary scintigraphy can be considered. In cancer patients, distinguishing true hyposalivation from sensory xerostomia guides whether to prioritize sialagogues versus sensory-directed strategies [^116RVwec] [^111owUTk].

> I will now examine initial management principles, starting with saliva stimulation when residual capacity exists. Sugar-free gum or lozenges, xylitol products, and gustatory stimulation are low-risk and often helpful; pharmacologic sialagogues such as pilocarpine or cevimeline are appropriate for persistent symptoms, with counseling on sweating and GI effects and contraindications in narrow-angle glaucoma or uncontrolled asthma; pilocarpine is FDA-approved for radiation-induced xerostomia and Sjögren's-related dry mouth, which supports its use in those phenotypes [^116gi1CZ] [^115naLDg].

> Let me consider saliva substitutes and mucosal care when stimulation is insufficient or contraindicated. Neutral pH, alcohol-free formulations with fluoride are preferred; oxygenated glycerol triester sprays show modest superiority to electrolyte sprays in some trials, and lanolin-based lip lubricants help with concomitant lip dryness; I should avoid acidic products and glycerol-lemon rinses that can demineralize teeth and worsen discomfort in salivary hypofunction [^1136D6fw] [^114Tqi96] [^114B8tRc].

> I need to ensure oral health risks are addressed proactively. High-concentration fluoride toothpaste or gels, regular dental care every 3–6 months, and caries prevention protocols are essential in xerostomia. If candidiasis is suspected clinically, treat with topical antifungals and reassess, recognizing recurrence risk if salivary dysfunction persists. For burning mouth syndrome, topical clonazepam rinses, capsaicin, and psychological therapies may be considered, acknowledging low-quality but supportive evidence [^116gi1CZ] [^114t53bk] [^112vB4S6].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost recommended lemon drops or vitamin C lozenges to stimulate flow; hold on, I should verify best practices. In patients with salivary hypofunction, acidic candies and vitamin C tablets can cause demineralization and mucosal irritation, so I should avoid them and instead favor non-acidic, sugar-free options and structured oral care plans [^114Tqi96].

> Next, I should review red flags and follow-up. Persistent symptoms beyond 2–4 weeks despite conservative measures, objective salivary hypofunction, systemic features suggesting autoimmune disease, nonresolving oral lesions, or significant functional impact warrant referral to oral medicine, dentistry, or rheumatology. Any nonhealing, ulcerated, speckled, or erythroplakic lesion should be biopsied or referred urgently to exclude potentially malignant disease [^111CSgkm] [^1134RKij].

> Finally, I should double-check that my plan aligns with guideline-based care and patient-centered goals. Management should be iterative, reassessing symptom control, tolerability, adherence, and oral complications at each visit; in cancer and palliative settings, shared decision-making about medication adjustments, realistic expectations, and prioritizing function and comfort are critical, and I should document measurable outcomes where possible to guide therapy adjustments over time [^116gi1CZ] [^111gDih2].

A "rubbery, dry" oral mucosa most often reflects **xerostomia** [^114t53bk] from salivary hypofunction [^115qKhDB] or a sensory neuropathy [^111owUTk], with common causes including medications (anticholinergics, antidepressants, opioids), Sjögren's syndrome [^116RVwec], head/neck radiotherapy [^111XEx5t], dehydration, or anxiety. Evaluation should include a focused history, oral exam, and salivary flow measurement [^1161p5ow]; consider autoimmune serology, imaging, or biopsy if indicated [^116RVwec]. Management centers on **saliva stimulation** (sugar-free gum/lozenges, pilocarpine/cevimeline) [^115naLDg] [^114hHsyL], saliva substitutes [^113MMdMk], hydration, and oral care to prevent caries and candidiasis [^112ioV9W]; address underlying causes when possible [^117JqsLM]. Persistent or atypical cases warrant referral to oral medicine or rheumatology [^112ioV9W].

## Clinical features and patient descriptions

Patients with a rubbery, dry oral mucosa may report:

- **Dryness**: Persistent dryness, difficulty swallowing dry foods, frequent sips of water [^114t53bk].
- **Texture**: A rubbery or sticky sensation, often with frothy or thick saliva [^115dHJKN].
- **Associated symptoms**: Taste disturbances, halitosis, oral burning, mucosal sensitivity, and difficulty speaking or chewing [^114t53bk].

---

## Etiological factors

Several factors contribute to a rubbery, dry oral mucosa, including:

| **Category** | **Etiological factors** |
|-|-|
| Medications | - Anticholinergics <br/> - Antidepressants <br/> - Antihistamines <br/> - Opioids <br/> - Diuretics <br/> - Chemotherapy <br/> - Radiation therapy [^114t53bk] [^111XEx5t] |
| Systemic diseases | - Sjögren's syndrome <br/> - Diabetes mellitus <br/> - HIV/AIDS <br/> - Hepatitis C <br/> - Sarcoidosis <br/> - IgG4-related disease [^116RVwec] [^111RLHh1] |
| Local factors | - Chronic mouth breathing <br/> - Dehydration <br/> - Smoking <br/> - Alcohol use <br/> - Poor oral hygiene [^notfound] |
| Psychological factors | - Anxiety <br/> - Depression <br/> - Stress-related xerostomia [^notfound] |

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms

The rubbery, dry sensation arises from **reduced salivary flow** (hyposalivation) or altered saliva composition, leading to increased friction, mucosal dryness, and a sticky or rubbery feel [^112SXUnU]. Saliva normally lubricates, facilitates speech and swallowing, and provides antimicrobial protection; its loss or alteration compromises these functions [^116sbmeP].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

A comprehensive evaluation includes:

- **History**: Medication use, systemic symptoms, hydration status, and psychological factors [^113usKT6].
- **Clinical examination**: Oral mucosa, salivary glands, and dentition [^114QsCE3].
- **Salivary flow measurement**: Unstimulated and stimulated whole saliva flow rates [^111JhNqN].
- **Laboratory tests**: Autoimmune serology (ANA, SSA/SSB), glucose, CBC, and viral hepatitis panels [^111PLorJ].
- **Imaging**: Salivary gland ultrasound or MRI if structural disease is suspected [^116RVwec].
- **Biopsy**: Minor salivary gland biopsy for suspected Sjögren's syndrome [^116RVwec].

---

## Management strategies

Management focuses on symptom relief, underlying cause treatment, and complication prevention:

- **Saliva stimulation**: Sugar-free gum/lozenges, pilocarpine, cevimeline [^115naLDg] [^114hHsyL].
- **Saliva substitutes**: Mucin-based sprays, gels, or rinses [^114QqgHP].
- **Hydration**: Adequate fluid intake, humidified environment [^117JqsLM].
- **Oral care**: Regular dental visits, fluoride products, antifungal prophylaxis [^112ioV9W].
- **Medication adjustment**: Reduce or substitute xerogenic drugs when possible [^117JqsLM].
- **Address underlying conditions**: Immunotherapy for Sjögren's, diabetes control, infection treatment [^113MMrun].

---

## Potential complications

Untreated xerostomia can lead to:

- **Dental caries**: Rapid progression ("rampant caries") [^notfound].
- **Oral candidiasis**: Increased risk of fungal infection [^114t53bk].
- **Periodontal disease**: Gingival inflammation and tooth loss [^115pE7M2].
- **Dysphagia**: Difficulty swallowing and nutritional compromise [^114t53bk].
- **Quality of life**: Significant impairment due to pain, discomfort, and functional limitations [^114t53bk].

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis depends on the underlying cause and treatment response. Drug-induced xerostomia may improve with medication changes, whereas radiation-induced xerostomia is often persistent and requires ongoing management [^114QqgHP] [^116sbmeP]. Sjögren's-related xerostomia is chronic but can be controlled with **multimodal therapy** [^116RVwec].

---

A rubbery, dry oral mucosa most often reflects xerostomia from salivary hypofunction or sensory neuropathy; a structured approach — history, exam, and targeted tests — guides diagnosis, and management emphasizes **saliva stimulation**, substitutes, hydration, and oral care to prevent complications [^114t53bk].

### Managing a patient with burning mouth syndrome [^112AofHa]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

A 64-year-old woman presented with an increasing frequency of symptoms of heartburn and retrosternal pain over the last few months, and a constant and intense burning pain affecting her tongue tip, mouth and lips for the past 5years. She found consuming hot drinks exacerbated the burning oral pain and chewing gum seemed to alleviate some of her symptoms. She thought these oral sensations were caused by frequently licking her finger tips to separate prints in her work in publishing. She had been previously diagnosed with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD), and her heartburn symptoms had been controlled until recently with lansoprazole 15mg daily. Her past medical history included irritable bowel syndrome and depression, for which she had been treated with mebeverine and paroxetine for a number of years. She was a non-smoker and did not consume alcohol. Clinical examination was unremarkable with no oral lesions on examination. Her routine laboratory tests, including autoimmune serology, haematinics and thyroid function tests were all within normal limits. She underwent a gastroscopy, which revealed moderate reflux oesophagitis, and following commencing omeprazole 20mg twice daily, her heartburn resolved. However, her oral burning symptoms were not affected and a diagnosis of burning mouth syndrome (BMS) was made. Following explanation and reassurance concerning the cause of her BMS symptoms, she chose not to receive treatment for this but to access cognitive behavioural therapy in the future if her symptoms worsened.

### Interventions for treating burning mouth syndrome [^112vB4S6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Burning mouth syndrome (BMS) is a term used for oral mucosal pain (burning pain or discomfort in the tongue, lips or entire oral cavity) without identifiable cause. General population prevalence varies from 0.1% to 3.9%. Many BMS patients indicate anxiety, depression, personality disorders and impaired quality of life (QoL). This review updates the previous versions published in 2000 and 2005.

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness and safety of any intervention versus placebo for symptom relief and changes in QoL, taste, and feeling of dryness in people with BMS.

Search Methods

Cochrane Oral Health's Information Specialist searched the following databases: Cochrane Oral Health's Trials Register (to 31 December 2015), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2015, Issue 11) in the Cochrane Library (searched 31 December 2015), MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 31 December 2015), and Embase Ovid (1980 to 31 December 2015). We searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform for ongoing trials. We placed no restrictions on the language or date of publication when searching the electronic databases SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing any treatment against placebo in people with BMS. The primary outcomes were symptom relief (pain/burning) and change in QoL. Secondary outcomes included change in taste, feeling of dryness, and adverse effects.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Outcome data were analysed as short-term (up to three months) or long-term (three to six months).

Main Results

We included 23 RCTs (1121 analysed participants; 83% female). Interventions were categorised as: antidepressants and antipsychotics, anticonvulsants, benzodiazepines, cholinergics, dietary supplements, electromagnetic radiation, physical barriers, psychological therapies, and topical treatments. Only one RCT was assessed at low risk of bias overall, four RCTs' risk of bias was unclear, and 18 studies were at high risk of bias. Overall quality of the evidence for effectiveness was very low for all interventions and all outcomes. Twenty-one RCTs assessed short-term symptom relief. There is very low-quality evidence of benefit from electromagnetic radiation (one RCT, 58 participants), topical benzodiazepines (two RCTs, 111 participants), physical barriers (one RCT, 50 participants), and anticonvulsants (one RCT, 100 participants). We found insufficient/contradictory evidence regarding the effectiveness of antidepressants, cholinergics, systemic benzodiazepines, dietary supplements or topical treatments. No RCT assessing psychological therapies evaluated short-term symptom relief. Four studies assessed long-term symptom relief. There is very low-quality evidence of a benefit from psychological therapies (one RCT, 30 participants), capsaicin oral rinse (topical treatment) (one RCT, 18 participants), and topical benzodiazepines (one RCT, 66 participants). We found no evidence of a difference for dietary supplements or lactoperoxidase oral rinse. No studies assessing antidepressants, anticonvulsants, cholinergics, electromagnetic radiation or physical barriers evaluated long-term symptom relief. Short-term change in QoL was assessed by seven studies (none long-term). The quality of evidence was very low. A benefit was found for electromagnetic radiation (one RCT, 58 participants), however findings were inconclusive for antidepressants, benzodiazepines, dietary supplements and physical barriers. Secondary outcomes (change in taste and feeling of dryness) were only assessed short-term, and the findings for both were also inconclusive. With regard to adverse effects, there is very low-quality evidence that antidepressants increase dizziness and drowsiness (one RCT, 37 participants), and that alpha lipoic acid increased headache (two RCTs, 118 participants) and gastrointestinal complaints (3 RCTs, 138 participants). We found insufficient/contradictory evidence regarding adverse events for anticonvulsants or benzodiazepines. Adverse events were poorly reported or unreported for cholinergics, electromagnetic radiation, and psychological therapies. No adverse events occurred from physical barriers or topical therapy use.

Authors' Conclusions

Given BMS' potentially disabling nature, the need to identify effective modes of treatment for sufferers is vital. Due to the limited number of clinical trials at low risk of bias, there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of any interventions in managing BMS. Further clinical trials, with improved methodology and standardised outcome sets are required in order to establish which treatments are effective. Future studies are encouraged to assess the role of treatments used in other neuropathic pain conditions and psychological therapies in the treatment of BMS.

Schirmer tests — characteristic thresholds for aqueous tear production include Schirmer I and II with specific cutoffs and measurement conditions. Schirmer I test (without anesthesia) measures both basic and reflex tearing, and less than 5.5 mm of wetting after 5 minutes is diagnostic of aqueous tear deficiency. Schirmer II test (with anesthesia) measures reflex secretion by stimulating nasal mucosa with a cotton-tip applicator, and wetting of less than 15 mm after 2 minutes is considered abnormal.

MASCC/ISOO Clinical Practice Statement — management essentials for oral immune-related adverse events (irAEs) in patients receiving immunotherapy: Oral irAEs include mucosal and gingival conditions, dysgeusia, dysphagia, and xerostomia/hyposalivation, and management is contingent upon symptom severity. For oral mucosal toxicities, topical steroids and immunomodulators are frequently utilized as first-line therapies, with topical anesthetics employed for pain; strategies for dysgeusia primarily focus on symptom management. The statement also provides a guide for oral and dental care for patients undergoing immunotherapy and emphasizes that optimal management practices necessitate collaboration between medical professionals and oral health specialists.

### Chlorhexidine gluconate (sky oral rinse) [^111ct6z4]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

The most common side effects associated with chlohexidine gluconate oral rinses are: 1) an increase in staining of teeth and other oral surfaces; 2) an increase in calculus formation; and 3) an alteration in taste perception; see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS. Oral irritation and local allergy-type symptoms have been spontaneously reported as side effects associated with use of chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse.

The following oral mucosal side effects were reported during placebo-controlled adult clinical trials: aphthous ulcer, grossly obvious gingivitis, trauma, ulceration, erythema, desquamation, coated tongue, keratinization, geographic tongue, mucocele, and short frenum. Each occured at a frequency of less than 1%.

Among post marketing reports, the most frequently reported oral mucosal symptoms associated with chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse are stomatitis, gingivitis, glossitis, ulcer, dry mouth, hypesthesia, glossal edema, and paresthesia.

Minor irritation and superficial desquamation of the oral mucosa have been noted in patients using chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse.

There have been cases of parotid gland swelling and inflammation of the salivary glands (sialadenitis) reported in patients using chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse.

### Secondary syphilis simulating oral hairy leukoplakia [^111kUKCm]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2003). Low credibility.

We describe a case of secondary syphilis of the tongue in which the main clinical presentation of the disease was similar to oral hairy leukoplakia. In a man who was HIV seronegative, the first symptom was a dryness of the throat followed by a feeling of foreign body in the tongue. Lesions were painful without cutaneous manifestations of secondary syphilis. IgM-fluorescent treponemal antibody test and typical serologic parameters promptly led to the diagnosis of secondary syphilis. We initiated an appropriate antibiotic therapy using benzathine penicillin, which induced healing of the tongue lesions. The differential diagnosis of this lesion may include oral squamous carcinoma, leukoplakia, candidosis, lichen planus, and, especially, hairy oral leukoplakia. This case report emphasizes the importance of considering secondary syphilis in the differential diagnosis of hairy oral leukoplakia. Depending on the clinical picture, the possibility of syphilis should not be overlooked in the differential diagnosis of many diseases of the oral mucosa.

### Oral manifestations of COVID-19 – A literature review [^114mb1cY]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2022). Medium credibility.

Initially, it was reported that coronavirus 2019 disease (Covid-19) affects respiratory, gastrointestinal and neurological systems, but the oral, olfactory and integumentary systems are also involved. This review discusses various oral manifestations of Covid-19 reported in the literature along with possible underlying mechanisms. The reported manifestations include taste impairment, oral mucosal changes (petechiae, ulcers, plaque-like lesions, reactivation of herpes simplex virus 1(HSV1), geographical tongue and desquamative gingivitis) and dry mouth. The prominent location for mucosal lesions are tongue, palate and labial mucosa. The exact pathogenesis of these oral symptoms is not known. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) cell receptors are expressed in abundance on oral mucosa allowing severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) to infect them. Gustatory impairment along with olfactory changes is now listed as a symptom of Covid-19 by the World Health Organization, but further research is needed to confirm a link between reported additional oral symptoms and Covid-19. Dental professionals may encounter individuals with Covid-19 and be called upon to identify various oral manifestations of this disease.

Other oral toxicities — rare oral immune-related adverse events (irAEs) including sialadenitis, OLP/OLR, and neuromuscular alterations such as myasthenia gravis (MG) have been reported, and specific recommendations may be added as literature accumulates. Scleroderma was reported as an adverse effect of immunotherapy; early reports did not detail oral involvement, but scleroderma unrelated to immunotherapy manifests in oral tissues with limited elasticity of the lips and tongue, small blood vessel malformations, limited mouth opening, and increased frequency of gingival recession and gingivitis. The clinician should be aware of these oral signs to prevent sequelae of oral fibrosis, and associated conditions include lichenoid reaction and dry mouth.

### What's new in ocular and oral aspects of Sjögren's syndrome and do new treatments work? [^116RVwec]. Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Primary SS (pSS) is a systemic autoimmune disease characterized by lymphocytic infiltration of the exocrine glands leading to glandular dysfunction, resulting in dryness of the eyes, mouth and other mucosal surfaces. Systemic manifestations also occur in the majority of patients. There has been increasing interest in recent years, with a number of publications regarding the classification criteria, diagnostic tools, disease activity, damage, impact and potential treatments. This article reviews recent advances in the diagnosis and treatment of ocular and oral involvement in pSS. Recent stand-out developments include measurement of tear osmolarity as a marker in dry eye disease diagnosis, new devices measuring tear constituents and meibomian gland structure and treatment of its dysfunction. Lip biopsy is still valuable despite emerging evidence of non-invasive diagnostic techniques, notably salivary gland ultrasound.

### Dysphagia and history of vegetative plaques [^112Qz1XV]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Question 3: What feature of this patient's presentation is least expected for her diagnosis?
A. Improvement with corticosteroids
B. Intertriginous involvement
C. Isolated throat involvement
D. Presentation in a 40-year-old woman
E. Mucosal involvement

Answers:
A. Improvement with corticosteroids – Incorrect. First-line therapy for pemphigus vegetans consists of systemic corticosteroids and immunosuppressant agents (ie, rituximab). Without treatment, epidermal barrier function is compromised leading to fluid and protein loss, malnutrition, and secondary infections, which can progress to septic shock. Once treatment is initiated, patients require lifelong monitoring for both disease relapse and detrimental sequelae of prolonged immunosuppressive therapy.
B. Intertriginous involvement – Incorrect. Pemphigus vegetans is distinguished from pemphigus vulgaris by the presence of papillomatous, vegetating plaques in intertriginous surfaces.
C. Isolated throat involvement – Correct. While oral mucosa involvement occurs in 88% of pemphigus vegetans cases, patients seldom present with lesions to one site, and laryngeal involvement is rarely described. Our patient's isolated laryngeal involvement in biopsy-proven pemphigus vegetans demonstrates a unique presentation that requires immediate medical intervention.
D. Presentation in a 40-year-old woman – Incorrect. Pemphigus vegetans predominantly affects middle-aged women.
E. Mucosal involvement – Incorrect. Oral mucosa is almost invariably involved in pemphigus vegetans, hindering oral intake and often compromising patients' nutritional status. Mucosal lesions most commonly involve the buccal mucosa, lips, and gingivae, but can extend to the conjunctiva, pharynx, larynx, esophagus, vagina, penis, and anus.

### Burning mouth syndrome: recognition, understanding, and management [^11767Uc9]. Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Burning mouth syndrome (BMS) can be a frustrating condition to the patient and the practitioner because the patient often experiences a continuous burning pain in the mouth without any apparent clinical signs, but the practitioner is unable to definitively diagnose symptoms even with the use of diagnostic testing or imaging. To overcome this dilemma, it is important for the practitioner to recognize and understand the complexities of BMS. The practitioner can then develop a sound approach to management of this condition and patients can be educated and reassured regarding BMS.

### MASCC / ISOO clinical practice statement: management of oral complications of immunotherapy [^111owUTk]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Xerostomia/hyposalivation

The subjective sensation of dry mouth is termed xerostomia, while the objective state of dry mouth, in which there is low saliva secretion, is termed hyposalivation. The management of xerostomia and hyposalivation is presented in detail in two other OCSG CPSs. The principles of management outlined in these two OCSG CPSs apply to immunotherapy-associated dry mouth.
There is weak evidence to support the hypothesis that dry mouth due to immunotherapy may be reversed or relieved by withholding the offending agent, and possibly with the initiation of steroid therapy.
Xerostomia may not necessarily be associated with the objective signs of dry mouth. This may be due to a qualitative change in the absence of quantitative change. In some cases, the cause of xerostomia may be a sensory disturbance rather than salivary gland dysfunction. Such patients often present xerostomia in combination with a burning sensation, and these patients may benefit from treatment for the oral sensory disturbances.
Xerostomia is a common irAE of cancer treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) and can significantly impair the patient's health-related quality of life. However, Sjögren's like disease in patients taking ICIs is underdiagnosed and can lead to severe systemic manifestations.
Of note, since dry mouth is a risk factor for oral candidiasis, attention should be given to possible co-diagnosis of thrush or erythematous atrophic oral candidiasis.
Sialagogues like pilocarpine or cevimeline may be used to alleviate the symptoms. Additional information about the management of dry mouth is available in the MASCC/ISOO CPS: Management of salivary gland hypofunction and xerostomia in cancer patients.

### A systematic review of salivary gland hypofunction and / or xerostomia induced by non-surgical cancer therapies: prevention strategies [^111ZNoe4]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Following head and neck cancer treatment, salivary gland hypofunction (objective evidence of low salivary flow rate) and xerostomia (subjective feeling of dry mouth) are predictable long-term complications. This is particularly relevant following radiotherapy involving exposure of the major and minor salivary glands. In contrast, salivary gland hypofunction following chemotherapy as well as other cancer treatments such as radioactive iodine treatment and total body irradiation/hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), are less prevalent, often temporary and, where present, less severe. In patients treated with targeted therapies, e.g. immune checkpoint inhibitors, a xerostomia prevalence of 0.4–7% has been reported with or without associated dry eyes. Further studies are warranted to explore this correlation as reported prevalence might be counfonded by polypharmacy and dehydration.

This systematic review represents a search and evaluation of the literature appearing since the previous MASCC/ISOO systematic review conducted in 2010 (MASCC/ISOO) on the prevention of salivary gland hypofunction and xerostomia induced by non-surgical cancer therapies, including literature on the newer checkpoint inhibitors and other biologicals which have now become an integral part of cancer therapies. Data collected in this systematic review of the literature also served as the basis for the ISOO/MASCC/ASCO clinical practice guideline: Salivary Gland Hypofunction and/or Xerostomia Induced by Nonsurgical Cancer Therapies.

### The differential diagnosis of dry eyes, dry mouth, and parotidomegaly: a comprehensive review [^111RLHh1]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2015). Low credibility.

Primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS) is a frequent autoimmune systemic disease, clinically characterized by eyes and mouth dryness in all patients, salivary gland swelling or extraglandular systemic manifestations in half of the patients, and development of lymphoma in 5 to 10% of the patients. However, patients presenting with sicca symptoms or salivary gland swelling may have a variety of conditions that may require very different investigations, treatments, or follow-up. Eye and/or mouth dryness is a frequent complaint in clinical setting, and its frequency increases with age. When evaluating a patient with suspected pSS, the first step is to rule out its differential diagnoses, before looking for positive arguments for the disease. Knowledge of normal and abnormal lachrymal and salivary gland physiology allows the clinician to prescribe the most adapted procedures for evaluating their function and structure. New tests have been developed in recent years for evaluating these patients, notably new ocular surface staining scores or salivary gland ultrasonography. We describe the different diagnoses performed in our monocentric cohort of 240 patients with suspected pSS. The most frequent diagnoses are pSS, other systemic autoimmune diseases, idiopathic sicca syndrome and drug-induced sicca syndrome. However, other diseases are important to rule out due to their specific management, such as sarcoidosis, granulomatosis with polyangeitis, IgG4-related disease, chronic hepatitis C virus or human immunodeficiency virus infections, graft-versus-host disease, and head and neck radiation therapy. At the light of these data, we propose a core of minimal investigations to be performed when evaluating a patient with suspected pSS.

Nikolsky Sign

When encountering a patient with a blistering disease, clinicians may test the positivity of the Nikolsky sign consisting of two variants. The Nikolsky sign I (or direct Nikolsky sign) can be tested by sideward friction of healthy-looking skin or mucosa, and is positive when the mechanical pressure induces an erosion. The Nikolsky sign II (or indirect Nikolsky sign) tests the ability to split the epidermis by pulling the blister remnant, and is positive when the blister extends far beyond the existing erosion.

In patients with a clinical phenotype compatible with AIBD, the Nikolsky sign on the skin may be a useful diagnostic tool with moderate sensitivity; however, a very high specificity for the diagnosis of pemphigus diseases. The Nikolsky sign can also be tested on the gingiva in patients with only oral involvement, however, it is often positive in both MMP and pemphigus, and therefore not a useful tool to differentiate between these diseases. Moreover, the Nikolsky sign on the oral mucosa may cause unnecessary injury to the tissue and pain to the patient.

### Impact of postoperative neck radiotherapy volumes on long-term unstimulated saliva flow following primary surgery and ipsilateral neck dissection for oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma [^115j86DQ]. Head & Neck (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is routinely managed by definitive surgical resection. Postoperative radiotherapy (PORT) ± chemotherapy (POCRT) is considered for those with adverse pathological features to reduce the risk of disease relapse. Both surgery and PORT are associated with acute and late toxicity and many patients experience long‐term salivary gland hypofunction and a sensation of oral dryness (xerostomia) following treatment. This can lead to long‐term complications of salivary hypofunction, including oral infections, dental disease including postradiation caries, dysgeusia, dysphagia, and reduced nutritional state with consequently reduced quality of life.

Clinical discussions around the delivery of adjuvant treatment must balance the expected disease control benefit from PORT against likely treatment‐related morbidity. In some scenarios there may be clinical equipoise when considering PORT and especially the neck volumes to be encompassed depending on pathological findings. A common clinical dilemma is whether or not to treat the clinically N0 contralateral neck in patients with a low likelihood of occult disease.

Sparing the contralateral neck during the delivery of definitive RT for oropharyngeal cancer has been demonstrated to reduce both objectively measured and patient‐reported late xerostomia. There is a paucity of literature quantifying the degree of salivary hypofunction following PORT for OSCC and in particular the relative contributions of initial ipsilateral neck dissection, with likely resection of submandibular salivary glands, and subsequent ipsilateral or bilateral neck PORT. A better understanding of this relationship is of value to guide adjuvant treatment discussions.

We investigate the association of PORT/POCRT delivered to the bilateral or ipsilateral neck and primary site alone on longitudinal unstimulated salivary function in OSCC following primary resection and ipsilateral neck dissection.

### Zenker's diverticulum: a rare clinical condition with unusual oral manifestation [^114ssuMb]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

Oral mucosa exhibit clinical manifestations of a variety of systemic conditions and can serve as an indicator of overall health of an individual. Various systemic conditions like autoimmune, endocrine and haematological disorders can present with oral mucosal lesions, which can serve as an important diagnostic feature. These oral lesions can vary from oral ulceration, bleeding gums, xerostomia, chronic glossitis, to erosion and sensitivity of teeth. It is important that a clinician must be aware of the oral presentations of systemic conditions, so that timely diagnosis can be made and the necessary treatment is executed. This paper presents an unusual case of severe oral mucosal ulcerations and dysphagia in an elderly patient diagnosed with Zenker's diverticulum. Patient was relieved of all oral symptoms once the underlying gastrointestinal tract pathology was diagnosed and surgically corrected.

### Discrepancy between subjective symptoms, objective measures and disease activity indexes: the lesson of primary Sjögren's syndrome [^1179oJU4]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

Mucosal dryness is a key clinical feature in primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS) and its assessment relies on both objective measurement of residual secretion and subjective symptoms reported by patients. However, while the objective assessment and grading of glandular dysfunction can be easily performed, the spectrum of clinical symptoms encompassed by the terms 'dry eye' and 'dry mouth' is wide and heterogeneous. Therefore, patient reported outcomes (PROs) for dryness in pSS poorly correlate with the amount of glandular secretion. In addition, subjective dryness is not correlated with the severity of systemic disease and severely affects the patient quality of life even in presence of active extraglandular manifestations. The purpose of this review article is to provide an overview of glandular dysfunction in pSS as well as the impact of discrepancy between objective assessment, subjective symptom and extraglandular disease activity on disease management.

### MASCC / ISOO clinical practice statement: management of salivary gland hypofunction and xerostomia in cancer patients [^116gi1CZ]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2024). High credibility.

Management of salivary gland hypofunction and xerostomia in cancer patients — Treatment goals are to relieve symptoms by stimulating saliva production of salivary glands with residual secretory capacity or by artificial wetting of the oral and lip surfaces. Whenever possible, stimulating saliva production should be considered the primary approach because it helps to preserve salivary gland function, and saliva provides additional benefits such as anti-microbial properties, whereas wetting agents only serve to artificially lubricate the affected surfaces. This is commonly achieved by pharmacological (Table 1) or non-pharmacological interventions (Table 2). Other topical agents investigated in non-cancer patients, including pilocarpine, anticholinesterase physostigmine, 1% malic acid, oxygenated glycerol triester spray, and a mucoadhesive lipid-based bioerodable tablet containing lubricating agents, may provide symptomatic relief, and clinicians should periodically review the literature for updated information. If appropriate, a review and adjustment of the patient's concomitant medications (number, dosage, formulation) may be explored; for cancer patients, opioids and anti-cholinergic agents are common culprits for causing dry mouth. Post-head and neck radiation patients and those with oral chronic graft-versus-host disease may suffer from mucosal sensitivity, and thus alcohol-free oral agents with neutral pH and bland or non-mint taste are preferred.

### MASCC / ISOO expert opinion on the management of oral problems in patients with advanced cancer [^117JqsLM]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2022). High credibility.

Xerostomia/salivary gland hypofunction management should include treatment of the underlying cause (if possible), e.g., discontinuation of offending medication (Category of guideline — suggestion: Level of evidence — V), and symptomatic management involves both non-pharmacological and pharmacological interventions. Non-pharmacological interventions include water, artificial saliva (Category of guideline — recommendation: Level of evidence — II, i.e. mucin-based artificial saliva), chewing gum (Category of guideline — recommendation: Level of evidence — II) and acupuncture (No guideline possible). Artificial salivas tend to have a longer duration of action than water, and ideally an artificial saliva should have a neutral pH and contain fluoride; when the salivary glands can be stimulated, saliva stimulants (e.g., sugar-free chewing gum, pilocarpine) are generally preferable to saliva substitutes (e.g., water, artificial salivas) since they are more effective in relieving xerostomia and should improve other problems associated with salivary gland hypofunction. Pharmacological interventions include pilocarpine (Category of guideline — recommendation: Level of evidence — II), and the evidence on managing xerostomia/salivary gland hypofunction per se is of limited quality.

### Palliative care assessment of dry mouth: what matters most to patients with advanced disease? [^111gib15]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

Drug treatment is the most common cause of dry mouth in the general population. Patients with advanced diseases are often prescribed a large number of medications, many of which have recognised anticholinergic effects, such as opioids, corticosteroids and benzodiazepines, and cannot be discontinued due to refractory symptomatology. 'Anticholinergic load' has been recently studied in a retrospective review of patients with advanced diseases at the end of life. In 199 patients, 60% received anticholinergic medication in the last 72 h of life.

There are few treatments licenced for use to help this condition. A systematic literature review on the management of dry mouth in advanced cancer patients identified only three randomised controlled trials and three prospective studies. Overall, randomised controlled trials support the use of pilocarpine, artificial saliva and chewing gum for the management of xerostomia. However, the evidence is of low quality.

Dry mouth in patients with advanced progressive diseases is a poorly understood area of research. Studies reporting on the assessment of dry mouth and outcomes of interventions have used varying scales and tools. Some researchers used additional symptoms other than dry mouth such as dysphagia, dysgeusia and dysarthria. Secondary outcomes have included the use of additional questionnaires relating to overall opinion and preference to continue treatment. A more recent study has used validated tools from non-palliative care populations. The Memorial symptom assessment scale (MSAS) and the Edmonton symptom assessment scale (ESAS) are validated symptom assessment tools commonly used in the palliative care population, but they are not specific for dry mouth. There is no consensus on the most valid approach that also incorporates the functional impact on the patient. To our knowledge, there is no validated dry mouth assessment tool for the palliative care patient.

Management

Currently, the treatment goals of managing salivary gland hypofunction and xerostomia in cancer patients are to relieve symptoms by the following: i) Stimulating saliva production of salivary glands with residual secretory capacity ii) Artificial wetting of the oral and lip surfaces Whenever possible, stimulating saliva production should be considered the primary approach because it helps to preserve salivary gland function. Aside from alleviating xerostomia, saliva provides additional benefits such as anti-microbial properties, whereas wetting agents only serve to artificially lubricate the affected surfaces.

This is commonly achieved by pharmacological (Table 1) or non-pharmacological interventions (Table 2). The interventions in Tables 1 and 2 are not an exhaustive list of those being used in clinical practice.
Other than traditional Chinese herbal remedies that have been studied in cancer patients, there are topical agents that have been investigated in non-cancer patients (e.g. pilocarpine, anticholinesterase physostigmine, 1% malic acid, oxygenated glycerol triester spray, mucoadhesive lipid-based bioerodable tablet containing lubricating agents) that may provide symptomatic relief to cancer patients with salivary gland hypofunction or xerostomia. Clinicians should periodically review the literature for updated information.
If appropriate, a review and adjustment of the patient's concomitant medications (i.e. number, dosage, formulation) to alleviate salivary gland hypofunction or xerostomia may be explored. For cancer patients, opioids and anti-cholinergic agents are common culprits for causing dry mouth.
Post-head and neck radiation patients and those with oral chronic graft-versus-host disease may suffer from mucosal sensitivity. The symptoms may be aggravated in individuals with salivary gland hypofunction due to lack of lubrication and excessive friction during oral physiologic function. Thus, alcohol-free oral agents with neutral pH and bland or non-mint taste are preferred.
Dry, cracked, and painful lips often accompany signs and symptoms in cancer patients with salivary gland hypofunction. Application of lanolin-based or wax-based lip lubricant may help relieve this complaint.
Patients with salivary gland hypofunction are at risk for opportunistic oral candidiasis. Antifungal therapy should be initiated when there are clinical signs of oral candidiasis, and considered when there are non-specific symptoms suggesting subclinical infection.
Patients with salivary gland hypofunction are at increased risk for dental caries. As such, all patients should have regular professional dental care two to four times a year. They should also incorporate high-concentration, pH-neutral fluoride products into their daily oral hygiene routine and avoid highly cariogenic and acidic foods in their diet.
Patients may benefit from avoidance of oral care products with sodium lauryl sulfate and intense flavors as well as acidic or spicy foods as they may aggravate the discomfort associated with salivary gland hypofunction or xerostomia.
There is emerging literature to suggest that head and neck cancer patients are at a higher risk for sleep apnea. Salivary gland hypofunction or xerostomia may compromise the treatment of sleep apnea. Clinicians can consider the use of nocturnal mouth moistening strategies for such patients.
Advanced radiation techniques such as intensity-modulated radiation therapy, radioprotectors (e.g. amifostine), pilocarpine or bethanechol administration before and during radiation therapy, surgical transfer of submandibular gland and acupuncture have shown mixed findings or weak evidence for the prevention of salivary gland hypofunction.

Supportive oral health measures and referrals — supportive and preventive oral health measures should be promoted to reduce the risk of side effects from oncologic treatment; although there is no curative intervention, the clinician should be confident in discussing with the patient fluoride prescription in dentate individuals and topical management that may ameliorate xerostomia and its related complaints; for further management, referral to a specialist Oral Medicine Unit or a dentist trained in the specific care these patients need should be considered, with attention to potential adverse impacts of xerostomia and salivary gland hypofunction and referral to appropriate ancillary services when indicated.

### Interventions for the management of dry mouth: non-pharmacological interventions [^111JhNqN]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Xerostomia is the subjective sensation of dry mouth. Common causes of xerostomia include adverse effects of many commonly prescribed medications, disease (e.g. Sjogren's Syndrome) and radiotherapy treatment for head and neck cancers. Non-pharmacological techniques such as acupuncture or mild electrostimulation may be used to improve symptoms.

Objectives

To assess the effects of non-pharmacological interventions administered to stimulate saliva production for the relief of dry mouth.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register (to 16th April 2013), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2013, Issue 3), MEDLINE via OVID (1948 to 16th April 2013), EMBASE via OVID (1980 to 16th April 2013), AMED via OVID (1985 to 16th April 2013), CINAHL via EBSCO (1981 to 16th April 2013), and CANCERLIT via PubMed (1950 to 16th April 2013). The metaRegister of Controlled Clinical Trials (www.controlled-trials.com) and ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov) were also searched to identify ongoing and completed trials. References lists of included studies and relevant reviews were also searched. There were no restrictions on the language of publication or publication status.

Selection Criteria

We included parallel group randomised controlled trials of non-pharmacological interventions to treat dry mouth, where participants had dry mouth symptoms at baseline.

Data Collection and Analysis

At least two review authors assessed each of the included studies to confirm eligibility, assess risk of bias and extract data using a piloted data extraction form. We calculated mean difference (MD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for continuous outcomes or where different scales were used to assess an outcome, we calculated standardised mean differences (SMD) together with 95% CIs. We attempted to extract data on adverse effects of interventions. Where data were missing or unclear we attempted to contact study authors to obtain further information.

Main Results

There were nine studies (total 366 participants randomised) included in this review of non-pharmacological interventions for dry mouth which were divided into three comparisons. Eight studies were assessed at high risk of bias in at least one domain and the remaining study was at unclear risk of bias. Five small studies (total 153 participants, with dry mouth following radiotherapy treatment) compared acupuncture with placebo. Four were assessed at high risk and one at unclear risk of bias. Two trials reported outcome data for dry mouth in a form suitable for meta-analysis. The pooled estimate of these two trials (70 participants, low quality evidence) showed no difference between acupuncture and control in dry mouth symptoms (SMD -0.34, 95% CI -0.81 to 0.14, P value 0.17, I(2) = 39%) with the confidence intervals including both a possible reduction or a possible increase in dry mouth symptoms. Acupuncture was associated with more adverse effects (tiny bruises and tiredness which were mild and temporary). There was a very small increase in unstimulated whole saliva (UWS) at the end of 4 to 6 weeks of treatment (three trials, 71 participants, low quality evidence) (MD 0.02 ml/minute, 95% CI 0 to 0.04, P value 0.04, I(2) = 57%), and this benefit persisted at the 12-month follow-up evaluation (two trials, 54 participants, low quality evidence) (UWS, MD 0.06 ml/minute, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.11, P value 0.03, I(2) = 10%). For the outcome of stimulated whole saliva (SWS, three trials, 71 participants, low quality evidence) there was a benefit favouring acupuncture (MD 0.19 ml/minute, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.31, P value 0.002, I(2) = 1%) an effect which also persisted at the 12-month follow-up evaluation (SWS MD 0.28 ml/minute, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.47, P value 0.004, I(2) = 0%) (two trials, 54 participants, low quality evidence). Two small studies, both at high risk of bias, compared the use of an electrostimulation device with a placebo device in participants with Sjögren's Syndrome (total 101 participants). A further study, also at high risk of bias, compared acupuncture-like electrostimulation of different sets of points in participants who had previously been treated with radiotherapy. None of these studies reported the outcome of dry mouth. There was no difference between electrostimulation and placebo in the outcomes of UWS or SWS at the end of the 4-week treatment period in the one study (very low that provided data for these outcomes. No adverse effects were reported. A single study at high risk of bias, compared the stimulatory effect of powered versus manual toothbrushing and found no difference for the outcomes of UWS or SWS.

Authors' Conclusions

There is low quality evidence that acupuncture is no different from placebo acupuncture with regard to dry mouth symptoms, which is the most important outcome. This may be because there were insufficient participants included in the two trials to show a possible effect or it may be that there was some benefit due to 'placebo' acupuncture which could have biased the effect to the null. There is insufficient evidence to determine the effects of electrostimulation devices on dry mouth symptoms. It is well known that dry mouth symptoms may be problematic even when saliva production is increased, yet only two of the trials that evaluated acupuncture reported dry mouth symptoms, a worrying reporting bias. There is some low quality evidence that acupuncture results in a small increase in saliva production in patients with dry mouth following radiotherapy. There is insufficient evidence to determine the effects of electrostimulation devices on dry mouth symptoms or saliva production in patients with Sjögren's Syndrome. Reported adverse effects of acupuncture are mild and of short duration, and there were no reported adverse effects from electrostimulation.

Burning mouth syndrome (BMS) is a chronic condition characterized by burning of the oral mucosa, with or without dysgeusia and xerostomia, in the setting of no underlying systemic disease or identifiable abnormalities on physical examination or laboratory testing. BMS disproportionately affects postmenopausal women. The pathophysiology of the disease is unknown; no single treatment has proven universally successful. In light of these shortcomings, having a practical approach to the evaluation and management of patients with BMS can improve both patient quality of life and physician satisfaction.

### Xerostomia in patients on chronic hemodialysis [^115pE7M2]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2012). Medium credibility.

Xerostomia is the subjective feeling of a dry mouth, which is relatively common in patients on chronic hemodialysis. Xerostomia can be caused by reduced salivary flow secondary to atrophy and fibrosis of the salivary glands, use of certain medications, restriction of fluid intake and old age. In patients undergoing hemodialysis, xerostomia is associated with the following problems: difficulties in chewing, swallowing, tasting and speaking; increased risk of oral disease, including lesions of the mucosa, gingiva and tongue; bacterial and fungal infections, such as candidiasis, dental caries and periodontal disease; interdialytic weight gain resulting from increased fluid intake; and a reduction in quality of life. Unfortunately, no effective treatment exists for xerostomia in patients on chronic hemodialysis. The stimulation of salivary glands by mechanical means (such as chewing gum) or pharmacological agents (such as pilocarpine and angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors, the latter alone or in combination with angiotensin-receptor blockers), as well as saliva substitutes, are all ineffective, or effective only in the short term. Xerostomia remains a frustrating symptom for patients on hemodialysis, and further efforts should be made to find an effective treatment for it in the near future.

7. In people with SD who have sicca (dryness) symptoms of the mouth, what is the most clinically effective topical treatment?

A Cochrane review of topical treatments for dry mouth of any cause (including SD) found no strong evidence supporting one topical therapy over another. The authors reviewed 36 RCTs involving 1597 participants. Two compared saliva stimulants to placebo, nine compared saliva substitutes to placebo, five compared saliva stimulants directly with saliva substitutes, 18 directly compared two or more saliva substitutes, and 2 trials compared two or more saliva stimulants. Oxygenated glyceroltriester saliva substitute spray showed evidence of improved effectiveness compared with an electrolyte spray (standardized mean difference 0.77, 95% CI 0.38–1.15) which corresponds to approximately a mean difference of 2 points on a 10-point VAS for mouth dryness. Chewing gum was associated with increased saliva production in the majority of those with residual capacity but there was no evidence that gum was more or less effective than saliva substitutes.

A Cochrane review of non-pharmacological therapies for dry mouth including acupuncture (five studies), electrostimulation (three studies) and powered vs manual toothbrushing (one study) found low quality evidence that acupuncture is no different from placebo, insufficient evidence on the effect of the electrostimulation device and no evidence of a difference between manual and powered toothbrushing on the symptoms of a dry mouth.

'Oil pulling' — a technique derived from Ayurvedic medicine — has been proposed as a treatment for dry mouth. It involves rinsing the mouth with coconut or olive oil for about 5–20 min. There is anecdotal evidence of benefit and a study in 2017 showed improvement in subjective symptoms of xerostomia. A small randomized, single-blind, crossover trial in 26 individuals with medication-induced xerostomia showed no difference in rinsing with water compared with oil.

Recommendation

Suggest saliva substitutes for symptomatic relief of oral dryness (2, C) (SOA 93.3%).

### Common oral lesions… [^114V8hXG]. AAFP (2022). Medium credibility.

5–7 Oral candidiasis can present with white plaques that can be wiped off to reveal underlying erythematous mucosa, generalized mucosal erythema, less commonly as hyperplastic nonwipeable plaques with a predilection for the lateral tongue and oral commissure, or depapillation and erythema of the dorsal tongue. 5–7 Patients may report oral burning, a metallic taste, or no symptoms.
6. Hairy Tongue Retention hyperkeratosis of the filiform papillae on the anterior two-thirds of the lingual dorsum causes a furry appearance with hair-like projections that can be colonized with bacteria and take on dark pigmentation or scraping the tongue. 8, 12, 13. Mucocele Mucoceles often result from trauma, usually biting, that leads to mucus extravasation into the adjacent connective tissues. They appear most commonly on the lower lip mucosa as smooth, blue-pink masses 22, 23. Their typical location adjacent to the teeth often results in a cycle of biting, rupture, and recurrence. Small mucoceles usually resolve spontaneously. For recurrent or persistent lesions, treatment involves excision of the mass and its associated minor salivary gland.
22. Oral Lichen Planus Oral lichen planus is found in up to 2% of individuals and affects mucosa throughout the oral cavity. 25, 27 Erythematous and erosive varieties can cause pain and burning.

25 Oral lichen planus is less likely to resolve compared with cutaneous lichen planus, and patients experience relapses and remissions. 27, 29 Localized oral lichenoid reactions may occur due to hypersensitivity reactions to dental materials or other allergens.
27. Asymptomatic disease requires no treatment. Topical corticosteroids are the primary treatment. Severe presentations may require therapy with systemic prednisone. Traumatic Fibroma Fibroma is the most common oral soft tissue growth, which is thought to occur secondary to local trauma or irritation.

### Efficacy and tolerability of SEDIFL ù in treating dry or productive cough in the pediatric population (SEPEDIA): a pilot, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter clinical trial [^116Zoj5o]. Clinical Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

An acute cough consequent to an upper respiratory tract infection may persist in children for many days. A cough, mainly when prolonged, can impact quality of life, cause anxiety and distress, and affect the sleep of children and their parents or cohabitants. Coughing, especially during the night, can be particularly troubling to children and to their parents, as it often results in discomfort to the child and loss of sleep for both the child and their parents. In addition, there have been very few assessments of the associated sensations: irritation, the urge to cough, and even pain, yet these may be more important symptoms for patients with laryngitis or a post-viral cough than the actual coughing. In addition, a sore throat represents inflammation or irritation. Throat irritation also dehydrates the pharyngeal mucosa and is commonly accompanied by a dry cough, aggravating the irritative state.

No treatment option has been associated with clear benefits in terms of cough recovery. Given that some therapeutic options exhibit low effectiveness and also produce undesirable adverse effects, they are not optimal treatments. Non-pharmacological interventions, such as throat and pharynx demulcents and emollients, are an alternative for cough management and mucosa protection and do not have side effects.

A suitable strategy to treat coughing and irritation is to form a protective barrier by a formulation able to adhere to and reside on the mucosal surface, in the oral cavity as far as the pharynx. This protective barrier can be achieved with a demulcent and/or emollient effect. A demulcent is a substance that forms a soothing film over a mucous membrane to relieve minor pain and inflammation. Emollients are the ingredients responsible for the smooth feel of the skin or mucosa.

Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) — dry mouth (xerostomia) management states that patients with dry mouth are at increased risk of dental caries and should receive regular professional dental cleanings and check-ups, with mild symptoms managed with frequent sips of water, sugar-free gum and candy, and moisturizing mouthwashes, mouth spray, toothpastes, or saliva substitutes. For xerostomia and dysphagia the following therapies should be used: over-the-counter saliva substitutes can be tried, and pilocarpine or cevimeline can be used if patients remain symptomatic despite saliva substitutes. For moderate to severe symptoms, cholinergic agents, such as pilocarpine and cevimeline, can be very helpful, although other cholinergic side effects may occur.

MASCC/ISOO expert opinion — Table 3 identifies inappropriate oral care interventions to avoid, notably in salivary gland hypofunction (SGH) and xerostomia contexts. Ice chips/cubes provide only temporary and inadequate relief. Glycerol (+/− lemon) has a drying action on the oral mucosa, and acidic lemon should not be used in patients with salivary gland hypofunction/SGH because acidic products cause oral discomfort and promote dental demineralisation, dental caries and oral candidosis. Acidic artificial salivas should not be used in patients with SGH. Pineapple chunks are acidic and should not be used in patients with SGH. Vitamin C tablets are acidic and should not be used in patients with SGH. Sweets/candies contain sugars that cause dental caries and may be acidic, and such products should not be used in patients with SGH.

### Oral and dental late effects in long-term survivors of childhood embryonal brain tumors [^115dHJKN]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

In concurrence with previous studies, we found the risk of DDD to be significantly associated with cancer treatment performed before the age of 5.

Participants' self-evaluation of oral dryness (mean SXI score 6.8 ± 1.8) indicated that the overall group of survivors did not have a problem with dry mouth. However, the range of SXI score (5–13) among participants showed a wide variation within the group of MB/CNS-PNET survivors. It should be noted that neurocognitive function in long-term survivors of MB/CNS-PNET may also vary. The ability to reflect on their subjective feeling of oral dryness may thus be compromised. Most of the survivors, 80.4%, had no clinical signs of oral dryness. The rest (19.6%) showed 2–4 clinical oral dryness signs where " mirror sticking to buccal mucosa and/or tongue " and " frothy saliva " were the most frequent signs. In comparison, a Norwegian study using the same methods on survivors of adult HNC reported a mean SXI score of 11.9 ± 2.5, and 45% of 29 participants had clinical signs of severe oral dryness (CODS score > 6).

### Interventions for the treatment of burning mouth syndrome [^114cC553]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

Background

The complaint of a burning sensation in the mouth can be said to be a symptom of other disease or a syndrome in its own right of unknown aetiology. In patients where no underlying dental or medical causes are identified and no oral signs are found, the term burning mouth syndrome (BMS) should be used. The prominent feature is the symptom of burning pain which can be localised just to the tongue and/or lips but can be more widespread and involve the whole of the oral cavity. Reported prevalence rates in general populations vary from 0.7% to 15%. Many of these patients show evidence of anxiety, depression and personality disorders.

Objectives

The objectives of this review are to determine the effectiveness and safety of any intervention versus placebo for relief of symptoms and improvement in quality of life and to assess the quality of the studies.

Search Strategy

Electronic databases (The Cochrane Library, the Cochrane Oral Health Group's Specialised Register, MEDLINE, EMBASE), Clinical Evidence Issue No. 3, conference proceedings and bibliographies of identified publications were searched to identify the relevant literature, irrespective of language of publication.

Selection Criteria

Studies were selected if they met the following criteria: study design - randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled clinical trials (CCTs) which compared a placebo against one or more treatments; participants - patients with burning mouth syndrome, that is, oral mucosal pain with no dental or medical cause for such symptoms; interventions - all treatments that were evaluated in placebo-controlled trials; primary outcome - relief of burning/discomfort

Data Collection and Analysis

Articles were screened independently by two reviewers to confirm eligibility and extract data. The reviewers were not blinded to the identity of the studies. The quality of the included trials was assessed independently by two reviewers, with particular attention given to allocation concealment, blinding and the handling of withdrawals and drop-outs. Due to differences in patient type, treatment and outcome measures, statistical pooling of the data was inappropriate.

Main Results

Six trials were included in the review. The interventions examined were antidepressants (two trials), cognitive behavioural therapy (one trial), analgesics (one trial), hormone replacement therapy (one trial) and vitamin complexes (one trial). The participants included in the six identified trials reported suffering from BMS from six months to 20 years. Diagnostic criteria were not always clearly reported. Out of the six trials included in the review, only two interventions demonstrated a reduction in BMS symptoms; vitamin complexes and cognitive behavioural therapy. Neither of these studies reported using blind outcome assessment. Although none of the other treatments examined in the included studies demonstrated a significant reduction in BMS symptoms, this may be due to methodological flaws in the trial design, or small sample size, rather than a true lack of effect.

Reviewer's Conclusions

Given the chronic nature of BMS, the need to identify an effective mode of treatment for sufferers is vital. However, there is little research evidence that provides clear guidance for those treating patients with BMS. Further trials, of high methodological quality, need to be undertaken in order to establish effective forms of treatment for patients suffering from BMS.

### The art and science of oral examination [^114QsCE3]. Dermatologic Therapy (2010). Low credibility.

Performing an accurate oral examination is an integral part of a complete dermatological evaluation. As dermatologists, we are frequently asked to assess and treat numerous oral pathologies, which include, but are not limited to, normal variants, infections, ulcers, granulomas, lymphomas, as well as primary and metastatic tumors of the mouth and lips. The oral mucosa can be the window through which one can see and make numerous systemic diagnoses. Some clinicians are apprehensive about performing this evaluation, or feel that this examination is outside of their realm of expertise. These concerns may reflect limited exposure and education during training. Therefore, this article aimed to educate the readers on how to complete an oral examination, demonstrate normal variants, and highlight potential pitfalls and limitations of performing oral biopsies.

### Update on Sjögren syndrome and other causes of sicca in older adults [^113usKT6]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Dry eye and dry mouth symptoms are each reported by up to 30% of persons more than 65 years of age, particularly in women. Medication side effects are the most common contributing factors. The evaluation of these symptoms requires measures of ocular and oral dryness. Sjögren syndrome is the prototypical disease associated with dryness of the eyes and mouth and predominantly affects women in their perimenopausal and postmenopausal years. In addition to topical treatment of the mucosal dryness, patients with Sjögren syndrome may require treatment with systemic immunomodulatory and immunosuppressive agents to manage a variety of extraglandular manifestations.

### The eye as a window to oral and pain symptoms in Sjögren's disease [^116EBrTc]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

To investigate whether certain dry eye (DE) metrics relate to oral and pain manifestations of Sjögren's disease (SjD).

Methods

Secondary analysis of the Sjögren's International Collaborative Clinical Alliance dataset containing 1541 individuals with 2016 American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism defined SjD. Binary logistic regression analyses examined which of 13 DE features related to various extraocular metrics.

Results

The mean age of the population was 52 ± 13.5 years; 45% identified as white and 94% as women. Heterogeneity in DE symptoms and signs was noted in individuals with SjD, with approximately one-third of individuals reporting significant spontaneous and/or evoked pain using various descriptors and indicating certain triggers, and approximately half having low tear production. Similarly, heterogeneity was noted with respect to oral and pain complaints, with extraocular pain symptoms found in approximately one-third of the population. Different ocular phenotypes aligned with different extraocular findings. Specifically, grittiness or scratchiness in the eyes (OR = 1.6), blurred vision (OR = 1.4) and low tear production (OR = 1.8) most closely aligned with oral dryness ('Does your mouth feel dry?). On the other hand, burning or stinging in the eyes (OR = 1.6), discomfort in low humidity (OR = 1.2) and the absence of DE signs (normal tear production, OR = 0.7; lack of ocular surface staining, OR = 0.6) most closely aligned with pain outside the eye ('Do you experience persistent or frequent burning discomfort?').

Conclusions

Our findings suggest heterogeneity in SjD ocular presentations that predict extraocular features of disease and hint at mechanisms that underlie heterogeneity, namely divergent neurosensory processes.

### Abstract… [^1178mnmb]. AAFP (2010). Low credibility.

Mucosal Changes MUCOSAL PALLOR AND ATROPHY Oral findings in patients with anemia may include mucosal pallor, atrophic glossitis, and candidiasis. Oral mucosal pallor may be difficult to appreciate. 7 Atrophic glossitis appears as complete or patchy baldness of the tongue caused by atrophy of the lingual papillae. Atrophic glossitis is a nonspecific finding that can occur in association with iron deficiency anemia, pernicious anemia/vitamin B complex deficiencies, and various other conditions. Atrophy can be observed most easily on the dorsal tongue, although other sites may be affected. Burning, pain, tenderness, and erythema also may be present. Candidiasis may be a concurrent finding or an alternative cause of erythema, burning, and atrophy. In addition, some patients may present with angular cheilitis, which appears as erythema, fissuring, and crusting at the corners of the mouth.

Some characteristic abnormalities include diffuse swelling, cobblestone appearance of the mucosa, localized mucogingivitis, and deep linear ulceration. The swelling usually is persistent, firm, and painless, and tends to involve the lips, buccal mucosa, and facial soft tissues. The deep linear ulcers often occur at the depth of the buccal vestibule and may be surrounded by hyperplastic margins. Dental Erosion GASTROESOPHAGEAL REFLUX DISEASE Potential oral findings in patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease include water brash, xerostomia, burning sensation, halitosis, palatal erythema, and dental erosion. The erosion pattern in patients with gastroesophageal reflex disease tends to favor the occlusal surfaces of the mandibular posterior teeth and the lingual surfaces of the maxillary anterior teeth.

BULIMIA AND ANOREXIA Potential oral or head and neck findings of bulimia and anorexia include dental erosion, xerostomia, increased rate of caries, and sialadenosis. Vomiting exposes teeth to acidic gastric contents, which leads to enamel erosion. The erosion pattern tends to involve the lingual surfaces of the maxillary anterior teeth.

### Hyposalivation and xerostomia and burning mouth syndrome: medical management [^114CxZHi]. Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

In this chapter, the authors review the benefits of saliva and the destructive consequences of its loss. It is hoped that this will help their colleagues identify and treat patients before development of symptoms. Xerostomia is the subjective complaint of dry mouth or sensation of oral dryness. Hyposalivation is the actual decrease in measured salivary outflow. The authors discuss a compiled list of highly cited medications commonly used today that are linked with xerostomia and hyposalivation. There are numerous treatment modalities that are present, such as saliva substitutes, mouth rinses, sugar-free candy, and pilocarpine among others.

### Efficacy and safety of topical and systemic medications: a systematic literature review informing the EULAR recommendations for the management of Sjögren's syndrome [^113szE6d]. RMD Open (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Current evidence on the therapeutic management of primary-2002 SjS patients is based on 9 RCTs (only four including ≥ 100 patients randomised to drug/PLA), 18 prospective cohort studies (all including ≤ 30 patients per study) and 5 case-control studies.

For oral topical therapies, available evidence is limited to five studies carried out in SjS patients (only one in primary-2002 patients) and one Cochrane SLR that assessed the management of dry mouth. Xerostomia is a subjective symptom with wide interindividual variation, and a satisfactory output of unstimulated whole saliva in one patient may lead another to complain of symptoms of dry mouth. All studies have shown significant within-group improvement in comparison with baseline subjective oral outcomes. Mechanical stimulation (chewing gum) was associated with increased saliva production in patients with residual capacity, but there is no evidence that gum may have more or less efficacy than saliva substitutes in reducing dry mouth symptoms. Due to the wide range of interventions, small trials (mean of 45 participants per trial), the RoB and the range of outcome measures for oral dryness, there is no strong evidence to support any specific intervention over another, and the conclusion is that, in the absence of an effective topical treatment, we recommend that the treatment of xerostomia should be directed towards improving patients' complaints rather than increasing saliva production, including improvements in tooth health and the prevention of oral infections. The cost of long-term topical therapy is another important consideration, but there are no available studies on this issue. Other therapeutic interventions are under investigation. A recent double-blind, crossover-design study has evaluated the effects of intraoral electrostimulation, and further studies in primary-2002 patients are required to make a specific recommendation on its use.

### Diagnostic accuracy of patient-reported dry mouth as a predictor for oral dryness in terminally ill cancer patients [^1125b64U]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The aim of the study was to determine the diagnostic accuracy of patient-reported dry mouth using an oral moisture-checking device in terminally ill cancer patients.

Methods

The study was conducted following the STARD guidelines, and the participants were recruited prospectively from the Palliative Care Unit, Kyoto Medical Center, Japan, between 1 January 2017 and 30 November 2018. Patients reporting dry mouth were asked to rate oral dryness on a 5-point rating scale. The outcome was oral dryness at the lingual mucosa, measured using an oral moisture-checking device. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were plotted, and the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values (PPV and NPV), positive and negative likelihood ratios (LR), and overall diagnostic accuracy were calculated.

Results

Of 103 participants, the prevalence of oral dryness was 65.0%. ROC analysis indicated that patient-reported dry mouth was a poor predictor of oral dryness, with an area under the curve of 0.616 (95% confidence interval: 0.508–0.723), a sensitivity of 46.3%, a specificity of 75.8%, a PPV of 55.9%, an NPV of 68.1, a positive LR of 1.9, a negative LR of 0.7, and an overall diagnostic accuracy of 64.1%, with a cut-off value of 3 points.

Conclusion

In conclusion, patient-reported dry mouth is not a useful parameter for the assessment of oral dryness in terminally ill cancer patients.

### Diseases of the oral mucosa… [^113Rph2F]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

From an embryologic point of view, certain diseases of the oral and nasal mucosa are logically related to those on the cutaneous surface. A common ectodermic origin brings affections of these structures in closer relation to each other than with the diseases of the deeper digestive tract which originates from the entoderm. Furthermore, eruptions of the oral cavity are objectively demonstrable, and not infrequently they are a part of the clinical picture of a cutaneous eruption. Specialties in medicine frequently overlap, and borderline conditions are encountered which may pertain to general medicine, surgery or to the branch which has devoted particular attention to a certain class of affections. The implication of the mucous membranes in the acute exanthems is almost invariable. The pharyngeal congestion in scarlatina and the Koplik spots in measles aid materially in diagnosis before the skin eruption appears.

Conventional visual and tactile examination (CVTE) — scope and lesion considerations include that CVTE is performed intraorally and extraorally after review of the patient's medical, social, and dental history with assessment of symptoms and lymph node and neck examination; a major purpose is to identify mucosal or submucosal abnormalities, which have been observed in as many as 10% of patients. Important considerations are that abnormalities most commonly manifest as leukoplakia, with possible speckled leukoplakia (erythroleukoplakia) or erythroplakia; biopsies in erythroplakia or persistently ulcerated lesions are more likely to indicate OSCC or moderate to severe epithelial dysplasia; not all leukoplakias show microscopic features of epithelial dysplasia; leukoplakia progression over time is inconsistent in predicting which lesions will progress and how quickly; dysplasia can be present in clinically normal mucosa; and oral cancer may arise from a number of cells in an area field of concentration that can lead to satellite lesions rather than from a single cell.

### MASCC / ISOO clinical practice statement: management of oral complications of immunotherapy [^111Xao6N]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2025). High credibility.

Xerostomia/hyposalivation in patients on immunotherapy: The subjective sensation of dry mouth is termed xerostomia and low salivary secretion is termed hyposalivation; principles from two OCSG clinical practice statements apply to immunotherapy-associated dry mouth. There is weak evidence that dry mouth due to immunotherapy may be reversed or relieved by withholding the offending agent and possibly initiating steroid therapy. Xerostomia may not be associated with objective signs, may reflect a sensory disturbance, and such patients may benefit from treatment for oral sensory disturbances. Xerostomia is a common irAE of cancer treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) and can significantly impair the patient's health-related quality of life.

Taste disturbance — terminology, causes, and management in advanced cancer include defined symptom types and conditional guidance. Patients with advanced cancer report a variety of taste disturbances, which include ageusia (an absence of taste sensation), hypogeusia (a decrease in taste sensation), hypergeusia (an increase in taste sensation) and dysgeusia (a distortion of normal taste sensation). There are several potential causes of new-onset taste disturbance, including salivary gland hypofunction, poor oral hygiene, medication and nutritional deficiencies, and it may be an ongoing complication of the cancer and/or the oncological treatment. Management should include treatment of the underlying cause (if possible), e.g. treatment of salivary gland hypofunction (Category of guideline — suggestion: Level of evidence — IV). Symptomatic management primarily involves non-pharmacological interventions; patients should be reviewed by a dietitian and a personalised nutritional plan developed (Category of guideline — suggestion: Level of evidence — V), with strategies such as utilising foods that taste "good", avoiding foods that taste "bad", enhancing taste with salt, sugar and other flavourings, moistening food, and addressing presentation, smell, consistency and temperature (Category of guideline — suggestion: Level of evidence — V). Pharmacological interventions reported to be effective include zinc supplements (no guideline possible) and dronabinol (Category of guideline — suggestion: Level of evidence — IV), and symptomatic management of treatment-associated taste disturbance may include topical anaesthetic mouthwash (no guideline possible).

### Common oral conditions: a review [^114t53bk]. JAMA (2024). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Dry mouth, oral candidiasis, and recurrent aphthous ulcers are 3 of the most common oral conditions that may be associated with patient discomfort, decreased quality of life, and morbidity.

Observations

In a meta-analysis of 26 population-based cohort and cross-sectional studies, the global prevalence of dry mouth symptoms was 23% (95% CI, 18% to 28%), placing individuals at risk of oral candidiasis, dental caries, dysgeusia, masticatory/speech impairment, and oropharyngeal dysphagia. Dry mouth is associated with using more than 3 oral medications per day (odds ratio [OR], 2.9 [95% CI, 1.4 to 6.2]), head and neck radiation, and Sjögren disease. Symptoms may include difficulty swallowing and speaking, thirst, and halitosis. Dry mouth is associated with an 11.5% (95% CI, 3.6% to 27%) higher risk of oral candidiasis, based on a meta-analysis of 6 observational cohorts. Management of dry mouth includes mechanical salivary stimulants, oral moisturizers, and/or systemic sialagogues. Oral candidiasis is an opportunistic fungal infection caused by overgrowth of the Candida genus with C albicans, which accounts for 76.8% of infections. The prevalence of oral candidiasis is higher in patients who are immunosuppressed, for example, those with HIV (35% [95% CI, 28% to 42%]) and those with salivary gland hypofunction (OR, 3.02 [95% CI, 1.73 to 5.28]). Common risk factors associated with oral candidiasis include use of antibiotics (P = 0.04) and oral mucosal disorders such as lichen planus. Oral burning and dysgeusia are common symptoms of oral candidiasis. Treatment includes addressing risk factors and use of topical and/or systemic antifungal medications. Recurrent aphthous stomatitis is characterized by symptomatic round or oval oral ulcers, which are covered by a gray-white fibrin layer and encircled by an erythematous ring. A meta-analysis of 10 case-controlled studies revealed an increased risk of recurrent aphthous stomatitis associated with polymorphism of IL-1β (+3954C/T) (OR, 1.52 [95% CI, 1.07 to 2.17]) and IL-1β (-511C/T) (OR, 1.35 [95% CI, 1.09 to 1.67]). Another meta-analysis of 9 case-control studies reported that patients with recurrent aphthous stomatitis had a higher frequency of nutritional deficiencies, including vitamin B12 (OR, 3.75 [95% CI, 2.38 to 5.94]), folic acid (OR, 7.55 [95% CI, 3.91 to 14.60]), and ferritin (OR, 2.62 [95% CI, 1.69 to 4.06]). Recurrent aphthous stomatitis can be associated with systemic diseases. A meta-analysis of 21 case-control studies revealed that celiac disease is associated with a higher incidence of recurrent aphthous stomatitis (25% vs 11%; OR, 3.79 [95% CI, 2.67 to 5.39]; P < .001). Topical corticosteroids are first-line agents to manage recurrent aphthous stomatitis; however, systemic medications may be necessary in more severe cases.

Conclusions and Relevance

Dry mouth, oral candidiasis, and recurrent aphthous ulcers are common oral conditions that may be associated with patient discomfort, decreased quality of life, and morbidity. First-line treatment includes over-the-counter sialagogues for dry mouth, topical antifungals for oral candidiasis, and topical corticosteroids for aphthous ulcers. Oral conditions that do not improve with first-line treatment may require treatment with systemic medications.

At each survivorship visit screen for cGVHD by history and again about high-risk habits; head/ neck/ oral exam. Symptoms: dry mouth, difficulty swallowing, pain in the oral cavity. Council to avoid smoking, vaping, and chewing tobacco, decrease regular intake of sugar containing beverages, avoid intraoral piercing, pursue post-HCT human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccination. Patients with xerostomia should receive meticulous oral hygiene, undertake preventive measures for dental/ periodontal disease, and aggressive treatment of oral infections. Trauma to oral mucosa should be avoided. Mouthguards may be useful. Avoid medications that can cause or exacerbate xerostomia.

Specific recommendations

Dry mouth (xerostomia; salivary gland hypofunction)

Terminology

Xerostomia refers to a subjective sensation of dryness of the mouth, whilst salivary gland hypofunction refers to an objective decrease in salivary gland secretion(s).

Aetiology

There are many potential causes for a dry mouth in patients with advanced cancer. However, the main cause relates to the adverse effects of medication used within general medicine and oncology/palliative care.

Management

Management should include treatment of the underlying cause (if possible), e.g. discontinuation of offending medication (Category of guideline — suggestion: Level of evidence — V). Symptomatic management involves both non-pharmacological and pharmacological interventions.

Non-pharmacological interventions include water, artificial salivas (Category of guideline — recommendation: Level of evidence — II, i.e. mucin-based artificial saliva), chewing gum (Category of guideline — recommendation: Level of evidence — II) and acupuncture (No guideline possible). Artificial salivas tend to have a longer duration of action than water, and a number of commercial products are available, which differ in formulation (e.g. spray, gel), pH (e.g. acidic, neutral), lubricant (e.g. mucin, carboxymethylcellulose) and additional ingredients (e.g. flavourings, fluoride). Ideally, an artificial saliva should have a neutral pH (to limit demineralisation of the teeth) and contain fluoride (to enhance remineralisation of the teeth).

Pharmacological interventions include pilocarpine (Category of guideline — recommendation: Level of evidence — II) and related products (e.g. bethanechol, cevimeline). (Currently, there is no evidence to support the use of intraoral pilocarpine eyedrops in this condition).

Saliva stimulants (e.g. sugar-free chewing gum, pilocarpine) are generally preferred to saliva substitutes (e.g. water, artificial salivas) when the salivary glands can be stimulated, since they are more effective in relieving xerostomia, and they should improve the other problems associated with salivary gland hypofunction (see above). It should be noted that the evidence on managing xerostomia/salivary gland hypofunction per se is of limited quality.

### MASCC / ISOO clinical practice statement: management of salivary gland hypofunction and xerostomia in cancer patients [^116sbmeP]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Dry mouth is a common and distressing symptom among patients undergoing cancer therapy and cancer survivors. Often in head and neck cancer patients, dry mouth is life-long. Dry mouth is a layperson term used when patients experience either salivary gland hypofunction, xerostomia, or both. Among healthcare professionals, the terms salivary gland hypofunction and xerostomia are used to describe objectively low saliva secretion and the subjective sensation of oral dryness, respectively.

Saliva plays a crucial role in daily functions such as taste perception as well as facilitating chewing, swallowing, and speech. It is also essential in maintaining tooth and mucosal integrity, including protecting mucosal surfaces against trauma and opportunistic infections. The Oral Care Study Group (OCSG) of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer (MASCC) and the International Society of Oral Oncology (ISOO) have previously published several systematic reviews on the management of salivary gland hypofunction and xerostomia in cancer patients. However, these reviews described interventions that have been evaluated in clinical trials but did not include many non-invasive interventions accepted by expert opinion to be beneficial for patients suffering from salivary gland hypofunction and/or xerostomia. The published MASCC/ISOO reviews also do not provide details as to how these interventions are prescribed. Therefore, a working group of the OCSG of MASCC/ISOO was established to formulate an expert-opinion Clinical Practice Statement (CPS) to provide a concise summary for clinicians to reference when prescribing these interventions.

A 51-year-old woman was referred to oral medicine with a 2-month history of progressive paraesthesia of the right lip, chin and oral mucosa. Examination revealed decreased sensation to the right dermatone of the inferior alveolar nerve and allodynia to light touch of the lower lip. An MRI of the head revealed bilateral cisternal trigeminal nerve pathological enhancement. While blood tests suggested a connective tissue disorder as the cause of the trigeminal neuralgia, a subsequent diagnosis of high-grade serous ovarian cancer gave a differential diagnosis of paraneoplastic syndrome.

### Best patient care practices for administering PSMA-targeted radiopharmaceutical therapy [^117Xe3GX]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Dry Mouth

The salivary glands are among the organs with the highest absorbed doses of radiation after [177 Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 administration and therefore may be affected during treatment. Salivary toxicity is a common side effect of PSMA-targeted RPT, reported to be associated with higher treatment responses, and remains a management challenge. Low-grade (grade 1–2) dry mouth was a common AE in VISION, reported in 38.8% of [177 Lu]Lu-PSMA-617–treated patients versus 0.5% of SoC-treated patients; no patients in either group experienced grade 3–4 events.

Patients should be assessed for symptoms of dry mouth both before initiating treatment with [177 Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 and at subsequent follow-ups to determine its severity and to distinguish between nocturnal dryness and symptoms of dry mouth that limit oral function. Patients with mCRPC who present with preexisting dry mouth can be at greater risk of developing long-term complications and should be monitored closely for worsening symptoms. Future studies are required to assess whether dry-mouth symptoms can be anticipated individually with PSMA PET. To ensure adequate detection of this AE in RPT, physicians can use the FACT-RNT.

Although there is no consensus on dry-mouth management, Muniz et al. recently provided an overview of the preventive and palliative measures that physicians can use. In VISION, patients experiencing dry mouth were advised to use sodium bicarbonate mouthwash during the first 3 d of each cycle. In clinical practice, additional strategies have been used, including good hydration and use of saliva gel to stimulate salivary flow; other strategies include parasympathomimetics (e.g. pilocarpine), hard sugarless candies or gum, xylitol, and gum disks. Of note, no controlled studies testing these strategies have been conducted.

### MASCC / ISOO expert opinion on the management of oral problems in patients with advanced cancer [^111gDih2]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

The management of oral problems should be evidence-based and/or based upon established principles from dentistry/oral medicine (Category of guideline – suggestion; Level of evidence — V)

Unfortunately, oral care within clinical practice (palliative care) is often based on "anecdotal remedies", with little regard for the established principles of oral care developed within dentistry/oral medicine. Thus, many recommended interventions are relatively ineffective, or completely inappropriate, for their stated purpose(s) (Table 3).

Table 3
Inappropriate oral care interventions

Relevant treatments/interventions should be available in all settings wherever possible (Category of guideline – suggestion; Level of evidence — V)

All patients should have access to the optimal treatment for their oral problems, although treatment needs to be individualised according to the patient's condition, their care setting and their ability to attend other care settings (e.g. dental surgery, hospital). Nevertheless, most common interventions can be provided in any care settings, and some dental procedures can be performed at the bedside/in the patient's home ("domiciliary dental care").

All patients with oral problems should be regularly reassessed (Category of guideline – suggestion; Level of evidence — V)

All patients with oral problems need to be reassessed in a timely manner (after initiation of treatment), and regularly going forward. The objectives of re-assessment are to determine (a) changes in the clinical condition; (b) adherence with any treatment; (c) the effectiveness of the treatment and (d) the tolerability of the treatment. Inadequate reassessment may result in continuation of ineffective interventions and so persistence or progression of the oral problem.

Patients with recurrent oral problems often have an ongoing underlying cause(s). For example, oral candidosis is often associated with xerostomia/salivary gland hypofunction in patients with advanced cancer, and although the clinical infection may respond to a course of antifungal medication, it invariably reoccurs after a short period of time (if the salivary gland hypofunction is not adequately managed — see the "Dry mouth (xerostomia; salivary gland hypofunction)" section).

### Novel aspects of Sjögren's syndrome in 2012 [^111PLorJ]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Clinical features and classification

SS typically presents as dry eyes (xerophthalmia or keratoconjunctivitis sicca (KCS)) and dry mouth (xerostomia). KCS usually presents insidiously over a period of several years. Affected patients may describe a 'gritty' or 'sandy' feeling in their eyes. Complications of xerophthalmia include corneal ulceration and infection of the eyelids. Dryness of the mouth may give rise to difficulties in the swallowing of dry foods without fluid, and need for frequent small sips of water, also at night. Loss of the protective and antimicrobial properties of saliva may increase dental caries and predispose patients to oral candidiasis. Parotid swelling and other xeroses, such as dryness of the nose, throat, skin, and vagina, also often occur.

Establishing the diagnosis of SS is often difficult. The symptoms are non-specific: sicca symptoms are extremely common, especially in older patients, partly due to age-related atrophy of secreting tissues and partly due to other conditions, especially use of drugs.

No single laboratory test allows for definitive diagnosis of SS. However, a combination of abnormal test results is frequently observed: elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), mild normochromic normocytic anemia, leukopenia and polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia.

Autoantibodies are present in the majority of SS cases: rheumatoid factor (RF), Anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA) and anti-Ro and anti-La are strongly indicative of SS, although not exclusive.

There is no single disease-specific diagnostic criterion for SS. The most widely used classification criteria are those revised in 2002 by a joint effort by research groups in Europe and in the USA (American-European Consensus Group (AECG)) (Table 1). In addition to the subjective symptoms of dry eyes and dry mouth, the following objective signs should be present: ocular signs by Schirmer's I test and/or Rose Bengal score; focal sialadenitis by histopathology; salivary gland involvement by salivary scintigraphy, parotid sialography or unstimulated salivary flow; and autoantibodies of anti-Ro and/or anti-La specificity. The diagnostic role of the histopathology of minor salivary glands has been considered important and is currently considered as a 'gold standard', although a recent meta-analysis has shown that the diagnostic usefulness has actually only been evaluated in a few studies.

The most prevalent symptoms, dry mouth and taste disturbances, were reported in all clinically or microbiologically defined subgroups. The most prevalent clinical finding, plaques other than thrush, and the leading microbiological finding (yeasts in 72 of 101 patients.) was found in all subgroups defined by symptoms. Significant (or nearly significant) correlations were demonstrated in only six pairs of symptoms and findings (Table 7). However, only the correlation between dry mouth and other plaques (oral mucosa) is significant compared to a Bonferroni-adjusted significance level.

### The practical evaluation and management of patients with symptoms of a sore burning mouth [^111VMYwW]. Clinics in Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

There are many etiologic factors to consider in a patient who presents with symptoms or sensations of a sore burning mouth. These range from local causes within the oral cavity to underlying systemic disease, including psychologic factors. This paper aims to describe the different clinical presentations and to outline a systematic approach to the evaluation and management of such patients. The clinician will be directed to the relevant diagnosis by following the traditional medical model of taking a focused history, performing a thorough clinical examination, considering the potential differential diagnoses, and requesting pertinent and appropriate investigations. The various differential diagnoses and broad treatment options will also be discussed and outlined. This paper will not, however, discuss burning mouth syndrome (oral dysesthesia), which is a diagnosis of exclusion, whereby the oral mucosa is clinically normal and there are no identifiable medical or dental causes to account for the patient's symptoms.

### Self-perceived oral health in hemato-oncological patients and the relation to quality of life [^1151ySMk]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In the Netherlands, yearly more than 10,000 patients are newly diagnosed with hematologic malignancies, mostly in adult patients. While watchful waiting is applied in patients with slowly progressing malignancies, most patients with hematologic malignancies are treated with chemotherapy, often in combination with immunotherapy or radiotherapy. In selected high-risk diseases, patients undergo chemotherapy followed by an autologous (stem cells from the patient) or allogeneic (stem cells from a donor) stem cell transplantation (SCT). Autologous SCT can be administered in patients with multiple myeloma, (non)Hodgkin lymphoma, and acute myeloid leukemia, while allogeneic SCT can be administered for acute leukemia, (non)Hodgkin lymphoma, and myelodysplastic syndrome.

Patients treated for hematologic malignancies may experience treatment-induced complications of the oral cavity and peri-oral tissues. Oral mucositis is one of the most frequent acute complications of treatment, affecting quality of life negatively. It is characterized by erythema, ulceration, pain, difficulty eating, and higher need for pain medication. Other acute complications of hemato-oncologic therapies include xerostomia (feeling of a dry mouth), hyposalivation (decreased saliva production), oral infections, and taste changes. In most cases, these complications resolve within weeks or months following the completion of chemotherapy, but may persist and become chronic in some patients.

All SCT patients may also experience late oral complications such as xerostomia, hyposalivation, higher caries activity, and taste changes, possibly leading to lower quality of life. Moreover, patients that received an allogeneic SCT may develop oral chronic graft-versus-host disease. These patients may suffer from oral mucosal pain and ulceration, mucosal sensitivity to certain foods and liquids, dry mouth, loss of taste, and more rarely from a decreased mouth opening. Patients with a history of oral chronic graft-versus-host disease are at increased risk for oral cancer. Salivary gland dysfunction leads to a higher risk of caries and fungal infection, as protective properties of saliva are less present in the oral cavity. Several drugs used in the treatment of hemato-oncologic patients cause dry mouth and thereby also contribute to this problem.

### Protective effects of polysaccharides and polyhydric alcohols in a dry mouth model in cultured cells [^112SXUnU]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Healthy oral mucosa is covered with fluent mucous to protect the mucosa, epithelium, and teeth as a physical barrier from external stress; to reduce friction in the oral cavity and facilitate movement of the lips, tongue, cheek, and jaw; and to help articulation, conversation, swallowing, mastication, and taste perception. The mucous is produced from saliva, and a decrease in the amount of saliva disturbs these effects and results in a reduced quality of life (QOL). Dry mouth is a frequent symptom in the oral cavity of cancer patients undergoing treatment such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy in the head and neck region. These therapies induce various oral side effects and complications, including mucositis, dysphagia, infection, sensitivity, and dry mouth. The oral flora is changed in patients with dry mouth due to administration of drugs with adverse reactions and radiotherapy in head and neck. The change in oral flora can be caused by alternation of innate antimicrobial properties with decreased saliva. Human saliva contains a number of agents that protect oral tissues against noxious compounds produced by various microorganisms. The properties of salivary components which play innate defense roles change in people with poor saliva. Volatile sulfer compounds (VSC) are responsible for halitosis, and the risk of oral candidiasis and caries increases as the salivary secretion decreases. In addition, dry mouth can change the oral mucosa and lead to a dried mucosal surface, mucosal flare, coated tongue, and atrophy of the tongue papillae. Such symptoms are caused by reduced self-protection by saliva. For these reasons, severe dry mouth observed in oral cancer patients requires treatment with moisturizers.

Moisturizers for treatment of oral dryness are classified into agents for improving salivation and as saliva substitutes for retaining moisture in the oral cavity. Saliva-promoting agents include muscarinic agonists such as cevimeline hydrochloride and pilocarpine hydrochloride, which improve salivation through effects on the autonomic nervous system. Consequently, these drugs are associated with adverse reactions that reduce QOL, such as sweating, and may also cause gastrointestinal dysfunction. In contrast, saliva substitutes have few adverse reactions. These agents are composed of polymer thickeners and polyhydric alcohols that retain moisture in the oral mucosa. However, most studies of these products have used questionnaires or rheological assessment in vitro to evaluate efficacy, neither of which is appropriate for objective assessment of their effects in humans. In this study, the effects of these agents were evaluated in cell culture, which provides a better evaluation of the probable effect in vivo.

Several different types of lichenoid lesions may affect the oral cavity, and it is imperative that these are correctly diagnosed to ensure effective patient care. Lichenoid lesions such as chronic ulcerative stomatitis prove to be challenging as these are recalcitrant, present with overlapping features, require unique treatment and patients suffer a long time if not promptly diagnosed.

### Salivary gland disorders… [^116bYvpR]. AAFP (2014). Low credibility.

Staphylococcus aureus, which has been cultured in 50% to 90% of cases. 7, 8 Streptococcal species and Haemophilus influenzae are also common causes. 9 Patients with acute sialadenitis typically present with acute onset of pain and swelling of the affected gland. Physical examination may reveal induration, edema, and extreme localized tenderness. Massage of the gland may express pus from the respective intraoral orifice. This should be cultured to direct antibiotic therapy. Management involves treating the infection and reversing the underlying medical condition and predisposing factors. This includes stimulation of salivary flow by application of warm compresses, administration of sialagogues such as lemon drops or vitamin C lozenges. 10 hydration, salivary gland massage, and oral hygiene.

Empiric antimicrobial therapy is initially directed at gram-positive and anaerobic organisms, which are often penicillin-resistant, so augmented penicillin that contains beta-lactamase inhibitors are recommended. Culture-directed therapy is administered, if possible. Rarely, acute suppurative sialadenitis can lead to abscess formation; surgical drainage is indicated in these cases. 3, 13 Patients typically present with recurrent or low-grade swelling and tenderness of the affected gland, especially when eating. Physical examination may reveal enlargement of the gland early on, but this may reverse in later stages of the disease. Massaging the gland toward the orifice often does not produce visible saliva. Workup should focus on identifying a predisposing factor, such as a calculus or stricture.

Viral Infections MUMPS Mumps is the most common cause of non-suppurative acute sialadenitis; 85% of cases occur in children younger than 15 years. 4 The disease is highly contagious and spreads by airborne droplets from salivary, nasal, and urinary secretions. The parotitis is characterized by local pain and edema, as well as otalgia and trismus. Most cases are bilateral, though it commonly begins on one side. Diagnosis is confirmed through viral serology. Treatment involves supportive measures, including hydration, oral hygiene, and pain control. Edema typically resolves over several weeks. Vaccination, which is usually completed by four to six years of age, is 88% effective in preventing mumps and has reduced the incidence by 99%. 24.

### COVID-19 from the perspective of dentists: a case report and brief review of more than 170 cases [^113CHvaW]. Dermatologic Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

A novel coronavirus which has appeared from China, has been circulating hastily around the world. We summarized the publications including oral manifestation of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases based on PubMed and Google Scholar data bases, and also present a case that highlights oral lesions 2days prior to the first COVID-19 general symptoms. Two authors independently reviewed the papers, 17 studies of more than 170 confirmed cases between ages of 9 and 90 were included. The most common oral manifestation was dry mouth followed by dysgeusia and pseudomembranous fungal structure. Change in tongue sensation and ulceration, muscle pain during mastication, swelling in oral cavity, and herpetic lesions were other common symptoms. Associated symptoms, latency time, treatment, and prognosis have also been meticulously reviewed. We hope that careful clinical intraoral examination on all COVID-19 positive patients and equally on any patients who need dental care will pave the way for further studies.

Salivary glands

Salivary flow

Saliva is necessary for maintaining oral health, facilitating digestion and providing an antimicrobial defence mechanism. The salivary glands contain ERs and therefore could be vulnerable to changes in circulating oestrogen levels. A number of studies have found postmenopausal women to have lower salivary flow rates compared with menstruating women, predisposing to dental plaque, oral infections (such as candidiasis) and taste disturbance. The saliva is also subject to changes in composition during menopause, including increased concentrations of salivary calcium, which carries potential implications such as faster mineralization of plaques and increased susceptibility to periodontitis.

Xerostomia

Xerostomia is the subjective feeling of dry mouth while hyposalivation is the objective reduction in salivary flow. Xerostomia and reduced saliva flow are both well‐recognized symptoms among menopausal women. Interestingly a study by Minicucci et al.found that although salivary flow rates were reduced in postmenopausal women, there was no association with the sensation of dry mouth. The cause of xerostomia is multifactorial, and currently no topical therapy has proven to be most effective in reducing the symptoms of dry mouth. A recent case–control study conducted by Wang et al.found a reduction in dry mouth symptoms following HRT, but no improvements in burning sensations or waking up thirsty at night. However, the study had a small sample size and carried the possibility of bias through subjective questionnaire responses.

### Interventions for the management of dry mouth: topical therapies [^1136D6fw]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Xerostomia (the feeling of dry mouth) is a common symptom especially in older adults. Causes of dry mouth include medications, autoimmune disease (Sjögren's Syndrome), radiotherapy or chemotherapy for cancer, hormone disorders and infections.

Objectives

To determine which topical treatments for dry mouth are effective in reducing this symptom.

Search Methods

We searched the following electronic databases: the Cochrane Oral Health Group Trials Register (28 October 2011), The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library, Issue 4 2011), MEDLINE via OVID (1950 to 28 October 2011), EMBASE via OVID (1980 to 28 October 2011), CINAHL via EBSCO (1980 to 28 October 2011), AMED via OVID (1985 to 28 October 2011), CANCERLIT via PubMed (1950 to 28 October 2011).

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials of topical interventions such as lozenges, sprays, mouthrinses, gels, oils, chewing gum or toothpastes for the treatment of dry mouth symptom. We classified interventions into two broad categories, saliva stimulants and saliva substitutes, and these were compared with either placebo or another intervention. We included both parallel group and crossover trials.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two or more review authors independently carried out data extraction and assessed risk of bias. Trial authors were contacted for additional information as required.

Main Results

Thirty-six randomised controlled trials involving 1597 participants met the inclusion criteria. Two trials compared saliva stimulants to placebo, nine trials compared saliva substitutes to placebo, five trials compared saliva stimulants directly with saliva substitutes, 18 trials directly compared two or more saliva substitutes, and two trials directly compared two or more saliva stimulants. Only one trial was at low risk of bias and 17 were at high risk of bias. Due to the range of interventions, comparisons and outcome measures in the trials, meta-analysis was possible for only a few comparisons. Oxygenated glycerol triester (OGT) saliva substitute spray shows evidence of effectiveness compared to an electrolyte spray (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.77, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.38 to 1.15) which corresponds to approximately a mean difference of 2 points on a 10-point visual analogue scale (VAS) for mouth dryness. Both integrated mouthcare systems (toothpaste + gel + mouthwash) and oral reservoir devices show promising results but there is insufficient evidence at present to recommend their use. Although chewing gum is associated with increased saliva production in the majority of those with residual capacity, there is no evidence that gum is more or less effective than saliva substitutes.

Authors' Conclusions

There is no strong evidence from this review that any topical therapy is effective for relieving the symptom of dry mouth. OGT spray is more effective than an aqueous electrolyte spray (SMD 0.77, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.15) which is approximately equivalent to a mean difference of 2 points on a 10-point VAS scale for mouth dryness. Chewing gums appear to increase saliva production in those with residual secretory capacity and may be preferred by patients, but there is no evidence that gum is better or worse than saliva substitutes. Integrated mouthcare systems and oral reservoir devices may be helpful but further research is required to confirm this. Well designed, adequately powered randomised controlled trials of topical interventions for dry mouth, which are designed and reported according to CONSORT guidelines, are required to provide evidence to guide clinical care. For many people the symptom of dry mouth is a chronic problem and trials should evaluate whether treatments are palatable, effective in reducing xerostomia, as well as the long-term effects of treatments on quality of life of those with chronic dry mouth symptoms.
