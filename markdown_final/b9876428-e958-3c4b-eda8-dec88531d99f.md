## Question

Treatment for acute asthma exacerbation?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the treatment for acute asthma exacerbation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate assessment and severity stratification. Then, I should verify first-line bronchodilator therapy and dosing. Next, I will review systemic corticosteroids, including dose, duration, and route. After that, I need to check adjuncts for severe disease, such as ipratropium, IV magnesium, and heliox. I will then consider oxygen targets and when to escalate to noninvasive ventilation or intubation. I should confirm disposition criteria and post-exacerbation care, including inhaler technique, action plans, and follow-up. Finally, I will address special populations and synthesize a practical algorithm, making sure each step aligns with high-quality guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the initial assessment priorities and severity framework, because treatment hinges on this. I need to check vitals, mental status, speech, accessory muscle use, and pulse oximetry, and I should document lung function with PEF or FEV1 if feasible without delaying care, since objective measures better reflect severity than symptoms alone; GINA recommends obtaining PEF/FEV1 when possible and reassessing at 1 hour, and I should also consider ABG if PEF/FEV1 is less than 50% predicted or if the patient is not responding to initial therapy [^113GzsoZ] [^112MfK2d] [^111ez4KU].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about severity categories; I should verify the thresholds. Moderate exacerbations typically have normal mentation, moderate symptoms, SpO2 at least 90%, and PEF/FEV1 about 60–80% of predicted or personal best, whereas severe exacerbations have significant distress, SpO2 less than 90%, and PEF/FEV1 less than 60%; life-threatening features include altered mentation, cyanosis, silent chest, or impending respiratory arrest, which mandate immediate ICU-level care and aggressive therapy [^113d8vdw] [^112HE3BK].

> Next, I should review first-line bronchodilator therapy and dosing, and I need to ensure I distinguish mild-to-moderate from severe presentations. For mild-to-moderate exacerbations, repeated inhaled short-acting beta-agonist (SABA) via MDI with spacer is preferred, typically 4–10 puffs every 20 minutes for up to three doses, with reassessment after each cycle; if there is a good response, I should stop additional SABA to avoid overtreatment, and if response is incomplete, I should continue and escalate as indicated [^113TEkak] [^111fyQ1M]. For severe exacerbations, I should use continuous or frequently repeated SABA nebulization, often every 20 minutes initially, and add ipratropium early because combination therapy improves outcomes; I should confirm that GINA supports adding ipratropium to SABA for moderate-to-severe cases to reduce hospitalizations and improve lung function [^117YNbRp] [^1158sEkS].

> I will now examine systemic corticosteroids, since timing and route matter. Systemic corticosteroids should be administered within 1 hour of presentation for essentially all but the mildest exacerbations, because they accelerate recovery and reduce relapse; oral prednisone is as effective as IV and is preferred for speed, convenience, and cost, with typical adult dosing of 40–50 mg daily for 5–7 days and pediatric dosing of 1–2 mg/kg/day up to 40 mg for 3–5 days, and there is no need to taper after short courses if the patient is on maintenance ICS [^116KTsTS] [^112UTXGN] [^115sPaLx]. Wait, let me verify dexamethasone options; GINA notes updated evidence allowing dexamethasone in some regimens, but if using dexamethasone, I should limit to 1–2 days and switch to prednisolone if there is no resolution or relapse, to avoid undertreatment [^1179T5GD] [^1121xZVs].

> For patients with severe or life-threatening features, I should confirm adjunctive therapies. Adding ipratropium to SABA reduces hospitalizations and improves lung function in adolescents and adults, so I should not delay this in moderate-to-severe cases [^117YNbRp]. Intravenous magnesium sulfate as a single 2 g infusion over 20 minutes is reasonable for patients with persistent hypoxemia or FEV1 less than 60% predicted after 1 hour of care, and it reduces hospital admissions, including in adults with very low FEV1 at presentation; I should double-check that this applies to both adults and children, which GINA supports [^113scWj1]. Heliox-driven nebulization can be considered in severe, refractory cases, though evidence is mixed and it is not first-line; I should reserve it for nonresponders after standard therapy [^113nFGzY] [^1119mi5A]. I need to ensure I avoid routine IV beta-agonists, as evidence does not support their routine use in severe exacerbations, and I should avoid methylxanthines given inferior efficacy and higher toxicity compared with SABA [^114QSgjc] [^112jnau7].

> Oxygen therapy deserves careful attention, and I should verify targets. Titrate supplemental oxygen to achieve SpO2 93–95% in adults and adolescents; avoid both hypoxemia and excessive hyperoxia, which can worsen V/Q mismatch and hypercapnia in susceptible patients, and I should monitor for rising CO2 retention in those with severe obstruction or altered mental status [^112VhsBR] [^112Npigm]. But wait, what if the patient is deteriorating with rising CO2 and mental status changes? In that scenario, I should obtain ABG and consider noninvasive ventilation or intubation rather than escalating oxygen indiscriminately [^111ez4KU].

> I should confirm disposition criteria and the 1-hour reassessment. After initial therapy, I will reassess symptoms, work of breathing, and PEF/FEV1; if PEF/FEV1 is 60–80% of predicted or personal best and symptoms are improved, discharge planning is reasonable, whereas if PEF/FEV1 is less than 60% or there is inadequate clinical response, I should continue treatment and reassess frequently, with a low threshold for ICU transfer if deterioration occurs [^113d8vdw] [^112HE3BK]. Hold on, I should verify that this 1-hour checkpoint is guideline-endorsed; yes, GINA explicitly recommends measuring lung function at 1 hour and using these thresholds to guide disposition [^113d8vdw].

> Next, I should review post-exacerbation care to prevent relapse, and I need to ensure I cover medications, education, and follow-up. Discharge medications should include a short course of oral corticosteroids if not already completed, and critically, patients should be started or continued on ICS-containing maintenance therapy because SABA-only regimens are no longer recommended; ICS reduce future exacerbations and mortality, and I should confirm inhaler technique and adherence before discharge [^116RwoLR] [^111EpqPw]. I should arrange follow-up within 2–7 days and provide or update a written asthma action plan; after the exacerbation, maintenance ICS can generally be stepped back to pre-exacerbation levels in 2–4 weeks if control is good, but if control was poor beforehand, I should consider stepping up therapy and addressing triggers and adherence [^112gXV5Y] [^116aFjD9].

> Let me consider special populations, and I should double-check nuances. In children, the same core principles apply, with SABA and systemic corticosteroids as first-line; IV magnesium reduces hospitalizations and length of stay in severe cases, and early ICS in the ED may reduce admission and systemic steroid needs, though agent, dose, and duration vary and cost can be a barrier; I should avoid routine CXR unless there are concerning signs or alternative diagnoses [^1119mi5A] [^114dekQp] [^116z52Kq]. In pregnancy, maintain standard acute therapies, prioritize oxygen to keep SpO2 at least 95%, and use systemic corticosteroids when indicated; monitor maternal–fetal status closely. In older adults, I should have a lower threshold for CXR to evaluate for complicating cardiopulmonary disease and consider drug interactions with beta-blockers or NSAIDs [^116z52Kq].

> I should confirm antibiotic stewardship, because overtreatment is common. Routine antibiotics are not indicated for acute asthma exacerbations unless there is strong evidence of infection such as fever with purulent sputum or radiographic pneumonia; I need to ensure I do not conflate viral-triggered exacerbations with bacterial infection [^116rnTG6] [^113fpqzA].

> Now, let me synthesize a practical algorithm and sanity-check each step. Assess severity objectively with vitals, symptoms, and PEF/FEV1; give SABA promptly with spacer or nebulizer depending on severity; add ipratropium for moderate-to-severe cases; administer systemic corticosteroids within 1 hour for most; escalate to IV magnesium, heliox, or NIPPV selectively in severe or refractory cases; titrate oxygen to 93–95%; reassess at 1 hour using lung function and clinical status to decide discharge versus continued care; on discharge, ensure ICS-containing therapy, a short OCS course if indicated, inhaler technique review, a written action plan, and follow-up in 2–7 days; this aligns with GINA and AAFP guidance and integrates the highest-quality evidence available [^116KTsTS] [^113d8vdw] [^115sLYex].

> Finally, I should double-check key evidence gaps and communicate uncertainty where it exists. While many recommendations are strong, some adjuncts like heliox have low-to-moderate certainty, and the optimal early ICS strategy in the ED remains an area of evolving evidence and cost-sensitive decision-making; I need to tailor choices to patient risk, access, and local practice patterns while staying anchored to core therapies that consistently improve outcomes [^1119mi5A] [^115vEybj].

The cornerstone of acute asthma exacerbation management is **rapid bronchodilation with SABA plus early systemic corticosteroids** to reverse airflow obstruction and reduce inflammation [^116KTsTS] [^115sLYex]. Add **ipratropium for moderate–severe cases** to improve outcomes [^117YNbRp], and use IV magnesium for severe or refractory cases to reduce hospitalizations [^113scWj1]. Titrate oxygen to SpO2 93–95% [^112VhsBR], monitor lung function at 1 hour [^113d8vdw], and escalate to noninvasive ventilation or intubation if respiratory failure develops [^114XWTeM]. On discharge, prescribe ICS-containing therapy [^116RwoLR], a short OCS course [^117JTinJ], and ensure follow-up in 2–7 days with an updated action plan [^112gXV5Y].

## Initial assessment and severity classification

Rapid assessment of severity guides therapy and disposition; **objective measures (PEF/FEV1) are preferred** when feasible [^113GzsoZ] [^112MfK2d].

| **Severity** | **Clinical features** | **PEF/FEV1** |
|-|-|-|
| Mild | - Minimal dyspnea <br/> - No accessory muscle use <br/> - Normal speech | 70–100% predicted |
| Moderate | - Increased dyspnea <br/> - Accessory muscles <br/> - Speech phrases | 50–69% predicted |
| Severe | - Marked dyspnea <br/> - Accessory muscles <br/> - Speech words | 30–49% predicted |
| Life-threatening | - Cyanosis <br/> - Altered mental status <br/> - Silent chest | < 30% predicted |

## Core pharmacologic management

### Bronchodilators

- **Short-acting beta-agonists (SABA)**: First-line; 4–10 puffs every 20 minutes for 1 hour [^113TEkak], then titrate to response [^115sLYex].
- **Ipratropium bromide**: Add for moderate–severe exacerbations to reduce hospitalizations and improve lung function [^117YNbRp] [^1119mi5A].
- **IV beta-agonists**: Not recommended routinely due to limited benefit and safety concerns [^114QSgjc].

---

### Systemic corticosteroids

- **Indication**: All but the mildest exacerbations to speed resolution and prevent relapse [^116KTsTS] [^1117x8e1].
- **Dosing**: Adults 40–50 mg/day for 5–7 days [^112UTXGN]; children 1–2 mg/kg/day (max 40 mg) for 3–5 days [^114zsRLf].
- **Route**: Oral preferred; IV if unable to take orally [^116KTsTS].
- **Tapering**: Not required for short courses (< 2 weeks) [^111vyWEz] [^115sPaLx].

---

### Adjunctive therapies

- **IV magnesium sulfate**: 2 g over 20 minutes for severe or refractory cases; reduces hospitalizations [^113scWj1] [^1119mi5A].
- **Heliox**: Consider in severe, refractory cases to improve aerosol delivery and reduce work of breathing [^113nFGzY] [^1119mi5A].
- **Leukotriene modifiers**: Not recommended in acute management [^117UAZqk].
- **Antibiotics**: Not routine unless infection is confirmed [^116rnTG6] [^113fpqzA].

---

## Oxygen therapy

Titrate to **SpO2 93–95%** [^112VhsBR]; avoid hyperoxia, which can worsen hypercapnia [^notfound].

---

## Monitoring and reassessment

Continuous monitoring should include **pulse oximetry, respiratory rate, heart rate, and mental status**. Reassess lung function at 1 hour [^113d8vdw]; adjust therapy based on response [^112HE3BK].

---

## Indications for escalation

- **Noninvasive ventilation (NIV)**: Consider for severe respiratory distress or hypercapnia, but monitor closely and avoid in agitated patients [^113dVi6T].
- **Intubation**: Reserve for life-threatening features, altered mental status, or impending respiratory arrest [^notfound].

---

## Discharge planning and follow-up

- **Medications**: Prescribe ICS-containing therapy [^116RwoLR], short OCS course [^117JTinJ], and reliever inhaler [^112gXV5Y].
- **Education**: Review inhaler technique, adherence, and provide a written action plan [^112X2Ymh].
- **Follow-up**: Arrange within 2–7 days [^112gXV5Y]; step down ICS to pre-exacerbation dose after 2–4 weeks if stable [^116aFjD9].

---

## Special considerations

In pregnancy, **standard therapies are safe**; prioritize oxygen and corticosteroids. In pediatrics, use weight-based dosing and consider early ICS in the ED [^114dekQp]. In older adults, monitor closely for comorbidities and adverse effects [^notfound].

---

## Summary of key recommendations

- **SABA + early systemic corticosteroids**: Cornerstone of therapy [^116KTsTS] [^115sLYex].
- **Add ipratropium**: For moderate–severe cases [^117YNbRp].
- **IV magnesium**: For severe or refractory cases [^113scWj1].
- **Oxygen**: Titrate to SpO2 93–95% [^112VhsBR].
- **Discharge**: ICS-containing therapy, OCS, and close follow-up [^116RwoLR] [^117JTinJ] [^112gXV5Y].

---

Effective acute asthma care relies on **early bronchodilation, prompt corticosteroids, and judicious adjuncts**, with close monitoring and structured follow-up to reduce relapse and improve outcomes [^114yaAj6].

### Practical management of acute asthma in adults [^11575Y5q]. Respiratory Care (2002). Low credibility.

All asthma patients are at risk for acute asthma exacerbations. Moderate to severe exacerbations account for many emergency department visits and subsequent hospitalizations each year. Recent studies have advanced our understanding of the pathogenesis and treatment of acute asthma. The purpose of this review is to provide practical guidance in the assessment and treatment of adults with acute asthma in the hospital setting. Managing patients with acute asthma involves assessing the severity of the exacerbation, implementing measures to rapidly reverse airflow limitation, and instituting therapies that limit the progression of airway inflammation. Some patients may benefit from other supportive measures such as heliox and noninvasive ventilation. If the patient continues to deteriorate and requires mechanical ventilation, then ventilator settings that minimize the risk of hyperinflation should be chosen. After an episode of acute asthma, long-term preventive medications, especially inhaled corticosteroids, should be prescribed and education should be provided to prevent future episodes.

### Management of the acute exacerbation of asthma [^112GJqdU]. The Journal of Asthma (2003). Low credibility.

All patients with asthma are at risk of having asthma exacerbations characterized by worsening symptoms, airflow obstruction, and an increased requirement for rescue bronchodilators. The goals of managing an asthma exacerbation are prompt recognition and rapid reversal of airflow obstruction to avert relapses and future episodes. Short-acting beta-agonists, oxygen, and corticosteroids form the basis of management of acute asthma exacerbation, but a role is emerging for anticholinergics and newer agents such as levalbuterol and formoterol. Initiation or intensification of long-term controller therapy, treatment of comorbid conditions, avoidance of likely triggers, and timely follow-up care prevent setbacks. Acceptance of current treatment guidelines by physicians and adherence to the recommended clinical regimens by patients are essential for effective management of asthma. The physician should strive to establish a constructive relationship with the patient by addressing the patient's concerns, reaching agreement on the goals of therapy, and developing a written action plan for patient self-management.

### Asthma exacerbations: pathogenesis, prevention, and treatment [^115WE8dQ]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2017). Low credibility.

Guideline-based management of asthma focuses on disease severity and choosing the appropriate medical therapy to control symptoms and reduce the risk of exacerbations. However, irrespective of asthma severity and often despite optimal medical therapy, patients may experience acute exacerbations of symptoms and a loss of disease control. Asthma exacerbations are most commonly triggered by viral respiratory infections, particularly with human rhinovirus. Given the importance of these events to asthma morbidity and health care costs, we will review common inciting factors for asthma exacerbations and approaches to prevent and treat these events.

### Management of asthma exacerbations in the emergency department [^114yaAj6]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2021). Medium credibility.

Asthma exacerbations occur across a wide spectrum of chronic severity; they contribute to millions of emergency department (ED) visits in both children and adults every year. Management of asthma exacerbations is an important part of the continuum of asthma care. The best strategy for ED management of an asthma exacerbation is early recognition and intervention, continuous monitoring, appropriate disposition, and, once improved, multifaceted transitional care that optimizes subacute and chronic asthma management after ED discharge. This article concisely reviews ED evaluation, treatment, disposition, and postdischarge care for patients with asthma exacerbations, based on high-quality evidence (eg, systematic reviews from the Cochrane Collaboration) and current international guidelines (eg, the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program Expert Panel Report 3, Global Initiative for Asthma, and Australian guidelines). Special populations (young children, pregnant women, and the elderly) also are addressed. Despite advances in asthma science, there remain many important evidence gaps in managing ED patients with asthma exacerbation. This article summarizes several of these controversial areas and challenges that merit further investigation.

### Acute asthma, prognosis, and treatment [^1121MFNw]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2017). Low credibility.

Asthma affects about 300 million people globally and accounts for 1 in every 250 deaths in the world. Approximately 12 million people in the United States each year experience an acute exacerbation of their asthma, a quarter of which require hospitalization. Acute asthma should be differentiated from poor asthma control. Patients with acute asthma will exhibit increasing shortness of breath, chest tightness, coughing, and/or wheezing. In contrast, poor asthma control typically presents with a diurnal variability in airflow and is a characteristic that is usually not seen during an acute exacerbation. The history should include a review of comorbidities, adherence to medications, previous episodes of near-fatal asthma, and whether the patient has experienced multiple emergency department visits or hospitalizations, particularly those requiring admission to an intensive care unit involving respiratory failure, intubation, and mechanical ventilation. Patient education is important to ensure that the patient understands that asthma is mostly a chronic disease and necessitates the avoidance of allergens, prevention of infections, adherence with routine vaccinations, management of comorbid conditions, and adherence to treatment regimens. This article is a structured review of the available literature regarding the diagnosis and management of acute asthma.

### Mechanisms and management of asthma exacerbations [^116BXVwX]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Acute asthma remains an important medical emergency, the most frequent cause of acute admissions in children and a major source of morbidity for adults with asthma. In all ages with asthma, the presence of exacerbations is an important defining characteristic of asthma severity. In this review, we assess the epidemiology of acute asthma, the triggers of acute exacerbations, and the mechanisms that underlie these exacerbations. We also assess current treatments that prevent exacerbations, with an emphasis on the role of type 2 airway inflammation in the context of acute exacerbations and the novel treatments that effectively target this. Finally we review current management strategies of the exacerbations themselves.

### The patient with asthma in the emergency department [^112h47vp]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2012). Low credibility.

Asthma is a highly prevalent disease that presents commonly to the emergency department (ED) in acute exacerbation. Recent asthma treatment guidelines have added content dedicated to the management of acute exacerbations. Effective management of an exacerbation requires rapid assessment of severity through physical examination, measurement of peak expiratory flow rate, and response to initial treatment. Most therapies are directed at alleviating bronchospasm and decreasing airway inflammation. While inhaled short-acting beta-agonists, systemic corticosteroids, and supplemental oxygen are the initial and often only therapies required for patients with mild moderate exacerbations, high-dose beta agonists and inhaled anti-cholinergics should also be given to patients with severe exacerbations. Adjunctive therapy with intravenous magnesium and Heliox-driven nebulization of bronchodilators should be considered for patients presenting with severe and very severe exacerbations. Early recognition and appropriate management of respiratory failure are required to mitigate the risk of complications including death. Disposition should be determined based on serial assessments of the response to therapy over the first 4 h in the ED. Patients stable for discharge should receive medications, asthma education including a written asthma action plan, and should have follow-up scheduled for them by ED staff. Rapid implementation of evidence-based, multi-disciplinary care is required to ensure the best possible outcomes for this potentially treatable disease.

### Different oral corticosteroid regimens for acute asthma [^115paH13]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Asthma is a common long-term breathing condition that affects approximately 300 million people worldwide. People with asthma may experience short-term worsening of their asthma symptoms; these episodes are often known as 'exacerbations', 'flare-ups', 'attacks' or 'acute asthma'. Oral steroids, which have a potent anti-inflammatory effect, are recommended for all but the most mild asthma exacerbations; they should be initiated promptly. The most often prescribed oral steroids are prednisolone and dexamethasone, but current guidelines on dosing vary between countries, and often among different guideline producers within the same country. Despite their proven efficacy, use of steroids needs to be balanced against their potential to cause important adverse events. Evidence is somewhat limited regarding optimal dosing of oral steroids for asthma exacerbations to maximise recovery while minimising potential side effects, which is the topic of this review.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of any dose or duration of oral steroids versus any other dose or duration of oral steroids for adults and children with an asthma exacerbation.

Search Methods

We identified trials from the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register (CAGR), ClinicalTrials.gov (www. ClinicalTrials.gov), the World Health Organization (WHO) trials portal (www.who.int/ictrp/en/) and reference lists of all primary studies and review articles. This search was up to date as of April 2016.

Selection Criteria

We included parallel randomised controlled trials (RCTs), irrespective of blinding or duration, that evaluated one dose or duration of oral steroid versus any other dose or duration, for management of asthma exacerbations. We included studies involving both adults and children with asthma of any severity, in which investigators analysed adults and children separately. We allowed any other co-intervention in the management of an asthma exacerbation, provided it was not part of the randomised treatment. We included studies reported as full text, those published as abstract only and unpublished data.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened the search results for included trials, extracted numerical data and assessed risk of bias; all data were cross-checked for accuracy. We resolved disagreements by discussion with the third review author or with an external advisor. We analysed dichotomous data as odds ratios (ORs) or risk differences (RDs) using study participants as the unit of analysis; we analysed continuous data as mean differences (MDs). We used a random-effects model, and we carried out a fixed-effect analysis if we detected statistical heterogeneity. We rated all outcomes using the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) system and presented results in 'Summary of findings' tables.

Main Results

We included 18 studies that randomised a total of 2438 participants - both adults and children - and performed comparisons of interest. Included studies assessed higher versus lower doses of prednisolone (n = 4); longer versus shorter courses of prednisolone (n = 3) or dexamethasone (n = 1); tapered versus non-tapered courses of prednisolone (n = 4); and prednisolone versus dexamethasone (n = 6). Follow-up duration ranged from seven days to six months. The smallest study randomised just 15 participants, and the largest 638 (median 93). The varied interventions and outcomes reported limited the number of meaningful meta-analyses that we could perform. For two of our primary outcomes - hospital admission and serious adverse events - events were too infrequent to permit conclusions about the superiority of one treatment over the other, or their equivalence. Researchers in the included studies reported asthma symptoms in different ways and rarely used validated scales, again limiting our conclusions. Secondary outcome meta-analysis was similarly hampered by heterogeneity among interventions and outcome measures used. Overall, we found no convincing evidence of differences in outcomes between a higher dose or longer course and a lower dose or shorter course of prednisolone or dexamethasone, or between prednisolone and dexamethasone. Included studies were generally of reasonable methodological quality. Review authors assessed most outcomes in the review as having low or very low quality, meaning we are not confident in the effect estimates. The predominant reason for downgrading was imprecision, but indirectness and risk of bias also reduced our confidence in some estimates.

Authors' Conclusions

Evidence is not strong enough to reveal whether shorter or lower-dose regimens are generally less effective than longer or higher-dose regimens, or indeed that the latter are associated with more adverse events. Any changes recommended for current practice should be supported by data from larger, well-designed trials. Varied study design and outcome measures limited the number of meta-analyses that we could perform. Greater emphasis on palatability and on whether some regimens might be easier to adhere to than others could better inform clinical decisions for individual patients.

### Corticosteroid therapy for acute asthma [^112MC3M8]. Respiratory Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease, which is characterised by reversible airflow obstruction in response to a variety of stimuli. Exacerbations in response to airway irritants are part of the natural history of asthma, but often they also represent a failure in chronic treatment. Presentations to emergency departments and other acute care settings are common and frequently lead to hospitalisation and other complications. After treatment, however, most patients are discharged to the care of their primary care physician for further management. This review highlights the role of systemic and inhaled corticosteroids as mainstays of treatment in the acute and sub-acute phase of an exacerbation. These agents form the basis of most current clinical practice guidelines, yet their use is not universal. We will review the evidence for the use of these agents that arises from the Cochrane Collaboration of Systematic Reviews contained in the Cochrane Library.

Best Practice Advice 3: Recognize and support education and management plans addressing exacerbation risk for people with all severities of asthma

Asthma exacerbations can occur in all severities of asthma despite guideline-directed treatment. A history of ED visits or hospitalization for an exacerbation increase the risk of future exacerbations, irrespective of severity, patient demographics, or clinical characteristics. Patients with intermittent, mild, and moderate asthma are all at risk for exacerbations, which is often related to unrecognized lack of asthma control.

Recently in the US, approximately 60% of adults and 44% of children were reported to have uncontrolled asthma, with more than 80% of whom had mild or moderate asthma. In an international cohort of 1115 patients classified as GINA Step 1 or Step 2, 25% had uncontrolled asthma and about 33% reported rescue inhaler use in the previous 4 weeks. Based on United Kingdom data from the National Review of Asthma Deaths, up to 45% of patients across asthma severities dies without seeking medical assistance or before emergency care could be provided, indicating a need for improved education and management plans.

Appropriate and optimal therapy to minimize symptoms, exacerbations risk, and routine exacerbation assessment and history is important for all patients with asthma, regardless of severity.

### Core outcomes and factors influencing the experience of care for children with severe acute exacerbations of asthma: a qualitative study [^116jzaTQ]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Management of acute severe asthma exacerbations in children in the emergency department (ED) is complicated by a variety of possible treatment options, significant variation in practice, and little evidence to support the use of one particular medication over another. The Paediatric Emergency Research Networks (PERN) asthma working group was formed in 2017. It aims to gather the input of patients, families and clinicians to develop a global consensus on outcome measures and create international guidelines for the conduct and reporting of clinical trials of therapies for acute asthma exacerbations in children.

The currently available asthma literature does not include outcomes prioritised by patients and families, and little is known about what is important to them. Further, although asthma affects children across the globe, most research has been conducted in high-income countries. We conducted an international qualitative study to address this gap.

Qualitative methods are recommended to identify outcomes important to stakeholders, help understand why these outcomes are important and identify appropriate language to use when presenting these outcomes in later surveys. Our findings will inform the development of a planned Delphi survey, which aims to achieve consensus on a core outcome set (COS) of clinical trial measures for these patients.

The specific objectives of this study were to determine parent and caregiver opinions on: (1) the patient and family experience of treatment of an acute asthma exacerbation; (2) and which clinical outcomes are the most important to patients and families.

### Inpatient management of an acute asthma exacerbation using clinical care pathways [^116zNU66]. Current Problems in Pediatric and Adolescent Health Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Asthma exacerbations remain a leading cause of hospitalization in the pediatric population, and many children who require hospitalization for status asthmaticus are managed using clinical care pathways (CPGs). Clinical care pathways are often created or adopted by healthcare systems in order to establish specific, evidence-based guidelines that standardize and coordinate quality care in both the emergency room and inpatient settings. This paper reviews the use of these guidelines and the updated evidence-based recommendations regarding best-practice for acute asthma care of hospitalized children, including the 2020 recommendations from the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program Expert Panel (NAEPP).

Best Practice Advice 2: Counsel patients on the warning signs and symptoms of loss of asthma control that may precede exacerbations to facilitate initiation of timely and effective treatment to prevent exacerbations or reduce their severity

Counseling patient on warning signs such as an increase in their usual asthma symptoms or new onset of things such as cough that can precede exacerbations could prompt treatment with anti-inflammatory therapy, help mitigate exacerbation severity, and potentially prevent an exacerbation from occurring. Appropriate use of anti-inflammatory therapy (ICS) prior to an exacerbation may decrease use and overuse of health care resources such as the ED or urgent care, SABA and systemic corticosteroids (SCS).

Using an asthma action plan can give patients and families specific parameters for patients to take action in identifying and using early treatment for an exacerbation. Exacerbation triggers and how to address them should be identified.

While spirometry is the gold standard for diagnosing asthma it has limited practical value in exacerbation management. Peak expiratory flow (PEF) measurement can provide objective data on lung function for assessing exacerbation severity and response to treatment. However, frequency and severity of symptoms is a more practical and widely available measure of exacerbation onset and is more sensitive than PEF for most people. For those with poor perception of airflow limitation symptoms, regular PEF monitoring can help proactively identify exacerbation episodes.

About 10–14 days before an asthma exacerbation, progressively rising inflammation often underlies the decrease in lung function (PEF), accompanied by an increase in symptoms, which may result in patients increasing SABA use –. SABA use can provide symptomatic relief, but it does not address airway inflammation and overuse of SABA has been shown to increase risks. The timeframe leading up to an exacerbation may represent a "window of opportunity" to minimize airway inflammation and either prevent or reduce the exacerbation by adding anti-inflammatory therapy, if the patient is not using anti-inflammatory therapy, or scaling up the current anti-inflammatory dose.

GINA recommends the use of an anti-inflammatory reliever (AIR), which is low dose as-needed ICS-formoterol, or ICS-SABA for symptom control rather than SABA-only as a means to improve control and mitigate the risk of a serious exacerbation. Formoterol has the advantage of a fast and long-acting bronchodilator, while salbutamol (albuterol) is also fast but short-acting.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^1164RQb6]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Management of worsening asthma and exacerbations — adults, adolescents and children 6–11 years — terminology and written asthma action plans emphasize that exacerbations represent an acute or sub-acute worsening in symptoms and lung function, and that the term 'flare-up' is preferable for most patients; patients at increased risk of asthma-related death should be identified and flagged for more frequent review. All patients should be provided with a written asthma action plan appropriate for their age, current treatment, and reliever inhaler (short-acting beta2 agonist (SABA) or inhaled corticosteroids (ICS)-formoterol), with the plan stating when and how to change reliever and/or maintenance medications, use oral corticosteroids if needed, and access medical care if symptoms fail to respond; advise patients with a history of rapid deterioration to seek acute care or see their doctor immediately, and base the plan on changes in symptoms or (only in adults) peak expiratory flow (PEF).

### Management of asthma and COPD exacerbations in adults in the ICU [^114XWTeM]. CHEST Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Severe, life-threatening asthma and COPD exacerbations are managed commonly in the ICU and are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. It is important to understand the commonalities and differences in the diagnosis and management of these obstructive lung diseases to improve patient outcomes via evidence-based care. In this review, we first outline triggers of acute asthma and COPD exacerbations and an initial diagnostic evaluation and severity assessment. We then review the pathophysiologic features of asthma and COPD exacerbations and create a framework for the management of exacerbations in critically ill adult patients aimed at reducing airway inflammation, reversing bronchospasm, and, in severe cases, supporting patients with mechanical ventilation or advanced therapies until clinical improvement is achieved.

### Management of acute exacerbation of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in the emergency department [^111SBV4V]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Acute asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations are the most common respiratory diseases requiring emergent medical evaluation and treatment. Asthma and COPD are chronic, debilitating disease processes that have been differentiated traditionally by the presence or absence of reversible airflow obstruction. Asthma and COPD exacerbations impose an enormous economic burden on the US health care budget. In daily clinical practice, it is difficult to differentiate these 2 obstructive processes based on their symptoms, and on their nearly identical acute treatment strategies; major differences are important when discussing anatomic sites involved, long-term prognosis, and the nature of inflammatory markers.

### Acute asthma in adults: a review [^114WYiG4]. Chest (2004). Low credibility.

All patients with asthma are at risk of having exacerbations. Hospitalizations and emergency department (ED) visits account for a large proportion of the health-care cost burden of asthma, and avoidance or proper management of acute asthma (AA) episodes represent an area with the potential for large reductions in health-care costs. The severity of exacerbations may range from mild to life threatening, and mortality is most often associated with failure to appreciate the severity of the exacerbation, resulting in inadequate emergency treatment and delay in referring to hospital. This review describes the epidemiology, costs, pathophysiology, mortality, and management of adult AA in the ED and in the ICU.

### Interventions for escalation of therapy for acute exacerbations of asthma in children: an overview of cochrane reviews [^1119mi5A]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Asthma is an illness that commonly affects adults and children, and it serves as a common reason for children to attend emergency departments. An asthma exacerbation is characterised by acute or subacute worsening of shortness of breath, cough, wheezing, and chest tightness and may be triggered by viral respiratory infection, poor compliance with usual medication, a change in the weather, or exposure to allergens or irritants. Most children with asthma have mild or moderate exacerbations and respond well to first-line therapy (inhaled short-acting beta-agonists and systemic corticosteroids). However, the best treatment for the small proportion of seriously ill children who do not respond to first-line therapy is not well understood. Currently, a large number of treatment options are available and there is wide variation in management.

Objectives

Main objective - To summarise Cochrane Reviews with or without meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials on the efficacy and safety of second-line treatment for children with acute exacerbations of asthma (i.e. after first-line treatments, titrated oxygen delivery, and administration of intermittent inhaled short-acting beta 2 -agonists and oral corticosteroids have been tried and have failed) Secondary objectives - To identify gaps in the current evidence base that will inform recommendations for future research and subsequent Cochrane Reviews - To categorise information on reported outcome measures used in trials of escalation of treatment for acute exacerbations of asthma in children, and to make recommendations for development and reporting of standard outcomes in future trials and reviews - To identify relevant randomised controlled trials that have been published since the date of publication of each included review METHODS: We included Cochrane Reviews assessing interventions for children with acute exacerbations of asthma. We searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. The search is current to 28 December 2019. We also identified trials that were potentially eligible for, but were not currently included in, published reviews. We assessed the quality of included reviews using the ROBIS criteria (tool used to assess risk of bias in systematic reviews). We presented an evidence synthesis of data from reviews alongside an evidence map of clinical trials. Primary outcomes were length of stay, hospital admission, intensive care unit admission, and adverse effects. We summarised all findings in the text and reported data for each outcome in 'Additional tables'.

Main Results

We identified 17 potentially eligible Cochrane Reviews but extracted data from, and rated the quality of, 13 reviews that reported results for children alone. We excluded four reviews as one did not include any randomised controlled trials (RCTs), one did not provide subgroup data for children, and the last two had been updated and replaced by subsequent reviews. The 13 reviews included 67 trials; the number of trials in each review ranged from a single trial up to 27 trials. The vast majority of comparisons included between one and three trials, involving fewer than 100 participants. The total number of participants included in reviews ranged from 40 to 2630. All studies included children; 16 (24%) included children younger than two years of age. Most of the reviews reported search dates older than four years. We have summarised the published evidence as outlined in Cochrane Reviews. Key findings, in terms of our primary outcomes, are that (1) intravenous magnesium sulfate was the only intervention shown to reduce hospital length of stay (high-certainty evidence); (2) no evidence suggested that any intervention reduced the risk of intensive care admission (low- to very low-certainty evidence); (3) the risk of hospital admission was reduced by the addition of inhaled anticholinergic agents to inhaled beta 2 -agonists (moderate-certainty evidence), the use of intravenous magnesium sulfate (high-certainty evidence), and the use of inhaled heliox (low-certainty evidence); (4) the addition of inhaled magnesium sulfate to usual bronchodilator therapy appears to reduce serious adverse events during hospital admission (moderate-certainty evidence); (5) aminophylline increased vomiting compared to placebo (moderate-certainty evidence) and increased nausea and nausea/vomiting compared to intravenous beta 2 -agonists (low-certainty evidence); and (6) the addition of anticholinergic therapy to short-acting beta 2 -agonists appeared to reduce the risk of nausea (high-certainty evidence) and tremor (moderate-certainty evidence) but not vomiting (low-certainty evidence). We considered 4 of the 13 reviews to be at high risk of bias based on the ROBIS framework. In all cases, this was due to concerns regarding identification and selection of studies. The certainty of evidence varied widely (by review and also by outcome) and ranged from very low to high.

Authors' Conclusions

This overview provides the most up-to-date evidence on interventions for escalation of therapy for acute exacerbations of asthma in children from Cochrane Reviews of randomised controlled trials. A vast majority of comparisons involved between one and three trials and fewer than 100 participants, making it difficult to assess the balance between benefits and potential harms. Due to the lack of comparative studies between various treatment options, we are unable to make firm practice recommendations. Intravenous magnesium sulfate appears to reduce both hospital length of stay and the risk of hospital admission. Hospital admission is also reduced with the addition of inhaled anticholinergic agents to inhaled beta 2 -agonists. However, further research is required to determine which patients are most likely to benefit from these therapies. Due to the relatively rare incidence of acute severe paediatric asthma, multi-centre research will be required to generate high-quality evidence. A number of existing Cochrane Reviews should be updated, and we recommend that a new review be conducted on the use of high-flow nasal oxygen therapy. Important priorities include development of an internationally agreed core outcome set for future trials in acute severe asthma exacerbations and determination of clinically important differences in these outcomes, which can then inform adequately powered future trials.

### Acute asthma exacerbations: management strategies [^115sLYex]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Asthma exacerbations, defined as a deterioration in baseline symptoms or lung function, cause significant morbidity and mortality. Asthma action plans help patients triage and manage symptoms at home. In patients 12 years and older, home management includes an inhaled corticosteroid/formoterol combination for those who are not using an inhaled corticosteroid/long-acting beta2 agonist inhaler for maintenance, or a short-acting beta2 agonist for those using an inhaled corticosteroid/long-acting beta2 agonist inhaler that does not include formoterol. In children four to 11 years of age, an inhaled corticosteroid/formoterol inhaler, up to eight puffs daily, can be used to reduce the risk of exacerbations and need for oral corticosteroids. In the office setting, it is important to assess exacerbation severity and begin a short-acting beta2 agonist and oxygen to maintain oxygen saturations, with repeated doses of the short-acting beta2 agonist every 20 minutes for one hour and oral corticosteroids. Patients with severe exacerbations should be transferred to an acute care facility and treated with oxygen, frequent administration of a short-acting beta2 agonist, and corticosteroids. The addition of a short-acting muscarinic antagonist and magnesium sulfate infusion has been associated with fewer hospitalizations. Patients needing admission to the hospital require continued monitoring and systemic therapy similar to treatments used in the emergency department. Improvement in symptoms and forced expiratory volume in one second or peak expiratory flow to 60% to 80% of predicted values helps determine appropriateness for discharge. The addition of inhaled corticosteroids, consideration of stepping up asthma maintenance therapy, close follow-up, and education on asthma action plans are important next steps to prevent future exacerbations.

Asthma is a chronic inflammatory illness with acute exacerbations, which often is encountered in the ED setting. Knowledge of the presentation and treatment of asthma is crucial for any physician treating patients with this disease. Beta-agonist, anticholinergic, and corticosteroid therapy continue to be the mainstay of emergency therapy despite advances in newer medications. Proper attention to long-term treatment of asthma and aggressive treatment of acute exacerbations should help reduce morbidity and mortality.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^112MfK2d]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Diagnosis of exacerbations — exacerbations represent a change in symptoms and lung function from the patient's usual status, and the decrease in expiratory airflow can be quantified by lung function measurements such as PEF or forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), compared with the patient's previous lung function or predicted values; in the acute setting, these measurements are more reliable indicators of the severity of the exacerbation than symptoms, although the frequency of symptoms may be a more sensitive measure of the onset of an exacerbation than PEF; consider the possibility of pertussis in a patient with an atypical exacerbation presentation, with predominant cough; a minority of patients perceive airflow limitation poorly and can experience a significant decline in lung function without a change in symptoms, especially affecting patients with a history of near-fatal asthma and appearing to be more common in males, and regular PEF monitoring may be considered for such patients; severe exacerbations are potentially life-threatening and require careful assessment and close monitoring, and patients with severe exacerbations should be advised to see their healthcare provider promptly or to proceed to the nearest facility that provides emergency access for patients with acute asthma.

### Acute asthma [^115ykJrg]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

OBJECTIVE: Asthma is the most common medical emergency in children. It is associated with significant morbidity and mortality rates and poses a tremendous societal burden worldwide. Management of the acute attack involves a stepwise approach that includes beta-agonist and steroid therapy, the mainstay of emergency treatment. Most patients will respond to this regime and can be discharged from the emergency department. Failure to respond to treatment necessitates hospital admission and sometimes admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). Management in the ICU involves intensification of pharmacologic therapy, including nonstandard therapies, in an attempt to avoid intubation and ventilation. When needed, mechanical ventilatory support can be rendered fairly safe with little morbidity if the likely cardiorespiratory physiologic derangements are appreciated and if appropriate ventilatory strategies are used. In the past two decades, the availability of newer potent medications and changes in approach to monitoring and ventilatory strategies have resulted in a decrease in ICU morbidity and mortality rates. Research endeavors are presently underway to further characterize the underlying mechanisms of the disease and are likely to lead to novel therapies. This article reviews the approach to management of acute severe asthma.

### Asthma update [^112whHmD]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Asthma continues to be one of the most common reasons for emergency department visits and a leading cause of hospitalization. Acute management involves severity-based treatment of bronchoconstriction and underlying airway inflammation. Optimal treatment has been defined and standardized through randomized controlled trials, systematic reviews, and consensus guidelines. Implementation of clinical practice guidelines may improve clinical, quality, and safety outcomes. Asthma morbidity is disproportionately high in poor, urban, and minority children. Children treated in emergency departments commonly have persistent chronic severity, significant morbidity, and infrequent follow-up and primary asthma care, and prescription of inhaled corticosteroids is appropriate.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^112HE3BK]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Reviewing response during treatment for an exacerbation: During treatment, patients should be closely monitored, and treatment titrated according to their response. Patients who present with signs of a severe or life-threatening exacerbation, who fail to respond to treatment, or who continue to deteriorate should be transferred immediately to an acute care facility, and those with little or slow response to SABA treatment should be closely monitored. For many patients, lung function can be monitored after SABA therapy is repeated, and additional treatment should continue until PEF or FEV1 reaches a plateau or ideally returns to the patient's previous best, after which a decision can be made whether to send the patient home or transfer them to an acute care facility.

### Increased versus stable doses of inhaled corticosteroids for exacerbations of chronic asthma in adults and children [^115mUwa7]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

People with asthma may experience exacerbations, or 'attacks', during which their symptoms worsen and additional treatment is required. Written action plans sometimes advocate a short-term increase in the dose of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) at the first sign of an exacerbation to reduce the severity of the attack and to prevent the need for oral steroids or hospital admission.

Objectives

To compare the clinical effectiveness and safety of increased versus stable doses of ICS as part of a patient-initiated action plan for the home management of exacerbations in children and adults with persistent asthma.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register, which is derived from searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature), and handsearched abstracts to 20 December 2021. We also searched major trial registries for ongoing trials.

Selection Criteria

We included parallel and cross-over randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that allocated people with persistent asthma to take a blinded inhaler in the event of an exacerbation which either increased their daily dose of ICS or kept it stable (placebo).

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected trials, assessed quality, and extracted data. We reassessed risk of bias for all studies at the result level using the revised risk of bias tool for RCTs (Risk of Bias 2), and employed the GRADE approach to assess our confidence in the synthesised effect estimates. The primary outcome was treatment failure, defined as the need for rescue oral steroids in the randomised population. Secondary outcomes were treatment failure in the subset who initiated the study inhaler (treated population), unscheduled physician visits, unscheduled acute care, emergency department or hospital visits, serious and non-serious adverse events, and duration of exacerbation.

Main Results

This review update added a new study that increased the number of people in the primary analysis from 1520 to 1774, and incorporates the most up-to-date methods to assess the likely impact of bias within the meta-analyses. The updated review now includes nine RCTs (1923 participants; seven parallel and two cross-over) conducted in Europe, North America, and Australasia and published between 1998 and 2018. Five studies evaluated adult populations (n = 1247; ≥ 15 years), and four studies evaluated child or adolescent populations (n = 676; < 15 years). All study participants had mild to moderate asthma. Studies varied in the dose of maintenance ICS, age, fold increase of ICS in the event of an exacerbation, criteria for initiating the study inhaler, and allowed medications. Approximately 50% of randomised participants initiated the study inhaler (range 23% to 100%), and the included studies reported treatment failure in a variety of ways, meaning assumptions were required to permit the combining of data. Participants randomised to increase their ICS dose at the first signs of an exacerbation had similar odds of needing rescue oral corticosteroids to those randomised to a placebo inhaler (odds ratio (OR) 0.97, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.76 to 1.25; 8 studies; 1774 participants; I² = 0%; moderate quality evidence). We could draw no firm conclusions from subgroup analyses conducted to investigate the impact of age, time to treatment initiation, baseline dose, smoking history, and fold increase of ICS on the primary outcome. Results for the same outcome in the subset of participants who initiated the study inhaler were unchanged from the previous version, which provides a different point estimate with very low confidence due to heterogeneity, imprecision, and risk of bias (OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.30; 7 studies; 766 participants; I² = 42%; random-effects model). Confidence was reduced due to risk of bias and assumptions that had to be made to include study data in the intention-to-treat and treated-population analyses. Sensitivity analyses that tested the impact of assumptions made for synthesis and to exclude cross-over studies, studies at overall high risk of bias, and those with commercial funding did not change our conclusions. Pooled effects for unscheduled physician visits, unscheduled acute care, emergency department or hospital visits, and duration of exacerbation made it very difficult to determine where the true effect may lie, and confidence was reduced by risk of bias. Point estimates for both serious and non-serious adverse events favoured keeping ICS stable, but imprecision and risk of bias due to missing data and outcome measurement and reporting reduced our confidence in the effects (serious adverse events: OR 1.69, 95% CI 0.77 to 3.71; 2 studies; 394 participants; I² = 0%; non-serious adverse events: OR 2.15, 95% CI 0.68 to 6.73; 2 studies; 142 participants; I² = 0%).

Authors' Conclusions

Evidence from double-blind trials of adults and children with mild to moderate asthma suggests there is unlikely to be an important reduction in the need for oral steroids from increasing a patient's ICS dose at the first sign of an exacerbation. Other clinically important benefits and potential harms of increased doses of ICS compared with keeping the dose stable cannot be ruled out due to wide confidence intervals, risk of bias in the trials, and assumptions that had to be made for synthesis. Included studies conducted between 1998 and 2018 reflect evolving clinical practice and study methods, and the data do not support thorough investigation of effect modifiers such as baseline dose, fold increase, asthma severity and timing. The review does not include recent evidence from pragmatic, unblinded studies showing benefits of larger dose increases in those with poorly controlled asthma. A systematic review is warranted to examine the differences between the blinded and unblinded trials using robust methods for assessing risk of bias to present the most complete view of the evidence for decision makers.

### Management of acute asthma exacerbations [^113juTH7]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Asthma exacerbations can be classified as mild, moderate, severe, or life threatening. Criteria for exacerbation severity are based on symptoms and physical examination parameters, as well as lung function and oxygen saturation. In patients with a peak expiratory flow of 50 to 79 percent of their personal best, up to two treatments of two to six inhalations of short-acting beta2 agonists 20 minutes apart followed by a reassessment of peak expiratory flow and symptoms may be safely employed at home. Administration using a hand-held metered-dose inhaler with a spacer device is at least equivalent to nebulized beta2 agonist therapy in children and adults. In the ambulatory and emergency department settings, the goals of treatment are correction of severe hypoxemia, rapid reversal of airflow obstruction, and reduction of the risk of relapse. Multiple doses of inhaled anticholinergic medication combined with beta2 agonists improve lung function and decrease hospitalization in school-age children with severe asthma exacerbations. Intravenous magnesium sulfate has been shown to significantly increase lung function and decrease the necessity of hospitalization in children. The administration of systemic corticosteroids within one hour of emergency department presentation decreases the need for hospitalization, with the most pronounced effect in patients with severe exacerbations. Airway inflammation can persist for days to weeks after an acute attack; therefore, more intensive treatment should be continued after discharge until symptoms and peak expiratory flow return to baseline.

### Acute severe asthma: recent advances [^113mjD3j]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Acute severe asthma is challenging to the clinician both in terms of recognition and appropriate treatment. About 30% of these episodes need admission to the medical intensive care unit with a mortality of 8%. Relapse rates vary from 7 to 15% depending on how well the patient is managed. The purpose of this review is to discuss recent advances in identification of risk factors, pathophysiology and management of acute severe asthma.

Recent Findings

Although the exact mechanism for acute severe asthma is unclear, some that are implicated include inflammation, airway remodeling and downregulation of beta-receptors. None of the environmental factors have been clearly related to the development of near fatal attacks. Genetic polymorphisms have been associated with severe asthma. Lack of steroid responsiveness has been linked to severe asthma attacks. Chemokines and basement membrane changes characteristic of severe asthma are reported in a few studies. Lack of symptom perception in a certain group of patients with acute severe asthma leads to delayed interventions. Specific treatment modalities and ventilator management is reviewed.

Summary

Severe asthma is a phenotype of asthma with variable pathology and clinical presentation. Early recognition and timely intervention is needed to prevent significant mortality and morbidity.

Asthma exacerbation follow-up and referral — after an exacerbation, the written asthma action plan should be reviewed, and maintenance asthma treatment can generally be reduced to previous levels 2–4 weeks after the exacerbation unless the history suggests long-term poorly controlled asthma, in which case a step up in treatment may be indicated. Patients with more than 1–2 exacerbations per year despite Step 4–5 therapy (or Step 4 therapy in children 6–11 years), or with several emergency department visits, should be referred to a specialist center, if available, for assessment and strategies to reduce their risk of future exacerbations and their risk of exposure to OCS.

### Asthma in adults [^111xj3A3]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2010). Medium credibility.

Introduction

About 10% of adults have suffered an attack of asthma, and up to 5% of these have severe disease that responds poorly to treatment. Patients with severe disease have an increased risk of death, but patients with mild-to-moderate disease are also at risk of exacerbations. Most guidelines about the management of asthma follow stepwise protocols. This review does not endorse or follow any particular protocol, but presents the evidence about specific interventions.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of treatments for chronic asthma? What are the effects of treatments for acute asthma? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to June 2008 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 99 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions. For acute asthma: beta(2) agonists (plus ipratropium bromide, pressured metered-dose inhalers, short-acting continuous nebulised, short-acting intermittent nebulised, and short-acting intravenous); corticosteroids (inhaled); corticosteroids (single oral, combined inhaled, and short courses); education about acute asthma; generalist care; helium-oxygen mixture (heliox); magnesium sulphate (intravenous and adding isotonic nebulised magnesium to inhaled beta(2) agonists); mechanical ventilation; oxygen supplementation (controlled 28% oxygen and controlled 100% oxygen); and specialist care. For chronic asthma: beta(2) agonists (adding long-acting inhaled beta(2) agonists when asthma is poorly controlled by inhaled corticosteroids, or short-acting inhaled beta(2) agonists as needed for symptom relief); inhaled corticosteroids (low dose and increasing dose); leukotriene antagonists (with or without inhaled corticosteroids); and theophylline (when poorly controlled by inhaled corticosteroids).

### Pediatric acute asthma exacerbations: evaluation and management from emergency department to intensive care unit [^112GBa4E]. The Journal of Asthma (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

The goal of this report is to review available modalities for assessing and managing acute asthma exacerbations in pediatric patients, including some that are not included in current expert panel guidelines. While it is not our purpose to provide a comprehensive review of the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (NAEPP) guidelines, we review NAEPP-recommended treatments to provide the full range of treatments available for managing exacerbations with an emphasis on the continuum of care between the ER and ICU.

Data Sources

We searched PubMed using the following search terms in different combinations: asthma, children, pediatric, exacerbation, epidemiology, pathophysiology, guidelines, treatment, management, oxygen, albuterol, β2-agonist, anticholinergic, theophylline, corticosteroid, magnesium, heliox, BiPAP, ventilation, mechanical ventilation, non-invasive mechanical ventilation and respiratory failure. We attempted to weigh the evidence using the hierarchy in which meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) provide the strongest evidence, followed by individual RCTs, followed by observational studies. We also reviewed the NAEPP and Global Initiative for Asthma expert panel guidelines.

Results and Conclusions

Asthma is the most common chronic disease of childhood, and acute exacerbations are a significant burden to patients and to public health. Optimal assessment and management of exacerbations, including appropriate escalation of interventions, are essential to minimize morbidity and prevent mortality. While inhaled albuterol and systemic corticosteroids are the mainstay of exacerbation management, escalation may include interventions discussed in this review.

Asthma exacerbation terminology — the academic term 'exacerbation' is commonly used in scientific and clinical literature, although hospital-based studies more often refer to 'acute severe asthma'; however, the term 'exacerbation' is not suitable for use in clinical practice as it is difficult for many patients to pronounce and remember; the term 'flare-up' is simpler and conveys the sense that asthma is present even when symptoms are absent; the term 'attack' is used by many patients and healthcare providers but with widely varying meanings and may not be perceived as including gradual worsening; and in pediatric literature the term 'episode' is commonly used, but understanding of this term by parent/caregivers is not known.

### Medication regimens for managing acute asthma [^113nFGzY]. Respiratory Care (2018). Low credibility.

Asthma exacerbation is defined as a progressive increase in symptoms of shortness of breath, cough, or wheezing sufficient to require a change in therapy. After ruling out diagnoses that mimic an asthma exacerbation, therapy should be initiated. Short-acting β 2 agonists and short-acting muscarinic antagonists are effective as bronchodilators for asthma in the acute setting. Systemic corticosteroids to reduce airway inflammation continue to be the mainstay therapy for asthma exacerbations, and, unless there is a contraindication, the oral route is favored. Based on the current evidence, nebulized magnesium should not be routinely used in acute asthma. The evidence favors the use of intravenous magnesium sulfate in selected cases, particularly in severe exacerbations. Methylxanthines have a minimum role as therapy for asthma exacerbations but may be considered in refractory cases of status asthmaticus with careful monitoring of toxicity. Current guidelines recommend the use of helium-oxygen mixtures in patients who do not respond to standard therapies or those with severe disease.

### Asthma in adults (acute) [^115ydVhU]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2011). Medium credibility.

Introduction

About 10% of adults have suffered an attack of asthma, and up to 5% of these have severe disease that responds poorly to treatment. Patients with severe disease have an increased risk of death, but patients with mild to moderate disease are also at risk of exacerbations. Most guidelines about the management of asthma follow stepwise protocols. This review does not endorse or follow any particular protocol, but presents the evidence about specific interventions.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of treatments for acute asthma? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to April 2010 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 100 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: beta(2) agonists (plus ipratropium bromide, pressured metered-dose inhalers, short-acting continuous nebulised, short-acting intermittent nebulised, short-acting iv, and inhaled formoterol); corticosteroids (inhaled); corticosteroids (single oral, combined inhaled, and short courses); education about acute asthma; generalist care; helium-oxygen mixture (heliox); magnesium sulphate (iv and adding isotonic nebulised magnesium to inhaled beta(2) agonists); mechanical ventilation; oxygen supplementation (controlled 28% oxygen and controlled 100% oxygen); and specialist care.

### Systemic corticosteroid therapy for acute asthma exacerbations [^116LH4cE]. The Journal of Asthma (2006). Low credibility.

Acute exacerbations of asthma may represent reactions to airway irritants or failures of chronic treatment. The costs to both the patient and society are high. Exacerbations often are frightening episodes that can cause significant morbidity and sometimes death. The emergency department (ED) visits and hospitalizations often required lead to significant health care expenses. Thus, preventing and optimizing management of acute exacerbations is critical. Corticosteroids are a cornerstone of asthma therapy. They have been shown to lower admission rates and reduce risk of relapse. This article provides an overview of the role of corticosteroids (including betamethasone, dexamethasone, methylprednisolone, and prednisolone) in the management of acute asthma exacerbations, with an aim toward effective decision making about the choice of therapy.

### The acute management of asthma [^1158sEkS]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2015). Low credibility.

Patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) or clinic with acute exacerbation of asthma (AEA) can be very challenging varying in both severity and response to therapy. High-dose, frequent or continuous nebulized short-acting beta2 agonist (SABA) therapy that can be combined with a short-acting muscarinic antagonist (SAMA) is the backbone of treatment. When patients do not rapidly clinically respond to SABA/SAMA inhalation, the early use of oral or parenteral corticosteroids should be considered and has been shown to impact the immediate need for ICU admission or even the need for hospital admission. Adjunctive therapies such as the use of intravenous magnesium and helium/oxygen combination gas for inhalation and for driving a nebulizer to deliver a SABA and or SAMA should be considered and are best used early in the treatment plan if they are likely to impact the patients' clinical course. The use of other agents such as theophylline, leukotriene modifiers, inhaled corticosteroids, long-acting beta2 agonist, and long-acting muscarinic antagonist currently does not play a major role in the immediate treatment of AEA in the clinic or the ED but is an important therapeutic option for physicians to be aware of and to consider initiating at the time of discharge from clinic, hospital, or ED to reduce later clinical worsening and readmission to the ED and hospital. A comprehensive summary is provided of the currently available respiratory pharmaceuticals approved for asthma and other airway syndromes. Clinicians must be prepared to use the entire spectrum of medications available for the treatment of acute asthma exacerbations and the agents that should be initiated to prevent worsening or additional exacerbations. They need to be familiar with the major potential drug toxicities associated with their use.

### The GINA asthma strategy report: what's new for primary care? [^112Npigm]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

9. A continuum of care for worsening asthma, from early self-management, through to primary-care and acute-care management

The GINA report now includes several new tools: an evidence table summarising pharmacological options for written asthma action plans, flow charts for assessment and management of exacerbations in primary care and acute care, and a summary of key issues to be addressed during re-assessment and ongoing management after any exacerbation. Every patient should have an individualised written asthma action plan. The report provides the rationale for key new recommendations including an early increase in inhaled corticosteroid dose in written asthma action plans (unlike previous guidelines that have recommended only bronchodilator treatment and oral corticosteroids); initiation of regular inhaled corticosteroid-based treatment after any exacerbation requiring oral corticosteroids, or its resumption if the patient was previously non-adherent, and, for severe exacerbations, use of controlled-flow oxygen with a target saturation for adults of 93–95%, rather than high-flow oxygen. GINA now recommends the term 'flare-up' for communication with patients, as it is simpler and less ambiguous than 'exacerbation' or 'attack', and it reinforces the crucial message that asthma is associated with inflammation and is present even when symptoms are absent.

10. A new approach to diagnosing asthma in children 5 years and younger

Previous classifications of wheezing phenotypes (episodic wheeze/multiple-trigger wheeze; or transient wheeze/persistent wheeze/late-onset wheeze) have not been found to be stable, and are no longer recommended. Instead, GINA recommends that a probability-based approach should be taken to the diagnosis of asthma in preschool children, taking into account the pattern, frequency and severity of symptoms; the diagnosis should be reviewed as the child grows older. Assessment of asthma control in this age group, as in adults, should include both current symptom control and assessment of risk factors for future adverse outcomes such as exacerbations; a trial of controller therapy should be given if the symptom pattern suggests asthma, if respiratory symptoms are uncontrolled and/or if wheezing episodes are frequent or severe. The aim is to reduce the risk of future severe exacerbations, even if symptoms are currently well controlled, and to minimise the impact of uncontrolled asthma on schooling and physical and social development.

### Best practice advice for asthma exacerbation prevention and management in primary care: an international expert consensus [^114HuCD1]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Actively Address Asthma Exacerbation Management and Prevention

Best Practice Advice 5: Recognize the cumulative adverse effects of systemic corticosteroids (SCS) use and work to avoid their overuse by preventing future exacerbations

While some asthma exacerbations may require SCS, earlier recognition and use of ICS with SABA or fast-acting LABA for quick relief or early in an exacerbation may mitigate the need for SCS. Rarely, if ever, are SCS required for effective maintenance management, and their use should be minimized where possible due to potential short-term and long-term adverse effects.

Adverse effects resulting from SCS use occur based on cumulative lifetime dose, starting at doses as low as 500 mg of prednisone or equivalent and less than 30 days of exposure. Adverse effects of SCS can occur with both chronic and repeated episodic use with cumulative doses ≥ 1000 mg of prednisone equivalent per year, regardless of the length of treatment. A common regimen for exacerbation management is prednisone (or equivalent) 40–60 mg for 5–10 days, adding up to a cumulative dose of 200–600 mg per exacerbation, approaching or exceeding the long-term effect risk threshold after even a single course of SCS. Higher cumulative SCS doses are associated with increases in cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, fractures, cerebrovascular disease, pneumonia, kidney impairment, cataracts, sleep apnea, depression, anxiety, type 2 diabetes, and weight gain –.

To limit the use of SCS, PCCs can implement asthma treatment that appropriately uses ICS-based therapies in both acute and maintenance regimens, thereby reducing the risk of exacerbations and the need for SCS. PCCs should include monitoring patients for adverse effects of corticosteroids, especially among those with multiple courses of SCS therapy over the years of their asthma care.

### Treatment strategies for reducing asthma-related emergency department visits [^116FAZz5]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Acute asthma exacerbations reflect inadequate long-term disease control. Treatment to control acute asthma exacerbations includes: 1) rapid reversal of airflow obstruction with bronchodilators and systemic corticosteroids and reversing hypoxemia with oxygen in the emergency department (ED); 2) preventing early relapse by prescribing beta(2) agonists and oral corticosteroids at discharge and ensuring patients have an adequate supply of their other asthma medications; and 3) preventing future asthma exacerbations and ED visits through effective treatment in primary care. This article discusses each treatment and reviews the role of emergency physicians in treating patients to reverse airflow obstruction and prevent early relapse, future exacerbations, and ED visits by communicating the need for additional asthma control to patients' primary care physicians.

Asthma outcomes and GRADE/EtD methodology — The Expert Panel used the GRADE framework to review evidence, create evidence profiles, develop EtD tables, and write recommendation statements, and across all topic areas the outcomes deemed critical were asthma exacerbations, asthma control, and asthma-related quality of life, with additional outcomes assessed when data for the three critical outcomes were not available. The panel established thresholds for minimally important difference (MID) for asthma control and asthma-related quality-of-life measures and, where no MID existed (such as exacerbations), reached consensus on clinically important differences based in part on RCT effect sizes and their judgments; core exacerbation measures included treatment with systemic corticosteroids, asthma-specific emergency department visits, and hospitalizations. Topic teams developed EtD tables for each key question using evidence from the systematic review reports, and new articles found in updated literature reviews were noted in EtD new-evidence sections but not incorporated into pooled estimates.

### Management of asthma and COPD exacerbations in adults in the ICU [^11241dzt]. CHEST Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Asthma and COPD are the most common chronic respiratory diseases in the world, affecting approximately 20 million and 14 million US adults, respectively. – Each year, hundreds of thousands of asthma and COPD exacerbations require hospitalization, of which an estimated 10% to 19% are managed in the ICU. Severe exacerbations requiring the ICU are associated with significant morbidity and mortality, with rates as high as 25% to 30% among patients with COPD. – Despite being distinct diseases, overlap exists regarding pathophysiologic features, presentation of acute exacerbations, and management of asthma and COPD among adult patients who are critically ill. This CHEST Critical Care Review examines the diagnosis and management of patients who are critically ill with these common conditions.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^112X2Ymh]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Asthma post–emergency department or hospitalization follow-up — Patients discharged following an emergency department presentation or hospitalization for asthma should be especially targeted for an asthma education program, if one is available, and healthcare providers should take the opportunity to review the patient's understanding of the cause of their asthma exacerbation, modifiable risk factors for exacerbations (including, where relevant, smoking), the patient's understanding of the purposes and correct uses of medications including ICS-containing maintenance treatment and anti-inflammatory reliever, if prescribed, and the actions the patient needs to take to respond to worsening symptoms or peak flows. After an emergency department presentation, comprehensive intervention programs that include optimization of asthma treatment, inhaler technique, and elements of self-management education are cost effective and have shown significant improvement in asthma outcomes (Evidence B). Referral for expert advice should be considered for patients who have been hospitalized for asthma, or who have had several presentations to an acute care setting despite having a primary care provider, and follow-up by a specialist is associated with fewer subsequent emergency department visits or hospitalizations and better asthma control.

### Optimising long-term management in acute asthma presentations to the emergency department: an interview study on patient beliefs [^116sh7mi]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2025). High credibility.

Abstract

Background

Emergency department (ED) attendances with acute asthma are an opportunity for simple medication changes to improve long-term self-management, but patients' beliefs and behaviours need to be considered for interventions to be successful. We explored the health beliefs and behaviours of adult patients who have presented to the ED with asthma and considered their attitudes to ED-based interventions designed to improve long-term asthma control.

Methods

19 semi-structured face-to-face or online patient interviews were conducted in 2021/2022. Eligible participants were patients over age 16 who had attended and were discharged from the ED with an asthma exacerbation. Purposive sampling was undertaken to ensure representation of patients of different ages, ethnicity and gender. Interviews were analysed with reflective thematic analysis.

Results

Themes that reflected the beliefs and behaviours of the patients were: (1) experiences of an asthma exacerbation — the emotional response and self-management during an episode; (2) discharge dilemma — expectations and communication on discharge from ED, impacted by time, language and capacity in the acute environment; (3) do what is best for me — openness to change such as of medication, if rationale and support is provided; and (4) perceptions of asthma medication — reliance on salbutamol, concerns about inhaled corticosteroids, openness to maintenance and reliever therapy inhalers and device preferences.

Conclusion

Patients do not expect longer-term care to be provided in the ED. However, patients trust healthcare professionals to recommend appropriate treatment and are willing to accept a change in medication or inhaler device in this context.

### Definition of critical asthma syndromes [^1111NGFd]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2015). Low credibility.

Urgent visits to the clinic and emergency department for acute severe asthma exacerbations are all too frequent. Existing national guidelines do not present consistent or specific recommendations for the evaluation and treatment of individual asthma patients in respiratory distress. In this vein, we propose the term "critical asthma syndrome" (CAS) to describe any child or adult who is at high risk for fatal asthma. Acute severe asthma, refractory asthma, status asthmaticus, and near-fatal asthma all describe CAS where physical exhaustion from the overwhelming work of breathing leads to respiratory arrest and death from hypoxia or related complications. The authors of this supplement seek to emphasize the importance of early recognition, prompt and coordinated evaluation, and treatment of CAS in the emergency department, hospital, and intensive care units by experienced healthcare provider teams. CAS is not severe persistent asthma where control of symptoms and prevention of exacerbations are targets of chronic disease management in the outpatient setting. The authors address the distinctions between the two entities throughout the supplement, and elaborate on the considerations important in the care of a critically ill patient, including the common errors to avoid. In addition, gaps in knowledge and clinical experience in regards to critical asthma are highlighted. Knowledge gaps include a lack of understanding of how to recognize CAS, how to coordinate and integrate hospital and outpatient resources, when to further phenotype patients with critical asthma in order to facilitate effective treatment, and how to prevent future acute exacerbations. Lastly, CAS is complicated by the fact that asthma care in diverse healthcare settings is haphazard. We recommend that primary care physicians refer patients promptly to an asthma specialist for consultation to reduce the frequency of acute exacerbations and prevent the development of CAS.

### Are acute asthma presentations to the emergency department an opportunity for optimising long-term management? A qualitative study on beliefs and behaviours of healthcare professionals [^111QvBFb]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

HCPs recognised the ED as a place in which patients increasingly seek help for the management of long-term conditions. Despite some disagreement on whether the ED should have a role in chronic disease management, and concerns about capacity in the system, emergency healthcare providers felt that it would be feasible to prescribe more optimum inhaled therapy in some instances. ED professionals wanted to follow guidelines and training to ensure action taken was in the best interests of the patients. Implementation would require good communication between primary care and the ED, and resources within the ED to add this practice change.

### It is time to change the way we manage mild asthma: an update in GINA 2019 [^114nKDjP]. Respiratory Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Asthma is a heterogeneous lung disease, usually characterised by chronic airway inflammation. Asthma poses a significant level of morbidity and mortality globally. Although evidence-based treatments are available in most countries, asthma control remains suboptimal, and asthma-related deaths continue to be an ongoing concern. Generally, it is believed that between 50 to 75% of patients with asthma can be considered as having mild asthma. Although the symptoms may not be very troublesome or frequent, airway inflammation is usually present in those with mild asthma and patients may be at risk of acute asthma exacerbations and death. An expert review estimated that the frequency of severe exacerbations in mild asthma ranged between 0.12 to 0.77 per patient-year. Further, the review highlighted that between 30 and 40% of exacerbations requiring emergency care appear to be in patients with mild asthma. In general, asthma exacerbations impose a significant disease burden, including hospitalisation, a greater progressive decline in lung function, impairment in quality of life (QoL) and death. Moreover, asthma patients with exacerbations requiring an emergency department visit or hospitalisation are at increased risk for future exacerbations, independent of demographic, clinical factors, asthma severity and asthma control. Asthma exacerbations also have been shown to cause a significant financial burden on health systems. For example, in a US study which retrospectively analysed administrative claims data, asthma patients who experienced exacerbations had nearly twice the health care and asthma specific costs compared with patients without exacerbations. Preventing the risk of future exacerbations is, therefore, an important target, particularly in patients with mild asthma, where there may be complacence both by the patient or their health professionals.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^111EpqPw]. GINA (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for asthma, more specifically with respect to management of exacerbation, primary care setting (monitoring and discharge), GINA 2025 guidelines recommend to include regular maintenance ICS-containing treatment, as-needed reliever medication (low-dose ICS-formoterol, ICS-short-acting β-agonist, or short-acting β-agonist), and a short course of oral corticosteroids in the discharge medications. Do not prescribe short-acting β-agonist-only treatment. Review inhaler technique and adherence before discharge. Advise patients to use their reliever inhaler only as needed rather than routinely. Schedule a follow-up appointment for 2–7 days later, depending on the clinical and social context.

### Factors associated with relapse in adult patients discharged from the emergency department following acute asthma: a systematic review [^113zSdTK]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2017). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Asthma affects over 17.5 million adults in North America and its prevalence continues to rise, as evidenced by the 12.3% relative increase from 2001 (7.3%) to 2009 (8.2%). Worldwide, asthma prevalence ranges from low (underdeveloped countries) to high (developed countries). Asthma is predominantly a chronic disease that can be controlled with appropriate pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions; however, exacerbations do not always respond to standard or additional treatment options, leading to urgent visits to health providers, admissions to hospital and, in severe and rare cases, death. In the USA, patients with exacerbations had significantly higher asthma-related healthcare costs: $1740 over 1 year compared with $847 for asthmatics without exacerbations. While patients with acute asthma often seek care in the emergency department (ED), most are successfully treated and subsequently discharged; only 6–12% of adult patients presenting to the ED with an exacerbation of asthma will be admitted.

The understanding and management of acute asthma have advanced considerably in recent years. Current evidence-based guidelines (National Asthma Education and Prevention Plan (NAEPP), Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA), and Canadian Thoracic Society (CTS)) suggest that early treatment with short-acting β 2 -agonists, inhaled short-acting anticholinergic agents and systemic corticosteroids (SCS) will reduce hospitalisations. On ED discharge, SCS are recommended, and further studies suggest that prescribing inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) at discharge can reduce relapse following discharge at least in adult patients. ICS in combination with long-acting β-agonists (ICS/LABA) are more effective than ICS monotherapy in patients with persistent asthma, with the number needed to treat of 19 to prevent one exacerbation. On the other hand, the impact of non-pharmacological interventions (ie, ED-based educational strategies) on relapses remains unclear.

### Treatment for acute asthma exacerbations… [^114uQ8qC]. JAMA Network (2015). Excellent credibility.

Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below. Guidelines for the management of acute asthma exacerbations recommend noninvasive ventilation as an "experimental approach for treatment of respiratory failure due to severe asthma exacerbation. "1 Clinicians in our tertiary pediatric emergency department have the option to use bilevel positive airway pressure as treatment for children with asthma exacerbations who have no signs of respiratory failure. We sought to examine whether these patients have improved clinical outcomes. Our primary predictor variable was BiPAP treatment among participants who did not have signs of respiratory failure.

1 Outcomes included hospital admission, admission to the pediatric intensive care unit, hospital length of stay, and time to spacing of albuterol inhalation to every 4 hours based on severity scoring by respiratory therapists. The output of this model was a propensity score ranging from 0 to 1 that estimated the adjusted probability of being treated with BiPAP. We then performed propensity score–matching analysis in which BiPAP-treated participants were matched 1: 3 by the propensity score with participants not treated with BiPAP, without replacement. We also fitted multiple regression models adjusted for the propensity score and other covariates to examine adjusted associations of BiPAP treatment with each outcome of interest. Results Characteristics and univariate associations for the 933 participants are displayed in Table 1.

The median AAIRS in participants treated with BiPAP indicated episodes of moderate severity; the median AAIRS in those not treated with BiPAP indicated episodes of mild to moderate severity. Discussion Our results indicate that BiPAP treatment of children and adolescents with acute asthma exacerbations who have no signs of impending respiratory failure is associated with a greater likelihood of hospital and PICU admission and no apparent benefit in decreased length of stay or time to albuterol Q4h. Propensity score analyses have been proposed as a method to estimate the causal effect of an exposure. 4, 6 Nonetheless, this study is limited because it cannot resolve whether these findings are a consequence of clinical momentum after positive pressure ventilation or of increased air trapping and ventilation-perfusion mismatch, derangements that worsen an exacerbation.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^115vEybj]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) — in the emergency department, high-dose ICS given within the first hour after presentation reduces the need for hospitalization in patients not receiving systemic corticosteroids (Evidence A); when added to systemic corticosteroids, evidence is conflicting in adults, and in children early ICS with or without systemic corticosteroids might reduce hospital admission and need for systemic corticosteroids (Evidence B). Overall, add-on ICS are well tolerated, but the agent, dose and duration remain unclear and cost may be significant; patients admitted to hospital for an asthma exacerbation should continue on, or be prescribed, ICS-containing therapy. On discharge home, patients should be prescribed ongoing ICS-containing treatment because severe exacerbation is a risk factor for future exacerbations (Evidence B) and ICS-containing medications significantly reduce asthma-related death or hospitalization (Evidence A); SABA-only treatment of asthma is no longer recommended, and adding ICS to systemic corticosteroids after discharge showed no significant short-term benefit, though post-discharge ICS were as effective as systemic corticosteroids for milder exacerbations with wide confidence limits.

### Asthma diagnosis and management [^114Rsq7P]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Asthma is a chronic inflammatory airway disease that is commonly seen in the emergency department (ED). This article provides an evidence-based review of diagnosis and management of asthma. Early recognition of asthma exacerbations and initiation of treatment are essential. Treatment is dictated by the severity of the exacerbation. Treatment involves bronchodilators and corticosteroids. Other treatment modalities including magnesium, heliox, and noninvasive ventilator support are discussed. Safe disposition from the ED can be considered after stabilization of the exacerbation, response to treatment and attaining peak flow measures.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^112gXV5Y]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Follow up after an acute exacerbation — discharge medications and review: Discharge medications should include regular maintenance ICS-containing treatment, as-needed reliever medication (low-dose ICS-formoterol, ICS-SABA or SABA) and a short course of OCS; SABA-only treatment is not recommended. Inhaler technique and adherence should be reviewed before discharge, patients should be advised to use their reliever inhaler only as-needed, and a follow-up appointment should be arranged for about 2–7 days later depending on context. At the review visit, assess whether the flare-up has resolved and whether OCS can be ceased, assess symptom control and risk factors, explore the potential cause, and review or provide a written asthma action plan. Maintenance ICS-containing treatment can generally be stepped back to pre-exacerbation levels 2–4 weeks after the exacerbation; however, if the exacerbation was preceded by symptoms suggestive of chronically poorly controlled asthma and inhaler technique and adherence are good, a step up in treatment may be indicated.

Module A: Assessment and Diagnosis of Asthma — narrative algorithm begins at "Person with symptoms and signs compatible with asthma (see Sidebar A)" and first asks "Is the patient acutely ill?". If "Yes", actions are "Treat exacerbation" and "Follow-up as appropriate". If "No", the next decision is "Is there a confidence clinical diagnosis of asthma? (Sidebar B and Appendix C)", where a "Yes" leads to "Continue to Module B: Initiation of Therapy for Initial Treatment or Continuation of therapy". If "No", assess "Is there an alternative diagnosis?", with a "Yes" leading to "Treat alternative diagnosis" and a "No" leading to "Is the patient capable of spirometry and is it readily available?". If "Yes", "Obtain spirometry", then determine "Is spirometry compatible with asthma (consistent with obstruction)?". A "Yes" leads to "Continue to Module B: Initiation of Therapy for Initial Treatment or Continuation of therapy", whereas a "No" leads to "Consider other options according to site availability and patient/provider preferences and characteristics (Refer to Sidebar C, Sidebar D, and Appendix C)". If spirometry is not feasible at that step, proceed to "Continue to Module B: Initiation of Therapy for Initial Treatment or Continuation of therapy".

### Increased versus stable doses of inhaled corticosteroids for exacerbations of chronic asthma in adults and children [^115z1egX]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

People with asthma may experience exacerbations or "attacks" during which their symptoms worsen and additional treatment is required. Written action plans may advocate doubling the dose of inhaled steroids in the early stages of an asthma exacerbation to reduce the severity of the attack and to prevent the need for oral steroids or hospital admission.

Objectives

To compare the clinical effectiveness and safety of increased versus stable doses of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) as part of a patient-initiated action plan for home management of exacerbations in children and adults with persistent asthma.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register, which is derived from searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) to March 2016. We handsearched respiratory journals and meeting abstracts.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared increased versus stable doses of ICS for home management of asthma exacerbations. We included studies of children or adults with persistent asthma who were receiving daily maintenance ICS.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected trials, assessed quality and extracted data. We contacted authors of RCTs for additional information.

Main Results

This review update added three new studies including 419 participants to the review. In total, we identified eight RCTs, most of which were at low risk of bias, involving 1669 participants with mild to moderate asthma. We included three paediatric (n = 422) and five adult (n = 1247) studies; six were parallel-group trials and two had a cross-over design. All but one study followed participants for six months to one year. Allowed maintenance doses of ICS varied in adult and paediatric studies, as did use of concomitant medications and doses of ICS initiated during exacerbations. Investigators gave participants a study inhaler containing additional ICS or placebo to be started as part of an action plan for treatment of exacerbations. The odds of treatment failure, defined as the need for oral corticosteroids, were not significantly reduced among those randomised to increased ICS compared with those taking their usual stable maintenance dose (odds ratio (OR) 0.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.68 to 1.18; participants = 1520; studies = 7). When we analysed only people who actually took their study inhaler for an exacerbation, we found much variation between study results but the evidence did not show a significant benefit of increasing ICS dose (OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.30; participants = 766; studies = 7). The odds of having an unscheduled physician visit (OR 0.96, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.41; participants = 931; studies = 3) or acute visit (Peto OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.24 to 3.98; participants = 450; studies = 3) were not significantly reduced by an increased versus stable dose of ICS, and evidence was insufficient to permit assessment of impact on the duration of exacerbation; our ability to draw conclusions from these outcomes was limited by the number of studies reporting these events and by the number of events included in the analyses. The odds of serious events (OR 1.69, 95% CI 0.77 to 3.71; participants = 394; studies = 2) and non-serious events, such as oral irritation, headaches and changes in appetite (OR 2.15, 95% CI 0.68 to 6.73; participants = 142; studies = 2), were neither increased nor decreased significantly by increased versus stable doses of ICS during an exacerbation. Too few studies are available to allow firm conclusions on the basis of subgroup analyses conducted to investigate the impact of age, time to treatment initiation, doses used, smoking history and the fold increase of ICS on the magnitude of effect; yet, effect size appears similar in children and adults.

Authors' Conclusions

Current evidence does not support increasing the dose of ICS as part of a self initiated action plan to treat exacerbations in adults and children with mild to moderate asthma. Increased ICS dose is not associated with a statistically significant reduction in the odds of requiring rescue oral corticosteroids for the exacerbation, or of having adverse events, compared with a stable ICS dose. Wide confidence intervals for several outcomes mean we cannot rule out possible benefits of this approach.

### Four patients with a history of acute exacerbations of COPD: implementing the CHEST / Canadian Thoracic Society guidelines for preventing exacerbations [^111X62Ub]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The American College of Chest Physicians and Canadian Thoracic Society have jointly produced evidence-based guidelines for the prevention of exacerbations in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This educational article gives four perspectives on how these guidelines apply to the practical management of people with COPD. A current smoker with frequent exacerbations will benefit from support to quit, and from optimisation of his inhaled treatment. For a man with very severe COPD and multiple co-morbidities living in a remote community, tele-health care may enable provision of multidisciplinary care. A woman who is admitted for the third time in a year needs a structured assessment of her care with a view to stepping up pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment as required. The overlap between asthma and COPD challenges both diagnostic and management strategies for a lady smoker with a history of asthma since childhood. Common threads in all these cases are the importance of advising on smoking cessation, offering (and encouraging people to attend) pulmonary rehabilitation, and the importance of self-management, including an action plan supported by multidisciplinary teams.

Regarding medical management for asthma, more specifically with respect to management of exacerbation, self-management, GINA 2025 guidelines recommend to consider adding a short course of oral corticosteroids (40–50 mg/day for 5–7 days for adults/adolescents; 0.5 mg/kg/day, maximum 40 mg/day, for 3–5 days for children) for severe exacerbations, such as peak expiratory flow or FEV1 < 60% personal best or predicted, or if not responding to above treatment over 2–3 days. Prefer morning dosing after first dose to minimize insomnia. Advise patients about potential adverse effects. Do not offer tapering if oral corticosteroids are taken for < 2 weeks.

### Asthma control and management in 8, 000 European patients: the REcognise asthma and LInk to symptoms and experience (REALISE) survey [^116cREBk]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background:

Asthma is one of the most common chronic diseases in the world, and previous studies have reported low levels of control. Recent developments in the availability and use of online sources of information about asthma might add to patients' knowledge and help improve control.

Aims:

To investigate whether asthma control has improved by assessing levels of symptoms, exacerbations and Global Initiative for Asthma-defined control in a real-life population of patients who use the Internet and social media, as well as evaluate patient perception of control and attitudes to asthma.

Methods:

Online surveys were conducted among 8,000 patients with asthma (aged 18–50 years, ⩾2 prescriptions in the previous 2 years, use of social media) from 11 European countries.

Results:

Levels of asthma control were low: 45% of respondents had uncontrolled asthma. Acute exacerbations were common: 44% of respondents reported having used oral steroids for asthma in the previous 12 months, 24% had visited an emergency department and 12% had been hospitalised. More than 80% of respondents (overall, and among those with a history of exacerbations) considered their asthma to be controlled. Of those who had an exacerbation requiring oral steroids, 75% regarded their asthma as not serious.

Conclusions:

Asthma control in Europe remains poor; symptoms and exacerbations are common. Many patients regard their asthma as controlled and not serious despite experiencing symptoms and exacerbations. There is a need to assess patients' control, risk and inhaler technique, and to ensure that patients are prescribed, and take, appropriate treatments.

### Factors associated with relapse in adult patients discharged from the emergency department following acute asthma: a systematic review [^11628AGv]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2017). Medium credibility.

While considerable improvement in the management of acute asthma should lead to better outcomes over time, practice variation does exist and many patients presenting to EDs do not always receive evidence-based treatment. Moreover, what works in certain settings may not be applicable to others. Despite the dissemination of effective interventions for the prevention of relapses after asthma exacerbations, these outcomes still occur, affect the quality of lifeof patients with asthma and represent significant costs to the healthcare system.

A number of studies have examined factors associated with relapse outcomes in adults after ED discharge. Notwithstanding this research, there remains a relative paucity of literature attempting to compile the existing information to influence management. The objective of this study was to summarise the evidence regarding relapses and factors associated with increased relapse in patients discharged from EDs after being treated for asthma exacerbations.

Regarding medical management for asthma, more specifically with respect to management of exacerbation, emergency department setting, other treatments, GINA 2025 guidelines recommend to consider administering IV magnesium (as a single 2 g infusion over 20 minutes in adult and pediatric patients not responding to initial treatment and having persistent hypoxemia, and in pediatric patients whose FEV1 fails to reach 60% predicted after 1 hour of care), to reduce hospital admissions, including in adult patients with FEV1 < 25–30% predicted at presentation.

### Asthma exacerbations. 5: assessment and management of severe asthma in adults in hospital [^113KwSff]. Thorax (2007). Low credibility.

It is difficult to understand why there is such a huge discrepancy between the management of severe asthma recommended by evidence-based guidelines and that observed in clinical practice. The recommendations are relatively straightforward and have been widely promoted both in guidelines and reviews. Specialist physicians need to be more proactive in their implementation of such guidelines through the use of locally derived protocols and assessment sheets, reinforced by audit. The common occurrence of severe asthma and its considerable burden to the community would support such an approach.

### Best practice advice for asthma exacerbation prevention and management in primary care: an international expert consensus [^117QKg1B]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Asthma exacerbations (also referred to as "flare-ups" or "attacks") are characterized by a sudden or progressive worsening of symptoms including wheezing, chest tightness, shortness of breath, cough, and decline in lung function. These are an alteration from the patient's usual condition, necessitating a change in therapy. Asthma exacerbations are a significant cause of disease-related morbidity, and mortality, progressive loss of lung function, and increased health care costs globally. Some data over the past decades show reductions in age-adjusted asthma mortality, while asthma incidence remains steady or slightly increased (Fig. 1). Asthma exacerbation rate data are inconsistent, with some showing increased exacerbations and some showing decreased exacerbations in recent years, but emergency department (ED) visits for asthma remain a significant challenge. Further, asthma exacerbations may be underreported as they are not always medically treated or reported.

Primary care clinicians (PCCs) play an integral role in preventing and managing asthma exacerbations and most patients can be successfully managed in primary care worldwide. Enhancing prevention and management of asthma exacerbations in primary care settings would be expected to further lower asthma morbidity and potentially mortality. The Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) report includes an algorithm for exacerbation recognition and management in primary care, which can facilitate implementation of practical step-by-step strategies to deal with exacerbations (Fig. 2).

### Optimising long-term management in acute asthma presentations to the emergency department: an interview study on patient beliefs [^116G6J28]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2025). High credibility.

Implications for practice/policy

This is the first study to explore the specific beliefs of patients in relation to medication optimisation in the ED following an acute exacerbation. Our findings include that patients often tolerate regular symptoms and poor asthma control, rely on salbutamol for symptom relief and only cite recognition of the need for adherence to ICS in light of the seriousness of their asthma after an exacerbation. This would support a rationale for moving appropriate patients towards a MART regime, using the health 'threat' of an acute exacerbation, to adopt adaptive behaviours, such as improved preventer medication adherence. This is provided sufficient support was available within the emergency care system to support patients with understanding the rationale and behaviours to implement a change. An ED attendance with an acute asthma exacerbation is therefore a potential reachable and teachable moment to move patients from inhaler regimens relying on SABA relievers to safer regimens with ICS-formoterol relievers.

The findings from this study could and are intended to inform the development of a new intervention to support patients commencing MART regimes in the ED. Understanding the beliefs and behaviours of HCP, in addition to the patients, will be essential to assess whether such an intervention is perceived to be acceptable. Applying theory from behaviour change science to the findings, as a lens through which to view cognitive, affective, social and environmental influences on behaviours will help to understand the relevant behavioural determinants for intervention development.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^116KTsTS]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Treatment in acute care settings — systemic corticosteroids — Systemic corticosteroids speed resolution of exacerbations and prevent relapse, and in acute care settings should be utilized in all but the mildest exacerbations in adults, adolescents and children 6–11 years (Evidence A). Where possible, systemic corticosteroids should be administered to the patient within 1 hour of presentation. Use of systemic corticosteroids is particularly important in the emergency department if initial SABA treatment fails to achieve lasting improvement in symptoms, the exacerbation developed while the patient was taking OCS, or the patient has a history of previous exacerbations requiring OCS. For route of delivery, oral administration is as effective as intravenous, the oral route is preferred because it is quicker, less invasive and less expensive, and OCS require at least 4 hours to produce a clinical improvement.
