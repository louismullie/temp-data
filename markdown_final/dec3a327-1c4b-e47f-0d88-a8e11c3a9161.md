## Question

Presence of thyroiditis on US

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to recognize thyroiditis on ultrasound, including the key sonographic features, how to distinguish different types of thyroiditis, how to integrate serology and clinical context, and how to manage pitfalls like malignancy mimics and nodule assessment in a background of thyroiditis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and why ultrasound is the first-line modality. Then, I should verify the core sonographic features that suggest thyroiditis. Next, I will differentiate patterns by etiology, including Hashimoto's, subacute, and Graves' disease. After that, I need to check how to correlate with serology and when to add scintigraphy or elastography. Finally, I will consider special populations, malignancy risk and mimics, and synthesize a practical diagnostic approach with reporting recommendations.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and the role of ultrasound. Thyroiditis encompasses autoimmune, infectious, and granulomatous inflammatory processes; ultrasound is the primary imaging modality because it characterizes gland architecture, vascularity, and nodules while guiding management decisions, and it is recommended in guidelines for suspected nodular or diffuse thyroid disease and for autoimmune thyroiditis workups [^7336adaf] [^bf71dca7] [^b8498c69].

> I will now examine the core sonographic features that suggest thyroiditis. Diffuse hypoechogenicity with heterogeneous echotexture is a hallmark of autoimmune thyroiditis, reflecting lymphocytic infiltration and follicular disruption; pseudonodules (focal hypoechoic areas without a true capsule) are common; vascularity varies with disease phase and activity; and the gland may be enlarged early and atrophic later, with fibrosis and calcifications in chronic disease [^5229faef] [^3ae5efb5] [^a5c30831].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — these features are not specific and can overlap with other diffuse diseases, so I need to check the pattern in context. Hashimoto's thyroiditis typically shows markedly hypoechoic, heterogeneous parenchyma with pseudonodules and increased vascularity in active phases, whereas subacute thyroiditis presents as focal or patchy ill-defined hypoechoic areas with decreased vascularity and interval changes on follow-up; Graves' disease shows diffuse hypoechogenicity with markedly increased vascularity ("thyroid inferno") on Doppler [^5229faef] [^be78a011] [^0152d3b3] [^8a586393].

> Wait, let me verify the vascular patterns because they help distinguish etiologies. In Hashimoto's, color Doppler may show increased flow in active inflammation, while in subacute thyroiditis, flow is typically decreased in the affected regions; in Graves' disease, peak systolic velocities are markedly elevated, aiding the distinction from destructive thyroiditis when the clinical picture is unclear [^8a586393] [^be78a011].

> Next, I should review how to correlate with serology and when to add nuclear medicine. TPO antibodies are present in about 90–95% of Hashimoto's, but 10–15% can be seronegative, so a normal antibody panel does not exclude autoimmune thyroiditis; in subacute thyroiditis, suppressed TSH with low uptake on scintigraphy supports the diagnosis when clinical features are equivocal; elastography can help in nodule assessment but is less reliable in diffuse thyroiditis and should be interpreted cautiously [^e916c65d] [^a5c30831] [^58cec304] [^f28f5f5e].

> I need to ensure I address special populations. In children, autoimmune thyroiditis is common and sonographic heterogeneity is more frequent with positive TPO antibodies; nodules are less common but carry a higher malignancy risk than adults, so a lower threshold for biopsy is reasonable when suspicious features are present; in pregnancy, ultrasound remains the modality of choice and management thresholds differ, with heightened vigilance for compressive symptoms and malignancy [^9d693a32] [^a15f636c] [^18948c8a].

> But wait, what if the hypoechoic area is actually malignancy masquerading as thyroiditis. Subacute thyroiditis can mimic papillary thyroid carcinoma, and conversely, malignancies such as anaplastic carcinoma or lymphoma can present with painful goiter and inflammatory markers; features like centripetal reduction of echogenicity, absence of internal vascularity, and poorly defined margins favor subacute thyroiditis, but if doubt remains, fine-needle aspiration should be pursued to exclude cancer, especially when symptoms persist or atypical features are present [^85f237e8] [^2b50aa7f] [^ff3252f6].

> Let me consider nodule assessment in a background of thyroiditis, because this is a frequent pitfall. Hashimoto's thyroiditis increases background heterogeneity and can obscure nodule margins, reducing measurement reproducibility and complicating TIRADS scoring; despite earlier reports of higher cancer risk in Hashimoto's, prospective data suggest similar malignancy rates to non-Hashimoto's nodules, though vigilance is warranted given the imaging challenges and the need for careful correlation with cytology [^39e9fde5] [^8215787f] [^abf3468c].

> I should double-check the reporting approach to ensure clarity. Standardized descriptors should include gland size, echogenicity, echotexture, vascularity, presence of pseudonodules, nodule details (composition, echogenicity, margins, calcifications, vascular pattern), and cervical lymph nodes; risk stratification systems like EU-TIRADS or ACR TI-RADS should be applied to nodules, while diffuse inflammatory changes should be described separately and correlated with serology and symptoms to guide follow-up or biopsy decisions [^dc381688] [^bf71dca7] [^3956603e].

> Let me synthesize a practical diagnostic approach. First, integrate clinical context: symptoms, goiter, pain, thyrotoxicosis, pregnancy, age, and family history. Second, perform high-resolution ultrasound with Doppler to characterize diffuse changes and identify nodules. Third, obtain TSH, free T4, and TPO antibodies; if Hashimoto's is suspected but TPO is negative, consider TgAb. Fourth, if subacute thyroiditis is suspected and the diagnosis is uncertain, consider scintigraphy to document low uptake. Fifth, for nodules, apply TIRADS and biopsy thresholds, remembering that thyroiditis can blur margins and that discordant cases may need repeat FNA or core biopsy if suspicion remains [^7336adaf] [^58cec304] [^fb293579] [^3529e23a].

> In summary, I need to ensure the key takeaways are explicit. Thyroiditis on ultrasound is suggested by diffuse hypoechogenicity with heterogeneous echotexture, pseudonodules, and variable vascularity, with patterns that differ by etiology; Hashimoto's shows hypoechogenic heterogeneity with pseudonodules, subacute shows focal ill-defined hypoechoic areas with decreased flow, and Graves' shows diffuse hypoechogenicity with marked hypervascularity; correlation with serology and, when needed, scintigraphy improves diagnostic confidence, and careful attention to nodule assessment in thyroiditis prevents both under- and over-calling malignancy [^5229faef] [^be78a011] [^8a586393] [^e916c65d].

---

Thyroiditis on ultrasound shows **diffuse hypoechogenicity** with heterogeneous echotexture and ill-defined margins [^5229faef]; in Hashimoto's, pseudonodules and a "hypoechoic triangle" sign may be seen [^85415b4b], while subacute thyroiditis presents as focal, ill-defined hypoechoic areas with reduced vascularity [^be78a011] [^85f237e8]. These features are **nonspecific** and overlap with malignancy, so correlation with clinical context, serology, and, when needed, FNA is essential [^c878209f] [^3654f39b]. Ultrasound is the **first-line modality** for detecting and characterizing thyroiditis, guiding management and follow-up [^bf71dca7] [^b8498c69].

---

## Sonographic features of thyroiditis

Several **characteristic sonographic findings** are associated with thyroiditis:

- **Diffuse hypoechogenicity**: A hallmark of thyroiditis, reflecting lymphocytic infiltration and follicular destruction [^5229faef] [^e916c65d].

- **Heterogeneous echotexture**: Irregular, patchy echogenicity due to inflammatory changes and fibrosis [^5229faef] [^a5c30831].

- **Ill-defined margins**: Poorly demarcated gland boundaries, especially in subacute thyroiditis [^be78a011] [^85f237e8].

- **Pseudonodules**: Focal hypoechoic areas mimicking nodules, common in Hashimoto's thyroiditis [^a5c30831] [^bdff024a].

- **Increased vascularity**: Hypervascularity on color Doppler, particularly in Graves' disease ("thyroid inferno" sign) [^8a586393] [^9f3a12bd].

- **Hypoechoic triangle sign**: A specific sign of advanced autoimmune thyroiditis, indicating overt thyroid failure [^85415b4b].

---

## Different types of thyroiditis and their ultrasound appearances

| **Type of thyroiditis** | **Ultrasound appearance** |
|-|-|
| Hashimoto's thyroiditis (chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis) | - Diffuse hypoechogenicity <br/> - Heterogeneous echotexture <br/> - Pseudonodules <br/> - Hypoechoic triangle sign in advanced cases [^5229faef] [^85415b4b] [^a5c30831] |
| Subacute thyroiditis (de Quervain's thyroiditis) | - Focal, ill-defined hypoechoic areas <br/> - Reduced vascularity <br/> - Enlarged lymph nodes [^be78a011] [^85f237e8] |
| Graves' disease (diffuse toxic goiter) | - Diffuse hypoechogenicity <br/> - Marked hypervascularity ("thyroid inferno" sign) [^8a586393] [^9f3a12bd] |
| Acute infectious thyroiditis | - Focal hypoechoic areas <br/> - Abscess formation <br/> - Surrounding soft tissue edema [^notfound] |

## Differentiating thyroiditis from other thyroid conditions

Ultrasound helps distinguish thyroiditis from other thyroid diseases, but **overlap exists**:

- **Hashimoto's vs. Graves' disease**: Both show diffuse hypoechogenicity, but Graves' has marked hypervascularity, whereas Hashimoto's typically shows normal or mildly increased flow [^8a586393] [^9f3a12bd].

- **Thyroiditis vs. malignancy**: Thyroiditis can mimic malignancy (e.g. irregular margins, hypoechogenicity), but pseudonodules and clinical context help differentiate; FNA is indicated when suspicion persists [^c878209f] [^3654f39b].

- **Thyroiditis vs. nodular disease**: Thyroiditis often coexists with nodules; careful evaluation of nodule features and background parenchyma is essential [^5229faef] [^b8498c69].

---

## Clinical implications and management

Ultrasound findings in thyroiditis guide clinical management by:

- **Confirming diagnosis**: Supporting clinical and laboratory findings, especially when serology is inconclusive [^e916c65d] [^a5c30831].

- **Guiding therapy**: Informing decisions on medical therapy, surveillance, or intervention [^bf71dca7] [^b8498c69].

- **Monitoring disease progression**: Tracking changes in gland size, echogenicity, and vascularity over time [^5229faef] [^bdff024a].

- **Identifying complications**: Detecting nodules, lymphadenopathy, or progression to hypothyroidism [^5229faef] [^e916c65d].

---

## Limitations and challenges

Despite its utility, ultrasound has **limitations**:

- **Operator dependence**: Accuracy varies with operator expertise and equipment quality [^359fda0b].

- **Overlap with malignancy**: Some features mimic cancer, necessitating cautious interpretation and, at times, biopsy [^c878209f] [^3654f39b].

- **Nonspecific findings**: Many features are not pathognomonic, requiring clinical correlation [^c878209f] [^5229faef].

---

Thyroiditis on ultrasound presents with diffuse hypoechogenicity, heterogeneous echotexture, and ill-defined margins, with features varying by subtype. Ultrasound is the **first-line modality** for detection and characterization, but findings are nonspecific; therefore, correlation with clinical and laboratory data is essential for accurate diagnosis and management [^bf71dca7] [^b8498c69].

A variety of inflammatory disorders, generically classified as "thyroiditis," can affect the thyroid gland diffusely, generating distinctive radiographic patterns. While a precise diagnosis can seldom be made based on sonographic appearance alone, interpreting these patterns in the correct clinical and biochemical context will help support the most appropriate diagnosis. We believe that the generic term "thyroiditis" is often not helpful and often may be incorrect. Therefore, it is important for radiologists to understand the sonographic and functional correlations to provide the most appropriate differential diagnosis in their reports. This brief review is designed to provide information and guidance for radiologists when dealing with various thyroid disorders which cause diffuse changes in the thyroid and underline the pitfalls most often encountered in clinical practice.

Clinical evidence supports the association of ultrasound features with benign or malignant thyroid nodules and serves as the basis for sonographic stratification of thyroid nodules, according to an estimated thyroid cancer risk. Contemporary guidelines recommend management strategies according to thyroid cancer risk, thyroid nodule size, and the clinical scenario. Yet, reproducible and accurate thyroid nodule risk stratification requires expertise, time, and understanding of the weight different ultrasound features have on thyroid cancer risk. The application of artificial intelligence to overcome these limitations is promising and has the potential to improve the care of patients with thyroid nodules.

AACE/ACE/AME thyroid nodules—ultrasound (US) indications and objectives: High-resolution US is the most sensitive test available for detecting thyroid nodules, measuring their dimensions, identifying their content, and evaluating any associated changes in the thyroid gland. If results of palpation are normal, US should be performed when a thyroid nodule is suspected on clinical grounds or risk factors have been recognized. In all patients with palpable thyroid nodules or multinodular goiters (MNGs), US should be performed to achieve the following: aid in the diagnosis of diffuse causes (e.g., chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis), look for coincidental thyroid nodules or diffuse thyroid gland changes, detect US features suggestive of malignancy and select the lesions for biopsy, assess the presence of extracapsular growth or suspicious lymph nodes, and obtain an objective measure of the baseline volume of the thyroid gland and of lesions assigned to follow-up or nonsurgical therapy.

### ESR essentials: thyroid imaging-practice recommendations by the European society of head and neck radiology [^bf71dca7]. European Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Thyroid nodules are frequently encountered at imaging, yet most are benign and do not require intervention. The clinical challenge lies in distinguishing nodules that warrant further investigation from those that do not, to avoid unnecessary biopsies, anxiety, and overtreatment. Ultrasound (US) is the primary imaging modality for thyroid nodule evaluation, supported by structured risk stratification systems such as ACR TI-RADS and EU-TIRADS, which incorporate specific sonographic features and size thresholds to guide clinical decision-making. Nodules without high-risk features can be safely monitored or ignored, especially in asymptomatic patients. Conversely, suspicious characteristics (e.g. irregular margins, microcalcifications, or marked hypoechogenicity) should prompt further assessment, including fine-needle aspiration (FNA). Diffuse thyroid disorders, including Hashimoto's thyroiditis and Graves' disease, are best assessed using US and thyroid function tests. In thyroid cancer, a multidisciplinary team approach involving radiologists, endocrinologists, pathologists, and nuclear medicine specialists is essential for optimal patient care. To implement these recommendations, radiologists should adopt standardised US reporting systems, apply evidence-based criteria for further workup, and collaborate closely with referring clinicians. This approach ensures accurate diagnosis, reduces unnecessary procedures, and aligns radiological practice with current guidelines to support high-value, patient-centred care. KEY POINTS: Ultrasound (US) is the gold standard imaging modality for evaluating thyroid pathology. Implementation of the EU-TIRADS and ACR-TIRADS constitutes a critical part of the work-up of thyroid nodules and is essential for their effective management. Interdisciplinary discussion with all specialists concerned is the most effective way of ensuring that the best possible management strategy is implemented in thyroid cancers.

### Convolutional neural network-based computer-assisted diagnosis of Hashimoto's thyroiditis on ultrasound [^a5c30831]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Hashimoto’s thyroiditis (HT) is a typical, organ-specific, autoimmune disease, and it is the most common chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis. HT is characterized by autoimmune-mediated destruction of the thyroid gland, involving the apoptosis of thyroid epithelial cells, with diffuse lymphocytic infiltration of the thyroid by predominantly thyroid-specific B and T cells and follicular destruction. Consequently, these typically result in the painless enlargement of the thyroid gland, fibroblastic proliferation, calcification, and vascular proliferation, and it is the main reason for primary hypothyroidism in the United States. With the increasing attention of the general population to thyroid diseases, the prevalence of HT has been increasing in the past few decades. The incidence of HT is >0.3 to 1.5 per 1000 cases every year, whereas at autopsy, 40% to 45% of women and 20% of men are diagnosed with HT in the United Kingdom and the United States. In China, there are more than 40 million people with primary hypothyroidism, of whom 80% are caused by HT. Hence, early diagnosis of HT would be important in monitoring the disease course more efficiently, thus tailoring treatment protocols and delaying thyroid failure.

Conventionally, HT diagnosis is confirmed by demonstrating the presence of autoantibodies to thyroglobulin antibodies (TgAb) and thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPOAb). However, the serological presentation can vary significantly and a critical proportion of patients can have low or even 0 autoantibody levels (10%-15%). Moreover, the invasive nature of fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy diminishes its applicability and appropriateness in the clinical diagnosis of benign disorders. Thus, ultrasound (US; or ultrasonography), which is an essential noninvasive imaging modality, can help physicians make efficient clinical diagnosis processes. However, compared with other thyroid disorders, US characteristics of HT are more difficult to distinguish because different HT pathologies can exhibit different US features. This association may be due to hypo-echogenicity, wherein inflammatory cells infiltrate into the thyroid. Moreover, pseudo-nodules and inhomogeneous parenchyma have also been observed in HT. The US features of nodular HT can significantly vary and can sometimes be associated with other benign and malignant thyroid nodules. These findings imply that it is difficult to identify the subtle sonographic differences between normal and HT images, as powerful features are needed to distinguish such differences. Hence, it is crucial to improve the accuracy of US diagnosis and thus render this imaging modality as the primary screening method of HT.

### Sonographic appearance of focal thyroiditis [^7e838039]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study is to report the sonographic appearance of focal thyroid nodules that prove to be lymphocytic thyroiditis on fine-needle aspiration.

Conclusion

In a patient population undergoing sonography for palpable nodular disease without known thyroiditis, focal nodules of thyroiditis had a wide variety of appearances. They most commonly appeared as solid hyperechoic nodules with ill-defined margins. However, the echogenicity was variable, and calcification and cystic-appearing regions were also noted. The vascularity of these nodules as assessed with color Doppler and power Doppler sonography also varied widely. Biopsy of these lesions is still necessary because there are no sonographic features that can reliably diagnose these lesions as thyroiditis and differentiate them from other lesions.

### Pediatric thyroid ultrasound: a radiologist's checklist [^9d693d32]. Pediatric Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Ultrasonography (US) is the imaging method of choice for evaluating the pediatric thyroid gland, complemented by scintigraphy and thyroid function tests, especially when evaluating children with suspected congenital hypothyroidism, goiter, infectious or autoimmune diseases, or neoplasm. Diagnostic considerations in newborns with congenital hypothyroidism mainly include dysgenesis, dyshormonogenesis, transient hypothyroidism and central (hypophyseal) hypothyroidism. The midline of the neck should be scrutinized for thyroid tissue from the floor of the mouth to the thoracic inlet. Cystic and echogenic ultimobranchial remnants should not be misinterpreted as orthotopic thyroid tissue. Diffuse thyroid diseases affect older children; these comprise Hashimoto and Graves diseases and infectious thyroiditis and exhibit features similar to those in adults. It is important to note that the diffuse sclerosing variant of papillary thyroid cancer can complicate thyroiditis and should not be confused with Hashimoto disease. In children with solid nodules the threshold for fine-needle aspiration biopsy or surgery should be lower compared to adults because of a higher likelihood of malignancy compared with adults. Biopsy should be considered in nodules with suspicious ultrasonographic features, even when smaller than 1 cm. Adult classification systems of thyroid nodules, although useful, are not sufficient to safely discriminate the nodules' likelihood of malignancy in children. We describe key sonographic findings and suggest a standard checklist that might be considered while performing and interpreting thyroid US in neonates and children.

### Sonographic characteristics and interval changes of subacute thyroiditis [^0152d3b3]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

This study aimed to assess the sonographic characteristics and interval changes of subacute thyroiditis using follow-up sonography.

Methods

From January 2008 to December 2014, 85 patients with clinically suspected subacute thyroiditis underwent sonographic examinations by a single radiologist. Subacute thyroiditis was confirmed on the basis of the clinical, sonographic, and cytohistopathologic findings. On the initial and follow-up sonograms, the individual sonographic findings and interval changes were retrospectively investigated by the same radiologist. According to the sonographic configuration, subacute thyroiditis lesions were categorized as nodular or non-nodular. The interval changes in the lesions were classified as follows: "disappeared," "decreased," "increased," "eventually smaller," "eventually larger," or "no interval change."

Results

Subacute thyroiditis was confirmed in 64 of the 85 patients. In these 64 patients, nodular (n = 39) and non-nodular (n = 35) lesions were found; 10 patients had both nodular and non-nodular lesions. Of the 64 patients, 41 underwent sonographic follow-up. In both nodular and non-nodular lesions, the common interval changes included disappeared, decreased, and eventually smaller patterns. Although the increased pattern was found only in 4 nodular lesions, there was no significant difference in the interval changes between nodular and non-nodular lesions. On follow-up sonography, a new lesion was detected in 6 patients.

Conclusions

The prevalence rate of nodular subacute thyroiditis lesions on sonography was high, and the interval changes in the lesions were variable.

### Ultrasonography of thyroid nodules: a pictorial review [^15b22d07]. Insights Into Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

Reporting findings

In providing a report after the US examination of the thyroid nodule, the practitioner should aim to address several factors regarding the nodule. The report should include a detailed description of the nodule with regard to its size, location, composition and echogenicity in relation to surrounding structures. The nodular margins should be closely examined to indicate the contour and presence of rim calcification or halo, and any additional features such as colloid calcification and vascular pattern. The lymph nodes should also be screened and commented on if there are any suspicious features. Based on the collection of sonographic findings, the practitioner should provide a US classification of the thyroid nodule from U1 to U5. When there are multiple nodules, the most suspicious nodule should be used for scoring. If FNAC was performed, this should also be clearly documented on the report. The clinical team should be informed of the results, irrespective of benign or malignant disease. A multi-disciplinary approach is recommended if malignancy is suspected or when there is discordance between US or FNAC findings and clinical evidence.

The BTA thyroid nodule U-classification is designed to simplify the process of identifying suspicious and malignant nodules. Its purpose is to provide guidance on the appropriate use of FNAC. Benign thyroid conditions, such as thyroiditis, are not part of the U-classification, and are not included in the pictorial review. Apart from the BTA U-classification, there are other recognised guidelines for the management of thyroid nodules. A comparison of the U-classification with other guidelines is beyond the scope of this pictorial review, which serves to illustrate the sonographic features as described in the BTA guideline. These are limitations of this study.

### Computer-aided diagnostic system for detection of hashimoto thyroiditis on ultrasound images from a Polish population [^8e3d98bd]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Objectives

Computer-aided diagnostic (CAD) techniques aid physicians in better diagnosis of diseases by extracting objective and accurate diagnostic information from medical data. Hashimoto thyroiditis is the most common type of inflammation of the thyroid gland. The inflammation changes the structure of the thyroid tissue, and these changes are reflected as echogenic changes on ultrasound images. In this work, we propose a novel CAD system (a class of systems called ThyroScan) that extracts textural features from a thyroid sonogram and uses them to aid in the detection of Hashimoto thyroiditis.

Methods

In this paradigm, we extracted grayscale features based on stationary wavelet transform from 232 normal and 294 Hashimoto thyroiditis-affected thyroid ultrasound images obtained from a Polish population. Significant features were selected using a Student t test. The resulting feature vectors were used to build and evaluate the following 4 classifiers using a 10-fold stratified cross-validation technique: support vector machine, decision tree, fuzzy classifier, and K-nearest neighbor.

Results

Using 7 significant features that characterized the textural changes in the images, the fuzzy classifier had the highest classification accuracy of 84.6%, sensitivity of 82.8%, specificity of 87.0%, and a positive predictive value of 88.9%.

Conclusions

The proposed ThyroScan CAD system uses novel features to noninvasively detect the presence of Hashimoto thyroiditis on ultrasound images. Compared to manual interpretations of ultrasound images, the CAD system offers a more objective interpretation of the nature of the thyroid. The preliminary results presented in this work indicate the possibility of using such a CAD system in a clinical setting after evaluating it with larger databases in multicenter clinical trials.

### Role of ultrasonography in thyroid disease [^d0dbfd02]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

Ultrasonography (US) is the single-most valuable imaging modality in the evaluation of the thyroid gland. This review discusses the US appearances of thyroid nodules, emphasizing sonographic features associated with potentially malignant or, at the other end of the spectrum, likely benign nodules. Diffuse thyroid abnormalities have also been reviewed. The technique of ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy and the emerging role of elastography in characterizing thyroid nodules have also been addressed.

### The diagnosis and management of thyroid nodules: a review [^3654f39b]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Thyroid nodules are common, being detected in up to 65% of the general population. This is likely due to the increased use of diagnostic imaging for purposes unrelated to the thyroid. Most thyroid nodules are benign, clinically insignificant, and safely managed with a surveillance program. The main goal of initial and long-term follow-up is identification of the small subgroup of nodules that harbor a clinically significant cancer (≈10%), cause compressive symptoms (≈5%), or progress to functional disease (≈5%).

Observations

Thyroid function testing and ultrasonographic characteristics guide the initial management of thyroid nodules. Certain ultrasound features, such as a cystic or spongiform appearance, suggest a benign process that does not require additional testing. Suspicious sonographic patterns including solid composition, hypoechogenicity, irregular margins, and microcalcifications should prompt cytological evaluation. Additional diagnostic procedures, such as molecular testing, are indicated only in selected cases, such as indeterminate cytology (≈20%-30% of all biopsies). The initial risk estimate, derived from ultrasound and, if performed, cytology report, should determine the need for treatment and the type, frequency, and length of subsequent follow-up. Management includes simple observation, local treatments, and surgery and should be based on the estimated risk of malignancy and the presence and severity of compressive symptoms.

Conclusions and Relevance

Most thyroid nodules are benign. A diagnostic approach that uses ultrasound and, when indicated, fine-needle aspiration biopsy and molecular testing, facilitates a personalized, risk-based protocol that promotes high-quality care and minimizes cost and unnecessary testing.

### Sonographic features of thyroid nodules that may help distinguish clinically atypical subacute thyroiditis from thyroid malignancy [^85f237e8]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives

The purpose of this study was to evaluate sonographic features for distinguishing clinically atypical subacute thyroiditis from malignant thyroid nodules.

Methods

A total of 165 hypoechoic thyroid nodules without calcification in 135 patients with histologic diagnosis were included in this study. These nodules were classified into 2 groups: a thyroiditis group (55 nodules in 36 patients) and a malignancy group (110 nodules in 99 patients). The sonographic features of the groups were retrospectively reviewed.

Results

No significant differences were detected for the variables of marked echogenicity, a taller-than-wide shape, and mixed vascularity. However, a poorly defined margin was detected more frequently in the thyroiditis group than the malignancy group (P < .05); it yielded a high capability for differential diagnosis of atypical subacute thyroiditis, with sensitivity and specificity of 87.3% and 80.9%, respectively. Centripetal reduction echogenicity was observed exclusively in the thyroiditis group, with high specificity (100%) but low sensitivity (21.8%) for atypical subacute thyroiditis diagnosis. All of the thyroiditis nodules with a positive color signal showed noninternal vascularity (negative predictive value, 100%).

Conclusions

There is a considerable overlap between the sonographic features of atypical subacute thyroiditis and thyroid malignancy. However, the margin, echogenicity, and vascularity type are helpful indicators for differential diagnosis of atypical subacute thyroiditis.

### Sonographic appearance of thyroid cancer in patients with hashimoto thyroiditis [^ae5ba938]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives

To determine whether the sonographic appearance of thyroid cancer differs in patients with and without Hashimoto thyroiditis.

Methods

Patients with histologically proven thyroid cancer who had thyroid peroxidase (TPO) antibodies measured and sonography performed preoperatively were included. We evaluated each nodule for size, echogenicity, composition, margins, halo, and vascularity and evaluated the background heterogeneity of the gland.

Results

There were 162 thyroid cancers in 145 patients. Forty-two patients (29.0%) had Hashimoto thyroiditis with positive TPO antibodies, and 103 patients (71.0%) had negative TPO antibodies. The background echogenicity was more often heterogeneous in TPO antibody-positive patients compared to those who had negative TPO antibodies (57.1% versus 26.2%; P= .0005). Comparing cancers in TPO antibody-positive to TPO antibody-negative patients, there was no significant difference in the size, echogenicity, composition, margins, halo presence, calcification presence and type, or vascularity of the cancerous nodule (P > .05). Among TPO antibody-positive patients, comparing thyroid cancerous nodules in patients with heterogeneous glands to those with homogeneous glands, there was no significant difference in any sonographic characteristic except the margin of the nodule, which was more often irregular or poorly defined in heterogeneous glands and more often smooth in homogeneous glands (P< .05).

Conclusions

Sonographic features of thyroid cancer are similar in patients with and without Hashimoto thyroiditis. Among patients with Hashimoto thyroiditis and thyroid cancer, the sonographic appearance of the cancerous nodule is similar, except that cancerous nodule margins are more likely to be irregular or poorly defined when the gland is heterogeneous.

### Thyroid function, autoimmunity, thyroid volume, and metabolic profile in people with hashimoto thyroiditis [^e916c65d]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The thyroid gland is the most affected organ by autoimmune diseases. Hashimoto’s thyroiditis (HT) represents the foremost prevalent endocrine disorder and the principal cause of hypothyroidism. The diagnosis of HT requires an evaluation including clinical features, serological detection of antibodies against thyroid antigens, such as thyroperoxidase and thyroglobulin, and characteristic findings on thyroid ultrasound. Anti-thyroperoxidase antibodies (TPOab) emerge as the best serologic hallmark for establishing an HT diagnosis due to their specificity and sensitivity. TPOab are detectable in nearly 95% of HT patients while rare in healthy controls, in contrast to anti-thyroglobulin antibodies (Tgab), antibodies against the most abundant protein on the thyroid gland, which are positive in approximately 60 − 70% of patients (less sensitive) and are also present in a higher number and proportion of healthy controls (less specific).

Hypothyroidism from Hashimoto’s disease becomes more common with advancing age, with a predilection for women and individuals with concomitant autoimmune conditions. Clinical hypothyroidism is defined as thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) concentrations surpassing the reference range alongside decreased free thyroxine (FT4) concentrations, while subclinical hypothyroidism delineates TSH concentrations above the reference range despite normal FT4 concentrations.

Thyroid glands affected by autoimmune diseases can show a hypoechogenic pattern. These structural changes usually precede autoantibodies detection and other laboratory alterations. Although about 50% of HT patients demonstrate normal thyroid volume, there is a notable dispersion in volume values when compared to healthy controls. Patients with smaller thyroid volume have more pronounced hypothyroidism, while those with subclinical hypothyroidism predominantly have goiter. In the initial phase, there is lymphocytic infiltration, culminating in thyroid volume augmentation. After that, subsequent atrophy precipitates progressive volume reduction.

In addition, most laboratories quote adult ranges, which are not necessarily applicable to young children, and regression toward the mean is common, justifying that the test be repeated before embarking on treatment. On the other hand, neck ultrasounds are frequently performed for diffuse goiter or non-thyroid conditions. Yet, an ultrasound is not required to make a diagnosis of Hashimoto thyroiditis and small cysts and nodules discovered incidentally often lead to unjustified concerns about neoplasia.

### Sonography of the thyroid [^69551b23]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Nodular thyroid disease is very common, and the vast majority of nodules are benign. Sonography serves as an effective diagnostic tool in identifying nodular features that are concerning for malignancy and those with a benign appearance. The American College of Radiology has developed a risk-stratification system called the Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System, which uses the sonographic appearance of nodules combined with nodule size to determine the need for fine-needle aspiration or sonographic surveillance to diagnose malignancy. Familiarity with the sonographic appearance of diffuse thyroid disease allows differentiation of these conditions from nodular thyroid disease.

### Evolution of sonographic appearance of the thyroid gland in children with Hashimoto's thyroiditis [^69e57a67]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Although thyroid ultrasound is a valuable tool for the diagnosis and follow-up of patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT), classical sonographic findings are not always present.

Aim

To calculate the time needed for children with HT and normal ultrasound at diagnosis to develop characteristic sonographic findings.

Patients and Methods

105 children (23 male and 82 female) with HT (mean age 9.4 +/- 2.9 years) were studied. Physical examination and measurements of TSH and fT4 levels were performed at diagnosis, at 3-month intervals for the first year, and twice yearly thereafter. Thyroid ultrasound was performed at diagnosis and twice yearly thereafter. The median follow-up duration was 18 months (range: 6-61 months).

Results

The time needed for 30%, 50%, and 70% of children to demonstrate an abnormal thyroid sonographic pattern was 4, 7, and 14 months, respectively. Important factors accelerating sonographic changes were goiter (p = 0.023), hypothyroidism (p = 0.0255), and seropositivity for both thyroid peroxidase (anti-TPO) and thyroglobulin (anti-Tg) autoantibodies (p = 0.0005).

Conclusion

Sonographic findings of HT are present in 37% of children at diagnosis. Fifty percent of children with normal initial thyroid US will develop changes within 7 months; however, characteristic findings may not develop for over 4 years.

### Thyroid ultrasound: diffuse and nodular disease [^5229faef]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

Thyroid ultrasound with gray-scale and color Doppler is the most helpful imaging modality to differentiate normal thyroid parenchyma from diffuse or nodular thyroid disease by evaluating glandular size, echogenicity, echotexture, margins, and vascularity. The various causes of diffuse thyroid disease often have overlapping sonographic imaging features. Thyroid nodules may be hyperplastic or neoplastic, with most due to benign hyperplastic changes in architecture and benign follicular adenomas; only a small percentage are malignant. A systematic approach to nodule morphology that includes evaluation of composition, echogenicity, margin, shape, and any echogenic foci can guide decision to biopsy or follow nodules.

### The role of nuclear medicine in the clinical management of benign thyroid disorders, part 2: nodular goiter, hypothyroidism, and subacute thyroiditis [^58cec304]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Part 2 of this series of Continuing Education articles on benign thyroid disorders deals with nodular goiter, hypothyroidism, and subacute thyroiditis. Together with Part 1 (which dealt with various forms of hyperthyroidism), this article is intended to provide relevant information for specialists in nuclear medicine dealing with the clinical management of patients with benign thyroid disorders, the primary audience for this series. Goiter, an enlargement of the thyroid gland, is a common endocrine abnormality. Constitutional factors, genetic abnormalities, or dietary and environmental factors may contribute to the development of nodular goiter. Most patients with nontoxic nodular goiter are asymptomatic or have only mild mechanical symptoms (globus pharyngis). Work-up of these patients includes measurement of thyroid-stimulating hormone, free triiodothyronine, free thyroxine, thyroid autoantibodies, ultrasound imaging, thyroid scintigraphy, and fine-needle aspiration biopsy of nodules with certain ultrasound and scintigraphic features. Treatment for multinodular goiter includes dietary iodine supplementation, surgery, radioiodine therapy (to decrease thyroid size), and minimally invasive ablation techniques. Hypothyroidism ranges from rare cases of myxedema to more common mild forms (subclinical hypothyroidism). Primary hypothyroidism often has an autoimmune etiology. Clinical presentations differ in neonates, children, adults, and elderly patients. Work-up includes thyroid function tests and ultrasound imaging. Nuclear medicine is primarily used to locate ectopic thyroid tissue in congenital hypothyroidism or to detect defects in iodine organification with the perchlorate discharge test. Treatment consists of thyroid replacement therapy with l-thyroxine, adjusting the daily dose to the individual patient's metabolic and hormonal requirements. Subacute thyroiditis is a self-limited inflammatory disorder of the thyroid gland, often associated with painless or painful swelling of the gland and somatic signs or symptoms. Inflammation disrupts thyroid follicles resulting in a rapid release of stored thyroxine and triiodothyronine causing an initial thyrotoxic phase, often followed by transient or permanent hypothyroidism. Although subacute thyroiditis is often related to a viral infection, no infective agent has been identified. Subacute thyroiditis may be caused by a viral infection in genetically predisposed individuals. Work-up includes lab tests, ultrasound imaging, and radionuclide imaging. Thyroid scintigraphy demonstrates different findings depending on the phase of the illness, ranging from very low or absent tracer uptake in the thyroid gland in the hyperthyroid phase to a normal appearance in the late recovery phase. Since subacute thyroiditis is self-limited, treatment is directed toward relief of pain. High-dose nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs are usually the first-line treatment. If severe pain persists, a course of corticosteroids may be necessary. Permanent hypothyroidism develops in up to 15% of patients with subacute thyroiditis, even more than 1 y after presentation.

### Thyroid ultrasonography [^9f920b92]. World Journal of Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Background

The recent prevalence of ultrasonography (US) has facilitated the early detection and qualitative evaluation of thyroid nodules. Furthermore, novel technical developments are extending the application range of US for other thyroid diseases.

Methods

The use of US to differentiate between thyroid carcinoma and benign nodule, between a metastatic lymph node and a reactive node, between thyroid lymphoma and chronic thyroiditis, and between destruction-induced thyrotoxicosis and Graves' disease is introduced.

Results

Classification systems for thyroid nodule have shown high diagnostic accuracy for thyroid carcinomas except follicular carcinoma. US diagnosis of lymph node metastasis showed high specificity but low sensitivity. Patients who were suspected of thyroid lymphoma based on US findings should undergo incisional biopsy or thyroidectomy for diagnosis of the histologic type if fine-needle aspiration biopsy findings suggest lymphoma. Patients should be carefully followed even if they were diagnosed as negative based on cytologic findings. Measurement of thyroid blood flow is helpful for diagnosing destruction-induced thyrotoxicosis, such as painless thyroiditis, by distinguishing the lesion from Graves' disease.

Conclusions

Ultrasonography is useful for diagnosing various thyroid diseases, including thyroid carcinoma. The remaining issue to be resolved is the diagnosis of follicular carcinoma. Trials using novel techniques to differentiate these lesions are expected.

### Thyroiditis-AAFP (...) [^972befc3]. AAFP (2006). Low credibility.

Thyroiditis HASHIMOTO'S DISEASE Hashimoto's disease is an autoimmune condition characterized by the infiltration of the thyroid by lymphocytes and the formation of Askanazy cells. It is the most common inflammatory disorder of the thyroid in the United States. About seven times more women are affected than men, with the peak incidence occurring between 40 and 60 years of age. 4 and high TSH concentrations, or subclinical hypothyroidism with normal free T 4 and elevated TSH levels. High iodide intake and cigarette smoking are associated with increased risk of hypothyroidism, the latter possibly because of thiocyanates in cigarette smoke. Circulating levels of antithyroid peroxidase antibodies, usually in high titers, are a hallmark of Hashimoto's disease and are present in 90 to 95 percent of individuals with this diagnosis.

Antithyroglobulin antibodies are not as sensitive for the diagnosis, being present in only 20 to 50 percent of patients. Most patients present with a painless, small, nontender, firm goiter within two to six months after delivery. Hypothyroidism occurs in 43 percent of patients before the recovery phase, hyperthyroidism in 32 percent, and hyperthyroidism followed by hypothyroidism in 25 percent. 19, 20 Four times more women are affected than men, and the risk is increased in persons who live in areas of iodine sufficiency. 3, 18 About one half of patients with subacute lymphocytic thyroiditis present with a small goiter. 20 Between 5 and 20 percent of patients exhibit hyperthyroidism from release of pre-formed T 4 and T 3, which may be followed by hypothyroidism and then a return to normal in the majority of patients. The hyper-thyroid stage averages three to four months, and total duration of illness is less than one year.

About one half of patients have antithyroid peroxidase antibodies. 26 and may be unilateral or diffuse. Four times more women are affected than men, with the highest prevalence occurring in individuals between 30 and 60 years of age.

### Normal parathyroid glands are most often seen on neck ultrasound [^eccbc29f]. Academic Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Rationale and Objectives

The dogma is that normal parathyroid glands (PTGs) are not visible on ultrasound (US). Recently, several studies have shown that PTGs present these US features: ovoid structure, homogeneous and hyperechoic. The primary objective was to assess the detection rate, standard size and locations of normal PTGs in a population of patients consulting for thyroid US exam. The secondary objective was to determine if the presence of a goiter or a thyroiditis could modify the visualization of normal PTGs.

Method

Single-center prospective study on 192 patients based on the typical US appearance previously described to identify one or more PTGs.

Results

One or more PTGs were visualized in 75% of patients (144/192). They were visualized preferentially at the lower pole of the thyroid gland and in the infra-thyroid region (66%). The mean (± SD) size of normal PTGs was 5.68 mm (± 1,42 mm)×4.05 mm (± 1,03 mm)×2,68 mm (± 0,61 mm) and mean volume was 33.3 mm3 (± 17.75 mm3). The presence of a goiter made the search for PTGs more difficult whereas the presence of thyroiditis facilitated it.

Conclusion

The US detection rate of PTGs is high (75%). The identification of PTGs could be particularly useful in the preoperative assessment before total thyroidectomy or parathyroid surgery. It could reduce the risk of postoperative hypoparathyroidism and improve the accuracy of postoperative US surveillance of thyroid cancer. Better knowledge of the usual anatomical location of normal PTGs could also enable better detection of abnormal glands.

### ACR appropriateness criteriaThyroid disease [^be024263]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2019). Medium credibility.

There are a wide variety of diseases that affect the thyroid gland ranging from hyperplastic to neoplastic, autoimmune, or inflammatory. They can present with functional abnormality or a palpable structural change. Imaging has a key role in diagnosing and characterizing the thyroid finding for management. Imaging is also essential in the management of thyroid cancer. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Benign thyroid nodules classified as ACR TI-RADS 4 or 5: imaging and histological features [^6211233f]. European Journal of Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

American College of Radiology Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System (ACR TI-RADS) being most widely applied in clinical practice, there is an overlap in US imaging manifestations between benign and malignant thyroid nodules.

Objectives

To analyze the imaging and histological characteristics of pathological benign thyroid nodules categorized as American College of Radiology Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System (ACR TI-RADS) 4 or 5, and to explore the correlation between the suspicious sonographic signs resulting in the misdiagnoses and the histopathological features.

Materials and Methods

Overall, 227 benign thyroid nodules (215 patients) in ACR TI-RADS 4 or 5 sampled through surgical excision were analyzed between December 2020 and August 2022. We retrospectively reread the ultrasound (US) images of the pathological discordant cases, after which we performed a systematic analysis focusing on the histopathological characteristics of thyroid lesions and recorded the findings. Qualitative US features and pathological significance of the thyroid nodules were analyzed using the chi-square and Fisher's exact tests.

Results

The pathological type of 227 thyroid nodules (n = 103 in ACR TI-RADS 4 and n = 124 in ACR TI-RADS 5) was nodular goiter together with other histopathological features, namely, fibrosis (n = 103, 45.4 %), calcification (n = 70, 30.8 %), adenomatous hyperplasia (n = 31, 13.7 %), follicular epithelial hyperplasia (n = 23, 10.1 %), Hashimoto's thyroiditis (n = 18, 7.9 %), and cystic degeneration (n = 16, 7.1 %). Fibrosis was the most common histopathological feature in both ACR TI-RADS 4 (n = 42, 40.8 %) and 5 (n = 61, 49.2 %) categories of benign thyroid nodules. Thyroid nodules with fibrosis demonstrated sonographic features of "taller than wide" (p < 0.05), while lesions with follicular epithelial hyperplasia were likely to be detected with irregular and/or lobulated margins and very hypoechoic on US (p < 0.05 for both).

Conclusion

Benign thyroid nodules with histopathological findings such as fibrosis are associated with suspicious US features, which may give inappropriately higher TIRADS stratification.

### The association between thyroid carcinoma and Hashimoto's thyroiditis: the ultrasonographic and histopathologic characteristics of malignant nodules [^abf3468c]. Thyroid (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Some but not all reports, particularly those of a retrospective nature, have noted an increased risk of carcinoma in thyroid nodules in patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT). Thyroid cancer (TC) in patients with HT, however, have been reported to have a better prognosis. In the presence of HT, the ultrasonography (US) appearance of the thyroid gland might vary greatly, making it more difficult to differentiate between benign and malignant nodules. The aim of this study was to determine if there is an association between TC and HT and to determine if the US and histopathologic characteristics of malignant nodules in patients with and without HT are similar.

Methods

Six hundred thirteen patients who underwent total thyroidectomy between 2005 and 2008 for nodular goiter were included in this study. The preoperative US characteristics and postoperative histopathologic features in patients with and without HT were compared. The diagnosis of HT was based on histopathologic features.

Results

Ninety-two patients had HT. The prevalence of TC in the HT patients was 45.7%. In contrast, it was 29% in patients without HT (p = 0.001). The prevalence of HT in the patients with TC was 21.8% and in patients without TC was 11.9% (p = 0.001). The rate of incidental TC, defined as TC identified during surgery or following histopathologic examination of permanent sections despite preoperative benign cytology results, was higher in patients with HT (33.3%) than in those without (13.0%) HT (p = 0.004). The US characteristics of papillary thyroid carcinoma, which included number of nodules, echogenity, echoic texture, microcalcifications, macrocalcifications, halo sign, and regularity of margins, were similar in the group with HT compared with the group without HT. When the histopathologic characteristics of papillary thyroid carcinoma in patients with and without HT were compared, again there was no significant difference.

Conclusions

We suggest that there is an association between HT and TC, and HT may predispose to the development of TC. This indicates the need for close observation of neoplastic changes in patients with HT. Nevertheless, the presence of HT seems to have no effect on the US and histopathologic characteristics of malignant nodules in TC patients. This finding may indicate that evaluation of nodules and initial treatment of TC in these patients does not require different management.

### Subacute lymphocytic (...) [^90735b2c]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

Chronic Lymphocytic Thyroiditis Chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis is the most common inflammatory condition of the thyroid gland and the most common cause of goiter in the United States. 1, 2 It is an autoimmune condition characterized by high titers of circulating antibodies to thyroid peroxidase and thyroglobulin.
3. EPIDEMIOLOGY Chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis is the most common cause of hypothyroidism in the United States, and euthyroid persons with Hashimoto's disease develop hypothyroidism at a rate of approximately 5 percent per year. 4 Up to 95 percent of cases of chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis occur in women, usually between 30 and 50 years of age. 5 Chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis is also the most common cause of sporadic goiter in children. 5, 6 The incidence of Hashimoto's disease has risen exponentially over the past 50 years, and this increase may be related to an increased iodine content in the North American diet.
6.

In patients with an elevated TSH level and a normal thyroxine level, indications for treatment are less clear. If the TSH level is greater than 20 mU per mL with a normal T 4 level, there is a high probability that the patient will develop hypothyroidism. If the TSH level is elevated but is less than 20 mU per mL and the antimicrosomal antibody titer is greater than 1: 1, 600, hypothyroidism will develop in 80 percent of patients. Subacute Lymphocytic Thyroiditis Subacute lymphocytic thyroiditis occurs most often in the postpartum period but may also occur sporadically. EPIDEMIOLOGY Subacute lymphocytic thyroiditis comprises 29 to 50 percent of all cases of thyroiditis. 3 and occurs most often in women between 30 and 50 years of age. 6, 9 There is a higher incidence of antimicrosomal antibodies in the postpartum form of the disease than in the sporadic form.

A family history of autoimmune thyroid disease is found in 50 percent of patients with the postpartum form of thyroiditis.

Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) ultrasound variants—The follicular variant of PTC may exhibit a non-suspicious US appearance, with an oval shape, well-defined and regular margins, and an absence of microcalcifications, and the follicular variant of PTC is usually larger than the classic PTC. The tall-cell variant of PTC usually shows the traditional US signs of malignancy; these tumors frequently appear as deeply hypoechoic nodules with lobulated margins and microcalcifications, and extrathyroidal extension and lymph node metastases may also be evident at US examination. The diffuse sclerosing variant of PTC poses a diagnostic challenge at US examination because the gland may appear enlarged and diffusely hypoechoic, as in Hashimoto thyroiditis, and multiple fine and scattered hyperechoic microcalcifications may confer a “starry night” appearance to wide portions of the thyroid.

Ultrasound elastography for thyroid nodules—Clinically, a firm or hard thyroid nodule is associated with an increased risk of malignancy, and elastography evaluates tissue stiffness in palpable and nonpalpable thyroid nodules with real-time US. This technique has shown high sensitivity for thyroid carcinoma with a high (up to 97%) negative predictive value (NPV) in several series. In a multicenter prospective trial, the presence of stiffness in at least 50% of the nodule area had a sensitivity range similar to conventional ultrasound and color Doppler; the presence of at least 1 of 5 US risk factors had 85% sensitivity and 91% NPV, and when elastography was combined with US, the presence of 1 of 6 parameters had 97% sensitivity and 97% NPV, reaching an OR of 15.8. In a meta-analysis of 12 studies assessing 1,130 thyroid nodules (817 benign and 363 malignant), the threshold of elasticity scores between 2 and 3 had a sensitivity of 86.0% and a specificity of 66.7%, with positive and negative likelihood ratios and a diagnostic OR of 3.82,0.16,and 27.51, respectively, and combining elastography with B-mode US and color Doppler evaluation made the selection of nodules that do not need cytologic evaluation appear more reliable. Pitfalls include that real-time elastography is still strongly operator dependent and lacks a standardized method for data reporting, cystic lesions and nodules without calcified shells are not suitable for elastographic evaluation, and lesions in areas difficult to scan, MNGs with coexistent nodules, microcarcinomas, and nodules in chronic thyroiditis are less suitable for this.

### Thyroid primary and metastatic malignant tumours of poor prognosis may mimic subacute thyroiditis-time to change the diagnostic criteria: case reports and a review of the literature [^ff3252f6]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The diagnosis of subacute thyroiditis (SAT) is based mainly on the presence of painful thyroid goitre and a significant increase in erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). Proceeding according to these diagnostic criteria may lead to an incorrect diagnosis and treatment. Extremely dangerous is the situation when the diagnosis of SAT is erroneously made based on criteria other than ultrasound (US) image and fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB), which leads to delayed diagnosis of malignant tumour with poor prognosis.

Case presentation

Five patients with typical SAT symptoms are presented. In all of them, anaplastic thyroid cancer or metastatic thyroid tumours were finally diagnosed as the cause of the initial symptoms resembling SAT. Most of the patients were initially misdiagnosed and the proper diagnosis of malignancy was delayed.

Conclusions

The authors have proposed the new diagnostic criteria for SAT, and strongly suggest that thyroid gland US should be included in the main criteria of SAT diagnosis, together with FNAB result excluding the presence of malignant tumour.

Conventional image recognition techniques, such as analysis of grayscale histograms and computerized grayscale US, are limited by the fact that echogenicity varies according to the adjustment of the US settings and with the different stages of the disease. Recently, computer-assisted diagnosis (CAD) with novel artificial intelligence (AI) has been widely developed for automated efficient US image analysis, which uses a standardized image acquisition procedure to train and developed the CAD deep learning model. The deep convolutional neural network (CNN), which is a deep learning technique, has demonstrated the implementation of deep learning in the assessment of medical images. Utilization of multiple layers of image analysis filters in CNN allows a feature map to be generated via a systematic convolution of multiple filters across the image, which is then used as the input to the subsequent layer. Images are processed with respect to the manifestation of pixels as the input and to the desired classification as the output. However, most of the existing CADs of US have been used in the diagnosis of benign and malignant nodules of the thyroid rather than diffuse thyroid diseases. Thus, in this study, we aimed to evaluate the capability of deep learning models with CNN to provide an automated diagnosis of HT using real-world US data from clinical thyroid US examinations. Four CNN models with 9 versions were compared and ensemble. Eventually, we selected the CAD of HT (HT-CAD) as the most accurate model and evaluated its performance in the diagnosis of different HT types.

Autoimmune thyroiditis

Autoimmune thyroiditis (AIT) is a common thyroid disorder in children. The reported incidence of PTC among children and adolescents with Hashimoto thyroiditis is 0.6% to 3%. Hashimoto thyroiditis was found in 6.3% to 40% of those with PTC. In Graves disease, the presence of a thyroid nodule is associated with an increased risk of PTC, with mixed data regarding the risk for extrathyroidal extension and metastases. Possible explanations for thyroid carcinoma development in the setting of AIT include (1) persistent chronic inflammation creating a favorable environment for malignant transformation, with infiltrating immune cells promoting abnormal repair of DNA, and (2) persistent elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) or thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin causing follicular epithelial hyperplasia and promoting tumorigenesis. In pediatric patients, no clear relationship between thyroid carcinoma outcome and AIT has been described.

Thyroid nodules in the setting of AIT is an independent risk factor for thyroid carcinoma. The current guidelines recommend that ultrasound should be performed in children with AIT when there is a palpable nodule, gland asymmetry, or cervical lymphadenopathy. Ultrasound should also be considered when deciding between surgery and radioiodine ablation for pediatric patients with Graves pursuing definitive treatment.

Diagnosis

Presentation

Most children with thyroid carcinoma present with an asymptomatic neck mass: approximately 40% are discovered by the patient or their family, 40% are found by medical providers, and 20% are incidentally detected during imaging. Nonpalpable thyroid nodules identified by imaging have the same risk for DTC as palpable lesions of the same size, although screening imaging can identify smaller tumors. It is recommended for all thyroid nodules with suspicious sonographic features in children be further investigated; the likelihood of DTC in a thyroid nodule is higher in children (19-22%) than in adults (12-14%).

Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) thyroid dysfunction—For patients with destructive thyroiditis, the initial thyrotoxic phase is usually transient and is followed by hypothyroidism; therefore, close monitoring is recommended. For symptomatic patients, β-blockers may be considered, and if thyrotoxic symptoms are severe, a short course of high doses of glucocorticoids can be utilized for the control of symptoms. All patients in whom ICIs are initiated should undergo thyroid testing at baseline and before each new cycle for 4 to 6 cycles (every 4-6 weeks), with subsequent individualization of thyroid function tests to every 3 to 6 months pending clinical symptoms; thyroid ultrasound is recommended for those with palpable thyroid nodules. For clinically stable cases, transitory thyrotoxicosis can be treated with β-blockers because there is no role of antithyroid medications or steroids in destructive thyroiditis.

### Hashimoto's thyroiditis is not associated with increased risk of thyroid cancer in patients with thyroid nodules: a single-center prospective study [^8215787f]. Thyroid (2010). Low credibility.

Background

The risk of thyroid carcinoma in patients with thyroid nodules associated with Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT) is a debatable issue. The studies defining the true risk of thyroid malignancy are scanty and mainly depend on retrospective series. To eliminate inherent bias of retrospective studies, this prospective study was carried out to evaluate the true malignancy rate of unselected thyroid nodules in patients with HT who underwent fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC).

Methods

These prospective data were gathered on all patients newly diagnosed with thyroid nodules who were sent for FNAC between May 2006 and August 2009. All patients were evaluated for the presence of HT diagnosis by measuring thyroid autoantibodies. If a patient had at least one positive thyroid autoantibody, then the patient was defined as HT with thyroid nodules. There were 164 patients (147 women and 17 men) with thyroid nodules associated with HT (HT group). There were 551 patients (432 women and 119 men) with thyroid nodules without HT (control group). All patients underwent FNAC and ultrasonography (US).

Results

The malignancy rate was 1.0% in HT group (2 out of 191 nodules) and 2.7% in the control group (19 out of 713 nodules), a not significant (p = 0.19) difference. In the two cytologically malignant nodules in HT group and 19 in the control group, papillary thyroid carcinoma was diagnosed after thyroidectomy and histopathological examination. US features of nodule echogenicity, structure, margin, and Doppler flow were similar between the two groups. US features of microcalcification and absence of peripheral halo were more prominent in the nodules of the control group (p = 0.002 and p < 0.001, respectively).

Conclusions

On the basis of cytopathological criteria, thyroid nodules in patients with HT are no more likely to be malignant than in those without HT. Many of the US features of benign thyroid nodules are similar in patients with and patients without HT.

### Subacute granulomatous (de quervain) thyroiditis: grayscale and color Doppler sonographic characteristics [^be78a011]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives

To describe the sonographic characteristics of subacute granulomatous (De Quervain) thyroiditis.

Methods

We retrospectively identified all patients at our institution during the last 11 years who had thyroid sonography with findings suggestive of subacute granulomatous thyroiditis. We then reviewed clinical data and laboratory results to establish the clinical diagnosis. A final diagnosis of subacute granulomatous thyroiditis was made on the basis of clinical symptoms, suppressed thyrotropin, an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and/or reduced or absent radionuclide uptake while hyperthyroid.

Results

Our study population consisted of 35 patients. Twenty-seven patients (79.4%) met clinical criteria for subacute thyroiditis. Symptoms included neck pain in 26 of 27 patients with subacute thyroiditis. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate ranged from 22 to 101 mm/h. In 21 cases (77.8%), sonography revealed focal, poorly defined, nonovoid areas of decreased echogenicity. Findings were bilateral in 16 patients and unilateral in 5. In the remaining 6, the gland or an entire lobe was diffusely heterogeneous. Color Doppler interrogation was performed in 20 patients. Flow was decreased to the sonographically abnormal areas in 19 (95%) and slightly increased in 1 patient. In all 9 patients who underwent radionuclide scanning, focal defects or large areas of decreased or absent uptake were found during the time of suppressed thyrotropin. Enlarged lymph nodes were noted in 16 patients (59.3%).

Conclusions

The positive predictive value of sonography for diagnosing subacute granulomatous thyroiditis is 79.4%. The most common sonographic appearance is poorly defined regions of decreased echogenicity with decreased vascularity in the affected areas.

### Ultrasound-pathology discordant nodules on core-needle biopsy: malignancy risk and management strategy [^3529e23a]. Thyroid (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The reported malignancy rates of thyroid nodules that appear suspicious on ultrasound (US) but yield benign fine-needle aspiration (FNA) cytology results range from 13.6% to 56.6%. However, the malignancy risk of nodules that are discordant on US and core-needle biopsy (CNB) pathological findings has not been evaluated. This study evaluated the malignancy risk associated with thyroid nodules that are suspicious on US but yield benign CNB results.

Methods

Between July 2008 and November 2011, 1309 patients with 1313 thyroid nodules underwent US-guided CNB. Among these, 166 thyroid nodules that were suspicious on US but yielded benign CNB results were retrospectively reviewed. Benign nodules were diagnosed by surgery, FNA, and/or CNB that was repeated at least twice or CNB and lesion size stability on follow-up. The malignancy risk of US-pathology discordant nodules was calculated according to recommendations by Moon et al., and a further evaluation was conducted using four different US risk systems. Factors that differentiated benign from malignant nodules were assessed using the chi-square test or Fisher's exact test. Moreover, the histological findings of US-pathology discordant nodules were analyzed.

Results

Patients with benign and malignant nodules did not differ significantly regarding clinical and demographic characteristics. Of the 166 US-pathology discordant nodules, seven (4.2%) were confirmed malignant. The malignancy risks associated with the five US risk systems ranged from 3.6% to 5.5%. Regarding suspicious US features, only the number of suspicious features was associated with malignancy (p=0.002). Histological analysis of benign CNB specimens with suspicious US features revealed fibrosis (77.6%), thyroiditis (28.7%), calcifications (10.6%), and hemosiderin deposition (6.4%).

Conclusions

The malignancy risk among thyroid nodules with discordant US and CNB results ranged from 3.6% to 5.5%, depending on US risk systems. However, repeated biopsy may be necessary for selected thyroid nodules with more than two suspicious US features.

### Ultrasound characteristics of the thyroid in children and adolescents with goiter: a single center experience [^c5aa46c8]. Thyroid (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Autoimmune thyroiditis (AIT) is a common cause of goiter in children, and sonographic changes have been reported in more than one-third at presentation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the ultrasound (US) characteristics of the thyroid and the prevalence of thyroid nodules in children and adolescents presenting with goiter in the presence or absence of AIT.

Methods

A retrospective review was conducted of the US characteristics of 154 children and adolescents aged <18 years of age with goiter from July 2008 to December 2010. US characteristics were analyzed according to each patient's age, sex, thyrotropin (TSH) levels, and thyroid peroxidase antibody titer (TPOAb). Heterogeneity and nodule prevalence were compared between antibody-positive and -negative goiter.

Results

Heterogeneity was more common in TPOAb-positive (59/71, 83%) compared to TPOAb-negative goiter (24/46, 52%; p<0.001), but there was no correlation between the presence of heterogeneity and TPOAb titer within the antibody-positive group. Nodules were equally prevalent in children with (17%) and without (17.4%) TPOAb, and there was no correlation between the serum TSH level or TPOAb titer and the presence of nodules. Papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) was diagnosed in 3/71 with positive TPOAb compared to 1/46 with negative antibodies. Pseudonodules were identified in 11/71 antibody-positive and none of the antibody-negative patients. However, during follow-up, two of these were later identified as nodules and one was PTC.

Conclusion

The majority of children and adolescents with goiter had positive TPOAb (71/117). Sonographic heterogeneity was more common among TPOAb-positive patients. However, thyroid nodules and PTC were equally common in both groups. Only 15% of the nodules and none of the PTC were palpable. These data support the utility of thyroid US to detect unsuspected thyroid nodules and PTC in children with goiter. Prospective follow-up studies of children with goiter are needed to formulate recommendations for evaluation with US and fine-needle aspiration.

### Prevalence of thyroid nodules and characteristics of thyroid ultrasound in children with goiter: a single center experience [^a15f636c]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Thyroid diseases are one of the most common endocrine problems in children and adolescents. In the United States, thyroid disorders are found in 3.7% of children and adolescents between the ages of 11 and 18 years; they also account for 13% of cases that present at endocrine clinics among Saudi adolescents. They usually present for medical attention due to either the presence of an enlarged thyroid gland (goiter), symptoms caused by an excess or deficiency of the thyroid hormone, or incidentally found during a routine biochemistry workup. In Saudi Arabia, the prevalence of goiters in schoolchildren aged 8 to 10 years was found to be < 5% in all regions, except for the Southern region, which has a prevalence of 12.7%.

Thyroid ultrasound (US) plays an important role in the evaluation of various thyroid diseases affecting children and adolescents. It is considered the most sensitive imaging tool for evaluating thyroid nodules and thyroid cancer. Preoperatively, US has a sensitivity of 86.5% for diagnosing nonfollicular neoplasm, and 18.2% for follicular neoplasm, and a specificity of 92.3% and 88.7%, respectively. Thyroid US has an important role in detecting focal thyroid disease in children and adolescents with diffuse thyroid goiter.

Thyroid nodules are less common in the pediatric population than in the adult population. However, the reported rate of malignancy in these nodules is significantly higher in the pediatric population. Solitary and large nodules, solid parenchyma, a shape that is taller than it is wide, speckled calcifications, irregular margins, and abnormal lymph nodes are all US findings that raise concerns about malignancy and indicate fine needle aspiration (FNA). Additionally, US findings are reliable in excluding autoimmune thyroiditis (AT); however, they have low sensitivity in distinguishing Hashimoto’s thyroiditis (HT) from Graves’ disease (GD).

AT, including HT and GD, is the most common thyroid disorder in pediatrics. GD is rare compared to HT in pediatrics. HT is more common and can present clinically as a painless, firm, diffuse goiter, often accompanied by hypothyroidism and autoantibodies. However, autoimmune antibodies, namely thyroid peroxidase (TPO) and anti-thyroglobulin (Tg) antibodies, can be absent in 20–50% of patients, highlighting the diagnostic value of thyroid US in evaluating patients who present with goiters.

### Thyroid ultrasound features and risk of carcinoma: a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies [^f6893bf9]. Thyroid (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

In the present meta-analysis, the US features associated with a higher risk and post-test probability of malignancy were taller than wide shape, absence of elasticity, presence of microcalcifications, and irregular margins. However, none of the US features analyzed singly had a clinically relevant positive likelihood ratio (>10) and post-test probabilities to suggest malignancy. Most likely, the use in combination may provide stronger risk and probability of malignancy. However, it was not possible to estimate the real risk of malignancy by using the combination of US features because very few studies have analyzed this aspect, and they differ regarding the selected features.

The strengths of the presents meta-analysis are the large number of nodules evaluated and the fact that all the nodules included had a histopathologic diagnosis, which is the reference method for the definite diagnosis of thyroid nodules. Moreover, the performance of US in nodules with indeterminate cytology was also analyzed, which constitutes the most challenging group of patients for clinical decision making. Another relevant aspect was the calculation of the likelihood ratio statistics, which summarizes how many times more (or less) likely patients with the disease are to have that particular result than patients without the disease. The likelihood ratio of a diagnostic test is more useful clinically than sensitivity and specificity. To the best of the authors' knowledge, there are no previous systematic reviews and meta-analyses that focus on histopathology only.

### Sonographic differentiation of asymptomatic diffuse thyroid disease from normal thyroid: a prospective study [^0fa6c620]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2010). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

There is no useful guide or study related to the differentiation of asymptomatic diffuse thyroid disease from normal thyroid by using thyroid US. This study was prospectively designed to evaluate the efficacy of the use of real-time thyroid sonography as performed by an experienced radiologist for the identification of asymptomatic DTD.

Materials and Methods

From January 2008 to December 2008, 2267 patients underwent thyroid sonography in our hospital by 1 radiologist. Each patient's thyroid was prospectively classified as being in 1 of 4 of the following diagnostic categories on the basis of the sonographic features as determined with the use of real-time sonography: suggestive for DTD, suspicious for DTD, indeterminate, and no evidence of DTD. We calculated the diagnostic efficacy of the sonographic classifications compared with the pathology results.

Results

Sonographic classifications for DTD in 340 patients who underwent thyroid surgery because of thyroid malignancy or other causes included the following: suggestive for DTD (n = 32), suspicious for DTD (n = 39), indeterminate (n = 18), and no evidence of DTD (n = 251). On the pathology, HT (n = 33), chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis (n = 27), diffuse hyperplasia (n = 2), and NTP (n = 278) were identified. There were true-positive cases (n = 50), true-negative cases (n = 244), false-positive cases (n = 21), and false-negative cases (n = 7). The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy for a diagnosis of asymptomatic DTD were 87.7%, 92.1%, 70.4%, 97.2%and 91.3%, respectively.

Conclusions

The present sonographic classification based on real-time sonography of the thyroid is a useful tool for differentiating asymptomatic DTD from normal thyroid.

In case of multifocal malignant nodule, various tumour foci are identified on US scan (A – C) as N1*, N3*, N4* and N5*, and reported on the diagram (D). Sum of each focus is calculated: 7 mm (upper right lobe) + 3 mm (lower right lobe) + 3 mm (isthmus) + 2 mm (isthmus) = 15 mm (pT1b) (D). Note that considering the only main tumour focus (N1) leads to pT1a diagnosis according to the TNM classification. Echogenic foci should be differentiated from comet tail artefacts and are considered as psammoma body microcalcifications and be reported

As reported by Ghai et al. we also note the presence of thyroiditis (reduction of thyroid gland echogenicity, reactive adenitis at level VI, positive serum anti-Thyroid peroxidase (ATPO) antibody level) when available, and label other non-suspicious nodules (Fig. 1). In lymphocytic thyroiditis and/or Grave’s disease settings, we agree with Ghai et al. regarding the difficulty of diagnosis and follow up of malignant hypoechoic nodules that may limit accurate reproducible measurements of thyroid nodules. Doppler US and microvascular imaging as well as elastography optimise delineation and accurate measurement in three dimensions of the target tumour. To better characterise isoechoic suspicious nodules, one should decrease the dynamic range settings to increase the contrast ratio between the target nodule and the contiguous thyroid gland.

### Correlation between sonography and antibody activity in patients with hashimoto thyroiditis [^bdff024a]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives

Patients with Hashimoto thyroiditis show structural changes of the thyroid that can be identified by a variety of sonographic criteria. We conducted this study to investigate whether there is a correlation between sonography and antibody activity and to assess the role of sonography in the diagnosis and follow-up of Hashimoto thyroiditis. In addition, we present a new classification system (termed the VESINC system [volume, echogenicity, sonographic texture, pseudonodular hypoechoic infiltration, nodules, and cysts]), which helps improve the clarity of sonographic findings.

Methods

The study included 223 consecutive patients with previously diagnosed Hashimoto autoimmune thyroiditis who attended the thyroid clinic of the German Armed Forces Central Hospital in Koblenz for follow-up examinations between 2006 and 2008. Laboratory tests were performed to measure the levels of free triiodothyronine, free thyroxine, thyrotropin, anti-thyroglobulin antibodies (TgAbs), and antithyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPOAbs). Sonography was performed according to a strict protocol. We then assessed whether a correlation existed between antibody activity and the 6 sonographic variables of the VESINC system.

Results

Hypoechogenicity, heterogeneity, and pseudonodular hypoechoic infiltration were associated with significantly higher TPOAb activity (P < .001). There were no significant correlations between the other sonographic variables examined (cysts, nodules, and volume) or the biometric data with the TPOAb and TgAb levels. In addition, an assessment of TgAb levels did not show significant differences in correlations with any of the sonographic variables.

Conclusions

Sonography is a noninvasive diagnostic imaging modality that provides information about the level of inflammatory activity. Markedly decreased echogenicity, heterogeneity, and multifocal pseudoinodular hypoechoic infiltration are indicative of a high level of inflammatory activity. The sonographic classification system presented here (VESINC system) can be a useful tool for comparing sonographic findings in a rapid and objective manner during follow-up of Hashimoto thyroiditis.

Indeterminate nodules show US features without definite malignant or benign characteristics, including isoechogenicity, mild hypoechogenicity, or hyperechogenicity; an ovoid-to-round shape; a smooth or ill-defined margin; and presence of continuous rim calcification. Probably benign nodules include simple cysts, predominantly (>50%) cystic nodules with reverberating artifacts, and isoechoic nodules with a spongiform appearance.

### Striving toward standardization of reporting of ultrasound features of thyroid nodules and lymph nodes: a multidisciplinary consensus statement [^e50976d1]. Thyroid (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The use of high-resolution ultrasound (US) imaging is a mainstay of the initial evaluation and long-term management of thyroid nodules and thyroid cancer. To fully capitalize on the diagnostic capabilities of a US examination in the context of thyroid disease, many clinicians consider it desirable to establish a universal format and standard of US reporting. The goals of this interdisciplinary consensus statement are twofold. First, to create a standardized set of US features to characterize thyroid nodules and cervical lymph nodes accurately, and second, to create a standardized system for tracking sequential changes in the US examination of thyroid nodules and cervical lymph nodes for the purpose of determining risk of malignancy.

Summary

The Thyroid, Head and Neck Cancer (THANC) Foundation convened a panel of nine specialists from a variety of medical disciplines that are actively involved in the diagnosis and treatment of thyroid nodules and thyroid cancer. Consensus was achieved on the following topics: US evaluation of the thyroid gland, US evaluation of thyroid nodules, US evaluation of cervical lymph nodes, US-guided fine needle aspiration (FNA) of thyroid nodules, and US-guided FNA of cervical lymph nodes.

Conclusion

We propose that this statement represents a consensus within a multidisciplinary team on the salient and essential elements of a comprehensive and clinically significant thyroid and neck US report with regards to content, terminology, and organization. This reporting protocol supplements previous US performance guidelines by not only capturing categories of findings that may have important clinical implications, but also delineating findings that are clinically relevant within those categories as specifically as possible. Additionally, we have included the specific features of diagnostic and therapeutic interventions that have not been previously addressed.

Ultrasound features across thyroid neoplasms—scope and limitations: Traditional ultrasound (US) features of malignancy were derived from series in which papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) was the most frequent thyroid tumor, and these sonographic findings are not completely shared by less common thyroid neoplasms such as follicular and Hürthle cell tumors and medullary thyroid cancer. Histologic variants of PTC may present US features different from the classic histotype.

Inflammatory lesions

Inflammatory thyroid disorders include acute infectious thyroiditis, Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, Riedel’s thyroiditis, and granulomatous thyroiditis (de Quervain’s). Hashimoto’s thyroiditis is associated with an increased risk of lymphoma and papillary thyroid carcinoma. The CT scan findings of thyroiditis are nonspecific and variable (Figs. 14, 15 and 16). The thyroid gland has a very high iodine concentration, resulting in high CT attenuation (80–100 Hounsfield Units). The presence of thyroiditis can be suggested by a diffusely enlarged and hypo-attenuating (around 45 Hounsfield Units) thyroid gland. This is probably due to follicular cell destruction and reduced thyroid iodine concentration. Marked homogenous enhancement is typically expected. Therefore, moderate thyroid enhancement in a case of thyroiditis suggests a diffuse inflammatory process. It is essential to clinically correlate this with a thyroid function test and serum autoantibody levels.

Fig. 4 
47-Year-old male with PTC in left thyroid lobe (arrow). The image illustrates incorrect placement of calipers for measurement of size (distances A and B on the image) of the PTC. Distance A and distance B have been measured in the plane of the thyroid gland, whereas ACR TI-RADS describes measurements should be recorded along the orientation of the nodule, i.e. axes of maximum dimension of the nodule in the transverse image and maximum dimension perpendicular to the first measurement. The two lines drawn perpendicular to one another in the image represent the accurate technique for measuring size of nodules. Inaccurate placement of calipers for measuring a PTC on AS at baseline or follow-up may lead to false impression of progression and discontinuation of AS

Apart from interobserver variability and accurate placement of calipers for reassessing size of nodule, there are other factors which may hinder accurate nodule size measurement at follow-up.

Background thyroid parenchyma

The echogenicity of the thyroid gland is normally higher than that of the adjacent strap muscles. The majority of micropapillary carcinomas and PTCs < 2 cm are well-defined nodules and manifest as hypoechoic echogenicity compared to the background thyroid parenchyma, which allows precise caliper placement and accurate nodule size measurement at baseline and follow-up. However, in the setting of thyroiditis the background thyroid parenchyma is altered and may have a diffusely heterogenous echotexture. A decrease in thyroid echogenicity with inflammatory hypoechoic areas in the setting of Hashimoto’s thyroiditis (HT) or Grave’s disease can therefore lead to loss of conspicuity of nodule margins and limit accurate reproducible measurements of thyroid nodules (Fig. 5). This makes it even more critical in patients on AS where a size discrepancy of 3 mm in any one plane at follow-up can lead to a false interpretation of disease progression and discontinuation of AS. Therefore, PTCs in patients with thyroiditis and heterogenous background thyroid echogenicity should be assessed carefully to evaluate eligibility for AS.

### Thyroid ultrasound features and risk of carcinoma: a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies [^896d1be1]. Thyroid (2015). Low credibility.

The present findings have important clinical implications. They reinforce that isolated US features on their own do not provide strong evidence to confirm (likelihood ratio>10) or rule out (likelihood ratio<0.1) a diagnosis of malignancy. The American Thyroid Association recommends the use of a combination of US features to select thyroid nodules that should be biopsied. Information about the probability of each US feature to be associated with malignancy would help the clinical decision to perform FNA biopsy.

The present findings also suggest that more accurate criteria are needed to recommend surgery in patients with indeterminate cytology. This is an important practical matter, since it would be helpful to select better which patients should be submitted to FNA and, specially, when surgery should be indicated in those nodules with indeterminate cytology.

Attempts have been made to improve patient selection in evaluation of thyroid nodules. Moon et al. evaluated a classification that considered as suspicious for malignancy a nodule that was solid plus having two additional risk features. Those authors found a sensitivity of 87.7%, a specificity of 97.8%, and an overall accuracy of 96.2%. A recent, retrospective case-control study of patients who underwent thyroid US reported three ultrasound nodule characteristics (microcalcifications, size >2 cm, and an entirely solid composition) as the only findings associated with the risk of thyroid cancer. However, this study has important aspects that limit its generalization such as the low prevalence of thyroid cancer and the definition of noncancerous nodules.

Thyroid nodule ultrasound classification—2014 BTA uses U categories from normal to malignant.

Painful goitre may also results from other diseases such as haemorrhage, infarction of thyroid nodule, Pneumocystis carinii infection and sometimes chronic thyroiditis or Graves` disease. However, these conditions are not associated with increased ESR and such inflammation markers as C-reactive protein or WBC, and are usually easy to differentiate from SAT. And most importantly, in these cases a slight delay in the diagnosis does not constitute a direct threat to the patient’s life.

The only method of distinguishing cancerous and SAT lesions in the described patients was neck US, in which the image of the thyroid cancer is usually different from the typical image of diffused hypoechoic areas in SAT. Therefore, US examination should be obligatory in every patient with suspected SAT. However, some features of the US image of malignant lesions may be similar to SAT, such as blurred lesion margins, hypoechogenity, or significantly reduced vascularisation. The same observation was presented by Pan et al. who evaluated sonographic features for distinguishing SAT from malignant thyroid nodules. They concluded that useful sonographic predictors of SAT are poorly defined margin, centripetal reduction of echogenicity and the absence of internal vascularity. However a considerable overlap of features of malignant nodules and SAT was observed. The decisive test should therefore be FNAB, especially when there are diagnostic doubts, and optimally in all patients with suspected SAT. In the opinion of the authors, the purpose of the FNAB is not to necessarily obtain a typical cytological image of SAT to confirm diagnosis, because it is not possible in every patient with SAT. The priority goal of FNAB should be to exclude malignancy that mimics SAT. Obtaining FNAB result typical for SAT provides final confirmation, but the absence of multinucleated macrophages does not exclude diagnosis if other criteria are met. If FNAB samples are non-diagnostic in a highly suspicious thyroid lesion, patient should be referred to thyroid surgery to make a proper diagnosis and to introduced adequate treatment. As it was presented in our cases and in the review of the literature, good response to glucocorticoids cannot serve as a marker of SAT, because the symptoms improvement was observed in most cases, even in thyroid cancer or metastasis.

### "Hypoechoic triangle": a new sonographic sign or marker of advanced autoimmune thyroiditis [^85415b4b]. Thyroid (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Ultrasonography (US) changes have been noted in patients with autoimmune thyroiditis (AT). Here, we report that some patients with late stage AT have a distinctive, previously unreported finding on US that we call the "hypoechoic triangle sign" (HET).

Methods

On US, the HET sign was characterized as a well-defined area of low echogenicity, about 10mm in diameter, between the lateral margin of one or both thyroid lobes, the medial wall of the carotid artery, and, posteriorly, the prevertebral muscles. Twenty-six patients with AT who had the HET sign (Group 1) were compared with 71 patients with AT who had normal serum thyrotropin (TSH) and free thyroid hormones levels (Group 2) and with 154 normal controls (Group 3). TSH was tested at least twice, first as part of their regular clinical care and then in follow-up. The groups were similar in terms of age, sex, and body mass index. Thyroid volume by US, TSH, free triiodothyronine, free thyroxine, antithyroid antibodies, and l-thyroxine treatment were evaluated. Sonographic gray-scale analysis and three-dimensional reconstruction of HET region were performed in five of the Group 1 patients.

Results

Thyroid volume was significantly smaller (p<0.01) in Group 1 than in Groups 2 and 3 (6.9±2.18 vs. 10.4±2.1 and 9.8±2.5mL, respectively). In Group 1, 61.5% of subjects were taking l-thyroxine for hypothyroidism; none of the Group 2 or 3 patients was taking thyroid hormone. Serum TSH was significantly higher (p<0.01) in Group 1 versus Groups 2 and 3 (3.6±1.3 vs. 2.18±1.4 and 1.9±1.1mIU/L, respectively). None of the Group 2 or 3 patients had the HET sign. Gray-scale US demonstrated an overlap between HET zone and the surrounding muscle tissue.

Conclusions

The HET sign seems to be specific for overt thyroid failure in patients with AT as it was not noted in patients with AT not having overt thyroid failure. The incidental finding of the HET sign during cervical US examination should prompt obtaining thyroid function tests to rule out hypothyroidism. Our study provides data regarding specificity but not sensitivity of the HET sign for AT and thyroid failure because a consecutive group of AT patients with thyroid failure was not studied. In addition, the specificity of the HET sign for AT needs to be evaluated further by studying a diverse group of thyroid diseases.

### Thyroid ultrasound features and risk of carcinoma: a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies [^d82b2813]. Thyroid (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Tin the general population, and their detection is increasing with the widespread use of ultrasound (US). The prevalence of thyroid nodularity varies from 19% to 67%, and increases with age, affecting about 50% of the population older than 40 years of age. The clinical significance of thyroid nodules relates to the need to exclude thyroid cancer, which is found in 5–15% of cases, depending on sex, age, and exposure to other risk factors. The incidence of thyroid cancer has increased about fivefold in the last 50 years, mostly due to small papillary thyroid cancers, the most indolent form of thyroid cancer.

Some US parameters, such as microcalcifications, hypoechogenicity, absence of a halo, increased intranodular vascularity, nodule shape or irregular margins, have been traditionally associated with increased risk of malignancies. However, none of these characteristics seems sufficiently reliable in isolation to diagnose malignancy. Diagnostic sensitivity ranges from 26.5% to 87.1% for hypoechogenicity, 54.3% to 74.3% for intranodular vascularity, and 26.1% to 59.1% for microcalcifications, whereas specificity ranges from 43.4% to 94.3%, 78.6% to 80.8%, and 85.8% to 95%, respectively. More recently, US determination of tissue elasticity (elastography) has been suggested to detect malignancy in thyroid nodules. A meta-analysis found a sensitivity of 92% and specificity of 90% using this technique. However, only a few studies were included, and only three used histopathology of surgical specimens for final diagnosis. Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy is considered the most accurate procedure to identify malignant nodules. To implement biopsies in all patients harboring a thyroid nodule is too burdensome, and the results of FNA have some limitations. The indications are broad and vague, and usually include patients with a family history of thyroid cancer, or those who have had significant radiation exposure, or those who have a combination of suspicious US features. However, there is no information about the probability of the US features associated with malignancy and which combination would be more clinically useful. US features may be also useful in clinical decision making for patients with FNA specimens insufficient for diagnosis (10%) or where specimens are indeterminate (15–30%), the latter carrying a 20–30% risk of malignancy. A recent meta-analysis evaluating the accuracy of US to predict malignancy in thyroid nodules found sensitivities ranging from 26% to 87%, and specificities from 40% to 93%. In this study, a taller than wide shape showed the highest diagnostic odds ratio (OR) for cancer. However, that meta-analysis included studies that used cytology, instead of histology, as a final diagnosis for benign nodules. Besides, it did not evaluate the accuracy of elastography to predict malignancy. Moreover, there was no description of the probability—likelihood ratio—of US characteristics associated with malignancy. The likelihood ratio would provide more information to be used in the clinical decision making of thyroid nodules than just sensitivity and specificity.

### Thyroid ultrasound features and risk of carcinoma: a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies [^072bb651]. Thyroid (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusions

The present results show that there is no isolated US feature capable of predicting malignancy in thyroid nodules with acceptable diagnostic accuracy. However, the presence of some US features, such as a microcalcifications, a taller than wide shape, irregular margins, central vascularization, or absence of elasticity probably, will identify nodules with an increased risk for malignancy. Ideally, meta-analyses should be performed with individual patient data, which would enable the creation of a risk classification for malignancy in thyroid nodules considering US features in combination and other risk factors to define better which patients should be submitted to FNA and surgery. Elastography is a new technique and may be a good tool to select patients at increased risk for thyroid malignancy. Nevertheless, more studies are required to standardize the technique and confirm its usefulness.

### The history of thyroid ultrasound: past, present, and future directions [^b7e9c7e4]. Endocrine Practice (2024). Medium credibility.

The rapid evolution of ultrasound (US) technology has dramatically changed the medical field. Ideally suited for evaluation of anatomic disorders of the thyroid, coupled with its ease of use at the bedside, US has become an essential tool for endocrinologists over the last 50 years. This noninvasive technology provides a sensitive and specific instrument for malignancy risk prediction of thyroid nodules, surveillance for recurrent thyroid cancer, and diagnosis of autoimmune thyroid disorders. While US has proven invaluable for such diagnostic purposes, its extensive use also has resulted in important negative consequences. This review will discuss the evolution of US equipment for the evaluation of thyroid disorders, its use in interventional procedures, and the unintended outcomes from the widespread adoption of this technology. Finally, this article will explore the potential future applications for US technology and its related advancements.

Thyroid nodule fine-needle aspiration (FNA) indications—ultrasonography (US)-guided and size/feature thresholds—state that thyroid FNA should always be performed under US guidance; nodules <5 mm should be monitored with US rather than biopsied; FNA should be considered for nodules with a major diameter ≤5–10 mm only when suspicious US signs are present in association with pathologic lymph nodes or extrathyroidal spread; FNA is also appropriate with a personal or family history of thyroid cancer or suspicious clinical or imaging findings; FNA should be performed on nodules >10 mm lacking suspicious US and/or clinical findings but without a definite benign appearance; for spongiform, isohyperechoic, or predominantly (>50%) cystic nodules without suspicious US findings, FNA should be performed only when nodules are ≥20 mm or progressively increasing in size; functioning nodules on scintigraphy without suspicious US features can be excluded from FNA.

Material and Methods

Search strategy

MEDLINE was searched using the following medical subject heading terms: “Thyroid Nodule”[MeSH] AND (“Ultrasonography”[MeSH] OR “ultrasonography”[Subheading] OR “Ultrasonography, Doppler”[MeSH]). EMBASE was searched using EmTree terms “Thyroid nodule” and “Ultrasonography.” The search period ended in July 2012. A manual search of the references of review articles, previous meta-analyses, and key articles was also performed. All potentially eligible studies were considered for review regardless of the primary outcome or language.

Study selection

Observational studies of patients with thyroid nodules evaluated by US and submitted to thyroidectomy regardless of the reason for surgery were considered for inclusion. Only studies with histopathologic diagnosis of surgical specimens were considered. Two independent investigators (L.R.R. and C.K.K.) selected potentially eligible studies based on titles and abstracts. All the studies selected were retrieved for full-text evaluation. Disagreements were solved by a third investigator (C.B.L.).

Data extraction and quality assessment

Two investigators reviewed the selected studies for patient characteristics, US features, and histopathologic results. Any discrepancies between the data extracted were discussed until a consensus was reached. The absolute number of patients with and without the evaluated features and with and without malignancy was extracted. These data were entered into a computerized spreadsheet considering true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.

The diagnostic ability to diagnose thyroid malignancy of the following US features was evaluated: solid structure, hypoechogenicity, irregular margins, absence of halo, microcalcifications, central vascularization, solitary nodule, heterogeneity, taller than wide shape, and absence of elasticity. The presence of these features was defined as described in the original study.

Two independent investigators (L.R.R. and L.C.F.P.) evaluated the quality of the included studies using the QUADAS-2 tool. Any disagreements were solved by a third investigator (CBL). The present meta-analysis was described according to proposed by Stroup et al. Details are available in Supplementary Table S1 (Supplementary Data are available online at).

Goiter

A goiter is an abnormal thyroid gland proliferation that manifests as multi-nodular, uni-nodular, or non-nodular diffuse glandular enlargement. A goiter is formed of solid matrix, colloid cysts, blood products, calcification, and fibrosis, and this heterogeneity may lead to variable appearances on a CT scan (Figs. 13, 14 and 15). US is more sensitive in evaluating thyroid nodules within a goiter; however, a symptomatic goiter may require surgical treatment with total thyroidectomy, and in this case CT plays an additional role in preoperative evaluation. Specific aspects for examination on a CT scan during the preoperative evaluation for goiter include extension, mass effect, and suspicious features of malignancy.

### Diagnostic use of ultrasonography in patients with nodular thyroid disease [^4fe441a3]. Endocrine Practice (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the published reports pertaining to the diagnostic utility of ultrasonography for evaluation of thyroid nodules.

Methods

Various roles for diagnostic thyroid ultrasonography and screening ultrasound studies of the thyroid are discussed, and ultrasound characteristics of thyroid nodules and their association with malignant potential are described.

Results

In two studies that correlated ultrasound findings with physical examination findings in patients with a solitary thyroid nodule detected by palpation, 16% of such patients had no corresponding nodule evident on ultrasonography, and 45% of such patients had an additional nodule detected by ultrasonography. Similarly, approximately 18% of patients with a palpable multinodular thyroid had no nodules larger than 1 cm in diameter on ultrasound studies. Thyroid nodules larger than 1 cm have been found by ultrasonography to be present in from 2 to almost 5% of the population with normal findings on examination of the thyroid. Use of screening ultrasound study of the thyroid has been suggested for patients with a history of childhood irradiation to the head and neck or a family history of thyroid cancer. Numerous investigations that have evaluated ultrasound features of thyroid nodules have suggested five characteristics as suggestive of malignant potential--hypoechogenicity, microcalcifications, irregular or microlobulated border, absent or irregular thick halo, and increased intranodular vascularity.

Conclusion

Correlation of ultrasound and palpation findings will provide a comprehensive evaluation of nodular thyroid disease. Moreover, real-time ultrasonography facilitates characterization of features associated with an increased risk of a malignant lesion. High-resolution thyroid ultrasonography is a dynamic tool for endocrinologists.

### Thyroid nodule ultrasound: technical advances and future horizons [^359fda0b]. Insights Into Imaging (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Ultrasound (US) examination of the neck is a commonly performed investigation and thyroid nodules are a highly prevalent finding. As the vast majority of nodules are non-malignant, the accurate discrimination of a benign from cancerous lesion is an important and challenging feature of thyroid US. Whilst single US features remain of limited accuracy, constellations of findings enable thyroid nodules to be accurately stratified on a ‘risk-of-malignancy’ basis and form the basis of several guidelines. Imaging features that confer a high positive predictive value and specificity for malignancy are valuable as they enable suspicious lesions to be identified and targeted for pathological analysis (typically fine-needle aspiration cytology, FNAC). The ubiquitous nature of thyroid nodules and the limitations of cytology mean that the confident identification of benign nodules is also important. US characteristics that carry a high negative predictive value for malignancy enable an evidence-based decision not to investigate further, allowing unnecessary FNAC and/or surgery to be avoided in a very large population. Many of these key thyroid nodule features are heavily dependent on recent advances in high-resolution ultrasound technology and are therefore altered and influenced by US machine settings. In an era of wider US use by different groups (e.g. endocrinologists, surgeons), the high-resolution features of thyroid disease—and the technical factors, which create and alter these valuable signs—must be familiar to the operator.

US elastography (USE) is a recent technological advance that measures tissue elasticity or stiffness properties objectively and has been available in recent years on many state-of-the-art clinical US machines. USE is classified as diagnostic ultrasound and is safe, non-invasive and requires no costly consumables. Importantly, USE can be performed in real-time alongside conventional sonography, providing objective stiffness data that can be used to influence clinical decisions during US examinations. The clinical potential of USE relies on the same principles as clinical palpation, namely that processes such as malignancy and fibrosis alter elasticity. Numerous clinical applications of USE are under investigation at different body sites. To date, over 100 preliminary studies on USE for thyroid nodules for malignancy have been published, with promising but controversial results, as will be discussed.

This article will focus on two aspects of thyroid ultrasound: first, technical advances in high-resolution US are discussed with relevance to specific features of thyroid cancer, benign disease and emerging developments. The second part of the article provides a concise overview of the current role of elastography and how elasticity imaging may supplement high-resolution ultrasound in the pursuit of accurate thyroid nodule assessment.

Thyroid nodules are extremely common findings with a low likelihood of harboring a clinically significant malignancy. Ultrasound is highly sensitive at identifying which nodules warrant further workup with fine needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy. FNA should be performed based on US findings and risk categories. The Bethesda system should be used to classify FNA results. Molecular testing may be offered if the results are likely to change the therapeutic approach. Clinicians should be keenly aware of the potential for overtreatment and should make a concerted effort to factor patient values into the decision-making process.

The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2, has devastated the world since its emergence in 2019.Although the leading cause of death associated with COVID-19 is acute respiratory distress syndrome,other complications associated with COVID-19 have been reported, including acute kidney injury, pulmonary embolism, acute myocarditis, and septic shock.

Currently, subacute thyroiditis (SAT), potentially invoked by SARS-CoV-2 infection, has been reported as a possible complication associated with COVID-19. SAT can be caused by multiple triggers, including viral infection, post-inflammatory processes, and autoimmunity. Patients with SAT exhibit fever, neck pain, and a tender diffuse goiter as well as abnormalities in serum thyroid hormones. The clinical characteristics and outcomes of SAT after COVID-19 remain incompletely defined.

In the present study, we gathered information on SAT after COVID-19 from case reports available in digital databases and described its clinical practice patterns, clinical symptoms, and outcomes. We aimed to examine the collected data on SAT after COVID-19 to further understand the relationship between SAT and COVID-19.

Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) indications—As a general rule, which may be modified on the basis of the clinical setting and operator expertise, we recommend the following: in light of the low clinical risk, nodules <5 mm should be monitored rather than biopsied irrespective of their sonographic appearance; in nodules with a major diameter of 5 to 10 mm that are associated with suspicious ultrasound (US) signs, consider either FNA sampling or watchful waiting, and FNA is recommended for subcapsular or paratracheal lesions, suspicious lymph nodes or extrathyroid spread, positive personal or family history of thyroid cancer, history of head and neck irradiation, or coexistent suspicious clinical findings (e.g., dysphonia); in nodules >10 mm with suspicious US signs, FNA is always recommended.

Investigations

Thyroid ultrasonography showed a slightly heterogeneous, enlarged thyroid gland with an estimated thyroid volume of 26.8 mL and normal Doppler flow. The thyroid gland was slightly enlarged compared with that at the initial examination (figures 3 and 4). The nodule in the left lobe of the thyroid gland and parathyroid gland enlargement had not changed since the initial examination. Her 20 min technetium-99m thyroid scintigraphy uptake was 0.63% (normal uptake: 0.5–3.0%) (figure 5).
