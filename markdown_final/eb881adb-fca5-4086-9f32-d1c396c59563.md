## Question

Clopidogrel to eradicate Helicobacter pylori gastritis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether clopidogrel can be used to eradicate Helicobacter pylori gastritis and how to manage H. pylori therapy in someone who needs clopidogrel. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether clopidogrel has any role against H. pylori at all. Then, I should verify the evidence-based first-line eradication regimens and their durations. Next, I need to check the clinical relevance of the proton pump inhibitor–clopidogrel interaction and whether specific PPIs are preferable. After that, I will consider a practical management approach that balances cardiovascular protection and successful H. pylori eradication. Finally, I should confirm post-treatment testing and address common sources of confusion that may have prompted the question.

> Let me first confirm the fundamental premise: clopidogrel is an antiplatelet P2Y12 inhibitor used for cardiovascular protection; it is not an antibacterial agent and has no role in H. pylori eradication — so using clopidogrel to treat H. pylori gastritis is a misconception, and eradication requires antibiotics plus potent acid suppression according to contemporary guidelines [^114qTnSw] [^112huKk5].

> Next, I should review guideline-concordant first-line therapies and their durations. Optimized bismuth quadruple therapy for 14 days is preferred in most settings: a standard-dose PPI twice daily with bismuth, tetracycline, and metronidazole; non-bismuth concomitant therapy for 14 days is an alternative where clarithromycin resistance is low, while clarithromycin triple therapy should be restricted to regions with demonstrated low resistance and no prior macrolide exposure; critically, 14-day courses outperform shorter regimens and should be the default [^114qTnSw] [^111BpyUH] [^116GgZ9o] [^116VE7dV].

> Wait, let me verify the PPI–clopidogrel interaction because PPIs are integral to every H. pylori regimen and many patients on clopidogrel also require GI protection. Mechanistically, some PPIs inhibit CYP2C19 and can reduce clopidogrel's active metabolite exposure, but the clinical significance is debated: an FDA-reviewed study with lansoprazole showed only a modest 14% reduction deemed not clinically important; a large randomized trial (COGENT) found omeprazole reduced GI events without increasing cardiovascular events, whereas earlier observational analyses suggested harm; clinically, many prefer PPIs with less CYP2C19 inhibition (for example, pantoprazole or rabeprazole) when feasible to minimize theoretical interaction risk [^116spsoS] [^114ea42q] [^111RdMg2].

> Hold on, I should not jump to conclusions — what is the pragmatic path when a patient on clopidogrel needs H. pylori therapy? I will now examine a balanced approach: continue clopidogrel for cardiovascular protection; select a 14-day optimized bismuth quadruple regimen with a standard-dose PPI, favoring a PPI with lower CYP2C19 inhibition if options allow; if concerned, separate PPI and clopidogrel dosing by several hours though evidence for timing strategies is limited; and monitor for ischemic symptoms while prioritizing eradication efficacy because robust acid suppression improves antibiotic performance and clinical outcomes [^114qTnSw] [^111RdMg2] [^116sx8jh].

> I need to ensure the post-treatment plan is correct. Let me first confirm eradication testing: use a urea breath test or stool antigen at least four weeks after completing antibiotics and after withholding PPIs long enough to avoid false negatives; if eradication fails, select a regimen that avoids previously used antibiotics and consider rifabutin-based or other guideline-supported options because resistance and adherence issues drive failure [^112fSwVk] [^1124Jqta] [^114qTnSw].

> But wait, what if the question stems from the aspirin/ulcer-bleeding literature that sometimes gets conflated with clopidogrel and H. pylori? I should double-check this. In high-risk aspirin users with prior ulcer bleeding, H. pylori eradication plus PPI maintenance reduces rebleeding risk; notably, a randomized trial showed aspirin plus esomeprazole was safer than switching to clopidogrel monotherapy for preventing recurrent ulcer bleeding after ulcer healing, and eradication more broadly lowers rebleeding compared with antisecretory therapy alone — points that may be misinterpreted as clopidogrel being a "GI-safer" alternative rather than addressing H. pylori directly [^111Su8Bx] [^114ajWYN] [^115uR65D].

> Hmm, wait a minute — I initially thought we should categorically avoid omeprazole with clopidogrel during eradication, but I should verify whether that's truly necessary. The randomized COGENT trial did not show an increase in adverse cardiovascular events with omeprazole and did show a GI benefit, so while mechanistic and observational concerns exist, absolute contraindication is not supported; still, when equivalent options exist, choosing PPIs with less CYP2C19 inhibition is a reasonable risk-mitigation step without compromising eradication efficacy [^116sx8jh] [^114ea42q] [^111RdMg2].

> Next, I should review resistance-informed choices in case of failure. Rising clarithromycin, metronidazole, and fluoroquinolone resistance mandates avoidance of previously used classes; after a clarithromycin-containing failure, bismuth quadruple therapy is recommended, and after bismuth quadruple failure, levofloxacin- or rifabutin-based regimens or high-dose dual amoxicillin/PPI strategies can be considered, with rifabutin and amoxicillin resistance remaining rare; avoid clarithromycin- or levofloxacin-based regimens when there is prior macrolide or fluoroquinolone exposure because of high resistance likelihood [^117MmN6H] [^116H3rrn] [^1124Jqta] [^116Rqvzv].

> Let me reconsider the essentials and synthesize the recommendations. Clopidogrel has no role in H. pylori eradication; treat H. pylori with 14-day, guideline-endorsed antibiotic regimens anchored by potent acid suppression; in patients who require clopidogrel, continue antiplatelet therapy, select an effective eradication regimen with an appropriate PPI while recognizing that the clinical impact of the PPI–clopidogrel interaction appears limited in randomized data, and confirm cure with nonserologic testing after therapy; choose subsequent regimens based on prior antibiotic exposure and local resistance patterns to maximize success and minimize resistance [^114qTnSw] [^116sx8jh] [^112fSwVk] [^111Q6RBZ].

Clopidogrel **does not eradicate Helicobacter pylori gastritis**. It is an antiplatelet agent [^116sx8jh] with no antibacterial activity against H. pylori, and **no clinical evidence supports its use** for eradication [^112hCqoz]. Standard therapy remains **antibiotic-based regimens** with acid suppression [^114qTnSw], and clopidogrel should only be used for its approved cardiovascular indications.

---

## Pharmacological properties of clopidogrel

Clopidogrel is a thienopyridine antiplatelet agent that **irreversibly inhibits the P2Y12 ADP receptor** on platelets, reducing aggregation and thrombosis [^116sx8jh]. It is a prodrug activated by hepatic CYP enzymes, notably CYP2C19 [^116spsoS], and is used to prevent cardiovascular events in patients with atherosclerotic disease, acute coronary syndromes, and after percutaneous coronary interventions.

---

## Mechanism of action and relevance to H. pylori

Clopidogrel's mechanism is limited to platelet inhibition, and it has **no known antibacterial activity** against H. pylori. Eradication requires antibiotics that target bacterial cell wall synthesis, protein synthesis, or DNA replication — none of which are affected by clopidogrel [^113WRKai].

---

## Clinical evidence regarding clopidogrel and H. pylori eradication

There is **no clinical evidence** supporting clopidogrel for H. pylori eradication [^112huKk5]. No randomized controlled trials, observational studies, or case reports demonstrate efficacy against H. pylori infection or gastritis.

---

## Current clinical guidelines for H. pylori eradication

Current guidelines from major gastroenterological societies recommend antibiotic-based regimens with acid suppression for H. pylori eradication:

- **ACG 2024 guidelines**: Recommend optimized bismuth quadruple therapy (PPI, bismuth, tetracycline, metronidazole) or concomitant therapy (PPI, clarithromycin, amoxicillin, metronidazole) as first-line treatments [^114qTnSw].

- **Toronto consensus 2016**: Recommends 14-day regimens, including bismuth quadruple therapy and concomitant therapy, as first-line options [^112hCqoz].

- **AGA 2021 guidelines**: Emphasize antibiotic resistance and recommend susceptibility-guided therapy for refractory infections [^112fq9qC] [^117BMfs9].

Clopidogrel is **not mentioned in any guideline** as a treatment for H. pylori infection or gastritis [^114qTnSw] [^112huKk5].

---

## Potential risks and adverse effects of clopidogrel use

Clopidogrel carries significant risks — particularly gastrointestinal bleeding — relevant to patients with gastritis or peptic ulcer disease:

- **Gastrointestinal bleeding**: Clopidogrel increases the risk of GI bleeding, especially in patients with pre-existing gastritis or ulcers [^111Su8Bx].

- **Drug interactions**: Clopidogrel interacts with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), commonly used in H. pylori eradication regimens, potentially reducing its antiplatelet efficacy [^116spsoS] [^111RdMg2].

- **Cardiovascular risks**: Clopidogrel is associated with increased cardiovascular events when combined with certain PPIs, although evidence is mixed [^114ea42q] [^116sx8jh].

Given these risks, clopidogrel should be used only for approved cardiovascular indications and **not for H. pylori eradication**.

---

## Comparison with standard H. pylori eradication therapies

Standard H. pylori eradication therapies involve antibiotic combinations with acid suppression and achieve eradication rates of 80–90% [^113WRKai]. Clopidogrel lacks antibacterial activity, **would not achieve eradication**, and may increase gastrointestinal bleeding risk [^111Su8Bx].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Clopidogrel **does not eradicate Helicobacter pylori gastritis** [^112huKk5]. It lacks antibacterial activity against H. pylori, and no clinical evidence supports its use for this purpose. Current guidelines recommend antibiotic-based regimens with acid suppression for H. pylori eradication [^114qTnSw]. Clopidogrel should be used only for approved cardiovascular indications, given its potential risks, especially gastrointestinal bleeding [^111Su8Bx].

### Influence of gastritis on cyclooxygenase-2 expression before and after eradication of Helicobacter pylori infection [^112CQ44g]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2004). Low credibility.

Helicobacter pylori infection causes chronic gastritis and induces cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 expression. The relationship between gastritis and COX-2 expression is not well understood, especially long after the organism has been eradicated. We designed a study to elucidate this relationship.

- **Methods**: Four endoscopic gastric biopsies from each of 118 H. pylori-infected subjects were assessed for COX-2 expression immunohistochemically, gastritis, by an updated Sydney System. In the 107 successfully eradicated subjects, the assessment was repeated once yearly for 3 years.

- **Results**: After successful eradication, COX-2 expression was reduced significantly regardless of site. Atrophy improved significantly, and intestinal metaplasia improved but not in the antrum greater curvature. After 1 year, COX-2 expression was not significantly different in the epithelia with and without intestinal metaplasia. The correlation between COX-2 expression and neutrophil score in the antrum (r = 0.214, P = 0.042) and inflammation in the corpus (r = 0.234, P = 0.025) disappeared after eradication. COX-2 expression correlated well with atrophy and metaplasia before and after eradication. No significant reduction in COX-2 or improvement in gastritis was found in subjects with eradication failure.

- **Conclusion**: H. pylori infection is associated with the enhancement of COX-2 expression in the gastric mucosa. Eradication therapy reduces COX-2 expression and hence may reduce the risk of cancer development.

### Evolving concepts in Helicobacter pylori management [^115mknV7]. Gastroenterology (2024). Low credibility.

Helicobacter pylori is the most common chronic bacterial infection worldwide and the most significant risk factor for gastric cancer, which remains a leading cause of cancer-related death globally. H. pylori and gastric cancer continue to disproportionately impact racial and ethnic minority and immigrant groups in the United States. The approach to H. pylori case-finding thus far has relied on opportunistic testing based on symptoms or high-risk indicators, such as racial or ethnic background and family history. However, this approach misses a substantial proportion of individuals infected with H. pylori who remain at risk for gastric cancer because most infections remain clinically silent.

Moreover, individuals with chronic H. pylori infection are at risk for gastric preneoplastic lesions, which are also asymptomatic and only reliably diagnosed using endoscopy and biopsy. Thus, to make a significant impact in gastric cancer prevention, a systematic approach is needed to better identify individuals at highest risk of both H. pylori infection and its complications, including gastric preneoplasia and cancer. The approach to H. pylori eradication must also be optimized given sharply decreasing rates of successful eradication with commonly used therapies and increasing antimicrobial resistance.

With growing acceptance that H. pylori should be managed as an infectious disease and the increasing availability of susceptibility testing, we now have the momentum to abandon empirical therapies demonstrated to have inadequate eradication rates. Molecular-based susceptibility profiling facilitates targeted therapy approaches with higher chances of success.

### Helicobacter pylori eradication following first-line treatment failure in Europe: What, how and when chose among different standard regimens? A systematic review [^116jq4D5]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2021). Low credibility.

Cure rates following standard first-line regimens for Helicobacter pylori eradication are decreasing, leading to several patients requiring two or more treatments. Although antibiotic susceptibility-based therapy is advised in guidelines, it is largely impracticable in clinical practice. Some 'standard' regimens, such as triple therapies based on either levofloxacin or rifabutin, bismuth-based quadruple therapies, sequential, concomitant, and hybrid therapies, were empirically used as rescue therapies. We performed a systematic review of recent studies carried out in European countries dealing with these regimens.

A total of 24 studies, involving 3804 patients, were identified.

- **Second-line therapy**: Pylera (89.2%) and sequential therapy (92.5%) achieved significantly higher cure rates compared to all other regimens.
- **Third-line therapy**: Levofloxacin-based therapy (84.1%) and Pylera (83.6%) achieved similarly high cure rates, whereas standard, bismuth-based quadruple therapy (64.1%) achieved the lowest.
- **Rescue therapy**: The success rate was approximately 75% following all therapies used, with data on rifabutin-based regimen consolidated by a larger sample size.

Overall, levofloxacin-amoxicillin triple therapy achieved higher eradication rates when the 14-day regimen was used rather than the 10-day regimen (87.1% vs. 72.2%; P = 0.003). Among bismuth-based therapies, Pylera achieved a significantly higher eradication rate than standard quadruple therapy (88% vs. 67%; P < 0.0001). These data suggest that a wise 'therapeutic package' following first-line therapy could include Pylera, levofloxacin, and rifabutin-based therapy.

### Lansoprazole [^116spsoS]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

In clinical trials, antacids were administered concomitantly with lansoprazole, and there was no evidence of a change in the efficacy of lansoprazole.

- **Clopidogrel**: Clopidogrel is metabolized to its active metabolite in part by CYP2C19. A study of healthy subjects who were CYP2C19 extensive metabolizers, receiving once-daily administration of clopidogrel 75 mg alone or concomitantly with lansoprazole 30 mg (n = 40) for nine days, was conducted. The mean AUC of the active metabolite of clopidogrel was reduced by approximately 14% (mean AUC ratio was 86%, with 90% CI of 80 to 92%) when lansoprazole was coadministered compared to administration of clopidogrel alone. Pharmacodynamic parameters were also measured and demonstrated that the change in inhibition of platelet aggregation (induced by 5 mcM ADP) was related to the change in exposure to the clopidogrel active metabolite. The effect on exposure to the active metabolite of clopidogrel and on clopidogrel-induced platelet inhibition is not considered clinically important.

- **Effect of other drugs on lansoprazole**: Because lansoprazole is metabolized by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4, inducers and inhibitors of these enzymes may potentially alter the exposure of lansoprazole.

### Ulcer and gastritis [^115NJa9U]. Endoscopy (2002). Low credibility.

The literature on peptic ulcer and gastritis in 2000 focused on Helicobacter pylori, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and gastric cancer. New diagnostic tests for H. pylori infection were evaluated, and rescue therapies for failed H. pylori eradication were tested. The causal relationship between H. pylori infection and conditions such as nonulcer dyspepsia, gastric cancer, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and NSAID-related ulcers remained topics of debate. Landmark clinical trials and meta-analyses addressing these issues were published in 2000.

The role of endoscopy in managing nonulcer dyspepsia became better defined. Researchers reexamined the role of H. pylori eradication in high-risk NSAID/aspirin users. Specific inhibitors of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) were confirmed to offer clinical benefits. Overall, the year 2000 was significant for advancements in this field.

### Risk of adverse outcomes associated with concomitant use of clopidogrel and proton pump inhibitors following acute coronary syndrome [^114ea42q]. JAMA (2009). Low credibility.

Prior mechanistic studies reported that omeprazole decreases the platelet inhibitory effects of clopidogrel, yet the clinical significance of these findings is not clear.

To assess outcomes of patients taking clopidogrel with or without a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) after hospitalization for acute coronary syndrome (ACS), a retrospective cohort study was conducted. This study included 8205 patients with ACS taking clopidogrel after discharge from 127 Veterans Affairs hospitals between October 1, 2003, and January 31, 2006. Vital status information was available for all patients through September 30, 2006.

- **Main outcome measures**: All-cause mortality or rehospitalization for ACS.

Results showed that of the 8205 patients taking clopidogrel after discharge, 63.9% (n = 5244) were prescribed PPI at discharge, during follow-up, or both, while 36.1% (n = 2961) were not prescribed PPI. Death or rehospitalization for ACS occurred in 20.8% (n = 615) of patients taking clopidogrel without PPI and 29.8% (n = 1561) of patients taking clopidogrel plus PPI. In multivariable analyses, use of clopidogrel plus PPI was associated with an increased risk of death or rehospitalization for ACS compared with use of clopidogrel without PPI (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 1.25; 95% confidence interval, 1.11–1.41). Among patients taking clopidogrel after hospital discharge and prescribed PPI at any point during follow-up (n = 5244), periods of use of clopidogrel plus PPI (compared with periods of use of clopidogrel without PPI) were associated with a higher risk of death or rehospitalization for ACS.

### The value of Helicobacter eradication in long-term aspirin users [^114jjgYW]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2018). Low credibility.

In summary, the results from Cheung et al. indicate that there is no loss of aspirin's risk reduction effect for gastric cancer when H. pylori is tested for and eradicated. It would be reassuring to also see data for those who tested negative and for other GI cancers for which aspirin has been shown to be preventive, although it seems likely that there would not be an effect of H. pylori on them. As H. pylori infection is still quite prevalent among middle-aged individuals throughout the world, and GI bleeding is the major side effect of regular aspirin use, these results suggest that Helicobacter pylori testing and eradication should be considered before the commencement of long-term prophylactic aspirin use for cancer or cardiovascular disease prevention.

### Comparison of the effect of clarithromycin triple therapy with or without acetylcysteine in the eradication of: a randomized controlled trial [^115q5okb]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Helicobacter pylori infection is associated with peptic ulcer disease and gastric cancer, and population-wide eradication seems to be the most direct approach to reduce the enormous consequences of H. pylori infection. Implementation of H. pylori eradication programs requires an effective, simple, and practical antibiotic regimen. However, the efficacy of standard triple therapy containing clarithromycin, amoxicillin, and a proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) for H. pylori eradication has fallen below 80% due to the rising prevalence of clarithromycin resistance.

Several strategies have been developed to increase the efficacy of first-line H. pylori eradication therapies. Previous studies showed that H. pylori produce biofilm, an extracellular polymeric matrix (polysaccharides, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), proteins, and lipids) with water channels as a strategy to overcome environmental stress and protect itself. Bacteria in biofilms can be more resistant to antibiotics and human defenses than free-living ones by retarding antibiotic diffusion, allowing expression of gene resistance, presence of antibiotic-hydrolyzing enzymes, and decreasing the bacterial growth ratio.

Yonezawa et al. showed that H. pylori biofilm formation decreases the susceptibility to clarithromycin, and that H. pylori clarithromycin-resistant mutations are more frequently generated in biofilms than in planktonic cells. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) has anti-biofilm activity against pathogens and was used in treating device-related infection and chronic respiratory traction diseases.

### The Toronto consensus for the treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection in adults [^116GgZ9o]. Gastroenterology (2016). High credibility.

With regard to medical management of Helicobacter pylori infection, specifically in terms of first-line regimens, the CAG 2016 guidelines recommend restricting the use of PPI triple therapies (PPI, amoxicillin/metronidazole, and clarithromycin) to areas with known low clarithromycin resistance (85%).

### Peptic ulcer disease and H. pylori infection: Common questions and answers [^111BpyUH]. American Family Physician (2023). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for Helicobacter pylori infection, particularly in relation to first-line regimens, the AAFP 2023 guidelines recommend administering either bismuth quadruple therapy — consisting of a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), bismuth, tetracycline, and metronidazole or tinidazole — or concomitant therapy, which is a non-bismuth quadruple therapy comprising a PPI, clarithromycin, amoxicillin, and metronidazole or tinidazole, as first-line treatment for patients with H. pylori infection.

### Eradication of H. pylori infection: the challenge is on if standard therapy fails [^114j8WPf]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2009). Low credibility.

The recommended standard triple therapy for Helicobacter pylori infection, consisting of a proton pump inhibitor, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin or metronidazole, can reach eradication rates of over 90%. However, in recent years, resistance to antibiotics has increased, and eradication rates have declined. Approximately one in five patients need a second-line therapy because eradication therapy fails.

- **Second-line treatments**: Treatment with a bismuth-based quadruple therapy leads to satisfactory eradication rates, but bismuth is not available in many countries. Modern second- and third-line treatments can only be successful if they are adapted to the resistance situation and need to evolve continuously.

Moreover, pharmacodynamic effects due to polymorphisms of the cytochrome P450 system are important. Because therapy adherence is significantly associated with therapy success, modern regimens, if possible, should be easy to take and well tolerated. In recent years, various novel salvage-therapy regimens have been investigated that significantly improve treatment options.

### Rates of antimicrobial resistance in Helicobacter pylori isolates from clinical trial patients across the US and Europe [^111Q6RBZ]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Helicobacter pylori currently infects over half of the world's population. Infection causes chronic gastritis and is the major risk factor for peptic ulcer disease, gastric adenocarcinoma, and gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma. Therapies that were developed in the 1990s include the combination of a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), clarithromycin, and amoxicillin. Although these are still used globally, eradication rates have declined sharply during the last decade, due mainly to increased clarithromycin resistance.

Resistance rates to some of the antibiotics commonly used for the treatment of H. pylori infection are high; a global meta-analysis identified H. pylori primary and secondary resistance rates to clarithromycin, metronidazole, and levofloxacin of more than 15% in nearly all regions. Furthermore, the use of these antibiotics for other indications is widespread and increasing. In Europe, resistance of H. pylori to clarithromycin and levofloxacin has been linked to the widespread use of macrolides and fluoroquinolones, respectively. Consequently, recent guidelines have noted the effect of prior antibiotic exposure on susceptibility and recommend that antibiotic history be taken into account in treatment decision-making.

In Europe, resistance rates to macrolides ranged from 4.8% to 36.9% in 2018. In the US, contemporary data are limited, with most studies confined to small geographic regions or limited in the number of subjects evaluated. In a recent US clinical trial, antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) data from 345 patients showed significant trends in resistance patterns.

### British Society of Gastroenterology guidelines on the diagnosis and management of patients at risk of gastric adenocarcinoma [^111Fjpiw]. Gut (2019). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of atrophic gastritis, specifically in connection with H. pylori eradication, the BSG 2019 guidelines recommend initiating H. pylori eradication therapy. This approach aims to reduce the risk of gastric adenocarcinoma development in patients with atrophic gastritis.

### The Toronto consensus for the treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection in adults [^1114UCd6]. Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

The Helicobacter pylori infection is increasingly difficult to treat. The purpose of these consensus statements is to provide a review of the literature and specific, updated recommendations for eradication therapy in adults.

- **Methods**: A systematic literature search identified studies on H. pylori treatment. The quality of evidence and strength of recommendations were rated according to the Grading of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. Statements were developed through an online platform, finalized, and voted on by an international working group of specialists chosen by the Canadian Association of Gastroenterology.

- **Results**: Because of increasing failure of therapy, the consensus group strongly recommends that all H. pylori eradication regimens now be given for 14 days. Recommended first-line strategies include concomitant nonbismuth quadruple therapy (proton pump inhibitor [PPI] + amoxicillin + metronidazole + clarithromycin [PAMC]) and traditional bismuth quadruple therapy (PPI + bismuth + metronidazole + tetracycline [PBMT]). PPI triple therapy (PPI + clarithromycin + either amoxicillin or metronidazole) is restricted to areas with known low clarithromycin resistance or high eradication success with these regimens. Recommended rescue therapies include PBMT and levofloxacin-containing therapy (PPI + amoxicillin + levofloxacin). Rifabutin regimens should be restricted to patients who have failed to respond to at least three prior options.

- **Conclusions**: Optimal treatment of H. pylori infection requires careful attention to local factors.

### Empirical tailored therapy based on genotypic resistance detection for eradication: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111md7sq]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Helicobacter pylori is a major pathogenic factor of gastritis, peptic ulcer, and gastric adenocarcinoma. Compared to other infectious diseases, the eradication success rate for H. pylori remains poor. Common reasons for treatment failure include antibiotic resistance, rapid drug metabolism, poor compliance, and insufficient treatment duration. A previous systematic review and meta-analysis assessing the distribution of H. pylori resistance to commonly used antibiotics found that primary resistance rates to clarithromycin and levofloxacin were more than 15% in most regions. The eradication rate of empirical therapy has declined dramatically due to increasing antibiotic resistance.

In areas with high rates of clarithromycin resistance, bismuth quadruple therapy (BQT) has been recommended as a first-line empiric treatment. High-dose dual therapy (HDDT) also offers an effective regimen with less use of antibiotics for H. pylori infection. Both regimens are recommended to be used for primary and secondary eradication of H. pylori in China.

However, there are still some patients who fail to eradicate H. pylori twice or more and are considered refractory H. pylori infections. With the increase in antibiotic resistance, individualized treatment has attracted great attention in recent years. As stated in the Maastricht VI/Florence Consensus Report, it is reasonable to recommend that susceptibility tests are routinely performed in terms of antibiotic stewardship, even before prescribing first-line treatment. If available, clarithromycin susceptibility testing should be conducted.

### Kyoto global consensus report on Helicobacter pylori gastritis [^11544HUP]. Gut (2015). Low credibility.

Based on the Rome III consensus, functional dyspepsia (FD) is defined as "the presence of chronic dyspeptic symptoms (postprandial fullness, early satiation, epigastric pain, or burning) without evidence of structural disease (including at upper endoscopy) that is likely to explain the symptoms". This group was contrasted with those in whom chronic dyspeptic symptoms have an identified organic or metabolic cause, where elimination of that cause or improvement of the disease leads to resolution or improvement of symptoms.

- **Diagnostic algorithm of Helicobacter pylori-associated dyspepsia**: Patients with dyspeptic symptoms after negative routine laboratory and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, except for positive H. pylori tests, should undergo eradication therapy. If sustained symptomatic relief is obtained, their dyspeptic symptoms are considered as H. pylori-associated dyspepsia. On the other hand, if dyspeptic symptoms do not resolve or recur after eradication therapy, they are judged to have functional dyspepsia. EGD, oesophagogastroduodenoscopy.

The Rome III consensus mentions a subset of patients with H. pylori gastritis as representative of organic dyspepsia if they respond to eradication. Patients with H. pylori gastritis whose symptoms persist despite eradication therapy eliminating the infection were identified as having FD. As mentioned above, eradication therapy studies showed that a subset of H. pylori-infected patients with FD derive symptomatic benefit from eradication, with a delay of at least 6 months from the cure of the infection.

### Rescue therapy for refractory infection: current status and future concepts [^116iaqk3]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2023). Low credibility.

Helicobacter pylori infection is an important issue worldwide, and several guidelines have been published for clinicians to achieve successful eradication. However, there are still some patients who remain infected with H. pylori after treatment. Clinicians should identify the reasons that caused treatment failure and find strategies to manage them.

We have searched and organized the literature and developed methods to overcome factors that contribute to prior treatment failure, such as poor compliance, inadequate intragastric acid suppression, and antibiotic resistance.

- **Compliance improvement**: Telemedicine or smartphone applications might play a role in the modern world by increasing doctor–patient relationships, while concomitant probiotics could be administered to reduce adverse effects and enhance adherence.

- **Better acid suppression**: High-potency and high-dose proton-pump inhibitors or potassium-competitive acid blockers have preferable efficacy.

- **Overcoming antibiotic resistance**: Susceptibility tests, either by culture or by genotyping, are the most commonly used methods and have been suggested for antibiotic selection before rescue therapy, but empirical therapy according to detailed medical history could be an alternative. Eradication with a longer treatment period (14 days) has a better outcome than shorter periods (7 or 10 days).

Ultimately, clinicians should select antibiotics based on the patient's history of drug allergy, previous antibiotic exposure, local antibiotic resistance, available medications, and cost.

### Reconciliation of recent Helicobacter pylori treatment guidelines in a time of increasing resistance to antibiotics [^115e74Cq]. Gastroenterology (2019). Low credibility.

Increasing resistance to antibiotics worldwide has adverse effects on the effectiveness of standard therapies to eradicate Helicobacter pylori infection. We reviewed guidelines developed by expert groups in Europe, Canada, and the United States for the treatment of H. pylori infection. We compared the recommendations of these guidelines, reconciled them, and addressed the increasing resistance of H. pylori to antibiotic therapy regimens.

The guidelines recommend bismuth quadruple therapy for first-line treatment, replacing clarithromycin-based triple therapy. There is consensus for concomitant 4-drug therapy as an alternative, especially when bismuth is not available. When therapy is unsuccessful, it is likely due to resistance to clarithromycin, levofloxacin, and/or metronidazole; these drugs, if used previously, should be avoided in subsequent eradication attempts. Second-line therapies should be bismuth quadruple therapy or levofloxacin triple therapy, depending on suspected resistance. Rifabutin-based triple and high-dose dual amoxicillin proton pump inhibitor therapy should be reserved for subsequent treatment attempts.

The increasing resistance of H. pylori to antibiotic therapy necessitates local availability of susceptibility tests for individuals and the establishment of regional and national monitoring programs to develop evidence-based, locally relevant eradication strategies. Further studies into the development of more easily accessible methods of resistance testing, such as biomarker analysis of stool samples, are required. Options under investigation include substituting von.

Regarding medical management for Helicobacter pylori infection, specifically in terms of first-line regimens, the CAG 2016 guidelines recommend not using the following regimens as first-line therapy in patients with H. pylori infection:

- **Sequential non-bismuth quadruple therapy**: PPI and amoxicillin followed by PPI, metronidazole, and clarithromycin.

- **Levofloxacin triple therapy**: PPI, amoxicillin, and clarithromycin.

### Comparative effectiveness and tolerance of treatments for Helicobacter pylori: Systematic review and network meta-analysis [^113WRKai]. BMJ (2015). Low credibility.

- **Methods**

- **Data sources and searches**: On 20 December 2013, we searched the Cochrane Library, PubMed, and Embase using pre-established search terms that consisted of three parts: strategies for eradication treatment, H. pylori, and a specific filter for randomized controlled trials. We used keywords in combination with both MeSH terms and text words. The search terms included (Helicobacter pylori OR Helicobacter OR Helicobacter infection OR Helicobacter* OR pylori OR Helicobacter pylori [MeSH]) and (eradication OR disease eradication [MeSH] OR treatment OR therapy). We excluded second-line, third-line, rescue, or salvage treatments. There was no limitation on language. To identify eligible studies, we manually checked the reference lists of the included studies.

- **Study selection**: Two researchers (BZL and CZ) initially screened the citation titles and abstracts. The full-text versions of any study of potential relevance were then independently screened in triplicate. Disagreements were resolved through discussions. If discrepancies still existed, we sought the opinions of another two researchers for further discussion.

Included studies were full-text reports of randomized controlled trials that compared different treatments for the eradication of H. pylori. The included studies met several criteria: comparisons among the following eradication treatments: standard triple treatment, ranitidine bismuth citrate-based triple treatment, bismuth-based quadruple treatment, concomitant treatment, levofloxacin-based triple treatment, probiotic-supplemented triple treatment, sequential treatment.

### Empirical or susceptibility-guided treatment for infection? A comprehensive review [^1158h1e8]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2020). Low credibility.

Although susceptibility-guided therapy is frequently recommended for Helicobacter pylori infection, the evidence available supporting this strategy is limited. The aim of the present article is to review the advantages and limitations of the susceptibility-guided and empirical strategies to treat this infection.

We performed a bibliographic search to identify studies investigating H. pylori susceptibility-guided therapy. Culture is not the only way to assess antibiotic resistance, as different polymerase chain reaction-based approaches have been developed as alternative methods. For detecting H. pylori antimicrobial resistance, a molecular approach based on a stool sample might enable more convenient, time-saving methods. Unfortunately, the antimicrobial susceptibility cannot be obtained in all cases.

Furthermore, antibiotic susceptibility testing in clinical practice yields useful information only for a few antibiotics: clarithromycin, metronidazole, and quinolones. Susceptibility towards clarithromycin and metronidazole in vitro does not necessarily lead to eradication in vivo. In the case of H. pylori therapy failure, we should not re-administer any of the antibiotics against which H. pylori has probably become resistant.

Our updated meta-analysis showed that susceptibility-guided treatment is not better than empirical treatment of H. pylori infection in first-line therapy if the most updated quadruple regimens are empirically prescribed. Similar efficacy results were also demonstrated with the two strategies for second-line therapy.

### Helicobacter pylori world Gastroenterology Organization global guideline [^112huKk5]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Helicobacter pylori remains a major health problem worldwide, causing considerable morbidity and mortality due to peptic ulcer disease and gastric cancer. The burden of disease falls disproportionately on less well-resourced populations. As with most infectious diseases, the largest impact on reducing this burden comes from improvement in socioeconomic status, which interrupts transmission. This has been observed in many regions of the world, but the prevalence of infection remains high in many areas where improvements in living standards are slow to occur.

Meanwhile, the optimal clinical management and treatment pathways remain unsettled and are evolving with changing antimicrobial resistance patterns. Despite decades of research and clinical practice, major challenges persist. The quest for the most effective, safe, and simple therapy remains the major issue for clinicians. The search for an effective vaccine appears to remain elusive. Clinical guidelines do not infrequently proffer discordant advice. A major challenge for guidelines is relevance across a variety of populations with varying spectrum of disease, antimicrobial resistance rates, and vastly different resources.

As local factors are central to determining the impact and management strategies for H. pylori infection, it is important that pathways are based on the best available local knowledge rather than solely extrapolating from guidelines formulated in other regions, which may be less applicable. To this end, this revision of the World Gastroenterology Organisation (WGO) H. pylori guideline uses a "C

### The second Irish Helicobacter pylori Working Group consensus for the diagnosis and treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection in adult patients in Ireland [^115StApF]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2024). Low credibility.

- **Statement 9**: 14-day clarithromycin-based triple therapy with a high-dose proton pump inhibitor can only be recommended in cases where clarithromycin susceptibility has been confirmed.

	- **Recommendation**: Strong; quality of evidence: moderate.

Since the publication of the IHPWG guidelines in 2017, clarithromycin-resistant H. pylori has been listed on the WHO priority list of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. A 2018 meta-analysis of 178 studies from 65 countries involving over 66,000 H. pylori isolates revealed that primary resistance to clarithromycin is now over 15% in all WHO regions except the Americas and Southeast Asia. This same study demonstrated that clarithromycin resistance is significantly associated with the failure of clarithromycin-containing regimens. Subsequent pan-European resistance studies have also reported high average primary clarithromycin resistance rates ranging from 21.3% to 25.0%. Our recent data indicates that primary clarithromycin resistance in Ireland is greater than 25%. Cumulative data acquired at both the individual patient level and from population-based analyses have linked previous exposure to macrolides with clarithromycin resistance in H. pylori.

### Worldwide and regional efficacy estimates of first-line Helicobacter pylori treatments: A systematic review and network meta-analysis [^113CTA1D]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2022). Low credibility.

Eradication of Helicobacter pylori infection is challenging. We aimed to determine the optimal first-line H. pylori treatments at global and regional levels.

- **Methods**: We searched Embase, PubMed, Cochrane CENTRAL, Web of Science, Scopus, WHO ICTRP, ClinicalTrials.gov, and ISRCTN registry for randomized controlled trials published during 2011–2020. Utilizing a network meta-analysis in a Bayesian framework, success rates of 23 regimens were compared. The effect size was standardized risk ratio (RR) with a 95% credible interval (CrI). Pooled eradication rate (ER) with 95% CrI was also reported for top combinations. The reference regimen was 7-day clarithromycin-based triple therapy.

- **Results**: This review identified 121 trials comprising 34,759 participants. Globally, 14-day levofloxacin-based sequential therapy was the most efficient (RR: 1.43; 95% CrI, 1.26–1.59) with low certainty of evidence, followed by modified bismuth-containing quadruple therapy (proton pump inhibitor+bismuth compounds+clarithromycin+amoxicillin) for 10 days (RR: 1.35; 95% CrI, 1.22–1.48) and 14 days (RR: 1.27; 95% CrI, 1.12–1.42), and 14-day hybrid therapy (RR: 1.27; 95% CrI, 1.19–1.36). The corresponding ERs were 98.7% (95% CrI, 86.9–100.0), 93.2% (95% CrI, 84.2–100.0), 87.6% (95% CrI, 82.1–93.8), and 87.6% (95% CrI, 77.3–98.0), respectively. Continentally, the most effective combinations were: 10-day clarithromycin-based sequential therapy [RR: 1.21; 95% CrI, 1.02–1.42; ER: 89.5%, 95% CrI, 75.5–100.0] for Africa, and 14-day levofloxacin-based sequential therapy [RR: 1.41; 95% CrI, 1.27–1.5].

### Clopidogrel versus aspirin and esomeprazole to prevent recurrent ulcer bleeding [^111Su8Bx]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2005). High credibility.

Therapy with a proton-pump inhibitor is a standard treatment for patients receiving aspirin who are at risk for ulcers. U.S. guidelines also recommend clopidogrel for patients who have major gastrointestinal intolerance of aspirin. We compared clopidogrel with aspirin plus esomeprazole for the prevention of rebleeding from ulcers in high-risk patients.

- **Methods**: We studied patients who took aspirin to prevent vascular diseases and who presented with ulcer bleeding. After the ulcers had healed, we randomly assigned patients who were negative for Helicobacter pylori to receive either 75 mg of clopidogrel daily plus esomeprazole placebo twice daily or 80 mg of aspirin daily plus 20 mg of esomeprazole twice daily for 12 months. The endpoint was reulcer bleeding.

- **Results**: We enrolled 320 patients (161 patients assigned to receive clopidogrel and 159 to receive aspirin plus esomeprazole). Reulcer bleeding occurred in 13 patients receiving clopidogrel and 1 receiving aspirin plus esomeprazole. The cumulative incidence of rebleeding during the 12-month period was 8.6 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 4.1 to 13.1 percent) among patients who received clopidogrel and 0.7 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 0 to 2.0 percent) among those who received aspirin plus esomeprazole (difference, 7.9 percentage points; 95 percent confidence interval for the difference, 3.4 to 12.4; P = 0.001).

- **Conclusions**: Among patients with a history of aspirin-induced ulcer bleeding whose ulcers had healed before they received the study treatment, aspirin plus esomeprazole was more effective in reducing the risk of rebleeding compared to clopidogrel.

### Efficacy and safety of modified dual therapy as the first-line regimen for the treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection: A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^113LZ16e]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is highly adapted for the colonization of the human stomach and has infected nearly half of the world's population, including approximately 700 million individuals in China. H. pylori infection plays an important role in upper digestive diseases, such as gastritis, peptic ulcers, mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma, and deadly gastric adenocarcinoma. Successful eradication of H. pylori could markedly improve the patient's symptoms, attenuate the course of these diseases, and prevent gastric cancer.

Traditional triple therapy consisting of clarithromycin, amoxicillin (or metronidazole), and a proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) has been used worldwide as the first-line regimen to eradicate H. pylori for decades, achieving eradication rates of over 90% in the 1990s. However, due to increasing resistance to antibiotics, especially clarithromycin, metronidazole, and levofloxacin, the success of clarithromycin triple therapy, as well as several alternative regimens, has rapidly declined. The Toronto Consensus has opposed the use of sequential and hybrid therapies and did not recommend levofloxacin therapy as first-line therapies. At present, the Maastricht V/Florence Consensus, Toronto Consensus, and American College of Gastroenterology Clinical Guideline still recommend clarithromycin triple therapy as one of the first-line regimens, limited to areas where clarithromycin resistance is less than 15%. For areas of high clarithromycin resistance, bismuth quadruple therapy and concomitant therapy (when bismuth is not available, such as in Taiwan) are favored. In China, resistance rates of…

### Sequential and concomitant therapy with four drugs is equally effective for eradication of H pylori infection [^1136AzoT]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2010). Low credibility.

Aims - **Study aims**: Sequential therapy with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) and amoxicillin followed by a PPI, clarithromycin, and an imidazole agent reportedly has a better rate of curing Helicobacter pylori infection than PPI, amoxicillin, and clarithromycin triple therapy. The concomitant administration of these four drugs (concomitant therapy) is also an effective treatment strategy. We compared the efficacies of sequential and concomitant therapy and analyzed the effects of antibiotic resistance in patients with H pylori infection.

Methods - **Methodology**: In a randomized trial of 232 H pylori-infected patients from three hospitals in Kaohsiung, Taiwan, patients were given 10 days of sequential (n = 115) or concomitant (n = 117) therapy. H pylori status was confirmed by endoscopy or urea breath test.

Results - **Study findings**: Intention-to-treat analysis demonstrated similar eradication rates for sequential (92.3%; 95% confidence interval, 87.5%-97.1%) and concomitant therapy (93.0%; 95% CI, 88.3%-97.7%) (P = 0.83). Per-protocol eradication results were similar for sequential (93.1%; 95% CI, 90.7%-95.5%) and concomitant therapy (93.0%; 95% CI, 88.3%-97.7%) (P = 0.99). Univariate analysis showed that compliance and resistance to clarithromycin were independent determinants of eradication. Dual resistance did not influence the level of eradication in the concomitant group, but significantly affected that of the sequential therapy group. Clarithromycin resistance was less frequent than expected.

Conclusions - **Conclusion**: Sequential or concomitant therapy with a PPI, amoxicillin, clarithromycin, and an imidazole agent are.

### American College of Gastroenterology guideline on the management of Helicobacter pylori infection [^1163U1jf]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2007). Low credibility.

Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) remains a prevalent, worldwide, chronic infection. Although the prevalence of this infection appears to be decreasing in many parts of the world, H. pylori is still an important factor linked to the development of peptic ulcer disease, gastric malignancy, and dyspeptic symptoms. The decision to test for H. pylori in patients with functional dyspepsia, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), those taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, with iron deficiency anemia, or those at higher risk of developing gastric cancer remains controversial.

H. pylori can be diagnosed by endoscopic or nonendoscopic methods. A variety of factors, including the need for endoscopy, pretest probability of infection, local availability, and an understanding of the performance characteristics and cost of the individual tests, influence the choice of evaluation in a given patient. Testing to prove eradication should be performed in patients who receive treatment for H. pylori for peptic ulcer disease, individuals with persistent dyspeptic symptoms despite the test-and-treat strategy, those with H. pylori-associated MALT lymphoma, and individuals who have undergone resection of early gastric cancer.

Recent studies suggest that eradication rates achieved by first-line treatment with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), clarithromycin, and amoxicillin have decreased to 70–85%, partly due to increasing clarithromycin resistance. Eradication rates may also be lower with 7-day regimens compared to 14-day regimens. Bismuth-containing quadruple regimens for 7–14 days are another first-line treatment option.

### Helicobacter pylori [^114X2AZe]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

This review focuses on new treatment options for eradicating Helicobacter pylori that have emerged due to decreased efficacy of standard triple therapy as a result of increasing antibiotic resistance. It also reports on new data regarding primary and secondary gastric cancer prevention strategies and the potential role of H. pylori as a risk factor for extragastric malignancies.

- **Recent findings**: Treatment options have shifted from triple to various quadruple modifications. The length of therapy duration has been extended generally from 7 to 10 and 14 days. Nonbismuth-based quadruple therapies, prescribed as sequential, concomitant, and hybrid, have shown superiority compared to standard triple therapy in eradicating clarithromycin-resistant H. pylori. Bismuth-based quadruple therapy appears almost totally independent of antibiotic resistance and maintains high eradication rates. Levofloxacin is an adequate substitute for clarithromycin and is recommended in second-line regimens. However, it should be used prudently as H. pylori has developed resistance to levofloxacin in many regions of the world. Strategies for primary gastric cancer prevention by H. pylori eradication are effective, whereas eradication for secondary gastric cancer prevention is uncertain. Recent data implicate H. pylori as a risk factor for extragastric malignancies.

- **Summary**: H. pylori therapy should be tailored according to local antibiotic resistance patterns. In many regions of the world, H. pylori is becoming increasingly resistant to clarithromycin.

### Lansoprazole for the prevention of recurrences of ulcer complications from long-term low-dose aspirin use [^115uR65D]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

The role of gastric acid suppression in preventing the recurrence of ulcer complications after the eradication of Helicobacter pylori infection in patients taking long-term low-dose aspirin is uncertain.

- **Methods**: We enrolled 123 patients who had ulcer complications after using low-dose aspirin continuously for more than one month and who had H. pylori infection. After the ulcers healed and the H. pylori infection was eradicated, the patients were randomly assigned to treatment with 30 mg of lansoprazole daily or placebo, in addition to 100 mg of aspirin daily, for 12 months. The primary endpoint was the recurrence of ulcer complications.

- **Results**: During a median follow-up of 12 months, 9 of the 61 patients in the placebo group (14.8 percent), as compared with 1 of the 62 patients in the lansoprazole group (1.6 percent), had a recurrence of ulcer complications (adjusted hazard ratio, 9.6; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.2 to 76.1). Of these 10 patients, 4 had evidence of a recurrence of H. pylori infection and 2 had taken nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs before the onset of complications. Patients in the lansoprazole group were significantly less likely to have a recurrence of ulcer complications than those in the placebo group (P = 0.008). There was no significant difference in mortality between the two groups.

- **Conclusions**: In patients who had ulcer complications related to the long-term use of low-dose aspirin, treatment with lansoprazole in addition to the eradication of H. pylori infection significantly reduced the rate of recurrence of ulcer complications.

### H. pylori eradication therapy vs. antisecretory non-eradication therapy (with or without long-term maintenance antisecretory therapy) for the prevention of recurrent bleeding from peptic ulcer [^114ajWYN]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Peptic ulcer is the main cause of upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage, and Helicobacter pylori infection is the primary etiologic factor for peptic ulcer disease. Maintenance antisecretory therapy has been the standard long-term treatment for patients with bleeding ulcers to prevent rebleeding. However, the precise efficacy of H. pylori eradication for the prevention of rebleeding from peptic ulcers remains unknown.

- **Objectives**: To compare the efficacy of H. pylori eradication therapy versus antisecretory non-eradication therapy (with or without long-term maintenance antisecretory therapy) for the prevention of rebleeding from peptic ulcers.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (The Cochrane Library, Issue 1, 2003), MEDLINE (January 1966 to March 2003), EMBASE (January 1988 to March 2003), CINAHL (January 1982 to March 2003), and reference lists of articles. Additionally, a manual search was conducted at several congresses.

- **Selection criteria**: Controlled clinical trials comparing the efficacy of H. pylori eradication therapy versus antisecretory non-eradication therapy (with or without long-term maintenance antisecretory therapy) for the prevention of rebleeding from peptic ulcers.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two reviewers performed the extraction and quality assessment of studies. Study authors were contacted for additional information.

- **Main results**: Six studies with a total of 355 patients were included in the first meta-analysis. The mean percentage of rebleeding in the H. pylori eradication therapy group was 4.5%.

### Clopidogrel with or without omeprazole in coronary artery disease [^116sx8jh]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Gastrointestinal complications are an important problem of antithrombotic therapy. Proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) are believed to decrease the risk of such complications, though no randomized trial has proved this in patients receiving dual antiplatelet therapy. Recently, concerns have been raised about the potential for PPIs to blunt the efficacy of clopidogrel.

- **Methods**: We randomly assigned patients with an indication for dual antiplatelet therapy to receive clopidogrel in combination with either omeprazole or placebo, in addition to aspirin. The primary gastrointestinal endpoint was a composite of overt or occult bleeding, symptomatic gastroduodenal ulcers or erosions, obstruction, or perforation. The primary cardiovascular endpoint was a composite of death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, revascularization, or stroke. The trial was terminated prematurely when the sponsor lost financing.

- **Results**: We planned to enroll about 5,000 patients; a total of 3,873 were randomly assigned, and 3,761 were included in analyses. In all, 51 patients had a gastrointestinal event; the event rate was 1.1% with omeprazole and 2.9% with placebo at 180 days (hazard ratio with omeprazole, 0.34; 95% confidence interval, 0.18 to 0.63; P < 0.001). The rate of overt upper gastrointestinal bleeding was also reduced with omeprazole compared with placebo (hazard ratio, 0.13; 95% CI, 0.03 to 0.56; P = 0.001). A total of 109 patients had a cardiovascular event, with event rates of 4.9% with omeprazole and 5.7% with placebo (hazard ratio with omeprazole, 0.99).

### The potential interaction between clopidogrel and proton pump inhibitors: A systematic review [^111RdMg2]. BMC Medicine (2010). High credibility.

This systematic review examines the potential interaction between clopidogrel, a common antiplatelet medication, and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), which are frequently prescribed to reduce stomach acid. The inquiry into this interaction is crucial as both medications are commonly used together to manage cardiovascular risks without causing gastrointestinal complications.

- **Background and rationale**: Clopidogrel and PPIs' interaction is significant given their widespread use in the population at risk for cardiovascular diseases. Understanding this potential interaction can guide more effective prescribing practices.

- **Methodology**: The study utilized a systematic approach to abstract relevant data independently. Statistical analyses were performed to assess the interaction between the medications.

- **Contributions**: The project was conceived by JMB. Both JMB and JPAL collaborated in developing the protocol and were responsible for independently abstracting the data. JMB conducted the statistical analysis, and both JMB and JPAL co-authored all drafts and the final manuscript.

The systematic review ultimately aims to contribute to informed clinical decisions regarding the concurrent use of clopidogrel and proton pump inhibitors for patients requiring both treatments.

### Empirical or susceptibility-guided treatment for infection? A comprehensive review [^111QknEd]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2020). Low credibility.

Although susceptibility-guided therapy is frequently recommended for Helicobacter pylori infection, the evidence supporting this strategy is limited at the time of writing. This article aims to review the advantages and limitations of both susceptibility-guided and empirical strategies to treat this infection. We performed a bibliographic search to identify studies investigating H. pylori susceptibility-guided therapy.

Culture is not the only method to assess antibiotic resistance, as different polymerase chain reaction-based approaches have been developed as alternatives. A molecular approach based on a stool sample might enable more convenient, time-saving methods for detecting H. pylori antimicrobial resistance. Unfortunately, antimicrobial susceptibility cannot be obtained in all cases.

Additionally, susceptibility to clarithromycin and metronidazole in vitro does not necessarily lead to eradication in vivo.

In the case of H. pylori therapy failure, we should not re-administer any antibiotics against which H. pylori has probably become resistant. Our updated meta-analysis showed that susceptibility-guided treatment is not better than empirical treatment of H. pylori infection in first-line therapy if the most updated quadruple regimens are empirically prescribed. Similar efficacy results were also demonstrated with the two strategies for second-line therapy.

### ACG clinical guideline: Treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection [^115XaEn9]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). High credibility.

Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection is a common worldwide infection and an important cause of peptic ulcer disease and gastric cancer. H. pylori may also play a role in uninvestigated and functional dyspepsia, ulcer risk in patients taking low-dose aspirin, or those starting therapy with a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication, unexplained iron deficiency anemia, and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura.

When choosing a treatment regimen for H. pylori, it is essential to ask patients about previous antibiotic exposure and incorporate this information into the decision-making process.

- **First-line treatment**:
	- Clarithromycin triple therapy should be limited to patients with no previous history of macrolide exposure who reside in areas where clarithromycin resistance among H. pylori isolates is low.
	- Most patients will benefit more from bismuth quadruple therapy or concomitant therapy consisting of a PPI, clarithromycin, amoxicillin, and metronidazole.

- **Salvage regimen**:
	- If first-line therapy fails, a salvage regimen should avoid antibiotics that were used previously.
	- If a patient received a first-line treatment containing clarithromycin, bismuth quadruple therapy, or levofloxacin salvage regimens are the preferred options.
	- If a patient received first-line bismuth quadruple therapy, clarithromycin or levofloxacin-containing salvage regimens are preferred.

Details regarding the drugs, doses, and durations of the recommended and suggested first-line and salvage regimens can be found in the guideline.

Regarding medical management for Helicobacter pylori infection, specifically concerning treatment failure and choice of regimen, the CAG 2016 guidelines recommend considering levofloxacin-containing therapy. This therapy consists of a PPI, levofloxacin, and amoxicillin for 14 days and is an option for patients who have failed to respond to H. pylori eradication therapy.

### Second-line rescue therapy of helicobacter pylori infection [^115QYXQw]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2009). Low credibility.

Helicobacter pylori infection is the main known cause of gastritis, gastroduodenal ulcer disease, and gastric cancer. After more than 20 years of experience in H. pylori treatment, the ideal regimen to treat this infection has yet to be found. In contemporary practice, beyond knowing first-line eradication regimens well, we must be prepared to address treatment failures. Therefore, in designing a treatment strategy, we should focus not only on the results of primary therapy but also on the final (overall) eradication rate.

- **Rescue treatment strategy**: The choice of a 'rescue' treatment depends on the initial treatment used. If a first-line clarithromycin-based regimen was used, a second-line metronidazole-based treatment (quadruple therapy) may follow, with a levofloxacin-based combination as a third-line 'rescue' option. Alternatively, levofloxacin-based 'rescue' therapy is an encouraging second-line strategy, representing an alternative to quadruple therapy in patients with previous PPI-clarithromycin-amoxicillin failure, due to its efficacy, simplicity, and safety. In such cases, the quadruple regimen may be reserved as a third-line 'rescue' option.

- **Advanced strategies**: Rifabutin-based 'rescue' therapy is an encouraging empirical fourth-line strategy after multiple eradication failures with key antibiotics, such as amoxicillin, clarithromycin, metronidazole, tetracycline, and levofloxacin.

Even after two consecutive failures, several studies have demonstrated that H. pylori eradication can finally be achieved.

### The potential interaction between clopidogrel and proton pump inhibitors: a systematic review [^112ygBig]. BMC Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

The quality score of unpublished studies was systematically reduced by one grade due to the absence of formal peer review. Isolated abstracts were considered to be of low quality as there are insufficient details to fully evaluate these reports. Whenever possible, an external quality measure that compared survival curves from the clopidogrel efficacy randomized trials to the observational hazard ratios was performed to check for consistency in the etiologically relevant time windows.

Since study heterogeneity existed concerning research methods, quality, study populations, and health care systems, it was decided a priori that quantitative data pooling was inappropriate.

Regarding the medical management of Helicobacter pylori infection, particularly in the context of treatment failure, the CAG 2016 guidelines recommend administering bismuth quadruple therapy. This therapy consists of a PPI, bismuth, metronidazole, and tetracycline for 14 days and is suggested as an option for patients who have failed to respond to clarithromycin-containing H. pylori eradication therapy.

### AGA clinical practice update on the management of refractory Helicobacter pylori infection: Expert review [^117BMfs9]. Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Failure to eradicate H. pylori results from the complex interaction of host-, microbial-, and systems-related factors. Antibiotic resistance (microbial and systems) and patient nonadherence (host and systems) are the two most commonly cited reasons for eradication failure. However, because primary eradication failure still occurs despite confirmed antibiotic sensitivity and patient adherence, potentially with higher frequency in refractory H. pylori specifically, additional factors are likely also relevant.

Providers should attempt to identify all contributing etiologies before simply prescribing alternative antibiotics. These factors, along with antibiotic resistance and nonadherence, are described herein.

### AGA clinical practice update on the management of refractory Helicobacter pylori infection: Expert review [^1124Jqta]. Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of Helicobacter pylori infection, particularly concerning treatment failure and choice of regimen, the AGA 2021 guidelines recommend considering the use of amoxicillin, tetracycline, and rifabutin for subsequent therapies in patients with refractory H. pylori infection, as resistance to these agents is rare.

### Treatment of Helicobacter pylori [^113ib2dw]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2001). Low credibility.

Helicobacter pylori causes several gastroduodenal diseases. Various antibiotic regimens are available that eradicate H. pylori in 80 to 90% of patients, but no regimen cures all patients. Dual therapy is now obsolete. Triple therapy, with two antibiotics and either a proton pump inhibitor or bismuth, is the regimen of choice. Metronidazole and clarithromycin are the two key antibiotics. Antibiotic resistance against these two drugs is becoming more problematic and should be taken into consideration when choosing a regimen, as antibiotic resistance is usually induced after failure.

Quadruple therapy has been used as a salvage regimen in failed cases, but it is also the most complicated regimen. Several new agents are being studied, including a single capsule that contains bismuth, metronidazole, and tetracycline.

### Hellenic consensus on infection [^11423uDp]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2020). Low credibility.

H. pylori eradication is highly advisable in NSAID or aspirin users with a history of peptic ulcer disease and upper gastrointestinal bleeding. In a randomized trial, it was shown that H. pylori eradication significantly reduces the rates of ulcer re-bleeding in users of aspirin or, to a lesser degree, NSAIDs who have a history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding, as opposed to therapy with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) alone.

Eradication of H. pylori was equivalent to maintenance treatment with PPIs in preventing re-bleeding in those taking low-dose aspirin, while PPIs were superior in those taking other NSAIDs. H. pylori eradication reduced but did not eliminate the risk of re-bleeding in high-risk patients taking low-dose aspirin. Therefore, in NSAID or aspirin users, after an episode of complicated or uncomplicated peptic ulcer, prophylactic therapy with PPI is mandatory in addition to H. pylori eradication. This strategy has also been shown to be the most cost-effective, according to a mathematical model.

### AGA clinical practice update on the management of refractory Helicobacter pylori infection: Expert review [^116H3rrn]. Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

An algorithm for regimen considerations in refractory H. pylori cases is illustrated in Figure 2. This algorithm is based on the initial therapy used and the presence or absence of a true penicillin allergy. Of these regimens, only PBMT is FDA-approved for refractory H. pylori infection. If bismuth-based quadruple therapy failed as a first-line treatment, shared decision-making between providers and patients should guide the selection between:

- **Levofloxacin or rifabutin-based triple therapy regimens**: High-dose dual proton pump inhibitor (PPI) and amoxicillin.
- **Alternative bismuth-containing quadruple therapy**: As second-line options.

Due to rising rates of levofloxacin resistance, levofloxacin should not be considered for treatment unless the H. pylori strain is known to be sensitive to it, or if the population levofloxacin resistance rates are known to be less than 15% (analogous to the longstanding "rule" regarding clarithromycin usage in triple therapies). However, it is reasonable to consider rifabutin in a triple regimen without prior sensitivity testing since rifabutin and amoxicillin resistance are rare. A recent study demonstrated that the addition of rifabutin to the high-dose amoxicillin and PPI dual regimen significantly improves eradication rates. Although the referenced study used this regimen as first-line therapy, based on these data, it is reasonable to consider PAR usage with high-dose and/or high-potency PPI and amoxicillin 750 mg TID over high-dose dual therapy alone.

Optimal dosing of PPIs is provided in Table 1.

### AGA clinical practice update on the management of refractory Helicobacter pylori infection: Expert review [^112fSwVk]. Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

The primary objectives of this clinical practice update (CPU) expert review are to provide a salient overview of determinants of H. pylori eradication treatment failure, including host, microbe, and systems-related factors as they are currently understood. Additionally, the review aims to leverage these data to provide clinical practitioners with evidence- and consensus-based multimodal best practice advice for treating H. pylori after the first treatment failure. We include a clinically relevant synthesis of contemporary data on the appropriateness and efficacy, or lack thereof, of specific antimicrobial treatment regimens and adjunctive therapeutic agents for this purpose. The terms "salvage" and "rescue" therapy are commonly used in the literature to describe treatment courses following the initial eradication therapy, but without a consistent definition. As such, we avoid the use of these terms. Additionally, to the extent possible, we focus on evidence from North America to ensure that this article is most relevant for US practitioners.

For the purpose of this CPU expert review, refractory H. pylori infection is defined by a persistently positive non-serological H. pylori test (i.e. a breath-, stool-, or gastroscopy-based test), at least 4 weeks following one or more completed course(s) of guideline-recommended first-line H. pylori eradication therapy, and while off any medications that might impact the test sensitivity, such as proton-pump inhibitors (PPI). Refractory H. pylori infection should be differentiated from reinfection.

### Kyoto global consensus report on Helicobacter pylori gastritis [^115YAUbr]. Gut (2015). Low credibility.

H. pylori is a major human pathogen that causes chronic and progressive gastric mucosal damage and is etiologically related to peptic ulcer, gastric cancer, and gastric atrophy. It is also closely associated with gastric MALT lymphoma, dyspepsia, hyperplastic gastric polyps, and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura. H. pylori-positive individuals are also the major reservoir for the transmission of the infection.

The decision to eradicate a chronic infection in a society should be based on quantitative data regarding the outcome of untreated infections. H. pylori causes a chronic infection similar, for example, to asymptomatic syphilis or tuberculosis, and the final outcome for any individual cannot be predicted. H. pylori infection differs from many other chronic infectious diseases because it is always transmissible, thus putting others at risk. Because the gastric damage is progressive, the lack of an obvious clinical manifestation at diagnosis has no predictive value for lifetime risk to an individual patient, their family, or the community.

Benefits of H. pylori eradication for an individual depend in part on the degree and extent of damage that has already occurred and the reversibility of that damage. Potential benefits of eradication include stopping the progression of mucosal damage, stabilization or reduction in risk of developing gastric cancer, resolution of mucosal inflammation, stabilization or improvement of gastric mucosal function, return to the normal mechanisms governing acid secretion, and cure of H. pylori-related peptic ulcer disease (PUD), as well as reduction in risk of gastroenterological complications.

### AGA clinical practice update on the management of refractory Helicobacter pylori infection: Expert review [^112fq9qC]. Gastroenterology (2021). Low credibility.

The most effective strategy for managing refractory H. pylori is preventing refractory H. pylori infection by improving success rates of primary eradication therapy.

Personalizing the initial H. pylori eradication therapy by incorporating individual host genetic, host non-genetic, and microbial factors might help achieve this by shifting the paradigm away from empiric therapy alone. Population-specific research, with particular attention to race, ethnic, and age groups, can indicate determinants that impact eradication success in the US. Regional information on local success rates would further refine regimen selection. The Pan-European Registry on H. pylori management is one prototype to emulate. Ideally, such a model would encompass systematic collection and reporting, together with periodic updates of regimen-specific local eradication rates — including regimens for primary and refractory infection — along with relevant nonidentifiable individual-level data such as demographics, smoking history, prior antibiotic exposure, and antibiotic sensitivity data if available. Aggregated data should be made publicly available to guide local selection of H. pylori eradication therapy. This information could be utilized for both initial and refractory treatment choices.

Non-invasive H. pylori antibiotic sensitivity testing on stool, to supplant sensitivity testing using endoscopically obtained samples, would overcome many rate-limiting barriers precluding widespread uptake of sensitivity testing.

### Best treatment approach: Should a national consensus be the best consensus [^114F7fTP]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

A significant number of national and international consensuses have been published in the literature during recent years concerning the treatment of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori). These guidelines are aimed toward achieving an extremely high cure rate (≥ 90%), which seems to be unachievable in real-world settings, especially in areas with high clarithromycin resistance, such as southern Europe. Times change quickly and, as with other infectious diseases, we are moving inevitably from a trial-and-error therapeutic approach to a susceptibility-based one. Empirical first-line treatments should be based on what works best in each geographical and/or national area and must take into account the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance in each region.

We have reviewed the basic conclusive suggestions from the existing guidelines and consensuses worldwide concerning the best anti-H. pylori treatment approach in relation to antibiotic resistance. According to this global plethora of recommendations, it is worth remembering that the determinants of a successful H. pylori eradication could be divided into host-related factors (e.g. previous antibiotic exposure, patient's adherence to a multi-drug regimen, and/or genetic factors) and H. pylori-related factors, with antibiotic sensitivity appearing to be the most important and consistent predictor of success, both in clinical trials and in population-based studies of H. pylori eradication. Thus, it is of major importance for a country's clinical practitioners to know the local pattern of resistance.

### Optimum duration of regimens for Helicobacter pylori eradication [^116VE7dV]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). High credibility.

The optimal duration for Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) eradication therapy is controversial, with recommendations ranging from 7 to 14 days. Several systematic reviews have attempted to address this issue but have presented conflicting results and limited their analysis to proton pump inhibitor (PPI) and two antibiotics (PPI triple) therapy. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the optimal duration of multiple H. pylori eradication regimens.

- **Objectives**: The primary objective was to assess the relative effectiveness of different durations (7, 10, or 14 days) of a variety of regimens for eradicating H. pylori. The primary outcome was H. pylori persistence. The secondary outcome was adverse events.

- **Search methods**: The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL were searched up to December 2011 to identify eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs). We also searched the proceedings of six conferences from 1995 to 2011, dissertations and theses, and grey literature. There were no language restrictions applied to any search.

- **Selection criteria**: Only parallel group RCTs assessing the efficacy of one to two weeks' duration of first-line H. pylori eradication regimens in adults were eligible. Within each regimen, the same combinations of drugs at the same dose were compared over different durations. Studies with at least two arms comparing 7, 10, or 14 days were included. Enrolled participants needed to be diagnosed with at least one positive test for H. pylori based on a rapid urease test (RUT), histology, culture, or urea breath test.

### Clopidogrel with proton pump inhibitors: Safe or not [^111ZUvuE]. Clinical Cardiology (2011). Low credibility.

Gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding is a serious complication associated with the use of antiplatelet therapy, and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are known to be beneficial in decreasing such risk. Several studies in the recent past have suggested concerns regarding the interaction between clopidogrel and PPIs, presumably due to the inhibition of clopidogrel activity and thus the attenuation of its antiplatelet activity.

A web-based literature and guidelines search was conducted using the keywords "clopidogrel", "omeprazole", "proton pump inhibitors", and "interaction". Relevant studies (n = 11) from the search results were systematically reviewed and summarized. The studies were categorized based on their retrospective or prospective nature. Most of the retrospective, observational studies suggested a link between the two; however, recent prospective studies have shown no interaction and a positive influence of PPIs in preventing the GI side effects of antiplatelet therapy.

There is currently insufficient clinical evidence to suggest an interaction between clopidogrel and PPIs. The decision to add PPI therapy to clopidogrel should be guided by its clinical indications rather than as a routine prophylactic measure.

### Prevention of gastric cancer: When is treatment of Helicobacter pylori warranted [^111FaYK4]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2008). Low credibility.

Chronic gastritis induced by Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is the strongest known risk factor for adenocarcinoma of the distal stomach, yet the effects of bacterial eradication on carcinogenesis remain unclear. H. pylori isolates possess substantial genotypic diversity, which engenders differential host inflammatory responses that influence clinical outcomes. H. pylori strains that possess the cag pathogenicity island and secrete a functional cytotoxin induce more severe gastric injury and further augment the risk for developing distal gastric cancer. Carcinogenesis is also influenced by host genetic diversity, particularly involving immune response genes such as interleukin-1ß and tumor necrosis factor-α. Human trials and animal studies have indicated that eradication of H. pylori prior to the development of atrophic gastritis offers the best chance for prevention of gastric cancer. However, although the timing of intervention influences the magnitude of suppression of premalignant and neoplastic lesions, bacterial eradication, even in longstanding infections, is of clear benefit to the host. It is important to gain insight into the pathogenesis of H. pylori-induced gastritis and adenocarcinoma not only to develop more effective treatments for gastric cancer but also because it might serve as a paradigm for the role of chronic inflammation in the genesis of other malignancies that arise within the gastrointestinal tract.

Regarding medical management for Helicobacter pylori infection, specifically concerning treatment failure and choice of regimen, AGA 2021 guidelines recommend avoiding clarithromycin- or levofloxacin-based regimens when there is a history of any treatment with macrolides or fluoroquinolones, respectively, due to the high likelihood of resistance.

### Update on the diagnosis and management of Helicobacter pylori infection in adults [^115QVTSa]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection is becoming increasingly challenging due largely to the rising rates of antimicrobial resistance and the relative complexity of treatment regimens. If a reliable test to assess the antimicrobial sensitivity/resistance of H. pylori was readily available, treatment would be more focused and — presumably — more effective. However, antimicrobial sensitivity testing is difficult to obtain in most parts of the United States, so physicians must rely on clinical judgment when selecting treatment regimens for their infected patients. The aims of this review are to summarize recent treatment recommendations and examine available evidence on how we might improve our treatment selections. This review is directed primarily toward physicians practicing in the United States.
