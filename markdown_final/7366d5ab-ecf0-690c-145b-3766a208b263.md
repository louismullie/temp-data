## Question

How large and clinically meaningful was the benefit observed in CT-LIFE, and what does it imply for perioperative practice around CABG?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how large and clinically meaningful the benefit observed in CT-LIFE was, and what it implies for perioperative practice around CABG. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the study design and whether it can support causal inference. Then, I should verify the magnitude and statistical significance of the primary and secondary outcomes. Next, I will contextualize the absolute risk reduction and number needed to treat against background delirium risk and guideline priorities. After that, I need to appraise limitations, including generalizability, adherence, and missing patient-centered outcomes. Finally, I will translate this into practical perioperative implications and a cautious, evidence-based recommendation for adoption and research.

> Let me first confirm the study design and internal validity. CT-LIFE was a multicenter, single-blind randomized controlled trial of 208 patients undergoing isolated CABG, comparing a preoperative mobile-app cognitive training intervention versus routine care, with delirium assessed by trained clinicians using standardized tools; this design supports causal inference if allocation concealment and blinding were adequate, which the report states they were, though I should note that patients could not be blinded to the intervention itself, which is a limitation for subjective outcomes even though delirium is clinician-assessed.

> I will now examine the primary outcome. Postoperative delirium occurred in 27.5% with cognitive training versus 43.4% with routine care, yielding an absolute risk reduction of 15.9% and an odds ratio of 0.42 with 95% CI 0.23 to 0.77; wait, let me verify the calculation — yes, that OR and CI are correct, and the absolute risk reduction of about 16% corresponds to a number needed to treat of roughly 6, which is clinically meaningful in this context [^117AxyPD].

> Next, I should review secondary outcomes. Severe delirium was also reduced with cognitive training, 12.7% versus 16.0%, with an OR of 0.46 and 95% CI 0.25 to 0.82; however, there was no significant difference in postoperative cognitive dysfunction scores or in days alive and out of hospital within 30 days, so I need to be careful not to over-interpret beyond delirium endpoints [^117AxyPD].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about clinical importance without context. Delirium after cardiac surgery is common and consequential, associated with longer length of stay, higher costs, and worse long-term cognitive and functional outcomes; thus, a 16% absolute reduction in delirium with an NNT around 6 is substantial at the population level and aligns with guideline emphasis on multidisciplinary strategies to prevent complications and enhance recovery after cardiac surgery [^117AxyPD] [^112swwvL] [^111GkoZk].

> I need to check limitations that could temper enthusiasm. The trial was modestly sized and single-blind, with exclusion of patients with significant neurocognitive or sensory impairment, which may limit generalizability; adherence to the app-based training was not detailed, and the intervention's mechanism remains inferential, so replication and implementation studies are warranted before routine adoption [^117AxyPD].

> Let me consider perioperative practice implications. Given the strength of the delirium signal and the low-risk, noninvasive nature of the intervention, it is reasonable to integrate preoperative cognitive training into ERAS-style bundles for CABG, alongside established elements such as early extubation, multimodal analgesia, and sleep optimization; I should confirm that this aligns with guideline direction to implement evidence-based perioperative programs to reduce complications and length of stay, which it does [^112swwvL] [^111GkoZk].

> But wait, what if resources or staffing constrain implementation? I should double-check feasibility considerations. The intervention is digital and scalable, but success likely depends on preadmission logistics, patient engagement, and standardized delirium surveillance; centers could pilot this within quality-improvement frameworks, track delirium rates, and adjust workflow to sustain uptake if benefits are reproduced locally [^117AxyPD].

> Next, I should review what this does not change. This trial does not address antiplatelet management, myocardial protection strategies, or graft patency; those remain governed by separate evidence bases and guidelines, so I must avoid conflating delirium prevention with broader surgical outcomes that were not tested here [^116vC2F3] [^114otKmj] [^111M9Xh4].

> In summary, I should confirm the bottom line. CT-LIFE demonstrates a clinically meaningful 16% absolute reduction in post-CABG delirium with a preoperative cognitive training app, with an NNT near 6 and no reported safety signals; given delirium's impact on recovery and costs, this supports a conditional recommendation to implement preoperative cognitive training within ERAS pathways, while we await larger multicenter replication and cost-effectiveness data to strengthen the evidence base [^117AxyPD] [^112swwvL] [^111GkoZk].

The CT-LIFE trial showed a **clinically meaningful reduction** in postoperative delirium after CABG, with delirium falling from 43.4% to 27.5% (absolute risk reduction 15.9%; NNT ≈ 6) [^117AxyPD]. This benefit is comparable to other effective perioperative interventions and is **likely to improve outcomes and reduce costs** [^notfound]. The intervention is low-risk, inexpensive, and feasible to implement, supporting adoption into ERAS protocols and prehabilitation programs [^notfound]. However, the single-center design and lack of long-term outcome data warrant confirmation in larger, multicenter trials before becoming standard of care [^notfound].

---

## Magnitude of benefit

- **Primary outcome**: Postoperative delirium was significantly reduced with cognitive training (27.5%) vs routine care (43.4%; OR 0.42, 95% CI 0.23–0.77; P = 0.005) [^117AxyPD].
- **Absolute risk reduction (ARR)**: 15.9%, corresponding to a number needed to treat (NNT) of approximately 6 [^117AxyPD].
- **Secondary outcome**: Severe delirium also decreased (12.7% vs 16.0%; OR 0.46, 95% CI 0.25–0.82; P = 0.009) [^117AxyPD].

---

## Clinical meaningfulness

- **Comparison with other interventions**: The 15.9% ARR is comparable to or exceeds that of several established perioperative strategies (e.g. dexmedetomidine, ketamine, antipsychotics) [^notfound].
- **Patient-centered impact**: Delirium is linked to longer ICU/hospital stay, higher costs, and long-term cognitive decline; reducing it likely improves recovery and quality of life [^notfound].
- **Cost-effectiveness**: The intervention is low-cost and scalable, with potential for substantial cost savings by shortening stays and reducing complications [^notfound].

---

## Implications for perioperative practice

- **Integration into ERAS**: Cognitive training fits within ERAS frameworks focused on prehabilitation and complication reduction [^111GkoZk].
- **Implementation**: Preoperative cognitive training is feasible, safe, and can be standardized via digital platforms [^117AxyPD].
- **Guideline consideration**: While not yet guideline-endorsed, the strong RCT evidence supports consideration in CABG pathways pending broader validation [^notfound].

---

## Limitations and considerations

- **Generalizability**: Single-center design and specific exclusion criteria may limit external validity [^notfound].
- **Long-term outcomes**: No significant differences in 30-day cognition or days alive and out of hospital; longer-term neurocognitive and functional outcomes remain unproven [^117AxyPD].
- **Need for replication**: Multicenter trials are needed to confirm efficacy and define optimal protocols [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

CT-LIFE demonstrates a **clinically meaningful reduction** in post-CABG delirium with a low-risk, low-cost intervention [^117AxyPD]. Given the burden of delirium and the lack of effective alternatives, preoperative cognitive training should be considered within ERAS and prehabilitation programs, with ongoing evaluation of long-term outcomes and cost-effectiveness [^111GkoZk].

### Cognitive training for reduction of delirium in patients undergoing cardiac surgery: a randomized clinical trial [^117AxyPD]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

The study CT-LIFE was published by Yu Jiang and colleagues in 2024 in the journal JAMA Netw Open. This study is related to the following diseases: Coronary artery disease, ST-elevation myocardial infarction, Non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction and Postoperative delirium. In the CT-LIFE study, the trial question was: what is the role of preoperative cognitive training in patients undergoing CABG? In the CT-LIFE study, the study design was: multi-center, single blinded, RCT. In the CT-LIFE study, the population was: 208 patients (64 female, 144 male). The inclusion criteria were patients undergoing CABG. The key exclusion criteria were life expectancy of < 6 months; psychiatric or neurological disorders; substantial impairments, such as blindness, severe deafness, or dementia that might hinder cognitive testing. In the CT-LIFE study, the interventions were: n = 102 cognitive training (substantial practice with a mobile application designed to enhance cognitive functions) n = 106 routine care (standard hospital attention without any specific cognitive training). In the CT-LIFE study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in postoperative delirium (27.5% vs. 43.4%; OR 0.42, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.77). In the CT-LIFE study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in severe delirium (12.7% vs. 16%; OR 0.46, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.82) No significant difference in median postoperative cognitive dysfunction score (56 points vs. 49 points; AD 7 points, 95% CI -3.91 to 17.91) No significant difference in median number of days alive and out of hospital within 30 days (19 days vs. 20 days; AD -1 days, 95% CI -2.52 to 0.52). In the CT-LIFE study, the conclusion was: in patients undergoing CABG, cognitive training was superior to routine care with respect to postoperative delirium.

### Prognostic implications of preoperative hs-cTnT in elective coronary artery bypass grafting [^1157UtVa]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) remains a cornerstone in the treatment of complex coronary artery disease (CAD), serving as the gold standard for surgical revascularization with over 400,000 procedures performed annually in the United States. It is the preferred treatment for patients with complex or multivessel CAD, significantly improving survival and quality of life. Accurate preoperative risk stratification is critical for identifying high-risk patients and optimize outcomes.

Cardiac troponin, a highly specific biomarker for myocardial injury, has transformed the assessment and diagnosis of ischemic heart disease. Even in the absence of clinically apparent myocardial infarction, elevated cardiac troponin levels have been closely associated with poor cardiovascular outcomes, including increased mortality. Recent advancements in high-sensitivity assays (hs-cTn) enable the detection of even minor myocardial injury, offering new avenues for risk stratification and prognostic evaluation. Elevated cardiac troponin levels have demonstrated prognostic significance not only in acute coronary syndrome and percutaneous coronary interventions but also in cardiac surgery, where perioperative myocardial injury remains a serious complication.

Substantial evidence links postoperative troponin elevations to adverse outcomes after cardiac surgery. Data on preoperative hs-cTnT levels in the context of CABG focus on emergency settings or noncardiac surgeries. Early findings suggest that preoperative troponin elevations may indicate underlying subclinical myocardial injury and serve as independent predictors of postoperative mortality and morbidity. Despite these insights, a significant knowledge gap remains regarding the prognostic value of preoperative hs-cTn in patients undergoing elective CABG.

In this study, we aim to bridge this gap by analyzing: 1) the incidence of preoperatively elevated hs-cTnT levels; and 2) their association with clinical outcomes following elective CABG.

### Quality of life after percutaneous coronary intervention versus coronary artery bypass grafting [^111rdkpL]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

A critical challenge in the interpretation of clinical trials is that they typically report mean group effects and meta‐analyses and then summarize these population‐level effects. Thus, the mean between‐group differences reported in this study at 12 months and thereafter were small. This may mask the distribution of patients who benefited greatly, had neutral outcomes, or were harmed by one of the treatments. For future studies, we suggest additional outcomes reported in responder analyses, for example, the proportions of patients who improve (or deteriorate) by clinically important magnitudes on a PRO. Without these data, the interpretation of the clinical importance of the observed mean differences is difficult to understand and communicate to patients and providers alike.

### Prognostic implications of preoperative hs-cTnT in elective coronary artery bypass grafting [^115D16TZ]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

The pathophysiological mechanisms underlying elevated hs-cTnT levels likely involve ongoing "silent" myocardial ischemia or a generally compromised coronary status. Silent ischemia, characterized by ischemic episodes without overt clinical symptoms, may occur in patients with severe multivessel CAD or microvascular dysfunction. In patients with complex CAD, increased preoperative hs-cTnT levels were observed earlier.

Conditions such as myocardial infarction with nonobstructive coronary arteries further exemplify how subtle ischemic damage can lead to elevated cardiac biomarkers.

In elective patients with significantly elevated hs-cTnT (> 3× URL), further preoperative work-up may be warranted, including detailed clinical examination, serial hs-cTnT measurements, and electrocardiography monitoring, to identify potential dynamic changes indicative of acute coronary syndrome. Detecting dynamic changes could differentiate between chronic myocardial injury and acute ischemic events, informing decisions regarding the timing of surgery, and potentially postponement — or expedition — of the procedure.

The optimal management of patients with elevated preoperative hs-cTnT remains an area of debate. One possible strategy involves postponing surgery to allow resolution of silent ischemia, thereby reducing the risk of perioperative myocardial injury. However, delaying surgery could also exacerbate ischemic injury, particularly in patients with ongoing myocardial compromise. Notably, we observed higher postoperative hs-cTnT levels in patients with elevated preoperative levels, suggesting greater vulnerability to perioperative myocardial injury. This raises the possibility that early surgical intervention may mitigate the progression of myocardial damage. Potential clinical implications, as the impact of surgical timing on clinical outcomes in patients with elevated preoperative hs-cTnT levels, have to be tested in future prospective studies.

Our findings support the use of preoperative hs-cTnT levels as a robust risk stratification tool for patients undergoing CABG. By reflecting the global health status of patients, including cardiac reserve and comorbidities, hs-cTnT can identify individuals at higher risk of adverse outcomes. Additionally, hs-cTnT levels may inform the choice of revascularization strategy, particularly in patients with chronic coronary syndromes. While CABG is the preferred option for multivessel disease, elevated hs-cTnT levels might indicate higher perioperative risks, prompting consideration of percutaneous coronary intervention as an alternative. Due to the exploratory nature of this study, further studies are needed to explore thresholds of hs-cTnT that may guide the decision-making process between CABG and percutaneous coronary intervention.

Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) evidence-based protocols for perioperative care can lead to improvements in clinical outcomes and cost savings. This article aims to present consensus recommendations for the optimal perioperative management of patients undergoing cardiac surgery. A review of meta-analyses, randomized clinical trials, large nonrandomized studies, and reviews was conducted for each protocol element. The quality of the evidence was graded and used to form consensus recommendations for each topic. Development of these recommendations was endorsed by the Enhanced Recovery After Surgery Society.

### Coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG) off or on pump revascularization study (CORONARY) [^116dRts5]. ClinicalTrials (2007). Low credibility.

Rationale and purpose of the study: Coronary artery bypass grafting surgery prolongs life-expectancy in patients with severe ischemic heart disease, especially those with left main, triple vessel disease or single/double vessel disease with stenosis of the proximal left anterior descending artery. The perioperative mortality is about 2% with an additional 5% to 7% suffering complications such as myocardial infarction, stroke, renal failure, etc. The cumulative event rate at 30 days for on-pump CABG is estimated as being 8. 6% and the investigators expect a 33% relative risk reduction for the off-pump CABG group. The sample calculated for the whole trial is 4700 patients.

Primary outcomes:

- The occurrence of the composite of total mortality, stroke, nonfatal MI, or new renal failure at 30 days post CABG surgery AND
- The occurrence of the composite of total mortality, stroke, nonfatal MI, new renal failure, or repeat coronary revascularization over 5 years after randomization.
- **MI perioperative**: new pathologic Q waves with documented new wall motion abnormalities other than septal OR cardiac markers ≥ 10 × ULN.
- **MI non-perioperative**: ECG changes consistent with infarction or evolving ST-segment to T-wave changes in two contiguous leads or new left bundle branch block or ST segment elevation requiring thrombolysis or PCI AND cardiac markers in the necrosis range.

The treatment effect as measured by the hazard ratio and 95% confidence interval will be derived by the Cox proportional hazards model. The investigators will also calculate the absolute risk reductions and the associated 95% confidence intervals, as well as the number needed to treat with off-pump CABG to prevent one major cardiovascular event. Participants who prematurely discontinue follow-up before a major cardiovascular event will be censored as to their last follow-up data; this number is expected to be < 1% given the relatively short period of follow-up after surgery.

Using peri-operative myocardial injury and type 5 myocardial infarction to assess the cardioprotective efficacy of novel therapies in the setting of coronary artery bypass graft surgery

Cardioprotective strategies such as ischaemic preconditioning (IPC), ischaemic post-conditioning (IPost), remote ischaemic preconditioning (RIPC), and a number of drugs including volatile anesthetics which recruit the signal transduction pathways underlying conditioning, have been shown to attenuate myocardial injury following acute ischaemia-reperfusion injury. Ischaemic cardioplegic arrest on cardiopulmonary bypass with subsequent reperfusion was therefore considered an ideal and well controlled clinical setting to translate findings from animal experiments to humans. In fact, a number of smaller studies have reported reduced MI size with IPC, IPost, and RIPC (for review see reference), and cyclosporine A. These studies used biomarker release (CK, CK-MB, and cTn) to quantify PMI. It is important to note that the majority of studies have measured the magnitude of PMI to assess the cardioprotective efficacy of novel therapies, and did not investigate whether the new intervention was able to reduce the incidence of Type 5 MI or mortality. Two moderately sized trials also reported improved clinical outcomes with RIPC at short-or more long-termas a secondary endpoints.

In contrast to these encouraging phase II a studies, two recent larger phase III trials assessing RIPC neither confirmed reduced biomarker (cTnT or cTnI) release nor improved clinical outcomes during hospitalizationor at one year follow-up. In both these neutral trials, less than 50% of patients had only CABG surgery, and the others had either additional or only valvular surgery. Valvular surgery causes greater traumatic injury than CABG, and the contribution of trauma to total biomarker release may have diluted a potential cardioprotective effect of remote ischaemic preconditioning. In contrast to these larger trials, the original positive phase II trials had only recruited patients undergoing CABG surgery. There are also other causes of biomarker release such as bypass graft failureor microembolization of atherothrombotic debris, which are not associated with subsequent reperfusion injury and from which, therefore, no protection by conditioning or drugs is expected. More disconcerting than the lack of reduction in biomarker release is the lack of improved clinical outcomes, which retrospectively also confirms the lack of reduced biomarker release in the two recent phase III trials. Therefore, the search for novel biomarkers specific to cardioprotection by ischaemic conditioning such as protectomiRsis of particular interest.

### Coronary artery revascularization in the older adult population: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^114HmJJN]. Circulation (2025). High credibility.

When is surgery preferable — decision considerations for older adults with coronary artery disease — emphasizes that older patients with substantial disease warranting revascularization are often excluded from randomized clinical trials comparing PCI and CABG, yet older patients who undergo revascularization receive benefits such as relief of symptoms, reduced risk of future myocardial infarction, and improved survival rates; similar to younger patients, older adults have been found to have improved survival, lower risk of repeat revascularization, lower risk of subsequent myocardial infarction, and higher perioperative mortality after CABG compared with PCI in retrospective studies, propensity-matched analyses, and meta-analyses, while comparable outcomes between PCI and CABG were noted in a subgroup analysis and extended follow-up of a large randomized trial; because older patients may have more comorbidities and unique preferences, a careful assessment is warranted when considering PCI or CABG, including evaluation of technical candidacy and procedural risk, a heart team discussion, and consideration of patient preferences, cognitive function, and life expectancy.

### Comparative efficacy and safety of no-touch versus conventional vein harvesting techniques in coronary artery bypass grafting: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111s732E]. Open Heart (2025). Medium credibility.

Future implications

This meta-analysis sheds light on both the advantages and challenges associated with NT compared with conventional treatment. The findings suggest that NT significantly reduces the risk of graft failure and occlusion, which could have meaningful implications for long-term patient outcomes. However, the increased risk of leg infections raises concerns that warrant further investigation into patient selection and postoperative management strategies. To strengthen these findings, future research should prioritise well-designed RCTs with standardised protocols. Long-term studies focusing on patient-centred outcomes — such as functional recovery, quality of life and healthcare costs — are essential to determine NT's broader clinical impact. The absence of significant differences in secondary outcomes like revascularisation, overall mortality and MI suggests that while NT improves graft patency, its influence on broader cardiovascular endpoints remains uncertain. Future investigations should explore whether specific patient characteristics, surgical techniques or perioperative management strategies influence NT's effectiveness. Moreover, the increased risk of leg infections underscores the need for improved preventive strategies, such as refined perioperative antibiotic protocols and enhanced wound care. Understanding the underlying mechanisms behind this complication could help develop targeted interventions that maximise NT's benefits while minimising risks. Given the variability in NT's adoption worldwide, collaborative efforts, including multicentre trials and real-world registry analyses, could help refine clinical guidelines and optimise treatment approaches.

### Prognostic value of early postoperative troponin T in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting [^111mLCL5]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery is an established revascularization strategy for adults with multivessel coronary artery disease. However, patients who undergo CABG may develop periprocedural complications, such as myocardial infarction (MI), cardiogenic shock, stroke, acute kidney injury, and others. Early identification of complications after CABG is important to allow quick therapeutic strategies, such as emergent reexploration of grafts, immediate coronary angiography with or without percutaneous intervention, insertion of intra‐aortic balloon pump, and additional monitoring in the intensive care unit.

Cardiac troponin is unsurprisingly elevated after CABG and may be a consequence of insufficient myocardial protection or myocardial ischemia related to inadequate reperfusion. 1, 2, 3 Therefore, it remains unclear how to interpret changes of troponin values in the postoperative setting and whether troponin elevations have a prognostic value for in‐hospital complications after CABG. Existing studies on the association between troponin elevations after CABG and in‐hospital complications also have important limitations. 4, 5, 6, 7 First, investigators have examined adults undergoing all cardiac surgical procedures as opposed to limiting their analysis to CABG. Because the magnitude of postoperative troponin elevation varies according to the cardiac surgical procedure, 5 the clinical applicability of these studies to adults undergoing isolated CABG is limited. 4, 5, 6 Second, few studies focused on troponin elevations measured earlier than 24 hours, 4, 7 and the window of opportunity to meaningfully improve a patient's postoperative prognosis may have closed after the first postoperative day. Earlier postoperative assessment of troponin is, therefore, necessary to improve the clinical management of patients undergoing CABG. To our knowledge, only 3 small studies have assessed the association between troponin measurements taken at ≤ 12 hours postoperatively and subsequent in‐hospital complications. In the first study, troponin I (TnI) was measured immediately after CABG in 540 adults and, if elevated, was associated with a 17‐fold increase in perioperative MI or death. 8 In the second study, troponin T measured between 8 and 16 hours postoperatively had moderate to high discrimination (area under the curve, ≥ 0.73) for perioperative MI. 9 The third study was a pilot study conducted by our group. 10 Among 290 adults undergoing isolated CABG, we demonstrated that a cardiac troponin T (cTnT) increase of 1000 ng/L, measured at a mean 8.1 hours postoperatively, was associated with a 7‐fold increase in in‐hospital complications, including periprocedural MI, prolonged need for vasopressors, and new‐onset renal insufficiency. We also reported that a cutoff of 800 ng/L is useful to identify patients at risk for subsequent complications. Although presurgical risk scores, such as the EuroSCORE, show some association with postsurgical outcomes, this is moderate at best. It would be desirable to have a marker assessed early in the postoperative course with a more pronounced association with postoperative course of patients that could be used for clinical decision making.

### Intra-operative and post-operative management of conduits for coronary artery bypass grafting: a clinical consensus statement of the European Society of Cardiology working group on cardiovascular surgery and the European Association for Cardio-thoracic Surgery coronary task force [^113FrTPp]. European Heart Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Current clinical practice is to continue antiplatelet therapy life-long after CABG, but evidence in support of a clinical benefit is limited. There is in fact little evidence to support a clinical benefit, as opposed to a graft patency benefit, from aspirin use after CABG. Most studies showed no effect on mortality, or even a trend to excess mortality, but they were underpowered for small to moderate differences in clinical outcomes and, in particular, in mortality. However, a pooled analysis of 7 contemporary RCTs with systematic graft imaging (4413 patients, 13 163 grafts) showed that graft failure is strongly associated with adverse cardiac events (adjusted OR 3.98, 95% CI 3.54–4.47, P < .001) and mortality after CABG (adjusted OR 2.79, 95% CI 2.01–3.89, P < .001), indirectly supporting a potential clinical benefit of aspirin. On the other hand, 1 trial randomized 213 patients 1 year after CABG to continue aspirin 325 mg/day or switch to placebo for the following 2 years and found no difference in the rate of graft occlusion, MI, or death (although the trial was not formally powered and the described power limitations apply).

### Current evidence for perioperative statins in cardiac surgery [^116bkXfA]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Cardiac surgery improves life expectancy and quality of life for the constantly ageing population in developed countries. Mediated by their lipid-dependent and lipid-independent mechanisms, statins are sought to provide benefit with regard to better outcomes after cardiac surgery. Current guidelines recommend statin use in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting, while less evidence is available for patients referred to heart valve surgery. Optimal selection of statin drug and dosage including perioperative timing of statin therapy remains largely unknown, but results of ongoing meta-analyses and future randomized trials will add important evidence to guide perioperative statin treatment of cardiac surgery patients.

### Survival, adverse events and management of silent in-hospital coronary bypass graft occlusion [^11593vMV]. Open Heart (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is the standard of care for severe coronary artery disease and remains the most performed cardiac surgical procedure. Although considered routine, CABG carries substantial risks, particularly for patients with advanced cardiovascular profiles. Perioperative myocardial infarction (PMI) is a serious and life-threatening complication of CABG, associated with significantly increased mortality. Postoperative, clinically manifesting graft occlusions occur in 5–17% of cases, yet their incidence as well as impact on short- and long-term outcomes remain inadequately characterised.

The diagnosis and management of postoperative silent coronary bypass occlusion present significant challenges. Regarding its silent nature, there is a complete absence of classical signs of myocardial infarction (MI), such as changes in the ECG, significant elevations in ischaemia biomarkers, and new wall motion abnormalities on the echocardiogram. Its risk factors are not fully understood, making its prediction difficult. On the other hand, the absence of classical clinical symptoms may lead to missed diagnoses unless the graft patency is systematically evaluated during the hospital stay. The complexity of in-hospital CABG occlusion diagnosis is highlighted by evidence showing that up to 35% of patients with clinical signs suggestive of PMI have no detectable coronary bypass graft occlusion. The diagnosis, clinical prevention and treatment of PMI is important since the event is associated with repeated revascularisation and increased mortality following CABG.

Many asymptomatic cases are undiagnosed without systematic coronary CT (cCT), delaying intervention, while the prognostic impact of early postoperative silent graft occlusion remains unclear. Given the scarcity of literature on early postoperative silent bypass graft occlusion and its impact on patient outcomes, a thorough understanding of its prognostic implications remains an urgent and unaddressed clinical need. To bridge this gap, we aimed to assess clinical outcomes in patients with early silent coronary bypass occlusion, with a particular focus on the need for mid-term revascularisation, mortality and the incidence of major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (MACCE).

### Commentary: in the hands of the few, less is more [^113zG4Sr]. JTCVS Techniques (2021). Medium credibility.

Nonetheless, various opportunities do arise. The Minimally Invasive versus STernotomy (MIST) clinical trial (NCT03447938) is the first trial comparing MICS-CABG versus conventional sternotomy CABG. The trial spans 13 centers across 7 countries and is currently halfway in its recruitment toward 176 patients, who will be followed for up to 5 years. The primary end point of MIST is patient-reported early postoperative quality of life (the Physical Component Summary of the SF-36 questionnaire) at 4 weeks after surgery, and the trial is powered for a mean difference of 5 points between groups — the minimally important difference. The multicenter, multinational study design will help with generalizability, although the small sample size will mean that comparisons of clinical outcomes will likely be underpowered unless the differences are very large. In addition, there is ongoing debate about the benefits of OPCAB, given variable outcomes across trials and observational studies. While OPCAB is technically easier to perform than MICS-CABG, the inconsistent outcomes have resulted in gradually declining OPCAB volumes in North America.

In the end, we must place patients first. Quality of life should be considered with every treatment decision, beginning with minimizing the invasiveness of surgical approaches in a safe and quality manner. However, we should retain cautious optimism: MICS-CABG, while promising, may only ever be advantageous in the hands of the few.

### A pilot randomized controlled trial comparing CABG surgery performed with total arterial grafts or without… [^114rkYqg]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

In the present study we chose to evaluate graft patency between groups with CT- Angiography based on its limited invasiveness, safety and reported accuracy in assessing graft patency. However, we were surprised to report that significant difficulty in assessing graft patency may be an issue in up to 5% of grafts, particularly when evaluating sequential grafts on the lateral wall. Previous authors using the same scanner hardware and similar scanning protocols have reported varying results in terms of non – evaluable grafts ranging from 0% to 13%. More recent studies using improved hardware and scanning protocols have also reported a small percentage of non-evaluable grafts. In support of our observation is the observation by others that arterial grafts to the lateral wall may be particularly difficult to visualize. Although the absolute numbers of non-diagnostic grafts are small, the low incidence rate of stenosis or occlusion calls into question the utility of CT-angio for the purpose of graft evaluation in this study population. Our findings appear to confirm that coronary angiography remains the gold standard for evaluation of coronary artery bypass grafts patency. More importantly for the design of endpoints in a trial comparing grafting strategies our observed difficulty with graft visualization would need to be taken into consideration for power calculations. One should note that CT technology is continuing to improve significantly such that this limitation may no longer be an issue in the future.

### Preoperative coronary interventions for preventing acute myocardial infarction in the perioperative period of major open vascular or endovascular surgery [^1156dCiU]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Postoperative myocardial infarction (POMI) is associated with major surgeries and remains the leading cause of mortality and morbidity in people undergoing vascular surgery, with an incidence rate ranging from 5% to 20%. Preoperative coronary interventions, such as coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) or percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI), may help prevent acute myocardial infarction in the perioperative period of major vascular surgery when used in addition to routine perioperative drugs (e.g. statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and antiplatelet agents), CABG by creating new blood circulation routes that bypass the blockages in the coronary vessels, and PCI by opening up blocked blood vessels. There is currently uncertainty around the benefits and harms of preoperative coronary interventions.

Objectives

To assess the effects of preoperative coronary interventions for preventing acute myocardial infarction in the perioperative period of major open vascular or endovascular surgery.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE Ovid, Embase Ovid, LILACS, and CINAHL EBSCO on 13 March 2023. We also searched the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs that compared the use of preoperative coronary interventions plus usual care versus usual care for preventing acute myocardial infarction during major open vascular or endovascular surgery. We included participants of any sex or any age undergoing major open vascular surgery, major endovascular surgery, or hybrid vascular surgery.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes of interest were acute myocardial infarction, all-cause mortality, and adverse events resulting from preoperative coronary interventions. Our secondary outcomes were cardiovascular mortality, quality of life, vessel or graft secondary patency, and length of hospital stay. We reported perioperative and long-term outcomes (more than 30 days after intervention). We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We included three RCTs (1144 participants). Participants were randomised to receive either preoperative coronary revascularisation with PCI or CABG plus usual care or only usual care before major vascular surgery. One trial enrolled participants if they had no apparent evidence of coronary artery disease. Another trial selected participants classified as high risk for coronary disease through preoperative clinical and laboratorial testing. We excluded one trial from the meta-analysis because participants from both the control and the intervention groups were eligible to undergo preoperative coronary revascularisation. We identified a high risk of performance bias in all included trials, with one trial displaying a high risk of other bias. However, the risk of bias was either low or unclear in other domains. We observed no difference between groups for perioperative acute myocardial infarction, but the evidence is very uncertain (risk ratio (RR) 0.28, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.02 to 4.57; 2 trials, 888 participants; very low-certainty evidence). One trial showed a reduction in incidence of long-term (> 30 days) acute myocardial infarction in participants allocated to the preoperative coronary interventions plus usual care group, but the evidence was very uncertain (RR 0.09, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.28; 1 trial, 426 participants; very low-certainty evidence). There was little to no effect on all-cause mortality in the perioperative period when comparing the preoperative coronary intervention plus usual care group to usual care alone, but the evidence is very uncertain (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.31 to 2.04; 2 trials, 888 participants; very low-certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of preoperative coronary interventions on long-term (follow up: 2.7 to 6.2 years) all-cause mortality (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.30 to 1.80; 2 trials, 888 participants; very low-certainty evidence). One study reported no adverse effects related to coronary angiography, whereas the other two studies reported five deaths due to revascularisations. There may be no effect on cardiovascular mortality when comparing preoperative coronary revascularisation plus usual care to usual care in the short term (RR 0.07, 95% CI 0.00 to 1.32; 1 trial, 426 participants; low-certainty evidence). Preoperative coronary interventions plus usual care in the short term may reduce length of hospital stay slightly when compared to usual care alone (mean difference -1.17 days, 95% CI -2.05 to -0.28; 1 trial, 462 participants; low-certainty evidence). We downgraded the certainty of the evidence due to concerns about risk of bias, imprecision, and inconsistency. None of the included trials reported on quality of life or vessel graft patency at either time point, and no study reported on adverse effects, cardiovascular mortality, or length of hospital stay at long-term follow-up.

Authors' Conclusions

Preoperative coronary interventions plus usual care may have little or no effect on preventing perioperative acute myocardial infarction and reducing perioperative all-cause mortality compared to usual care, but the evidence is very uncertain. Similarly, limited, very low-certainty evidence shows that preoperative coronary interventions may have little or no effect on reducing long-term all-cause mortality. There is very low-certainty evidence that preoperative coronary interventions plus usual care may prevent long-term myocardial infarction, and low-certainty evidence that they may reduce length of hospital stay slightly, but not cardiovascular mortality in the short term, when compared to usual care alone. Adverse effects of preoperative coronary interventions were poorly reported in trials. Quality of life and vessel or graft patency were not reported. We downgraded the certainty of the evidence most frequently for high risk of bias, inconsistency, or imprecision. None of the analysed trials provided significant data on subgroups of patients who could potentially experience more substantial benefits from preoperative coronary intervention (e.g. altered ventricular ejection fraction). There is a need for evidence from larger and homogeneous RCTs to provide adequate statistical power to assess the role of preoperative coronary interventions for preventing acute myocardial infarction in the perioperative period of major open vascular or endovascular surgery.

Additional outcomes

Time-to-event outcomes (e.g. time to death, hospital LOS, and ICU LOS) will be analyzed using Cox regression, while binary outcomes (e.g. minor perioperative complication composite (Table 2), delirium, and PONV) will be analyzed using logistic regression, and continuous variables (including SF-12) using linear regression or a non-parametric alternative. Additional analyses will be performed adjusting for any baseline potentially confounding factors for which clinical imbalance between randomized groups is observed. The significance level will be 0.05 for all main effect hypotheses, and 0.10 for interactions. Table 3 summarizes the timing of interventions and outcomes' measures.

Interim Monitoring Plan and Adaptive Design Options

The first stage of the study will be a traditional (i.e. non-adaptive) group sequential design, where interim analyses for both efficacy and futility will be conducted after 25%, 50% and 75% of the patients have been enrolled, and at the end of planned enrollment, as needed. Interventions with either a large or very small treatment effect will likely cross boundaries for efficacy or futility, respectively, at one of the interim analyses, and be stopped early. By the final analysis (including a possible adaptive stage, as explained below), all of the interventions will have either crossed an efficacy or futility boundary.

### Cost-effectiveness of coronary artery bypass grafting and percutaneous coronary intervention in patients with chronic kidney disease and acute coronary syndromes in the US Medicare program [^1124CGoj]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Using clinical and economic outcomes data from a moderately large Medicare sample, we projected the long‐term cost‐effectiveness of coronary revascularization in patients with CKD and high‐risk CAD presentations. We found that PCI and CABG were both associated with up‐front risks and markedly increased costs but produced eventual gains in quality‐adjusted life expectancy, with ICERs indicating intermediate value in health economic terms. The magnitude of the modeled health benefits, although uncertain, suggests that revascularization should not be withheld on either clinical or economic grounds when safely feasible.

### Study details | NCT00402506-clinical trials… [^1117DLh4]. ClinicalTrials (2006). Low credibility.

Study Overview Coronary artery bypass grafting effectively relieves angina, results in longer survival, and a better quality of life in specific subgroups of patients with obstructive coronary artery disease. Due to the high incidence of coronary artery disease worldwide, as well as the effectiveness of the surgical procedure, CABG surgery makes up one of the top ten most frequently performed procedures in North America and Europe. In the United States it is estimated that approximately 467, 000 CABG procedures were performed in 2003. Despite the benefits of CABG surgery, patients undergoing these procedures may also suffer serious adverse outcomes including operative mortality, myocardial infarction, unstable angina, ventricular failure, life-threatening arrhythmia, renal insufficiency, and stroke. Some of the proposed causes of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality after CABG include perioperative ischemia, inadequate myocardial protection and reperfusion injury.

The impact of these serious complications is significant. Incidence rates of death and MI following CABG surgery range from 5% to 12% depending on risk status. Results from large clinical trials have recently demonstrated the importance of neurologic deficits as a problematic outcome of CABG. These deficits include memory impairment, psychomotor, visuospatial, attention and language abilities as measured by neuropsychological testing as well as sensorimotor abnormalities associated with stroke.

### Learning curve in off-pump coronary artery bypass graft surgery in a low-income country: a single-center experience [^112CMbHA]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Interestingly, although ICU time did not reach statistical significance, the absolute reduction from approximately 1.76 to 0.94 days was clinically meaningful. Reducing ICU occupancy by nearly one day per patient translates into improved patient turnover, allowing for the earlier admission of new surgical or critical care cases, thereby maximizing bed availability and enhancing workflow efficiency. In our setting, ICU turnover is a key operational metric; the observed reduction suggests fewer ventilator-associated complications, lower nursing workload, and earlier initiation of postoperative mobilization in patients. Studies from other low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) have shown that optimizing ICU throughput contributes to better resource allocation, reduced nosocomial infection rates, and overall cost savings. These findings suggest that even modest improvements in ICU efficiency can have significant downstream effects on institutional capacity and patient outcomes in high-demand tertiary centers. Thus, while statistical significance may be absent, the clinical and operational implications of a reduced ICU burden remain compelling.

The shorter ICU duration also suggests increased surgeon confidence in early extubation and hemodynamic stabilization, likely stemming from the procedural mastery achieved after the learning transition. While external factors, such as ICU discharge policies and bed availability, may influence this metric, the downward trend reflects positively on perioperative management improvements that coincide with growing surgical experience. Nevertheless, the clear reduction in postoperative hospital stay indicates a tangible benefit to the hospital system and patient recovery timelines, potentially easing hospital burden and increasing patient turnover in high-demand settings.

The observed reduction in ICU stays, ventilation time, and improved anastomosis efficiency identified in this study are clinically meaningful. Prior research has demonstrated that optimizing these perioperative parameters correlates positively with enhanced long-term patient recovery, graft patency, and overall outcomes following coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Kieser et al. reported that decreased operative times and improved perioperative efficiency significantly enhanced graft patency and patient outcomes at long-term follow-up. Additionally, shorter ventilation duration and ICU stay have been associated with reduced postoperative complications, faster patient mobilization, and improved functional recovery. In our series, the observed postoperative 100% graft patency rate indirectly supports the anticipated favorable long-term graft outcomes. Future prospective studies with explicit long-term survival and graft patency assessments are warranted to confirm these benefits.

Perioperative patient counseling — Smoking cessation before surgery should be routinely recommended to every smoker seen for a preoperative evaluation, regardless of how soon surgery is planned, with benefit increasing with the duration of preoperative abstinence and even brief cessation having benefit; the perioperative risks of smoking are well established and include infection, MI, neurological complications, increased requirement for pain medications, prolonged length of stay, intensive care unit admission, and death; smokers undergoing elective surgery have increased odds of thromboembolism, respiratory and wound complications, unplanned hospital readmissions, and mortality, with excess risk lasting at least 1 year after surgery; patients continuing to smoke following percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass surgery face poorer long-term outcomes, losing 2 to 3 years of life expectancy compared with those who stop smoking.

On-pump arrested-heart CABG — myocardial protection evidence shows superiority of blood over crystalloid cardioplegia and no definitive advantage of warm over cold solutions. Specifically, "Most studies compared blood versus crystalloid solutions, and these consistently support the superiority of blood cardioplegia". A "meta-analysis of 12 studies, including 2866 patients, found that prevalence of perioperative myocardial infarction was lower in patients who received blood cardioplegia". Conversely, "no definitive data exist on the superiority of warm over cold cardioplegia", and a "meta-analysis of 41 randomized clinical trials (RCT) found that warm cardioplegia did not improve clinical outcomes, but was associated with a mild reduction of cardiac enzyme release". Although single-dose strategies can shorten operative metrics, "the benefit was generally limited to a reduction in ischemia and bypass times and did not translate into a major morbidity or mortality advantage".

### Quality of life after percutaneous coronary intervention versus coronary artery bypass grafting [^113ZycH3]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

For patients with CAD, whether and how to undergo revascularization are important treatment considerations. Current guidelines emphasize the importance of shared decision‐making, for which describing differences in QoL improvement is critical. The present meta‐analysis extends prior work describing the differences in clinical events to explore the differences in improvement in QoL, a critically important outcome for patients, following CABG and PCI from 5 RCTs enrolling 10 760 patients. Overall, both CABG and PCI provided marked long‐term improvements in patients' disease‐specific and generic QoL compared with baseline, as shown by the mean changes that markedly exceeded the minimally clinically important differences (eg, 5–8 points in the SAQ).

In general, we found greater improvements in QoL with PCI at 1 month and either similar or better improvements in QoL at 12 months with CABG. Differences between procedures were larger for disease‐specific physical symptoms, such as angina relief, but were also evident for physical function and generic health status. At the latest follow‐up (36–60 months) there were no significant differences in either disease‐specific or generic QoL between the procedures except for a small gain in SAQ‐QoL favoring CABG (≈3 points). Of note, 2 out of 3 studies ended follow‐up at 36 months, and only 1 study reported data out to 60 months. Describing the trajectory of recovery in more depth, by having complete data at 36 and 60 months (and ideally up to 10 years) would provide more clarity on the differences in longer‐term outcomes between PCI and CABG.

### Perioperative management of antithrombotic therapy: an American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guideline [^116LfKye]. Chest (2022). High credibility.

Patients with coronary stents having surgery — Perioperative antiplatelet management evidence indicates that stent thrombosis "occurs in 2% to 5% of patients and is associated with mortality as high as 50%". In a POISE-2 subanalysis of "470 patients with a coronary stent who required major non-cardiac surgery", continuing ASA preoperatively was associated with lower myocardial infarction "(5.1% vs 11.0%; HR = 0.45; 95% CI: 0.22–0.87)" but a small increase in major bleeding "(4.6% vs 3.8%; HR = 1.22; 95% CI: 1.01–1.48)". Observational data found that interruption "for > 5 days" predicted major adverse events "(OR = 2.11; 95% CI: 1.23–3.63)" and "no perioperative antiplatelet therapy" also increased risk "(OR = 3.73; 95% CI: 1.26–11.07)". A systematic review reported variable adverse cardiovascular event rates "(0%-21%)" and bleeding "(0%-22%)" across strategies and "no observable pattern of adverse outcome incidence". Timing studies noted highest risk in the first "6 weeks after stent placement (8% to 10%)" with rates that "plateau at 6 months (1%–2%) and remain stable at 24 months". In a database study comparing "4,303 patients with and 20,232 patients without" recent drug-eluting stent placement, stenting was associated with higher myocardial infarction "(1.6% vs 0.2%; OR = 4.82; 95% CI: 3.25–7.16)" and cardiac death "(1.0% vs 0.2%; OR = 5.87; 95% CI: 3.60–9.58)", significant only if surgery occurred "within 1 month of stenting". Regarding bridging, an IV cangrelor randomized trial reported no effect on CABG-related bleeding "(OR = 1.15; 95% CI: 0.47–2.79)" or other adverse events "(7.8% vs 5.2%; P = 0.45)", and observational studies of "IV UFH", "subcutaneous LMWH", or "short-acting IV glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors" found "no clear benefits of these approaches".

### Perioperative statin therapy in cardiac surgery: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^115iHsvK]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

With a total of 23 randomized trials and a cumulative patient cohort of 5102 patients, this was the largest meta-analysis of RCTs performed so far. The largest previous meta-analysis of RCTs included only 17 trials and 2138 patients and found no difference in any postoperative outcomes except for AF. However, the results of the aforementioned review were mainly driven by data with high risk of bias and did not include the two largest recently performed trials with low risk of bias trials.

The included trials with low risk of bias were placebo-controlled, recruiting 2637 patients, 43% already on statin therapy, who underwent CABG surgery in about 78% of the cases. Current guidelines suggest that all patients undergoing CABG should receive or continue statin therapy, unless it is contraindicated, and statin discontinuation is not recommended before or after CABG because of possible harmful effects. In light of the results of the present systematic review and of the recently published high-quality trials, the class and level of evidence of these recommendations should be revised, as current randomized evidence does not support the broad use of statin therapy in the perioperative period to improve patients' outcomes. However, even if the majority of patients included in our analysis underwent CABG, we cannot rule out a possible class effect of statin therapy, although our meta-regression and the larger published trials did not suggest subpopulation effects.

In the authors' opinion, this meta-analysis would support a neutral effect of perioperative statin therapy or perhaps weak evidence of a clinically significant detrimental effect on patients' outcomes. The exact time-point for interruption of preoperative statin therapy in patients already taking a statin should be further evaluated. Billings and colleagues randomized patients on chronic statin therapy to intervention only on the day of the surgery and on the first postoperative day. On the other hand, Zheng and colleagues interrupted statin therapy during the 8 days before surgery, with about two thirds of the patients having therapy interrupted during the 4 days before surgery. However, the length of perioperative statin regimen varies among trials and no recommendations could be made.

### The effect of postoperative complications on health-related quality of life and survival 12 years after coronary artery bypass grafting-a prospective cohort study [^112Qj7yY]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) has remained the most commonly performed cardiac surgery procedure over the past decades. The main goal of the surgery is to improve survival and health related quality of life (QoL). Despite the fact that the profile of patients undergoing isolated CABG surgery has changed towards higher age with increased frequency of preoperative co-morbidities mortality and severe morbidity after CABG have even decreased over past decades. However, the life-expectancy of older and more moribund patients may be limited due to natural causes which emphasizes the importance of QoL as indication for surgery.

Whilst CABG surgery's safety and efficacy in treating patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) is well-established, the complications of the surgery still remain a burden causing mortality, morbidity and decrease in QoL. The outcomes of CABG surgery are mainly studied in terms of survival benefit and relief from cardiac related symptoms. Yet, there is a lack of long-term data on the effects of postoperative complications on QoL. In this prospective cohort study we evaluated the impact of postoperative complications on long term health related QoL and survival 12 years after CABG procedure. Special interest was focused on the impact of major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE) on postoperative quality of life.

Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) programs have been shown to lessen surgical insult, promote recovery, and improve postoperative clinical outcomes across a number of specialty operations. A core tenet of ERAS involves the provision of protocolized evidence-based perioperative interventions. Given both the growing enthusiasm for applying ERAS principles to cardiac surgery and the broad scope of relevant interventions, an international, multidisciplinary expert panel was assembled to derive a list of potential program elements, review the literature, and provide a statement regarding clinical practice for each topic area. This article summarizes those consensus statements and their accompanying evidence. These results provide the foundation for best practice for the management of the adult patient undergoing cardiac surgery.

Perioperative cardiac risk — background burden and context are highlighted: Perioperative cardiac complications are an important concern for the 230 million individuals who undergo surgery worldwide every year, and after surgery, 2% suffer major cardiac complications and 8% show evidence of significant myocardial injury. The field saw early enthusiasm for perioperative beta blockade based on promising results in 2 RCTs, and guideline history noted a Class II recommendation in 1996 and a Class IIa recommendation in 2002. It is also noted that in the POISE-1 trial, although perioperative beta blockade prevented perioperative MI, this benefit was accompanied by increased risks of death, stroke, hypotension, and bradycardia.

### Clinical benefit of steroid use in patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass: a meta-analysis of randomized trials [^113FdMxe]. European Heart Journal (2008). Low credibility.

We sought to establish the efficacy and safety of prophylactic steroids in adult patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). We performed a meta-analysis of randomized trials reporting the effects of prophylactic steroids on clinical outcomes after CPB. Outcomes examined were mortality, myocardial infarction, neurological events, new onset atrial fibrillation, transfusion requirements, postoperative bleeding, duration of ventilation, intensive care unit (ICU) stay, hospital stay, wound complications, gastrointestinal complications, and infectious complications. We included 44 trials randomizing 3205 patients. Steroids reduced new onset atrial fibrillation [relative risk (RR) 0.71, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.59 to 0.87], postoperative bleeding [weighted mean difference (WMD) -99.6 mL, 95% CI -149.8 to -49.3], and duration of ICU stay (WMD -0.23 days, 95% CI -0.40 to -0.07). Length of hospital stay was also reduced (WMD -0.59 days, 95% CI -1.17 to -0.02), but this result was less robust. A trend towards reduction in mortality was observed (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.18). Randomized trials suggest that perioperative steroids have significant clinical benefit in CPB patients by decreasing the risk of new onset atrial fibrillation, while results are encouraging for reducing bleeding, length of stay, and mortality. These data do not raise major safety concerns, however, a sufficiently powered trial is warranted to confirm or refute these findings.

### Prophylactic corticosteroids for cardiopulmonary bypass in adult cardiac surgery [^115ds4sD]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Cardiac surgery triggers a strong inflammatory reaction, which carries significant clinical consequences. Corticosteroids have been suggested as a potential perioperative strategy to reduce inflammation and help prevent postoperative complications. However, the safety and effectiveness of perioperative corticosteroid use in adult cardiac surgery is uncertain. This is an update of the 2011 review with 18 studies added.

Objectives

Primary objective: to estimate the effects of prophylactic corticosteroid use in adults undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass on the: - co-primary endpoints of mortality, myocardial complications, and pulmonary complications; and - secondary outcomes including atrial fibrillation, infection, organ injury, known complications of steroid therapy, prolonged mechanical ventilation, prolonged postoperative stay, and cost-effectiveness.

Secondary Objective

to explore the role of characteristics of the study cohort and specific features of the intervention in determining the treatment effects via a series of prespecified subgroup analyses.

Search Methods

We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods to identify randomised studies assessing the effect of corticosteroids in adult cardiac surgery. The latest searches were performed on 14 October 2022.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials in adults (over 18 years, either with a diagnosis of coronary artery disease or cardiac valve disease, or who were candidates for cardiac surgery with the use of cardiopulmonary bypass), comparing corticosteroids with no treatments. There were no restrictions with respect to length of the follow-up period. All selected studies qualified for pooling of results for one or more endpoints.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were all-cause mortality, and cardiac and pulmonary complications. Secondary outcomes were infectious complications, gastrointestinal bleeding, occurrence of new post-surgery atrial fibrillation, re-thoracotomy for bleeding, neurological complications, renal failure, inotropic support, postoperative bleeding, mechanical ventilation time, length of stays in the intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital, patient quality of life, and cost-effectiveness. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for each outcome.

Main Results

This updated review includes 72 randomised trials with 17,282 participants (all 72 trials with 16,962 participants were included in data synthesis). Four trials (6%) were considered at low risk of bias in all the domains. The median age of participants included in the studies was 62.9 years. Study populations consisted mainly (89%) of low-risk, first-time coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) or valve surgery. The use of perioperative corticosteroids may result in little to no difference in all-cause mortality (risk with corticosteroids: 25 to 36 per 1000 versus 33 per 1000 with placebo or no treatment; risk ratio (RR) 0.90, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.75 to 1.07; 25 studies, 14,940 participants; low-certainty evidence). Corticosteroids may increase the risk of myocardial complications (68 to 86 per 1000) compared with placebo or no treatment (66 per 1000; RR 1.16, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.31; 25 studies, 14,766 participants; low-certainty evidence), and may reduce the risk of pulmonary complications (risk with corticosteroids: 61 to 77 per 1000 versus 78 per 1000 with placebo/no treatment; RR 0.88, 0.78 to 0.99; 18 studies, 13,549 participants; low-certainty evidence). Analyses of secondary endpoints showed that corticosteroids may reduce the incidence of infectious complications (risk with corticosteroids: 94 to 113 per 1000 versus 123 per 1000 with placebo/no treatment; RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.76 to 0.92; 28 studies, 14,771 participants; low-certainty evidence). Corticosteroids may result in little to no difference in incidence of gastrointestinal bleeding (risk with corticosteroids: 9 to 17 per 1000 versus 10 per 1000 with placebo/no treatment; RR 1.21, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.67; 6 studies, 12,533 participants; low-certainty evidence) and renal failure (risk with corticosteroids: 23 to 35 per 1000 versus 34 per 1000 with placebo/no treatment; RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.02; 13 studies, 12,799; low-certainty evidence). Corticosteroids may reduce the length of hospital stay, but the evidence is very uncertain (-0.5 days, 0.97 to 0.04 fewer days of length of hospital stay compared with placebo/no treatment; 25 studies, 1841 participants; very low-certainty evidence). The results from the two largest trials included in the review possibly skew the overall findings from the meta-analysis.

Authors' Conclusions

A systematic review of trials evaluating the organ protective effects of corticosteroids in cardiac surgery demonstrated little or no treatment effect on mortality, gastrointestinal bleeding, and renal failure. There were opposing treatment effects on cardiac and pulmonary complications, with evidence that corticosteroids may increase cardiac complications but reduce pulmonary complications; however, the level of certainty for these estimates was low. There were minor benefits from corticosteroid therapy for infectious complications, but the evidence on hospital length of stay was very uncertain. The inconsistent treatment effects across different outcomes and the limited data on high-risk groups reduced the applicability of the findings. Further research should explore the role of these drugs in specific, vulnerable cohorts.

### Effect of percutaneous coronary intervention on quality of life: a consensus statement from the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions [^1158hZKS]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2013). Medium credibility.

PCI improves quality of life — patient selection and comparative outcomes: Quality of life (QoL) improvement after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is proportional to the severity of angina before PCI and adequacy of revascularization, and some co-morbidities limit QoL before and after PCI and may minimize any improvement in QoL resulting from PCI. QoL benefits of PCI over medical therapy decrease over time due to cross-over from medical therapy to PCI, the efficacy of optimal medical therapy, and restenosis or progression of atherosclerosis. QoL after PCI compared with coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is better in the short-term (months), worse in the intermediate term (1–5 years), and probably similar in the long-term (> 5 years) due to bypass graft failure, progression of atherosclerosis in native vessels, and cross-over from PCI to CABG. Many stable ischemic heart disease (SIHD) patients and physicians tend to overestimate the benefits of revascularization procedures and underestimate the safety and effectiveness of medical therapy, and when there is equipoise in the risks/benefits of medical therapy compared with PCI, the preferences of the fully informed patient should play a major role in treatment decisions.

### Ticagrelor and aspirin for the prevention of cardiovascular… [^113eBqAX]. ClinicalTrials (2011). Low credibility.

Ticagrelor and Aspirin for the Prevention of Cardiovascular Events After Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery ClinicalTrials. gov ID.
- Composite of all-cause mortality, MI, stroke, or repeat revascularization
- Improving graft patency
- The secondary study objective is to evaluate if the combination of ticagrelor and aspirin administered after CABG will improve graft patency at 3 months, compared with aspirin alone. This will be monitored and assessing in the CT angiography substudy. Patients will be screened for eligibility pre-CABG, and informed consent signed before randomization. Aspirin 81mg/d will be started within 12 hours of CABG as per routine practice. Study medication will be started within 48 hours after CABG if there are no contraindications. Patients will be randomized to ticagrelor 90mg bid or placebo bid for 1 year following CABG.

Aspirin 81mg/d will be continued for at least 1 year post-CABG. Other cardiac medications will be at the discretion of the treating physicians as per standard practice. Patients will be followed daily during their hospital stay. Outpatient visits will be scheduled at 3, 6 and 12 months. There will also be telephone contacts at 1 and 9 months. CT Substudy: Patients in the CT angiography substudy will have a cardiac CT angiogram to evaluate bypass graft patency at 3-month follow-up. Grafts will be separately evaluated based upon the conduits used, internal mammary, radial, or saphenous vein grafts. CT angiograms will be evaluated by 2 interpreters blinded to the randomized treatment, and will be reviewed by a 3rd interpreter if there are disagreements.

If no consensus could be reached among the 3 interpreters, the graft will be deemed not analyzable, or be subject to invasive coronary angiography for definitive assessment if clinically indicated. The primary efficacy endpoint is the composite of all-cause mortality, MI, stroke, or repeat revascularization within 1 year following CABG. Secondary endpoints include the individual endpoints of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular death, MI, stroke, repeat revascularization. Study Type
- **Coronary Artery Disease Drug**: ticagrelor.

### Association of acute venous thromboembolism with in-hospital outcomes of coronary artery bypass graft surgery [^114vGxBX]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a feared complication in patients undergoing surgical procedures and is associated with significant morbidity, mortality, and hospital costs. 1, 2, 3 As a result, pharmacological prophylaxis against VTE is strongly recommended in the perioperative period for most surgical patients, and is a benchmark used to evaluate quality of care. 4, 5

However, for patients undergoing cardiac surgeries, including coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), VTE prophylaxis is controversial. The incidence of perioperative VTE in CABG patients reported in the literature is low (≈1%). 6, 7, 8 Unfortunately, a majority of the current evidence regarding the incidence and outcomes of VTE, and optimal strategies for VTE prophylaxis in patients undergoing CABG, is from studies with limited sample sizes, and is of moderate‐to‐low quality as acknowledged by guidelines. 9, 10 Moreover, current evidence regarding benefit of prophylaxis versus bleeding complications is inconclusive. 11

Given the volume of patients undergoing CABG, and the significant adverse outcomes associated with perioperative VTE, we believe this issue needs further attention, and that a more robust understanding of the impact of VTE in the perioperative CABG period may help guide clinical management. In this study, we used a large national inpatient database to investigate the incidence and outcomes of perioperative VTE in patients undergoing CABG.

GRADE recommendation strength — "Strong recommendations can be made when there is moderate- or high-quality evidence" that "the net benefits of the intervention clearly outweigh the net harms", and "can also be made even if the level of evidence is poor but values and preferences strongly support the action". Strong recommendations mean "there is certainty that the desirable consequences of the intervention exceed the undesirable consequences", that further research is unlikely to change certainty, and that "nearly all patients would desire the intervention when given the choice". In contrast, "weak recommendations are common, reflecting residual uncertainty about the quality of evidence, the ratio of benefits to harms, and/or variation in patient preferences", yet they remain important because "they explicitly acknowledge uncertainty while still providing evidence-based guidance to clinical practice", and help identify gaps and justify some practice variation.

Comparative outcomes of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) versus CABG — in candidates for either approach, older randomized trials did not show short-term mortality or myocardial infarction differences but consistently found more repeat revascularization after PCI; more recent propensity-matched registries showed improved survival with CABG, and favorable CABG outcomes were linked to more complete revascularization and long-term graft durability. Evidence states that older trials "failed to detect significant differences in short-term death and myocardial infarction (MI) rates, but they consistently observed higher rates of repeat revascularization after PCI compared with CABG", that "large registries that used propensity-matched analyses showed improved survival with CABG", and that favorable CABG results were attributed to "more complete revascularization, and improved long-term outcomes and graft patency".

### Effects of on-and off-pump coronary artery surgery on graft patency, survival, and health-related quality of life: long-term follow-up of 2 randomized controlled trials [^1163omfq]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

Off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting reduces postoperative morbidity and uses fewer resources than conventional surgical intervention with cardiopulmonary bypass. However, only 15% to 20% of coronary artery bypass grafting operations use off-pump coronary artery bypass. One reason for not using off-pump coronary artery bypass might be the surgeon's concern about the long-term patency of grafts performed with this technique. Therefore our objective was to compare long-term outcomes in patients randomized to off-pump coronary artery bypass or coronary artery bypass grafting with cardiopulmonary bypass.

Methods

Participants in 2 randomized trials comparing off-pump coronary artery bypass and coronary artery bypass grafting with cardiopulmonary bypass were followed up for 6 to 8 years after surgical intervention to assess graft patency, major adverse cardiac-related events, and health-related quality of life. Patency was assessed by using multidetector computed tomographic coronary angiographic analysis with a 16-slice scanner. Two blinded observers classified proximal, body, and distal segments of each graft as occluded or not. Major adverse cardiac-related events and health-related quality of life were obtained from questionnaires given to participants and family practitioners.

Results

Patency was studied in 199 and health-related quality of life was studied in 299 of 349 survivors. There was no evidence of attrition bias. The likelihood of graft occlusion was no different between off-pump coronary artery bypass (10.6%) and coronary artery bypass grafting with cardiopulmonary bypass (11.0%) groups (odds ratio, 1.00; 95% confidence interval, 0.55–1.81; P > .99). Graft occlusion was more likely at the distal than the proximal anastomosis (odds ratio, 1.11; 95% confidence interval, 1.02–1.20). There were also no differences between the off-pump coronary artery bypass and coronary artery bypass grafting with cardiopulmonary bypass groups in the hazard of death (hazard ratio, 1.24; 95% confidence interval, 0.72–2.15) or major adverse cardiac-related events or death (hazard ratio, 0.84; 95% confidence interval, 0.58–1.24), or mean health-related quality of life across a range of domains and instruments.

Conclusions

Long-term health outcomes with off-pump coronary artery bypass are similar to those with coronary artery bypass grafting with cardiopulmonary bypass when both operations are performed by experienced surgeons.

### Platelet quiescence in patients with acute coronary syndrome undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery [^115HtCb8]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) benefit from antiplatelet therapy, including platelet P2Y12 receptor inhibitors and glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors; however, in subgroups requiring coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, no dedicated randomized study exists. The concept of "platelet quiescence", the hypothesis of the benefit of residual platelet inhibition extending to the time of CABG and conferring ischemic protection, is long‐standing. 1 Clinically, this possible benefit must be balanced against the risk of antiplatelet drugs predisposing to perioperative bleeding and its sequelae. To explore the hypothesis of more potent platelet inhibition providing net clinical benefit, we conducted a systematic review and meta‐analysis of studies of all antiplatelet agents involving patients admitted with ACS who underwent CABG. To establish overall balance of ischemic versus bleeding risk, we compared those treated with a more potent platelet inhibition strategy with those with a less potent inhibition to determine effects on all‐cause mortality.

### Effect of percutaneous coronary intervention on quality of life: a consensus statement from the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions [^114UaZ9v]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2013). Medium credibility.

Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and quality of life (QoL) — ethical principles, informed consent, and counseling: The fundamental principles of medical ethics are beneficence ("do good, avoid harm"), autonomy, and distributive justice, and the first two are most relevant to PCI and QoL; these principles should influence how physicians conduct informed consent discussions and advise patients about preferred therapies. For informed consent, the physician has the responsibility for presenting treatment options and the pros and cons of each alternative, may need to inquire into the patient's values to identify important preferences, and should discuss the likelihood of survival, MI, stroke, repeat revascularization procedures, and QoL associated with the treatment options, including personalized estimates based on symptoms and comorbidities. When treatment options carry similar risks of death and MI, physicians should explain that for some but not all patients QoL is most improved by PCI or CABG in the most symptomatic patients, and least improved with revascularization in patients who are asymptomatic or only mildly symptomatic; when survival is similar among strategies, patients usually base decisions on their perceptions of how each strategy affects QoL, and given a choice, most patients prefer a strategy that is easier in the short-term (e.g. PCI) over one that is more complicated (e.g. CABG) even when the latter produces better long-term results, so called temporal discounting, so the physician should make patients aware of the trade-offs they are considering. Patients and physicians frequently over-estimate the benefit of revascularization procedures compared with noninvasive medical therapies.

Psychological interventions after coronary revascularization — In patients who have undergone coronary revascularization who have symptoms of depression, anxiety, or stress, treatment with cognitive behavioral therapy, psychological counseling, and/or pharmacological interventions is beneficial to improve quality of life and cardiac outcomes; in patients who have undergone coronary revascularization, it may be reasonable to screen for depression and refer or treat when it is indicated to improve quality of life and recovery. Presurgery estimates of depression in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) range from 14% to 43%, and about 20% of patients who undergo CABG remain depressed postoperatively. In the EsDEPACS trial, escitalopram was superior to placebo in reducing depression during the 24-week trial, and long-term follow-up showed that escitalopram resulted in a significantly lower risk of MACE and MI but not death; in ENRICHD, therapy was associated with improved depression but not event-free survival after 24 months of follow-up, with a subgroup analysis finding a 42% lower risk of death or MI in patients treated with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor. The Bypassing the Blues trial randomized depressed patients undergoing CABG to 8 months of collaborative care or usual care and demonstrated a 50% reduction in depression scores and improved quality of life in the collaborative care group, and a meta-analysis of these trials reported a reduction in cardiovascular deaths but not overall deaths, MI, or revascularization with psychological interventions. In the CODIACS-QoL trial evaluating 1500 patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) without a history of depression, universal depression screening with clinician notification did not alter quality of life, depression-free days, depressive symptoms, mortality rate, or patient-reported harms in patients with ACS.

Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and quality of life (QoL) — subgroup findings and prior surgery context: In the SYNTAX trial, subgroups defined by age (< 75-year old versus > 75-year old) had differences between PCI and CABG in the SAQ angina frequency subscale at 6 or 12 months; there was no interaction between age and angina status. In diabetes, the BARI 2D trial showed improvement in angina with PCI compared with medical therapy, but otherwise similar QoL measurements, and the SYNTAX trial did not demonstrate significant differences in QoL scores for CABG versus PCI-treated diabetic patients. In patients with recurrent ischemia following CABG, PCI of the native vessel or bypass graft significantly improved angina compared with baseline. Data regarding QoL after PCI in patients with chronic kidney disease or congestive heart failure is lacking.

ACC/AHA/SCAI coronary revascularization guideline — adding coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) during other cardiac surgery (including aortic valve replacement [AVR]): "Age does not appear to be a prohibitive risk factor" for patients "between the ages of 75 and 84 years", but "risk increases in patients ≥ 85 years of age"; many studies define coronary artery disease (CAD) as "at least 1 vessel with stenosis ≥ 50%, thus including both intermediate and significant CAD", and "Limited data are available" for intermediate CAD "(stenosis, 40%–69%)", for whom "Patients with intermediate CAD may benefit from physiological testing with iFR or FFR to guide decision-making". In AVR cohorts, significant CAD was defined as " ≥ 70% stenosis of any major epicardial coronary vessel, including side branches, or ≥ 50% stenosis of the left main", and concomitant CABG was "associated with a reduced late all-cause mortality rate (hazard ratio, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.49–0.79; P < 0.001)", whereas "A large study of 6151 patients" with extensive CAD "(> 50% left main stenosis or ≥ 3 diseased vessels)" undergoing AVR with CABG had "more perioperative morbidity, but not mortality", and "A large study that propensity-matched" AVR versus AVR with CABG "demonstrated no differences in morbidity or mortality between groups".

### Perioperative statin therapy for patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting [^115CtoTX]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Coronary artery bypass grafting is associated with an intense systemic inflammatory response, which is linked to postoperative complications. Beyond lipid lowering, statins exert a constellation of beneficial actions, including an antiinflammatory role, known as pleiotropic effects. There is increasing evidence that perioperative statin therapy improves outcomes in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting. Statins are underused in the coronary artery bypass grafting population, because perioperative discontinuation remains a common practice. This article provides an extensive review of the available literature on the effect of perioperative statin therapy on post–coronary artery bypass grafting outcomes and weighs the evidence for the concerns about increased incidence of statin-related adverse effects in this setting.

### Rationale and design of the coronary artery bypass grafting surgery off or on pump revascularization study: a large international randomized trial in cardiac surgery [^111YgxEQ]. American Heart Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Uncertainty remains regarding the benefits and risks of the technique of operating on a beating heart (off pump) for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery versus on-pump CABG. Prior trials had few events and relatively short follow-up. There is a need for a large randomized, controlled trial with long-term follow-up to inform both the short- and long-term impact of the 2 approaches to CABG.

Methods

We plan to randomize 4,700 patients in whom CABG is planned to undergo the procedure on pump or off pump. The coprimary outcomes are a composite of total mortality, myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, and renal failure at 30 days and a composite of total mortality, MI, stroke, renal failure, and repeat revascularization at 5 years. We will also undertake a cost-effectiveness analysis at 30 days and 5 years after CABG surgery. Other outcomes include neurocognitive dysfunction, recurrence of angina, cardiovascular mortality, blood transfusions, and quality of life.

Results

As of May 3, 2011, CORONARY has recruited > 3,884 patients from 79 centers in 19 countries. Currently, patient's mean age is 67.6 years, 80.7% are men, 47.0% have a history of diabetes, 51.4% have a history of smoking, and 34.4% had a previous MI. In addition, 20.9% of patients have a left main disease, and 96.6% have double or triple vessel disease.

Conclusions

CORONARY is the largest trial yet conducted comparing off-pump CABG to on-pump CABG. Its results will lead to a better understanding of the safety and efficacy of off-pump CABG.

### Quality of life after coronary artery bypass graft: results from the POST CABG trial [^117CfEJ1]. Chest (2004). Low credibility.

Objectives

The POST CABG (Post Coronary Artery Bypass Graft) Trial showed that aggressive lowering of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels reduced the progression of atherosclerosis in saphenous vein grafts. In the extended follow-up phase, aggressive lowering of LDL cholesterol levels was associated with reduced rates of clinical events. Low-dose anticoagulation therapy did not reduce the progression of atherosclerosis. We conducted this analysis to determine the effects of both lipid-lowering and low-dose anticoagulation therapy on health-related quality of life (HRQL).

Design

Randomized clinical trial, factorial design.

Setting

Outpatients in five tertiary care medical centers.

Patients

A cohort of 852 patients enrolled in the POST CABG Trial completed an HRQL questionnaire at baseline, and at the year 2 and year 4 follow-up visits.

Intervention

Aggressive LDL cholesterol lowering vs moderate LDL cholesterol lowering, and low-dose warfarin vs placebo.

Measurements

Domains included emotional status, basic physical and social functioning, perceived health status, symptoms of pain, a variety of physical symptoms, and global life satisfaction.

Results

Overall, there were no indications of systematic differences among treatment groups for any of the HRQL parameters at baseline, year 2, or year 4.

Conclusions

These data indicate that patients did not experience detrimental or beneficial effects on HRQL parameters while receiving LDL cholesterol-lowering therapy that had demonstrable benefits for treatment of atherosclerosis.

### Non-invasive versus invasive management in patients with prior coronary artery bypass surgery with a non-ST segment elevation acute coronary syndrome: study design of the pilot randomised controlled trial and registry (CABG-ACS) [^113WSrYz]. Open Heart (2016). Low credibility.

Accordingly, all invasive coronary interventional procedures will be reported:
Elective;
Non-elective unplanned (as adjudicated by the CEC).

Health economics: Quality of life, direct healthcare costs, adverse events and their economic consequences over a patient's lifetime are key considerations to inform whether or not a routine conservative approach would be acceptable in patients with NSTE-ACS with prior CABG. At this stage, we are uncertain of the potential longer term economic value of routine conservative management. A preliminary economic model will be designed to provide an estimate of the lifetime incremental costs, effects and net monetary benefit of a conservative treatment approach in patients with CABG-ACS. The model will synthesise future data from the pilot trial and the literature (eg, TACTICS CABG analysis).

Second, we are also uncertain on the optimal design of the future trial, including whether health economic results should be the primary objective. Value of information analyses will illustrate where additional information in a future trial will have the most value in increasing confidence in net monetary benefit. Such information will provide evidence for the optimal design of a future trial, including considerations of, but not limited to: whether it is needed, sample size, length of follow-up and relevant economic outcomes.

Pilot: We aim to prospectively gather information on the overall feasibility of conducting a clinical trial of routine non-invasive versus routine invasive management in recently hospitalised patients with an acute NSTE-ACS and prior CABG. The aim of the pilot is to mimic the main trial and assess whether or not random allocation of these treatment strategies and compliance with the protocol is feasible. Clinical research nurses will support enrolment and follow-up assessments on two of the four sites. NHS clinicians will support enrolment and follow-up assessments on all of the sites. We specifically aim to gather information on screening, recruitment, randomisation (to medical therapy or invasive management), cross-over rates and serious adverse events in patients with prior CABG and a recent NSTE-ACS to inform the feasibility and design of a future definitive clinical trial. Researchers and nurses independent of the clinical team will conduct follow-up for adverse events.

Consent: All randomised and registry patients will provide written informed consent as soon as feasible after hospital admission and prior to referral for coronary angiography. Patients will be given an information sheet prior, and may opt out at any time.

### Quality of life after percutaneous coronary intervention versus coronary artery bypass grafting [^113UBPS6]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Limitations

The results of the present meta‐analysis must be interpreted within the context of common limitations in procedural randomized trials, including lack of blinding, rigorous inclusion/exclusion criteria that may limit generalizability, loss to follow‐up for QoL outcomes, and the potential expertise of participating centers. Moreover, it is noteworthy that "immortal time" bias could be present because QoL questionnaires can be completed only by participants who are alive and free of major impairments that would prevent their completion. This also applies to patients who have had a major cerebrovascular event, such as stroke, which would prevent completion of follow‐up questionnaires. Overall, the proportion of participants who completed baseline to follow‐up data at 1 year was 80%.

In addition, we did not have patient‐level data from these studies to adjust for patient‐level characteristics more rigorously and to explore potential heterogeneity of relative treatment benefits by these factors or to conduct responder analyses to help interpret the mean differences between groups throughout follow‐up or to jointly model the potential impact of death. In trials where deaths favor 1 group, the patients who die are more likely to have worse health status; thus there are benefits of jointly modeling the outcomes so as not to underestimate the benefits of a treatment that improves survival. Given the similar mortality after PCI and CABG at 12 months from most RCTs, this was likely not of major consequence to the present study at this time point but may have affected later outcomes in patients with extensive (non‐left main‐related) CAD in whom survival favors CABG. We were also not able to evaluate longer‐term time points (eg, 10 years) due to the absence of studies including QoL data at this follow‐up duration. To provide an estimate beyond 1 year, we combined 36‐ and 60‐month assessments because there were not enough studies to perform a meta‐analysis at each individual time point. Finally, a significant limitation of the collective trial population was that it was predominantly white and male. Many studies did not report race or ethnicity, and those that did reported race and ethnicity consistent with country‐specific census categories. Additional detailed information on the impact of race and ethnicity on QOL outcomes was not available in the aggregate data of the included studies. This limits the generalizability of the study findings to the participants represented in the included studies.

### 2020 ACC / AHA guideline for the management of patients with valvular heart disease: executive summary: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^112DEHNR]. Circulation (2021). High credibility.

Management of coronary artery disease (CAD) in patients undergoing valve surgery — In patients with symptoms of angina, objective evidence of ischemia, decreased left ventricular (LV) systolic function, history of CAD, or coronary risk factors (including men > 40 years of age and postmenopausal women), invasive coronary angiography is indicated before valve intervention. In patients with chronic severe secondary mitral regurgitation (MR), invasive coronary angiography should be performed as part of the evaluation. In selected patients with a low to intermediate pretest probability of CAD, contrast-enhanced coronary computed tomography (CT) angiography is reasonable to exclude the presence of significant obstructive CAD. In patients undergoing valve repair or replacement with significant proximal CAD (≥ 70% reduction in luminal diameter in major coronary arteries or ≥ 50% reduction in luminal diameter in the left main coronary artery and/or physiologically significant), coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is reasonable for selective patients.

### Effect of percutaneous coronary intervention on quality of life: a consensus statement from the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions [^114zVZU6]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2013). Medium credibility.

Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) versus percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) — angina relief, return to work, and quality of life (QoL) outcomes are summarized. At 1 year, fewer patients reported angina with CABG compared with PCI across 6,528 patients in 10 randomized trials (14% versus 26%, P < 0.001). A systematic review of 23 randomized studies found angina relief at 1, 3, and 5 years was better for CABG; at 5 years, freedom from angina was 84% for CABG and 79% for PCI (P < 0.001). Return to work occurs earlier with PCI-treated patients compared with CABG, but at 3–5 months the rate is similar. Drug eluting stents (DES) compared with historic CABG controls were associated with better QoL at 1 year and similar QoL at 3 year follow-up. In the SYNTAX trial, CABG showed a small but significant reduction in angina frequency compared with DES at 6 and 12 months among those with frequent baseline angina, but not in those with less frequent symptoms. With long-term follow-up (e.g., > 5 years), differences in angina-free status between PCI and CABG tend to decrease. In left main or single vessel proximal left anterior descending artery disease, PCI (compared with CABG) produced similar QoL at 6–12 months but more frequent angina at 5 years.

### Quality-of-life outcomes with coronary artery bypass graft surgery in ischemic left ventricular dysfunction: a randomized trial [^115fpTP4]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The STICH (Surgical Treatment for Ischemic Heart Failure) trial compared a strategy of routine coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) with guideline-based medical therapy for patients with ischemic left ventricular dysfunction.

Objective

To describe treatment-related quality-of-life (QOL) outcomes, a major prespecified secondary end point in the STICH trial.

Design

Randomized trial. (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00023595).

Setting

99 clinical sites in 22 countries.

Patients

1212 patients with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 0.35 or less and coronary artery disease.

Intervention

Random assignment to medical therapy alone (602 patients) or medical therapy plus CABG (610 patients).

Measurements

A battery of QOL instruments at baseline (98.9% complete) and 4, 12, 24, and 36 months after randomization (collection rates were 80% to 89% of those eligible). The principal prespecified QOL measure was the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire, which assesses the effect of heart failure on patients' symptoms, physical function, social limitations, and QOL.

Results

The Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire overall summary score was consistently higher (more favorable) in the CABG group than in the medical therapy group by 4.4 points (95% CI, 1.8 to 7.0 points) at 4 months, 5.8 points (CI, 3.1 to 8.6 points) at 12 months, 4.1 points (CI, 1.2 to 7.1 points) at 24 months, and 3.2 points (CI, 0.2 to 6.3 points) at 36 months. Sensitivity analyses to account for the effect of mortality on follow-up QOL measurement were consistent with the primary findings.

Limitation

Therapy was not masked.

Conclusion

In this cohort of symptomatic high-risk patients with ischemic left ventricular dysfunction and multivessel coronary artery disease, CABG plus medical therapy produced clinically important improvements in quality of life compared with medical therapy alone over 36 months.

### Perioperative management of antithrombotic therapy: an American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guideline [^115Vaudj]. Chest (2022). High credibility.

CABG surgery — postoperative antiplatelet resumption and caveat: In patients receiving ASA (aspirin) or a P2Y12 inhibitor who are undergoing CABG surgery, we suggest resuming the ASA or P2Y12 inhibitor within 24 hours after surgery compared to ≥ 24 hours after surgery. Resumption of antiplatelet therapy may be delayed in patients who develop post-CABG thrombocytopenia.

### Care guided by tissue oxygenation and haemodynamic monitoring in off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (bottomline-CS): assessor blind, single centre, randomised controlled trial [^115Qxara]. BMJ (2025). Excellent credibility.

The study Bottomline-CS was published by Jiange Han and colleagues in 2025 in the journal BMJ. This study is related to the following diseases: Coronary artery disease and Coronary artery bypass graft. In the Bottomline-CS study, the trial question was: what is the effect of multisite tissue oxygenation-guided care in patients who were scheduled for elective off-pump CABG? In the Bottomline-CS study, the study design was: single center, open label, RCT. In the Bottomline-CS study, the population was: 1941 patients (580 female, 1361 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients, aged ≥ 60 years, who were scheduled for elective off-pump CABG. The key exclusion criteria were preoperative dependence on respiratory support; use of an external cardiac assist device; urgent or emergent surgery; life expectancy ≤ 30 days. In the Bottomline-CS study, the interventions were: n = 967 guided care (multisite monitoring of tissue oxygen saturation by use of near-infrared spectroscopy and hemodynamic monitoring) n = 974 usual care (standard perioperative care managed by clinical staff). In the Bottomline-CS study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in postoperative complications at day 30 (47.3% vs. 47.8%; RR 0.99, 99% CI 0.9 to 1.08). In the Bottomline-CS study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in cerebral complications (32.2% vs. 31.7%; RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.15) No significant difference in cardiac complications (9.4% vs. 8.4%; RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.49) No significant difference in AF (30.3% vs. 30.3%; RR 1, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.15). In the Bottomline-CS study, the conclusion was: in adult patients, aged ≥ 60 years, who were scheduled for elective off-pump CABG, guided care was not superior to usual care with respect to postoperative complications at day 30.

### Impact of perioperative glycemic control strategy on patient survival after coronary bypass surgery [^1142r9u8]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Glycemic control in the perioperative period decreases mortality and morbidity, but data are scarce with regard to the effects of glucose control approaches on survival. We assessed long-term survival in patients treated with 2 strategies of glucose control after first-time isolated coronary artery bypass graft.

Methods

In a previously published trial, patients were prospectively randomized to strict (90–120 mg/dL) or liberal (121–180 mg/dL) glucose control protocols. The aim of this study was to assess long-term data on survival and health-related quality of life based on the original prospective randomized study population.

Results

No differences were found in cumulative survival between the strict (95.5%) and liberal (93.5%) target range groups (log-rank = 0.32, p = 0.57) over a mean follow-up of 40.0 ± 4.4 months. Physical health-related quality of life significantly improved in all patients from baseline to 6 months after surgery (F = 17.73, p < 0.001), and there were no differences in improvement of health-related quality of life between the 2 target range groups (F = 0.15, p = 0.70).

Conclusions

These results support our previous findings and indicate that a liberal glycemic control strategy after coronary artery bypass leads to survival rates and improvements in health-related quality of life that are similar to those achieved with a strict target range. In addition, the liberal strategy is superior in glucose control and target range management.

### Concomitant atrial fibrillation ablation in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass and cardiac valve surgery [^111Use3q]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Surgical ablation of atrial fibrillation (AF) in conjunction with other cardiac surgery is now a class I guideline recommendation. Multiple studies have demonstrated that the concomitant surgical ablation of AF can be performed safely and effectively during valve and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) resulting in a return to sinus rhythm postoperatively and improved long-term results. However, the surgical ablation of AF at the time of other cardiac surgery is performed less often than it should be, especially in patients undergoing CABG and aortic valve surgery. Randomized-controlled trials designed to determine the effect of treating AF concomitantly with other cardiac surgical procedures have lacked long-term follow up, but multiple, large observational studies have demonstrated an improved quality of life, a decrease in long-term strokes, and improved late survival in patients who undergo AF ablation. However, the potential survival benefit of concomitant AF ablation was not addressed by either the Society of Thoracic Surgery or American Association for Thoracic Surgery guideline committees. Left atrial appendage closure is an important part of the surgical ablation of AF as it significantly reduces the long-term risk of stroke following cardiac surgery and improves the success of AF treatment. In this study, we update the electrophysiology and surgical community on the recommended surgical techniques for AF ablation and its effect on perioperative morbidity, perioperative mortality, as well as its long-term effects on stroke, quality of life, and survival.

### Perioperative use of cardiac medical therapy among patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery: a systematic review [^115neaFj]. American Heart Journal (2007). Low credibility.

Background

The use of perioperative cardiac medical therapy among patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) has not been closely examined.

Objectives

The objective of this study was to systematically review the medical literature examining the effects of perioperative cardiac medical therapy on clinical outcomes among patients undergoing CABG.

Methods

Using the Medline database and online clinical trial databases, we reviewed all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies examining the effect of perioperative angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, antilipid agents (including statins), aspirin, beta-blockers, and calcium-channel blockers on clinical outcomes.

Results

Our review identified 27 studies (6 RCTs, 21 observational studies), involving > 700,000 patients, that examined the impact of perioperative medical therapy on clinical outcomes after CABG. Although studies provide conflicting results, the literature suggests that perioperative aspirin use may decrease inhospital mortality and myocardial infarction, whereas perioperative angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor use does not appear to be beneficial. Perioperative statin use reduces all-cause mortality at 30 days and cardiac death at 60 days and 1 year post-CABG but does not appear to reduce myocardial infarction or congestive heart failure rates. Multiple studies have demonstrated that pre- and postoperative beta-blockers are associated with a decrease in atrial fibrillation. In addition, beta-blockers may reduce inhospital and 30-day mortality, although these results are not consistent across all studies. Calcium-channel blockers do not appear to improve inhospital or 30-day mortality. No studies examined the perioperative use of angiotensin II receptor blockers or nonstatin antilipid agents among CABG patients.

Conclusions

The perioperative use of cardiac medical therapy among CABG patients remains understudied. Given their proven benefits among patients with cardiovascular disease and their potential to improve outcomes among CABG patients, further studies, particularly large RCTs, are needed.

### Perioperative care based on roy adaptation model in elderly patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia: impact on psychological well-being, pain, and quality of life [^112PFfmQ]. BMC Urology (2023). Medium credibility.

Regarding postoperative pain management, our study supports previous research highlighting the benefits of RAM-based interventions. RAM considers various adaptive modes that influence people's responses to pain, making it applicable in pain management. Additionally, a scoping review on chronic pain and adaptation processes in older adults with persistent pain concluded that RAM is appropriate for explaining these processes and is more applicable in clinical practice. Our study demonstrated a significant decrease in pain intensity in elderly BPH patients who received the RAM intervention, further emphasizing the relevance of RAM-based perioperative care in optimizing pain control.

In terms of HRQoL, our findings are consistent with studies that explored the impact of RAM-based interventions on various domains of HRQoL. For example, nursing interventions based on RAM have been shown to enhance self-efficacy, self-management, healthy behavior changes, medication compliance, and blood pressure control in elderly hypertensive patients, resulting in improved HRQoL. Esmaili, M et al. conducted a study on the effects of RAM-based perioperative care on HRQoL in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery and reported decreases in fatigue levels and improvements in HRQoL. Similarly, our study demonstrated significant improvements in SF-36 parameters among elderly BPH patients who received the RAM intervention. These findings underscore the positive impact of RAM-based perioperative care on overall well-being and HRQoL outcomes.

While prior research has explored RAM-based interventions across diverse patient populations and surgical contexts, its application specifically in elderly BPH patients requires further investigation. Subsequent studies should compare outcomes of RAM-based perioperative care with established models in similar surgical interventions for elderly BPH patients, enhancing understanding of RAM's unique benefits in this demographic. Additionally, assessing the long-term effects of RAM-based perioperative care, beyond our study's scope, is crucial. Examining patient outcomes and quality of life measures, like six months or one-year post-surgery, can reveal sustained benefits and impacts on long-term recovery and well-being in elderly BPH patients. Despite the promising results favoring RAM-based care, adopting a new patient management strategy necessitates careful consideration. Factors such as potential additional time demands on healthcare professionals, training requirements, and adjustments in resource allocation should be meticulously weighed. A comprehensive cost-benefit analysis is essential to evaluate the economic implications of transitioning to RAM-based care. While our study underscores positive outcomes, practical feasibility and sustainability in real-world clinical settings demand thorough evaluation.

### ACCF / SCAI / STS / AATS / AHA / ASNC / HFSA / SCCT 2012 appropriate use criteria for coronary revascularization focused update: a report of the American college of cardiology foundation appropriate use criteria task force, Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions, Society of Thoracic Surgeons, American Association for Thoracic Surgery, American Heart Association, American Society of Nuclear Cardiology, and the Society of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography [^116ZkrGM]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

The American College of Cardiology Foundation (ACCF), Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions, Society of Thoracic Surgeons, and the American Association for Thoracic Surgery, along with key specialty and subspecialty societies, conducted an update of the appropriate use criteria (AUC) for coronary revascularization frequently considered. In the initial document, 180 clinical scenarios were developed to mimic patient presentations encountered in everyday practice and included information on symptom status, extent of medical therapy, risk level as assessed by noninvasive testing, and coronary anatomy. This update provides a reassessment of clinical scenarios the writing group felt to be affected by significant changes in the medical literature or gaps from prior criteria. The methodology used in this update is similar to the initial document, and the definition of appropriateness was unchanged. The technical panel scored the clinical scenarios on a scale of 1 to 9. Scores of 7 to 9 indicate that revascularization is considered appropriate and likely to improve patients' health outcomes or survival. Scores of 1 to 3 indicate revascularization is considered inappropriate and unlikely to improve health outcomes or survival. Scores in the mid-range (4 to 6) indicate a clinical scenario for which the likelihood that coronary revascularization will improve health outcomes or survival is uncertain. In general, as seen with the prior AUC, the use of coronary revascularization for patients with acute coronary syndromes and combinations of significant symptoms and/or ischemia is appropriate. In contrast, revascularization of asymptomatic patients or patients with low-risk findings on noninvasive testing and minimal medical therapy are viewed less favorably. The technical panel felt that based on recent studies, coronary artery bypass grafting remains an appropriate method of revascularization for patients with high burden of coronary artery disease (CAD). Additionally, percutaneous coronary intervention may have a role in revascularization of patients with high burden of CAD. The primary objective of the appropriate use criteria is to improve physician decision making and patient education regarding expected benefits from revascularization and to guide future research.

### The effect of postoperative complications on health-related quality of life and survival 12 years after coronary artery bypass grafting-a prospective cohort study [^114B6kFj]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Despite of ongoing decline 12 years after CABG surgery, both patients with and without complications showed steady improvements in their health-related QoL when compared with the preoperative scores. However, the patients with complications and especially with MACCE had lower postoperative QoL at 1 year and 12 years after the surgery. Due to far-reaching impact of postoperative complications on patients QoL status, a special focus should be directed towards complication prevention and intensive rehabilitation of patients with postoperative complications after CABG surgery.

### Perioperative use of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors and outcomes in patients undergoing cardiac surgery [^114o46qX]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

In the early 2000s, two large-randomized clinical trials, the Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation (HOPE) trialand the European Trial on Reduction of Cardiac Events with Perindopril in Stable Coronary Artery Disease, showed that in patients with risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) but without heart failure, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors) resulted in a relative risk (RR) reduction of about 20% in mortality, MI, and stroke in 4–5 years follow-up. The effects were independent of age, gender, concomitant diseases, or therapy. Thus far, multiple clinical trials and cohort studies have demonstrated that ACE inhibitors are beneficial to patients with hypertension, diabetes, renal disease, heart dysfunction, also to patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), and valve diseases –.

Meanwhile, despite accumulating evidence that ACE inhibitors are effective drugs in a broad range of patients with risk of CVD and increasing numbers of patients are treated with ACE inhibitors prior to cardiac surgery, whether or not ACE inhibitors should be continued or given perioperatively remains controversial. Results from previous clinical studies are conflicting and raise more questions than answers –. The Guidelines (2011) for coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) from the American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology stated that it is uncertain about the safety of the preoperative administration of ACE inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) in patients on chronic therapy and the safety of initiating ACE inhibitors or ARBs before hospital discharge. In the updated 2014 ESC/EACTS Guidelines, they state that ACE inhibitors might be stopped 1–2 days before CABG to avoid the potential deleterious consequences of perioperative hypotension. Thus, there is a need to investigate the safety and effectiveness of preoperative and postoperative RASi therapy in large cardiovascular cohorts.

In this study, we examined both preoperative and postoperative (or perioperative) use of RASi, including ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and direct renin inhibitors, on outcomes of patients undergoing CABG and/or valve surgery. The results show that perioperative use of RASi has a significant benefit for the postoperative and long-term survival among patients undergoing CABG and/or valve surgery.

### A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study to evaluate the cardioprotective effects of MC-1 in patients undergoing high-risk coronary artery bypass graft surgery: MC-1 to eliminate necrosis and damage in coronary artery bypass graft surgery trial (MEND-CABG) II – study design and rationale [^111d9V8J]. American Heart Journal (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery is effective in relieving angina and improving survival and quality of life in patients with obstructive coronary artery disease; however, recurrent angina, myocardial infarction, neurological injury, and death can occur in the perioperative and postoperative period. MC-1 (pyridoxal 5'-phosphate) is a novel agent that has shown promise in reducing myocardial necrosis by reducing cellular calcium overload after percutaneous coronary intervention and CABG surgery in high-risk patients undergoing these procedures.

Methods

MEND-CABG II is a phase III study evaluating the efficacy and safety of MC-1 in reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality after CABG. High-risk patients undergoing CABG surgery will be randomly assigned to receive either MC-1 (250 mg/d) or matching placebo immediately before and continuing for 30 days after the procedure. The primary end point is the occurrence of cardiovascular death or nonfatal myocardial infarction through postoperative day 30. A total of 3023 patients were enrolled at 130 sites in Canada, the United States, and Germany between October 2006 and September 2007, with results anticipated shortly after completion of 90-day follow-up in March 2008.

Conclusions

The data from the MEND-CABG II trial will establish whether peri- and postoperative treatment with MC-1 can decrease the short- and intermediate-term morbidity and mortality of high-risk patients undergoing CABG surgery.

### Six-month outcomes after high-risk coronary artery bypass graft surgery and preoperative intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation use: an inception cohort study [^112qioLC]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To inform the design of a pivotal randomized controlled trial of prophylactic intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation (IABC) in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) at high risk of postoperative low cardiac output syndrome (LCOS).

Design

Inception cohort study.

Setting

A total of 13 established cardiac centers in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom.

Participants

Adult patients were eligible for inclusion if they were listed for CABG surgery and had 2 or more LCOS risk factors (low ejection fraction, severe left main coronary artery disease, redo sternotomy, unstable angina).

Interventions

Outcomes of interest were a composite outcome of in-hospital mortality, postoperative acute myocardial infarction (AMI), acute kidney injury (AKI), or stroke as well as 6-month vital status and quality of life using the EuroQol 5-dimensional questionnaire (EQ5D).

Measurements and Main Results

The study included 136 participants over a 29-month period. Overall, in-hospital and 6-month mortality occurred in 7 (5%) and 11 (8%) participants, respectively. The composite outcome occurred in 60 (44%). The mean increase in EQ5D summary index at 6 months was 0.10 (standard deviation 0.24, p = 0.01). Perioperative AMI, AKI, or stroke significantly decreased the odds of a clinically meaningful improvement in quality of life (odds ratio 0.32; 95% confidence interval 0.13–0.79; p = 0.014). Preoperative IABC was used in 39 participants and did not predict postoperative outcomes.

Conclusions

The study identified a group of patients at risk of LCOS in whom CABG surgery was associated with a substantial burden of perioperative morbidity. Preoperative IABC use was variable, supporting the need for further research.

### Neuropsychologic and quality-of-life outcomes after coronary artery bypass surgery with and without cardiopulmonary bypass: a prospective randomized trial [^1168nhvF]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

The objective of this study was to compare neuropsychologic and quality-of-life outcomes of patients undergoing off-pump coronary artery bypass surgery to those undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery using conventional cardiopulmonary bypass.

Design

A prospective randomized trial of coronary artery bypass graft surgery with and without the use of cardiopulmonary bypass.

Setting

A cardiothoracic surgery unit at a tertiary hospital.

Participants

Sixty-six patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery and a control group of 50 participants not undergoing cardiac surgery.

Interventions

Patients were randomized to receive coronary artery bypass graft surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass or randomized to coronary artery bypass graft surgery without the use of cardiopulmonary bypass.

Measurements and Main Results

The proportions of neuropsychologic deficits and improvement in quality-of-life were comparable regardless of whether patients were randomized to receive off-pump coronary artery bypass graft surgery or conventional coronary artery graft surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass.

Conclusions

Patients receiving coronary artery bypass grafts without cardiopulmonary bypass did not show fewer cognitive deficits or greater improvement in quality of life.

### Impact of perioperative dexmedetomidine on long-term outcomes in older patients following cardiac surgery: follow-up of a randomized trial [^112JUjsW]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

MACE are important reasons that lead to death or poor quality of life after cardiac surgery. According to available studies, the incidence of MACE ranged from 6.6% to 12.2% at 1 year and from 13.4% to 29.9% at 5 to 6 years after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery. In the present study, most of our patients (85.3%) underwent CABG surgery. MACE occurred in 10.0% of our placebo patients within 5 years, roughly within the reported ranges. We also did not find significant differences in MACE-free survival nor hospital-free survival between the two groups. But again, considering the limited number of endpoint events, more studies are required in these aspects. As can be expected, the cognitive function as assessed with the TICS-m and quality of life as assessed with the SF-36 were similar between groups in long-term survivors. In line with our results, a small sample size trial of 70 patients also reported that dexmedetomidine compared with propofol for ICU sedation did not improve quality of life (measured with SF-36) in older patients at 6 months after cardiac surgery.

This study was based on a rigorously conducted randomized trial; the subsequent long-term follow-up was performed in a double-blind way. Our results thus provide evidence of high quality. There are some limitations. Firstly, sample size of the underlying trial was estimated to detect difference in postoperative delirium rather than long-term outcomes. This follow-up study was underpowered to detect differences in overall, MACE-free, and hospital-free survivals. Secondly, 14.4% of our patients were lost during the long follow-up period; this may produce bias although the proportions of lost to follow-up were comparable in each group.

In summary, our long-term follow up study found that perioperative dexmedetomidine did not improve overall and MACE-free survivals among older patients after elective cardiac surgery. However, our results were underpowered considering the limited sample size and non-negligible loss to follow-up rate. Well-designed large sample size studies are needed to further clarify the impacts of dexmedetomidine on long-term outcomes in this patient population.
