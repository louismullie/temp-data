## Question

Lipid management guideline

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about lipid management guidelines. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overarching principles that unify guidelines across societies. Then, I should verify screening and risk assessment strategies, including when to use risk calculators and imaging. Next, I will examine lifestyle-first management, followed by statin intensity selection and monitoring. After that, I need to check thresholds versus targets for LDL-C and when to add nonstatin therapy. I will then review triglyceride management, special populations, and implementation barriers, and finally synthesize a practical algorithm and conclude with key takeaways, ensuring each step is supported by current high-credibility sources.

> Let me first confirm the unifying principles that anchor modern lipid management across ACC/AHA, ESC/EAS, CCS, and NLA guidance, because if I get these wrong, downstream decisions will drift. The core consensus is that LDL-C is causally linked to atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, that treatment intensity should scale with absolute ASCVD risk, and that statins remain first-line therapy with shared decision-making guiding initiation and intensification, especially in primary prevention scenarios [^1138QxsW] [^112XZmJJ] [^115Uzs9s].

> Wait, let me verify screening and risk assessment details before jumping to treatment. Nonfasting lipid profiles are acceptable for most adults, with fasting reserved for specific indications like confirming hypertriglyceridemia or before initiating icosapent ethyl, and adults 20 years and older should have a baseline lipid panel to estimate ASCVD risk and document LDL-C, repeating periodically based on age and risk status [^116nDcCL] [^114mpP3Y]. I should double-check risk calculators: ACC/AHA uses the Pooled Cohort Equations, ESC/EAS uses SCORE2, and newer tools like PREVENT incorporate broader risk factors; risk-enhancing factors such as premature ASCVD family history, inflammatory conditions, South Asian ancestry, and chronic kidney disease can reclassify patients and should prompt more aggressive therapy discussions [^1138QxsW] [^115irgM5] [^114aykkg]. Hold on, I should verify imaging use: coronary artery calcium scoring is reasonable in borderline- or intermediate-risk adults to refine risk and guide statin decisions, and Lp(a) and ApoB are increasingly emphasized as risk enhancers, with some societies advocating broader Lp(a) screening given its prevalence and prognostic value [^1138QxsW] [^111kMrWN].

> Next, I should review lifestyle therapy because it is foundational across all guidelines and often underimplemented. Emphasis on a heart-healthy dietary pattern, regular physical activity, weight management, and smoking cessation should precede or accompany pharmacotherapy, and these measures are particularly important in younger adults where lifetime risk is shaped by early risk exposure and in those with borderline or intermediate 10-year risk where lifestyle can meaningfully shift risk trajectories [^1138QxsW] [^115Uzs9s] [^113KUVQc].

> I will now examine statin intensity selection, and I need to ensure I align with both percentage LDL-C reduction goals and absolute risk categories. For secondary prevention or very high-risk primary prevention, high-intensity statins are indicated to achieve at least a 50% LDL-C reduction when tolerated, with moderate-intensity statins as the fallback if high-intensity is not tolerated; for primary prevention, moderate-intensity statins are appropriate for intermediate risk, with high-intensity reserved for high-risk primary prevention or when multiple risk enhancers are present [^1138QxsW] [^114mpP3Y] [^1154wzMH]. Hold on, I should verify age nuances: in adults older than 75 years, moderate-intensity statins are generally favored for secondary prevention unless the patient is robust and high-intensity is well tolerated, reinforcing individualized decision-making in the elderly [^112ctU9U].

> Let me think about monitoring and follow-up, because timing matters for adherence and safety. Lipid panels should be checked about 4–12 weeks after initiating or changing therapy to assess response and adherence, then every 3–12 months once stable, with nonfasting samples acceptable for routine monitoring; I should confirm that fasting is reserved for specific scenarios like verifying hypertriglyceridemia or before icosapent ethyl initiation [^111EoPEv] [^114vKiZW] [^116nDcCL]. But wait, what if the patient is on a stable regimen for years — do we still need frequent checks? The NLA supports periodic reassessment rather than frequent testing when stable, aligning with pragmatic, patient-centered care [^114vKiZW].

> Now, I should clarify the threshold-versus-target debate, because this is where guidelines diverge and misinterpretation is common. ACC/AHA uses treatment thresholds to trigger addition of nonstatin therapy, whereas ESC/EAS and CCS favor explicit LDL-C targets; however, both approaches converge on the principle of more aggressive LDL-C lowering for higher-risk patients, and the practical effect is similar when clinicians intensify therapy if LDL-C remains above 70 mg/dL in very high-risk patients or above 55 mg/dL in those with recurrent events or familial hypercholesterolemia with ASCVD [^1138QxsW] [^112XZmJJ] [^116GYDVx]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost said "treat-to-target is superior", but I should correct that: while treat-to-target frameworks are widely used, the highest-quality evidence base for statins and nonstatins comes from trials using fixed doses rather than randomized-to-target designs, so both threshold and target approaches are acceptable if applied consistently within a risk-based framework [^1138QxsW] [^113C6sUg].

> I need to check when to add nonstatin therapy and in what sequence. If LDL-C remains 70 mg/dL or higher on maximally tolerated statin in very high-risk patients, ezetimibe should be added first, and if LDL-C remains 70 mg/dL or higher on statin plus ezetimibe, a PCSK9 inhibitor should be considered; bempedoic acid is a reasonable oral alternative for statin-intolerant patients or as an adjunct when further LDL-C lowering is needed, and inclisiran is an emerging option with twice-yearly dosing that aligns with the "lower for longer" principle [^1138QxsW] [^112SYNSK] [^1161rx8r]. Hold on, I should verify cost-effectiveness and shared decision-making here: given injection burden and cost, these additions require explicit discussion of absolute risk reduction, patient preferences, and access considerations [^112SYNSK].

> Let me consider triglyceride management, and I should confirm the role of statins even when TG is the primary abnormality. For patients with persistent triglycerides 150–499 mg/dL despite lifestyle therapy, statin therapy should be prioritized for ASCVD risk reduction, and if triglycerides remain 500 mg/dL or higher, the risk of pancreatitis rises and TG-lowering therapy such as icosapent ethyl, fibrates, or omega-3s can be layered onto statins; non-HDL-C or ApoB should guide atherogenic risk assessment when TG are elevated because calculated LDL-C may be inaccurate in hypertriglyceridemia [^115FnJCW] [^115v86mc]. I should double-check the evidence base: icosapent ethyl has outcome data in high-risk patients with persistent hypertriglyceridemia, whereas other TG-lowering agents have weaker or mixed outcome evidence, reinforcing statins as the cornerstone in mixed dyslipidemia [^115v86mc].

> Next, I should review special populations where standard algorithms may under- or overestimate risk. In familial hypercholesterolemia, treat aggressively with high-intensity statins and early combination therapy to achieve LDL-C less than 55 mg/dL if ASCVD is present, and consider cascade screening of relatives. In diabetes, obtain a lipid profile at diagnosis and at least annually, and treat with moderate- to high-intensity statins based on overall risk. In women of reproductive age, plan pre-pregnancy lipid optimization and avoid statins during pregnancy. In South Asian adults, consider earlier and more aggressive LDL-C lowering given elevated risk at lower traditional risk factor burdens. In patients with HIV, recognize HIV as a risk enhancer and consider statin therapy even for primary prevention given REPRIEVE data [^112XZmJJ] [^114wxZjj] [^114mpP3Y] [^114aykkg] [^115GcVcr]. Hold on, I should verify that these nuances are reflected in the cited guidance, and yes, each of these points is supported by contemporary society statements or trials [^112XZmJJ] [^114wxZjj] [^114aykkg] [^115GcVcr].

> I will now examine implementation barriers and practical solutions, because guideline-concordant care often fails at the point of uptake. Key gaps include underuse of statins, failure to intensify when LDL-C remains above threshold, and infrequent lipid monitoring. Multifaceted interventions such as clinician education, EMR prompts, team-based care, and patient-facing tools can improve LDL-C attainment and reduce variation, and health system initiatives like the AHA's national integrated ASCVD program aim to close these gaps through standardized workflows and quality metrics [^1167uBfE] [^111uQYrr] [^113tgunW]. Let me reconsider whether simpler, unified messaging helps: the NLA's "lower for longer" synthesis and simplified LDL-C targets by risk category are designed to reduce confusion and enhance consistent care delivery across settings [^115Uzs9s].

> Let me synthesize a practical clinical algorithm, and I should ensure it mirrors major guidelines while remaining actionable. Start with a nonfasting lipid panel and risk assessment using a validated calculator plus risk enhancers. Initiate lifestyle therapy for all and begin statin therapy based on risk category, favoring high-intensity regimens for secondary prevention and very high-risk primary prevention. Recheck lipids 4–12 weeks after changes and every 3–12 months when stable. If LDL-C remains above threshold in very high-risk patients, add ezetimibe and then a PCSK9 inhibitor as needed. For persistent hypertriglyceridemia, layer TG-specific therapy onto statins. Throughout, use shared decision-making to align treatment intensity with patient values, comorbidities, and access constraints [^1138QxsW] [^114mpP3Y] [^115Uzs9s]. I should double-check that this flow respects both threshold- and target-based frameworks, and it does by allowing clinicians to operationalize either approach while maintaining risk-proportional intensity of LDL-C lowering [^1138QxsW] [^116GYDVx].

> In conclusion, I need to ensure the key takeaways are explicit and evidence-aligned. LDL-C lowering reduces ASCVD events proportional to the absolute risk and the magnitude and duration of LDL-C reduction, statins remain first-line with intensity matched to risk, nonstatin therapies are layered when LDL-C thresholds or targets are not met, triglyceride management prioritizes statins for ASCVD risk while adding TG-specific therapy for high levels, and implementation science is essential to close the large gap between guidelines and practice. Anchoring care to "lower for longer" and risk-proportional therapy provides a coherent, patient-centered approach across diverse clinical scenarios [^1138QxsW] [^1167uBfE] [^115Uzs9s] [^112SYNSK].

Lipid management guidelines prioritize **LDL-C lowering** to reduce ASCVD risk, with statins as first-line therapy and treatment intensity based on risk category [^1138QxsW]. For very high-risk patients, target **LDL-C < 55 mg/dL** or a ≥ 50% reduction; for high-risk patients, < 70 mg/dL or a ≥ 50% reduction; and for moderate risk, < 100 mg/dL or a ≥ 30% reduction [^116GYDVx] [^1161rx8r]. Nonfasting lipid panels are acceptable, and monitoring is recommended 4–12 weeks after therapy changes, then every 3–12 months [^111EoPEv] [^114vKiZW]. Nonstatin therapies (ezetimibe, PCSK9 inhibitors) are added if LDL-C goals are not met or if patients are statin-intolerant [^112SYNSK] [^114sTAgR]. Lifestyle modifications are essential for all patients, and shared decision-making is emphasized for primary prevention [^1138QxsW].

---

## Risk stratification

Risk stratification guides therapy intensity and LDL-C targets; **very high risk** includes established ASCVD, recent ACS, or multiple severe risk factors, for which the LDL-C target is < 55 mg/dL or a ≥ 50% reduction [^112XZmJJ]. High risk includes severe hypercholesterolemia (LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL), diabetes with additional risk factors, or a single severe risk factor, with a target of < 70 mg/dL or a ≥ 50% reduction [^116GYDVx]. Moderate risk includes moderate hypercholesterolemia or multiple risk factors, with a target of < 100 mg/dL or a ≥ 30% reduction [^114mpP3Y].

---

## Lifestyle modifications

Lifestyle modifications are foundational for all patients, with **diet** emphasizing reduced saturated/trans fats, increased soluble fiber, and weight management [^notfound]. Physical activity of at least 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise is recommended, along with smoking cessation and moderation of alcohol intake [^notfound].

---

## Pharmacological therapy

### Statins

Statins are **first-line** therapy, with intensity tailored to risk:

| **Risk category** | **Recommended statin intensity** | **Ldl-c reduction goal** |
|-|-|-|
| Very high risk | High-intensity (e.g. atorvastatin 40–80 mg, rosuvastatin 20–40 mg) | ≥ 50% reduction [^111uQYrr] |
| High risk | High-intensity | ≥ 50% reduction [^114mpP3Y] |
| Moderate risk | Moderate-intensity (e.g. atorvastatin 10–20 mg, rosuvastatin 5–10 mg) | ≥ 30% reduction [^114mpP3Y] |

---

### Nonstatin therapies

Nonstatin therapies are added if **LDL-C goals are not met** with statins or if patients are statin-intolerant:

- **Ezetimibe**: Add if LDL-C remains ≥ 70 mg/dL in very high-risk patients or ≥ 100 mg/dL in high-risk patients [^111uQYrr].
- **PCSK9 inhibitors**: Consider if LDL-C remains ≥ 70 mg/dL despite statin + ezetimibe in very high-risk patients [^115NGTSw] [^112SYNSK].
- **Bempedoic acid**: Option for statin-intolerant patients or as adjunct therapy [^notfound].
- **Icosapent ethyl**: For triglycerides ≥ 150 mg/dL despite statins, reduces ASCVD events [^116vPDwE] [^115v86mc].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

- **Initial monitoring**: 4–12 weeks after therapy initiation or change [^111EoPEv].
- **Subsequent monitoring**: Every 3–12 months based on stability and adherence [^114vKiZW].
- **Nonfasting lipid panels**: Acceptable for routine monitoring [^1138QxsW].

---

## Special populations

- **Elderly patients**: Individualize therapy; moderate-intensity statins often preferred [^112ctU9U].
- **Diabetes**: High-intensity statins for most adults with diabetes [^notfound].
- **Familial hypercholesterolemia**: Aggressive LDL-C lowering, often requiring combination therapy [^112XZmJJ].

---

## Implementation challenges

Implementation challenges include **adherence**, which is often suboptimal and requires patient education and support, and **access**, where cost and insurance coverage can limit access to nonstatin therapies. Clinician awareness of guideline recommendations and patient-specific factors is essential, and structured systems-level approaches can improve adherence and outcomes [^113tgunW] [^1167uBfE].

---

Lipid management guidelines emphasize **risk-based LDL-C lowering** with statins as first-line therapy, adding nonstatins when needed, and reinforcing lifestyle changes and monitoring to reduce ASCVD risk [^1138QxsW] [^112XZmJJ].

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 1-executive summary [^113snnT8]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2014). Low credibility.

Various organizations and agencies have issued recommendations for the management of dyslipidemia. Although many commonalities exist among them, material differences are present as well. The leadership of the National Lipid Association (NLA) convened an Expert Panel to develop a consensus set of recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia in clinical medicine. The current Executive Summary highlights the major conclusions in Part 1 of the recommendations report of the NLA Expert Panel and includes: (1) background and conceptual framework for formulation of the NLA Expert Panel recommendations; (2) screening and classification of lipoprotein lipid levels in adults; (3) targets for intervention in dyslipidemia management; (4) atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk assessment and treatment goals based on risk category; (5) atherogenic cholesterol-non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol-as the primary targets of therapy; and (6) lifestyle and drug therapies intended to reduce morbidity and mortality associated with dyslipidemia.

Special populations

Several specific populations require further attention in future guidelines:

- Younger adults: Although atherosclerosis is known to begin early in life, 10-year risk estimates tend to underrepresent the risk of younger adults due to age's significant impact on risk calculations. While PREVENT begins risk estimates at age 30, current guidelines provide little direction on managing dyslipidemia in younger adults. Future guidelines should incorporate 30-year risk estimates for this population and consider persistent LDL-C elevations (eg, LDL-C > 130 mg/dL despite lifestyle changes) as a risk-enhancing factor. Imaging studies have shown that subclinical atherosclerosis can develop even at LDL-C levels below 130 mg/dL.
- Women of reproductive age: This group warrants special consideration, particularly given the rising prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors in younger women, such as age of menarche, polycystic ovarian syndrome, and adverse pregnancy outcomes such as preeclampsia or gestational diabetes. Fewer than 10% of pregnant women currently maintain optimal cardiovascular health. While the 2018 guidelines mention increases in LDL-C and triglycerides during pregnancy, recommendations are largely limited to discontinuing statin therapy before pregnancy. Given the established relationship between adverse pregnancy outcomes and future ASCVD risk, more comprehensive guidance on lipid management in women of reproductive age is necessary. Recommendations should include prepregnancy dyslipidemia optimization, particularly in women with severe dyslipidemia such as FH or elevated Lp(a), and should incorporate recent National Lipid Association guidelines for managing lipid levels during and after pregnancy.
- South Asian populations: South Asian adults tend to have a higher risk of early and more aggressive ASCVD (nearly double compared to White populations), often at lower levels of traditional risk factors. While the 2018 AHA/ACC Cholesterol Guidelines include South Asian ancestry as a risk-enhancing factor, we believe further specificity is needed. South Asian adults are not a monolith with variation in risk based on country of origin. The prevalence of diabetes and hypertension is elevated and often underrecognized, and dyslipidemia patterns are that of lower LDL-C, higher triglycerides, and lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), emphasizing the importance of non-HDL-C and ApoB in risk assessment. There may also be a case for more aggressive LDL-C targets in high-risk South Asian patients, including consideration of early CAC screening for borderline- or intermediate-risk individuals, especially as available risk calculators typically underestimate ASCVD risk in this population.
- Patients with HIV: The 2018 Cholesterol Guideline recognizes HIV as a risk-enhancing factor, but recent data from the Pitavastatin to Prevent Cardiovascular Disease in HIV Infection (REPRIEVE) trial show that low- to moderate-risk HIV-positive patients benefit from statin therapy. Future guidelines should include specific recommendations for primary prevention in HIV-infected individuals.

### American Heart Association national integrated ASCVD initiative: an implementation initiative to improve lipid management among patients with ASCVD [^111uQYrr]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2025). Medium credibility.

Optimal management of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), the leading cause of death in the United States and worldwide, is a key clinical and public health priority. Cholesterol management is central to the primary and secondary prevention of ASCVD, with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering being consistently proven to reduce rates of major adverse cardiovascular events. Clinical guidelines recommend lipid-lowering therapies for individuals at elevated cardiovascular risk, with therapeutic intensification to lower LDL-C targets in those with higher baseline risk, for whom the greatest absolute risk reduction is anticipated. For individuals with very high-risk ASCVD, the American Heart Association (AHA)/American College of Cardiology Multisociety cholesterol guidelines recommend high-intensity statin therapy to lower LDL-C by ≥ 50%, with the addition of nonstatin lipid-lowering agents if LDL-C remains at a threshold of ≥ 70 mg/dL. Despite extensive clinical trial evidence and strong guideline recommendations, many eligible individuals remain untreated or undertreated with statins and other lipid-lowering therapies. This indicates a need for an enhanced focus on implementation science to ensure that individuals at very high ASCVD risk receive appropriate lipid management.

### The evolution of European guidelines: changing the management of cholesterol levels [^1165rLhC]. Atherosclerosis (2006). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in Europe and the US. This paper reviews the evolution of the Joint European Societies' guidelines with respect to their lipid recommendations. We stress the importance of lowering lipid levels to, or below, the currently recommended goals and argue that patients' global risk for CVD, rather than baseline lipid levels, should direct the intensity of lipid-lowering treatment. However, the emphasis on near-term (i.e., in the next 10 years) global risk estimation may under-emphasize the importance of considering lifetime cardiovascular risk in treatment decisions. Although various guidelines' thresholds for treatment initiation and recommended goals differ, they are similar in the theme of treating global risk. Most clinical trials have not identified a threshold of cholesterol level beyond which lowering cholesterol levels no longer provides cardiovascular benefit. An urgent call for action is needed to improve goal attainment in patients with or at risk for CVD. Improving access to risk-reducing treatments should be a priority.

Case-based framework

Recent guidelines and ECDPs provide the foundation for managing primary and secondary prevention in cardiovascular disease. However, clinical practice often presents challenging patient scenarios that do not fit neatly within current guideline frameworks. In the following sections, several cases are discussed to highlight how these guidelines can be applied to complex clinical situations.

BLOOD PRESSURE AND LIPID TARGETS FOR OLDER PERSONS WITH COMORBIDITIES ACCORDING TO CURRENT GUIDELINES

In current CVRM guidelines, given BP and lipid targets are based on medical history (history of ASCVD) and cardiovascular risk (risk of MACE). Age, comorbidities, and frailty are also taken into account when determining to what extent BP and lipids should be lowered. However, frailty definitions and more specific information about these comorbidities are missing in guidelines. In Tables 1 and 2, we created an overview of the recommendations on BP targets and lipid-lowering treatment for older persons and persons with comorbidities according to the (inter)national guidelines for CVRM in adults. None of these guidelines provided recommendations specifically for persons with dementia.

### Transatlantic lipid guideline divergence: same data but different interpretations [^116MjKyK]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Despite consensus that excessive circulating concentrations of apoB-lipoproteins is a key driver for the atherosclerotic process and that treatments that low-density lipoprotein cholesterol lowering by up-regulation of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol receptor expression reduces that risk, divergent viewpoints on interpretation of study data have resulted in substantial differences in European and American lipid guideline recommendations. This article explores those differences and highlights the importance of understanding guideline-based lipid management to improve patient care and reduce the risk of clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.

Regarding medical management for dyslipidemia, more specifically with respect to PCSK9 inhibitors, EAS/ESC 2020 guidelines recommend to consider adding PCSK9 inhibitor for primary prevention in very high-risk patients if the LDL-C goal is not achieved with a maximum tolerated dose of a statin and ezetimibe.

### Practical solutions for implementation of blood cholesterol guidelines in clinical practice [^1167uBfE]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Underutilization of lipid-lowering therapy (LLT) and failure to attain guideline-recommended low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) goals are important quality gaps in cardiovascular risk optimization, especially among patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Large database analyses demonstrate an unmet need for improved LDL-C measurement, and that nearly 75% of patients with ASCVD have an LDL-C level above guideline-recommended levels, and greater than 50% are not treated with statins or ezetimibe. Proposed solutions for overcoming these obstacles to optimal lipid management include provider- and patient-facing educational interventions, health information technology strategies, implementation of incentive-based care, advocacy efforts, and systems-based process innovations. While individual interventions may not be enough to overcome the totality of barriers to optimal LLT, comprehensive multifaceted approaches that address barriers at the provider, patient, and healthcare delivery level are likely to offer the greatest likelihood of success and improved patient outcomes.

### Systematic review of clinical guidelines for lipid lowering in the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease events [^117XoeLQ]. Open Heart (2020). Medium credibility.

The evidence that 'lower is better' for LDL and non-HDL cholesterol in terms of secondary CVD prevention is well supported by evidence, and the recent advent of PCSK9 inhibitors further supports this notion. The issue at hand is how to use this information clinically to support a testing regimen. In this regard, the use of cholesterol targets for therapy is contentious, in part because the evidence for their use is less strong. While research has shown that achieving targets is associated with better outcomes, no specific randomised controlled trial has shown that randomising patients to a target improves adherence or event rates. Indeed, it might be argued that the maximally tolerated statin should be initiated as the default, and therefore a hard target may be moot. Clearly, other lipid-lowering medications could be added to therapy. Despite the lack of strong evidence, many guidelines recommended specific lipid targets, with many choosing similar values, suggesting that guideline committees are likely to be examining the same evidence. However, one of the most recently published guidelines, the 2019 ESC/EAS Guidelines for the Management of Dyslipidaemias (ESCEAS) advised the lowest cholesterol targets of all the included guidelines (LDL < 1.4 mmol/L), with further lower levels for those with multiple recent cardiovascular events (LDL < 1.0 mmol/L). This was rated as being supported by strong and moderate levels of evidence, although the guidelines acknowledged that both targets are based on the LDL levels achieved in the trials for PCSK9 inhibitors.

### Past, present, and future standards for management of dyslipidemia [^114vdNsK]. The American Journal of Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Evolution of the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Adult Treatment Panel (ATP) guidelines for lipid lowering reflects a movement toward global risk assessment, including improved identification of risk in individuals without established coronary heart disease (CHD), and toward more aggressive lipid-lowering targets to reduce CHD risk. The current guidelines, for example, identify a segment of the population without established CHD as being at high risk on the basis of criteria that indicate CHD risk equivalency, recommend a low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) plasma level < 100 mg/dL as optimal in all individuals, and establish the metabolic syndrome as a secondary target for therapeutic intervention. Many questions remain for future guidelines to address: To what extent should plasma levels of LDL-C be lowered by therapy to afford optimal risk reduction? Can risk assessment be improved, e.g., by using novel risk measures (such as high-sensitivity C-reactive protein) to indicate patients at higher risk who may benefit from more aggressive interventions? Should the metabolic syndrome be considered a high-risk state warranting aggressive intervention irrespective of risk categorization using current scoring methods? Guidelines for lipid management represent a synthesis of constantly emerging and evolving data: ongoing efforts to improve understanding of the relation between dyslipidemia and cardiovascular disease, to increase knowledge of and ability to measure other CHD risk factors, and to improve therapeutic practices and options will be reflected in future guidelines.

Regarding medical management for familial hypercholesterolemia, more specifically with respect to treatment targets, EAS/ESC 2020 guidelines recommend to target LDL-C reduction of ≥ 50% from baseline and LDL-C level of < 1.4 mmol/L (< 55 mg/dL) in very high-risk patients with familial hypercholesterolemia and ASCVD. Initiate a combination therapy if goals cannot be achieved.

### Overview of new ACC / AHA lipid guidelines… [^115SCw1C]. AAFP (2019). Medium credibility.

Clinical Question What do cardiologists recommend for the management of hyperlipidemia. Bottom Line. These updated guidelines, made without any input from primary care physicians who manage most patients with hyperlipidemia, are more complex than the 2013 guidelines and will likely lead to even more recommendations for statins, ezetimibe, and PSK9 inhibitors. Rather than a "fire and forget" strategy involving a risk-based prescription of a moderate- or high-intensity statin, we are supposed to go back to monitoring low-density lipoprotein levels and targeting a percentage reduction in LDL cholesterol — and in very high-risk patients targeting an LDL level of less than 70 mg per dL.

Synopsis This is an update to the 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines, which were the first to base treatment decisions primarily on the 10-year risk of an atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease event rather than on specific LDL targets. This guideline reemphasizes regularly measuring lipids and a return to an LDL target for assessing effectiveness and deciding when to prescribe one of the new and pricey PSK9 inhibitors. For primary prevention in people 20 to 39 years of age, the guidelines recommend an assessment of the lifetime risk of ASCVD as a way to frighten patients into compliance with lifestyle changes. For people 20 to 39 years of age with LDL levels greater than 160 mg per dL or a family history of premature ASCVD, a statin is recommended. For persons with a 7.

5% to 20% risk, they recommend a moderate-intensity statin for most patients to target a 30% to 49% reduction in LDL cholesterol. Finally, if the risk is greater than 20%, a statin to target a 50% or more reduction in LDL cholesterol is recommended. Patients in this category should be taking a high-intensity statin, adding ezetimibe if necessary, to target an LDL level of 70 mg per dL. If that is not achieved, a PSK9 inhibitor should be considered.

### Strategies to improve adult treatment panel III guideline adherence and patient compliance [^116A5uDQ]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2002). Low credibility.

The National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Adult Treatment Panel (ATP) III report outlines the management of hypercholesterolemia through guidelines. These guidelines call for more aggressive diagnosis and treatment of hypercholesterolemia, which will substantially increase the number of individuals in the United States considered to be at risk for heart disease and will expand the number who will receive dietary and drug treatment. The new features of ATP III add complexity to the guidelines, which will impact adherence as well as add challenges to the management of hypercholesterolemia. Following key recommendations and incorporating essential elements of adherence can improve implementation of the NCEP ATP III guidelines. The use of global risk scoring aids, including the Palm Pilot cholesterol risk calculators, can improve guideline adherence and provide education and motivation to patients to maintain compliance.

International LDL-C targets and risk relationship — The risk of ASCVD events is directly proportional to the achieved LDL-C concentration, with benefit observed down to levels below 20 mg/dL, and international guidelines endorse aggressive LDL-C lowering in very high-risk populations; specifically, the European Atherosclerosis Society recommends an LDL-C goal of < 40 mg/dL for patients with recurrent events, while the Lipid Association of India advocates for a target < 30 mg/dL in individuals classified as extreme risk, and patient messaging emphasizes lipid-lowering therapy to reduce ASCVD risk because LDL-C is the building block for atheroma formation.

### A modern approach to dyslipidemia [^113C6sUg]. Endocrine Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Treatment "targets" vs "thresholds".

Cholesterol recommendations from major guideline organizations differ in several aspects, despite each committee being composed of lipid experts, and evaluating essentially the same evidence. A major difference is the LDL-C level at which treatment intensification is recommended. Some guideline organizations (ie, European Atherosclerosis Society/European Society of Cardiology) have opted for a treatment "target", which varies based on guideline organization, and some for a treatment "intensification threshold" (ie, Canadian Cardiovascular Society). The difference is subtle but important. A target level implies that maximal benefit is obtained once the target is attained and may lead to providers possibly back-titrating the dose or even deprescribing medication if the attained level is far below the target. However, most clinical trials of cholesterol-lowering agents were performed by selecting patients with LDL-C exceeding a threshold value, and did not aim for a specific target level: some on-treatment patients attained extremely low LDL-C levels and yet continued to show benefit with respect to ASCVD risk reduction. Advocates for thresholds suggest that these closely approximate the approach used in the clinical trials, and are thus consistent with "evidence-based medicine".

### Systematic review of clinical guidelines for lipid lowering in the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease events [^112HLhFr]. Open Heart (2020). Medium credibility.

Strengths and limitations

To our knowledge, this is the first review to compare guidelines surrounding the management of lipids in the secondary prevention population, as previous research has focused on comparing guidelines for assessing risk and managing it through lifestyle interventions in the primary prevention population only. Furthermore, following a comprehensive search, this identified current guidelines from 22 different professional bodies, covering 16 different geographical regions. Nonetheless, guidelines were only included if their full guideline was available in English, which is likely to have resulted in a bias in the regions included and impacted the number of guidelines compared within this review. Another limitation is that the guidelines' methodological quality, as assessed by the AGREE II tool, was not used to restrict their inclusion in this review, and no comparisons were made between either the recommendations given, their considered level of evidence or their strength, and the AGREE scores. However, given that all included guidelines were assessed to be of generally high quality, such stratification is unlikely to have yielded meaningful differences.

Introduction

The 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) cholesterol management guideline suggests several significant changes to the former treatment paradigm for lipid therapy. 1 One of the most controversial aspects of the guideline is the movement away from a low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C) target attainment approach to a statin initiation strategy that selects statin intensity based on clinical trial evidence of reduction of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events by use of statins in specific populations. The ACC/AHA guideline recommendations result from an analysis of pooled evidence from randomized clinical trials. The guideline recommends evaluating a patient's future risk for ASCVD events; for those individuals in whom the benefit of statin treatment was likely to be greater than the risk of adverse events, statin therapy was recommended. 1 With this approach, individuals should be placed on the evidence‐based, preferred intensity of statin, with adjustments made, if necessary, to accommodate any tolerability issues for that individual. Monitoring LDL‐C levels would then be performed to assess appropriate response to a specific intensity of statin therapy and adherence to therapy. In following this evidence‐based approach, the recommendation for many of these patients is a high‐intensity statin (Figure 1).

Several studies have been conducted since the guideline was introduced in an attempt to identify the potential impact of the guideline. In studies evaluating statin prescribing in which the presence of atherosclerotic coronary artery disease was determined by coronary imaging, a greater proportion of patients were eligible for a statin based on the ACC/AHA guideline compared with the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III guideline. 2, 3 Chia et al compared the Pooled Cohort Risk Score with actual practice data from 1998 to 2007 and found that statin use would need to increase under the new guideline. 4, 5 Preguideline data from the National Cardiovascular Data Registry Practice Innovation and Clinical Excellence registry (2008–2012) and National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data from 2005 to 2010 were assessed to estimate the impact of the guideline on statin practice patterns. This analysis found that compliance with the new guideline should result in a meaningful increase in statin use, especially in the group of patients with 10‐year ASCVD risk ≥ 7.5%. 6, 7

### Addressing current challenges in optimization of lipid management following an ACS event: outcomes of the ACS euroPath III initiative [^112epd5q]. Clinical Cardiology (2023). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the commonest cause of death in Europe, causing over 4 million deaths annually. Acute coronary syndromes (ACS), including unstable angina and myocardial infarction (MI), are life‐threatening manifestations of CVD. Approaches in the acute‐phase management of ACS (including interventional and pharmacological treatment) have evolved over time, and post‐MI mortality has fallen, but could still be reduced further.

Management of low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C) level is one of the least controlled modifiable risk factors in post‐ACS patients. Current guidelines recommend new LDL‐C reduction goals for patients post‐ACS. To this end, these goals were lowered from 1.8 mmol/L (70 mg/dL) to 1.4 mmol/L (55 mg/dL) for all patients with ACS, with the additional aim of achieving at least 50% reduction from baseline; an even lower goal of 1 mmol/L (40 mg/dL) is recommended for patients with recurrent events. It is now important to ensure the implementation of current guidelines into clinical practice, so as to reduce the risk of negative outcomes in patients post‐ACS.

Based on this background, the ACS EuroPath project (initiatives I–III) was designed to help optimize post‐ACS lipid management and improve clinical outcomes. Details of the ACS EuroPath I and II forums have been published previously; a brief overview can be found in Section S1. The aim of the ACS EuroPath III initiative (2020–2021) was to translate existing evidence and guidelines on key topics into accessible, effective, and well‐structured solutions, to address identified gaps and optimize post‐ACS lipid management in clinical practice. Here we describe the proposed solutions, filtered through a pre‐ordered process involving European cardiologists, general practitioners (GPs) and patients.

### The 2013 ACC / AHA guideline on the treatment of blood cholesterol to reduce atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk: a new paradigm supported by more evidence [^113BK1pT]. European Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Aims

The 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association cholesterol guideline was a major paradigm shift and heavily criticized by some experts. A better understanding of the methodology used to develop the guideline, the guideline recommendations, and the evidence supporting them addresses many of criticisms.

Methods and Results

An extensive body of evidence from randomized clinical trials supports the new risk-based approach. The emphasis is on the appropriate intensity of statin therapy in patients most likely to benefit. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines have taken a similar approach. Recent studies have found the 2013 guideline outperforms earlier cholesterol guidelines recommending low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) treatment thresholds and targets. The 2013 cholesterol guideline better identifies high-risk patients with a greater burden of atherosclerosis and avoids treating those at lower risk with little atherosclerosis; its application would prevent up to 450 000 more atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events over 10 years. The 2013 cholesterol guideline also recommends regularly monitoring LDL-C levels to assess adherence to lifestyle and drug therapy, and adjusting treatment based on response to therapy and adverse events. Non-statins shown to reduce ASCVD events when added to statin therapy, and that have an acceptable margin of safety in randomized, controlled clinical trials, are preferred. Ezetimibe has now been shown to meet this standard.

Conclusions

The concept of net benefit introduced in the 2013 ACC/AHA cholesterol guideline identifies patients most likely to benefit from statin therapy to reduce ASCVD risk. Net benefit, incorporating the absolute ASCVD risk of a patient and the relative reduction in ASCVD risk based on the magnitude of LDL-C reduction from the addition of a non-statin, can be used when considering whether to add ezetimibe or another LDL-C lowering drug.

### PCSK9 inhibitors and ezetimibe for the reduction of cardiovascular events: a clinical practice guideline with risk-stratified recommendations [^112SYNSK]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Clinical Question

In adults with low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels > 1.8mmol/L (> 70mg/dL) who are already taking the maximum dose of statins or are intolerant to statins, should another lipid-lowering drug be added, either a proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin 9 (PCSK9) inhibitor or ezetimibe, to reduce the risk of major cardiovascular events? If so, which drug is preferred? Having decided to use one, should we add the other lipid-lowering drug?

Current Practice

Most guidelines emphasise LDL cholesterol targets in their recommendations for prescribing PCSK9 inhibitors and/or ezetimibe in adults at high risk of experiencing a major adverse cardiovascular event. However, to achieve these goals in very high risk patients with statins alone is almost impossible, so physicians are increasingly considering other lipid-lowering drugs solely for achieving LDL cholesterol treatment goals rather than for achieving important absolute cardiovascular risk reduction. Most guidelines do not systematically assess the cardiovascular benefits of adding PCSK9 inhibitors and/or ezetimibe for all risk groups across primary and secondary prevention, nor do they report, in accordance with explicit judgments of assumed patients' values and preferences, absolute benefits and harms and potential treatment burdens.

Recommendations

The guideline panel provided mostly weak recommendations, which means we rely on shared decision making when applying these recommendations. For adults already using statins, the panel suggests adding a second lipid-lowering drug in people at very high and high cardiovascular risk but recommends against adding it in people at low cardiovascular risk. For adults who are intolerant to statins, the panel recommends using a lipid-lowering drug in people at very high and high cardiovascular risk but against adding it in those at low cardiovascular risk. When choosing to add another lipid-lowering drug, the panel suggests ezetimibe in preference to PCSK9 inhibitors. The panel suggests further adding a PCSK9 inhibitor to ezetimibe for adults already taking statins at very high risk and those at very high and high risk who are intolerant to statins.

How This Guideline Was Created

An international panel including patients, clinicians, and methodologists produced these recommendations following standards for trustworthy guidelines and using the GRADE approach. The panel identified four risk groups of patients (low, moderate, high, and very high cardiovascular risk) and primarily applied an individual patient perspective in moving from evidence to recommendations, though societal issues were a secondary consideration. The panel considered the balance of benefits and harms and burdens of starting a PCSK9 inhibitor and/or ezetimibe, making assumptions of adults' average values and preferences. Interactive evidence summaries and decision aids accompany multi-layered recommendations, developed in an online authoring and publication platform (www.magicapp.org) that also allows re-use and adaptation.

The Evidence

A linked systematic review and network meta-analysis (14 trials including 83660 participants) of benefits found that PCSK9 inhibitors or ezetimibe probably reduce myocardial infarctions and stroke in patients with very high and high cardiovascular risk, with no impact on mortality (moderate to high certainty evidence), but not in those with moderate and low cardiovascular risk. PCSK9 inhibitors may have similar effects to ezetimibe on reducing non-fatal myocardial infarction or stroke (low certainty evidence). These relative benefits were consistent, but their absolute magnitude varied based on cardiovascular risk in individual patients (for example, for 1000 people treated with PCSK9 inhibitors in addition to statins over five years, benefits ranged from 2 fewer strokes in the lowest risk to 21 fewer in the highest risk). Two systematic reviews on harms found no important adverse events for these drugs (moderate to high certainty evidence). PCSK9 inhibitors require injections that sometimes result in injection site reactions (best estimate 15 more per 1000 in a 5 year timeframe), representing a burden and harm that may matter to patients. The MATCH-IT decision support tool allows you to interact with the evidence and your patients across the alternative options: https://magicevidence.org/match-it/220504dist-lipid-lowering-drugs/.

Understanding The Recommendations

The stratification into four cardiovascular risk groups means that, to use the recommendations, physicians need to identify their patient's risk first. We therefore suggest, specific to various geographical regions, using some reliable risk calculators that estimate patients' cardiovascular risk based on a mix of known risk factors. The largely weak recommendations concerning the addition of ezetimibe or PCSK9 inhibitors reflect what the panel considered to be a close balance between small reductions in stroke and myocardial infarctions weighed against the burdens and limited harms. Because of the anticipated large variability of patients' values and preferences, well informed choices warrant shared decision making. Interactive evidence summaries and decision aids linked to the recommendations can facilitate such shared decisions. The strong recommendations against adding another drug in people at low cardiovascular risk reflect what the panel considered to be a burden without important benefits. The strong recommendation for adding either ezetimibe or PCSK9 inhibitors in people at high and very high cardiovascular risk reflect a clear benefit. The panel recognised the key uncertainty in the evidence concerning patient values and preferences, namely that what most people consider important reductions in cardiovascular risks, weighed against burdens and harms, remains unclear. Finally, availability and costs will influence decisions when healthcare systems, clinicians, or people consider adding ezetimibe or PCSK9 inhibitors.

### Lipid management in patients presenting with acute coronary syndromes: a review [^112C2ng3]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Despite many improvements in its prevention and management, acute coronary syndrome (ACS) remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the developed world. Lipid management is an important part of secondary prevention after ACS, but many patients currently remain undertreated and do not attain guideline-recommended levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol reduction. This review details the current state of evidence on lipid management in patients presenting with ACS, provides directions for identification of patients who may benefit from early escalation of lipid-lowering therapy, and discusses novel lipid-lowering medication that is currently under investigation in clinical trials. Moreover, a treatment algorithm aimed at attaining guideline-recommended low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels is proposed. Despite important advances in the initial treatment and secondary prevention of ACS, ≈20% of ACS survivors experience a subsequent ischemic cardiovascular event within 24 months, and 5-year mortality ranges from 19% to 22%. Knowledge of the current state of evidence-based lipid management after ACS is of paramount importance to improve outcomes after ACS.

### LDL cholesterol management simplified in adults-lower for longer is better: guidance from the National Lipid Association [^113KaHZB]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

ASCVD remains the #1 cause of death in the United States and has been on the rise for more than a decade after more than 40 years of steady decline. Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is a well-established causal factor for the development of ASCVD that should be monitored in a timely manner and may be modified through both lifestyle and pharmacological interventions. Despite the existence of cholesterol guidelines, universal screening ages, risk assessment tools, and recommendations for LDL-C management based on risk, data show that LDL-C measurement and management in patients with ASCVD are not meeting guideline-directed objectives. Further, there is no single clinical guideline that presents LDL-C measurement frequency, risk assessment, management, and desirable LDL-C levels for adults based on risk.

Objective

This document aims to summarize the numerous guidelines and recommendations from leading professional organizations to help clinicians and patients improve evidence-based measurement and management of LDL-C.

Methods

Guidelines and updates from the American College of Cardiology, American Heart Association, National Lipid Association, and other relevant professional organizations were systematically reviewed. Key recommendations were synthesized and translated into a simplified, patient-centered message for clinical application.

Results

The synthesis revealed consistent recommendations across major guidelines emphasizing early identification of risk, aggressive lipid lowering in high-risk populations, and the use of shared decision-making to improve adherence. The resulting simplified message aligns with current evidence and is intended to support clinical teams in delivering consistent, guideline-directed care.

Conclusion

Integrating major cardiovascular and lipid management guidelines into a unified, simplified message may improve provider clarity and patient understanding. This approach supports team-based care, reduces variation in practice, and enhances the implementation of evidence-based strategies to reduce atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk. The primary goals for LDL-C management are to achieve an acceptable level for the patient's risk category and to maintain that over time because lower for longer is better to reduce ASCVD risk.

### Systematic review of clinical guidelines for lipid lowering in the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease events [^111mkMLv]. Open Heart (2020). Medium credibility.

Methods

A protocol which documented the prespecified analysis and the inclusion criteria for this systematic review was first registered on the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews on 19 June 2018 (Ref: CRD42018098582).

Literature search

A search of Medline, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature and Turning Research Into Practice databases was conducted for all guidelines published in the ten years prior to 31 December 2019. In addition, several guideline specific databases were searched: National Guideline Clearinghouse (USA), the National Library for Health Guidelines Finder (UK), the Canadian Medical Association Clinical Practice Guidelines Infobase and Guidelines International Network International Guideline Library. Finally, an additional hand search was performed to identify the most recent versions of the guidelines identified through the systematic search. A copy of the search strategy is included in the online supplemental material.

Selection process

Papers were retained if they met the Institute of Medicine's 2011 definition of a clinical guideline, 'Clinical Practice Guidelines are statement that include recommendations intended to optimize patient care that are informed by a systematic review of evidence and an assessment of the benefits and harms of alternative care options'. As the focus of this systematic review was the management of patients with established CVD, guidelines were only retained within the review if their specific management was detailed, regardless of whether they covered established CVD as a whole, or for the management of patients after a specific event, such as myocardial infarction or stroke. Only the most recent version of the guidelines was retained, with any previous versions removed. Finally, included guidelines had to apply to Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries, produced by a professional organisation, and have the full version of the guidelines available in English.

Two reviewers (REB and JL) independently reviewed the titles and abstracts of the results against the eligibility criteria. The same two reviewers also performed the full-text review, where the reason for exclusion of the guidelines was also documented. In both instances, any discrepancies of opinion were resolved through discussion.

Treatment recommendations

Future guidelines should harmonize ACC/AHA treatment approaches with those of contemporary international guidelines. For example, the ESC recommendation that secondary prevention patients should target an LDL-C < 55 mg/dL is a more stringent goal than current ACC/AHA guidelines and should be considered. Of note, AHA/ACC guidelines and ACC ECDP rely mainly on randomized controlled trial evidence. The ESC guidelines emphasize randomized controlled trials but take into account the totality of evidence, including nonrandomized trials and epidemiologic studies. Therefore, the more aggressive recommendations are based on data beyond clinical outcome trials. In addition, patients with high plaque burden (CAC ≥ 300) should be treated to a similar LDL-C target. In alignment with ESC and CCS guidelines, PCSK9 inhibitors should be considered in treatment algorithms for high-risk primary prevention patients, not solely for secondary prevention or those with LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL.

There is also merit in considering pharmacotherapy for low- and moderate-risk patients with persistently elevated LDL-C despite lifestyle modification. This recommendation is supported by data from the Cholesterol Lowering in Intermediate-Risk Persons without Cardiovascular Disease (HOPE-3) trialand recent imaging studies demonstrating early, yet reversible, plaque formation in patients with dyslipidemia. The forthcoming PRECAD (Prevent Coronary Artery Disease) trial will provide further insights into this issue.

The 2021 ACC ECDP on the Management of ASCVD Risk Reduction in Patients With Persistent Hypertriglyceridemia should also remain central to future guideline updates, particularly in light of the REDUCE (Cardiovascular Risk Reduction with Icosapent Ethyl for Hypertriglyceridemia) trial results, which were published after the 2018 guidelines. This trial established the benefit of icosapent ethyl, a highly purified eicosapentaenoic acid ethyl ether derivative, in reducing cardiovascular risk in those with persistent hypertriglyceridemia. However, there has been controversy about the use of a mineral oil placebo in REDUCE-IT, and conflicting data from the STRENGTH (Effect of High-Dose Omega-3 Fatty Acids vs Corn Oil on Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events in Patients at High Cardiovascular Risk) trial, which used corn oil and a different omega-3 fatty acid preparation. Despite this, the ACC ECDP, ESC, and CCS recommend icosapent ethyl for residual hypertriglyceridemia. In addition, the ACC/AHA Cholesterol Guidelines should offer specific recommendations for managing individuals with elevated Lp(a), in line with recent National Lipid Association guidance, which advocates initiating or intensifying therapy in those with LDL-C ≥ 70 mg/dL.

Regarding medical management for dyslipidemia, more specifically with respect to PCSK9 inhibitors, CCS 2021 guidelines recommend to intensify lipid-lowering therapy with a PCSK9 inhibitor and/or ezetimibe for secondary prevention in all patients with CVD, if LDL-C remains ≥ 1.8 mmol/L (or non-HDL-C ≥ 2.4 mmol/L or ApoB ≥ 0.7 g/L) while receiving the maximally tolerated statin dose. Initiate PCSK9 inhibitor therapy if ezetimibe is used initially and LDL-C remains ≥ 1.8 mmol/L (or non-HDL-C ≥ 2.4 mmol/L or ApoB ≥ 0.7 g/L).

### Transatlantic lipid guideline divergence: same data but different interpretations [^1119APHn]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Despite consensus that excessive circulating concentrations of apoB‐lipoproteins is a key driver for the atherosclerotic process and that treatments that low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol lowering by up‐regulation of low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol receptor expression reduces that risk, divergent viewpoints on interpretation of study data have resulted in substantial differences in European and American lipid guideline recommendations. This article explores those differences and highlights the importance of understanding guideline‐based lipid management to improve patient care and reduce the risk of clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.

### Dyslipidemia management for cardiovascular disease… [^113kNSbh]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- In primary prevention, moderate-dose statins are recommended when treatment is indicated.
- In secondary prevention, moderate-dose statins are recommended with intensification by increasing statin dose, adding ezetimibe, or adding a PCSK9 inhibitor in higher-risk patients.
- Because cholesterol values are stable over 10 years, new measurements are not needed for each risk assessment. Primary Prevention Without known cardiovascular disease, treatment decisions should be based on estimated 10-year risk calculators such as the pooled cohort equations. Treatment is recommended at a 10-year risk of 12%, which matches the populations that experienced benefit in clinical trials. People with diabetes mellitus and/or low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels of at least 190 mg per dL are also at high risk and should be offered treatment regardless of estimated risk.

Shared decision-making is recommended with 10-year risk between 6% and 12%, which represents populations less studied in clinical trials. Moderate-dose statins are the sole medication recommended for primary prevention. The group recommends against high-dose statins, citing lack of additional benefit and an increase in risks. The guideline does not suggest one statin over another. Because moderate dosing is recommended for all patients, the guideline does not recommend titrating dosage to a specific cholesterol level. There is no evidence that ezetimibe, proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors, icosapent ethyl, fibrates, bempedoic acid, or niacin is beneficial in primary prevention. Secondary Prevention Patients with known coronary artery disease are at high enough risk to require treatment. Moderate-dose statins are the baseline in this group because no other treatment has a greater impact on mortality.

The guideline recommends considering more intense treatment, especially in higher-risk patients. High-dose statin therapy reduced major cardiovascular events in the higher-risk patients studied. Diet One diet has clinical evidence of decreasing risk in primary and secondary prevention. A dietitian-led Mediterranean diet decreases rates of cardiovascular events, stroke, type 2 diabetes, and all-cause mortality. Omega-3 fatty acid supplementation has been studied extensively but does not reduce cardiovascular risk. Fiber, ginger, green tea, garlic, and red yeast rice have been suggested for dyslipidemia, but evidence is insufficient for recommendation.

### Lipid management in cardiovascular disease prevention guidelines: strategies and tactics for implementation [^114i3PGA]. Atherosclerosis (2008). Low credibility.

Despite the widespread dissemination of clinical practice guidelines on the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease (CVD), CVD causes one third of deaths worldwide and almost half of all deaths in the developed world. It is therefore likely that, although some aspects of CVD management have improved, there is still a significant shortfall between what is known about CVD prevention and what is put into action. Twenty-one experts in the field of CVD from around the world attended a focus panel meeting in Marlow-on-Thames, UK (see acknowledgements for a list of meeting participants). These experts were invited to discuss practical strategies and tactics for overcoming barriers to the implementation of guidelines on CVD prevention, and lipid management in particular. This article reviews and updates the key topics presented during the course of the meeting, captures the essence of the group discussions, and summarizes the meeting outcomes. The participants concluded that initial efforts to implement CVD prevention guidelines more effectively are best directed at high-risk patients who have already been identified. Once current patients achieve their targets, more attention can be paid to finding untreated patients at risk. Recommendations from the expert panel included: Harmonize guidelines; focus on common areas of consensus rather than state-of-the-art science. Remove the boundary between primary and secondary prevention and focus on level of overall risk. Help policy makers understand the different components of CVD. Include professional societies from different specialties in guideline development and implementation, to increase ownership and decrease fragmentation of guideline committees.

### Counterpoint: low-density lipoprotein cholesterol targets are not needed in lipid treatment guidelines [^111PbaPQ]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2016). Low credibility.

On the basis of accumulating evidence, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) treat-to-goal approaches no longer seem to be the best way to optimize lipid-modifying therapy to prevent atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). The potential for a net ASCVD risk reduction benefit is a more individualized approach to clinical decision making and may better inform patient preferences. However, risk estimation tools will need to be developed to facilitate more personalized CVD risk estimation in statin-treated patients. In the meantime, LDL-C thresholds rather than targets may aid in determining which patients might benefit from additional LDL-C-lowering therapy beyond statins.

### LDL cholesterol management simplified in adults-lower for longer is better: guidance from the National Lipid Association [^113uwnEm]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2025). High credibility.

Desirable LDL-C targets for adults: Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) management should be individualized, and evidence supports an LDL-C target of < 100 mg/dL for healthy adults in the general population; individuals at risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), including those with very high baseline LDL-C suggestive of familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), multiple risk factors, or established ASCVD, may require lower LDL-C levels, and higher plaque burden or progression are situations where more intensive LDL-C lowering therapy should be considered.

### Lipids and CVD management: towards a global consensus [^117JEJqa]. European Heart Journal (2005). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is currently the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide and its incidence is likely to increase. Multiple risk factors contribute to CVD. Elevated LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) and triglyceride levels, low HDL-cholesterol levels, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and smoking are key modifiable risk factors. Such risk factors are present in 80–90% of coronary heart disease (CHD) patients. For many factors, modification can significantly reduce CVD incidence. For example, statin-induced LDL-C reductions reduce cardiovascular events by 24–37% and smoking cessation reduces CHD mortality by 36%. The need to identify and treat these risk factors has led many national and local groups to develop clinical practice guidelines for management of CVD. Although the aim of such guidelines is to provide practitioners with a framework to identify, prioritize, and manage patients, the plethora of guidelines can cause confusion. In addition, research indicates that guidelines are not being optimally implemented. This review considers these practical issues, highlights the common goals shared by many guidelines, and focuses on how these can be best achieved. It also highlights areas where the guidelines differ and discusses points to consider when selecting the most appropriate recommendation.

### Consensus clinical recommendations for the management of plasma lipid disorders in the middle east: 2021 update [^11216YWL]. Atherosclerosis (2022). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Disorders of plasma lipids remain key risk factors for the development of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) in the Middle East and are estimated to increase more dramatically in the next decade than in any other global region except Africa. This statement is an update to the 2016 consensus clinical recommendations for the management of plasma lipid disorders in the Middle East, following the evaluation of newer cholesterol-lowering agents in randomised controlled cardiovascular outcome trials, as well as the publication of revised international guidelines.

Methods

A multidisciplinary panel of regional experts was convened to update the consensus clinical recommendations for the management of plasma lipids in the Middle East. The recommendations constructed in 2016 were reviewed against emerging research since publication.

Results

Newly developed Middle East ASCVD risk categories were established using the multiple risk group categories from the recently updated international guidelines and the epidemiological evidence from the Gulf Region. These consensus recommendations support a more intensive reduction of LDL-C across cardiovascular risk categories. Alongside low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, we recommend non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol as a primary treatment target. Lifestyle modifications remain the first-line treatment recommendation for all patients. The first-line pharmacological treatment in patients with dyslipidaemia is statin therapy, with a number of second-line agents available. The selection of a second lipid-lowering agent for combination therapy with statin should be based on the lipid-lowering target of the patient. Guidance is also provided on the management of underlying conditions and special populations; of particular pertinence in the region are familial hypercholesterolaemia, diabetes and metabolic dyslipidaemia. New therapies have emerged from research that found positive outcomes in reducing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. The initial results of these newly researched drugs strongly indicate their inclusion as future therapies in dyslipidaemia management in the Middle East.

Conclusions

These updated consensus clinical recommendations provide practicing clinicians with comprehensive, region-specific guidance to improve the detection and management of plasma lipid disorders in patients in the Middle East.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 1 – full report [^1154wzMH]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

Initiation of drug therapy — statin intensity and targets: Unless contraindicated, first-line drug therapy for treatment of elevated atherogenic cholesterol levels is a moderate- or high-intensity statin, and a moderate-intensity statin will generally lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) by 30% to < 50% and a high-intensity statin by ≥ 50%, although individual patient responses should be expected to vary considerably. Some clinicians prefer to start with a high-intensity statin and reduce the dosage if the patient experiences intolerance, while others prefer to start with a moderate-intensity statin and titrate upward if additional lowering of atherogenic cholesterol is desired; if drug therapy is used, the panel consensus view was that at least a 30% reduction in atherogenic cholesterol should be targeted. Some patients have contraindications for, or intolerance to, statin therapy, and for such patients, nonstatin drug therapy may be considered.

### A critical appraisal of lipid management in the post-statin era: comparison on guidelines, therapeutic targets, and screening in a case-based framework of lipid management [^114TQr7H]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

This review discusses current options for LLT and summarizes recent major guidelines for lipid management. Furthermore, it seeks to close the divide between evidence-based guidelines and the complex scenarios often encountered in everyday clinical practice, providing actionable guidance for evaluation and management of ASCVD risk. By interpreting current recommendations and emphasizing the role of newer therapies, this work aims to equip clinicians with the knowledge necessary to make personalized, informed treatment decisions to optimize patient outcomes (Central Illustration).

Central Illustration
Comprehensive Evaluation of Cardiovascular Risk and Management of Hyperlipidemia

The treatment of dyslipidemia starts with a clinician patient discussion to assess goals, potential, and options. The cornerstone of risk assessment is the use of clinically available risk-estimation calculators. Risk should further be personalized based on actors such as lipids, hypertension, diabetes, family history, and past medical history as well as imaging for subclinical atherosclerosis. Treatment begins with lifestyle modifications, and the degree of LDL-C lowering should be tailored to the risk of the patient with low LDL-C treatment thresholds for higher-risk patients. Statins remain the foundation of lipid-lowering therapy with additional medications added as needed based on achieved LDL-C levels, treatment goals, and adverse effects. Reassessment of therapy should be an ongoing process as should risk assessment and clinician patient discussions.

### New cardiovascular prevention guidelines: how to optimally manage dyslipidaemia and cardiovascular risk in 2021 in patients needing secondary prevention? [^1161rx8r]. Atherosclerosis (2021). Medium credibility.

Elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is a principally modifiable cause of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease; accordingly, recent European and US multisociety dyslipidaemia guidelines emphasise the importance of lowering LDL-C to reduce cardiovascular risk. This review provides perspectives on established and emerging agents that reduce LDL-C to help providers synthesize the abundance of new evidence related to prevention of cardiovascular disease. We provide hypothetical cases of patients with different cardiovascular risk factors and medical histories to illustrate application of current lipid-lowering guidelines in various clinical settings. As a core focus of preventive therapy, both European and US lipid management guidelines emphasise the importance of identifying patients at very high cardiovascular risk and treating to achieve LDL-C levels as low as possible, with European guidelines setting a goal of < 1.4 mmol/L (< 55 mg/dL) in patients with very high-risk cardiovascular disease. The proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors are now included in the guidelines and may fulfil an important unmet need for very high-risk patients who are not able to achieve LDL-C goals with conventional agents. The recently approved bempedoic acid and other promising agents under development will add to the armamentarium of lipid-lowering drugs available for clinicians to help patients meet their treatment goals.

### Lipid management in patients presenting with acute coronary syndromes: a review [^111xjE7e]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Despite many improvements in its prevention and management, acute coronary syndrome (ACS) remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the developed world. Lipid management is an important part of secondary prevention after ACS, but many patients currently remain undertreated and do not attain guideline‐recommended levels of low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol reduction. This review details the current state of evidence on lipid management in patients presenting with ACS, provides directions for identification of patients who may benefit from early escalation of lipid‐lowering therapy, and discusses novel lipid‐lowering medication that is currently under investigation in clinical trials. Moreover, a treatment algorithm aimed at attaining guideline‐recommended low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol levels is proposed. Despite important advances in the initial treatment and secondary prevention of ACS, ≈20% of ACS survivors experience a subsequent ischemic cardiovascular event within 24 months, and 5‐year mortality ranges from 19% to 22%. Knowledge of the current state of evidence‐based lipid management after ACS is of paramount importance to improve outcomes after ACS.

### Review of clinical practice guidelines for the management of LDL-related risk [^113MJKs8]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Managing risk related to low-density lipoprotein (LDL) is vital in therapy for patients at risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events given its important etiologic role in atherogenesis. Despite decades of research showing reduction of ASCVD risk with multiple approaches to lowering of LDL cholesterol, there continue to be significant gaps in care with inadequate numbers of patients receiving standard of care lipid-lowering therapy. Confusion regarding implementation of the multiple published clinical practice guidelines has been identified as one contributor to suboptimal management of LDL-related risk. This review summarizes the current guidelines for reduction of LDL-related cardiovascular risk provided by a number of major professional societies, which have broad applicability to diverse populations worldwide. Statements have varied in the process and methodology of development of recommendations, the grading system for level and strength of evidence, the inclusion or exclusion of expert opinion, the suggested ASCVD risk assessment tool, the lipoproteins recommended for risk assessment, and the lipoprotein targets of therapy. The similarities and differences among important guidelines in the United States and internationally are discussed, with recommendations for future strategies to improve consistency in approaches to LDL-related ASCVD risk and to reduce gaps in implementation of evidence-based therapies.

Lipid testing

Beyond conventional recommendations for lipid testing, selective evaluation of additional lipoproteins should be considered. First, Lp(a) screening should be given strong consideration, considering a high prevalence of ∼20% in the general population. Lp(a) is a widely recognized independent risk factor for ASCVD and has been listed as a risk-enhancing factor in U.S.-based guidelines. However, many major societies recommend universal Lp(a) testing, and the time has come for ACC/AHA guidelines to follow suit. However, while trends are shifting toward universal screening, it is worth nothing that there are no specific Lp(a)-lowering treatments currently available. While there is guidance regarding contemporary treatment, specific outcome trials of Lp(a)-lowering drugs are ongoing. While it is noted as a risk-enhancing factor in AHA/ACC Cholesterol Guidelines, there is a need for clearer guidance on apolipoprotein B (ApoB) testing, given its critical role in the pathophysiology of ASCVD and as a risk factor, especially in patients with metabolic syndrome and high levels of triglycerides. European and Canadian guidelines already recommend ApoB measurement, and the National Lipid Association's recent guidance in this area is encouraging. As with Lp(a), it warrants mention that LLT outcome trials have not used ApoB as a target of treatment, and therefore, recommendations in this regard are based on secondary analyses.

### A lipidologist perspective of global lipid guidelines and recommendations, part 2: lipid treatment goals [^113DoYP2]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Low credibility.

Having knowledge of worldwide areas of harmonization and consensus regarding lipid guidelines and recommendations may provide clinicians a more global perspective on lipid management. This review examines 8 international scientific/medical organizations that have issued lipid guidelines, recommendations, and position papers: the National Lipid Association (2014), National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (2014), International Atherosclerosis Society (2013), American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (2013), Canadian Cardiovascular Society (2013), Japan Atherosclerosis Society (2012), European Society of Cardiology/European Atherosclerosis Society (2012), and Adult Treatment Panel III (2001/2004). Part 1 of this perspective focused on sentinel components of these lipid guidelines and recommendations as applied to the role of atherogenic lipoprotein cholesterol levels, primary lipid target of therapy, other primary and secondary lipid treatment targets, and assessment of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk. This part 2 examines goals of lipid-altering therapy. While lipid guidelines and recommendations may differ regarding ASCVD risk assessment and lipid treatment goals, lipid guidelines and recommendations generally agree on the need to reduce atherogenic lipoprotein cholesterol levels, with statins being the first-line treatment of choice.

### Evolving management of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol: a personalized approach to preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease across the risk continuum [^1147bDQZ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

Management of elevated low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C) is central to preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and key to reducing the risk of ASCVD events. Current guidelines on the management of blood cholesterol recommend statins as first‐line therapy for LDL‐C reduction according to an individual's ASCVD risk and baseline LDL‐C levels. The addition of nonstatin lipid‐lowering therapy to statins to achieve intensive LDL‐C lowering is recommended for patients at very high risk of ASCVD events, including patients with familial hypercholesterolemia who have not achieved adequate LDL‐C lowering with statins alone. Despite guideline recommendations and clinical trial evidence to support the use of lipid‐lowering therapies for ASCVD risk reduction, most patients at high or very high risk do not meet LDL‐C thresholds. This review explores the challenges associated with LDL‐C lowering in contemporary clinical practice and proposes a framework for rethinking the binary definition of ASCVD, shifting from "primary" versus "secondary" prevention to a "continuum of risk". The approach considers the role of plaque burden and progression in subclinical disease and emphasizes the importance of early risk assessment and treatment for preventing first cardiovascular events. Patients at high risk of ASCVD events who require significant LDL‐C lowering should be considered for combination therapies comprising statin and nonstatin agents. Practical guidance for the pharmacological management of elevated LDL‐C, both now and in the future, is provided.

### Managing abnormal blood lipids: a collaborative approach [^114k9PhJ]. Circulation (2005). Low credibility.

Current data and guidelines recommend treating abnormal blood lipids (ABL) to goal. This is a complex process and requires involvement from various healthcare professionals with a wide range of expertise. The model of a multidisciplinary case management approach for patients with ABL is well documented and described. This collaborative approach encompasses primary and secondary prevention across the lifespan, incorporates nutritional and exercise management as a significant component, defines the importance and indications for pharmacological therapy, and emphasizes the importance of adherence. Use of this collaborative approach for the treatment of ABL ultimately will improve cardiovascular and cerebrovascular morbidity and mortality.

### Current guidelines on screening, diagnosis and management of dyslipidaemia in childhood: a systematic review [^111W6pDi]. Pediatric Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Early identification and treatment of lipid disorders has the potential to improve long-term cardiovascular health in affected individuals. We performed a systematic review of guidelines on screening, diagnosis, and management of dyslipidaemias in children.

Methods

We searched Medline, Embase, and selected websites for relevant clinical practice recommendations/guidelines, published in English/German from 01.01.2018 to 31.01.2025. We used AGREE II tool to assess guidelines' quality.

Results

Six national guidelines, mainly on familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), were included. Recommendations for universal screening for dyslipidaemias in childhood differed, ranging from the statement of insufficient evidence (n = 1) or negative recommendation of the national screening committee (n = 1) through weak (n = 2) to moderate (n = 1) recommendations to consider population screening. All organizations recommended statins as a first-line drug therapy in children with FH (strong recommendation). Behavioral intervention was mainly strongly recommended as an additional treatment component of FH, and as therapy of choice in childhood obesity related dyslipidaemia. Guidelines applied different systems to categorize certainty of evidence and strength of recommendations. 50% of guidelines scored high (> 70%) for rigor of development.

Conclusions

Current guidelines provide overall consistent recommendations for the management of childhood dyslipidaemias, but show lack of consensus regarding universal screening for early detection of lipid disorders.

Impact

Health behavior counseling is recommended for all children affected with dyslipidaemia. Statins are consistently proposed as a first-line drug therapy in pediatric familial hypercholesterolemia. Recommendations for universal screening for dyslipidaemias in childhood vary. This systematic review provides insights into current recommendations on pediatric lipid disorders, explores potential reasons for discrepancies, and indicates the need for consensus on the optimal strategy for early identification of familial hypercholesterolemia.

### 2018 cholesterol clinical practice guidelines: synopsis of the 2018 American Heart Association / American college of cardiology / multisociety cholesterol guideline [^1138QxsW]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Description

In November 2018, the American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology (AHA/ACC) released a new clinical practice guideline on cholesterol management. It was accompanied by a risk assessment report on primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD).

Methods

A panel of experts free of recent and relevant industry-related conflicts was chosen to carry out systematic reviews and meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that examined cardiovascular outcomes. High-quality observational studies were used for estimation of ASCVD risk. An independent panel systematically reviewed RCT evidence about the benefits and risks of adding nonstatin medications to statin therapy compared with receiving statin therapy alone in persons who have or are at high risk for ASCVD.

Recommendation

The guideline endorses a heart-healthy lifestyle beginning in childhood to reduce lifetime risk for ASCVD. It contains several new features compared with the 2013 guideline. For secondary prevention, patients at very high risk may be candidates for adding nonstatin medications (ezetimibe or proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 [PCSK9] inhibitors) to statin therapy. In primary prevention, a clinician-patient risk discussion is still strongly recommended before a decision is made about statin treatment. The AHA/ACC risk calculator first triages patients into 4 risk categories. Those at intermediate risk deserve a focused clinician-patient discussion before initiation of statin therapy. Among intermediate-risk patients, identification of risk-enhancing factors and coronary artery calcium testing can assist in the decision to use a statin. Compared with the 2013 guideline, the new guideline gives more attention to percentage reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol as a treatment goal and to long-term monitoring of therapeutic efficacy. To simplify monitoring, nonfasting lipid measurements are allowed.

### International atherosclerosis society guidance for implementing best practice in the care of familial hypercholesterolaemia [^115GcVcr]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2023). High credibility.

This contemporary, international, evidence-informed guidance aims to achieve the greatest good for the greatest number of people with familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) across different countries. FH, a family of monogenic defects in the hepatic LDL clearance pathway, is a preventable cause of premature coronary artery disease and death. Worldwide, 35 million people have FH, but most remain undiagnosed or undertreated. Current FH care is guided by a useful and diverse group of evidence-based guidelines, with some primarily directed at cholesterol management and some that are country-specific. However, none of these guidelines provides a comprehensive overview of FH care that includes both the lifelong components of clinical practice and strategies for implementation. Therefore, a group of international experts systematically developed this guidance to compile clinical strategies from existing evidence-based guidelines for the detection (screening, diagnosis, genetic testing and counselling) and management (risk stratification, treatment of adults or children with heterozygous or homozygous FH, therapy during pregnancy and use of apheresis) of patients with FH, update evidence-informed clinical recommendations, and develop and integrate consensus-based implementation strategies at the patient, provider and health-care system levels, with the aim of maximizing the potential benefit for at-risk patients and their families worldwide.

These 4 hypothetical cases highlight some of the new features in the 2018 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology multisociety cholesterol management guidelines. Topics include management issues in a secondary prevention patient judged to be at very high risk of another event, a patient with familial hypercholesterolemia with a low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level of 190 mg/dL or greater (to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.0259), a primary prevention patient with intermediate (7.5%-19.9%) 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular risk, and a patient who has statin-associated adverse effects. A multiple-choice format is used to engage clinicians in selecting the best choice based on guidance from the new 2018 cholesterol management guidelines.

### Key recommendations on managing dyslipidemia for… [^116nDcCL]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

Secondary Prevention For secondary prevention, we recommend moderate-dose statins as the mainstay of treatment. This is consistent with trial evidence, and evidence is insufficient to show improved cardiovascular and all-cause mortality with higher-intensity treatment over moderate-dose statins. 11 Moderate-dose statins have fewer adverse effects than high-dose statins; therefore, we strongly recommend them as the first step in therapy to reduce cardiovascular risk. 1, 6 The ACC/AHA recommends intensive therapy in secondary prevention unless medications cannot be tolerated.
2. We recommend offering more intensive therapy to patients who wish to further reduce their risk. 1 Switching to high-dose statins and adding ezetimibe or PCSK9 inhibitors to statins reduces nonfatal cardiovascular events more than moderate-dose statins alone, each to a similar extent.

11 All were studied primarily in higher-risk populations, such as those with acute coronary syndrome, recurrent cardiac events, or tobacco use. Because of the uncertain long-term effects and high cost of PCSK9 inhibitors, we recommend increasing the statin dose and adding ezetimibe before considering the use of PCSK9 inhibitors.
1. Lipid Testing Although the ACC/AHA recommends treating to LDL-C targets, this paradigm has not been prospectively studied. 1, 2 All primary and secondary prevention trials compared medication doses, most often a medication compared with placebo. Although post-hoc meta-analyses show that higher-intensity medications correlate with lower LDL-C levels and lower event rates, these secondary analyses do not add any specificity to existing trial results. 12 We recommend treatment based on medication intensity to match the evidence, which also simplifies monitoring.

After starting medication based on treatment intensity, further measurement of cholesterol is unnecessary. Even while making primary prevention decisions, we find the evidence supports infrequent lipid monitoring. Risk calculators demonstrate that patient factors such as obesity, hypertension, diabetes, and tobacco use influence risk scores significantly more than cholesterol values. Cholesterol levels are stable for up to 10 years, with most change between measurements due to testing variability. 13 There is no need to repeatedly measure cholesterol more than once a decade for risk calculations. Using previous cholesterol values to calculate risk every two to five years offers the opportunity to decrease unnecessary testing. When cholesterol levels are measured, nonfasting samples have equivalent accuracy and should be used routinely. Indications for fasting samples are limited, such as verifying hypertriglyceridemia if considering icosapent ethyl.

### Systematic review of clinical guidelines for lipid lowering in the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease events [^114VE2DQ]. Open Heart (2020). Medium credibility.

However, the WHO has offered no specific guidance regarding target plasma lipid levels or the monitoring of these since the publication of their prevention of cardiovascular guidelines in 2007. Indeed, different national or international guidelines have contrasting recommendations. For example, the use of on-treatment cholesterol targets has proved controversial in recent years. Prescriptions of higher doses of lipid-lowering therapy are more likely in the pursuit of increasingly lower lipid targets with the aim of reducing a patient's risk of further cardiovascular events. However, higher doses of medication also lead to an increased likelihood of side effects, which could result in further costs or even non-adherence or discontinuation in patients, reducing the potential reduction in risk. The long-term follow-up of lipids in high-risk populations poses a significant burden of time to patients, and costs to healthcare. Specifically, increased biochemistry costs from expanding clinical demand have been flagged as a major financial burden. Therefore, effectively balancing the costs of follow-up with the reduction in cardiovascular risk within a given population represents a significant challenge, with countries and regions likely to have differing approaches.

This systematic review aimed to investigate similarities and differences in clinical guidelines surrounding the recommendations for the therapeutic treatment, targets and monitoring of lipid risk factors in adults who have established CVD. This will help to highlight variation in the guidelines, thereby providing guidance for future research priorities.

### American association of clinical endocrinology consensus statement: algorithm for management of adults with dyslipidemia-2025 update [^115irgM5]. Endocrine Practice (2025). High credibility.

AACE dyslipidemia — ASCVD risk stratification and initial therapy outline risk categories and actions: Individuals are classified as low (< 7.5%), intermediate (7.5–20%), or high (> 20%) 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk. For low risk, the main treatment is lifestyle intervention that includes diet and physical activity modifications, and pharmacologic lipid management is not recommended. For high risk, pharmacologic therapy should be added to lifestyle interventions, whereas for intermediate risk clinicians should discuss benefits and harms of treatment options. AACE recommends an LDL-C treatment target of < 70 mg/dL for individuals with ASCVD at an increased risk including those with diabetes mellitus. Those at intermediate risk may benefit from additional testing for risk enhancers to aid in shared decision making. Tools and algorithms to estimate ASCVD risk include the Pooled Cohort Equations ASCVD Risk Calculator, the PREVENT Calculator, SCORE2 and SCORE2-OP, and QRISK.

### A critical appraisal of lipid management in the post-statin era: comparison on guidelines, therapeutic targets, and screening in a case-based framework of lipid management [^1142XBF7]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Despite significant advances in the prevention and treatment of ASCVD, it remains a major global cause of morbidity and mortality. Central to ASCVD prevention is effective lipid-lowering, which reduces both the onset of disease and the risk of recurrent cardiovascular events in those with established disease. However, translating these evidence-based strategies into routine clinical practice presents several challenges. Achieving guideline-directed lipid management can be complicated by factors such as patient intolerance, individual variability in response to therapy, and the presence of risk-enhancing factors that are not always neatly addressed by current guidelines.

Moreover, many commonly encountered clinical scenarios — as depicted in the aforementioned case examples — require nuanced, patient-centered approaches that extend beyond standard recommendations. The rapidly evolving landscape of LLTs, including the development of novel agents such as PCSK9 inhibitors, bempedoic acid, and inclisiran, provides clinicians with new tools to tailor treatments, but also necessitates a deeper understanding of when and how to use these therapies effectively. This review has aimed to bridge the gap between guideline-directed care and real-world clinical complexities, offering practical insights into managing patients with challenging lipid disorders. By contextualizing current recommendations and highlighting emerging treatment options, we hope to empower clinicians to make informed, individualized treatment decisions that improve outcomes for their patients. As the field of lipidology continues to evolve, it is crucial that healthcare providers employ both established and emerging therapies to reduce ASCVD risk and enhance patient care.

### 2013 ACC / AHA guideline recommends fixed-dose strategies instead of targeted goals to lower blood cholesterol [^113wVuy7]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

The American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) Task Force on Practice Guidelines recently issued the 2013 ACC/AHA Guideline on the Treatment of Blood Cholesterol to Reduce Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Risk in Adults. This new guideline endorses a paradigm shift in strategies for reducing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events by lowering blood cholesterol. Whereas previous guidelines focused on therapy to decrease low-density lipoprotein and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol to specific target levels, the new guideline instead proposes implementation of cholesterol-lowering treatment using evidenced-based intensity of statin therapy without such targets. The guideline also provides a new risk estimator for primary prevention decisions, including stroke outcomes and data on African Americans, which will significantly increase the number of patients recommended for outcome-related benefits of cholesterol-lowering therapy. The first section of this paper reviews the process by which the task force developed the new evidence-based guideline, the major findings and recommendations, and their implications. The second section primarily focuses on the question of how much low-density lipoprotein cholesterol should be lowered and on additional considerations in risk assessment.

### LDL cholesterol management simplified in adults-lower for longer is better: guidance from the National Lipid Association [^115Uzs9s]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2025). High credibility.

National Lipid Association guidance for adult low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) management — atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) remains the #1 cause of death in the United States, and LDL-C is described as a causal factor that should be monitored and may be modified through lifestyle and pharmacological interventions. The objective is to summarize numerous guidelines and recommendations from leading professional organizations to help clinicians and patients improve evidence-based measurement and management of LDL-C. Methods systematically reviewed guidelines and updates from the American College of Cardiology, American Heart Association, National Lipid Association, and other organizations, and key recommendations were synthesized and translated into a simplified, patient-centered message for clinical application. The synthesis revealed consistent recommendations emphasizing early identification of risk, aggressive lipid lowering in high-risk populations, and shared decision-making to improve adherence; the resulting simplified message aligns with current evidence and is intended to support clinical teams in delivering consistent, guideline-directed care. The conclusion states that integrating major cardiovascular and lipid management guidelines into a unified, simplified message may improve provider clarity and patient understanding, supports team-based care, reduces variation in practice, and enhances implementation of evidence-based strategies to reduce atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk.

### Emerging perspectives on lipid management: international approaches and global challenges [^117USzSe]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2001). Low credibility.

The rapid growth in the understanding of the relation between cholesterol and coronary heart disease has introduced new challenges to the contemporary management of lipid disorders. The publication of the trials of the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme-A inhibitors (statins) has invigorated support for the lipid hypothesis, and many advances have been made in understanding the mechanisms underlying atherosclerosis and the potential benefits of the statins. Several international groups have issued guidelines about desirable and undesirable lipid values to help clinical decision making. Despite the availability of such principles, there are many challenges to optimal management of lipid disorders.

### A lipidologist perspective of global lipid guidelines and recommendations, part 1: lipid treatment targets and risk assessment [^116qKbYT]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Low credibility.

Having knowledge of worldwide lipid guidelines and recommendations may provide clinicians a more global perspective on lipid management. This perspective reviews 8 international scientific and/or medical organizations' lipid guidelines, recommendations, and position papers: the National Lipid Association (2014), National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (2014), International Atherosclerosis Society (2013), American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (2013), Canadian Cardiovascular Society (2013), Japan Atherosclerosis Society (2012), European Society of Cardiology/European Atherosclerosis Society (2012), and Adult Treatment Panel III (2001/2004). Part 1 of this perspective focuses on sentinel components of these lipid guidelines and recommendations as applied to the role of atherogenic lipoprotein cholesterol levels, primary lipid target of therapy, other primary and secondary lipid treatment targets, and assessment of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk. Part 2 examines goals of lipid-altering therapy to reduce ASCVD events. Both parts 1 and 2 include the author's perspective on sentinel topics. In general, some guidelines and recommendations differ with regard to ASCVD risk assessment and lipid treatment goals. However, lipid guidelines and recommendations have significant concordance regarding the need to reduce atherogenic lipoprotein cholesterol levels, and are in general agreement on the primary lipid treatment targets. Finally, a substantial degree of agreement exists among guidelines and recommendations in their emphasis on the need for aggressive treatment of hypercholesterolemia, for which the predominance of ASCVD outcomes studies suggests statins as the first-line treatment of choice.

Conclusion

The safe and optimal treatment of plasma lipids within the secondary prevention population is key to reducing the increasing burden of CVD in society. However, given the paucity of evidence for the frequency of ongoing monitoring, there is a clear need for further research in these two key areas of its management. This will improve patient care while optimising costs in an evidence-based manner.

### Lipid management beyond the guidelines [^116vPDwE]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

The 2018 AHA/ACC cholesterol guideline builds on the 2013 ACC/AHA cholesterol guideline statin recommendations to provide more detailed recommendations for the use of nonstatin therapy risk stratification for primary prevention statin use. New information has become available after the development of the 2018 AHA/ACC cholesterol guideline that can further inform clinical practice. Proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type-9 (PCSK9) monoclonal antibodies are now a reasonable or even good value following over 60% reductions in their acquisition price, and the identification of high risk patient groups most likely to benefit from further low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering. Meta-analyses and clinical trial data now show that patients with LDL-C ≥ 100 mg/dl are more likely to experience progressively greater reductions in the risk of cardiovascular and total mortality and coronary heart disease events for progressively higher LDL-C levels. Icosapent ethyl, a highly concentrated form of modified EPA has been shown to reduce cardiovascular events in high risk patients with moderate hypertriglyceridemia on statin therapy. Comparisons with other statin guidelines revealed that statin initiation for those with ≥ 7.5% 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk is the most effective strategy for reducing the most ASCVD events for the proportion of the population treated. Data from younger populations finally became available for coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring (mean age of 51 years) which confirmed the value of CAC > 0 for identifying individuals at increased ASCVD risk most likely to benefit from statin initiation. This analysis also found that statins could keep CAC = 0 in those with risk factors. Epidemiologic pooling studies now clearly show that LDL-C and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in young adulthood confer excess risk for ASCVD later in life. Accumulating data support earlier risk factor intervention trials as the next research priority.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2013 KDIGO clinical practice guideline for lipid management in CKD [^117Phyau]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2015). Medium credibility.

KDOQI commentary — KDIGO lipid management in chronic kidney disease (CKD) versus ACC/AHA: For individuals aged 50 to 75 years, the KDIGO guideline recommends treating more individuals with statins than the ACC/AHA guideline. The ACC/AHA risk calculator is based on cohort studies and does not include CKD, and many white women with CKD and controlled blood pressure (systolic blood pressure ≤ 140 mm Hg) would not meet the ACC/AHA current threshold of ≥ 7.5% estimated 10-year risk of atherosclerotic CVD, although prior studies have shown that individuals with CKD older than 50 years have on average a predicted risk ≥ 7.5%. In ages 40 to 49 years, ACC/AHA may treat more because the KDIGO threshold is higher (≥ 10% estimated 10-year CHD risk compared to ≥ 7.5% estimated 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular risk in the ACC/AHA guideline), with KDIGO defining CHD as coronary death and nonfatal myocardial infarction, while the ACC/AHA definition of atherosclerotic CVD also includes stroke and peripheral vascular disease. KDIGO does not have an upper age limit, whereas the ACC/AHA guidelines recommend treating individuals older than 75 years with atherosclerotic disease and do not recommend statins for primary prevention due to lack of trial data and validated risk calculators in individuals older than 79 years; for those older than 75 years without atherosclerotic CVD, they recommend weighing patient preferences and the risks and benefits before initiating statin therapy.

### Cholesterol guidelines: more similar than different [^111C7mis]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

A clinician has a large number of guidelines to follow. Searching the words "cardiovascular" and "guideline" on the website, www.guideline.gov yielded 502 cardiovascular guidelines, 40 alone in 2015. 1 [National Guideline Clearinghouse: Agency for Healthcare Research and 19 Quality (n.d.)] Similarly, searching the words "cholesterol" and "guideline" yielded 107 results, 6 alone in 2015. This information overload can decrease providers' self-efficacy in using guidelines, particularly if they have inconsistent messages. Moreover, a busy provider can easily be lost if the emphasis is on highlighting differences rather than similarities on the same topic. There are several guidelines for management of blood cholesterol and lipids. Despite being more similar than different, their similarities have not received as much attention as the differences between them. Unfortunately, there are still major gaps in current clinical practice even across these common themes. In this review, we will provide a brief overview of various cholesterol/lipid guidelines followed by a discussion of the differences but more importantly, similarities between them.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 2 [^112ctU9U]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

Other major guideline documents — older patients: The 2013 ACC/AHA Guideline includes different treatment regimens for individuals > 75 years of age compared to younger persons, recommending moderate intensity statin therapy for secondary prevention in those > 75 years versus high intensity in younger individuals, using the Pooled Cohort Risk Equations and provider–patient discussion for primary prevention without a specific intensity recommendation for those > 75 years. The International Atherosclerosis Society recommends for persons > 65 years the use of short-term (10-year) Framingham risk scoring (recalibrated for country) to estimate CHD risk and elevation of the estimated value by 1/3 to estimate total ASCVD risk, suggesting statins for moderately-high or high estimated risk while considering polypharmacy, drug–drug interactions, and cost. The European Atherosclerosis Society/European Society of Cardiology advocate secondary prevention in the same manner as in younger patients (class I, level of evidence B), starting at low dosage and titrating to the same targets (class I, level of evidence C), and recommend primary prevention for those with 1 or more additional risk factors aside from age (class IIb, level of evidence B). The Canadian Cardiovascular Society recommends statins without specific upper age cutoffs for secondary prevention and, for primary prevention, 10-year Framingham scoring for men ages 40–75 years and for women ages 50–75 years.

### Management of LDL-cholesterol after an acute coronary syndrome: key comparisons of the American and European clinical guidelines to the attention of the healthcare providers [^115NGTSw]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Guidelines for the management of blood cholesterol were updated in the past year in the United States and Europe, reflecting a more intensive approach to lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association task force on practice guideline released the 2018 guideline on the management of blood cholesterol on behalf of several American societies. Approximately 9 months later, the European Society of Cardiology/European Atherosclerosis Society published their 2019 guideline for the management of dyslipidemias. Both guidelines have similarities for the management of patients with acute coronary syndromes. Both emphasize risk assessment of patients as a main approach to guide therapy; those at higher risk of cardiovascular disease have a greater clinical benefit of LDL-C reduction by at least 50%. Both guidelines reinforce the indication to lower LDL-C as an important modifiable risk factor and consider the addition of nonstatin agents, such as ezetimibe and proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors, in addition to lifestyle counseling and high-intensity statin for further reduction of LDL-C levels. However, the guidelines have differences in the concepts of treatment thresholds (≥ 70mg/dL in the United States) vs treatment goals (< 55mg/dL in Europe), in the definition of very high-risk category and in the classes for recommendation for the use of PCSK9 inhibitors.

### 2013 ACC / AHA cholesterol treatment guideline: what was done well and what could be done better [^116VZyqu]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Five years after convening the expert panel, the 2013 ACC/AHA Guideline on the Treatment of Blood Cholesterol to Reduce Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Risk in Adults was released. The American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association issued the guideline on the basis of a systematic review of cholesterol treatment trials performed by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. This report critically appraises the guideline and provides our view of what was done well and what could be done better. In particular, we propose that the guideline succeeds in prioritizing statin therapy, expanding the focus to atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (including stroke), and emphasizing absolute cardiovascular risk to determine eligibility for statin therapy. We contend that the guideline could be enhanced by refining the use of lipid goals rather than removing them, enhancing guidance on evaluation of cholesterol, and broadening the concept of age underpinning risk-based decision making to include vascular and physiological age. We further suggest that the next guideline panel could comprehensively review current best evidence, build on existing guidelines, and cultivate broader national and international consensus. Overall, we aim to continue discussions about the important contributions and shortfalls of the guideline and create momentum for effective implementation and timely updates.

Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for dyslipidemia, more specifically with respect to statins, AAPA/ABC/ACC/ACPM/ADA/AGS/AHA/APhA/ASPC/PCNA 2019 guidelines recommend to administer a moderate-intensity statin in intermediate-risk adult patients if a decision is made for statin therapy in the context of a risk discussion, as statin therapy reduces the risk of ASCVD.

Figure 2
Overview of Triglyceride Management Adapted From the 2022 Expert Consensus Decision Pathway on the Management of ASCVD Risk Reduction in Patients With Persistent Hypertriglyceridemia

Used with permission of the publisher. ASCVD = atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease; TG = triglycerides.

Although this patient's triglycerides are the primary concern, his LDL-C is well below 100 mg/dL, which may reduce the urgency for statin therapy. However, if triglycerides remain elevated and the patient's ASCVD risk increases (ie, a 10-year risk ≥ 5% or a diagnosis of diabetes), statin therapy should be initiated or intensified and would likely provide the greatest benefit for ASCVD risk reduction. In such cases, statins are recommended to target appropriate LDL-C or non-HDL-C thresholds, as they offer protection against both cardiovascular events and further elevations in triglycerides. In the setting of hypertriglyceridemia, LDL-C calculations may be less accurate (especially if the older Friedewald calculation is used), and a more accurate assessment of atherogenic risk may require the usage of non-HDL-C and/or ApoB to help decide on the intensity of lipid lowering. In these cases, it is important to emphasize the role of non-HDL-C and/or ApoB as elevations in either should prompt consideration of statin therapy prior to triglyceride-specific lowering agents such as omega-3 fatty acids or fibrates.

### Integrated guidance on the care of familial hypercholesterolemia from the international FH foundation [^1151yMLd]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2014). Low credibility.

Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a dominantly inherited disorder present from birth that markedly elevates plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and causes premature coronary heart disease. There are at least 20 million people with FH worldwide, but the majority remains undetected, and current treatment is often suboptimal. To address this major gap in coronary prevention we present, from an international perspective, consensus-based guidance on the care of FH. The guidance was generated from seminars and workshops held at an international symposium. The recommendations focus on the detection, diagnosis, assessment, and management of FH in adults and children and set guidelines for clinical purposes. They also refer to best practice for cascade screening and risk notifying and testing families for FH, including use of genetic testing. Guidance on treatment is based on risk stratification, management of noncholesterol risk factors, and the safe and effective use of low-density lipoprotein-lowering therapies. Recommendations are given on lipoprotein apheresis. The use of emerging therapies for FH is also foreshadowed. This international guidance acknowledges evidence gaps but aims to make the best use of contemporary practice and technology to achieve the best outcomes for the care of FH. It should accordingly be used to inform clinical judgment and be adjusted for country-specific and local healthcare needs and resources.

### Statins for all? [^116p6how]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Recent guidelines for cholesterol management proposed by the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and American Heart Association (AHA) recommended statin therapy for most men in their 60s and most women in their 70s. If these guidelines are followed in the United States, most adults will eventually take statins. A companion article in this journal goes a step further by proposing statin initiation for mostly everyone about 10 years earlier. Treatment in ACC/AHA guidelines does not depend on cholesterol levels, for either statin initiation or treatment goals. Selection of patients for statin therapy depends instead on multifactorial risk assessment derived from prospective studies in subgroups of the US population. Because of expansion of statin therapy, the issue of the reliability of risk assessment has come to the fore. Some evidence suggests that the ACC/AHA risk algorithm overestimates risk in many persons; if so, this would lead to statin therapy beyond what was intended. Some investigators favor assessment of risk based on presence or absence of categorical risk factors or higher risk conditions. Others propose selection of individuals for statin therapy grounded in measurement of atherosclerosis burden. Finally, an alternate approach to cholesterol management is to establish cholesterol goals for secondary and primary prevention. Cholesterol levels, and not global risk assessment, here define the intensity of therapy. The use of cholesterol goals allows more flexibility in treatment by taking advantage of lifestyle therapies and various drugs and their doses to attain defined goals.

### Triglycerides: a reappraisal [^1131cjfw]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Elevated cholesterol levels are clearly independently associated with adverse cardiovascular events. Another class of lipid particles, triglycerides, is also abundant in the human body and has been found in atherosclerotic plaques. Recent observational studies have demonstrated an association between elevated triglyceride levels and increased risk for future cardiovascular events. With this knowledge and the discovery of effective agents to lower triglyceride levels, the management of triglycerides is currently undergoing a renaissance. Unfortunately, no randomized, controlled clinical trials have been completed to date, proving that lowering triglycerides will reduce cardiovascular events. In this review we highlight some of the evidence that led to this stage and discuss the current data on pharmacologic intervention of triglyceride levels and the effect on clinical outcomes. Lastly, we want to give the reader insight on what the most recent lipid guidelines state about clinical triglyceride management, mention new pharmacological agents, and highlight the clinical evidence for safe and effective lowering of triglycerides levels with life style modification.

### Design and rationale for the patient and provider assessment of lipid management (PALM) registry [^111iTHfz]. American Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Despite improvements in diagnosis and treatment, the prevalence of hyperlipidemia among adults in the United States remains high. Data are limited on treatment patterns and patient perceptions of cardiovascular disease risk since the release of new lipid guidelines.

Objectives

The objectives of the PALM registry are to assess contemporary patterns of lipid-lowering therapy use among adults receiving care in a nationally representative cohort of community clinics, determine consistency of treatment with varying lipid guidelines, identify factors affecting use of lipid-lowering therapy including patient-reported statin intolerance, and assess patient and provider knowledge of cardiovascular risk reduction goals.

Study Design

The PALM registry will enroll 7,500 patients likely to be considered for lipid-lowering therapy from 175 cardiology, primary care, and endocrinology practices across the United States. In this cross-sectional, observational registry, a novel tablet-based platform will be used to collect patient-reported knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs regarding cardiovascular risk reduction and lipid management. Chart abstraction and core laboratory lipid levels will describe current lipid management. Provider surveys will assess perception of current lipid-lowering goals and barriers to optimal cardiovascular risk reduction.

Conclusion

The PALM registry will allow for better understanding of current practice patterns, patient experiences, and patient and provider attitudes toward cholesterol management for cardiovascular disease risk reduction. These data can be used to better understand gaps in care and design targeted interventions to improve uptake of lipid-lowering therapies for cardiovascular risk reduction.

### Cholesterol management: ACC / AHA updates guideline… [^114mpP3Y]. AAFP (2019). Medium credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- A nonfasting plasma lipid profile can be obtained to estimate ASCVD risk and document baseline LDL-C in adults 20 years and older who are not on lipid-lowering therapy.
- Maximally tolerated statin therapy is recommended for patients 20 to 75 years of age with an LDL-C level of 190 mg per dL or greater.
- Moderate-intensity statin therapy should be initiated without calculating a 10-year ASCVD risk for patients 40 to 75 years of age with diabetes mellitus.
- Patients without diabetes at intermediate risk of ASCVD with LDL-C levels of 70 to 189 mg per dL should be treated with a moderate-intensity statin for a goal of 30% or greater reduction in LDL-C levels. The updated guideline also includes recommendations for nonstatin lipid-lowering agents that can be used as statin add-ons to meet recommended LDL-C thresholds. A cornerstone of the guideline is to emphasize a heart-healthy lifestyle for all patients.

A healthy lifestyle reduces ASCVD risk at all ages and can reduce the development of risk factors in younger patients. SECONDARY PREVENTION Based on high-quality evidence from randomized controlled trials, high-intensity statin therapy should be instituted with a goal of lowering LDL-C levels by 50% or more in patients with ASCVD up to 75 years of age. If treatment is not tolerated, then moderate-intensity therapy should be used with a goal of achieving a 30% to 49% reduction in LDL-C levels. High-quality evidence from RCTs recommends that patients 40 to 75 years of age without diabetes who are at intermediate risk with LDL-C levels of 70 to 189 mg per dL should be treated with a moderate-intensity statin. A 30% or greater reduction in LDL-C levels is recommended, and in high-risk patients a 50% or greater reduction is recommended. level of 130 mg per dL or greater, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein level of 2. 0 mg per L or greater, an ankle-brachial index less than
0. 9, and lipoprotein level of 50 mg per dL or greater, especially at higher values of lipoprotein.

### Guidelines for the management of hyperlipidemia: how can clinicians effectively implement them? [^113tgunW]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Guidelines support lowering cholesterol to decrease atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk across the entire lifespan with intensive lifestyle intervention, as well as statin and non-statin pharmacotherapy for those at highest risk. Modest improvements in the initiation, use, and adherence to statin therapy in patients with ASCVD have occurred over the past decades. However, studies continue to document a less than desired implementation of guidelines highlighting a substantial and persistent treatment gap. The success of implementation depends on the consideration of a variety of barriers that exist throughout the healthcare delivery system. Further research is needed to comprehensively evaluate these barriers in order to develop appropriate and sustainable interventions to improve guideline implementation.

### Lipid disorders: justification of methods and goals of treatment [^1131nWts]. Chest (2001). Low credibility.

Dyslipidemia is a major risk factor for coronary heart disease (CHD). While some uncertainty exists about the clinical significance of improving high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglyceride levels, large primary- and secondary-prevention studies aimed at lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels with statins have convincingly reduced CHD events and total mortality. Despite the strong clinical evidence and widely publicized treatment guidelines, many hyperlipidemic patients receive inadequate lipid-lowering treatment. This failure to achieve clinical treatment goals may be due to poor physician adherence to treatment guidelines, patient noncompliance, and the presence of concomitant medical conditions that modify typical hyperlipidemia management. This review considers the challenges and available strategies to optimize lipid management in patients at risk for CHD.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2023). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for coronary artery disease, more specifically with respect to lipid-lowering therapy, ACC/ACCP/AHA/ASPC/NLA/PCNA 2023 guidelines recommend to initiate moderate-intensity statin therapy with the aim of achieving a 30–49% reduction in LDL-C levels to reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events if high-intensity statin therapy is contraindicated or not tolerated.
