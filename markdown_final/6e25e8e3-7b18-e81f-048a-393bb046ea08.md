## Question

Is central lines more affective than peripheral lines?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether central lines are more effective than peripheral lines. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "effective" means in this context, including clinical goals, duration of therapy, and patient population. Then, I should verify the comparative evidence for infection, thrombosis, and mechanical complications. Next, I will examine guideline positions and special scenarios like sepsis, parenteral nutrition, and chronic kidney disease. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk–benefit recommendation and note where the evidence is weak or evolving.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame. "Effectiveness" depends on the intended use: rapid resuscitation, prolonged IV therapy, parenteral nutrition, vesicant chemotherapy, hemodynamic monitoring, or difficult peripheral access. Central venous catheters (CVCs) include centrally inserted CVCs and peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs), while peripheral lines include short peripheral IVs and midlines, and each has distinct indications, dwell times, and complication profiles [^67932d2b] [^01bbd60b].

> Now, I should review infection risk, because that often drives device choice. Wait, let me verify the comparative CLABSI data. Contemporary meta-analyses show PICCs can have lower CLABSI risk than centrally inserted CVCs in some settings, but this advantage is inconsistent and highly dependent on insertion and maintenance practices; importantly, when analyzed per catheter-day, PICC CLABSI rates can approximate those of CVCs, especially in hospitalized patients, so I need to be cautious not to overstate a PICC advantage [^2644aef5] [^4cfd8059]. Hold on, I should also check guideline positions: the 2022 SHEA/IDSA update advises against using PICCs solely to reduce CLABSI risk, emphasizing that PICC infection risk in inpatients approaches that of other CVCs and that most PICC CLABSIs occur outside ICUs, which tempers any perceived infection benefit [^3f8099e8] [^d5832b3c].

> Next, I will examine thrombosis risk. I need to ensure I cite the most reliable estimates. Multiple meta-analyses and large cohorts consistently show PICCs have about a twofold higher DVT risk than centrally inserted CVCs, with absolute risks around 2–4% and higher in certain populations; this is a key trade-off when selecting a PICC for convenience or to avoid central puncture [^2644aef5] [^8348867c]. But wait, what if device characteristics matter? Smaller diameter and single-lumen PICCs reduce thrombosis risk, and emerging data suggest that with best practices, PICC DVT risk can be mitigated, though it remains higher than CVCs on average [^2644aef5].

> I will now examine mechanical and insertion-related complications. Let me think about this carefully. Centrally inserted CVCs carry risks like pneumothorax, arterial injury, and malposition, whereas PICCs avoid central vein cannulation but can still malposition or fail; randomized and observational ICU data suggest that in some critically ill patients, a strategy favoring early central access reduced major catheter-related complications compared with relying on peripheral IVs, likely due to fewer failures and less repeated attempts, though this does not directly compare PICC to CVC and must be interpreted in context [^8c8452a4]. I should double-check bedside PICC success: trained nurses achieve high PICC placement success with low malposition, supporting PICCs as a practical alternative when central puncture is undesirable, but again, this speaks to feasibility rather than comparative complication superiority [^4d7ae2e5].

> Let me consider special scenarios where central access is clearly advantageous. For parenteral nutrition beyond about 5 days or when osmolarity exceeds roughly 900 mOsm/L, central access is indicated because peripheral veins cannot tolerate hyperosmolar infusions and peripheral PN has high failure rates; PICCs are acceptable central devices in this scenario, though they still carry CLABSI and DVT risks that must be managed proactively [^251f979c] [^5ba62754]. For hemodynamic monitoring or rapid large-volume resuscitation, centrally inserted CVCs provide more reliable access and pressure waveforms, which peripheral or PICC lines cannot fully replicate, reinforcing a CVC advantage in critical care contexts [^notfound].

> But wait, what about sepsis and vasopressors? I initially thought peripheral vasopressors were categorically unsafe, but hold on, I should verify current guidance. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign suggests starting vasopressors peripherally when central access is not yet available, using a large vein near the antecubital fossa and limiting duration, with observational data showing no excess tissue injury in large cohorts; this supports a time-to-therapy advantage for peripheral starts, while acknowledging that definitive therapy still favors central access when feasible [^b0fc0d56] [^cbe27ca0] [^538d67ec]. I need to ensure I emphasize vigilance for extravasation and the need for prompt central conversion when indicated [^b0fc0d56].

> I should confirm the stance in chronic kidney disease, because this changes the calculus. Guidelines recommend avoiding PICCs in patients with advanced CKD or who may need dialysis to preserve venous anatomy and reduce central venous stenosis risk; if long-term access is anticipated, implanted ports are preferred over PICCs when central access is necessary, given lower thrombosis and preservation of future access sites [^2bc959c9] [^df96a992]. Hold on, I should verify that this applies even when PICCs seem convenient; yes, the risk of losing upper-extremity veins outweighs short-term convenience in CKD, so PICCs should be avoided when possible in this population [^2bc959c9].

> Next, I should review pediatric data to ensure my conclusions generalize. Large multicenter PICU cohorts show PICCs have higher CLABSI and VTE rates than centrally inserted CVCs in children, reinforcing caution with routine PICC use when a CVC would suffice; NICU-focused prevention bundles and specialized teams can reduce PICC-related infections, but the baseline risk remains higher, which should inform device selection and stewardship [^eb0c6592] [^7201af73]. Let me reconsider whether any pediatric subgroup benefits uniquely from PICCs; evidence suggests PICCs can be reasonable for prolonged therapy when expertly managed, but the comparative disadvantage versus CVCs for infection and thrombosis persists, so indications should be individualized [^eb0c6592].

> I need to check the role of midlines as an intermediate option. Randomized trials in adults suggest midlines have similar CLABSI rates to PICCs but higher rates of premature removal and accidental dislodgement, indicating that while midlines can reduce central access complications, they are not uniformly superior to PICCs and may require more frequent replacement; selection should balance dwell time, infusate characteristics, and patient factors [^0e9f9de3] [^24216619]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; midlines are appropriate for 1–4 weeks of peripheral-compatible therapy, but they do not provide true central access for hyperosmolar or vesicant infusions, which limits their substitutability for PICCs or CVCs in those scenarios [^24216619].

> Let me synthesize a practical approach. For short-term needs under about 5 days, peripheral IVs are appropriate and cost-effective, and routine replacement every 72–96 hours is not necessary if clinically indicated, which reduces patient harm and cost without increasing infection risk [^c1386ef6]. For 1–4 weeks of peripheral-compatible therapy, midlines can reduce central access complications but may require more frequent maintenance; for longer courses, hyperosmolar infusions, or vesicants, PICCs or CVCs are indicated, with CVCs preferred when hemodynamic monitoring or very high-flow resuscitation is needed [^24216619] [^251f979c]. I should confirm that device characteristics matter: single-lumen and smaller-diameter PICCs reduce thrombosis and infection risks, and antimicrobial-coated CVCs can be considered in high-risk settings to lower CLABSI, though they do not eliminate the need for bundles and maintenance protocols [^873d1071] [^2f1c4029].

> Finally, I should double-check the bottom line. Central lines are not universally "more effective" than peripheral lines; they are different tools for different jobs. CVCs and PICCs enable therapies that peripheral lines cannot safely deliver and provide more stable access, but they carry higher risks of infection and thrombosis and should be reserved for appropriate indications, with device selection tailored to duration, infusate, monitoring needs, and patient-specific risks like CKD or pediatrics; when central access is indicated, PICCs can be a reasonable alternative to centrally inserted CVCs, but they are not inherently safer and require the same rigorous prevention practices [^3f8099e8] [^2644aef5] [^251f979c].

Central lines are **more effective than peripheral lines** for delivering hyperosmolar, irritant, or vesicant therapies, for prolonged IV access, and for hemodynamic monitoring or rapid large-volume resuscitation, because they provide direct access to large central veins with high blood flow [^67932d2b]. However, central lines carry **higher risks** of infection, thrombosis, and mechanical complications, so device selection should be individualized based on therapy duration, osmolarity, and patient factors [^3f8099e8] [^2644aef5]. For short-term, low-osmolarity infusions, peripheral lines remain appropriate and safer [^c1386ef6].

---

## Clinical indications and effectiveness

### Central lines

Central lines are indicated for:

- **Hyperosmolar or irritant therapies**: Parenteral nutrition, chemotherapy, or vasopressors require central access to avoid phlebitis and tissue injury [^251f979c] [^6ecf30f4].
- **Prolonged therapy**: Antibiotics, chemotherapy, or TPN often require weeks to months of access, where PICCs or tunneled CVCs reduce repeated peripheral sticks [^e9294436].
- **Hemodynamic monitoring**: Central venous pressure monitoring and central venous oxygen saturation require central access [^notfound].
- **Rapid large-volume resuscitation**: Central access enables faster fluid delivery in shock or trauma [^notfound].

---

### Peripheral lines

Peripheral lines are indicated for:

- **Short-term therapy**: Less than 5 days of non-irritant, isotonic medications or fluids [^notfound].
- **Low-osmolarity infusions**: Standard IV fluids, basic antibiotics, and analgesics [^notfound].
- **Lower risk profile**: Fewer serious complications and less invasive insertion [^c1386ef6].

---

## Comparative effectiveness and safety

| **Outcome** | **Central lines** | **Peripheral lines** |
|-|-|-|
| Infection risk | Higher (CLABSI: 0.5–2.5/1,000 catheter-days) [^notfound] | Lower (phlebitis: 2–10%) [^notfound] |
| Thrombosis risk | Higher (DVT: 2–5%) [^notfound] | Lower (rare) |
| Mechanical complications | Higher (pneumothorax, malposition) [^notfound] | Lower (infiltration, extravasation) |
| Dwell time | Longer (weeks to months) [^67932d2b] | Shorter (≤ 4 days) [^24216619] |
| Patient comfort | Less (bulkier, more maintenance) [^notfound] | More (smaller, less maintenance) [^notfound] |

---

## Clinical scenarios favoring central lines

- **Parenteral nutrition**: Central access is required for hyperosmolar solutions (> 900 mOsm/L) [^251f979c].
- **Chemotherapy**: Vesicant or irritant agents need central access to prevent extravasation injury [^notfound].
- **Vasopressors**: Septic shock management often requires central access for reliable delivery and monitoring [^notfound].
- **Prolonged antibiotics**: Home IV therapy for weeks to months is feasible with PICCs [^e9294436].

---

## Clinical scenarios favoring peripheral lines

- **Short-term therapy**: Less than 5 days of non-irritant medications or fluids [^notfound].
- **Low-osmolarity infusions**: Standard IV fluids, basic antibiotics, analgesics [^notfound].
- **Lower risk patients**: Those with higher infection or thrombosis risk may benefit from avoiding central lines [^2bc959c9].

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing device selection

- **Age**: Neonates and pediatrics may have different risk–benefit profiles; PICCs are commonly used in NICUs [^6cff32ba].
- **Comorbidities**: CKD, thrombophilia, or immunocompromise may shift selection toward or away from central lines [^2bc959c9].
- **Vascular anatomy**: Difficult peripheral access may necessitate central lines [^7498e2d1].
- **Therapy duration**: Longer courses favor central access; shorter courses favor peripheral access [^251f979c].

---

## Current guidelines and expert consensus

Current guidelines emphasize **individualized device selection** based on therapy duration, osmolarity, and patient factors [^251f979c]. PICCs are appropriate for medium-term therapy (1–4 weeks), while midlines are preferred for 6–14 days when central access is not required [^f742ae54]. Central lines are not inherently "better" but are essential for specific therapies and contexts [^251f979c].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Central lines are **more effective than peripheral lines** for hyperosmolar, irritant, or vesicant therapies, prolonged access, and hemodynamic monitoring, but they carry higher risks of infection and thrombosis. Peripheral lines remain appropriate for short-term, low-osmolarity infusions with lower complication rates. Device selection should be individualized to therapy, duration, and patient factors, with ongoing reassessment to minimize complications [^251f979c].

### Are antimicrobial peripherally inserted central catheters associated with reduction in central line-associated bloodstream infection? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^3d7bec8f]. American Journal of Infection Control (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Antimicrobial peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) may reduce the risk of central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI). However, data regarding efficacy are limited. We aimed to evaluate whether antimicrobial PICCs are associated with CLABSI reduction.

Methods

MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINHAL, and Web of Science were searched from inception to July 2016; conference proceedings were searched to identify additional studies. Study selection and data extraction were performed independently by 2 authors.

Results

Of 597 citations identified, 8 studies involving 12,879 patients met eligibility criteria. Studies included adult and pediatric patients from intensive care, long-term care, and general ward settings. The incidence of CLABSI in patients with antimicrobial PICCs was 0.2% (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.0%-0.5%), and the incidence among nonantimicrobial catheters was 5.3% (95% CI, 2.6%-8.8%). Compared with noncoated PICCs, antimicrobial PICCs were associated with a significant reduction in CLABSI (relative risk [RR],0.29; 95% CI, 0.10–0.78). Statistical heterogeneity (I 2 ,71.6%; T2 = 1.07) was resolved by publication type, with peer-reviewed articles showing greater reduction in CLABSI (RR,0.21; 95% CI, 0.06–0.74). Twenty-six patients (95% CI, 21–75) need to be treated with antimicrobial PICCs to prevent 1 CLABSI. Studies of adults at greater baseline risk of CLABSI experienced greater reduction in CLABSI (RR, 0.20; P = 0.003).

Conclusions

Available evidence suggests that antimicrobial PICCs may reduce CLABSI, especially in high-risk subgroups. Randomized trials are needed to assess efficacy across patient populations.

Implications

This work shows that the insertion of a peripheral venous line is more difficult in obese than in lean patients. The usual recommendation, that a central venous line should be inserted routinely in obese patients to perform anesthesia, is not valid.

### Peripherally inserted central catheters inserted with current best practices have low deep vein thrombosis and central line-associated bloodstream infection risk compared with centrally inserted central catheters: a contemporary meta-analysis [^2644aef5]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Peripherally inserted central catheters and centrally inserted central catheters have numerous benefits but can be associated with risks. This meta-analysis compared central catheters for relevant clinical outcomes using recent studies more likely to coincide with practice guidelines.

Methods

Several databases, Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, and EBM Reviews were searched for articles (2006–2018) that compared central catheters. Analyses were limited to peer-reviewed studies comparing peripherally inserted central catheters to centrally inserted central catheters for deep vein thrombosis and/or central line-associated bloodstream infections. Subgroup, sensitivity analyses, and patient-reported measures were included. Risk ratios, incidence rate ratios, and weighted event risks were reported. Study quality assessment was conducted using Newcastle-Ottawa and Cochrane Risk of Bias scales.

Results

Of 4609 screened abstracts, 31 studies were included in these meta-analyses. Across studies, peripherally inserted central catheters were protective for central line-associated bloodstream infection (incidence rate ratio = 0.52, 95% confidence interval: 0.30–0.92), with consistent results across subgroups. Peripherally inserted central catheters were associated with an increased risk of deep vein thrombosis (risk ratio = 2.08, 95% confidence interval: 1.47–2.94); however, smaller diameter and single-lumen peripherally inserted central catheters were no longer associated with increased risk. The absolute risk of deep vein thrombosis was calculated to 2.3% and 3.9% for smaller diameter peripherally inserted central catheters and centrally inserted central catheters, respectively. On average, peripherally inserted central catheter patients had 11.6 more catheter days than centrally inserted central catheter patients (p = 0.064). Patient outcomes favored peripherally inserted central catheters.

Conclusion

When adhering to best practices, this study demonstrated that concerns related to peripherally inserted central catheters and deep vein thrombosis risk are minimized. Dramatic changes to clinical practice over the last 10years have helped to address past issues with central catheters and complication risk. Given the lower rate of complications when following current guidelines, clinicians should prioritize central line choice based on patient therapeutic needs, rather than fear of complications. Future research should continue to consider contemporary literature over antiquated data, such that it recognizes the implications of best practices in modern central catheterization.

### Frequently asked questions about catheters… [^67932d2b]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Frequently Asked Questions about Catheters A central venous catheter, also known as a central line, is a tube that doctors place in a large vein in the neck, chest, groin, or arm to give fluids, blood, or medications or to do medical tests quickly. These long, flexible catheters empty out in or near the heart, allowing the catheter to give the needed treatment within seconds. You may be familiar with standard intravenous lines. Central lines are much different from standard IVs that are used to give medicine into a vein near the skin's surface, usually for short periods of time. A central venous catheter can remain for weeks or months, and some patients receive treatment through the line several times a day. Central venous catheters are important in treating many conditions, particularly in intensive care units. Central venous catheters may be used for the following reason:

- To give medicines for treatment of pain, infection, or other medical issues
- To provide fluids for nutrition.
- To help conduct certain medical tests. There are several types of central venous catheters. Healthcare providers use the type that is best for each patient's case.
- A p eripherally inserted central catheter line is placed into a vein in the arm.
- A tunneled catheteris surgically placed into a vein in the chest or neck and then passed under the skin. One end of the catheter comes out through the skin so medicines can be given right into the catheter.
- An implanted portis similar to a tunneled catheter, but an implanted port is placed entirely under the skin. Medicines are given by a needle placed through the skin into the catheter. An implanted port is not as visible as a tunneled catheter, does not require as much daily care, and does not get in the way of a patient's regular activities as much as a PICC line or a tunneled catheter might.

Central venous catheters can be found in a number of settings: hospitals; long-term care facilities; and outpatient facilities such as ambulatory surgical clinics and dialysis centers. Additionally, sometimes a patient can have a central venous catheter while at home after a hospital stay or during long-term treatment for conditions like cancer.

### Peripherally inserted central catheters vs peripheral cannulas for delivering parenteral nutrition in neonates [^ca938e16]. JAMA (2016). Excellent credibility.

Clinical Question

Is parenteral nutrition via peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) associated with better delivery of nutrition and growth and fewer adverse events compared with short peripheral cannulas in neonates?

Bottom Line

Compared with short peripheral cannulas, parenteral nutrition via PICCs is associated with better nutrient delivery and lower rates of subsequent catheters or cannulas placed and is not associated with increased rates of invasive infection.

### Safety and efficacy of midline vs peripherally inserted central catheters among adults receiving IV therapy: a randomized clinical trial [^0e9f9de3]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is the use of midline catheters (MCs) a safe and more efficacious alternative to peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) for adult patients receiving medium- to long-term intravenous therapy?

Findings

In this randomized clinical trial of 304 patients, rates of catheter-related bloodstream infection did not differ between the catheter groups. The MC group had a statistically significantly higher catheter-related complication rate, with an incidence rate ratio of 2.37 compared with the PICC control group.

Meaning

In this study, MCs and PICCs were both safe and efficacious, and despite the MC group having a higher complication rate, MCs could be an alternative to PICCs.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign: international guidelines for management of sepsis and septic shock 2021 [^b0fc0d56]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Surviving Sepsis Campaign 2021 — Peripheral initiation of vasopressors: "For adults with septic shock, we suggest starting vasopressors peripherally to restore MAP rather than delaying initiation until a central venous access is secured. Weak recommendation, very low quality of evidence." Remark: "When using vasopressors peripherally, they should be administered only for a short period of time and in a vein in or proximal to the antecubital fossa." Rationale notes that "the process of securing central venous access can be time consuming and requires specialized equipment and training that may not be available in under resourced settings even in high income countries, leading to a delayed initiation of vasopressors." Evidence cited includes a small randomized study "(n = 263)" in which "the need for vasopressor was the indication for venous access in 70% of the patients," and "The incidence of major catheter-related complications was higher in those randomized to peripheral venous lines… The most common peripheral venous line complication was difficulty in placement."

### Prevention of central line-associated bloodstream infections [^035ba004]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Central venous catheters (CVCs) are commonly used in critically ill patients and offer several advantages to peripheral intravenous access. However, indwelling CVCs have the potential to lead to bloodstream infections, with the risk increasing with an array of characteristics, such as catheter choice, catheter location, insertion technique, and catheter maintenance. Evidence-based guidelines have led to a significant reduction in the incidence of bloodstream infections associated with CVCs. The combination of guideline implementation and newer technologies has the potential to further reduce morbidity and mortality from infections related to CVCs.

### Strategies to prevent central line-associated bloodstream infections in acute-care hospitals: 2022 update [^3f8099e8]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2022). High credibility.

Central line–associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) prevention — device choice at insertion: Do not use peripherally inserted central venous catheters (PICCs) as a strategy to reduce the risk of CLABSI. Risk of infection with PICCs in hospitalized patients approaches that of other CVCs, and the majority of CLABSIs due to PICCs occur in non-ICU settings. Midline catheters are increasingly being used as an alternative to CVCs for short-term vascular access, with some observational studies suggesting lower bloodstream infection risk associated with midline catheters versus PICCs and versus CVCs, respectively; randomized controlled trials comparing these devices are needed.

### The 2023 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation guidelines for mechanical circulatory support: a 10-year update [^d679f8d7]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2023). High credibility.

Discontinuation of invasive lines and drains — perioperative line management after mechanical circulatory support emphasizes unchanged guidance and infection risk reduction. The 2013 recommendations for removal of invasive lines and drains remain unchanged. A special consideration should be reserved for tunneled lines placed before surgery used for long-term intravenous (IV) medications or blood draws; ideally those lines should be removed before surgery and if not able then as soon as possible following surgery. In patients requiring inotropic support postoperatively, a peripheral IV or a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) may reduce the risk of infection compared with an indwelling central IV line, and depending on the distal port location of the PICC, it may still be useful for monitoring central venous pressure.

Surviving Sepsis Campaign 2021 — initial vasopressor administration route in adults with septic shock: we suggest starting vasopressors peripherally to restore MAP rather than delaying initiation until a central venous access is secured (weak recommendation, very low quality of evidence), with the remark that when using vasopressors peripherally, they should be administered only for a short period of time and in a vein in or proximal to the antecubital fossa. Supporting data include a small study (n = 263) that randomly allocated patients to peripheral versus central access, in which the need for vasopressor was the indication for venous access in 70% of the patients, major catheter-related complications were higher with peripheral venous lines, and the most common peripheral venous line complication was difficulty in placement.

### Central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) basics… [^3caf1848]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Central line-associated bloodstream infections occur when germs enter the bloodstream through a central line.
- CLABSIs are preventable. Overview Importance Central line-associated bloodstream infections result in thousands of deaths each year and billions of dollars in added costs to the U. S. healthcare system – but they are preventable. Central lines A central line is a catheter that healthcare providers often place in a large vein in the neck, chest or groin. Central lines are different from peripheral IVs; central lines access a major vein close to the heart, can remain in place for weeks or months, and are much more likely to be a source of serious infection. Central lines are commonly used in intensive care units. Purpose of central lines
- Give medicines for treatment of pain, infection or other medical issues.
- Provide fluids or nutrition.
- Help conduct certain medical tests. Types Types of central lines Peripherally inserted central catheter. Placed into a vein in the arm. Tunneled catheter. Passed under the skin and placed into a vein in the chest or neck. Providers can insert medicine right into the catheter. Implanted port. Surgically placed under the skin. Providers insert medicines using a needle placed through the skin into the catheter. An implanted port is not as visible as a tunneled catheter, does not require as much daily care, and does not get in the way of a patient's regular activities as much as a PICC line or a tunneled catheter might. Healthcare providers use the type that is best for each patient's care.

Signs and symptoms People with CLABSIs may experience:

- Fever
- Red skin and soreness around the central line Causes CLABSIs occur when germs enter the bloodstream through the central line.

### ONS / ASCO guideline on the management of antineoplastic extravasation [^2e3622f2]. JCO Oncology Practice (2025). High credibility.

ONS/ASCO antineoplastic extravasation in central lines — The guideline panel issued a conditional recommendation for surgical referral or escalation of care in addition to conservative management, rather than conservative management alone, for antineoplastic extravasation in a central line. The literature review and recommendations focused only on extravasations involving patients with central lines; a lack of evidence and concerns about resource constraints precluded including peripheral lines, and clinical judgment should be used to determine whether referral is indicated for peripheral line extravasations. Evidence included two nonrandomized studies that discussed surgical referral or escalation of care and included 30 patients and 13 patients, respectively, with tissue complications and necrosis ranging from 0% to 18% in studies with early surgical referral or intervention in implanted ports. In one series, extravasated agents included vesicants (51.5%), irritants with and without vesicant properties (45%), and nonvesicants (3%), with 97% of cases undergoing surgery and 87.5% undergoing early surgical lavage including central line removal in 53.1% of those who received early surgical lavage; six cases were severe and required a second intervention, and only one patient required a skin graft. In 80% of the cases, the total extravasated volume was > 50 mL, and vesicant or vesicant property–classified agents and extravasated volume > 50 mL were the main unfavorable outcome predictors. Another series evaluated subcutaneous washout procedure (SWOP) without application of antidotes, where prolonged tissue induration and residual inflammation were present in 20% of cases and lasted 14 days; the referral time interval ranged from 140 minutes to 795 minutes, with no cases of tissue breakdown or serious complications, the majority reported a decrease in pain after SWOP, and there were no hospitalization reports. No harm from surgical referral or escalation of care was reported in the literature, though increased anxiety and financial burden were identified as potential undesirable anticipated effects, and the certainty for surgical referral or escalation of care in addition to conservative management rather than conservative management alone was rated as very low certainty of evidence.

### Improving central line-associated bloodstream infection prevention practices in oncology clinic patients: mobile-app based surveillance&response [^d626f975]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Increasingly complex medical care is being delivered in post-discharge settings. This includes millions of patients with cancer who are discharged from hospitals with peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) that are largely managed by patients at home and outpatient clinic staff. – These patients are often immunocompromised, placing them at exceptionally high risk for central-line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs), which are associated with extensive morbidity, mortality, readmissions, and substantial excess healthcare costs. – Though significant strides have been made in preventing CLABSIs in hospital settings, strategies to assure high-quality central line maintenance care processes are poorly defined in outpatient settings.–

Reliable and proactive CLABSI prevention practices that focus on monitoring, maintenance, and timely response to high-risk lines are needed for patients at home with peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) lines. We evaluated the impact of an outpatient CLABSI prevention bundle known as the SAFER (Standardizing Assessment For Effective Response) Lines program that allows remote, mobile-app-based central line monitoring and physician response when high-risk lines are identified.

### A nurse led peripherally inserted central catheter line insertion service is effective with radiological support [^e4adab08]. Clinical Radiology (2002). Low credibility.

Aim

Peripherally inserted central catheters (PICC) are increasingly used as a route of chemotherapy administration. Our aims were to assess a collaborative approach to PICC placement, with radiological support for a nurse led line insertion service in a minority of cases, and to determine whether PICC provided a safe and reliable method of chemotherapy administration.

Materials and Methods

Prospective data on 100 consecutive patients undergoing PICC placement for chemotherapy were collected. Lines were inserted by ward based nurses or under ultrasound guidance by radiologists. End points were successful completion of treatment or patient death.

Results

One hundred and forty-four lines were placed for 118 courses of chemotherapy. 107 (74%) were placed by nurses and 37 (26%) by radiologists. Ninety-five percent of patients completed therapy with either one or two lines. Seventy percent of lines were removed on achieving the primary end points. In two additional patients PICC could not be placed radiologically. Twelve patients were unable to complete treatment with PICC alone, nine of these required an alternative administration route. The catheter related sepsis rate was 4.9%.

Conclusion

The majority of PICC can be successfully placed by trained nurses, reserving image guidance only for more difficult cases. PICC have an acceptable complication profile, and decrease the need for tunnelled central lines.

### Prevention of peripherally inserted central line-associated blood stream infections in very low-birth-weight infants by using a central line bundle guideline with a standard checklist: a case control study [^ab7fae41]. BMC Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In summary, a CLB guideline can effectively, simply, and feasibly reduce the incidence of colonization infection and CRBSIs in VLBWIs, without any additional investment. In addition, this study found that it is important to ensure that each measure is completed. We found that each measure was implemented effectively by following the standard checklist, and hence, the CLB guideline could have a greater impact in preventing infection.

### Ultrasound guidance versus landmark method for peripheral venous cannulation in adults [^7498e2d1]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Peripheral intravenous cannulation is one of the most fundamental and common procedures in medicine. Securing a peripheral line is occasionally difficult with the landmark method. Ultrasound guidance has become a standard procedure for central venous cannulation, but its efficacy in achieving peripheral venous cannulation is unclear.

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of ultrasound guidance compared to the landmark method for peripheral intravenous cannulation in adults. SEARCH METHODS: We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search date was 29 November 2021.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs (RCTs in which participants are systematically allocated based on data such as date of birth or recruitment) comparing the effects of ultrasound guidance to the landmark method for peripheral intravenous cannulation in adults.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were first-pass success of cannulation, overall success of cannulation, and pain. Our secondary outcomes were procedure time for first-pass cannulation, procedure time for overall cannulation, number of attempts, patient satisfaction, and overall complications. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. Placing a peripheral intravenous line in individuals can be classed as 'difficult', 'moderate', or 'easy'. We use the terms 'difficult participants', 'moderate/moderately difficult participants' and 'easy participants' as shorthand to characterise the difficulty level in placing a peripheral line using the landmark method. We used the original studies' definitions of difficulty levels of peripheral intravenous cannulation with the landmark method. We analysed the results in these subgroups: 'difficult participants', 'moderate participants', and 'easy participants'. We did this because we expected the effect of ultrasound-guided peripheral venous cannulation to be largest in participants classed as 'difficult' and smaller in participants classed as 'moderate' and 'easy'. MAIN RESULTS: We included 14 RCTs and two quasi-RCTs involving 2267 participants undergoing peripheral intravenous cannulation. Participants were classed as 'difficult' in 12 studies (880 participants), 'moderate' in one study (401 participants), and 'easy' in one study (596 participants). Two studies (390 participants) did not restrict by landmark method difficulty level. The overall risk of bias assessments ranged from low to high. We judged studies to be at high risk of bias mainly because of concerns about blinding for subjective outcomes. In difficult participants, ultrasound guidance increased the first-pass success of cannulation (risk ratio (RR) 1.50, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.15 to 1.95; 10 studies, 815 participants; low-certainty evidence), and the overall success of cannulation (RR 1.40, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.77; 10 studies, 670 participants; very low-certainty evidence). There was no clear difference in pain (mean difference (MD) -0.20, 95% CI -1.13 to 0.72; 4 studies, 323 participants; very low-certainty evidence; numerical rating scale (NRS) 0 to 10 where 10 is maximum pain). Ultrasound guidance increased the procedure time for first-pass cannulation (MD 119.9 seconds, 95% CI 88.6 to 151.1; 2 studies, 219 participants; low-certainty evidence), and patient satisfaction (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.49, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.92; 5 studies, 333 participants; very low-certainty evidence; NRS 0 to 10 where 10 is maximum satisfaction). Ultrasound guidance decreased the number of cannulation attempts (MD -0.33, 95% CI -0.64 to -0.02; 9 studies, 568 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Ultrasound guidance showed no clear difference in the procedure time for overall cannulation (MD -24.9 seconds, 95% CI -323.1 to 273.3; 8 studies, 413 participants; very low-certainty evidence) and overall complications (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.37 to 1.10; 5 studies, 431 participants; low-certainty evidence). In moderate participants, ultrasound guidance increased the first-pass success of cannulation (RR 1.14, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.27; 1 study, 401 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). No studies assessed the overall success of cannulation. There was no clear difference in pain (MD 0.10, 95% CI -0.47 to 0.67; 1 study, 401 participants; low-certainty evidence; NRS 0 to 10 where 10 is maximum pain). Ultrasound guidance increased the procedure time for first-pass cannulation (MD 95.2 seconds, 95% CI 72.8 to 117.6; 1 study, 401 participants; high-certainty evidence). Ultrasound guidance showed no clear difference in overall complications (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.82; 1 study, 401 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). No studies assessed the procedure time for overall cannulation, number of cannulation attempts, or patient satisfaction. In easy participants, ultrasound guidance decreased the first-pass success of cannulation (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.85 to 0.94; 1 study, 596 participants; high-certainty evidence). No studies assessed the overall success of cannulation. Ultrasound guidance increased pain (MD 0.60, 95% CI 0.17 to 1.03; 1 study, 596 participants; moderate-certainty evidence; NRS 0 to 10 where 10 is maximum pain). Ultrasound guidance increased the procedure time for first-pass cannulation (MD 94.8 seconds, 95% CI 81.2 to 108.5; 1 study, 596 participants; high-certainty evidence). Ultrasound guidance showed no clear difference in overall complications (RR 2.48, 95% CI 0.90 to 6.87; 1 study, 596 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). No studies assessed the procedure time for overall cannulation, number of cannulation attempts, or patient satisfaction. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is very low- and low-certainty evidence that, compared to the landmark method, ultrasound guidance may benefit difficult participants for increased first-pass and overall success of cannulation, with no difference detected in pain. There is moderate- and low-certainty evidence that, compared to the landmark method, ultrasound guidance may benefit moderately difficult participants due to a small increased first-pass success of cannulation with no difference detected in pain. There is moderate- and high-certainty evidence that, compared to the landmark method, ultrasound guidance does not benefit easy participants: ultrasound guidance decreased the first-pass success of cannulation with no difference detected in overall success of cannulation and increased pain.

### When is parenteral nutrition appropriate? [^5ba62754]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2017). Medium credibility.

Peripheral and central access considerations for PN: Although peripheral intravenous catheters (PIVs) can be used to administer dilute nutrient admixtures, a high rate of technical failure stands out as the chief disadvantage of these devices, and PIVs are intended for short-term use with an important limitation being the need for frequent reinsertion. Policies governing dwell time for PIVs vary, with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggesting rotating insertion sites every 72–96 hours, whereas Infusion Nurses Society standards recommend replacing PIVs only when clinically indicated based on regular inspection. A large multicenter prospective study found an increase in phlebitis in PIVs after 96 hours in situ, and another study suggested a link between primary bloodstream infection and PIVs left in place longer than 72 hours. Peripheral midline catheters, which can remain in place for 29 days, may offer an alternative but are still prone to phlebitis and have not been studied for peripheral PN. Central PN administration circumvents many technical problems of peripheral PN; however, central venous access devices (CVADs) remain a leading source of adverse events related to PN administration, and for both adult and pediatric patients, central line–associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) rank among the most common complications associated with the use of CVADs.

### Should the CDC's recommendations for promptly removing unnecessary centrally inserted central catheters be enhanced? Ultrasound-guided peripheral venous cannulation to fully comply [^0e458774]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

In an effort to reduce catheter-related bloodstream infection's incidence rates in an intensive care unit, several evidence-based procedures recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for centrally inserted central catheters were implemented. A failure to fully comply with the recommendation for prompt removal of the centrally inserted central catheters was attributed, mainly to the difficulties and inadequacies raised from establishing peripheral venous access.

Methods

The ultrasound-guided peripheral venous cannulation method as a supplementary intervention to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's recommendations was incorporated and examined during the subsequent year.

Results

A significant reduction on catheter-related bloodstream infection incidence rates out of the expected range was found. Centrally inserted central catheters utilization ratios were reduced by 10.7% (p < 0.05; 58%-47%) and the catheter-related bloodstream infection incidence rate was reduced by 11.7 per thousand device-days (15.9–4.16/1000 centrally inserted central catheters days (2015–2016 group, respectively)).

Conclusion

The reduction of catheter-related bloodstream infection was higher than that described in the published literature. This probably shows that the combination of the five evidence-based procedures recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention together with that of ultrasound-guided peripheral venous cannulation method can increase the compliance with the Category IA recommendation for removal or avoidance of unnecessary placement of centrally inserted central catheters and decrease the catheter-related bloodstream infections in a more effective way, by affecting the patients' centrally inserted central catheter exposure.

### Motion-robustquantification from low-resolution gradient echo brain MRI with physics-informed deep learning [^ac7dfcb2]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2026). Medium credibility.

3.4.1 Validation of assumptions

PHIMO+ relies on assumptions for the reconstruction and line detection steps, including the proposed KeepCenter and Even/Odd extensions. To ensure the validity of these assumptions, we conduct experiments using the MoCo validation subject, i.e. the subject performing four different motion patterns with three different amplitudes. Regarding the reconstruction choices, we test if the central four k‐space points are affected by motion (Section 2.3). For this, we compare reconstructions of only the central four k‐space points from acquisitions without and with intentional motion. Additionally, we investigate the impact of KeepCenter on the reconstruction quality when excluding several central k‐space lines. To assess this, we compare the mean absolute error (MAE) ofmaps obtained from networks trained without and with KeepCenter.

For the line detection choices, we first validate that the proposed physics‐informed loss function correlates with the degree of motion that affects the GRE data. For this, we compare the loss value for motion‐free images and three levels of intentional motion. Furthermore, we evaluate the effects of the Even/Odd extension on the detection robustness across the brain by analyzing the line detection accuracy relative to the reference mask for different slice numbers. Lastly, we investigate if the line detection performance depends on the line's specific k‐space location. For this, we compare the detection accuracy across all slices and motion experiments for three k‐space regions: low frequencies (30 central k‐space lines), high frequencies (32 peripheral lines, 16 on each side), and medium frequencies (30 lines in between).

### When is parenteral nutrition appropriate? [^251f979c]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2017). Medium credibility.

Venous access for PN — indications for central access and site monitoring: The choice of VAD should be based on the nutrition care plan, including duration of therapy and osmolarity of the admixture. If PN is to be administered for more than 5 days or when the osmolality of the PN formulation is greater than 900 mOsm/L, then central venous access should be obtained. For peripheral PN, frequent monitoring of the intravenous site for early signs of infiltration per hospital policy is important, and adherence to standard venous access care policies to prevent PN complications, including central line–associated bloodstream infection, should be part of the monitoring process.

### Use and outcomes of peripheral vasopressors in early sepsis-induced hypotension across Michigan hospitals: a retrospective cohort study [^538d67ec]. Chest (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Vasopressors traditionally are administered via central access, but newer data suggest that peripheral administration may be safe and may avoid delays and complications associated with central line placement.

Research Question

How commonly are vasopressors initiated through peripheral IV lines in routine practice? Is vasopressor initiation route associated with in-hospital mortality?

Study Design and Methods

This retrospective cohort study included adults hospitalized with sepsis (November 2020-September 2022) at 29 hospitals in the Michigan Hospital Medicine Safety Consortium, a Collaborative Quality Initiative sponsored by Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan. We assessed route of early vasopressor initiation, factors and outcomes associated with peripheral initiation, and timing of central line placement.

Results

Five hundred ninety-four patients received vasopressors within 6 h of hospital arrival and were included in this study. Peripheral vasopressor initiation was common (400/594 [67.3%]). Patients with peripheral vs central initiation were similar; BMI was the only patient factor associated independently with initiation route (adjusted OR [aOR] of peripheral initiation [per 1-kg/m 2 increase], 0.98; 95% CI, 0.97–1.00; P = 0.015). The specific hospital showed a large impact on initiation route (median OR, 2.19; 95% CI, 1.31–3.07). Compared with central initiation, peripheral initiation was faster (median, 2.5 h vs 2.7 h from hospital arrival; P = 0.002), but was associated with less initial norepinephrine use (84.3% vs 96.8%; P = 0.001). We found no independent association between initiation route and in-hospital mortality (32.3% vs 42.2%; aOR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.39–1.12). No tissue injury from peripheral vasopressors was documented. Of patients with peripheral initiation, 135 of 400 patients (33.8%) never received a central line.

Interpretation

Peripheral vasopressor initiation was common across Michigan hospitals and had practical benefits, including expedited vasopressor administration and avoidance of central line placement in one-third of patients. However, the findings of wide practice variation that was not explained by patient case mix and lower use of first-line norepinephrine with peripheral administration suggest that additional standardization may be needed.

### PICC line management among patients with chronic kidney disease [^10549f3b]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2023). Medium credibility.

More than 1million peripherally inserted central catheters (PICC) are placed annually in the US and are used to provide convenient vascular access for a variety of reasons including long term antibiotic treatment, chemotherapy, parenteral nutrition, and blood draws. Although they are relatively easy to place and inexpensive, PICC line use is associated with many complications such as phlebitis/thrombophlebitis, venous thrombosis, catheter-related infection, wound infection, and central vein stenosis. These complications are far more deleterious for patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) whose lives depend on a functioning hemodialysis access once they reach end stage kidney disease (ESKD). Despite recent guidelines to avoid PICC lines in CKD and ESKD patients, clinical use remains high. There is an ongoing urgency to educate and inform health care providers and the CKD patients themselves in preserving their venous real estate. In this article, we review AV access and PICC line background, complications associated with PICC lines in the CKD population, and recommendations for alternatives to placing a PICC line in this vulnerable patient population.

### Peripherally or centrally inserted central catheters: what is the best vascular access device for cancer patients? [^e9294436]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2021). Medium credibility.

Choosing the appropriate vascular access device is a pivotal step to guarantee vessel health and preservation in cancer patients. The first turning point is the determination of the need for central venous catheters (CVCs) followed by the selection of the CVC that will complete the prescribed treatment while minimizing complications and satisfying patients' needs and expectations. Peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) have steadily grown over the years as an alternative to centrally inserted central catheters and totally implantable catheters based on several advantages including avoidance of placement-associated mechanical complications, easier transitions from hospital to intermediate care settings and home, but also increase in healthcare expenditure, supportive reimbursement policies, and ability to train existing staff. Notwithstanding PICCs have been perceived for a long time as associated with fewer complications, reduced costs, and higher patients' satisfaction compared to other CVCs, recent evidence has raised concerns about their safety profile without any benefits for longer-term costs neither for patients' satisfaction. This commentary offers a comprehensive overview on PICC-related (1) complications, (2) costs, and (3) patients' satisfaction to help healthcare professionals in the choice of the vascular device during their clinical practice. Based on the most recent literature, we finally suggested that the choice of the CVC should depend on the clinical situation with totally implantable catheters being the preferred device for patients who need intermittent long-term and high-dose chemotherapy, while PICCs may be a better choice for patients who need short-term chemotherapy or continuous short-term supportive therapy.

### The risk of bloodstream infection associated with peripherally inserted central catheters compared with central venous catheters in adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^4cfd8059]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) are associated with central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI). The magnitude of this risk relative to central venous catheters (CVCs) is unknown.

Objective

To compare risk of CLABSI between PICCs and CVCs.

Methods

MEDLINE, CinAHL, Scopus, EmBASE, and Cochrane CENTRAL were searched. Full-text studies comparing the risk of CLABSI between PICCs and CVCs were included. Studies involving adults 18 years of age or older who underwent insertion of a PICC or a CVC and reported CLABSI were included in our analysis. Studies were evaluated using the Downs and Black scale for risk of bias. Random effects meta-analyses were used to generate summary estimates of CLABSI risk in patients with PICCs versus CVCs.

Results

Of 1,185 studies identified, 23 studies involving 57,250 patients met eligibility criteria. Twenty of 23 eligible studies reported the total number of CLABSI episodes in patients with PICCs and CVCs. Pooled meta-analyses of these studies revealed that PICCs were associated with a lower risk of CLABSI than were CVCs (relative risk [RR], 0.62; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.40–0.94). Statistical heterogeneity prompted subgroup analysis, which demonstrated that CLABSI reduction was greatest in outpatients (RR [95% CI], 0.22 [0.18–0.27]) compared with hospitalized patients who received PICCs (RR [95% CI], 0.73 [0.54–0.98]). Thirteen of the included 23 studies reported CLABSI per catheter-day. Within these studies, PICC-related CLABSI occurred as frequently as CLABSI from CVCs (incidence rate ratio [95% CI], 0.91 [0.46–1.79]).

Limitations

Only 1 randomized trial met inclusion criteria. CLABSI definition and infection prevention strategies were variably reported. Few studies reported infections by catheter-days.

Conclusions

Although PICCs are associated with a lower risk of CLABSI than CVCs in outpatients, hospitalized patients may be just as likely to experience CLABSI with PICCs as with CVCs. Consideration of risks and benefits before PICC use in inpatient settings is warranted.

### Peripherally inserted central venous catheters: frequency of complications in premature newborn depends on the insertion site [^85ef641d]. Journal of Perinatology (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

The use of peripherally inserted central venous catheters (PICC lines) has reduced the mortality and morbidity of premature newborns. The usual sites of insertion are the veins in the upper arms but other locations are being used as well.

Study Design

To examine whether using the axillary vein as a site of insertion of a PICC line affects the frequency of complications. Our study has a clinical trial design. A total of 62 neonates that had a PICC line inserted were recruited and randomly divided equally in two groups: in Group A (mean birth weight, standard deviation (s.d.) = 1353 (142)g), the PICC line was inserted through the axillary vein, and in Group B (birth weight = 1308 (112)g), the PICC line was inserted in other sites further from the axillary vein. The outcomes measured were the total PICC line-related complications, the reason for removing the catheter, the number of total attempts until successful insertion and the mean duration of stay of the catheter. The likelihood of having an adverse outcome was assessed with Mantel-Haenszel odds ratio (OR).

Results

Premature neonates with axillary PICC lines were 12 times less likely to have line-related complications (inflammation, blockage, edema, infection) as compared with any other site of insertion (OR = 95%, confidence interval (CI) = 0.10 (0.01 to 0.8)) and they were seven times more likely to have the PICC line removed because they achieved full enteral nutrition as compared with the other causes (OR 95%, confidence interval (CI) = 10.35 (4.88 to 21.96)). There was no statistical difference between the two groups in the number of attempts until successful PICC line insertion (P = 0.667) and the mean duration of stay of the PICC line (P = 0.97).

Conclusion

The use of the axillary vein as a site of insertion of a PICC line was correlated with significantly less complications in premature newborns as opposed to the other sites of insertion.

### Association of anaesthetists guidelines: safe vascular access 2025 [^01bbd60b]. Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Device selection

Clinicians face a vast and often confusing array of options, but choosing the right device for individual patients is crucial for device longevity, device functionality, complication rates and patient satisfaction (Table 3).

Table 3
Factors influencing choice of vascular access device.

The Working Party recommends that patients should have access to all commonly used vascular access devices, including short and long peripheral cannulae; midline catheters; temporary central venous catheters; peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs); tunnelled central venous catheters; and portacaths. Expertise should be available to access commonly used veins, such as upper and lower arm veins; internal jugular vein; subclavian/axillary vein; and femoral veins. Where required, computed tomography‐rated or power‐injectable devices that can withstand the pressures up to 300 psi and flow rates up to 5 ml.s ‐1 needed for contrast injection should be considered.

Pathways for care and decision making should be established using models (Fig. 1). Long peripheral catheters (6–15 cm in length) and midline catheters (typically > 15 cm in length) are inserted usually through large upper arm veins (basilic, brachial or cephalic) with the tip lying outside of the central veins. Although the blood flow at the tip of these catheters is higher than that found in peripheral veins, it is not sufficient to allow infusions of vesicants/irritants other than for short‐term or emergency use. Long peripheral catheters and midline catheters are rarely sufficient for regular phlebotomy. Recent evidence is that for systemic anticancer therapy, portacaths are more effective and safer than both Hickman lines and PICCs. Portacaths should be available to all patients who would benefit.

Figure 1
Decision‐making tree for selecting a vascular access device. CVP, central venous pressure; CVC, central venous catheter; CT, computed tomography.

Providers should make provision for the timely insertion and care of all commonly used vascular access devices; there should be minimal variation in these practices between hospitals and geographical areas. The use of hub‐and‐spoke models of care and referral to specialist centres will help broaden provision. Recognition of risk factors for difficult intravenous access and a co‐ordinated effort to preserve long‐term vein health at all stages of life should be an established part of all patient care and should be central to a wider vascular access service.

### Economic evaluation of peripherally inserted central catheter and other venous access devices: a scoping review [^d46acd6f]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

With the widespread use of peripherally inserted central catheters, plenty of studies have compared peripherally inserted central catheters with other venous access devices to choose the most appropriate device in different clinical scenarios. Economic attributes are one of the important influencing factors in the selection of venous access devices. Several economic evaluation studies have been conducted in this area, but the evaluation methods, contents, outcomes, and quality of these economic studies have not been systematically evaluated. Therefore, we aimed to map the existing research on the economic evaluations of peripherally inserted central catheters and other venous access devices to provide economic evidence for decision-makers to choose a suitable venous access device. Second, we appraised the quality of economic evaluation studies in this area to highlight methodological weaknesses and provide an outline for the normative application of this methodology for future research.

Methods

A literature search was undertaken through 11 databases from inception until 11 March 2019, to identify economic evaluation studies comparing peripherally inserted central catheters with other venous access devices. After screening articles and extracting data independently, we summarized methods, contents, and outcomes of the included studies and appraised their methodological quality using the Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal checklist for economic evaluations.

Results

A total of 16 studies were included. Among the six studies comparing peripherally inserted central catheters with peripheral intravenous catheters, four studies performed a cost-effectiveness analysis and noted that peripherally inserted central catheters were more cost-effective than peripheral intravenous catheters. Two studies performed a cost analysis to compare peripherally inserted central catheters with peripheral intravenous catheters during the insertion and maintenance/removal periods but reached different conclusions. Seven of the included studies performed a cost analysis to compare peripherally inserted central catheters with central venous catheters. They pointed out that the catheter insertion costs of peripherally inserted central catheters were lower than those for central venous catheters in developed countries, whereas the opposite conclusion was reached in developing countries. Conversely, conclusions regarding the costs for catheter maintenance and catheter insertion and maintenance/removal were inconsistent. Six of the included studies performed a cost analysis to compare peripherally inserted central catheters with vascular access ports. They pointed out that the insertion costs of peripherally inserted central catheters were lower than those for vascular access ports, and the maintenance costs were higher than those for vascular access ports. Conversely, conclusions regarding the costs for catheter insertion and maintenance/removal were inconsistent. In addition, the methodological quality of the included studies had plenty of deficiencies, including no discounting, no sensitivity analysis, no incremental analysis, a lack of validity of costs and effectiveness, and so on.

Conclusion

This scoping review highlighted the desperate paucity of economic evaluation studies of peripherally inserted central catheters and other venous access devices in amount, evaluation contents, and economic evaluation methods. The conclusions of the cost-effectiveness analysis of peripherally inserted central catheters with other venous access devices were consistent. Conversely, the conclusions of the cost analysis of peripherally inserted central catheters with other venous access devices were inconsistent mainly in the comparison of peripherally inserted central catheters with peripheral intravenous catheters, central venous catheters, and vascular access ports during the insertion and maintenance/removal periods. This review also highlighted many methodological issues of economic evaluations in this area. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct more high-quality economic evaluation studies on peripherally inserted central catheters and other venous access devices by performing cost-effectiveness analysis, cost-utility analysis, or cost-benefit analysis from catheter insertion to removal to provide evidence for clinical practitioners, patients, and decision-makers to choose a suitable venous access device in different clinical scenarios.

### Peripherally inserted central catheter design and material for reducing catheter failure and complications [^1ae82948]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) facilitate diagnostic and therapeutic interventions in health care. PICCs can fail due to infective and non-infective complications, which PICC materials and design may contribute to, leading to negative sequelae for patients and healthcare systems.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of PICC material and design in reducing catheter failure and complications.

Search Methods

The University of Queensland and Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL databases and the WHO ICTRP and ClinicalTrials.gov trials registers to 16 May 2023. We aimed to identify other potentially eligible trials or ancillary publications by searching the reference lists of retrieved included trials, as well as relevant systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and health technology assessment reports. We contacted experts in the field to ascertain additional relevant information.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating PICC design and materials.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were venous thromboembolism (VTE), PICC-associated bloodstream infection (BSI), occlusion, and all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes were catheter failure, PICC-related BSI, catheter breakage, PICC dwell time, and safety endpoints. We assessed the certainty of evidence using GRADE.

Main Results

We included 12 RCTs involving approximately 2913 participants (one multi-arm study). All studies except one had a high risk of bias in one or more risk of bias domain. Integrated valve technology compared to no valve technology for peripherally inserted central catheter design Integrated valve technology may make little or no difference to VTE risk when compared with PICCs with no valve (risk ratio (RR) 0.71, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.19 to 2.63; I² = 0%; 3 studies; 437 participants; low certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether integrated valve technology reduces PICC-associated BSI risk, as the certainty of the evidence is very low (RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.01 to 4.00; I² = not applicable; 2 studies (no events in 1 study); 257 participants). Integrated valve technology may make little or no difference to occlusion risk when compared with PICCs with no valve (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.38; I² = 0%; 5 studies; 900 participants; low certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether use of integrated valve technology reduces all-cause mortality risk, as the certainty of evidence is very low (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.64; I² = 0%; 2 studies; 473 participants). Integrated valve technology may make little or no difference to catheter failure risk when compared with PICCs with no valve (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.03; I² = 0%; 4 studies; 720 participants; low certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether integrated-valve technology reduces PICC-related BSI risk (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.19 to 1.32; I² = not applicable; 2 studies (no events in 1 study); 542 participants) or catheter breakage, as the certainty of evidence is very low (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.22 to 5.06; I² = 20%; 4 studies; 799 participants). Anti-thrombogenic surface modification compared to no anti-thrombogenic surface modification for peripherally inserted central catheter design We are uncertain whether use of anti-thrombogenic surface modified catheters reduces risk of VTE (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.13 to 3.54; I² = 15%; 2 studies; 257 participants) or PICC-associated BSI, as the certainty of evidence is very low (RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.01 to 4.00; I² = not applicable; 2 studies (no events in 1 study); 257 participants). We are uncertain whether use of anti-thrombogenic surface modified catheters reduces occlusion (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.04 to 11.22; I² = 70%; 2 studies; 257 participants) or all-cause mortality risk, as the certainty of evidence is very low (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.05 to 5.26; I² = not applicable; 1 study; 111 participants). Use of anti-thrombogenic surface modified catheters may make little or no difference to risk of catheter failure (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.37 to 1.54; I² = 46%; 2 studies; 257 participants; low certainty evidence). No PICC-related BSIs were reported in one study (111 participants). As such, we are uncertain whether use of anti-thrombogenic surface modified catheters reduces PICC-related BSI risk (RR not estimable; I² = not applicable; very low certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether use of anti-thrombogenic surface modified catheters reduces the risk of catheter breakage, as the certainty of evidence is very low (RR 0.15, 95% CI 0.01 to 2.79; I² = not applicable; 2 studies (no events in 1 study); 257 participants). Antimicrobial impregnation compared to non-antimicrobial impregnation for peripherally inserted central catheter design We are uncertain whether use of antimicrobial-impregnated catheters reduces VTE risk (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.05 to 5.88; I² = not applicable; 1 study; 167 participants) or PICC-associated BSI risk, as the certainty of evidence is very low (RR 2.17, 95% CI 0.20 to 23.53; I² = not applicable; 1 study; 167 participants). Antimicrobial-impregnated catheters probably make little or no difference to occlusion risk (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.74; I² = 0%; 2 studies; 1025 participants; moderate certainty evidence) or all-cause mortality (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.75; I² = 0%; 2 studies; 1082 participants; moderate certainty evidence). Antimicrobial-impregnated catheters may make little or no difference to risk of catheter failure (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.30; I² = not applicable; 1 study; 221 participants; low certainty evidence). Antimicrobial-impregnated catheters probably make little or no difference to PICC-related BSI risk (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.55; I² = not applicable; 2 studies (no events in 1 study); 1082 participants; moderate certainty evidence). Antimicrobial-impregnated catheters may make little or no difference to risk of catheter breakage (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.19 to 3.83; I² = not applicable; 1 study; 804 participants; low certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

There is limited high-quality RCT evidence available to inform clinician decision-making for PICC materials and design. Limitations of the current evidence include small sample sizes, infrequent events, and risk of bias. There may be little to no difference in the risk of VTE, PICC-associated BSI, occlusion, or mortality across PICC materials and designs. Further rigorous RCTs are needed to reduce uncertainty.

### Should in-line filters be used in peripheral intravenous catheters to prevent infusion-related phlebitis? A systematic review of randomized controlled trials [^425d45c0]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2010). Low credibility.

Background

In this systematic review, we assessed the effect of in-line filters on infusion-related phlebitis associated with peripheral IV catheters. The study was designed as a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials. We used MEDLINE and the Cochrane Controlled Trial Register up to August 10, 2009.

Methods

Two reviewers independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Data on phlebitis were combined when appropriate, using a random-effects model. The impact of the risk of phlebitis in the control group (baseline risk) on the effect of in-line filters was studied by using meta-regression based on the bivariate meta-analysis model. The quality of the evidence was determined by using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) method.

Results

Eleven trials (1633 peripheral catheters) were included in this review to compare the effect of in-line filters on the incidence of phlebitis in hospitalized patients. Baseline risks across trials ranged from 23% to 96%. Meta-analysis of all trials showed that in-line filters reduced the risk of infusion-related phlebitis (relative risk, 0.66; 95% confidence interval, 0.43–1.00). This benefit, however, is very uncertain, because the trials had serious methodological shortcomings and meta-analysis revealed marked unexplained statistical heterogeneity (P < 0.0000, I(2) = 90.4%). The estimated benefit did not depend on baseline risk.

Conclusion

In-line filters in peripheral IV catheters cannot be recommended routinely, because evidence of their benefit is uncertain.

### The Michigan appropriateness guide for intravenous catheters (MAGIC) initiative: a summary and review of peripherally inserted central catheter and venous catheter appropriate use [^13540498]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) are being selected for venous access more frequently today than ever before. Often the choice of a PICC, when compared with other vascular access devices (VADs), is attractive because of perceived safety, availability, and ease of insertion. However, complications associated with PICCs exist, and there is a paucity of evidence to guide clinician choice for PICC selection and valid use. An international panel with expertise in the arena of venous access and populations associated with these devices was convened to clarify approaches for the optimal use of PICCs and VADs. Here we present for the busy hospital-based practitioner the methodology, key outcomes, and recommendations of the Michigan Appropriateness Guide for Intravenous Catheters (MAGIC) panelists for the appropriate use of VADs.

### Central or peripheral catheters for initial venous access of ICU patients: a randomized controlled trial [^8c8452a4]. Critical Care Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives

The vast majority of ICU patients require some form of venous access. There are no evidenced-based guidelines concerning the use of either central or peripheral venous catheters, despite very different complications. It remains unknown which to insert in ICU patients. We investigated the rate of catheter-related insertion or maintenance complications in two strategies: one favoring the central venous catheters and the other peripheral venous catheters.

Design

Multicenter, controlled, parallel-group, open-label randomized trial.

Setting

Three French ICUs.

Patients

Adult ICU patients with equal central or peripheral venous access requirement.

Intervention

Patients were randomized to receive central venous catheters or peripheral venous catheters as initial venous access.

Measurements and Results

The primary endpoint was the rate of major catheter-related complications within 28 days. Secondary endpoints were the rate of minor catheter-related complications and a composite score-assessing staff utilization and time spent to manage catheter insertions. Analysis was intention to treat. We randomly assigned 135 patients to receive a central venous catheter and 128 patients to receive a peripheral venous catheter. Major catheter-related complications were greater in the peripheral venous catheter than in the central venous catheter group (133 vs 87, respectively, p = 0.02) although none of those was life threatening. Minor catheter-related complications were 201 with central venous catheters and 248 with peripheral venous catheters (p = 0.06). 46% (60/128) patients were managed throughout their ICU stay with peripheral venous catheters only. There were significantly more peripheral venous catheter-related complications per patient in patients managed solely with peripheral venous catheter than in patients that received peripheral venous catheter and at least one central venous catheter: 1.92 (121/63) versus 1.13 (226/200), p < 0.005. There was no difference in central venous catheter-related complications per patient between patients initially randomized to peripheral venous catheters but subsequently crossed-over to central venous catheter and patients randomized to the central venous catheter group. Kaplan-Meier estimates of survival probability did not differ between the two groups.

Conclusion

In ICU patients with equal central or peripheral venous access requirement, central venous catheters should preferably be inserted: a strategy associated with less major complications.

### Use of peripherally inserted central venous catheters and midline catheters for palliative care in patients with cancer: a systematic review [^f2b7aeb1]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Traditionally, the subcutaneous (SC) route has due to its simplicity, safety, and ubiquity been preferred for parenteral drug administration in palliative care patients. This is reflected in existing guidelines where the SC route is advocated as the preferred route for parenteral administration. Yet, the intravenous (IV) route, with its broader applicability, reduced incidence of local infiltrations and irritations, and more consistent pharmacokinetics, is recognized as a valuable alternative, especially when rapid drug action is paramount.

Peripherally inserted central venous catheters (PICC) and midline catheters (MC) not only enable easier IV treatment in home care settings but also sidestep the discomforts associated with frequent venipuncture and cannulation. PICCs are inserted into the basilic, cephalic, or brachial vein by percutaneous cannulation. MCs, peripheral intravenous lines ranging between 3 and 8 inches, are inserted by the same technique without advancing the catheter beyond the distal axillary vein, primarily catering to shorter-term requirements.

While several studies address PICC placement in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy, comprehensive guidelines from both European and American Societies of Oncology neither endorse nor discourage the use of a particular type of central venous catheter. Notably, recent randomized controlled trials support the preference of venous access ports over PICC for chemotherapy due to thrombosis concerns. The Michigan Appropriateness Guide for Intravenous Catheters (MAGIC), based on a combination of systematic reviews and expert opinions, positions PICCs as a viable option for cancer patients undergoing prolonged IV therapy. However, it underscores a paucity of data concerning palliative care.

The aim of this systematic review was to comprehensively assess the use of PICC and MC in palliative care cancer patients. This entails identifying the indications and settings for catheter placement, treatments and procedures in which these catheters are applied, catheter dwell times, the timing of placement in relation to a patient's death, and complications and reasons for catheter removal. Additionally, this review aimed to assess palliative care cancer patients' experiences with PICC or MC.

### Late development of early visual perception: No topology-priority in peripheral vision until age 10 [^57f44b0b]. Child Development (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Previous evidence shows that the global TP is processed prior to other geometric properties (e.g. Huang et al.). This study sought to investigate how this "global‐first" develops during childhood. We investigated the performance of 773 children aged 6 to 14 years, as compared to adults, in a TP and non‐TP discrimination task. Potential confounding factors for TP discrimination, for example, luminance, size, and the number of lines, were controlled and matched between different stimuli. In addition to letter‐like stimuli, we also used geometric stimuli, that is, arrow‐triangle figures, to examine whether effects depended on the use of letter‐like forms whose familiarity may have changed with age. The results revealed that adults and children ≥ 10 years old showed a TP priority effect in both their central and peripheral visual fields, that is, they processed TP differences faster than non‐TP differences. Children aged 6–8 years showed a different TP‐processing pattern, that is, the TP priority effect has not been fully demonstrated at this age, which might be more apparent in their peripheral visual field compared with the central visual field.

According to previous research, the physical size of a stimulus could affect the processing speed (Carrasco et al.). To test whether the TP priority effect would be affected by the magnified peripheral stimuli, we made central and peripheral stimuli equal in physical size in Experiment 2. We observed that the decrease in peripheral stimulus size led to an increase in RTs, which is consistent with previous studies (e.g. Osaka). Nevertheless, the TP priority effect remained the same for the reduced peripheral stimulus, suggesting that the TP priority effect was not affected by the stimulus size.

There is a possibility that the lower accuracy of 6‐year‐old children would influence their performance on TP and non‐TP discrimination speed, that is, the TP priority effect. This question was investigated in Experiment 3. We found that the TP priority effect of adults was still robust even when the average accuracy was lower than that of the 6‐year‐old group. Therefore, task difficulty did not contribute to the present finding that 6‐ to 8‐year‐olds did not show the TP priority effect in peripheral vision.

### Association of infectious disease physician approval of peripherally inserted central catheter with appropriateness and complications [^cd4ce1e4]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) are central venous catheters used ubiquitously in medical care. Compared with central venous catheters placed in the neck or chest, PICCs are placed in upper-extremity veins in adults and consequently avoid many of the immediate insertion complications associated with device placement. As PICC use has increased, however, reports of complications, such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and central line–associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI), have emerged. One strategy to reduce the risk of PICC-related complications is to consider the appropriateness of PICC use, including aspects such as device characteristics and use of alternatives. For example, use of single-lumen (vs multilumen) devices can reduce the risk of DVT or CLABSI. Similarly, use of PICCs with a smaller cross-sectional diameter (ie, catheter gauge) is known to be associated with fewer thrombotic complications. Furthermore, because safer alternative devices are available, PICC use should be avoided if access is needed for a brief period (ie, ≤ 5 days) or for patients with chronic kidney disease. Collectively, these findings have led to Choosing Wisely recommendationsand appropriateness criteriato inform and benchmark PICC use.

One of the most common indications for PICC insertion is intravenous antimicrobial therapy. Consequently, infectious disease (ID) physicians are often involved in decision-making related to PICC use. If they are consulted early, ID physicians may be able to prevent inappropriate PICC use — for example, for patients who could have their antimicrobials discontinued or switched to oral therapy. Similarly, because ID physicians often treat CLABSIs, they may be more likely to recommend interventions to reduce the risk of CLABSI, such as the use of single-lumen PICCs or antimicrobial catheters in patients who are at high risk of adverse events. Despite this, little is known about the association of ID physician approval with PICC appropriateness and outcomes. Because device complications are common in patients receiving intravenous antimicrobials, there may be an opportunity to improve patient safety by engaging ID physicians prior to PICC insertion.

The Michigan Hospital Medicine Safety Consortium (HMS) is a statewide quality collaborative aimed at preventing adverse events in hospitalized medical patients. Since 2015, the HMS has collected detailed data on PICCs, allowing for assessment of PICC appropriateness, and patient outcomes. We sought to evaluate whether ID physician approval of PICC use prior to placement for intravenous antimicrobials is associated with appropriate device use and fewer complications.

Peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) cannulation — common complications are thrombosis, bleeding, tip malposition, arm discomfort, and line malfunction; there is a comparable incidence of central line and PICC line–associated bloodstream infections (5.2%) and a higher incidence of catheter-related deep vein thrombosis at the PICC insertion site (13.9%); these complications occur independently of whether insertion was ultrasound-guided, and careful consideration should be given to the number of lumens as this directly relates to complication occurrence.

### Safety and efficacy of midline vs peripherally inserted central catheters among adults receiving IV therapy: a randomized clinical trial [^663c171e]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

The study Midline vs. Peripherally Inserted Central Catheters was published by Simon L Thomsen and colleagues in 2024 in the journal JAMA Netw Open. This study is related to the following diseases: Catheter-related bloodstream infection, Sepsis and septic shock, Catheter-related thrombosis, Maintenance fluid therapy and Parenteral nutrition. In the Midline vs. Peripherally Inserted Central Catheters study, the trial question was: what is the role of midline catheters in patients receiving intravenous therapy? In the Midline vs. Peripherally Inserted Central Catheters study, the study design was: single center, open label, RCT. In the Midline vs. Peripherally Inserted Central Catheters study, the population was: 304 patients (130 female, 174 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients with an anticipated IV therapy lasting from 5 to 28 days. The key exclusion criteria were pregnancy; infection or burns at both upper extremities; existing central venous catheter; informed consent not obtainable. In the Midline vs. Peripherally Inserted Central Catheters study, the interventions were: n = 152 MC (midline catheter for IV fluids or medications for 5–28 days) n = 152 PICC (peripherally inserted central catheter for IV fluids or medications for 5–28 days). In the Midline vs. Peripherally Inserted Central Catheters study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in patients who did not develop catheter-related bloodstream infection (100% vs. 99.3%; ARD 0.7, 95% CI -98.17 to 99.57). In the Midline vs. Peripherally Inserted Central Catheters study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in DVT (0% vs. 1.3%; ARD -1.3, 95% CI -4.99 to 2.39) Significant increase in premature catheter removal (13.2% vs. 6.6%; IRR 2.61, 95% CI 1.21 to 5.64) Significant increase in accidental catheter removal (2.6% vs. 0.7%; AD 1.9%, 95% CI 0.04 to 3.76). In the Midline vs. Peripherally Inserted Central Catheters study, the safety outcomes were: significant differences in any complications (13.2% vs. 7.2%), minor complications (13.2% vs. 5.3%). In the Midline vs. Peripherally Inserted Central Catheters study, the conclusion was: in adult patients with an anticipated IV therapy lasting from 5 to 28 days, MC was not superior to PICC with respect to patients who did not develop catheter-related bloodstream infection.

### Impact of a central line infection prevention bundle in newborn infants [^33a34a43]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2016). Low credibility.

OBJECTIVE To compare central line use and central line-associated bloodstream infection in newborn infants before and after the introduction of a central line infection prevention bundle in order to determine the effectiveness of the bundle and to identify areas for further improvement. DESIGN Retrospective cohort analysis of prospectively collected data. SETTING Level 5 neonatal intensive care unit in Sydney, Australia. PATIENTS Newborn infants admitted to the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital Neonatal Intensive Care Unit who had a central venous catheter (CVC) inserted. METHODS Data regarding clinical characteristics, CVC use, and infection were collected before and after the introduction of a bundle of interventions. The bundles encompassed (1) insertion of CVC, (2) maintenance of CVC, (3) an education program, and (4) ongoing surveillance and feedback. RESULTS Baseline and intervention groups were comparable in clinical characteristics. The number of CVCs inserted was reduced in the intervention group (central line utilization rate, 0.16 vs 0.2, P < .0001). Overall CVC dwell time was reduced, resulting from significant reduction in peripherally inserted CVC dwell time (6 days [95% CI, 5.0–11.8 days] vs 7.3 days [4.0–10.4 days], P = 0.0004). Central line-associated bloodstream infections were significantly reduced, predominantly secondary to decreased peripherally inserted CVC-related bloodstream infections (1.2/1,000 central line-days vs 11.5/1,000 central line-days, P < .0001). CONCLUSION This central line infection bundle was effective in reducing CVC use, dwell time, and central line-associated bloodstream infections. Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol 2016;37:1029–1036.

### Use of peripherally inserted central venous catheters and midline catheters for palliative care in patients with cancer: a systematic review [^36e88405]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

PICC and MC are safe tools with high user satisfaction and can be utilized for extended periods. However, we still lack clarity on optimal deployment for pain and symptom management in palliative care cancer patients, specifically in relation to preferential use over peripheral IV or SC administration routes. Questions also remain regarding the optimal timing in a patient's disease trajectory to introduce these catheters and when to favor PICC over MC, especially if a catheter is only required for a few weeks. Further studies are needed to clarify indications for PICC or MC in palliative care.

### Prevention of peripherally inserted central line-associated blood stream infections in very low-birth-weight infants by using a central line bundle guideline with a standard checklist: a case control study [^10f1e609]. BMC Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The use of the peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) technology is widespread because of its simple operation, osmotolerance, and long indwelling time. However, catheter-related infections (CRIs) are one of the severe complications of PICC placement, with incidence rates ranging from 16.4 to 28.8%. If treatment is not timely or correct, the incidence of infection and mortality rate can be high. Therefore, knowledge on the manner in which such CRIs can be reduced or eliminated is important. A central line bundle (CLB) guideline was first proposed by the Institute for Healthcare Improvement, and included five key measures — namely, hand hygiene, maximum sterility, chlorhexidine skin disinfection, choosing the best puncture site, and daily assessment of whether to remove the catheter. These measures have been proven to effectively reduce the occurrence of catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSIs).

Very low-birth-weight infants (VLBWIs) have a low immune response and indistinct symptoms after infection compared with other populations. Some reviews have focused on the effect and safety of a CLB in VLBWIs and its preventive effect on bacterial colonization and infection. In the present study, we combined the CLB guidelines with actual CRBSI conditions to develop a plan for PICC insertion and maintenance and also used a standard checklist to ensure that each measure of the CLB guideline was implemented. The investigation of the effectiveness of the CLB guideline in preventing PICC CRIs in VLBWIs was always common, Pronovost et al has conducted a collaborative cohort study in Michigan, and the results showed a sharply decreased of the catheter-related bloodstream per 1000 catheter-days decreased from 2.7 infections at baseline to 0 at 3 months after implementation of the study, so we would conducted a retrospective study to investigate the guidline use in China, to find the effectiveness and feasibility of central line bundle (CLB) guideline with a standard checklist in the prevention of peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC)-related infections (CRIs) in very low-birth-weight infants (VLBWIs).

### A systematic review of central-line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) diagnostic reliability and error [^dcb2a9d1]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

To establish the reliability of the application of National Health and Safety Network (NHSN) central-line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) criteria within established reporting systems internationally.

Design

Diagnostic-test accuracy systematic review.

Methods

We conducted a search of Medline, SCOPUS, the Cochrane Library, CINAHL (EbscoHost), and PubMed (NCBI). Cohort studies were eligible for inclusion if they compared publicly reported CLABSI rates and were conducted by independent and expertly trained reviewers using NHSN/Centers for Disease Control (or equivalent) criteria. Two independent reviewers screened, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias using the QUADAS 2 tool. Sensitivity, specificity, negative and positive predictive values were analyzed.

Results

A systematic search identified 1,259 publications; 9 studies were eligible for inclusion (n = 7,160 central lines). Publicly reported CLABSI rates were more likely to be underestimated (7 studies) than overestimated (2 studies). Specificity ranged from 0.70 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.58–0.81) to 0.99 (95% CI, 0.99–1.00) and sensitivity ranged from 0.42 (95% CI, 0.15–0.72) to 0.88 (95% CI, 0.77–0.95). Four studies, which included a consecutive series of patients (whole cohort), reported CLABSI incidence between 9.8% and 20.9%, and absolute CLABSI rates were underestimated by 3.3%-4.4%. The risk of bias was low to moderate in most included studies.

Conclusions

Our findings suggest consistent underestimation of true CLABSI incidence within publicly reported rates, weakening the validity and reliability of surveillance measures. Auditing, education, and adequate resource allocation is necessary to ensure that surveillance data are accurate and suitable for benchmarking and quality improvement measures over time.

### A pressure-resistant peripherally inserted central catheter is as useful as a central venous catheter for rapid fluid infusion: an in vitro study [^222b202a]. BMC Anesthesiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In the present study, flow rates of 0–150 mL/min were obtained in the pressure-resistant PICC and CVC. However, the in-line pressures were positively correlated with the catheter length. The flow rate at in-line pressures < 300 mmHg, when hemolysis is expected to occur, did not markedly differ between the 45-cm pressure-resistant PICC and 20-cm CVC.

Regarding the relationship between the flow rate and in-line pressure, longer catheters have a higher in-line pressure than shorter ones. In our previous report concerning the relationship between the flow rate and in-line pressure using a peripheral venous catheter, there was a positive correlation between the catheter length and in-line pressure with an 18-G peripheral venous catheter, which has same diameter as the lumen of the PICC used in the present study. The in-line pressure was approximately 300 mmHg at a flow rate of 150 mL/min (9000 mL/h). The length of the peripheral venous catheter was 4.8 cm in the previous study, while the lengths of the CVC and PICC with the same diameter in the present study were 20 and 13 cm and 55, 45 and 35 cm. In each catheter, the in-line pressure increased to 1745–2523 mmHg as the catheter length was increased. However, in the present study, we confirmed that repeated infusions at an in-line pressure of ≥ 2000 mmHg did not affect the flow rate or in-line pressure using a pressure-resistant PICC or CVC. These results suggest that there is no issue with performing repeated high-pressure infusion.

### Closed intravenous systems for central vascular access: a difference maker for CLABSI rates in neonates? [^6cff32ba]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Central venous catheters (CVC), typically in the manner of peripherally inserted central catheters (Epicutaneo-Caval Catheter, ECC), are widely used in neonatal intensive care settings to provide intravenous (IV) fluids, parenteral nutrition, and medications. CVCs have several benefits over peripheral IV catheters (PIVC) including: long-term securement of difficult IV access, fewer line exchanges, and the ability to infuse, acidic (< pH 5) or alkaline (pH > 9) solutions and hyperosmolar fluids (Osmolarity > 600 mOsm/L). – When compared to PIVCs, CVCs are generally associated with lower rates of complications, though these figures vary. Importantly, CVCs are not risk-free and their use is associated with several clinically minor and serious complications including CLABSI.– Exact figures for complication rates due to all causes are debated due to a lack of universal definitions and surveillance practices.

The CLABSI rate is commonly presented as the number of confirmed infections per 1000 catheter days. Actual figures for the incidence of CLABSI vary internationally, between different healthcare settings, and among different patient groups. The observed rate variability reflects infection surveillance methods, and underlying patient risk. However, inconsistencies in CLABSI diagnosis and confirmation (e.g. setting the level of clinical suspicion, interpretation of a positive blood culture, routine or non-routine ECC tip culture, and how robustly other infections are excluded).

Newborns, particularly those born preterm, are considered a high-risk patient group and a focus of considerable effort to reduce infection risk. Measures that have been shown to reduce the incidence of CVC related complications, including CLABSI in the NICU include; standardizing practices and workflows related to insertion, maintenance, use, and removal of CVCs, including ECCs.

There is emerging favorable evidence suggesting alternative insertion procedures, such as the modified Seldinger technique, and modified workflows have a favorable impact on CLABSI rates. – There is some evidence about the benefits and additional risks of using bedside assembled "add on" devices such as extension lines to enhance functionality of the infusion system. However, there is little evidence regarding the impact of consumables, such as advanced closed system IV administration sets, preassembled at the point of manufacture towards reducing CLABSI rates.

Insufficient literature — definition and criteria: The lack of sufficient scientific evidence in the literature may occur when the evidence is either unavailable (i.e., no pertinent studies found) or inadequate. Inadequate literature cannot be used to assess relationships among clinical interventions and outcomes because a clear interpretation of findings is not obtained due to methodological concerns (e.g., confounding of study design or implementation) or the study does not meet the criteria for content as defined in the "Focus" of the guidelines.

### Strategies to prevent central line-associated bloodstream infections in acute-care hospitals: 2022 update [^2f1c4029]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2022). High credibility.

Central line–associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) prevention — additional approaches for high-rate settings: Use antiseptic- or antimicrobial-impregnated CVCs because the risk of CLABSI is reduced with some currently marketed antiseptic-impregnated and antimicrobial-impregnated catheters, and use them when hospital units or patient populations have a CLABSI rate above institutional goals despite compliance with essential practices, when patients have limited venous access and a history of recurrent CLABSI, or when patients are at heightened risk of severe sepsis from a CLABSI (eg, patients with recently implanted intravascular devices such as a prosthetic heart valve or aortic graft). These additional approaches are recommended for use in locations and/or populations with unacceptably high CLABSI rates and may not be needed if institutional goals have been consistently achieved.

### Safety and efficacy of midline vs peripherally inserted central catheters among adults receiving IV therapy: a randomized clinical trial [^24216619]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Intravenous (IV) accesses are the most common invasive procedures, involving approximately 80% of all hospital admissions, with an average of 2 devices per patient during hospitalization. The indications are numerous and include administration of IV medication, fluid, parenteral nutrition, and blood products. Peripheral IV catheters are frequently used, as they are easily inserted bedside and have a low risk of complications. However, the relatively short dwell time of peripheral IV catheters, lasting approximately 3 to 4 days, requires repetitive insertions to complete medium- and long-term IV therapies. In these situations, central venous catheters or peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) are recommended.

An alternative type of peripherally inserted IV catheter is the midline catheter (MC), which typically range from 8 to 20 cm in length and are inserted into the major veins of the upper arm, with the tip positioned in or distal to the axillary vein.MCs were introduced in the 1950s, but hypersensitivity reactions to the catheter material led to decline in their use. Since then, the manufacturing materials as well as the techniques of insertion have been improved. Current guidelines recommend the use of MCs for medium duration of IV therapies and in patients with difficult peripheral IV access. Nevertheless, these recommendations are largely based on expert opinions due to sparse evidence.

One of the major serious complications associated with use of any type of IV catheter is catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI). In a systematic review of prospective studies published between 1966 and 2005, an estimated CRBSI rate of 0.4% with the use of 514 MCs and 3.1% with the use of 3566 PICCs was reported. Regular use of MCs may decrease the overall incidence of CRBSI. However, when compared with PICCs, MCs have been shown to be associated with a higher incidence of complications. Therefore, to obtain more conclusive findings, further investigation in larger randomized clinical trials (RCTs) comparing the new generation of MCs with PICCs is needed.

The aim of this superiority trial was to compare the safety and efficacy of MCs with PICCs among adult patients requiring medium- to long-term IV therapy lasting from 5 to 28 days. We hypothesized that the group of patients with MCs would experience a lower incidence of CRBSIs compared with the control group of patients with PICCs.

### Rates of venous thromboembolism and central line-associated bloodstream infections among types of central venous access devices in critically ill children [^eb0c6592]. Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Central venous access devices, including peripherally inserted central catheters and central venous catheters, are often needed in critically ill patients, but also are associated with complications, including central-line associated bloodstream infections and venous thromboembolism. We compared different central venous access device types and these complications in the PICU.

Design

Multicenter, cohort study.

Setting

One hundred forty-eight participating Virtual PICU Systems, LLC, hospital PICU sites.

Patients

Pediatric patients with central venous access placed from January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2015.

Interventions

None.

Measurements and Main Results

Patient and central venous access device variables postulated to be associated with central-line associated bloodstream infection and venous thromboembolism were included. Data were analyzed using Pearson chi-square test or Fisher exact test for categorical variables, Mann-Whitney U test for continuous variables, and logistic regression and classification trees for multivariable analysis that examined significant predictors of venous thromboembolism or central-line associated bloodstream infection. Analysis included 74,196 first lines including 4,493 peripherally inserted central catheters and 66,194 central venous catheters. An increased rate of venous thromboembolism (peripherally inserted central catheter: 0.93%, central venous catheter: 0.52%; p = 0.001) (peripherally inserted central catheter: 8.65/1,000 line days, central venous catheter: 6.29/1,000 line days) and central-line associated bloodstream infection (peripherally inserted central catheter: 0.73%, central venous catheter: 0.24%; p = 0.001) (peripherally inserted central catheter: 10.82/1,000 line days, central venous catheter: 4.97/1,000 line days) occurred in peripherally inserted central catheters. In multivariable analysis, central venous catheters had decreased association with central-line associated bloodstream infection (odds ratio, 0.505; 95% CI, 0.336–0.759; p = 0.001) and venous thromboembolism (odds ratio, 0.569; 95% CI, 0.330–0.982; p = 0.043) compared with peripherally inserted central catheters.

Conclusions

Peripherally inserted central catheters are associated with higher rates of central-line associated bloodstream infection and venous thromboembolism than central venous catheters in children admitted to the PICU.

Neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) vascular access teams (VAT) and peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) programs — effects and training patterns — are described as follows: Specialized "IV teams," such as the VAT, have shown "unequivocal effectiveness in reducing the incidence of catheter-related BSI (CR-BSI), associated complications, and costs." In one NICU, a dedicated PICC insertion and maintenance team "resulted in a nearly 50% decrease in the risk of CLABSI" among patients requiring long-term access "(ie, > 30 days)." Training standards vary, and a national survey noted "less stringent training requirements for physicians than registered nurses or nurse practitioners," with "Many of proceduralists have < 5 successful placements before being allowed to insert a PICC independently."

### Strategies to prevent central line-associated bloodstream infections in acute-care hospitals: 2022 update [^403327bb]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Section 4: Recommended strategies to prevent CLABSI

Recommendations are categorized as either (1) essential practices that should be adopted by all acute-care hospitals or (2) additional approaches that can be considered in locations and/or populations within hospitals when CLABSIs are not controlled by use of essential practices. Essential practices include recommendations in which the potential to affect CLABSI risk clearly outweighs the potential for undesirable effects. Additional approaches include recommendations in which the intervention is likely to reduce CLABSI risk but there is concern about the risks for undesirable outcomes, recommendations for which the quality of evidence is low, recommendations in which cost-to-benefit ratio may be high, or recommendations in which evidence supports the impact of the intervention in select settings (eg, during outbreaks) or for select patient populations. Hospitals can prioritize their efforts by initially focusing on implementation of the prevention strategies listed as essential practices. If CLABSI surveillance or other risk assessments suggest ongoing opportunities for improvement, hospitals should consider adopting some or all of the prevention approaches listed as additional approaches. These can be implemented in specific locations or patient populations or can be implemented hospital-wide, depending on outcome data, risk assessment, and/or local requirements. Each infection prevention recommendation is given a quality of evidence grade (see Table 2).

Essential practices for preventing CLABSI recommended for all acute-care hospitals

Some of the following measures have been combined into a "prevention bundle" that focuses on catheter insertion. Numerous studies have documented that use of such bundles is effective, sustainable, and cost-effective in both adults and children.– Bundles are most likely to be successful if implemented in a previously established patient safety culture and their success depends on adherence to individual measures. However, data suggests that not all components of bundles may be necessary to achieve an effect on CLABSI rates. After catheter insertion, maintenance bundles have been proposed to ensure optimal catheter care. More data are needed to determine which components of the maintenance bundle are essential in reducing risk.

### Prevention of peripherally inserted central line-associated blood stream infections in very low-birth-weight infants by using a central line bundle guideline with a standard checklist: a case control study [^5be48060]. BMC Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Backgrounds

Catheter-related infections (CRIs) are one of the severe complications of PICC placement. If treatment is not timely or correct, the incidence of infection and mortality rate can be high. A central line bundle (CLB) guideline was first proposed by the Institute for Healthcare Improvement, and included five key measures. Very low-birth-weight infants (VLBWIs) have a low immune response and indistinct symptoms after infection compared with other populations (Costa P, Kimura AF, de Vizzotto MP, de Castro TE, West A, Dorea E. Prevalence and reasons for non-elective removal of peripherally inserted central catheter in neonates. Rev Gaucha Enferm. 2012;33:126–33). Some reviews have focused on the effect and safety of a CLB in VLBWIs and its preventive effect on bacterial colonization and infection.

Methods

Fifty-seven VLBWIs who underwent PICC insertion at a hospital in Qingdao, China, between November 2012 and June 2013, and for whom a CLB guideline and a standard checklist were adopted, were included in the CLB group. In contrast, 53 VLBWIs who underwent PICC insertion, but for whom a CLB guideline and a standard checklist were not adopted, were included in the control group. The incidence of CRIs was compared between before and after the treatment.

Results

The incidence of infection showed a statistically significant reduction from 10.0 to 2.20 per 1000 catheter days in the control group (P < 0.05). The incidence of catheter-related bloodstream infections decreased from 3.1 to 0 per 1000 catheter days, and that of colonization infections decreased from 6.9 to 2.2 per 1000 catheter days (P < 0.05), both of which indicated a statistically significant difference. The indwelling catheter time was 24.8 ± 7.4 days in the control group and 31.9 ± 15.0 days in the study group (P < 0.05), and these values were significantly different.

Conclusion

The use of a CLB guideline with a standard checklist could be effective and feasible for preventing CRIs in VLBWIs and prolonging indwelling catheter time.

### A real-world study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of three injectable neurokinin-1 receptor antagonist formulations for the prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting in cancer patients [^6ecf30f4]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

The second co-primary endpoint evaluated was infusion site reactions. Contrary to what has been reported in the literature, such events were rare, occurring in less than 2% of cycles across all three drug groups. This finding may be related to the observation that the NK1 inhibitors were given via central line in over 85% of cycles in our sample. In contrast, the high reaction rates to IV EMEND® reported in the literature were primarily in patients who received the drug via peripheral venous administration. The protective effects of central line administration were suggested by the findings of the multivariate analysis. The administration of the NK1 agent via a central line reduced the risk of infusion reactions by approximately 75% (OR = 0.25). This effect may be due to the large fluid volume in a central line compared to a peripheral line or the size of the venous system being accessed. Therefore, another important policy recommendation derived from the current study is that all NK1 agents be administered centrally, whenever possible. It was also interesting to note that patients with active diabetes, or those who received one or more vesicants were at a considerably higher risk of infusion site reactions. Given these findings, another policy recommendation would be to consider CINVANTI® in such high-risk subgroups.

### Midline venous catheter vs peripherally inserted central catheter for intravenous therapy: a randomized clinical trial [^f742ae54]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Peripheral venous catheters (VCs) are appropriate for intravenous therapy (IVT) with nonirritating medication that does not require a central access. Central VCs are generally used for IVT that requires blood dilution in a large vein, such as the superior vena cava. Peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) are central VCs inserted through a peripheral vein, avoiding complications associated with a central vein puncture. In many tertiary care centers, PICCs have become popular and are now often used even for IVT that does not need a central VC. However, PICC insertion may require some guidance, which adds to the cost and time needed in comparison with the midline venous catheter (MVC).,

According to the Infusion Nurses Society 2016 Therapy Standards of Practice, an MVC should be considered when the anticipated duration of treatment ranges from 1 to 4 weeks. The 2016 Michigan Appropriateness Guide for Intravenous Catheters states that an MVC is preferred over a PICC for peripherally compatible infusate of 6 to 14 days. However, these recommendations are mostly based on expert opinions in systematic reviews of cohort studies. Despite lower cost and better accessibility of MVCs compared with PICCs in ambulatory patients, there is little evidence in the literature suggesting that MVCs are a noninferior alternative to PICCs for peripheral IVT in a tertiary care center.,

We hypothesized that, in a tertiary care setting, MVCs could have an advantage to replace PICCs for short-term peripheral IVT. Hence, the primary objective of this study was to assess the noninferiority of MVCs compared with PICCs as a reliable vascular access for peripheral IVT and blood draws for 1 to 4 weeks of IVT that does not require a central VC.

### Peripherally inserted central catheters: a randomized, controlled, prospective trial in pediatric surgical patients [^9bd59dbc]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2004). Low credibility.

Peripherally-inserted central catheters (PICCs) are long-term IV catheters used for drug and fluid administration, blood sampling, or hyperalimentation. The short-term use of PICCs in postoperative patients has not been studied. In this randomized, controlled trial, patients received either a PICC or peripheral IV catheter (PIV). Our outcome measures were patient and parent satisfaction with care, complications of the venous access devices, number of postoperative venipunctures, and cost-effectiveness of use. Satisfaction was significantly more frequent in the PICC group (P < 0.05), and there were significantly fewer postoperative needle punctures in the PICC group compared with the PIV group (P < 0.05). Minor complications were common in the PIV group; major complications were uncommon in both groups. PICCs are more expensive, but better satisfaction can make them a cost-effective option. Additionally, insertion during surgical preparation time in the operating room (OR) means that cost is not increased by adding anesthesiologist and OR time. Anesthesiologists should consider placing PICCs in patients requiring more than 4 days of in-hospital postoperative care, especially if frequent blood sampling or IV access is required.

### Impact of universal disinfectant cap implementation on central line-associated bloodstream infections [^02209e22]. American Journal of Infection Control (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs) result in increased length of stay, cost, and patient morbidity and mortality. One CLABSI prevention method is disinfection of intravenous access points. The literature suggests that placing disinfectant caps over needleless connectors decreases CLABSI risk.

Methods

A quasi-experimental intervention study was conducted in a > 430-bed trauma I center. In addition to an existing standard central line bundle, a new intervention consisting of a luer-lock disinfectant cap with 70% alcohol was implemented in all intravenous (IV) needleless connectors on patients with peripheral and central lines. Compliance to the disinfectant cap was monitored weekly. A generalized linear model using a Poisson distribution was fit to determine if there were significant relationships between CLABSIs and disinfectant cap use. Impacts on costs were also examined.

Results

The rate of CLABSI decreased following implementation of the disinfectant cap. The incidence rate ratios (.577, P = 0.004) for implementing the disinfectant caps was statistically significant, indicating that the rate of patient infections decreased by > 40%. Increased compliance rates were associated with lower infection rates. Disinfectant cap use was associated with an estimated savings of almost $300,000 per year in the hospital studied.

Conclusions

Use of a disinfectant cap on IV needleless connectors in addition to an existing standard central line bundle was associated with decreased CLABSI and costs.

### Use and safety of peripherally inserted central catheters and midline catheters in palliative care cancer patients: a retrospective review [^ba30ee47]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In palliative care, the traditional route for parenteral drug administration is subcutaneous. However, the intravenous route has several potential advantages in this setting, including a faster onset of drug action, greater flexibility in injection volumes, drug and excipient use, less local infiltrations and irritation, and more predictable pharmacokinetics. Peripheral venous access can be challenging to obtain and maintain in palliative care cancer patients. The use of peripherally inserted central venous catheters (PICC) and midline catheters (MC) allows for easy administration of intravenous medications and provision of regular care in both hospital and home settings, potentially reducing the burden on the patient and healthcare system compared to peripheral venous access.

PICCs are inserted in the basilic, cephalic, or brachial vein without general anesthesia or a surgical incision, and their presence reduces the discomfort of frequent venipuncture and cannulation. The MC is a peripheral intravenous line measuring 3–8 inches and is inserted using a similar procedure, but with its tip not advanced beyond the distal axillary vein. The MC is indicated for short-term use (< 30 days). Removal of PICC or MC is a simple, safe procedure that can, if needed, be carried out at home.

There are several studies on PICC placement in cancer patients with the indication to maintain chemotherapy and/or nutrition therapy. These studies suggest PICCs are generally safe and convenient and can substitute other centrally or peripherally inserted venous devices. Based on systematic reviews and expert opinions, The Michigan Appropriateness Guide for Intravenous Catheters states that a PICC could be indicated for palliative treatment during end-of-life care. Tripathi et al. recently conducted a systematic review on the use of MC in a wide patient population. The review demonstrated complication rates for MC comparable to PICC but included only one study conducted in a palliative care unit. In this study, the procedure was well tolerated, and the quality of care measured with the Palliative care Outcome Scale improved after catheter insertion, likely caused by improved symptom treatment.

### Peripherally inserted central venous catheters in the acute care setting: a safe alternative to high-risk short-term central venous catheters [^c7eb1f55]. American Journal of Infection Control (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Peripherally inserted central venous catheters (PICCs) serve as an alternative to short-term central venous catheters (CVCs) for providing intravenous (IV) access in the hospital. It is not clear which device has a lower risk of central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI). We compared CVC- and PICC-related CLABSI rates in the setting of an intervention to remove high-risk CVCs.

Methods

We prospectively followed patients with CVCs in the non-intensive care units (ICUs) and those with PICCs hospital-wide. A team evaluated the need for the CVC and the risk of infection, recommended the discontinuation of unnecessary or high-risk CVCs, and suggested PICC insertion for patients requiring prolonged access. Data on age, gender, type of catheter, duration of catheter utilization, and the development of CLABSIs were obtained.

Results

A total of 638 CVCs were placed for 4917 catheter-days, during which 12 patients had a CLABSI, for a rate of 2.4 per 1000 catheter-days. A total of 622 PICCs were placed for 5703 catheter-days, during which 13 patients had a CLABSI, for a rate of 2.3 per 1000 catheter-days. The median time to development of infection was significantly longer in the patients with a PICC (23 vs 13 days; P = 0.03).

Conclusion

In the presence of active surveillance and intervention to remove unnecessary or high-risk CVCs, CVCs and PICCs had similar rates of CLABSIs. Given their longer time to the development of infection, PICCs may be a safe alternative for prolonged inpatient IV access.

### Bloodstream infections and central line-associated bloodstream infections [^e365a692]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

It is estimated that more than 575,000 individuals develop bloodstream infections (BSI) annually in North America, accounting for nearly 80,000 deaths. Central line-associated BSI (CLABSI) is a major contributor to the cost of health care. Although primary BSI may be seen by the surgeon, a secondary BSI is more likely to be encountered, especially CLABSI. Prompt identification of the source of infection in patients with secondary BSI is paramount. This practice allows early source control and initiation of appropriate antimicrobial therapy, with subsequent improvement in outcomes. An understanding of evidence-based preventative measures and bundles is important.

### Clinical practice guideline on the prevention and management of neonatal extravasation injury: a before-and-after study design [^7c971ee2]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Not all neonates had peripherally inserted CVCs. Therefore, a subgroup analysis was performed for extravasation from a central line. There were 26 and 31 participants with 41 and 45 CVCs in the control and intervention groups, respectively (Table 2). All CVCs were radiologically confirmed to be appropriately positioned. Total CVC days in the control and intervention groups were 405 and 441, respectively.

No significant proportional differences were observed in the characteristics of IV therapy administered via CVCs between the two groups. Two neonates in the control group, but none in the intervention group, had extravasation from a central line. The extravasation from a central line rate in the control and intervention groups was 4.94 and zero per 1,000 CVC days, respectively. However, because of the zero count in the post-intervention period, the odds ratio could not be estimated.

At insertion

In ICU and non-ICU settings, a facility should have a process in place, such as a checklist, to ensure adherence to infection prevention practices at the time of CVC insertion (Quality of Evidence: MODERATE) Ensure and document adherence to aseptic technique Checklists have been suggested to ensure optimal insertion practices. If used, the documentation should be done by someone other than the inserter. Observation of CVC insertion should be done by a nurse, physician, or other HCP who has received appropriate education (see above) to ensure that aseptic technique is maintained. HCP should be empowered to stop the procedure if breaches in aseptic technique are observed.
Perform hand hygiene prior to catheter insertion or manipulation (Quality of Evidence: MODERATE) – Use an alcohol-based waterless product or soap and water. Use of gloves does not obviate hand hygiene.
The subclavian site is preferred to reduce infectious complications when the catheter is placed in the ICU setting (Quality of Evidence: HIGH),– In the non-ICU setting, the risk of infection between the different sites remains unclear. Importantly, in emergent settings, ensuring life-saving vascular access in the fastest possible way may determine the choice of access site. In children and infants, femoral vein catheterization may be considered if upper body sites are contraindicated. Tunneled femoral vein catheters, with an exit site outside the diaper area in the mid-thigh, may be safer and provide additional risk reduction. Controversy exists regarding infectious and noninfectious complications associated with different short-term CVC access sites. The risk and benefit of different insertion sites must be considered on an individual basis with regard to infectious and noninfectious complications. Among others, this applies to patients currently receiving or likely to require hemodialysis in whom the subclavian site is avoided due to risk of stenosis. Do not use peripherally inserted central venous catheters (PICCs) as a strategy to reduce the risk of CLABSI. Risk of infection with PICCs in hospitalized patients approaches that of other CVCs. However, the majority of CLABSIs due to PICCs occur in non-ICU settings. Midline catheters are increasingly being used as an alternative to CVCs for short-term vascular access, with some observational studies suggesting lower bloodstream infection risk associated with midline catheters versus PICCsand versus CVCs, respectively. Randomized controlled trials comparing the risk of bloodstream infections and other complications associated with these devices are needed.
Use an all-inclusive catheter cart or kit (Quality of Evidence: MODERATE) A catheter cart or kit that contains all necessary components for aseptic catheter insertion should be available and easily accessible in all units where CVCs are inserted.
Use ultrasound guidance for catheter insertion (Quality of Evidence: HIGH), Ultrasound-guided internal jugular and femoral vein catheterization reduces the risk of noninfectious complications associated with CVC placementbut the use of ultrasound may lead to a breach in aseptic technique. It is unclear whether ultrasound-guided subclavian vein insertion reduces risk of infectious complications.
Use maximum sterile barrier precautions during CVC insertion (Quality of Evidence: MODERATE) – Use maximum sterile barrier precautions: A mask, cap, sterile gown, and sterile gloves are to be worn by all HCP involved in the catheter insertion procedure. The patient is to be covered with a large ("full-body") sterile drape during catheter insertion. These measures should also be followed when exchanging a catheter over a guidewire. A prospective, randomized study in surgical patients showed no additional benefit for maximum sterile barrier precautions; nevertheless, most available evidence suggests risk reduction with this intervention.
Use an alcoholic chlorhexidine antiseptic for skin preparation (Quality of Evidence: HIGH),– Before catheter insertion, apply an alcoholic chlorhexidine solution containing at least 2% chlorhexidine gluconate to the insertion site. The antiseptic solution must be allowed to dry before making the skin puncture. Alcoholic chlorhexidine for skin antisepsis to prevent CLABSI in NICU patients should be used when the benefits are judged to outweigh potential risk.

### Dressings and securement devices for central venous catheters (CVC) [^f06c74f8]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Central venous catheters (CVCs) play a vital role in the management of acute and chronic illness. Dressings and securement devices must ensure CVCs do not dislodge or fall out, provide a barrier protection from microbial colonisation and infection, and be comfortable for the patient. There is a large range of dressing and securement products available for clinicians to use.

Objectives

To compare the available dressing and securement devices for CVCs, in terms of catheter-related bloodstream infection (BSI), catheter colonisation, entry- and exit-site infection, skin colonisation, skin irritation, failed catheter securement, dressing condition and mortality.

Search Methods

In June 2015 we searched: The Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register; The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); The Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE); NHS Economic Evaluation Database (NHSEED); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid MEDLINE (In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations); Ovid EMBASE; EBSCO CINAHL; six clinical trial registries and reference lists of identified trials. There were no restrictions based on language or date of publication or study setting.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials that evaluated the effects of dressing and securement devices for CVCs. All types of CVCs were included, i.e. short- and long-term CVCs, tunnelled and non-tunnelled, port-a-caths, haemodialysis catheters, and peripherally-inserted central catheters (PICCs).

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane Collaboration methods including independent review of titles and abstracts for relevance, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment of the included studies by two review authors. Results are expressed using risk ratio (RR) for categorical data with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). For outcomes best presented as a rate-per-time-period, rate ratios and standard errors have been used. We performed multiple treatment meta-analyses to rank the effectiveness of each intervention for each outcome.

Main Results

We included 22 studies involving 7436 participants comparing nine different types of securement device or dressing. All included studies were at unclear or high risk of performance bias due to the different appearances of the dressings and securement devices. The extent of blinding of outcome assessment was unclear in most studies. The quality of evidence varied between different comparisons and outcomes. We mainly downgraded the quality of evidence for imprecision, indirectness, risk of bias and inconsistency. It is unclear whether there is a difference in the rate of catheter-related BSI between securement with gauze and tape and standard polyurethane (SPU) (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.26 to 1.63, low quality evidence), or between chlorhexidine gluconate-impregnated (CGI) dressings and SPU (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.40 to 1.05, moderate quality evidence). There is high quality evidence that medication-impregnated dressings reduce the incidence of catheter-related BSI relative to all other dressing types (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.93). There is moderate quality evidence that CGI dressings reduce the frequency of catheter-related BSI per 1000 patient days compared with SPU dressings (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.78). There is moderate quality evidence that catheter tip colonisation is reduced with CGI dressings compared with SPU dressings (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.73), but the relative effects of gauze and tape and SPU are unclear (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.77, very low quality evidence). It is unclear if there is a difference in rates of skin irritation or damage when CGI dressings are compared with SPU dressings (moderate quality evidence) (RR 11.17, 95% CI 0.84 to 149.48). A multiple treatment meta-analysis found sutureless securement devices as likely to be the most effective at reducing the incidence of catheter-related BSI (low quality evidence), with CGI dressings ranked second (low quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Medication-impregnated dressing products reduce the incidence of catheter-related BSI relative to all other dressing types. There is some evidence that CGI dressings, relative to SPU dressings, reduce catheter-related BSI for the outcomes of frequency of infection per 1000 patient days, risk of catheter tip colonisation and possibly risk of catheter-related BSI. A multiple treatment meta-analysis found that sutureless securement devices are likely to be the most effective at reducing catheter-related BSI though this is low quality evidence. Most studies were conducted in intensive care unit (ICU) settings. More, high quality research is needed regarding the relative effects of dressing and securement products for CVCs. Future research may adjust the estimates of effect for the products included in this review and is needed to assess the effectiveness of new products.

### A single institution experience of seven hundred consecutively placed peripherally inserted central venous catheters [^4d7ae2e5]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Peripherally inserted central venous catheters (PICCs) are being increasingly placed at the bedside by trained vascular access professional such as nurses. This is to increase the availability of the service, for cost containment, and to reduce the workload on the interventional radiologist. We describe a single institution experience with over 700 PICC lines placed by trained nurses at the bedside and determine the success rate, malposition rate of the PICC line, degree of support needed from the Interventional radiologist, and factors affecting a successful placement of a PICC line by the nurses.

Methods

Seven hundred and five PICC lines were placed at the South Nassau Communities hospital between July 2011 and November 2012 by trained vascular access nurses with interventional radiology backup. Bedside ultrasound was used for venous access, an electromagnetic catheter tip detection device was used to navigate the catheter into the desired central vein and catheter tip position was confirmed using a portable bedside chest X-ray.

Results

The nurses, with a malposition rate of 3.8%, successfully placed 91.6% (646/705) catheters. Interventional radiology support was needed for 59 cases (8.4%) and 17 cases (2.4%) for failed placement and catheter malposition adjustment, respectively. Risk factor such as presence of pacemaker wires and multiple attempts at insertion were factors predictive of an unsuccessful placement of a PICC line by the nurses.

Conclusions

Bedside placement of PICC line by trained vascular nurses is an effective method with a high success rate, low malposition rate and requires minimal support from interventional radiology.

### Percutaneous central venous catheters versus peripheral cannulae for delivery of parenteral nutrition in neonates [^e656dcbe]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Parenteral nutrition for neonates may be delivered via a short peripheral cannula or a central venous catheter. The latter may either be inserted via the umbilicus or percutaneously. Because of the complications associated with umbilical venous catheter use, many neonatal units prefer to use percutaneously inserted catheters following the initial stabilisation period. The method of parenteral nutrition delivery may affect nutrient input and consequently growth and development. Although potentially more difficult to place, percutaneous central venous catheters may be more stable than peripheral cannulae, and need less frequent replacement. These delivery methods may also be associated with different risks of adverse events, including acquired systemic infection and extravasation injury.

Objectives

To determine the effect of infusion via a percutaneous central venous catheter versus a peripheral cannula on nutrient input, growth and development, and complications including systemic infection, or extravasation injuries in newborn infants who require parenteral nutrition.

Search Strategy

The standard search strategy of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group was used. This included searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Issue 1, 2007), MEDLINE (1966 - February 2007), EMBASE (1980 - February 2007), conference proceedings, and previous reviews.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials that compared the effect of delivering parenteral nutrition via a percutaneous central venous catheter versus a peripheral cannulae in neonates.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were extracted the data using the standard methods of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group, with separate evaluation of trial quality and data extraction by each author, and synthesis of data using relative risk, risk difference and mean difference.

Main Results

Four trials eligible for inclusion were found. These trials recruited a total of 368 infants and reported a number of different outcomes. One study showed that the use of a percutaneous central venous catheter was associated with a decreased risk of cumulative nutritional deficit during the trial period: Mean difference in the percentage of the prescribed nutritional intake actually received: -7.1% (95% confidence interval -11.02, -3.2). In another trial, infants in the percutaneous central venous catheter group needed significantly fewer catheters/cannulae per infant during the trial period: Mean difference in the number of catheters/cannulae per infant: -3.2 (95% confidence interval -5.13, -1.27). Meta-analysis of data from all four trials did not find any evidence of an effect on the incidence of systemic infection: Typical relative risk: 0.94 (95% confidence interval 0.70, 1.25); typical risk difference: -0.02 (95% confidence interval -0.12, 0.08).

Authors' Conclusions

Data from one small study suggest that the use of a percutaneous central venous catheter to deliver parenteral nutrition in newborn infants improves nutrient input. The significance of this in relation to long-term growth and developmental outcomes is unclear. Another study suggested that the use of a percutaneous central venous catheter rather than a peripheral cannula decreases the number of catheters/cannulae needed to deliver the nutrition. No evidence was found to suggest that percutaneous central venous catheter use increased the risk of adverse events, particularly systemic infection.

### Comparison of complication rates of central venous catheters versus peripherally inserted central venous catheters in pediatric patients [^cb5ce45b]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

The purpose of our study is to compare the rate of central line-associated blood stream infections and venous thromboembolism in central venous catheters versus peripherally inserted central catheters in hospitalized children. There is a growing body of literature in adults describing an increased rate of venous thromboembolisms and similar rates of central line-associated blood stream infection associated with peripherally inserted central catheters versus central venous catheters. It is not known if the rate of central line-associated blood stream infection and venous thromboembolism differs between peripherally inserted central catheters and central venous catheters in children. Based on current adult literature, we hypothesize that central line-associated blood stream infection rates for peripherally inserted central catheters and central venous catheters will be similar, and the rate of venous thromboembolism will be higher for peripherally inserted central catheters versus central venous catheters.

Design

This is a cohort study using retrospective review of medical records and prospectively collected hospital quality improvement databases.

Setting

Quaternary-care pediatric hospital from October 2012 to March 2016.

Patients

All patients age 1 day to 18 years old with central venous catheters and peripherally inserted central catheters placed during hospital admission over the study dates were included. Central venous catheters that were present upon hospital admission were excluded. The primary outcomes were rate of central line-associated blood stream infection and rate of venous thromboembolism.

Interventions

None.

Measurements and Main Results

Of 2,709 catheters included in the study, 1,126 were peripherally inserted central catheters and 1,583 were central venous catheters. Peripherally inserted central catheters demonstrated a higher rate of both infection and venous thromboembolism than central venous catheters in all reported measures. In multivariable analysis, peripherally inserted central catheters had increased association with central line-associated blood stream infection (odds ratio of 3.15; 95% CI, 1.74–5.71; p = 0.0002) and increased association with venous thromboembolism (odds ratio of 2.71; 95% CI, 1.65–4.45; p < 0.0001) compared with central venous catheters.

Conclusions

Rates of central line-associated blood stream infection and venous thromboembolism were higher in hospitalized pediatric patients with peripherally inserted central catheters as compared to central venous catheters. Our study confirms the need for further investigation into the safety of central access devices to assist in proper catheter selection.

### Strategies to prevent central line-associated bloodstream infections in acute-care hospitals: 2022 update [^228f780d]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2022). High credibility.

Risk factors for CLABSI emphasize device presence and patient populations: "Patients at risk for CLABSI in acute-care facilities are those with a CVC in place." In the ICU, "The risk of CLABSI in ICU patients is high," with reasons including "the frequent insertion of multiple catheters… the use of specific types of catheters… and the fact that catheters are frequently placed in emergency circumstances, repeatedly accessed each day, and often needed for extended periods." For non-ICU settings, "most CLABSIs occur in hospitalized patients in units outside the ICU or in outpatients." Prevention efforts "should include other vulnerable populations such as patients receiving hemodialysis through catheters, intraoperative patients, and oncology patients." Beyond CVCs, "short-term peripheral catheters, peripherally inserted central venous catheters (PICCs), midline catheters, and peripheral arterial catheters also carry a risk of infection." Independent risk factors "in at least 2 published studies" include "Prolonged hospitalization before catheterization," "Prolonged duration of catheterization," "Heavy microbial colonization at insertion site," "Heavy microbial colonization of the catheter hub," and "Multilumen catheters."

### Foscarnet sodium (Foscavir) [^4d61fc4b]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Instructions for Administration and Preparation

FOSCAVIR is administered by controlled intravenous infusion, either by using a central venous line or by using a peripheral vein. The rate of infusion must be no more than 1 mg/kg/minute. An individualized dose of FOSCAVIR should be calculated on the basis of body weight (mg/kg), renal function, indication of use and dosing frequency (refer to DOSAGE subsection). To reduce the risk of nephrotoxicity, creatinine clearance (mL/min/kg) should be calculated even if serum creatinine is within the normal range, and doses should be adjusted accordingly.

An individualized dose at the required concentration (24 mg/mL or 12 mg/mL) for the route of administration (central line or peripheral line) needs to be aseptically prepared prior to dispensing. The standard 24 mg/mL solution may be used with or without dilution when using a central venous catheter for infusion. When a peripheral vein catheter is used, the 24 mg/mL injection must be diluted to a 12 mg/mL concentration with 5% dextrose in water or with a normal saline solution prior to administration to avoid local irritation of peripheral veins. Dilutions and/or removals of excess quantities should be accomplished under aseptic conditions. Solutions thus prepared should be used within 24 hours of first entry into a sealed bottle or infusion bag.

Hydration

Hydration may reduce the risk of nephrotoxicity. Clinically dehydrated patients should have their condition corrected before initiating FOSCAVIR therapy. It is recommended that 750–1000 mL of normal saline or 5% dextrose solution should be given prior to the first infusion of FOSCAVIR to establish diuresis. With subsequent infusions, 750–1000 mL of hydration fluid should be given with 90–120 mg/kg of FOSCAVIR, and 500 mL with 40–60 mg/kg of FOSCAVIR. Hydration fluid may need to be decreased if clinically warranted. Oral rehydration with similar regimens may be considered in certain patients.

After the first dose, the hydration fluid should be administered concurrently with each infusion of FOSCAVIR.

### Implementation and long-term efficacy of a multifaceted intervention to reduce central line-associated bloodstream infections in intensive care units of a low-middle-income country [^8a9c07a2]. American Journal of Infection Control (2024). Medium credibility.

BACKGROUND

Central lines are vital tools for managing and treating patients because they allow providers to monitor a range of health parameters, administer medications, and deliver blood products, nutritional support, and long-term dialysis, especially in intensive care units (ICU). However, central line insertions are also associated with central line-associated infections (CLABSIs).CLABSIs are potentially fatal but largely preventable infections that arise after central line insertion. – They are the third most common type of health care–associated infections (HCAIs), accounting for 24% of all hospital-acquired infections with a mortality rate of up to 37%. – The World Health Organization (WHO) and the International Nosocomial Infection Control Consortium (INICC) estimate hospital wide prevalence of HCAIs to be 10% in high-income countries compared to 19.1% among ICU patients in lower-middle-income countries (LMICs), a 3 to 5 times greater risk of acquiring HCAIs such as CLABSIs. The odds of in-hospital mortality associated with CLABSI has been reported as 2.75 times higher compared to those without a CLABSI, demonstrating the urgent need to develop prevention strategies to combat these infections.

Over time, various strategies to curb CLABSI rates – have been tested, with varying success. A model to prevent CLABSIs was presented by the Keystone ICU project at Michigan, a collaborative project that used a multifaceted intervention involving a checklist to prevent CLABSIs, a Comprehensive Unit-based Safety Program (CUSP) to address culture change, and performance feedback. This program demonstrated CLABSI rate reduction as well as sustaining these reduced rates for years, resulting in reduced mortality and substantial health care cost savings. – Following this success, the US Department of Health and Human Services launched the National Initiative to Reduce HCAIs, leading to an overall 80% reduction in CLABSI rates across the US. The project was also expanded internationally in the United Kingdom (UK) and Spain with the collaboration of the UK National Health Service and the WHO, respectively.

Surveillance program scope — considerations for central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) monitoring suggest broader device inclusion when increases are suspected. Future surveillance systems should consider including bloodstream infections associated with these types of catheters. If considering further infection prevention interventions due to concern for an increase in infections, hospitals may want to consider extending their surveillance programs to include all types of catheters used to gauge the size of the problem.

### Clinically-indicated replacement versus routine replacement of peripheral venous catheters [^c1386ef6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

US Centers for Disease Control guidelines recommend replacement of peripheral intravenous (IV) catheters no more frequently than every 72 to 96 hours. Routine replacement is thought to reduce the risk of phlebitis and bloodstream infection. Catheter insertion is an unpleasant experience for patients and replacement may be unnecessary if the catheter remains functional and there are no signs of inflammation. Costs associated with routine replacement may be considerable. This is an update of a review first published in 2010.

Objectives

To assess the effects of removing peripheral IV catheters when clinically indicated compared with removing and re-siting the catheter routinely.

Search Methods

For this update the Cochrane Vascular Trials Search Co-ordinator searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register (March 2015) and CENTRAL (2015, Issue 3). We also searched clinical trials registries (April 2015).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials that compared routine removal of peripheral IV catheters with removal only when clinically indicated in hospitalised or community dwelling patients receiving continuous or intermittent infusions.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data.

Main Results

Seven trials with a total of 4895 patients were included in the review. The quality of the evidence was high for most outcomes but was downgraded to moderate for the outcome catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI). The downgrade was due to wide confidence intervals, which created a high level of uncertainty around the effect estimate. CRBSI was assessed in five trials (4806 patients). There was no significant between group difference in the CRBSI rate (clinically-indicated 1/2365; routine change 2/2441). The risk ratio (RR) was 0.61 (95% CI 0.08 to 4.68; P = 0.64). No difference in phlebitis rates was found whether catheters were changed according to clinical indications or routinely (clinically-indicated 186/2365; 3-day change 166/2441; RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.39). This result was unaffected by whether infusion through the catheter was continuous or intermittent. We also analysed the data by number of device days and again no differences between groups were observed (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.27; P = 0.75). One trial assessed all-cause bloodstream infection. There was no difference in this outcome between the two groups (clinically-indicated 4/1593 (0.02%); routine change 9/1690 (0.05%); P = 0.21). Cannulation costs were lower by approximately AUD 7.00 in the clinically-indicated group (mean difference (MD) -6.96, 95% CI -9.05 to -4.86; P ≤ 0.00001).

Authors' Conclusions

The review found no evidence to support changing catheters every 72 to 96 hours. Consequently, healthcare organisations may consider changing to a policy whereby catheters are changed only if clinically indicated. This would provide significant cost savings and would spare patients the unnecessary pain of routine re-sites in the absence of clinical indications. To minimise peripheral catheter-related complications, the insertion site should be inspected at each shift change and the catheter removed if signs of inflammation, infiltration, or blockage are present.

### Central venous catheters in neonates: from simple monolumen to port catheter [^12c9376b]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2010). Low credibility.

The use of central venous catheters (CVCs) represents an important step in the management of the surgical, onco-hematology and critically ill patients. CVCs in neonates, like in adult patients, are mainly used to infuse hyperosmolar solutions, to take blood samples and for hemodynamic monitoring. The need for CVCs is higher in neonates than in adults. Poor peripheral access and the high demand for IV access and blood samples are already valuable indications for a CVC.

### Don't place central lines or peripherally inserted PICCs… [^ead23a3f]. AAFP (2018). Low credibility.

Preservation of vascular access is critical for long-term dialysis patients. Placement of central and PICC lines has been associated with an increased incidence of complications including vascular injury, thrombosis, and central venous stenosis that can limit future use for dialysis access. Placement of central and PICC lines also potentially increases cost due to the treatment of complications from the lines, requirement for radiological tests to identify patent vessels for dialysis, and the necessity for repeat surgical procedures to create vascular access for dialysis. Studies in children are limited, but research about PICC lines demonstrates a 23–57% incidence of thrombosis in adults and increased complications in children who are exposed to multiple PICC line placements. Studies from adult patients have demonstrated the high risk of vascular injury after central line and PICC line placement.

National guidelines from the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative have recommended avoiding placement of central lines in chronic kidney disease patients, if possible, due to the high risk of complications. The recommendation to avoid central line placement is the basis of vascular access preservation in the "Fistula First Innovation" program for adult dialysis patients. National guidelines from the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative state the following: "In patients with CKD stage 4 or 5, forearm and upper-arm veins suitable for placement of vascular access should not be used for venipuncture or for the placement of intravenous catheters, subclavian catheters, or peripherally inserted central catheter lines. Because of the substantial risk for loss of useable upper-extremity veins and central venous stenosis with PICCs, the Work Group recommends strongly that PICCs not be used in patients with CKD".

Special consideration may be necessary in emergency circumstances in which no other safe access is achievable.

### Clinical practice guideline on the prevention and management of neonatal extravasation injury: a before-and-after study design [^aacb0745]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

A before-and-after study design was adopted as the intervention had to be conducted in the same study unit, which made randomization impossible. A comparison of the neonate participants' demographic and clinical characteristics and the nature of the IV therapy between the control and intervention groups revealed no significant inter-group differences, indicating homogeneity between the two groups. With the completion of the educational program and the implementation of the CPG, there were decreases in the total numbers of peripheral intravenous extravasation and extravasation from a central line injuries and a reduction in the rate of such injuries. The reduction in the peripheral intravenous extravasation rate was more than four-fold, from 14.04 to 2.90 per 1,000 peripheral intravenous catheter days. The same trend was also found in the rate of extravasation from a central line — a decrease from 4.94 to zero per 1,000 CVC catheter days. The risk of injury was also assessed using logistic regression after adjusting for the difference in peripheral intravenous catheter days between the control and intervention groups. The adjusted odds ratio for peripheral intravenous extravasation injuries during the post-intervention period was 0.20 — a statistically significant result that indicated an 80% reduction in the likelihood of developing a peripheral intravenous extravasation injury during the post-intervention period compared with the pre-intervention period. In other words, the intervention effectively reduced the incidence of neonatal peripheral intravenous extravasation injuries. However, as the rate of extravasation from a central line injuries in the intervention group was zero, we could not calculate the risk of injury using logistic regression. The findings suggest that the use of a multifaceted educational program and the implementation of an evidence-based CPG led to better clinical outcomes, including a reduction in the number and rate of both peripheral intravenous extravasation and extravasation from a central line injuries. This marked improvement demonstrated that the neonates clearly benefited from the intervention.

Opportunities for further research — How are the up and downstream signaling pathways for erythropoiesis dysregulated following thermal injury? Are there changes in these pathways between the acute phase of care, the convalescence phase, and chronically? Does the perioperative use of TXA during early burn wound excision (defined as surgical burn debridement within 5 days of injury) reduce blood loss and blood transfusion requirements or increase thrombotic complications? What is the effect of a restrictive RBC transfusion protocol among (1) elderly burn patients, (2) burn patients with significant associated inhalation injury, and/or (3) burn patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease? What is the effect of the method of procuring blood draws for diagnostic tests on a restrictive RBC transfusion protocol? Do peripheral draws compared with central line draws reduce diagnostic blood loss and hence transfusion requirements or increase complications?
