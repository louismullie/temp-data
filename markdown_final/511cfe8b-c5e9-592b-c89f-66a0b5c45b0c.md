## Question

A 68-year-old man presents to your clinic with a 6-month history of progressive lower back pain and bilateral leg pain that worsens with walking and improves with sitting. On examination, he has decreased sensation in both lower extremities and mild weakness in ankle dorsiflexion. His past medical history is significant for hypertension and a pacemaker for atrial fibrillation. You suspect degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis based on his history and physical examination.

Based on current NASS guidelines, what is the most appropriate initial imaging study for this patient, and what alternative imaging modalities should be considered if the first-line study is contraindicated or inconclusive? Justify your answer according to the guideline recommendations.

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which initial imaging study is most appropriate for suspected degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis in a 68-year-old man with neurogenic claudication and mild neurologic deficits, and what alternatives to choose if the first-line test is contraindicated or inconclusive. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether advanced imaging is indicated at all given the clinical picture. Then, I should verify the NASS-recommended first-line modality and its rationale. Next, I will check what to do if MRI is contraindicated, especially with a pacemaker. After that, I should consider what to use if MRI is inconclusive. Finally, I will review adjunct imaging options and summarize the hierarchy with appropriate citations.

> Let me first confirm the indication for imaging. The patient has classic neurogenic claudication with progressive symptoms and objective neurologic deficits, which meets criteria for advanced imaging in suspected lumbar spinal stenosis. NASS recommends considering imaging as a first-line diagnostic strategy in this context, and ACR advises MRI when symptoms persist beyond about 6 weeks and the patient is a candidate for intervention, which fits here [^fd62fca1] [^9cfa3633].

> Now, I should verify the first-line modality. NASS explicitly suggests MRI as the most appropriate, noninvasive test to confirm anatomic canal narrowing or nerve root impingement in patients with a compatible history and examination, assigning a Grade B recommendation. This aligns with contemporary primary care guidance that MRI is the imaging of choice for diagnosing lumbar spinal stenosis, and it is consistent with ACR's preference for MRI in candidates for procedures [^e44ca5b9] [^83d1e896] [^9cfa3633].

> Wait, let me verify the role of plain radiographs before jumping to MRI. I initially thought a standing lateral X-ray might be reasonable to screen for spondylolisthesis, but hold on, that pertains to degenerative spondylolisthesis rather than isolated stenosis. For suspected degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis without spondylolisthesis, NASS does not recommend plain films as the initial test, so I should correct that and proceed with MRI as first-line here [^9a32d39a] [^e44ca5b9].

> Next, I should review alternatives if MRI is contraindicated. Given the pacemaker, MRI may be unsafe depending on device type and MRI compatibility. In that scenario, NASS suggests CT myelography as the most appropriate test to confirm stenosis or nerve root impingement when MRI is contraindicated or inconclusive, with a Grade B recommendation. If both MRI and CT myelography are unsuitable, non-myelographic CT is suggested as the next option, also Grade B, acknowledging lower soft-tissue detail but still useful for bony canal assessment [^409eb81f] [^945ba3e8] [^a3dc42c3].

> I need to ensure I consider what to do if MRI is technically feasible but inconclusive. NASS supports using MRI or CT with axial loading as an adjunct when routine unloaded imaging shows suspected but unverified central or lateral stenosis, particularly if the dural sac area is less than 110 mm². This can unmask dynamic stenosis not seen in supine studies, and I should keep that in reserve if the initial MRI is equivocal yet clinical suspicion remains high [^57f25873] [^d95e8f51].

> Let me synthesize the hierarchy clearly. First-line is MRI of the lumbar spine to confirm stenosis and map nerve root involvement. If MRI is contraindicated, proceed to CT myelography. If both MRI and CT myelography are contraindicated or unavailable, use non-myelographic CT. If routine MRI or CT is negative but clinical suspicion persists, consider axial loaded MRI or CT to detect dynamic stenosis. Throughout, I should confirm that imaging is being used to guide potential interventions, which is consistent with guideline intent and stewardship principles [^e44ca5b9] [^409eb81f] [^945ba3e8] [^57f25873].

---

The most appropriate initial imaging study for suspected degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis is **MRI** [^e44ca5b9] because it provides superior soft-tissue detail, directly visualizes neural structures, and identifies canal/foraminal narrowing without radiation [^83d1e896]. If MRI is contraindicated (e.g. pacemaker) or inconclusive, **CT myelography** is the preferred alternative [^409eb81f] to confirm stenosis or nerve root impingement [^a3dc42c3]. Non-contrast CT is a secondary option when MRI and CT myelography are unsuitable, but it is less sensitive for soft-tissue pathology [^945ba3e8] [^69d6839f]. Routine plain radiographs are not recommended for initial diagnosis [^e44ca5b9].

---

## Rationale for MRI as the initial imaging modality

MRI is the **preferred initial imaging modality** for suspected degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis because it:

- **Provides superior soft-tissue resolution**: MRI clearly visualizes the spinal canal, nerve roots, and intervertebral discs, allowing accurate assessment of canal and foraminal narrowing [^e4e60a71].

- **Directly visualizes neural structures**: MRI can identify nerve root impingement, edema, and inflammation, which are critical for confirming the diagnosis and guiding treatment decisions [^e4e60a71].

- **Avoids radiation exposure**: MRI does not involve ionizing radiation, making it safer for repeated use, particularly in elderly patients [^notfound].

- **High diagnostic accuracy**: MRI has high sensitivity and specificity for detecting lumbar spinal stenosis, with sensitivity ranging from 81% to 97% [^053e8a3d] [^882558be].

---

## Alternative imaging modalities when MRI is contraindicated or inconclusive

In cases where MRI is contraindicated (e.g. pacemaker, severe claustrophobia) or inconclusive, **CT myelography** is the recommended alternative imaging modality [^409eb81f]. CT myelography involves injecting contrast dye into the spinal canal followed by CT imaging, providing detailed visualization of the spinal canal and nerve roots [^notfound]. It is particularly useful when MRI is contraindicated or when additional detail is needed to confirm the diagnosis [^111264ba].

---

## Role of CT myelography

CT myelography is **particularly indicated** when:

- **MRI is contraindicated**: Such as in patients with pacemakers, certain aneurysm clips, or severe claustrophobia [^111264ba].

- **MRI is inconclusive**: When MRI findings are equivocal or do not clearly demonstrate the extent of stenosis or nerve root impingement [^409eb81f].

- **Detailed bony anatomy is required**: CT myelography provides excellent visualization of bony structures, including facet joints and osteophytes, which may be less clearly defined on MRI [^notfound].

---

## Limitations of CT myelography

Despite its utility, CT myelography has several limitations, including **invasiveness** because it requires a lumbar puncture and contrast injection, which carries risks such as headache, infection, and allergic reactions. It also involves **radiation exposure**, which is a concern particularly in younger patients or when repeated imaging is needed. Compared with MRI, CT myelography has **lower soft-tissue resolution**, which may limit its ability to detect subtle neural or soft-tissue abnormalities [^882558be].

---

## Role of non-contrast CT

Non-contrast CT may be considered when both MRI and CT myelography are contraindicated or inconclusive [^945ba3e8]. CT provides good visualization of bony structures and can identify severe canal narrowing, osteophytes, and facet hypertrophy. However, it has **limited ability to visualize soft tissues and neural structures**, making it less sensitive for detecting subtle stenosis or nerve root impingement [^882558be].

## Summary of imaging recommendations

| **Imaging modality** | **Indications** | **Advantages** | **Limitations** |
|-|-|-|-|
| MRI | First-line imaging for suspected lumbar spinal stenosis | - Superior soft-tissue resolution <br/> - No radiation <br/> - High diagnostic accuracy | Contraindications (e.g. pacemaker, severe claustrophobia) |
| CT myelography | Alternative when MRI is contraindicated or inconclusive | - Detailed visualization of spinal canal and nerve roots <br/> - Useful for bony anatomy | - Invasive <br/> - Radiation exposure <br/> - Lower soft-tissue resolution |
| Non-contrast CT | Secondary option when MRI and CT myelography are contraindicated or inconclusive | - Good visualization of bony structures <br/> - Widely available | - Limited soft-tissue resolution <br/> - Radiation exposure |

---

MRI is the **preferred initial imaging modality** for suspected degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis due to its superior soft-tissue resolution, ability to directly visualize neural structures, and lack of radiation exposure [^e44ca5b9]. CT myelography is the recommended alternative when MRI is contraindicated or inconclusive, providing detailed visualization of the spinal canal and nerve roots [^409eb81f]. Non-contrast CT is a secondary option when both MRI and CT myelography are unsuitable, but it has limited soft-tissue resolution and involves radiation exposure [^945ba3e8].

NASS clinical guideline — diagnostic imaging for degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis: The lateral radiograph is the most appropriate, noninvasive test for detecting degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis (Grade of Recommendation: B (Suggested)), and in the absence of reliable evidence the work group's opinion is that the lateral radiograph should be obtained in the standing position whenever possible (Work Group Consensus Statement). The most appropriate, noninvasive test for imaging stenosis accompanying degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis is MRI (Work Group Consensus Statement). Facet joint effusion greater than 1.5mm on supine MRI may be suggestive of the presence of degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis, and further evaluation should be considered, including using plain standing radiographs (Grade of Recommendation: B). There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against the utility of upright seated MRI in diagnosis and for or against the use of axial loaded MRI to evaluate dural sac cross sectional area (Grade of Recommendation: I (Insufficient Evidence) for both). Plain myelography or CT myelography are useful to assess spinal stenosis in degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis, especially in those who have contraindications to MRI (Grade of Recommendation: B (Suggested)). In patients with associated spinal stenosis for whom MRI is either contraindicated or inconclusive, CT myelography is the most appropriate test to confirm the presence of anatomic narrowing of the spinal canal or the presence of nerve root impingement (Work Group Consensus Statement). If MRI and CT myelography are contraindicated, inconclusive or inappropriate, CT is suggested as the most appropriate test to confirm the presence of anatomic narrowing of the spinal canal (Work Group Consensus Statement).

Diagnosis and imaging — assessing evidence for diagnostic tests in degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis defines accuracy in terms of sensitivity and specificity and links predictive value to disease prevalence, emphasizing that one purpose of history and physical examination is to increase the prevalence of disease in patients sent for advanced testing and that this review attempted to identify symptoms and signs with a high likelihood ratio for lumbar spinal stenosis; cross-sectional imaging exams have a low intrinsic specificity in asymptomatic populations, so the accuracy of a spine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) study should incorporate direct visualization of neurologic structures, while the frequent use of surgery as a gold standard can be questioned, outcome can also be used as a gold standard but is confounded by treatment and patient variables, and although a case can be made to use the best available cross-sectional imaging exam as a gold standard this too can be problematic; positive CT or MRI findings in the population with symptoms or findings expected in patients diagnosed with lumbar spinal stenosis are stated to have greater relevance relative to treatment and should lead to better outcomes.

### Clinical assessment and management of lumbar spinal stenosis: clinical dilemmas and considerations for surgical referral [^2693ccf8]. The Lancet: Rheumatology (2024). High credibility.

Lumbar spinal stenosis is the leading indication for spine surgery in older adults. Surgery is recommended in clinical guidelines if non-surgical treatments have been provided with insufficient benefit. The difficulty for clinicians is that the current number of randomised controlled trials is low, which creates uncertainty about which treatments to provide. For non-surgical clinicians this paucity of data leads to a clinical dilemma of whether to continue managing the patient or refer to a spine surgeon. This Viewpoint aims to provide an update on the assessment of lumbar spinal stenosis, treatment recommendations, indications for referral to a spine surgeon, and current clinical dilemmas facing non-surgical clinicians and spinal surgeons.

### Spinal stenosis: surgical versus nonsurgical treatment [^8d1fdcac]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2006). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Lumbar spinal stenosis is being diagnosed increasingly in older people as advanced imaging studies become more widely available and clinicians become more familiar with the presentation of this common condition. For symptomatic patients, the goal of treatment is pain relief and improved function, but there is little empiric evidence to support many of the common interventions used. The relative risks and benefits of various surgical and nonsurgical treatments are poorly understood, and the result has been wide variations in the evaluation and treatment of spinal stenosis across geographic regions. Current practice recommendations are based on expert opinion that incorporates available evidence into existing clinical and biologic paradigms. For most individuals, initial treatment should focus on patient education, medications to control pain, and exercise and physical treatments to regain or maintain activities of daily living. Surgical treatment most commonly is considered in patients not improving with nonsurgical care. Decompressive laminectomy is the standard surgical procedure for patients with spinal stenosis. The addition of fusion with or without instrumentation is considered when spinal stenosis is accompanied by degenerative spondylolisthesis or related to concerns about instability. We review the available evidence for nonsurgical and surgical interventions, and highlight comparative results wherever applicable.

Natural history of degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis — evidence review scope and findings: For inclusion, studies required symptomatic patients with characteristic clinical features and confirmatory imaging demonstrating diminished space in the lumbar spinal canal. The group reviewed the 2007 version of the guideline which included 38 references from 1966–2006 and an additional 21 articles from database searches for studies published between January 2006 and February 2010, but all identified studies failed to meet inclusion criteria because they did not adequately pre-sent data about natural history and did not report results of untreated control patients; works frequently cited as natural history studies were actually reports of one or more medical/interventional treat-ment measures. The 2007 guideline had considered patients with minimal medical/interventional treat-ment representative of the natural course, but the 2010 work group determined that any treatment may affect natural history and such studies would be more appropriately in-cluded in the medical/interventional treatment section. Because of these limitations, the work group was unable to definitively an-swer the question related to natural history and instead noted that consensus statements would follow.

Lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) is a frequent cause of low back pain among adults, caused by a narrowing impinging on the spinal cord or nerve roots. Several conditions cause LSS, including disc herniation, spondylolisthesis, tumor, fractures, and other degenerative changes. Back pain is frequently experienced. MRI is the radiologic modality of choice. Radiographic evidence of LSS may not correlate well with symptoms. An increase in utilization of surgery has been noted. However, surgery has no significant benefit over more conservative options. An appropriate risk/benefit discussion between the patient and an interdisciplinary medical team is optimal.

Introduction

Evidence-based medicine (EBM) is the application of clinical methodology and decision-making thoroughly tested by duly controlled peer-reviewed studies. With the exponentially increasing number of publications, EBM aims to shift the traditional paradigm of making decisions based purely on the judgment of the physician or the experience of senior doctors to the use of results obtained from systematic and unbiased research in a patient-centered diagnosis and treatment model with the highest available evidence. The definition of EBM has evolved, but the most widely accepted definition was from Sackett et al. in 1996 and revised in 2000. In summary, it stated that clinicians should use the best, unbiased, clinically sound, and up-to-date data available on a patient basis in prevention, diagnosis, and treatment.

Neurosurgery and Orthopedic Surgery are the pioneers of spine surgery throughout the world. Neurosurgeons have utilized EBM and clinical guidelines to make sound decisions for the last three decades. However, the increasing number of guidelines have questioned the validity of these recommendations as they may stray away from the rigorous process outlined by The Institute of Medicine (IOM). Orthopedic Surgery also recognized the importance of EBM in the early 2000s, and journal sections reserved for "Evidence-Based Orthopedics" emerged. The classical paradigm of trying non-operative treatment first and operative treatment, if the first step fails, has shifted towards surgical treatment vs. other treatment options.

Evidence-Based Spine Surgery (EBSS) has also emerged parallel to the development of EBM. The North American Spine Society (NASS) and Congress of Neurological Surgeons (CNS) frequently publish guidelines with evidence-based suggestions to provide the highest evidence-based decisions in spinal pathologies. For example, EBSS supported by randomized controlled trials has shown discectomy for symptomatic lumbar disc herniation (LDH), decompression of spinal stenosis, and decompression with fusion of degenerative spondylolisthesis offer clinical benefit in relieving lower back and radicular pain compared to conservative treatment. However, pursuing EBSS as the sole deciding factor for diagnosing and treating spinal pathologies is unrealistic. Most of the publications on spine surgery are case-controlled retrospective cohorts or case series. Thus, the number of high-quality evidence parallel to spine surgery development is lacking. Considering the value of EBM and the probability of further implementation into decision-making, this study sheds light on the reception and application of EBM by spinal surgeons and the use of evidence-based modalities in their clinical practice.

Imaging studies in low back pain — overall role and indications emphasize limited diagnostic value for routine use: Imaging modalities have frequent false positive and negative results, the primary utility of imaging lies in interventional and/or surgical planning or in determining the presence of serious medical conditions, and lumbar magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) represents the most useful tool. Routine ordering of imaging for low back pain should be discouraged, and current recommendations from the American College of Physicians are that (1) imaging is only indicated for severe progressive neurological deficits or when red flags are suspected, and (2) routine imaging does not result in clinical benefit and may lead to harm.

Clinical aspects of degenerative spine disease and reporting

The role of imaging is to provide accurate morphological information and influence therapeutic decision-making. The presence of degenerative change is not itself an indicator of symptoms. In the majority of cases, when patients with degenerative spine diseases are referred for imaging, clinicians are looking for answers to two simple questions: what is the cause of the patient's pain or neurological symptoms, and what treatment option should be primarily considered in this particular situation? Therefore, these imaging findings must be interpreted in the context of the patient's clinical condition. In the majority of cases, even in advanced cases of degenerative spine disease with multilevel involvement, it is possible to identify one leading cause of the patient's problem or to provide a list of potential choices or culprits so that the referring physician can select the right answer based on the presentation, clinical symptoms and physical examination of the patient.

### Guideline update for the performance of fusion procedures for degenerative disease of the lumbar spine. part 7: lumbar fusion for intractable low-back pain without stenosis or spondylolisthesis [^3741953a]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine (2014). Low credibility.

Establishing an appropriate treatment strategy for patients presenting with low-back pain, in the absence of stenosis or spondylolisthesis, remains a controversial subject. Inherent to this situation is often an inability to adequately identify the source of low-back pain to justify various treatment recommendations, such as lumbar fusion. The current evidence does not identify a single best treatment alternative for these patients. Based on a number of prospective, randomized trials, comparable outcomes, for patients presenting with 1- or 2-level degenerative disc disease, have been demonstrated following either lumbar fusion or a comprehensive rehabilitation program with a cognitive element. Limited access to such comprehensive rehabilitative programs may prove problematic when pursuing this alternative. For patients whose pain is refractory to conservative care, lumbar fusion is recommended. Limitations of these studies preclude the ability to present the most robust recommendation in support of lumbar fusion. A number of lesser-quality studies, primarily case series, also support the use of lumbar fusion in this patient population.

### Parkinson disease… [^aeb31b82]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

Pathophysiology Parkinson disease is characterized by a progressive loss of dopamine-producing neurons in the basal ganglia, particularly in the substantia nigra, 2 and development of Lewy bodies in the dopaminergic neurons. Lewy bodies are the pathologic feature of Parkinson disease. 3 However, Lewy bodies are nonspecific for Parkinson disease and are found in multiple neurodegenerative diseases; therefore, Parkinson disease represents a disease syndrome with different clinical subtypes.
4. Diagnosis The diagnosis of Parkinson disease is clinical, and key features include bradykinesia, rigidity, and tremor. The most common presenting symptom in Parkinson disease is a unilateral resting tremor, often localized to the distal muscles of the hand, causing a pill-rolling motion. Some patients note an internal tremulousness sensation before the manifestation of the pill-rolling tremor.

5 Rigidity usually starts on the side of the body affected by the tremor and can affect gait, contribute to muscle pain, and impair posture. Cogwheel rigidity, in which affected muscles ratchet or alternate rapidly between rigidity and relaxation when moved passively, is the most common type in Parkinson disease. A small number of patients with Parkinson disease present with lead pipe rigidity, in which affected muscles stay rigid throughout the passive motion. The main diagnostic signs of Parkinson disease are motor symptoms; however, nonmotor symptoms are also common and debilitating. Nonmotor symptoms that often present before motor symptoms include rapid eye movement sleep disorder, depression, constipation, fatigue, and olfactory dysfunction. A large survey of patients with Parkinson disease found that almost all patients reported nonmotor symptoms, with psychiatric symptoms occurring most often.

6 Associated nonmotor symptoms that can occur later in the disease can include autonomic dysfunction such as orthostatic hypotension and urinary dysfunction, which can impact quality-of-life and level-of-care issues for patients. Some nonmotor symptoms such as dementia and psychosis occur with advanced Parkinson disease but are notably debilitating. A physical examination should include assessment for decreased spontaneous or uncontrollable movements, tremors, or flat or masked facial expressions. A gait examination should assess for shuffling gait, stooped posture, en bloc turns, freezing, or postural instability. Bradykinesia, or the overall slowing of movement, includes decreased manual dexterity, shuffling steps, freezing gait, and festinating gait.

### Lumbar spinal stenosis: diagnosis and management [^d2dd60d8]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Lumbar spinal stenosis is a clinical syndrome that affects more than 200,000 people in the United States annually. It is a common cause of chronic insidious low back pain, especially in older patient populations (mean age = 64 years). Lumbar spinal stenosis is a degenerative condition of the spine leading to narrowing in the spaces around the neurovascular bundles and the classic symptom of low back pain that radiates to the buttocks and lower extremities bilaterally. It is typically a progressive waxing and waning process that may deteriorate over years. The pain is typically burning or cramping, which worsens with standing and walking and improves with bending forward or sitting. Magnetic resonance imaging is the recommended diagnostic test because it allows cross-sectional measurement of the spinal canal. Options for nonsurgical management include physical therapy, exercise programs, spinal injections with and without corticosteroids, chiropractic treatment, osteopathic manipulation, acupuncture, and lifestyle modifications; however, few of these treatments have high-quality randomized trials demonstrating effectiveness. Surgery may be considered if nonsurgical management is ineffective.

Lumbar spinal stenosis imaging — MRI system assumptions and protocol features: The results of our systematic review may not apply to all MRI systems, and in general, the studies cited in this guideline utilized mid or high field strength MRI systems with dedicated surface coils. Their findings and the ensuing guidelines may not apply to low field strength systems. The results of our systematic review also assume adequate or state-of-the-art technique, and MRI, and to a lesser extent CT (computed tomography), are user dependent. The MRI studies cited in this guideline, in general, utilized thin (4–5 mm) sections and a combination of T1-, proton density and T2 pulse sequences in both the axial and sagittal planes, and state-of-the-art protocols should utilize thin sections and provide excellent signal-to-noise ratios with high in-plane resolution.

A 54-year-old man presented with progressive asymmetric leg pain and weakness. He had a history of invasive squamous cell carcinoma that was fully treated 2 years earlier. His leg symptoms progressed relentlessly during several months. Imaging studies demonstrated enhancement of the cauda equina and leptomeninges of the lower spinal cord. A 54-year-old man came to the emergency department with a 3-month history of progressive leg cramps, low back pain, left thigh numbness, and bilateral lower extremity weakness. The symptoms started with cramps in the left leg and numbness over the anterior left thigh. Gradually, loss of sensation and pain spread to involve the entire left leg and then the right leg. The pain was described as diffuse and throbbing and did not improve with rest or analgesics. He denied bladder and bowel impairment. His history was significant for squamous cell carcinoma of the left temple treated with Mohs surgery 2 years earlier.

Ptosis and left forehead weakness were present after the surgery because of local facial nerve injury. Owing to deep extension of the tumor, he also received external beam radiation. A full-body positron emission tomographic scan after treatment showed no evidence of residual tumor. He was a former smoker and used alcohol occasionally. There was no history of neurological disorders in his family. On physical examination, a surgical defect was present with atrophy of the left temporalis. Neurological examination revealed sensory loss in the left V2 and V3 distribution, left forehead flattening, and mild left ptosis. He also had reduced hearing on the left. Strength in the upper limbs was normal. There was weakness in both lower extremities. The Medical Research Council Scale grade was 4− to 4 on the right and 3− to 4 on the left. Weakness was diffuse except for prominent impairment in left ankle and toe dorsiflexion. There was diffuse muscle atrophy in his left lower extremity.

Tendon reflexes were absent in the upper and lower extremities. Plantar responses were flexor on the right and equivocal on the left. There was decreased sensation to light touch and pain in the left L4-L5 dermatome and right S1-S2 dermatome. He was able to walk with assistance but was limited by weakness and pain. Peripheral blood cell counts and chemistry findings were within normal limits. Magnetic resonance imaging of the entire neuraxis was obtained on initial presentation. Head MRI revealed atrophy of soft tissue and muscle in the left temporal region and enhancement involving the V3 segment of the trigeminal nerve. There was diffuse enhancement and thickening of nerve roots in the cauda equina as well as increased T2 signal and enhancement along the surface of the spinal cord extending from T3 to conus. Results of cerebrospinal fluid examinations and additional serum studies are presented in Table 1 and Table 2.

The initial CSF examination revealed an elevated protein concentration and pleocytosis. Cytological analysis showed only mature and reactive lymphocytes. Gram staining and culture of the CSF were negative. Nerve conduction studies and electromyography revealed active denervation and evidence of an axonal motor-predominant neuropathy affecting the lower extremities with localization to multiple lumbosacral roots. He was transferred to the rehabilitation service, where he was making progress in physical therapy for gait and strength. About a week later, he developed sudden onset of new right facial droop. Examination revealed evidence of complete right facial neuropathy, and cranial imaging showed no changes compared with the previous study. For the diagnosis of acute facial neuropathy, oral acyclovir was initiated and a third CSF examination was conducted. Despite treatment, the patient's clinical condition continued to worsen.

### A pathway for the diagnosis and treatment of lumbar spinal stenosis [^c76891f6]. The Orthopedic Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Lumbar spinal stenosis is a prevalent condition with varied presentation. Most common in older populations, symptoms typically include back, buttock, and posterior thigh pain. Diagnosis is typically based on physical examination and clinical history, but confirmed on imaging studies. Nonsurgical management includes nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories, physical therapy, and epidural injections. If nonoperative management fails or patient presentation involves worsening symptoms, surgical intervention, most commonly in the form of a laminectomy, may be indicated. Recent literature has demonstrated improved pain and functional outcomes with surgery compared with conservative treatment in the middle to long term.

Discussion of Risk, Benefits, Alternatives and Recovery

The consent process will ideally strike a balance between the risks inherent to the procedure and the expected benefits. Establishment of realistic, beneficial outcomes is necessary for appropriate patient understanding of both diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. At one end of the spectrum of a balanced discussion lies the patient knowing and understanding possible risks associated with the procedure. Critics of this line of thought state that this would merely confuse the patient, as without the proper medical background, patients may not comprehend this information. Therefore, this would lead to clouded judgement and an unbalanced decision process. The other end of this spectrum is reminiscent of the abolition of the patient's right to autonomy; that due to this lack of knowledge by the patient, the provider becomes the sole decision-maker. Risks which would affect the decision-making process of a reasonable patient should be elaborated, including anything that poses potential grave adverse consequences. With these rare occurrences, objective data regarding these risks should also be presented to the patient. Presenting such risks in forms of proportions (eg, 1 in 1000) rather than percentages (eg, 0.1%) may be beneficial to patient understanding. This discussion should also include an explanation of the safeguards against adverse consequences and steps to address concerns that may arise.

As previously discussed, alternatives to the proposed procedure should be addressed in this discussion. This includes the risk of potential harms associated with receiving no treatment for patients' established diagnoses. Alternatives should include the spectrum of possible treatments for their diagnosis, from no intervention to the most invasive option possible. For example, spinal stenosis is a common spine pathology that produces back and leg symptoms. Some treatment options for spinal stenosis include physical therapy, epidural steroid injections, percutaneous image-guided lumbar decompression, spinous process spacers, and open surgical decompression with or without fusion/instrumentation. When discussing the recommended treatment options with patients, it is highly advisable to present the alternative options on a spectrum of risks while discussing the potential benefits and drawbacks of the treatment options. Patients may be referred for consultation to another provider who has expertise in the proposed alternative treatment option.

Indications

When pain from clinically significant LSS and NC fails to be managed with noninterventional methods of pain relief, image-guided ESIs are commonly utilized as a safe and effective method of providing diagnostic and therapeutic benefit, which can last from 1 to 6 months. The institution of ESI in the modern treatment algorithm for LSS should be considered carefully for appropriately selected patients. In addition, while advocating for an ESI as an initial form of potentially therapeutic treatment, it is prudent to set patient expectations, and also be mindful to provide further insight into future minimally invasive treatment options from which the patient may benefit long term, based on their individual diagnostic work-up.,

Indications for ESI include confirmation of diagnosis with an accurate and positive history and physical examination findings, MRI and dynamic (flexion, extension, and oblique) x-ray imaging, and possible electrodiagnostic testing, all consistent with clinically significant LSS and NC. Patients should have demonstrated failure of more conservative forms of management. While traditionally ESIs have been studied and utilized predominantly for their therapeutic benefit, with recent advances in minimally invasive spine procedures, there has also been added utility of ESIs to provide diagnostic value in assessing candidacy for more advanced procedural options.,

Given the robust advancement in minimally invasive spine technology and evidence-based clinical efficacy with these options for treating LSS, repetitive ESIs for patients with clinically significant NC should be reserved for those patients who have a robust clinical response and/or are not candidates for higher level interventions or surgical decompression.

### A review of lumbar spinal stenosis with intermittent neurogenic claudication: disease and diagnosis [^de1e2578]. Pain Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

Lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) is a degenerative spinal condition affecting nearly 50% of patients presenting with lower back pain. The goal of this review is to present and summarize the current data on how LSS presents in various populations, how it is diagnosed, and current therapeutic strategies. Properly understanding the prevalence, presentation, and treatment options for individuals suffering from LSS is critical to providing patients the best possible care.

Results

The occurrence of LSS is associated with advanced age. In elderly patients, LSS can be challenging to identify due to the wide variety of presentation subtleties and common comorbidities such as degenerative disc disease. Recent developments in imaging techniques can be useful in accurately identifying the precise location of the spinal compression. Treatment options can range from conservative to surgical, with the latter being reserved for when patients have neurological compromise or conservative measures have failed. Once warranted, there are several surgical techniques at the physician's disposal to best treat each individual case.

### Guideline update for the performance of fusion procedures for degenerative disease of the lumbar spine. part 10: lumbar fusion for stenosis without spondylolisthesis [^2d8b3fab]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine (2014). Low credibility.

Lumbar stenosis is one of the more common radiographic manifestations of the aging process, leading to narrowing of the spinal canal and foramen. When stenosis is clinically relevant, patients often describe activity-related low-back or lower-extremity pain, known as neurogenic claudication. For those patients who do not improve with conservative care, surgery is considered an appropriate treatment alternative. The primary objective of surgery is to reconstitute the spinal canal. The role of fusion, in the absence of a degenerative deformity, is uncertain. The previous guideline recommended against the inclusion of lumbar fusion in the absence of spinal instability or a likelihood of iatrogenic instability. Since the publication of the original guidelines, numerous studies have demonstrated the role of surgical decompression in this patient population; however, few have investigated the utility of fusion in patients without underlying instability. The majority of studies contain a heterogeneous cohort of subjects, often combining patients with and without spondylolisthesis who received various surgical interventions, limiting fusions to those patients with instability. It is difficult if not impossible, therefore, to formulate valid conclusions regarding the utility of fusion for patients with uncomplicated stenosis. Lower-level evidence exists, however, that does not demonstrate an added benefit of fusion for these patients; therefore, in the absence of deformity or instability, the inclusion of a fusion is not recommended.

Katz et al assessment of history and physical findings — diagnostic study and likelihood ratios: The study included 93 consecutive patients evaluated in a spine center, and imaging was available in 88% of patients with lumbar spinal stenosis and confirmed the diagnosis. Historical findings most strongly associated with lumbar spinal stenosis, with a likelihood ratio greater than two, were greater age (LR 2.5), severe lower extremity pain (LR 2.0), absence of pain when seated (LR 6.6), and improvement of pain with sitting (LR 3.1), and symptoms worse with walking had a negative likelihood ratio of 0.96. Physical findings most strongly associated were wide-based gait (LR 1.43), abnormal Romberg test (LR 4.3), and thigh pain after 30 seconds of lumbar extension (LR 2.5).
