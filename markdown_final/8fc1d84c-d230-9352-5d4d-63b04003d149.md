## Question

Ubeitis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about uveitis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining uveitis and its classification. Then, I should verify epidemiology and burden. Next, I will examine etiologies and diagnostic approach. After that, I need to review treatment principles and evidence, including corticosteroids, conventional immunosuppressants, and biologics. I will then consider special populations and multidisciplinary care. Finally, I should identify evidence gaps and future directions, and close with a concise synthesis that ties these elements together with appropriate citations.

> Let me first confirm the definition and classification so I don't misstate fundamentals. Uveitis is intraocular inflammation of the uveal tract, but inflammation often extends beyond the uvea to retina, vitreous, and other ocular structures, which is why the Standardization of Uveitis Nomenclature (SUN) framework classifies disease by anatomic location as anterior, intermediate, posterior, or panuveitis, and by course as acute, chronic, or recurrent, with onset described as sudden or insidious; this standardized schema underpins modern diagnosis and research comparability [^79ef5a8b] [^8fa8eb80].

> Wait, let me verify the epidemiology and burden claims before I proceed. Population-based estimates suggest an annual incidence around 17–52 per 100,000 and a prevalence roughly 38–714 per 100,000, with uveitis accounting for about 10–15% of blindness in the developed world and up to 25% in some developing regions; importantly, it disproportionately affects working-age adults, magnifying socioeconomic impact and years of potential vision loss [^a72d3a51] [^8315badd].

> I need to check the etiologic spectrum and diagnostic implications. Uveitis is broadly infectious versus noninfectious, with noninfectious cases often autoimmune or autoinflammatory and frequently idiopathic; systemic associations include juvenile idiopathic arthritis, spondyloarthropathies, Behçet's disease, sarcoidosis, and multiple sclerosis, among others, and the relative frequency of infectious versus noninfectious etiologies varies by geography and demographics, shaping the pretest probabilities and testing strategies clinicians should adopt [^a72d3a51] [^043e23f3].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about testing; I should confirm a disciplined diagnostic approach. A Bayesian, phenotype-driven strategy anchored in history, exam, and SUN classification narrows the differential and guides targeted labs rather than broad panels; universal syphilis serology is reasonable, HLA-B27 testing is pertinent in unilateral acute anterior non-granulomatous uveitis, and chest imaging with ACE/IGRA is considered in chronic uveitis to evaluate for sarcoidosis or tuberculosis; in select posterior or intermediate cases, MRI or anterior chamber tap with IL-10 may be indicated, but routine screening without clinical orientation is low yield [^e3eac58d] [^ea50cc65].

> Next, I should review treatment principles and make sure I distinguish activity from damage. The overarching goals are to suppress active inflammation, prevent cumulative structural damage, and preserve visual function while minimizing adverse effects; therapy is tailored to etiology, anatomic location, severity, and chronicity, with a general hierarchy of topical corticosteroids for anterior disease, regional or systemic corticosteroids for intermediate or posterior disease, and steroid-sparing immunomodulatory therapy for chronic or sight-threatening inflammation, ideally using the lowest effective dose and duration with close monitoring [^36dcd39a] [^b4f32f9e].

> Let me consider first-line corticosteroids carefully and verify their limitations. Topical corticosteroids remain first-line for anterior uveitis, but chronic use risks cataract and glaucoma; systemic corticosteroids are effective for posterior segment disease but carry substantial systemic toxicity, so steroid-sparing strategies are essential for maintenance; intravitreal or periocular steroids, including sustained-release implants, can reduce systemic exposure but may cause elevated intraocular pressure and cataract, necessitating individualized risk–benefit assessment and ophthalmic surveillance [^36dcd39a] [^c5b72a71].

> I should double-check the evidence base for conventional immunosuppressants because practice often relies on lower-level data. Methotrexate, azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, and calcineurin inhibitors are widely used as steroid-sparing agents in noninfectious uveitis, supported largely by observational cohorts and expert consensus; while randomized data are limited, these agents are considered standard of care in many guidelines and are often continued for 1–2 years in remission before cautious tapering, with safety monitoring tailored to agent-specific risks [^b4f32f9e] [^b342da82].

> Now, I will examine biologics, and I need to ensure I separate mechanistic plausibility from trial outcomes. Anti-TNF monoclonal antibodies, particularly adalimumab, have the strongest evidence in noninfectious posterior uveitis, with VISUAL I and II demonstrating reduced recurrence and improved visual outcomes versus placebo; in JIA-associated uveitis, the SYCAMORE RCT showed methotrexate plus adalimumab outperformed methotrexate alone, supporting early biologic escalation in sight-threatening disease; etanercept, in contrast, is less effective and may worsen ocular inflammation in some contexts, so it is generally avoided for uveitis [^02f6dae9] [^f4675891].

> But wait, what if the uveitis is infectious or masquerade? I should confirm that etiologic therapy is prioritized in infectious cases. For toxoplasmosis, tuberculosis, syphilis, or viral retinitis, pathogen-directed antimicrobial therapy is essential, with corticosteroids reserved for select scenarios after infection control to limit tissue damage; in CMV retinitis, immune recovery uveitis risk rises with immune reconstitution, so minimizing lesion burden and coordinating HAART timing are key preventive strategies [^36dcd39a] [^b3fb1e51].

> Let me think about special populations, starting with children, because the stakes and evidence differ. Pediatric uveitis is often chronic, anterior, and asymptomatic, with JIA-associated uveitis carrying a 10–14% cumulative incidence and high risks of cataract, band keratopathy, glaucoma, and macular edema; guidelines recommend regular ophthalmic screening for JIA, aggressive early control with topical steroids, and timely escalation to methotrexate and anti-TNF therapy for sight-threatening disease, with tight monitoring intervals and shared outcome measures to guide decisions [^d562b23f] [^364e2f81].

> I should confirm the approach in spondyloarthritis-associated uveitis, since recurrence is common. For recurrent anterior uveitis in axial spondyloarthritis, monoclonal anti-TNF agents are preferred over other biologic classes, and patients should have topical corticosteroids available for prompt self-treatment at symptom onset; coordination with ophthalmology ensures timely escalation if flares persist or complications arise [^3a0ee79d] [^de9faeed].

> For Behçet's disease, I need to ensure I align with high-quality guidance. Sight-threatening ocular Behçet's warrants high-dose systemic corticosteroids combined with a steroid-sparing agent such as azathioprine, cyclosporine, interferon-alpha, or a monoclonal anti-TNF; intravitreal steroids may be used as adjuncts for unilateral exacerbations, and tocilizumab is a reasonable third-line option after anti-TNF or interferon failure, all under close ophthalmology co-management [^7d601430] [^096531d3].

> In multiple sclerosis, I should verify the nuanced drug safety considerations. Intermediate uveitis is more prevalent in MS and shares immunopathogenic features; while many MS and uveitis treatments overlap, anti-TNF agents can precipitate demyelination and are generally avoided in MS, so management should be coordinated between neurology and ophthalmology to balance disease control with neuro-ophthalmic safety [^5c9eac3b] [^650d17df].

> Next, I should review evidence gaps and future directions so I don't overstate certainties. The field suffers from heterogeneity, small trials, and inconsistent outcomes; efforts to standardize nomenclature, define core outcome sets incorporating patient-reported priorities, and expand multinational RCTs are underway; emerging areas include targeted biologics, intravitreal delivery systems, biomarker-guided therapy, and digital decision support, but high-quality comparative effectiveness data remain limited and urgently needed [^a72d3a51] [^8315badd].

> Let me reconsider the overall synthesis to ensure internal consistency. Uveitis is a heterogeneous, sight-threatening intraocular inflammatory syndrome best approached with SUN-based classification, a Bayesian diagnostic algorithm, and a stepwise treatment pyramid that escalates from topical steroids to systemic steroids to steroid-sparing immunomodulators and, in refractory noninfectious cases, anti-TNF biologics, all while addressing etiology, anatomic location, and patient-specific factors; multidisciplinary care is essential in systemic disease associations, and evidence quality varies, necessitating shared decision-making and vigilant monitoring for efficacy and toxicity [^79ef5a8b] [^b4f32f9e].

Uveitis is **intraocular inflammation** of the uvea (iris, ciliary body, choroid) and can involve adjacent structures (retina, vitreous, optic nerve) [^79ef5a8b]. It is classified by **anatomy** (anterior, intermediate, posterior, panuveitis) [^8fa8eb80], **course** (acute, chronic, recurrent), and **etiology** (infectious, noninfectious, autoimmune, idiopathic) [^79ef5a8b]. Diagnosis relies on **slit-lamp exam**, funduscopy, and targeted labs/imaging based on suspected cause [^ea50cc65]. Treatment is **etiology-specific**: topical/systemic corticosteroids for inflammation, antimicrobials for infection, and immunomodulators (methotrexate, azathioprine, anti-TNF agents) for refractory or chronic disease [^b4f32f9e] [^d562b23f]. Uveitis is a major cause of preventable blindness, especially in working-age adults, so **early recognition and management are critical** to prevent vision loss [^a72d3a51] [^8315badd].

---

## Classification and etiology

Uveitis is classified by **anatomic location**, **clinical course**, and **etiology**:

| **Classification** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Anatomic location | - Anterior (iris/ciliary body) <br/> - Intermediate (vitreous/pars plana) <br/> - Posterior (retina/choroid) <br/> - Panuveitis (all layers) [^79ef5a8b] |
| Clinical course | - Acute <br/> - Chronic <br/> - Recurrent [^79ef5a8b] |
| Etiology | - Infectious (e.g. toxoplasmosis, CMV, TB, syphilis) <br/> - Noninfectious (autoimmune, idiopathic) <br/> - Traumatic <br/> - Iatrogenic [^a72d3a51] |

---

## Clinical presentation

Symptoms vary by **location and etiology**:

- **Anterior uveitis**: photophobia, pain, redness, blurred vision, floaters.
- **Intermediate uveitis**: floaters, blurred vision, minimal pain.
- **Posterior uveitis**: painless vision loss, floaters, scotomata.
- **Panuveitis**: combined features, often severe [^notfound].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

Diagnosis is **multimodal**:

- **Slit-lamp examination**: anterior chamber cells/flare, keratic precipitates.
- **Funduscopy**: vitreous haze, retinal lesions, choroidal infiltrates.
- **Imaging**: OCT (macular edema), fluorescein angiography (vasculitis), ultrasound (posterior segment obscured).
- **Laboratory testing**: targeted based on suspected etiology (e.g. HLA-B27, syphilis serology, TB testing, ACE, ANA) [^ea50cc65].

---

## Treatment strategies

Treatment is **individualized** by etiology, severity, and chronicity:

- **Corticosteroids**: topical for anterior; periocular/intravitreal or systemic for posterior/panuveitis [^36dcd39a].
- **Immunomodulatory therapy**: methotrexate, azathioprine, mycophenolate, anti-TNF agents (adalimumab, infliximab) for refractory or chronic disease [^b4f32f9e] [^d562b23f].
- **Infectious uveitis**: pathogen-specific antimicrobials (e.g. ganciclovir for CMV, anti-toxoplasmal therapy) [^36dcd39a].
- **Biologic agents**: adalimumab is FDA-approved for noninfectious intermediate, posterior, and panuveitis [^notfound].

---

## Complications

Untreated or poorly controlled uveitis can cause **vision-threatening complications**, including cataract, glaucoma, macular edema, retinal detachment, and permanent vision loss [^79ef5a8b].

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis depends on **etiology, severity, and treatment timeliness**. Anterior uveitis generally has a better prognosis than posterior or panuveitis, and early, aggressive immunosuppression improves outcomes [^364e2f81].

---

Uveitis is a **complex inflammatory eye disease** requiring prompt, etiology-specific therapy to prevent vision loss. Multidisciplinary care and close monitoring are essential to optimize outcomes [^2fa20d4f].

In this review we consider the current evidence base for treatments in inflammatory eye disease, and in particular uveitis, from a historical perspective. We consider the challenges that have traditionally hindered progress in inflammatory eye disease including small target populations, heterogeneous disease groups, poorly defined phenotypes, diagnostic inconsistency, subjective outcome measures, specific issues around visual acuity as an outcome measure and low commercial interest. Strategies to address these issues are considered de novo and with reference to recent advances outside of ophthalmology and highlight the promise for ocular inflammation. Progress in these specialties has included the development of thriving clinical-trial cultures, public-private partnerships, pathogenetic- and structure-led drug design, efficient drug development pipelines, and biomarker-defined treatment protocols enabling personalization of medicine. Although there are challenges, these are exciting opportunities as we seek to develop safe and effective treatments for patients with inflammatory eye disease.

### Systematic review of clinical practice guidelines for uveitis [^9a7cdf5e]. BMJ Open Ophthalmology (2023). High credibility.

Owing to the relative rarity of many forms of uveitis, a key challenge for the development of high-quality guidelines on the treatment of these conditions is to generate the primary research on which guidelines are built. This requires high-quality randomised controlled trials, which often need to be conducted across several countries in order to meet recruitment targets. Preceding any trials of therapeutics, consensus must be reached on the definition of the condition being treated. The recent SUN criteria are a vital development in this area. Well-defined endpoints for trials are also needed, and standardisation of these would make cross-comparisons of new therapeutics being tested more straightforward. There is clear scope for improvement in the availability of clinical guidelines on uveitis diagnosis and management and well as the number of uveitides which are covered by guidelines. It is also apparent that separate guidelines may be appropriate for different care settings. Many patients may present first to a primary care setting, where the practitioner may have very limited training in recognising and treating eye disease. It is necessary therefore to be aware of the target audience for guidelines.

Some weaknesses remain in the design of this systematic review; the initial literature search was restricted to English language guidelines and this does create an anglocentric bias to the selected guidelines. However, this search method does keep this review in line with others completed to inform the PECI. A further limitation is that he initial search was focused on specific eye-related guidelines, which may have missed some guidelines on uveitis related to systemic inflammatory diseases (eg, the spondyloarthropathies) or infectious diseases (eg, tuberculosis and syphilis), though the search strategy did catch guidelines for uveitis associated with JIA.

Conclusion

The history of uveitis illustrates the continually evolving trajectory of medical knowledge, originating from ancient descriptions of ocular diseases and progressing to the contemporary understanding of immunology, genetics and systemic health. Recognising this historical context is essential for advancing future care, as it underscores the longstanding recognition of the intricate relationship between ocular and systemic well-being.

As our comprehension of the immune system and the complexities of ocular inflammation deepens, the future of uveitis management is poised for significant advancement. Ongoing research efforts continue to refine diagnostic methods and therapeutic strategies, offering promising prospects for improved patient outcomes in the future.

### The management of adult and paediatric uveitis for rheumatologists [^2fa20d4f]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2024). High credibility.

Uveitis encompasses multiple different conditions that are all characterized by intra-ocular inflammation. Uveitis occurs in the context of many different rheumatological conditions and carries a substantial risk to vision. Uveitis can develop both at the early stages of rheumatic diseases, sometimes even preceding other clinical features, and at later stages of disease. Uveitis can also occur as either a direct or an indirect complication of therapies used to treat patients with rheumatic disease. Conversely, patients with uveitis of non-rheumatic aetiology sometimes require immunosuppression, a treatment option that is not readily accessible to ophthalmologists. Thus, collaborative working between rheumatologists and ophthalmologists is critical for optimal management of patients with uveitis. This Review is written with rheumatologists in mind, to assist in the care of patients with uveitis. We collate and summarize the latest evidence and best practice in the diagnosis, management and prognostication of uveitis, including future trends and research priorities.

### Pharmacotherapy for uveitis: current management and emerging therapy [^88cf273f]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

Uveitis, a group of conditions characterized by intraocular inflammation, is a major cause of sight loss in the working population. Most uveitis seen in Western countries is noninfectious and appears to be autoimmune or autoinflammatory in nature, requiring treatment with immunosuppressive and/or anti-inflammatory drugs. In this educational review, we outline the ideal characteristics of drugs for uveitis and review the data to support the use of current and emerging therapies in this context. It is crucial that we continue to develop new therapies for use in uveitis that aim to suppress disease activity, prevent accumulation of damage, and preserve visual function for patients with the minimum possible side effects.

Data extraction

An overall view of the strength of recommendation and quality of evidence given in each selected guideline is reported in table 3. Specific recommendations extracted from each CPG are given in online supplemental table, along with the strength of the recommendation as assessed by the guideline writers, and the type of evidence used to make the recommendation.

Table 3
Strength of recommendation and quality of the evidence of the retrieved CPGs

The three selected guidelines covered various areas of clinical practice and types of uveitis. The 2019 American College of Rheumatology/Arthritis Foundation Guideline for the Screening, Monitoring and Treatment of JIA-Associated Uveitiscovered a specific type of uveitis which is associated with JIA. The document included recommendations for screening, monitoring and treatment of the condition as well as patient education, which were drawn up by an expert panel using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology. General recommendations of note in this guideline centre on tight monitoring of children with uveitis; the authors suggest every 3 months for stable, treated uveitis and monthly for patients tapering treatment. Specific treatment recommendations include using prednisolone acetate 1% over alternative topical preparations, and using topical corticosteroids for short-term control of inflammation. Should systemic therapy be required, then subcutaneous methotrexate is recommended over oral methotrexate in the first instance. The large majority of the recommendations within this guideline are based on either the expert opinion of the panel or on clinical studies. The only randomised controlled trial data available to support a recommendation is on the use of antitumour necrosis factor (TNF) biological therapies, where the use of a monoclonal antibody biologic is advised over etanercept, which works by acting as a decoy receptor.

### The history of uveitis: from antiquity to the present day [^1033d177]. Eye (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Uveitis, a condition characterised by inflammation of the uveal tissues, which include the iris, ciliary body, and choroid, is a complex and multifaceted ailment with a diverse range of aetiologies. Causes can range from infections and autoimmune disorders to being of unknown origin.

It is an important contributor to loss of sight around the world, estimated to account for around 10% of visual impairment in the Western world. Each year, there are an estimated 17–52 new cases per 100,000 people, and prevalence ranges from 38–714 per 100,000 people.

Throughout history, this condition has posed a quandary for diagnosis and treatment, due to its complexity. However, as medical knowledge and practices have evolved over time, so too has our understanding of uveitis and its systemic implications. By delving into the past, we can gain a deeper insight into this puzzling condition and how it has been viewed in different eras of medicine.

### Intermediate uveitis associated with MS: diagnosis, clinical features, pathogenic mechanisms, and recommendations for management [^5c9eac3b]. Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Uveitis is a major cause of visual impairment and blindness among working-age adults, accounting for 10% of legal blindness in the United States. Among people with MS, the prevalence of uveitis is 10 times higher than among the general population, and because MS and uveitis share similar genetic risk factors and immunologic effector pathways, it is not clear whether uveitis is one of the manifestations of MS or a coincident disorder. This uncertainty raises several diagnostic and management issues for clinicians who look after these patients, particularly with regard to recognizing visual symptoms resulting from demyelination, intraocular inflammation, or the visual complications of disease modifying drugs for MS, e.g., fingolimod. Likewise, management decisions regarding patients with uveitis are influenced by the risk of precipitating or exacerbating episodes of demyelination, e.g., following anti-tumor necrosis factor biologic therapy, and other neurologic complications of immunosuppressive treatments for uveitis. In this review, we explore the similarities in the pathophysiology, clinical features, and treatment of patients with uveitis and MS. Based on the latest evidence, we make a set of recommendations to help guide neurologists and ophthalmologists to best manage patients affected by both conditions.

### Systematic review of clinical practice guidelines for uveitis [^a4bd8ea0]. BMJ Open Ophthalmology (2023). High credibility.

Conclusion

Uveitis is an important clinical problem, with high prevalence worldwide, and with high visual morbidity. It is an umbrella term for a range of clinical entities, and the range of different aetiologies for uveitis, including infectious, autoimmune and autoinflammatory, traumatic and ischaemic causes, means that single overarching guidelines are difficult to produce. Guidance exists on the use of newer treatments such as the monoclonal antibody anti-TNF treatment adalimumab and slow release dexamethasone intravitreal implants in non-infectious posterior uveitis, but this covers only a small proportion of cases of uveitis, and anti-TNF treatment is only recommended for cases refractory to first line (corticosteroid) and second line (conventional immunosuppressive) therapies. However, no guidance exists on when to initiate these first- and second-line treatments. There is also a marked lack of guidance on the more common presentation of anterior uveitis; and on infectious uveitis, which can be devastating to vision.

Designing specific guidelines for each subtype of uveitis is likely impractical, as is a single CPG to cover all uveitis. However, an achievable way of increasing coverage of uveitis by CPGs, to the benefit of patients worldwide, may be to aim for guidance on uveitides based on aetiology and/or anatomical location. Broad guidelines could cover diagnosis, treatment strategies and monitoring of several uveitis subtypes under this arrangement.

Regrettably, evidence derived from CPGs for uveitis to support the development of the WHO PECI form a small pool, and cover only a minority of the clinical presentations of uveitis in sufficient detail to help clinical decision making. Thus, there will be a greater reliance on Cochrane Systematic Reviews and expert opinion in deciding on interventions to include in the PECI. There is an urgent requirement for high-quality, evidence-based guidance on a wider range of uveitides. The COVID-19 pandemic has precipitated a necessary collaboration between clinicians around the world, including uveitis specialists, due to the need for shared experience during a period of uncertainty. This era of collaboration may accelerate larger and higher-quality studies and reviews, which would support measures such as the PECI in the future.

Comparative safety, efficacy, and tolerability of the drugs available for uveitis treatment

When considering the drugs currently available for use in the treatment of ocular inflammation, it is important to recognize the limitations in the evidence that supports their role in uveitis. For many agents there are no randomized controlled trials in uveitis and, thus, justification of their use is based on open-label cohort studies, uncontrolled case-series, extrapolation from their use in other inflammatory conditions, and expert opinion. As a result, it is not yet possible to provide a definitive account of which treatment is "best" for any particular variant of uveitis. Similarly, given the acknowledged limitations in the evidence base, there is no clear line between those drugs that are "established" and those that are still "in development". For the purposes of this review, we have included within the "established" group those agents that are commonly used by specialists in uveitis services (this includes many second-line agents and the older anti-tumor necrosis factor [TNF] agents). Within the "in development" group, we consider both those agents that are in early phase of development and those agents that have established efficacy in other diseases, but have as yet limited evidence for their role in uveitis.

Please refer to Table 1 for a summary of the therapeutic agents discussed in this review. Further guidance for the monitoring of these agents may be found from a number of external resources;, however, it should be noted that guidance varies between institutions and, thus, all such advice should be checked against local protocols.

### Systematic review of clinical practice guidelines for uveitis [^02f6dae9]. BMJ Open Ophthalmology (2023). High credibility.

The diverse spectrum of disease under the umbrella of uveitis means that a single, or even a handful, of guidelines cannot comprehensively cover all disease subtypes. Although the most recent SUN working group continue to systematise the approach to disease diagnosis, classification and outcomes, there remain significant gaps in terms of guidelines for investigation and treatment of uveitis, particularly in adult patients. Paediatric uveitis is commonly associated with JIA and this spectrum of disease is well covered by one guideline. Cases of paediatric uveitis occurring without a background of JIA are, however, not covered.

Owing to the relative paucity of guidelines for uveitis, there can be little cross-checking between guidelines from different sources to assess concordance in recommendations. However, one consistent theme of two of the three included guidelines is that treatment with biologic anti- TNF agents (eg, adalimumab) is appropriate in cases with a high risk of 'blindness'or 'sight-threatening complications'. This guidance is largely based on expert opinion, though there are randomised controlled trials comparing Adalimumab to placebo in adult patients (VISUAL I and VISUAL II trials), which showed beneficial results. These trials did not, however, compare adalimumab to any conventional immunosuppressive therapy. The SYCAMORE trialdid provide this comparison for paediatric uveitis associated with JIA, demonstrating a significantly lower treatment failure rate in the methotrexate plus adalimumab group compared with the methotrexate plus placebo group. This is reflected in the JIA-associated uveitis guideline chosen for inclusion here, which recommends starting methotrexate and a monoclonal antibody TNF inhibitor immediately over methotrexate as monotherapy for severe active uveitis with sight threatening complications.

### Consensus-based recommendations for the management of uveitis associated with juvenile idiopathic arthritis: the SHARE initiative [^b4642011]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2018). Medium credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for juvenile idiopathic arthritis-associated uveitis, more specifically with respect to indications for screening, SHARE initiative 2018 guidelines recommend to obtain screening for uveitis by an ophthalmologist at least every 3 months for at least 1 year in patients with JIA stopping systemic immunosuppression, as they are at risk of developing new-onset uveitis or recurrence of uveitis after prolonged remission.

### Monitoring of juvenile idiopathic arthritis-associated uveitis in long-term disease remission: consensus-based recommendations from the multinational interdisciplinary working group for uveitis in childhood [^0cd7c34f]. Arthritis Care & Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

We aimed to develop consensus-based recommendations for the monitoring of children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis-associated uveitis (JIAU) in long-term remission, addressing the absence of international guidance on monitoring schedules for these children and young people.

Methods

The Multinational Interdisciplinary Working Group for Uveitis in Childhood convened experts from 10 countries, including pediatric rheumatologists and ophthalmologists, alongside parents of affected children. A review of key longitudinal cohort studies informed a structured consensus process comprising discussion, recommendation development, and voting for adoption, with a consensus threshold of ≥ 80% needed for adoption. Recommendation development focused on three principal questions: stratification of the risk of poor outcomes, the natural history of JIAU postremission, and the impact of delayed examination.

Results

The group established several key recommendations, including a standard monitoring frequency of every 4 months for the first four years following medication cessation, ongoing assessments for patients with structural complications, and low-frequency monitoring every 6 months for those in stable, drug-free remission for over four years. There was unanimous agreement on these recommendations.

Conclusion

These consensus-based recommendations provide a framework for monitoring children with JIAU in remission, enhancing the quality of care and optimizing resource use in eye health services. Ongoing research is essential to refine these guidelines as new evidence emerges regarding biomarkers and imaging techniques for disease recurrence.

### Standardization of uveitis nomenclature for reporting clinical data. results of the first international workshop [^8fa8eb80]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose

To begin a process of standardizing the methods for reporting clinical data in the field of uveitis.

Design

Consensus workshop.

Methods

Members of an international working group were surveyed about diagnostic terminology, inflammation grading schema, and outcome measures, and the results used to develop a series of proposals to better standardize the use of these entities. Small groups employed nominal group techniques to achieve consensus on several of these issues.

Results

The group affirmed that an anatomic classification of uveitis should be used as a framework for subsequent work on diagnostic criteria for specific uveitic syndromes, and that the classification of uveitis entities should be on the basis of the location of the inflammation and not on the presence of structural complications. Issues regarding the use of the terms "intermediate uveitis", "pars planitis", "panuveitis", and descriptors of the onset and course of the uveitis were addressed. The following were adopted: standardized grading schema for anterior chamber cells, anterior chamber flare, and for vitreous haze; standardized methods of recording structural complications of uveitis; standardized definitions of outcomes, including "inactive" inflammation, "improvement'; and "worsening" of the inflammation, and "corticosteroid sparing", and standardized guidelines for reporting visual acuity outcomes.

Conclusions

A process of standardizing the approach to reporting clinical data in uveitis research has begun, and several terms have been standardized.

### Uveitis for neurologists [^9a281813]. Practical Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

This review offers comprehensive insights into the presenting features, terminology, imaging techniques and management strategies associated with uveitis, specifically designed to help neurologists understand this complex condition. We have created a glossary of terms used in uveitis care and ocular imaging to help clarify terminology. We have ordered uveitis subtypes in an intuitive manner, focusing on those that neurologists are more likely to encounter. We have written the article from the perspective of uveitis specialists practising in the UK, while emphasising the global variability in clinical presentations and causes. By offering practical guidance on recognising uveitis features as well as treatment options, we aim for this to be a neurologists' aide mémoire to help manage intraocular inflammation.

### Systematic review of clinical practice guidelines for uveitis [^a72d3a51]. BMJ Open Ophthalmology (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

A key recommendation of the WHO's 2019 World report on visionwas to embed eye care within universal health coverage (UHC) in order to address inequities in access to eye care services and contribute to Sustainable Development Goals. To enable countries to plan, budget and integrate eye care into UHC, WHO is developing a priority package of eye care interventions (PECI), in collaboration with Cochrane Eyes and Vision (CEV). A crucial step in the development of the PECI is the systematic identification of evidence-based eye care interventions for selected priority eye conditions using high-quality clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) and, where needed, systematic reviews. Uveitis has been identified as 1 of 15 priority eye conditions for inclusion in the PECI.

Uveitis is a common, sight-threatening group of disorders, all of which are characterised by inflammation of the uveal tract of the eye (iris, ciliary body and choroid). Population-based studies have suggested an overall incidence of 17–52 people in 100 000 each year, and that uveitis causes 9%–15% of blindness in the Western World. Classifying this heterogeneous disease spectrum, which spans numerous infectious and autoimmune diseases, has been a unique challenge for ophthalmic clinicians. The standardisation of uveitis nomenclature (SUN) group sought to standardise the descriptions of the diseases and syndromes, mapping at least 28 uveitis diseases in 2005. This variability in disease features, both across and within distinct disease groups, has impacted clinical trials in uveitis.

Nevertheless, interventions for uveitis are continually emerging. These have included medications applied to the eye such as topical steroidand non-steroidal eye-drops, local injection treatments to the eye and intraocular steroid implants, systemic immunosuppressantsand immunomodulatory therapies which include newer biologic treatments. The purpose of this paper is to present the results, including the quality and current state of evidence, of a systematic review of CPGs for uveitis.

### Pharmacotherapy for uveitis: current management and emerging therapy [^25e2a328]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusion

The increasing choices of immunosuppressives/immunomodulatory therapy and the advent of more targeted therapies are both an opportunity and a challenge. The clinicians should always consider the patient first and foremost. It is vital that one establishes the efficacy and safety profile of both established and emerging therapies so that treatment decisions can be informed and appropriate to the individual. In addition, it is likely that stricter regulatory frameworks and tighter budgetary constraints may make it even more difficult to navigate the latest hurdles in the drug-development pathway of licensing and funding approval. With such considerations in mind, we need to recognize that to some extent the whole uveitis pharmacopoeia is "in development".

### A comprehensive review and update on the biologic treatment of adult noninfectious uveitis: part II [^69e7ef29]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Treatment of adult, noninfectious uveitis remains a major challenge for ophthalmologists around the world, especially in regard to recalcitrant cases. It is reported to comprise approximately 10% of preventable blindness in the USA. The cause of uveitis can be idiopathic or associated with infectious and systemic disorders. The era of biologic medical therapies provides new options for patients with otherwise treatment-resistant inflammatory eye disease.

Areas Covered

This two-part review gives a comprehensive overview of the existing medical treatment options for patients with adult, noninfectious uveitis, as well as important advances for the treatment ocular inflammation. Part I covers classic immunomodulation and latest information on corticosteroid therapy. In part II, emerging therapies are discussed, including biologic response modifiers, experimental treatments and ongoing clinical studies for uveitis.

Expert Opinion

The hazard of chronic corticosteroid use in the treatment of adult, noninfectious uveitis is well documented. Corticosteroid-sparing therapies, which offer a very favorable risk-benefit profile when administered properly, should be substituted. Although nothing is currently approved for on-label use in this indication, many therapies, through either translation or novel basic science research, have the potential to fill the currently exposed gaps.

### Noninfectious uveitis: strategies to optimize treatment compliance and adherence [^b55dcd83]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Noninfectious uveitis includes a heterogenous group of sight-threatening ocular and systemic disorders. Significant progress has been made in the treatment of noninfectious uveitis in recent years, particularly with regard to the effective use of corticosteroids and non-corticosteroid immunosuppressive drugs, including biologic agents. All of these therapeutic approaches are limited, however, by any given patient's ability to comply with and adhere to their prescribed treatment. In fact, compliance and adherence are among the most important patient-related determinants of treatment success. We discuss strategies to optimize compliance and adherence.

### Immunopharmacotherapy of non-infectious uveitis: where do we stand? [^5c5c07df]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2014). Low credibility.

With ever-evolving concept of personalised medicine backed up with specific biomarkers for ocular inflammatory disease, there is a sudden surge of using biologics in non-infectious recalcitrant posterior uveitis. Have we understood these biologic agents enough to embark on this long enduring journey with the patient to optimise control of intraocular inflammation? On the other hand, there is still a strong inhibition of using these novel agents in management of uveitis even at tertiary referral centres. Immunopharmacotherapy of non-infectious uveitis poses a significant conundrum for both physicians and patients as it is like a two-edged sword effective to control inflammation but at the same time potentially toxic, suspected of causing long-term adverse effects. Systemic immunosuppressive therapy is used in a substantial number of most vision-threatening ocular inflammatory diseases. There is lack of randomised control trials establishing the safety of this therapy and our current practice pattern is based on retrospective studies and personal experience in using this treatment modality. This overview will highlight on the current dilemma faced by the clinicians in opting for steroid-sparing immunosuppressive therapy.

### 2019 American College of Rheumatology / arthritis foundation guideline for the screening, monitoring, and treatment of juvenile idiopathic arthritis-associated uveitis [^d562b23f]. Arthritis Care & Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

To develop recommendations for the screening, monitoring, and treatment of uveitis in children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA).

Methods

Pediatric rheumatologists, ophthalmologists with expertise in uveitis, patient representatives, and methodologists generated key clinical questions to be addressed by this guideline. This was followed by a systematic literature review and rating of the available evidence according to the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) methodology. A group consensus process was used to compose the final recommendations and grade their strength as conditional or strong.

Results

Due to a lack of literature with good quality of evidence, recommendations were formulated on the basis of available evidence and a consensus expert opinion. Regular ophthalmic screening of children with JIA is recommended because of the risk of uveitis, and the frequency of screening should be based on individual risk factors. Regular ophthalmic monitoring of children with uveitis is recommended, and intervals should be based on ocular examination findings and treatment regimen. Ophthalmic monitoring recommendations were strong primarily because of concerns of vision-threatening complications of uveitis with infrequent monitoring. Topical glucocorticoids should be used as initial treatment to achieve control of inflammation. Methotrexate and the monoclonal antibody tumor necrosis factor inhibitors adalimumab and infliximab are recommended when systemic treatment is needed for the management of uveitis. The timely addition of nonbiologic and biologic drugs is recommended to maintain uveitis control in children who are at continued risk of vision loss.

Conclusion

This guideline provides direction for clinicians and patients/parents making decisions on the screening, monitoring, and management of children with JIA and uveitis, using GRADE methodology and informed by a consensus process with input from rheumatology and ophthalmology experts, current literature, and patient/parent preferences and values.

### Guidance on noncorticosteroid systemic immunomodulatory therapy in noninfectious uveitis: fundamentals of care for uveitiS (FOCUS) initiative [^b4f32f9e]. Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

Topic

An international, expert-led consensus initiative to develop systematic, evidence-based recommendations for the treatment of noninfectious uveitis in the era of biologics.

Clinical Relevance

The availability of biologic agents for the treatment of human eye disease has altered practice patterns for the management of noninfectious uveitis. Current guidelines are insufficient to assure optimal use of noncorticosteroid systemic immunomodulatory agents.

Methods

An international expert steering committee comprising 9 uveitis specialists (including both ophthalmologists and rheumatologists) identified clinical questions and, together with 6 bibliographic fellows trained in uveitis, conducted a Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses protocol systematic review of the literature (English language studies from January 1996 through June 2016; Medline [OVID], the Central Cochrane library, EMBASE, CINAHL, SCOPUS, BIOSIS, and Web of Science). Publications included randomized controlled trials, prospective and retrospective studies with sufficient follow-up, case series with 15 cases or more, peer-reviewed articles, and hand-searched conference abstracts from key conferences. The proposed statements were circulated among 130 international uveitis experts for review. A total of 44 globally representative group members met in late 2016 to refine these guidelines using a modified Delphi technique and assigned Oxford levels of evidence.

Results

In total, 10 questions were addressed resulting in 21 evidence-based guidance statements covering the following topics: when to start noncorticosteroid immunomodulatory therapy, including both biologic and nonbiologic agents; what data to collect before treatment; when to modify or withdraw treatment; how to select agents based on individual efficacy and safety profiles; and evidence in specific uveitic conditions. Shared decision-making, communication among providers and safety monitoring also were addressed as part of the recommendations. Pharmacoeconomic considerations were not addressed.

Conclusions

Consensus guidelines were developed based on published literature, expert opinion, and practical experience to bridge the gap between clinical needs and medical evidence to support the treatment of patients with noninfectious uveitis with noncorticosteroid immunomodulatory agents.

### Approach to the diagnosis of the uveitides [^e3eac58d]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

To describe an approach to diagnosing the uveitides, a collection of about 30 separate diseases characterized by intraocular inflammation.

Design

Perspective.

Methods

Integration of clinical approach with a more formal, informatics-derived approach to characterization and a Bayesian approach to laboratory testing.

Results

The patient's uveitis is characterized along several dimensions: course, laterality, anatomic location of the inflammation, morphology, presence of active infection, and the host (age, presence of a systemic disease). Posterior uveitis can be characterized further by whether it is primarily a retinitis, choroiditis, or retinal vasculitis; by whether it is paucifocal or multifocal; and by the morphology of the lesions. This characterization narrows the differential diagnosis to 1 or, at most, a few diseases. Laboratory screening (ie, testing all patients) should be reserved for those diseases that can present as any type of uveitis, whereas targeted testing (ie, testing a subset with specific features) is used selectively. Laboratory testing should be used to identify an infection (which will alter therapy) or a systemic disease that will affect the patient's health. A uveitis that is not one of the established diagnoses is designated as "undifferentiated" with the course, laterality, and anatomic location (eg, undifferentiated bilateral chronic anterior uveitis). We avoid the term "idiopathic" uveitis as most identified noninfectious uveitic diseases are idiopathic, and most systemic diseases associated with uveitis also are idiopathic (eg, juvenile idiopathic arthritis).

Conclusion

This approach should lead to the correct diagnosis of the specific uveitic disease in the large majority of cases without overuse of laboratory testing.

### Systematic review of clinical practice guidelines for uveitis [^3c67d308]. BMJ Open Ophthalmology (2023). High credibility.

Discussion

The CPGs available to help inform the WHO PECI for uveitis formed a relatively small pool. Of 496 CPGs identified by literature search, and 56 passing title and abstract screening, the large majority were not relevant to uveitis on full-text screening. Of those identified to be of relevance to uveitis, only three guidelines were of sufficient quality (based on key AGREE II item scores) to merit inclusion. This highlights an important and concerning deficiency in high-quality CPGs in the field of uveitis and may reflect the heterogeneity of the uveitis disease spectrum and the fact that most individual uveitides are relatively uncommon. Some guidelineswere excluded at the screening stage owing to possible conflicts of interest as they were funded by industry partners. Industry funding of research is a common and necessary practice, but, given the intended large reach of the PECI particularly among developing nations, it was crucial to avoid any actual or potential commercial bias towards particular interventions. At the point of AGREE II scoring, the most common item for a guideline to fall short on was item 8 — 'The criteria for selecting the evidence are clearly described'. Four guidelines had an average score of less than three on this point, which excluded them from inclusion (table 2). This highlights the importance of clarity on how clinical guidelines select the evidence which informs their guidance.

### Systematic review of clinical practice guidelines for uveitis [^e10d1ee5]. BMJ Open Ophthalmology (2023). High credibility.

To facilitate the integration of eye care into universal health coverage, the WHO is developing a Package of Eye Care Interventions (PECI). Development of the PECI involves the identification of evidence-based interventions from relevant clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) for uveitis. A systematic review of CPGs published on uveitis between 2010 and March 2020 was conducted. CPGs passing title and abstract and full-text screening were evaluated using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II (AGREE II) tool and data on recommended interventions extracted using a standard data extraction sheet. Of 56 CPGs identified as potentially relevant from the systematic literature search, 3 CPGs underwent data extraction following the screening stages and appraisal with the AGREE II tool. These CPGs covered screening for, monitoring and treating juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA)-associated uveitis, the use of adalimumab and dexamethasone in treating non-infectious uveitis, and a top-level summary of assessment, differential diagnosis and referral recommendations for uveitis, aimed at primary care practitioners. Many of the recommendations were based on expert opinion, though some incorporated clinical study and randomised controlled trial data. There is currently sparse coverage of the spectrum of disease caused by uveitis within CPGs. This may partially be due to the large number of conditions with diverse causes and clinical presentations covered by the umbrella term uveitis, which makes numerous sets of guidelines necessary. The limited pool of CPGs to select from has implications for clinicians seeking guidance on clinical care strategies for uveitis.

### Intermediate uveitis associated with MS: diagnosis, clinical features, pathogenic mechanisms, and recommendations for management [^10966b21]. Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Uveitis is a major cause of visual impairment and blindness among working-age adults, accounting for 10% of legal blindness in the United States. Uveitis is traditionally defined as inflammation of the uveal tract, although inflammation is not confined to the uvea; consequently, uveitis is now defined anatomically based on the principal sites of inflammation: anterior uveitis affects the iris and ciliary body; intermediate uveitis (IU) predominantly affects the vitreous; posterior uveitis affects the retina and/or choroid; and panuveitis refers to anterior, intermediate, and posterior uveitis combined. The incidence of uveitis varies between 17.4 and 52.4 cases per 100,000 person years, and the prevalence between 69.0 to 114.5 per 100,000 persons, but among patients with MS, the prevalence is 1%.

MS is an inflammatory demyelinating disease of the CNS, affecting almost 2.5 million people worldwide. It is frequently associated with visual symptoms caused by demyelinating lesions of afferent and efferent visual pathways. IU is the uveitis subtype most commonly associated with MS, but because retinal neurons are normally unmyelinated, IU is not a consequence of demyelination. Yet it is still not known whether IU is one of the manifestations of MS or a coincident disorder. This raises several diagnostic and management issues for clinicians who look after patients affected by both disorders with regard to recognizing visual symptoms resulting from demyelination, intraocular inflammation, or the complications of treatment.

This review summarizes the common pathophysiology and clinical features of IU and MS to draw inferences regarding the optimal management of patients affected by both conditions.

### New and updated recommendations for the treatment of juvenile idiopathic arthritis-associated uveitis and idiopathic chronic anterior uveitis [^9a6e11db]. Arthritis Care & Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

The Multinational Interdisciplinary Working Group for Uveitis in Childhood identified the need to update the current guidelines, and the objective here was to produce this document to guide clinicians managing children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis-associated uveitis (JIAU) and idiopathic chronic anterior uveitis (CAU).

Methods

The group analyzed the literature published between December 2014 and June 2020 after a systematic literature review conducted by 2 clinicians. Pediatric rheumatologists were paired with ophthalmologists to review the eligible 37 publications. The search criteria were selected to reflect those used for the 2018 Single Hub and Access point for pediatric Rheumatology in Europe (SHARE) recommendations, in order to provide an update, rather than a replacement for that publication. The summary of the current evidence for each SHARE recommendation was presented to the expert committee. These recommendations were then discussed and revised during a video consensus meeting on January 22, 2021, with 14 voting participants, using a nominal group technique to reach consensus.

Results

JIAU treatment was extended to include CAU. Fourteen recommendations regarding treatment of JIAU und CAU with > 90% agreement were accepted.

Conclusion

An update to the previous 2018 SHARE recommendations for the treatment of children with JIAU with the addition of CAU was created using an evidence-based consensus process. This guideline should help support clinicians to care for children and young people with CAU.

Shared treatment approaches in the management of MS and IU

Available treatments for MS and IU aim to reduce symptoms and cumulative visual or neurologic disability, but the complications of treatment can also affect visual and neurologic function (tables 1 and 2). The unintended consequences of treatment need careful differentiation from disease relapses or progression because their management will differ. The multidisciplinary management of patients by a neurologist and ophthalmologist is recommended for the best outcomes.

Modern advances in uveitis and the era of collaboration

The late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries subsequently witnessed an explosion of knowledge regarding the genetic and molecular underpinnings of uveitis. But it was the revolutions in imaging technology which slowly took over as driver for discovery. Technological advances, including optical coherence tomography, fluorescein angiography, and anterior segment optical coherence tomography, revolutionised the ability to visualise intraocular inflammation in unprecedented detail, allowing for earlier detection and more precise management of uveitis.

The recognition of early intervention as a critical factor in preventing vision loss and improving long-term outcomes in uveitis has gained increasing prominence, supported by numerous studies. Nevertheless, significant challenges persisted in the diagnosis and management of uveitis, prompting the establishment of collaborative organisations. The International Uveitis Study Group, founded in 1978, and the International Ocular Inflammation Society, established in 1989, played pivotal roles in advancing evidence-based approaches and fostering consensus among clinicians. These efforts culminated in the Standardization of Uveitis Nomenclature (SUN) initiative, which has been working towards international consensus on the classification criteria for uveitis [SUN] since 2004.

Steady further understanding of the immunopathology in Uveitis has allowed for the development of more bespoke therapies, targeting specific cytokines or cell surface receptors for more precise immunosuppression. Biologic therapies, such as tumour necrosis factor inhibitors and interleukin inhibitors, have provided new treatment avenues, particularly for patients with refractory non-infectious uveitis. Muromonab was the first of its kind, developed in the mid-1980s for treating glucocorticoid-resistant rejection. In the late 1990s, drugs like etanercept were created to target specific autoimmune disorders like rheumatoid arthritis. Other biologics, including abatacept, adalimumab, daclizumab, infliximab, anakinra, rituximab and tocilizumab soon followed. Treatment modalities such as intravenous immunoglobulin and interferon-γ also emerged. These therapies, alongside refined surgical techniques, have improved outcomes and reduced complications for patients with uveitis.

The future of uveitis treatment will involve a combination of advanced biologics, gene therapies, precision medicine and AI-driven tools, all of which will enhance both preventative and therapeutic approaches. The ongoing emphasis on early detection and multidisciplinary collaboration will be key to improving patient outcomes and reducing the burden of this potentially sight-threatening disease.

### Biological agents for the treatment of uveitis [^1c4b21ad]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

The conventional treatment of uveitis includes corticosteroids and immunosuppressive agents, which are highly efficacious, but can be associated with serious systemic side effects. Over the last two decades, advances in the understanding of the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases, as well as improved biotechnology, have enabled selective targeting of the chemical mediators of diseases. Recently, a new class of drugs called biologics, that target the various mediators of the inflammation cascade, may potentially provide more effective and less toxic treatment.

Areas Covered

This article is a review and summary of the peer-reviewed evidence for biologic agents in the treatment of various forms of ocular inflammation and it focuses on the potential use of other biologic agents that have been tested in experimental autoimmune uveitis. Pubmed was used as our main tool for our literature search. Some additional references were taken from books written on the subject.

Expert Opinion

There are a wide variety of new and emerging biological agents currently being used in the treatment of uveitis which has expanded the therapeutic horizons far beyond previous limitations.

### An update on the modern management of paediatric uveitis [^364e2f81]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2019). Medium credibility.

Uveitis in children and young people (CYP) is often painless, chronic and persistent. It is an often silent blinding condition. Uveitis can be isolated or develop as a manifestation of a systemic disease. Due to the symptomless nature, it can present late with advanced ocular comorbidities such as band keratopathy, hypotony, cataracts. Inadequate control of the eye inflammation can result in permanent and severe ocular complications, structural damage and visual loss. One of the most common systemic associations is juvenile idiopathic arthritis where uveitis has a cumulative incidence of approximately 10%-14% (though wide variation in incidence is reported) after 5 years. Appropriately targeted uveitis screening is recommended to continue for at least 7 years in some subgroups. Paediatric uveitis poses multiple diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. Clinical manifestation and disease course may differ significantly from adult-onset uveitis. However, some CYP are still managed by adult specialists alone, without the opportunity for the prompt use of National Health Service England approved therapy. Optimal management of paediatric uveitis requires a multidisciplinary approach involving coordinated working of different specialities and healthcare professionals. This article highlights the evidence-based practice for the contemporary management of paediatric uveitis to readers in different specialities who may come across this condition. It raises awareness of early systemic treatment aiming to achieve early and complete disease inactivity thereby improving the chances of a long-term positive outcome.

### Immunotherapeutic strategies in autoimmune uveitis [^fe0dbfd8]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

The heterogeneity of underlying factors and the variable disease severity of AIU patients reinforce the need for an accurate diagnosis. Although currently available therapies are effective in the treatment of a wide spectrum of uveitis, most are associated with important and severe side effects. In this sense, treatments based on novel molecules or employing well-known molecules, tuning their use to the various hierarchical levels of the immune response, represent promising avenues of research. Moreover, the investigation of alternative or combined treatments focusing on groups of patients with a similar disorder may be also fruitful.

Here, we review ongoing research to treat AIU with promising immunomodulatory therapeutic strategies, highlighting their specific features, interactions and the responses triggered by the targeted immune molecules that aim to minimize clinical complications and the likelihood of disease relapse. For improved comprehension we first review the main features of AIU, diagnostic tools and traditional forms of therapy, as well the animal models predominantly used to understand its pathogenesis and test novel intervention approaches.

### Pharmacotherapy for uveitis: current management and emerging therapy [^36dcd39a]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

Brief overview of treatment strategies

For infectious causes, treatment is aimed at eradicating the pathogenic organism with appropriately targeted antimicrobial therapy. In severe cases, such agents may be delivered directly to the eye by intravitreal injection, or are more frequently administered systemically by an oral or intravenous route. Once the infectious agent is considered to be under control, immunosuppressive agents such as corticosteroids may be used judiciously to limit tissue damage.

For noninfectious causes, treatment involves suppression of the local immune response. It is useful to consider the concept of disease activity versus damage when treating inflammatory disease."Activity" refers to the ongoing immune response, which may be acute or chronic, but is usually reversible. "Damage" refers to the effect of active inflammation on native tissues; it is usually irreversible. In simple terms, persistent activity will lead to accumulation of damage. In theory, effective therapy should suppress all activity and prevent or halt accumulation of damage.

Therapy in noninfectious uveitis is aimed at suppressing the immune system, and ranges from topical therapy (commonly corticosteroid eye drops) to systemic immunosuppression with either high-dose corticosteroids (oral, intravenous, intramuscular, or subcutaneous) or a wide range of corticosteroid-sparing immunomodulatory therapeutic (IMT) agents. Ideally, treatment should be targeted to the mechanism and localized to the tissue to maximize the efficacy/side-effect profile. However, this is often not achieved and new therapies should therefore aim to suppress disease activity, prevent accumulation of damage, and preserve visual function for patients with the minimum number of possible adverse events.–

### Retisert: is the new advance in treatment of uveitis a good one? [^c5b72a71]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the use of corticosteroids for the treatment of uveitis, with a focus on the pharmacology, efficacy, and safety of a newer delivery device, Retisert.

Data Sources

A PubMed/MEDLINE search from 1950 through February 2007 was conducted, and manufacturer-provided data were reviewed.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Animal studies and Phase II and III clinical trials evaluating the safety and efficacy of Retisert for the treatment of uveitis were considered. The data were extracted from PubMed/MEDLINE using the search terms fluocinolone acetonide, corticosteroids, intravitreal implant, uveitis, ocular steroids, and Retisert.

Data Synthesis

The findings of the clinical studies showed, with use of Retisert, a reduction in the recurrence of uveitis, improvement in visual acuity, and a decreased need for adjunctive therapy with corticosteroids and immunosuppressant agents. There are currently no studies directly comparing Retisert with other treatment options. The most commonly reported adverse events (ADEs) in clinical trials included cataracts, increased intraocular pressure, post-procedural complications associated with implant insertion, and ocular pain. Other ocular ADEs included decreased visual acuity, glaucoma, blurred vision, an abnormal sensation in the eye, eye irritation, and a change in tearing. These ADEs are similar to those seen with chronic corticosteroid therapy delivered by other ocular routes.

Conclusions

Retisert implants have been shown to deliver sufficient drug for a longer period of time compared with the traditional steroid delivery methods. Promising efficacy results show a significant reduction in recurrence rate and improvement in visual acuity for approximately 3 years after implant. However, the drug carries the risks associated with the implant procedure and with chronic exposure of the eye to steroids. Until more data on the long-term safety are known, Retisert should be reserved for patients who are no longer tolerant of or responsive to more traditional treatment modalities.

### Consensus-based recommendations for the management of uveitis associated with juvenile idiopathic arthritis: the SHARE initiative [^5aa9d73a]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2018). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for juvenile idiopathic arthritis-associated uveitis, more specifically with respect to DMARDs, biological DMARDs, SHARE initiative 2018 guidelines recommend to add or switch to biological treatment in case of methotrexate inefficacy or intolerance. Initiate anti-TNF agents (adalimumab > infliximab > golimumab) in patients with uveitis refractory/resistant to DMARD therapy, principally methotrexate. Consider switching between different anti-TNF treatments if uveitis is refractory to the first anti-TNF.

### Uveitis: diagnostic work-up. A literature review and recommendations from an expert committee [^ea50cc65]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

Diagnosis of uveitis is difficult. Etiologic investigations should take into account the epidemiology of uveitis and should focus on the most severe forms of the disease and those which can be treated. This study was undertaken to establish recommendations for the diagnosis of uveitis.

Methods

Recommendations were developed by a multidisciplinary panel of 14 experts, including internists, ophthalmologists, and rheumatologists, and are based on a review of the literature and the results of the ULISSE study, which was the first prospective study to assess the efficacy of a standardized strategy for the etiologic diagnosis of uveitis. The following groups of patients are not included in these recommendations: children, immunocompromised patients, patients with severe retinal vasculitis, and those with specific eye diseases diagnosed by ophthalmologic examination only.

Results

Diagnosis should be guided by the medical history of the patient and physical examination. Serologic screening for syphilis is appropriate in all forms of uveitis. If uveitis is not diagnosed at this stage, investigations oriented by the anatomic characteristics of uveitis are proposed. These consist of assays for HLA-B27 (in unilateral acute anterior non-granulomatous uveitis), serum angiotensin-converting enzyme, interferon-gamma release, chest computed tomography (chronic uveitis), cerebral magnetic resonance imaging and anterior chamber tap with interleukin-10 analysis (intermediate or posterior uveitis in patients > 40years-old). Other investigations prescribed in the absence of orientation are usually unhelpful.

Conclusions

A strategy is proposed for the etiologic diagnosis of uveitis. The benefit of more invasive investigations remains to be determined.

### Uveitis in children [^425e2f88]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The review provides updates on novel risk markers for the development of pediatric inflammatory uveitis and a severe disease course, on treatment of refractory disease, and on the measurement of visual outcomes.

Recent Findings

There are several new genetic markers, biomarkers, and clinical factors that may influence a child's uveitis disease course. It is important to identify children at risk for poor visual outcomes and who are refractory to traditional therapy. Racial disparities have recently been reported. We describe agents of potential benefit. In addition, we discuss the importance of patient reported outcomes in this population.

Summary

Uveitis can lead to vision-threatening complications. Timely and aggressive treatment of children identified to be at risk for a severe uveitis course may lead to improved outcomes.

### Interobserver agreement among uveitis experts on uveitic diagnoses: the standardization of uveitis nomenclature experience [^8aa285c8]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

To evaluate the interobserver agreement among uveitis experts on the diagnosis of the specific uveitic disease.

Design

Interobserver agreement analysis.

Methods

Five committees, each comprised of 9 individuals and working in parallel, reviewed cases from a preliminary database of 25 uveitic diseases, collected by disease, and voted independently online whether the case was the disease in question or not. The agreement statistic, κ, was calculated for the 36 pairwise comparisons for each disease, and a mean κ was calculated for each disease. After the independent online voting, committee consensus conference calls, using nominal group techniques, reviewed all cases not achieving supermajority agreement (> 75%) on the diagnosis in the online voting to attempt to arrive at a supermajority agreement.

Results

A total of 5766 cases for the 25 diseases were evaluated. The overall mean κ for the entire project was 0.39, with disease-specific variation ranging from 0.23 to 0.79. After the formalized consensus conference calls to address cases that did not achieve supermajority agreement in the online voting, supermajority agreement overall was reached on approximately 99% of cases, with disease-specific variation ranging from 96% to 100%.

Conclusions

Agreement among uveitis experts on diagnosis is moderate at best but can be improved by discussion among them. These data suggest the need for validated and widely used classification criteria in the field of uveitis.

### The eyes have it: a rheumatologist's view of uveitis [^7361efdc]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

Uveitis is defined as intraocular inflammation. It is an extraarticular manifestation of many forms of joint disease, which include spondyloarthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, and Behçet's disease. Rheumatologists may be asked to consult on the ophthalmologic care of patients with uveitis in order to identify an associated systemic illness. Diagnoses such as spondyloarthritis, sarcoidosis, and interstitial nephritis with uveitis are frequently overlooked by referring ophthalmologists. Alternatively, rheumatologists may be asked to help manage the patient's immunosuppression, including biologic therapy, which can be required to treat a subset of patients with uveitis. This review is intended to provide rheumatologists with the necessary information to facilitate collaboration in the comanagement of patients with uveitis.

### Outcomes important to patients with non-infectious posterior segment-involving uveitis: a qualitative study [^8315badd]. BMJ Open Ophthalmology (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Uveitis describes a group of disorders characterised by intraocular inflammation responsible for 10%–15% of total blindness in the developed world and up to 25% of blindness in the developing world. Uveitis may be due to (1) an infectious agent or (2) non-infectious inflammation, either as part of an underlying systemic disease or as an isolated ocular phenomenon. Although uveitis may affect any age group, it peaks in the working-age population and has a disproportionately high impact in terms of years of potential vision loss, need for long-term therapy and socioeconomic impact.

The most sight-threatening forms of uveitis are those that affect the posterior structures of the eye, classified anatomically as intermediate, posterior and panuveitis. In clinical trials, these forms of uveitis are often grouped together as non-infectious posterior segment-involving uveitis (PSIU), sharing a number of features including a higher risk of sight-threatening complications and often requiring systemic or local injection-based therapy. Uveitic macular oedema (UMO) is one of the common major complications in PSIU affecting around one-third of patients with uveitis.UMO is a leading cause of sight loss in patients since it affects the macula, which is responsible for detailed central vision. It, therefore, impacts a range of day-to-day activities such as reading, driving and working.

There is currently a major unmet need in the treatment of PSIU with a paucity of high-level evidence to allow evaluation and licensing of therapies by regulatory authoritiesand to inform treatment decisions by clinical experts and patients. The selection of outcome measures in trials is a critical issue, with evidence suggesting heterogeneity of outcomes used in recent clinical trials of uveitis, meaning that the outcomes from different trials may not be comparable. Further, patients, carers and health professionals may differ as to which outcomes they deem most important, and there may be a tendency for clinicians to undervalue outcomes that matter to patients. Consequently, these outcomes may not be included in uveitis research studies.

By understanding which outcomes matter to patients with uveitis and their carers, these perspectives can be included in the measured outcomes of uveitis trials to ensure that such trials are aligned to their priorities. These can be incorporated alongside the priorities of other stakeholders (clinicians, trialists, regulators and so on) into the construction of a core outcome set (COS) for uveitis, a recommended minimum set of outcomes to be assessed in all trials within the relevant health condition or group of conditions.

### Systematic review of clinical practice guidelines for uveitis [^11e849cc]. BMJ Open Ophthalmology (2023). High credibility.

Adalimumab and Dexamethasone for Treating Non-Infectious Uveitisis a guideline produced by the UK NICE, which is most concerned with providing guidance for medical practitioners working within the UK National Health Service. It specifically deals with the use of the biological treatment adalimumab, and with dexamethasone intravitreal implants, in cases of posterior uveitis. Within this narrow scope, its recommendations are clear and concise and were decided on by an appraisal committee, which heard evidence from clinical experts and received evidence from pharmaceutical companies. Included in this were results from randomised controlled trials. The guidance advised the use of adalimumab in cases of non-infectious posterior uveitis unresponsive to corticosteroid therapy, and dexamethasone intravitreal implant as an option if there is active posterior uveitis causing worsening vision with a risk of blindness. Expert opinion also advised that adalimumab therapy be halted if new choroidal or retinal inflammatory lesions developed, or if there was an increase in intraocular inflammation or a decrease in visual acuity by 3 or more lines or 15 letters while on treatment.

The Clinical Knowledge Summary on Uveitisproduced by the NICE provides general recommendations on uveitis covering clinical assessment, differential diagnosis and referral. It is explicitly meant to support practitioners in primary care, and recommendations were largely drawn from review articles and medical textbooks.

### A review and update on orphan drugs for the treatment of noninfectious uveitis [^b342da82]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Uveitis, a leading cause of preventable blindness around the world, is a critically underserved disease in regard to the medications approved for use. Multiple immunomodulatory therapy (IMT) drugs are appropriate for uveitis therapy but are still off-label. These IMT agents, including antimetabolites, calcineurin inhibitors, alkylating agents, and biologic agents, have been designated as "orphan drugs" and are widely used for systemic autoimmune diseases or organ transplantation.

Area Covered

The purpose of this paper is to comprehensively review and summarize the approved orphan drugs and biologics that are being used to treat systemic diseases and to discuss drugs that have not yet received approval as an "orphan drug for treating uveitis" by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

Our Perspective

IMT, as a steroid-sparing agent for uveitis patients, has shown promising clinical results. Refractory and recurrent uveitis requires combination IMT agents. IMT is continued for a period of 2 years while the patient is in remission before considering tapering medication. Our current goals include developing further assessments regarding the efficacy, optimal dose, and safety in efforts to achieve FDA approval for "on-label" use of current IMT agents and biologics more quickly and to facilitate insurance coverage and expand access to the products for this orphan disease.

### Intermediate uveitis associated with MS: diagnosis, clinical features, pathogenic mechanisms, and recommendations for management [^650d17df]. Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

MS and IU are both immune-mediated inflammatory diseases affecting immune-privileged sites in the eye and brain. Both disorders share similar immunopathogenic mechanisms, and, consequently, many of the same treatments are effective in the treatment of acute relapses and chronic inflammation in MS and IU, with the clear exception of anti-TNF therapies. An important consideration is that many of the treatments for MS and IU can cause visual and neurologic side effects and complications that may be confused with progression of either disease without careful examination, imaging and multidisciplinary team working between ophthalmologists and neurologists. However, there is a need for additional clinical trials to optimize management.

### Juvenile idiopathic arthritis-associated uveitis [^291ad536]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is the most common rheumatic disease of childhood, with JIA-associated uveitis its most common extra-articular manifestation. JIA-associated uveitis is a potentially sight-threatening condition and thus carries a considerable risk of morbidity. The aetiology of the condition is autoimmune in nature with the predominant involvement of CD4 + T cells. However, the underlying pathogenic mechanisms remain unclear, particularly regarding interplay between genetic and environmental factors. JIA-associated uveitis comes in several forms, but the most common presentation is of the chronic anterior uveitis type. This condition is usually asymptomatic and thus screening for JIA-associated uveitis in at-risk patients is paramount. Early detection and treatment aims to stop inflammation and prevent the development of complications leading to visual loss, which can occur due to both active disease and burden of disease treatment. Visually disabling complications of JIA-associated uveitis include cataracts, glaucoma, band keratopathy and macular oedema. There is a growing body of evidence for the early introduction of systemic immunosuppressive therapies in order to reduce topical and systemic glucocorticoid use. This includes more traditional treatments, such as methotrexate, as well as newer biological therapies. This review highlights the epidemiology of JIA-associated uveitis, the underlying pathogenesis and how affected patients may present. The current guidelines and criteria for screening, diagnosis and monitoring are discussed along with approaches to management.

### Etiology of uveitis in upper Egypt [^043e23f3]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

A large number of inflammatory ocular conditions can be grouped under the term "uveitis". And the etiologies of ocular inflammation vary to a great extent from one geographic place to another and show a prominent ethnic predisposition. Owing to the blinding potential of a large percentage of ocular inflammatory conditions, it is of critical importance to ophthalmologists to be well-oriented with the pattern of uveitis prevalent in the region of the world they serve in, as well as its common causes. This assists them proceed more successfully in their differential diagnosis plan, and timely instigate the most appropriate treatment. In this domain, a number of reports and studies have been published from different countries, in order to report and expose the predominant causes and forms of ocular inflammation in each country.

The present study aims to report the causes of uveitis among patients referred to a tertiary level hospital in Upper Egypt.

### Uveitis for dermatologists: a review [^45fc1e02]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Certain dermatologic conditions and drugs used for their treatment are associated with uveitis, a vision-threatening group of inflammatory eye diseases. Dermatologists may therefore be the first healthcare providers to recognize the presence of uveitis in certain patients and can help ensure morbidity is minimized. Posterior uveitis in particular, which may manifest as insidious, painless vision loss, may first be identified by a careful review of systems by a dermatologist. Understanding uveitis and its associations with certain skin findings and drugs will help enable identification and triage of patients in need of ophthalmic care. An overview of uveitis is provided, including its epidemiology, etiologies, classification, presenting signs and symptoms, general management, and complications. Next, dermatologic diseases that may be associated with uveitis are reviewed with a focus on how uveitis is most likely to present. Lastly, drugs used by dermatologists and less common dermatologic diseases associated with uveitis are reviewed. Multidisciplinary management is necessary for patients with both skin disease and ocular complications such as uveitis. Dermatologists&rsquo; recognition of uveitis in patients may reduce time to referral and improve patient outcomes. J Drugs Dermatol. 2020;19(12): doi:10.36849/JDD.2020.5165.

### New pharmacotherapy options for noninfectious posterior uveitis [^11fcf4a8]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Noninfectious posterior uveitis is a leading cause of visual impairment. Although conventional immunosuppressive agents have been successfully used, these are nonspecific and their long-term use may induce significant adverse effects. The purpose of this article is to identify recent advances and future therapeutic options in noninfectious posterior uveitis.

Areas Covered

A MEDLINE database search was conducted through May 2014 using the terms: uveitis, treatment, intravitreal and corticosteroid, biological. To provide ongoing and future perspectives in treatment options, also clinical trials as registered at ClinicalTrials.gov were included.

Expert Opinion

For individuals who do not respond to conventional immunotherapy, two major lines of treatments can be identified as focus in recent years: i) the intraocular application of anti-inflammatory drugs and ii) the introduction of new agents, for example, biologicals and small-molecule inhibitors. Whereas intravitreal treatments have the beauty of avoiding systemic side effects, new agents are gaining increased importance because of their highly targeted molecular effects. Even when current treatment strategies are still hampered by the paucity of randomized controlled trials, promising progress and continuous efforts are undertaken to close this gap. Still, a critical evaluation of new agents has to be made because 'new' agents are almost exclusively based on experience in other autoimmune disorders.

### Systemic therapies for inflammatory eye disease: past, present and future [^fd7942e0]. BMC Ophthalmology (2013). Low credibility.

These are exciting times with an ever-expanding range of immunosuppressants on the FDA-approved list. But the question remains: how much progress have we actually made? Put another way, when faced with a patient with sight-threatening inflammatory eye disease, do we actually know which drug to use?

Most of the immunosuppressants used in ocular inflammatory disease were originally developed for use in transplant medicine, rheumatic disease or other systemic inflammatory diseases. Very few have high level evidence for their use in ocular inflammation, and almost all are used off-label. A recent study which surveyed uveitis experts' approach to a number of clinical scenarios, found that whilst there was a general consensus on the overall approach to immunosuppression (i.e. starting with corticosteroids first line, and subsequent initiation of a steroid-sparing immunosuppressant) there was considerable variation in which second line agent to use and at what dose. This is perhaps unsurprising since the study also reported that these experts suggested the evidence underlying their decisions was either absent or relatively weak (evidence levels III or IV based on the evidential hierarchy described by the United States Agency for Health Care Policy and Research), and that in most cases personal experience was a key factor in their decision-making. In this regard we should not under-estimate recent progress which has seen an increasing number of prospective studies on standard and novel therapies, and larger standardized retrospective studies. A balanced approach is needed. Our current shortage of large-scale randomized controlled trials should not lead to us ignore the evidence that is already available for therapeutic efficacy and safety. Conversely we must recognize the 'evidence-gap' that remains and identify strategies that will enable us to bridge it.

There are a number of reasons we lag behind other specialties, notably our small target population, heterogeneous disease groups, poorly defined phenotypes, uncertain pathogenesis, diagnostic inconsistency, subjective outcome measures, visual acuity issues, and until recently little commercial interest and a non-trial culture. These are some of the factors that need to be addressed if we are to conduct the trials and build the evidence base which will enable us to make informed therapeutic decisions in the future.

### Uveitis, the comparison of age-related macular degeneration treatments trials (CATT), and intravitreal biologics for ocular inflammation [^88c1092f]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose

To provide perspective on the implications of the Comparison of Age-Related Macular Degeneration Treatments Trials (CATT) on intravitreal biologic agents in uveitis and retinal diseases in which ocular inflammatory pathways are central to their pathogenesis.

Design

Interpretative essay.

Methods

Literature review and interpretation.

Results

Besides the clear importance of CATT from a patient treatment perspective in age-related macular degeneration (AMD), these data highlight the critical relevance of highly specific protein immunotherapies offered with biologic agents. The CATT trial also provides a reminder regarding the importance of rigorous efficacy and safety monitoring required when administering intravitreal biologic therapy. Within the field of uveitis, systemic and local biologics have been used to effectively treat uveitis, targeting pathways implicated in both angiogenesis and inflammation (eg, tumor necrosis factor-α [TNF-α] and interleukin-2 pathways), and research on intravitreal biologic therapy for uveitis and AMD will continue to expand. With over 25 ongoing clinical trials on intravitreal biologic therapy for AMD, enthusiasm for vanguard biologic therapies should be tempered by judicious monitoring for adverse events.

Conclusion

The importance of the CATT trial encompasses day-to-day treatment decisions for AMD, as well as lessons on how biologics for ocular disease should be implemented into clinical practice. Specifically, the introduction of intravitreal biologic therapies into clinical practice for uveitis, AMD, and other ocular diseases in which inflammation is involved should be guided by a clear understanding of the immunotherapeutic agent and its molecular target and with rigorous monitoring for both patient benefit and patient safety.

### Pharmacotherapy for uveitis: current management and emerging therapy [^79ef5a8b]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Uveitis, a significant cause of blindness worldwide, is a term applied to a wide range of conditions that are characterized by intraocular inflammation. Many cases of "uveitis" do indeed involve inflammation of the uvea (which comprises the iris, ciliary body, and choroid), but may also involve adjacent structures such as the retina or vitreous. Uveitis is highly heterogeneous, varying in etiology, pattern, tissue involved, and extent. The uveitis specialist may be confronted by a small, localized area of inflammation in a single tissue in a non-sight-threatening location, or widespread blinding inflammation involving almost all ocular tissues. Visual impairment is common, affecting between 2.8% and 10% of patients,–and may result directly from damage to uveal tract structures, or may occur due to secondary effects on neighboring tissues: for example, accelerated cataract formation, glaucoma, and macular edema.

The Standardization of Uveitis Nomenclature (SUN) working group classifies uveitis according to the site of primary inflammation. Anterior chamber inflammation is categorized as "anterior uveitis", and includes iritis, iridocyclitis, and anterior cyclitis. Inflammation primarily affecting the vitreous is referred to as "intermediate uveitis", and includes pars planitis, posterior cyclitis, and hyalitis. "Posterior uveitis" describes inflammation of the retina or choroid. Finally, "pan-uveitis" describes the situation where inflammation is seen throughout the anterior chamber, vitreous, and retina or choroid. According to the SUN criteria, disease is further classified according to onset (sudden or insidious), duration (limited or persistent), and course (acute, recurrent, or chronic).

### Neural networks for predicting etiological diagnosis of uveitis [^7485955e]. Eye (2025). Medium credibility.

Summary

What was known before

Evaluation of four diagnosis decision support systems in uveitis found a correct diagnosis from 54% to 74% of cases.
These computer-aided systems have limitations and are not used in daily clinical practice.

What this study adds

The most probable diagnosis of uveitis with unknown etiology by the neural network matched the senior clinician diagnosis in 292 of 375 patients (77.8%). It reached 93% when the two most probable diagnoses were considered.
This algorithm might be used as a medical decision-making tool for the clinical management of uveitis with undetermined etiology after an ophthalmological examination.

Methods

This systematic review of CPGs was conducted in compliance with the methodology presented in the introductory PECI paper. Exclusion criteria for each stage of screening below are provided in table 1. The stages in the review are as follows:

Table 1
Exclusion criteria for screening of clinical practice guidelines (CPGs)

Systematic literature search

A single, systematic literature search of selected academic (MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Global Health, Global Index Medicus) and guideline databases (online supplemental Appendix 1) was carried out by a CEV information specialist in March 2020. MeSH terms were used where applicable. In addition, the websites of professional ophthalmology and optometry associations' were searched for relevant guidelines (online supplemental Appendix 1). All searches were limited to the last 10 years, to ensure evidence was current, and to English language, to ensure timely completion of the PECI. The search strategy for academic databases can be found in online supplemental Appendix 2.

Title and abstract screening

Two members of the technical working group independently screened the titles and abstracts of articles identified from the systematic literature searches. Title and abstracts were presented, and responses tracked, using Abstrackr, a semiautomated online citation screening programme. Citations were excluded if they were not in the English language, not a CPG or were not relevant to a priority eye condition. A secondary title and abstract screening was then conducted to identify CPGs potentially relevant to uveitis. All disagreements were resolved by discussion between a CEV representative and the WHO.

Full-text screening

Following title and abstract screening, independent full-text screening of the CPGs relevant to uveitis was conducted by two authors (NG and IRR). CPGs without author affiliations listed, or with undisclosed or unmanaged conflicts of interest, were excluded. Discrepancies were resolved through discussion between the two authors or, in the event a consensus couldn't be reached, by discussion with a third author.

### Anti-tumour necrosis factor biological therapies for the treatment of uveitic macular oedema (UMO) for non-infectious uveitis [^9d4071f0]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Non-infectious uveitis describes a heterogenous group of ocular disorders characterised by intraocular inflammation in the absence of infection. Uveitis is a leading cause of visual loss, most commonly due to uveitic macular oedema (UMO). Treatment is aimed at reducing disease activity by suppression of the intraocular inflammatory response. In the case of macular oedema, the aim is to restore macular architecture as quickly as possible, in order to prevent irreversible photoreceptor damage in this area. Acute exacerbations are typically managed with corticosteroids, which may be administered topically, locally or systemically. Whilst these are often rapidly effective in achieving disease control, long-term use is associated with significant local and systemic side effects, and 'steroid sparing agents' are typically used to achieve prolonged control in severe or recalcitrant disease. Anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF) drugs block a critical cytokine in the inflammatory signalling process, and have emerged as effective steroid-sparing immunomodulatory agents in a wide range of non-ocular conditions. There is mechanistic data to suggest that they may provide a more targeted approach to disease control in UMO than other agents, but to date, these agents have predominantly been used 'off label' as the majority are not licensed for ocular use. This review aims to summarise the available literature reporting the use of anti-TNF therapy in UMO, thus developing the evidence-base on which to make future treatment decisions and develop clinical guidelines in this area.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy of anti-TNF therapy in treatment of UMO.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2018, Issue 2), which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register; Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; LILACS; Web of Science Conference Proceedings Citation Index- Science (CPCI-S); System for Information on Grey Literature in Europe (OpenGrey); the ISRCTN registry; ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO ICTRP. The date of the search was 29 March 2018.

Selection Criteria

We planned to include all relevant randomised controlled trials assessing the use of anti-TNF agents in treatment of UMO. No limits were applied to participant age, gender or ethnicity. The primary comparisons of this review were: anti-TNF versus no treatment or placebo; anti-TNF versus another pharmacological agent; comparison of different anti-TNF drugs; comparison of different doses and routes of administration of the same anti-TNF drug. The primary outcome measure that we assessed for this review was best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) in the treated eye. Secondary outcome measures were anatomical macular change, clinical estimation of vitreous haze and health-related quality of life.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened titles and abstracts retrieved through the database searches. We retrieved full-text reports of studies categorised as 'unsure' or 'include' after we had reviewed the abstracts. Two review authors independently reviewed each full-text report for eligibility. We resolved discrepancies through discussion.

Main Results

We identified no completed or ongoing trial that was eligible for this Cochrane Review.

Authors' Conclusions

Our review did not identify any evidence from randomised controlled trials for or against the role of anti-TNF agents in the management of UMO. Although there are a number of high-quality randomised controlled trials that demonstrate the efficacy of anti-TNF agents in preventing recurrence of inflammation in uveitis, the reported study outcomes do not include changes in UMO. As a result, there were insufficient data to conclude whether there was a significant treatment effect specifically for UMO. Future trials should be designed to include quantitative measures of UMO as primary study outcomes, for example by reporting the presence or absence of UMO, or by measuring central macular thickness for study participants. Furthermore, whilst UMO is an important complication of uveitis, we acknowledge that uveitis is associated with many significant structural and functional complications. It is not possible to determine treatment efficacy based on a single outcome measure. We recommend that future reviews of therapeutic interventions in uveitis should use composite measures of treatment response comprising a range of potential complications of disease.

### Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors for juvenile idiopathic arthritis-associated uveitis [^f4675891]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Uveitis is the most common extra-articular manifestation of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) and a potentially sight-threatening condition characterized by intraocular inflammation. Current treatment for JIA-associated uveitis (JIA-U) is largely based on physician experience, observational evidence and consensus guidelines, resulting in considerable variations in practice. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors used for treatment of JIA-U.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); Ovid MEDLINE; Embase.com; PubMed; Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature Database (LILACS); ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). We last searched the electronic databases on 3 February 2022.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing TNF inhibitors with placebo in participants with a diagnosis of JIA and uveitis who were aged 2 to 18 years old.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methodology and graded the certainty of the body of evidence for seven outcomes using the GRADE classification.

Main Results

We included three RCTs with 134 participants. One study conducted in the USA randomized participants to etanercept or placebo (N = 12). Two studies, one conducted in the UK (N = 90) and one in France (N = 32), randomized participants to adalimumab or placebo. All studies were at low risk of bias. Initial pooled estimates suggested that TNF-inhibitors may result in little to no difference on treatment success defined as 0 to trace cells on Standardization of Uveitis Nomenclature (SUN)-grading; or two-step decrease in activity based on SUN grading (estimated risk ratio (RR) 0.66; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.21 to 2.10; 2 studies; 43 participants; low-certainty evidence) or treatment failure defined as a two-step increase in activity based on SUN grading (RR 0.31; 95% CI 0.01 to 7.15; 1 study; 31 participants; low-certainty evidence). Further analysis using the individual trial definitions of treatment response and failure suggested a positive treatment effect of TNF inhibitors; a RR of treatment success of 2.60 (95% CI 1.30 to 5.20; 3 studies; 124 participants; low-certainty evidence), and RR of treatment failure of 0.23 (95% CI 0.11 to 0.50; 3 studies; 133 participants). Almost all the evidence was on adalimumab and the evidence on etanercept was very limited. For secondary outcomes, one study suggests that adalimumab may have little to no effect on risk of recurrence after induction of remission at three months (RR 2.50, 95% CI 0.31 to 20.45; 90 participants; very low-certainty evidence) and visual acuity, but the evidence is very uncertain; mean difference in longitudinal logMAR score change over six months was -0.01 (95% CI -0.06 to 0.03) and -0.02 (95% CI -0.07 to 0.03) using the best and worst logMAR measurement, respectively (low-certainty evidence). Low-certainty evidence from one study suggested that adalimumab treatment results in reduction of topical steroid doses at six months (hazard ratio 3.58; 95% CI 1.24 to 10.32; 74 participants who took one or more topical steroid per day at baseline). Adverse events, including injection site reactions and infections, were more common in the TNF inhibitor group. Serious adverse events were uncommon.

Authors' Conclusions

Adalimumab appears to increase the likelihood of treatment success and decrease the likelihood of treatment failure when compared with placebo. The evidence was less conclusive about a positive treatment effect with etanercept. Adverse events from JIA-U trials are in keeping with the known side effect profile of TNF inhibitors. Standard validated JIA-U outcome measures are required to homogenize assessment and to allow for comparison and analysis of multiple datasets.
