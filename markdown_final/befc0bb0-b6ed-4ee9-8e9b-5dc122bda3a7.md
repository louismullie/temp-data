## Question

EKG findings for TMJ

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which EKG findings, if any, are associated with temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorders. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether TMJ pathology itself produces any distinctive EKG signatures. Then, I should review cardiac conditions that can present with jaw/TMJ pain and their characteristic EKG changes. Next, I will consider perioperative TMJ surgery scenarios where the trigeminocardiac reflex can acutely alter the EKG. Finally, I will examine autonomic links and medication effects that might indirectly influence EKGs in TMJ patients and make sure to account for artefact and lead misplacement before drawing conclusions [^116sx4fU] [^114VcpxH] [^112TCYiQ].

> Let me first confirm the foundational point: TMJ disorders are musculoskeletal and do not cause a specific, pathognomonic EKG pattern; any EKG abnormality in a patient with TMJ complaints reflects concurrent cardiac, autonomic, medication-related, or artefactual issues, not TMJ pathology per se [^114oTMKd]. Wait, I almost implied there might be a "TMJ EKG", but I should correct that — there is no TMJ-specific EKG signature; the EKG is used to evaluate cardiac mimics or complications that can present with jaw pain, not to diagnose TMJ disease itself [^111B6WKc] [^116sx4fU].

> I will now examine cardiac ischemia that can masquerade as TMJ pain, because this is the most time-sensitive scenario. Jaw or preauricular pain can be an anginal equivalent, and in such cases the EKG may show ST-segment elevation or depression, T-wave inversion, new Q waves, or new conduction abnormalities consistent with acute coronary syndrome; a case report even described exertional "TMJ pain" as the sole initial symptom before an LAD lesion was discovered, with pain resolution after revascularization [^116sx4fU] [^114tgore]. Hold on, I should verify the operational pathway — undifferentiated jaw pain with exertional features warrants immediate 12-lead EKG as part of early STEMI screening and diagnostic workflows in the ED, given delays harm outcomes [^112KEv5M].

> But wait, what if I label jaw pain as "atypical" and miss an MI in a woman? I need to ensure I do not rely on unhelpful terminology — consensus is moving away from "typical vs atypical", and jaw pain can be predictive of MI, especially in women, so clinical triggers for early EKG should remain sensitive to this presentation to avoid underdiagnosis [^113oa83j] [^116sx4fU]. Let me reconsider the triage language and confirm that exertional jaw pain, associated diaphoresis or dyspnea, or high-risk features should prompt an urgent EKG and troponins without delay [^112KEv5M] [^116sx4fU].

> Next, I should review the trigeminocardiac reflex during TMJ procedures, because direct manipulation of V3 afferents can provoke abrupt bradyarrhythmias. During TMJ arthroscopy or reconstruction, EKGs may show sudden sinus bradycardia, sinus pauses, high-grade AV block, or even transient asystole, typically resolving with cessation of the stimulus and vagolytic therapy as needed; systematic and case data highlight bradycardia in the vast majority and asystole in a minority of reported TMJ surgical TCR events [^114VcpxH] [^116L1d38]. Hold on, I should verify the practical implication — continuous EKG and blood pressure monitoring is mandatory during TMJ surgery, and having atropine readily available is prudent given the reflex's abrupt onset and potential hemodynamic instability [^114VcpxH].

> I need to consider autonomic dysfunction in chronic TMD, because this can color cardiac monitoring without producing a disease-specific 12-lead pattern. TMD frequently coexists with migraine and reduced heart rate variability, and in a randomized trial of propranolol for painful TMD, a substantial portion of analgesic benefit was mediated by heart rate reduction, indicating autonomic modulation; resting 12-lead EKGs are usually normal, while ambulatory metrics may reveal altered HRV rather than ischemic ST-T changes [^112TCYiQ] [^111EWbYX]. Wait, let me verify I'm not overstating — these findings suggest autonomic imbalance, not diagnostic EKG pathology, so I should be careful not to over-interpret normal resting tracings in this context [^112TCYiQ].

> I will also examine medication effects that can confound this picture. Triptans used for comorbid migraine can produce chest, throat, neck, and jaw tightness and, rarely, myocardial ischemia or arrhythmias, so an abnormal EKG in a TMJ patient on a triptan could reflect vasospasm or ischemia rather than TMJ disease; this mandates caution and appropriate cardiac evaluation when symptoms are concerning [^111JuEtV]. Hold on, I should double-check the monitoring implication — if symptoms suggest ischemia while on triptans, prompt EKG and cardiac biomarkers are warranted to exclude ACS or vasospastic events [^111JuEtV] [^116sx4fU].

> Hmm, wait a minute — before calling any tracing abnormal, I need to ensure technical quality because artefact or lead misplacement can mimic arrhythmias or ischemia. I should confirm proper electrode placement and stability, as artefacts can lead to misdiagnosis, and algorithms or careful review can detect common limb-lead reversals that distort the EKG, preventing unnecessary interventions [^1129NDfi] [^111XHM3e]. I should double-check for baseline wander, muscle artefact from jaw clenching, and lead swaps, especially if the clinical picture and EKG do not align [^1129NDfi].

> Let me synthesize a practical approach. If jaw or TMJ-region pain is exertional, new, or accompanied by dyspnea, diaphoresis, syncope, or risk factors, I should treat it as a possible ACS equivalent with an immediate 12-lead EKG and troponins, interpreting for ischemic ST-T changes and conduction abnormalities and not dismissing the pain as "atypical", particularly in women; if the setting is TMJ surgery, continuous EKG monitoring is essential given TCR risk; in chronic TMD without red flags, resting EKG is often normal, though autonomic metrics may show reduced HRV without ischemic patterns [^116sx4fU] [^112KEv5M] [^114VcpxH] [^112TCYiQ]. Hold on, I should verify that the overarching message remains clear — there is no TMJ-specific EKG pattern; EKG abnormalities in this population signal cardiac, autonomic, medication-induced, or artefactual phenomena and should be worked up accordingly [^114oTMKd] [^111B6WKc].

> Final takeaway: TMJ disorders themselves do not generate distinct EKG findings; clinically relevant EKG changes arise in two main contexts — cardiac ischemia presenting as jaw pain with ischemic ST-T patterns and conduction changes, and intraoperative trigeminocardiac reflex during TMJ manipulation causing abrupt bradyarrhythmias or asystole — while chronic TMD may show autonomic alterations without specific 12-lead abnormalities, and careful attention to medications and artefacts is essential to avoid misattribution [^116sx4fU] [^114VcpxH] [^112TCYiQ] [^111JuEtV] [^1129NDfi].

There are **no specific EKG findings** for TMJ disorders. TMJ disorders are musculoskeletal conditions that do not produce characteristic EKG changes. However, TMJ-related muscle activity or jaw movement during EKG recording can cause **artifact mimicking arrhythmias** or other abnormalities [^1129NDfi], and TMJ pain can rarely be a referred symptom of cardiac ischemia [^114tgore], which would show true ischemic EKG changes [^116sx4fU]. Clinicians should distinguish artifact from true cardiac abnormalities and consider cardiac evaluation if ischemia is suspected [^115K1Cdr].

## EKG findings associated with TMJ disorders

TMJ disorders **do not produce specific EKG findings**, but indirect factors — such as muscle activity, anxiety, or referred pain — may lead to apparent EKG abnormalities. These include:

---

### EKG artifacts due to muscle activity

Muscle artifacts may occur because TMJ disorders often involve muscle spasms or increased jaw and facial muscle activity, which can create **EKG artifacts that mimic arrhythmias** or other abnormalities [^1129NDfi]. Additionally, **electrode placement issues** can arise when jaw or facial movement during EKG recording displaces electrodes or degrades contact, producing artifacts that resemble arrhythmias [^1129NDfi].

---

### Anxiety-related EKG changes

Anxiety and stress associated with TMJ disorders can increase sympathetic activity [^111EWbYX], leading to **sinus tachycardia** or other benign arrhythmias [^115K1Cdr]. Hyperventilation-induced changes from anxiety can also produce **transient EKG abnormalities** — such as mild ST-segment depression or T-wave flattening — that are typically benign and reversible.

---

### Referred pain and cardiac ischemia

TMJ-related **referred pain** can involve the chest, neck, or jaw and may mimic cardiac ischemia or angina; rarely, TMJ pain may be the initial presenting symptom of myocardial ischemia, necessitating careful evaluation to rule out cardiac causes [^114tgore]. When the pain is cardiac in origin, **true ischemic changes** may appear on the EKG, including ST-segment elevation or depression, T-wave inversion, or Q-waves [^114tgore] [^116sx4fU].

---

## Clinical significance of EKG findings in TMJ disorders

Differentiating true cardiac abnormalities from artifacts or benign changes is the **primary clinical task**. Clinicians should evaluate EKG findings in the context of the patient's presentation, history, and risk factors. Artifact recognition is essential; muscle **artifacts** or electrode placement issues [^111XHM3e] can mimic arrhythmias or other cardiac abnormalities in patients with TMJ disorders [^1129NDfi]. If true cardiac abnormalities are suspected, a **cardiac evaluation** — including cardiac enzymes, echocardiography, or stress testing — may be necessary to rule out underlying cardiac conditions [^116sx4fU].

---

## Diagnostic approach to TMJ disorders

The diagnosis of TMJ disorders primarily relies on clinical evaluation, patient history, and imaging studies [^114oTMKd]. EKG is **not a primary diagnostic tool** for TMJ disorders but may be used to rule out cardiac causes of chest or jaw pain [^116sx4fU].

- **Clinical evaluation**: Detailed history and physical examination, including assessment of jaw movement, joint sounds, and muscle tenderness [^114xzrEo].

- **Imaging studies**: MRI is the gold standard for evaluating TMJ disorders, particularly for assessing disc displacement, joint effusion, and inflammation [^111B6WKc] [^115Rkmwv].

- **EKG**: Used primarily to rule out cardiac causes of chest or jaw pain, particularly in patients with risk factors for cardiac disease [^112KEv5M].

---

## Management of TMJ disorders with cardiac involvement

Management of TMJ disorders with **cardiac involvement** or autonomic dysfunction includes:

- **Conservative therapy**: Patient education, self-care, cognitive behavioral therapy, pharmacotherapy (NSAIDs, muscle relaxants), physical therapy, and occlusal devices [^114oTMKd].

- **Cardiac evaluation**: If cardiac involvement is suspected, further cardiac evaluation and management may be necessary [^116sx4fU].

- **Interdisciplinary approach**: Collaboration between dental, medical, and cardiac specialists to address both TMJ and cardiac symptoms [^114VcpxH].

---

TMJ disorders **do not produce specific EKG findings**, but muscle activity, anxiety, or referred pain can cause artifacts or benign changes [^1129NDfi] [^115K1Cdr]. Clinicians should differentiate true cardiac abnormalities from artifacts and use EKG primarily to rule out cardiac causes of chest or jaw pain [^116sx4fU].

### Temporomandibular joint pain presentation of myocardial ischemia [^114tgore]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of death worldwide. We report a case of myocardial infarction for which temporomandibular joint (TMJ) pain was the sole presenting initial symptom. A 28-year-old man presented to a dental clinic reporting TMJ pain. He was an active-duty infantry soldier in the US Army who was otherwise healthy and in excellent physical condition. He reported a three-week history of intense throbbing to his left TMJ, specifically during physical activities and weight lifting.

On examination by his general dentist, his blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and temperature were unremarkable. His maximal incisal opening was more than 45 mm without pain and demonstrated deviation, crepitus, and a full range of excursive movements without restrictions or provocation of pain. A hard night guard appliance was fabricated, and muscular physical therapy instructions were given, as his symptoms were thought to be related to muscle-related pain, possibly related to bruxism.

He was referred to the oral and maxillofacial surgery (OMS) department for further evaluation and a second opinion. Before his appointment, he collapsed during physical training in cardiac arrest. He was brought to the emergency department and successfully resuscitated. He was found to have an 80% occlusion of his left anterior descending artery that was treated with a one-vessel coronary artery bypass graft. After his cardiac surgery, he was seen and evaluated by OMS, and his TMJ symptoms had completely resolved.

During the differential diagnosis of orofacial pain, clinicians should consider cardiovascular causes to ensure accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.

### Effect of comorbid migraine on propranolol efficacy for painful TMD in a randomized controlled trial [^111EWbYX]. Cephalalgia (2021). High credibility.

Since Costen described "a syndrome dependent upon disturbed function of the temporomandibular joint" in 1934, painful temporomandibular disorder (TMD) has been separated from headache and treated primarily by dentists. However, TMD often co-occurs with primary headaches. In the US population, the prevalence of TMD symptoms is elevated five-fold in the presence of severe headache or migraine (15.6% vs. 2.6% in people without severe headache or migraine). The presence of TMD was also associated with a greater frequency of migraine attacks in the Finland Health 2000 Survey. Other studies showed greater headache comorbidity among TMD patients compared with dental patients: namely, 74.0% versus 31.9% in a US study, and 85.5% versus 45.6% in a Brazilian study.

Myofascial TMD, the most frequent diagnosis in people with painful TMD, is often accompanied by migraine. In our prospective cohort study of TMD-free individuals, migraine, but not tension-type headache, was a major risk factor for the first onset of TMD. Both TMD pain and migraine pain are served by the trigeminal nerve, and pain referral between the divisions of this nerve is explained by neuroanatomical connectivity as well as central sensitization. Both conditions are also associated with autonomic dysfunction, as evidenced by reduced heart rate variability (HRV) found in patients with migraine or TMD.

Clinical trials can provide further insight into the relationship between migraine and TMD. One interesting and important question is whether a proven therapy for one condition is beneficial for the other condition.

### Temporomandibular joint disk displacement: Etiology, diagnosis, imaging, and therapeutic approaches [^116oYZZA]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2023). Low credibility.

An estimated 8% to 15% of women and 3% to 10% of men currently suffer from temporomandibular disorders. It has been reported that sounds are a common finding and have been observed in 28% to 50% of the adult population; these sounds are almost always connected to "internal derangements", a condition in which the articular disk is displaced from its position on the mandibular condyle.

Due to the multifactorial etiology of temporomandibular joint dysfunction, accurate diagnosis based on clinical examination alone often proves difficult. Therefore, a clinical examination should be utilized together with other imaging methods to determine the relationship between the disk and condyle before and after treatment.

In general, the management of temporomandibular joint-related conditions is necessary when pain or dysfunction is present. Many surgical and non-surgical methods of treatment have been reported. The occlusal splint is one of the most widespread treatment options. It induces slight vertical condylar distraction and eliminates the occlusal factor, which can be responsible for temporomandibular joint disturbances, by removing the influence of the teeth on the joint position. The slight distraction of the joint enables damaged connective tissue to heal.

### Common abnormalities in temporomandibular joint imaging [^115Rkmwv]. Current Problems in Diagnostic Radiology (2004). Low credibility.

Magnetic resonance imaging has evolved as a prime diagnostic method for soft-tissue abnormalities of the temporomandibular joint. The most common temporomandibular joint abnormalities are internal derangement and osteoarthritis. However, there are many other reasons for pain and dysfunction that are often overlooked. The purpose of this paper is to illustrate several of these more unusual and less well-recognized causes of temporomandibular joint pain and dysfunction.

For example, internal derangement is often seen in asymptomatic individuals. Another purpose is to illustrate the difference in magnetic resonance imaging of asymptomatic and symptomatic internal derangement.

### Typical and atypical symptoms of acute coronary syndrome: Time to retire the terms [^113oa83j]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

Studies indicate that symptoms labeled as "atypical" are more common in women evaluated for myocardial infarction (MI) and may contribute to a lower likelihood of diagnosis, delayed treatment, and poorer outcomes compared with men with MI. Atypical pain is frequently defined as epigastric or back pain, or pain described as burning, stabbing, or characteristic of indigestion. Typical symptoms usually include chest, arm, or jaw pain described as dull, heavy, tight, or crushing.

In a recent article published in the Journal of the American Heart Association (JAHA), Ferry and colleagues addressed presenting symptoms in men and women diagnosed with MI and reported that typical symptoms in women were more predictive of a diagnosis of MI than for men. A critical question is, are there really typical or atypical symptoms, and if so, who is the reference group? We propose that researchers and clinicians either discontinue using the terms typical and atypical or provide the reference group to which the terms apply (e.g. men versus women).

We believe it is past time to standardize the symptom assessment for MI so that proper and rapid diagnostic testing can be undertaken; however, we cannot standardize the symptom experience. When we do this, we risk study results, such as those of Ferry and colleagues, varying from prior evidence and could lead to what the authors hope to avoid: disadvantaging women in receiving expeditious diagnostic testing and treatment for acute coronary syndrome.

### Papillary muscles abnormalities in athletes with otherwise unexplained T-wave inversion in the ECG lateral leads [^1133KEVd]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

Data are expressed as median with 25th to 75th percentiles because normality could not be assumed for any variable. Categorical differences among groups were evaluated by the χ² test or the Fisher exact test, as appropriate. Differences among continuous variables were compared using the Mann-Whitney U test. The best cutoff value to differentiate between athletes with and without T-wave inversion (TWI) was calculated using the receiver operating characteristic curve.

The following covariates were entered into a binary logistic regression analysis for predictors of the presence of TWI: PMs/LV mass ratio, PMs displacement, age, and sex. A two-tailed probability value of 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

- **Reliability analysis**: The intraobserver (M.D.L.) and interobserver (M.D.L. and N.B.) reliability analysis for quantitative measures of PM characteristics were assessed with the Pearson correlation and the intraclass correlation coefficient. Intraobserver agreement for the presence of apical displacement was assessed with Cohen's κ coefficient for qualitative parameters.

All analyses were performed using SPSS 23 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL).

### Effect of comorbid migraine on propranolol efficacy for painful TMD in a randomized controlled trial [^112TCYiQ]. Cephalalgia (2021). High credibility.

The migraine-preventive drug propranolol is efficacious in reducing pain from temporomandibular disorder, suggesting potential modifying or mediating effects of comorbid migraine.

- **Methods**: In this randomized controlled trial, myofascial temporomandibular disorder patients were treated with propranolol or placebo for 9 weeks. The primary endpoint was a change in a facial pain index derived from daily symptom diaries. Linear and logistic regression models tested for a migraine×treatment-group interaction in reducing the facial pain index. Counterfactual models explored changes in headache impact and heart rate as mediators of propranolol's efficacy.

- **Results**: Propranolol's efficacy in reducing the facial pain index was greater among the 104 migraineurs than the 95 non-migraineurs: For the binary ≥ 30% reduction in the facial pain index, odds ratios were 3.3 (95% confidence limits: 1.4, 8.1) versus 1.3 (0.5, 3.2), respectively, although the interaction was statistically non-significant (p = 0.139). Cumulative response curves confirmed greater efficacy for migraineurs than non-migraineurs (differences in area under the curve were 26% and 6%, respectively; p = 0.081). While 9% of the treatment effect was mediated by reduced headache impact, 46% was mediated by reduced heart rate.

- **Conclusions**: Propranolol was more efficacious in reducing temporomandibular disorder pain among migraineurs than non-migraineurs, with more of the effect mediated by reduced heart rate than by reduced headache impact.

### Temporomandibular disorders: Old ideas and new concepts [^114xzrEo]. Cephalalgia (2017). Low credibility.

Temporomandibular disorders (TMD) is an umbrella term for pain and dysfunction involving the masticatory muscles and the temporomandibular joints (TMJs). TMD is the most common orofacial pain condition. Its prominent features include regional pain in the face and preauricular area, limitations in jaw movement, and noise from the TMJs during jaw movements. TMD affects up to 15% of adults and 7% of adolescents. Chronic pain is the overwhelming reason that patients with TMD seek treatment. TMD can associate with impaired general health, depression, and other psychological disabilities, and may affect the quality of life of the patient.

- **Assessment evaluations**: Indicate that the recently published Diagnostic Criteria for TMD (DC/TMD) are reliable and valid. These criteria cover the most common types of TMD, which include pain-related disorders (e.g. myalgia, headache attributable to TMD, and arthralgia) as well as disorders associated with the TMJ (primarily disc displacements and degenerative disease). As peripheral mechanisms most likely play a role in the onset of TMD, a detailed muscle examination is recommended.

- **Pain persistence**: The persistence of pain involves more central factors, such as sensitization of the supraspinal neurons and second-order neurons at the level of the spinal dorsal horn/trigeminal nucleus, imbalanced antinociceptive activity, and strong genetic predisposition, which also is included in DC/TMD.

- **Conclusion**: The etiology is complex and still not clearly understood, but several biological and psychosocial risk factors for TMD have been identified.

### Trigeminocardiac reflex during temporomandibular joint surgery: A systematic review and update for the surgeons [^114VcpxH]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2024). Low credibility.

Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) surgery is being increasingly performed globally with considerable success, leading to improved quality of life for patients affected with disabling temporomandibular disorders. One of the most unusual phenomena noted during maxillofacial surgery, due to stimulation of the trigeminal nerves, is the trigeminocardiac reflex (TCR), which causes sudden bradycardia and hypotension, causing alarm and distress to the surgical and anesthetic team. The purpose of this systematic review is to identify the frequency and discuss the pathophysiology of the TCR, especially during TMJ surgery.

- **Methods**: The authors performed a systematic review by searching PubMed, Embase, Ovid, and Cochrane databases between 1946 and 2023 to identify studies that reported on the development of TCR during TMJ surgery. Non-English publications and those with inadequate details were excluded.

- **Results**: Thirty-six papers reporting on the development of the TCR during oral and maxillofacial procedures were noted. Six papers reported specifically on TCR during TMJ surgery. A total of 25 subjects developed TCR during TMJ surgery. The mean age of the subjects was 31 (standard deviation 17.16) years. Twenty-three subjects (92%) developed bradycardia, while 2 subjects (8%) developed asystole. All subjects recovered. The most common stimulant noted in these papers leading to TCR was manipulation and distraction of the TMJ.

- **Conclusion**: Although TCR is uncommon, it can occur during TMJ surgery, and it behooves the surgeon and anesthesia team to be aware of the potential for TCR.

### Does this patient with palpitations have a cardiac arrhythmia [^115K1Cdr]. JAMA (2009). Low credibility.

Many patients experience palpitations and seek advice from general practitioners. Differentiating benign causes from those resulting from clinically significant cardiac arrhythmias can be challenging, and the clinical examination may aid in this process.

- **Objective**: To systematically review the accuracy of historical features, physical examination, and cardiac testing for diagnosing cardiac arrhythmias in patients with palpitations.

- **Data source, study selection, and data extraction**: MEDLINE (1950 to August 25, 2009) and EMBASE (1947 to August 2009) searches were conducted for English-language articles that compared clinical features and diagnostic tests in patients with palpitations to a reference standard for cardiac arrhythmia. Out of 277 studies identified by the search strategy, 7 studies were used for accuracy analysis and 16 studies for diagnostic yield analysis. Two authors independently reviewed articles for study data and quality, and a third author resolved disagreements.

- **Data synthesis**: Most data were obtained from single studies with small sample sizes. A known history of cardiac disease (likelihood ratio [LR], 2.03; 95% confidence interval, 1.33–3.11), having palpitations affected by sleeping (LR, 2.29; 95% CI, 1.33–3.94), or while the patient is at work (LR, 2.17; 95% CI, 1.19–3.96) slightly increase the likelihood of a cardiac arrhythmia. Conversely, a known history of panic disorder (LR, 0.26; 95% CI, 0.07–1.01) or having palpitations lasting less than 5 minutes (LR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.22–0.63) makes the diagnosis of cardiac arrhythmia slightly less likely.

### Temporomandibular signs, symptoms, joint alterations and disease activity in juvenile idiopathic arthritis - an observational study [^1152dSHt]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2013). Low credibility.

All consecutive patients who fulfilled the ILAR criteria of JIA and who were referred by physicians or dentists during an eight-year period to one of three specialist dental clinics in Sweden were included. The participating clinics were the Department of Surgical Sciences, Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery in Uppsala, the Orofacial Pain Specialist Clinic in Gothenburg, and the Department of Clinical Oral Physiology at the Eastman Institute in Stockholm. Data were collected from the first examination by the specialist dentist (study visit), which took place between January 1, 1999, and December 31, 2006. Eligible patients had to be born after January 1, 1986, since they were covered by free dental care and therefore more likely to come to examination.

A systematic clinical assessment, according to structured protocols, of orofacial signs was made by a specialist dentist at the study visit. Anamnestic information related to patient-reported symptoms was likewise collected with standardized questions to the patient and/or parents/carers on the same occasion. One dentist (A-L C) read the evaluations by the specialist dentists retrospectively, and Helkimo's indices were calculated on the basis of the clinical and anamnestic data. Helkimo's clinical dysfunction index, Di 0-III, evaluates mandibular mobility, TMJ function, muscle pain, TMJ pain, and pain on movement of the mandible on a three-point scale of increasing severity: 0, 1, or 5. The sum, 0–25 points, constitutes the dysfunction score, which forms the basis of the clinical dysfunction index.

### Temporomandibular disorders in 19-year-old Korean men [^117FhaGs]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence and nature of the relationships between three temporomandibular joint disease (TMD) symptoms and symptoms of associated structures. This study was designed to rule out the effect of the uneven composition of samples on TMD symptoms. Samples were collected from subjects who were of the same age, gender, district, and race. Nineteen-year-old men (n = 27,978) were selected and investigated through questionnaires and clinical examinations. The prevalence of each symptom was studied in order to determine the effects of TMD-associated signs on TMD symptoms. Indices were allocated to reflect the TMD signs and symptoms, and others were dichotomized for bivariate analysis. The predictor variables included headache, neck pain, referred pain, stress, past trauma history in the TMJ, past TMJ dislocation, bruxism, and clenching. The outcome variables included mouth opening limitation, TMJ pain at rest, and TMJ pain during function.

The results indicated that the incidence of masticatory muscle stiffness was 17.8%; TMJ sounds, 14.3%; headache, 7.2%; neck pain, 13.5%; bruxism, 8.4%; and clenching, 9.9%. Stress occurred in 12.8% of participants, past trauma history in 11%, and previous joint dislocation in 2.5%. The experience of dislocation in the TMJ was found to be the most important risk factor for mouth opening limitation (odds ratio, 4.08, P < 0.0001), joint pain during function (odds ratio, 5.50, P < 0.0001), and joint pain at rest (odds ratio, 4.63, P < 0.0001).

### Temporomandibular joint ankylosis in a child: An unusual case with delayed surgical intervention [^1164DceV]. BMC Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) ankylosis is a joint disorder that refers to bone or fibrous adhesion of the anatomic joint components, resulting in loss of function. The etiologies of TMJ ankylosis include previous trauma, previous TMJ surgery, arthritis, and infection. It can be congenital, and in some cases, idiopathic. The most common etiology of TMJ ankylosis is previous trauma, with the second being infection.

Problems associated with TMJ ankylosis in a child include issues with airway maintenance, feeding difficulties, and speech development alterations. Furthermore, it interferes with facial skeletal and dento-alveolar development in the growing child. Severe facial disfigurement can aggravate psychological stress and further decrease the patient's quality of life. Hence, timely diagnosis of TMJ ankylosis, especially in children, and early surgical intervention must be applied to prevent growth alterations.

We present a case of a 7-year-old child with left TMJ ankylosis discovered since infancy. This includes a discussion of the surgery and its complications.

### Current concepts in pediatric temporomandibular joint disorders: Part 1. Etiology, epidemiology, and classification [^113eWmeQ]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Pediatric temporomandibular joint dysfunction, resulting from either soft-tissue or skeletal disorders, may be congenital or acquired. Congenital temporomandibular joint disorders are uncommon. The authors review their experience with pediatric temporomandibular joint disorders and propose a new classification system.

- **Methods**: Clinical records, cephalograms, computed tomographic scans, magnetic resonance images, and pathologic specimens of all pediatric patients (younger than 18 years) with trismus or restricted mandibular excursion from 1976 to 2008 were reviewed. Cases were stratified according to soft-tissue or skeletal pathologic findings; skeletal abnormalities were further characterized as intracapsular or extracapsular.

- **Results**: Thirty-eight patients, ranging in age from 1 day to 18 years at diagnosis, were identified with temporomandibular joint disorders. Ten cases (26.3 percent) were attributable to soft-tissue abnormality. The remaining 28 cases (73.7 percent) were attributable to skeletal abnormality, consisting of 14 congenital and 14 acquired cases (50 percent each). Acquired skeletal deformities included 12 intracapsular ankyloses (85.7 percent) and two extracapsular ankyloses (14.3 percent) (extraarticular bone blocks). Congenital skeletal deformities accounted for five intracapsular ankyloses (35.7 percent) and nine extracapsular ankyloses (64.3 percent).

- **Conclusions**: On initial survey, the data are consistent with published reports that attribute temporomandibular joint dysfunction to acquired abnormality (i.e. trauma and infection).

### Extrapulmonary tuberculosis: Epidemiology and risk factors [^1125T6dd]. Enfermedades Infecciosas y Microbiología Clínica (2011). High credibility.

Extrapulmonary tuberculosis is a disease that can be associated with a wide range of symptoms, including but not limited to seizure, diarrhea, weight loss, hematuria, and dysphagia. It may also present with pleural effusion, focal neurologic deficits, and cough. Other symptoms include a draining sinus tract, amenorrhea, jaundice, altered mental status, palpable mass, abdominal pain, and vomiting. In some cases, cauda equina syndrome, hepatomegaly, limb weakness, pleural friction rub, right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain, and vaginal discharge may occur.

Additional symptoms encompass back stiffness, abdominal distension, night sweats, vision loss, chest pain, inguinal lymphadenopathy, and muscle spasms. Uterine enlargement, suprapubic pain, behavioral or personality changes, dysuria, vaginal bleeding, and fever are also potential manifestations. Other signs include red eyes, pulmonary tuberculosis, menstrual irregularity, muscle atrophy, back pain, ascites, limb paresis, odynophagia, and malaise.

Further complications may involve kyphosis, meningismus, skeletal deformity, cervical lymphadenopathy, nocturia, pericardial effusion, dyspnea, and blurred vision. Some patients may experience reactions to BCG therapy, photophobia, urinary frequency, abdominal lymphadenopathy, and have an immunocompromising condition. Pleuritic chest pain, palpable abdominal mass, HIV infection, scrotal mass, and hoarseness can also be present.

Other characteristics of the disease include cardiomegaly, decreased spinal range of motion (ROM), headache, adnexal mass, urinary urgency, and axillary lymphadenopathy. Splenomegaly, dullness to percussion, epigastric pain, submandibular lymphadenopathy, and pericardial thickening can arise as well. Finally, patients may report flank pain, bone pain, pericardial friction rub, nausea, agitation, floaters and flashes, loss of appetite, supraclavicular lymphadenopathy, and constipation.

### Effects on temporomandibular disorder in the treatment of tension-type headache with acupuncture and therapeutic exercises. A secondary analysis from a randomized controlled trial [^114JjgMk]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2024). High credibility.

Tension-type headache and temporomandibular dysfunction are common coexisting disorders, and the interactions between these two conditions are controversially discussed. In contrast to the present study, Porporatti et al. showed that the presence of a primary headache had a negative effect on temporomandibular dysfunction therapy. Cooper and Kleinberg showed that temporomandibular dysfunction therapy alone led to an improvement of tension-type headache symptoms. Goncalves et al. treated primary headache and temporomandibular dysfunction simultaneously, thus improving baseline findings on both sides. The results of Carlsson et al. are in line with the present results, showing that the treatment of tension-type headache alone, in the presence of coexisting temporomandibular dysfunction symptoms, resulted in an improvement of both syndromes.

Improving temporomandibular joint functions by treating tension-type headache is based on central and peripheral pain modulatory mechanisms. The reduction in pain intensity and its frequency has positive effects on temporomandibular joint function due to the same nociceptive system. Furthermore, the improvement in sleep, the tone-reducing influence on the pericranial muscles, and the optimization of movement behavior in the head/cervical region could be associated with positive functional effects on temporomandibular function.

### Performance of emergency department screening criteria for an early ECG to identify ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction [^112KEv5M]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Despite decades of quality improvement efforts, the timely diagnosis of STEMI patients in the emergency department (ED) presents significant operational challenges. In managing the timely care of patients with STEMI, EDs encounter three distinct types of patients who differ on the screening, diagnosis, and treatment continuum.

- **Prediagnosed patients**: These patients have had an ECG performed and interpreted by another provider. They are usually transferred to an ED or a hospital capable of definitive treatment, most often percutaneous coronary intervention. The expectation is that treatment will be initiated on arrival.

- **Prescreened patients**: These individuals have been evaluated by another provider and referred to the ED with an ECG concerning for ischemia. In these cases, the diagnosis needs to be confirmed with a repeat ECG or reinterpretation of the ECG on arrival. The burden of screening for STEMI from the report of symptoms has already been met in these two scenarios; however, treatment has not been initiated.

- **Undifferentiated symptom patients**: These are the patients at greatest risk of delays in care, as they arrive in the ED with undifferentiated symptoms and are primarily screened by the ED. In these cases, timely STEMI diagnosis is dependent on the patient's condition and symptoms triggering ED intake staff to perform an early ECG.

The ECG is often considered the screening test for STEMI. In the context of emergency care, however, treatment is initiated with ECG evidence of STEMI, making it a diagnostic test. The true screening test is the criteria by which ED care providers initiate an ECG.

### Clinical implications of the innervation of the temporomandibular joint [^116Gyvj2]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

The successful management of temporomandibular joint (TMJ) pain remains elusive. Often, the initial relief of pain is complicated by recurrence of the symptoms. This time frame suggests that the pain may be related to neuromas of the nerves that innervate the TMJ. The study attempted to define the innervation pattern of the TMJ as identified in 16 embalmed and 8 fresh-frozen specimens.

In each specimen, the auriculotemporal nerve, a branch of the mandibular portion (V3) of the trigeminal nerve, was found to innervate the lateral capsule of the TMJ. In 75% of the specimens, the masseteric nerve, a branch of the maxillary portion (V2) of the trigeminal nerve, was found to innervate the anteromedial capsule of the TMJ. In 33% of the specimens, there was a branch coming through the mandibular notch to innervate the anteromedial capsule that was not from the masseteric nerve; this nerve is believed to have passed through the lateral pterygoid muscle after leaving V2.

These consistent patterns of innervation of the TMJ suggest that diagnostic nerve blocks can be performed to determine the pain pathway in these patients. It is suggested that if the nerve blocks are successful, TMJ denervation may be a future method of pain relief in patients with recalcitrant TMJ pain.

### Genome-wide association study for resting electrocardiogram in the Qatari population identifies 6 novel genes and validates novel polygenic risk scores [^117FRNQ7]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). High credibility.

Existing polygenic risk scores (PRSs) performed well in our data set to predict electrocardiogram (ECG) traits. The performance was the best for PR and QTc intervals (R² = 0.053 and R² = 0.059, respectively). Pearson's correlation in our data was larger than in the UK Biobank (UKBB) data set using sparse PRS. For example, in the UKBB study, R² was 0.024 for QTc, 0.022 for QRS, and 0.003 for RR for the PRS-only model, compared with 0.053 for QTc, 0.024 for QRS, and 0.008 for RR in our data. However, in another study using a different method in the UKBB data, the partial correlation for QTc was 0.235 (R² = 0.055), similar to our findings.

The variability in the PRS performance across ancestral groups stresses the need for ancestry-specific PRSs and multiancestry PRSs that can be used effectively across ancestries. The PRSs we developed in our data set using the clumping and thresholding method substantially outperformed existing PRSs for all ECG traits. However, they did not perform well among individuals of European descent from the UKBB. Although we used clumping and thresholding (C+T) to develop our PRS, more sophisticated PRS development methods can be used in future studies in combination with diverse cohorts and have the potential to build better PRSs. Based on our results, Qatari-specific PRSs performed best and should be preferred for disease/trait risk stratification. However, this needs to be validated for other diseases and traits in larger Middle Eastern data sets.

Our heritability and genetic correlation analyses mirrored patterns observed in a previous meta-analysis, such as a negative genetic correlation between JT and QRS. However, our data reveal

### Aural symptoms in patients with temporomandibular joint disorders: Multiple frequency tympanometry provides objective evidence of changes in middle ear impedance [^114LkPWP]. Otology & Neurotology (2010). Low credibility.

The association of temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorders with aural symptoms, such as tinnitus, otic fullness, and subjective decrease of hearing acuity, is a well-established clinical observation. Although several hypotheses have been made about the otic-conductive origin of these complaints, conventional 226-Hz tympanometry has failed to demonstrate any middle ear abnormalities. The aim of this study was to evaluate patients with TMJ disorders using multiple frequency tympanometry (MFT).

This prospective clinical study was conducted in an outpatient clinic, involving 40 patients with unilateral TMJ disorders diagnosed for longer than one month.

After confirming the absence of abnormal otoscopic findings, the interventions included 226-Hz tympanometry, conventional pure-tone audiometry, brainstem auditory evoked potentials, and MFT. The main outcome measure was resonant frequency (RF) values.

Results indicated that, except for MFT, no abnormal audiologic findings were revealed. The ear ipsilateral to the lesion demonstrated significantly higher (p = 0.002) RF values compared to the contralateral ear. This difference in RF values was more pronounced in patients aged 45 years or younger.

The study's findings suggest an increase in the stiffness of the middle ear not detected by conventional tympanometry. This represents the first concrete documentation of minor alterations in the conductive properties of the middle ear and seems to support various hypotheses regarding the middle-ear origin of aural symptoms.

### Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder screening electrocardiograms: A community-based perspective [^115Fxj2w]. Pediatric Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Screening electrocardiograms (EKGs) for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) medication administration is controversial. We reviewed our experience as a community-based cardiology group, examining all ADHD screening EKGs during a 2-year period to determine if they resulted in further consultation and if management was altered. We also evaluated differences between patients already on ADHD medications and those starting ADHD medications, further stratifying the patients into stimulant versus nonstimulant groups.

A total of 691 screening EKGs met our criteria, with forty-two patients (6.1%) recommended for further consultation. EKG findings requiring consultation included left-ventricular hypertrophy, right atrial enlargement, arrhythmia, prolonged QT, and axis deviation. Studies performed during consultation included 39 echocardiograms, 2 stress tests, 2 Holter monitors, and 1 heart card. Five patients (0.72%) were identified to have cardiac disease, one of whom decided against starting ADHD medications due to an arrhythmia, resulting in a change in management (0.14%).

Results comparing mean age, heart rate, and corrected QT interval between patients on medication and patients starting medications were as follows: 10.06 years, 82.87 bpm, and 405.24 ms, compared with 9.99 years, 80.05 bpm, and 405.82 ms, respectively (p = not significant [NS], p = 0.013 [NS], respectively). Results comparing mean age, heart rate, and corrected QT interval between patients on stimulant versus nonstimulant medications were as follows: 9.68 years, 83.10 bpm.

### Is muscle pain in temporomandibular disorder a hyperactivity problem? A clinical, thermographic, and electromyographic analysis [^115KVwyQ]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2024). Low credibility.

This study aimed to report clinical data on muscle pain in temporomandibular disorders using thermography, algometry, and surface electromyography (EMG) to support or rule out the hypothesis that painful muscles are always related to muscular hyperactivity. This cross-sectional, analytical study included 50 participants who underwent clinical examination and evaluation of anterior temporal muscles and bilateral masseters using thermography, algometry, and EMG.

The muscles with greater pain symptoms had hyporadiation and a lower temperature compared with both contralateral muscles and muscles in the asymptomatic group. There was no muscle hyperactivity at rest on EMG analysis; however, there was a greater capacity for muscle recruitment of these symptomatic muscles following a joint decompression test with cotton rolls, suggesting hypoactivity of the affected muscles in the symptomatic patient group. Muscle pain may be related to hypoactivity of the musculature when there is neurological inhibition of the recruitment of muscle fibers, and treatment must consider these neurophysiological alterations.

### Temporomandibular joint arthritis in juvenile idiopathic arthritis, now what [^116HBPR4]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Medical treatment of TMJ arthritis: There is minimal prospective data evaluating the effectiveness of systemic immunosuppressive therapy on TMJ arthritis. Randomized clinical trials of conventional and biologic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs generally have not included the TMJ as an outcome. The only prospective study that did evaluate the effectiveness of systemic medications on the TMJ was published over 30 years ago and included two medications that are no longer used (gold and penicillamine) in the management of children with JIA or related disorders. Evidence that the TMJ might not respond as well to therapies as compared to other joints is observational; for example, a retrospective study showing that of 73 patients with no evidence of arthritis on physical exam, 36 (49%) nevertheless had TMJ arthritis detectable by MRI. Many of these patients were taking traditional and biologic DMARDs. It is unclear why the TMJ would respond less robustly to systemic medications as compared to other joints, as the joint space is physically close to the growth zone of the condylar head, and it is a distinct synovial joint with a unique biochemical makeup. Moreover, there is precedent for observing relative responsiveness to therapy with other joints, for example, the inability of traditional DMARDs to treat axial spondyloarthritis despite some effectiveness with these medications in the management of peripheral disease. There may also be differences in the biology of arthritis in that joint, as an illustration, one study noted similar findings.

### The role of the sympathetic component of the autonomic nervous system on pain before and after third molar extraction- an observational cohort study [^114hteyD]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Low credibility.

In this exploratory study conducted in a healthy young population exposed to a standardized surgical painful condition, we identified a relationship between the sympathetic component of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) and pain, while no effect of the parasympathetic component could be shown. The observed effects, specifically inverse correlations, indicate that the sympathetic response may protect from pain. However, these effects were significant only for the increase in heart rate during the Valsalva maneuver. We must consider this relationship is mild compared to the multiple putative determinants of pain. A limitation of the study is the existence of two surgery subgroups with differences in the anesthetic protocol and NSAID molecule. Nevertheless, other typological differences between these subgroups were mild, and this bias was corrected as the primary outcome was ranked within each subgroup.

The reliability of the ANS explorations and the meaning of our observations must be discussed in light of existing knowledge. While it is currently acknowledged that heart rate variability (HRV) may reflect the ANS, its ability to explore its sympathetic component is debated. Additionally, frequency-domain analyses are considered a better fit for short recordings. HRV measurements in resting conditions reflect the natural balance between the two components of the ANS. Normative data obtained in very similar conditions in young adults fell into ranges similar to those of our observations.

### A self-gating method for time-resolved imaging of nonuniform motion [^1154s7gQ]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to develop a self-gating method capable of assessing nonuniform motion, such as in cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging of patients with severe arrhythmia or for imaging of the temporomandibular joint.

- **Methods**: The proposed method allows for cyclic motion trajectories with a nonuniform pace by replacing the one-dimensional gating signal of conventional image-based self-gating with a two-dimensional gating matrix. The resulting image quality is compared with conventional self-gating and real-time MRI.

- **Results**: Nonuniform self-gating resulted in superior image quality compared with conventional self-gating, and the feasibility study showed significantly improved image sharpness (P < 0.01). Further, improvements in image quality were demonstrated compared with golden angle radial parallel sparse MRI.

- **Conclusion**: A new self-gating method was proposed that allows for cardiovascular magnetic resonance of arrhythmic patients, which is a common problem in clinical practice. Moreover, the proposed method enables self-gated imaging of the temporomandibular joint.

### Temporomandibular joint arthritis in juvenile idiopathic arthritis, now what [^1118XNxc]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Arthritis involving the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) complicates 40–96% of cases of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), potentially leading to devastating changes to form and function. Optimal evaluation and management of this joint remain a matter of ongoing discussion.

- **Methods**: We performed a PubMed search for all articles containing the keywords "temporomandibular" and "arthritis", covering the dates from 2002 through February 28, 2018. A separate PubMed search was conducted for articles with keywords "temporomandibular joint", "arthritis", and "treatment", covering the same dates.

- **Findings**: The TMJ is a particularly challenging joint to assess both clinically and with imaging studies. Clinical assessment of the TMJ is hampered by the low sensitivity of joint pain as well as the absence of physical exam findings early in the disease process. As with all joints, plain radiography and computed tomography only detect arthritic sequelae. Additionally, there is mixed data on the sensitivity of ultrasound, leaving magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as the optimal diagnostic modality. However, several recent studies have shown that non-arthritic children can have subtle findings on MRI consistent with TMJ arthritis, such as joint effusion and contrast enhancement. Consequently, there has been an intense effort to identify features that can be used to differentiate mild TMJ arthritis from normal TMJs, such as the ratio of enhancement within the TMJ itself compared to the enhancement in surrounding musculature.

With respect to the treatment of TMJ arthritis, there is minimal information available.

- **Chest and related pain**: Chest pain, jaw pain, chest pain radiating to the neck or jaw, shoulder pain, chest pain radiating to the left arm, arm pain, chest pain radiating to the back, back pain, left shoulder pain

- **Respiratory and circulatory symptoms**: Dyspnea, bradycardia, hypotension, hypertension, tachycardia, rales, peripheral edema

- **Altered biochemical markers**: Increased CK-MB levels, increased serum troponin I levels, increased serum troponin T levels

- **Gastrointestinal symptoms**: Vomiting, heartburn, nausea, epigastric pain

- **Other symptoms and signs**: Levine's sign, syncope, weakness

- **Lifestyle and health conditions**: Diabetes mellitus, tobacco use, combined oral contraceptive use, obesity, dyslipidemia, metabolic syndrome, cocaine use

Each of these symptoms and conditions can independently or collectively contribute to the presentation of an ST-elevation myocardial infarction.

### Tmj disorders and pain: Assessment by contrast-enhanced MRI [^1127PGSb]. European Journal of Radiology (2009). Low credibility.

Though magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a widely accepted standard for assessing patients with temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorders, efforts to correlate symptoms to MRI findings have often yielded controversial results. The aim of this study was to investigate the correlation between TMJ pain and findings from contrast-enhanced MRI.

Thirty-eight consecutive patients with TMJ dysfunction syndrome (study group) were examined with MRI. The protocol included a T2 turbo spin-echo sequence, a T1 spin-echo sequence, and a T2 gradient-echo sequence (acquired with a closed jaw, at intermediate and maximal opening). The post-contrast phase was obtained through a fat saturation 3D T1 gradient-echo sequence (VIBE).

Post-contrast findings in the study group were matched with those obtained from a control group of 33 patients who underwent MRI of the paranasal sinuses. A statistically significant difference was found between condylar medullary bone enhancement in painful TMJ, painless TMJ, and the control group. Moreover, the average thickness of joint soft tissue enhancement in painful TMJ was greater than in painless TMJ (p < 0.0001) and in the control group.

On multivariate logistic regression analysis, the odds ratio for a painful TMJ to show disk displacement, osteoarthrosis, effusion, and joint soft tissue (JST) enhancement were 3.05, 3.18, 1.2, and 11.36, respectively. Although not histologically proven, TMJ enhancement could reflect the presence of inflammation in painful joints. Furthermore, the administration of contrast could aid in assessing patients with orofacial pain, particularly when clinical exploration is insufficient.

### SPL drug information for revumenib [^115AgUEK]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Warning or precaution regarding the use of revumenib PO (also known as Revuforj) and prolonged QT interval: maintain a high level of suspicion, as revumenib can cause QT prolongation. Obtain a baseline ECG and do not initiate treatment if QTc > 450 msec. Monitor ECG weekly for the first 4 weeks, then monthly, with more frequent monitoring in patients with congenital long QT syndrome, heart failure (HF), electrolyte abnormalities, or concurrent use of QT-prolonging agents.

- **Treatment interruption and resumption**: Interrupt revumenib if QTc increases to 480–500 msec and resume at the same dose once QTc returns to ≤ 480 msec. Interrupt if QTc > 500 msec or increases by > 60 msec from baseline, and restart at a lower dose after QTc normalizes to ≤ 480 msec.

- **Dosing adjustments based on weight**:
	- For patients weighing ≥ 40 kg, restart at 160 mg BID (110 mg BID with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors).
	- For patients weighing < 40 kg, restart at 95 mg/m² BID (65 mg/m² BID with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors).

Permanently discontinue revumenib in cases of ventricular arrhythmias or QTc prolongation with life-threatening arrhythmia symptoms.

### Inferior or double joint spaces injection versus superior joint space injection for temporomandibular disorders: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^111Cve9Q]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to compare the effect and safety of inferior or double temporomandibular joint spaces drug injection versus superior temporomandibular joint space injection in the treatment of temporomandibular disorders.

- **Materials and methods**: MEDLINE (via Ovid, 1948 to March 2011), CENTRAL (Issue 1, 2011), Embase (1984 to March 2011), CBM (1978 to March 2011), and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform were searched electronically. Relevant journals and references of included studies were hand-searched for randomized controlled trials comparing the effect or safety of inferior or double joint spaces drug injection technique with that of the superior space injection technique. Risk of bias assessment with the tool recommended by Cochrane Collaboration, reporting quality assessment with CONSORT, and data extraction were carried out independently by two reviewers. Meta-analysis was conducted using RevMan 5.0.23.

- **Results**: Four trials with 349 participants were included. All included studies had a moderate risk of bias. Meta-analysis showed that the inferior or double spaces injection technique could significantly increase maximal mouth opening by 2.88 mm (P = .0001) and alleviate pain intensity in the temporomandibular area on average by 9.01 mm on visual analog scale scores (P = .0001) compared with the superior space injection technique. However, it did not markedly change the synthesized clinical index in the short term (P = .05). Nevertheless, there were more beneficial outcomes in terms of maximal mouth opening (P = .002) and pain relief (P < .0001) with the inferior or double spaces injection technique.

### The association between research diagnostic criteria for temporomandibular disorder findings and biting force and endurance in patients with temporomandibular disorders [^111MYRbA]. Pain Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

This study was designed to evaluate the association between examination findings based on research diagnostic criteria for temporomandibular disorders and performances on bite force and endurance tasks.

- **Methods**: Subjects were 126 patients with temporomandibular disorder and 34 pain-free controls. A subset of patients with temporomandibular disorder (n = 56) also were evaluated following a brief conservative 4-week treatment intervention.

- **Results**: A multivariate analysis of variance indicated that female patients (P < .001) but not males (P = .17) had lower bite forces than age- and gender-matched controls. Dental examination findings were significantly but modestly predictive of bite task performance (R² = 0.175), with higher joint pain and smaller maximum unassisted jaw opening associated with lower bite force. The brief treatment interventions resulted in both self-reported and clinically determined improvements. Clinical and self-reported improvement significantly predicted pre-post treatment changes in biting force among female subjects (R² = 0.237). Specifically, reduction in joint palpation pain and self-reported pain (McGill Pain Questionnaire short form) were the primary predictors of increases in bite force. The improvement in biting force was modest (mean = 7 lb), and the force levels of female patients remained lower than those of control subjects. Treatment did not significantly increase endurance time.

- **Discussion**: The brief conservative treatments used resulted in improvements in pain and jaw opening, and 81.8% of patients reported moderate to major improvement.

No clinically meaningful changes in ECG parameters from baseline to final visit were observed for patients in controlled studies.

- **Other reactions observed during the premarketing evaluation of Emsam**: The following listing does not include reactions that are: 1) already listed elsewhere in labeling, 2) for which a causal relationship to the drug was remote, 3) so general as to be uninformative, 4) not considered to have significant clinical implications, or 5) occurred at a rate equal to or less than placebo.

	- **Cardiovascular system**: Tachycardia.
	- **Digestive system**: Anorexia.
	- **Nervous system**: Agitation, amnesia, tremor, twitching.
	- **Skin and appendages**: Pruritus.

- **Postmarketing experience**: The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of Emsam. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

	- **Nervous system**: Convulsion and hypoesthesia.
	- **Psychiatric system**: Disorientation, hallucination (visual), and tension.

Temporomandibular disorders (TMD) are a heterogeneous group of musculoskeletal and neuromuscular conditions involving the temporomandibular joint complex, as well as surrounding musculature and osseous components. TMD affects up to 15% of adults, with a peak incidence at 20 to 40 years of age. TMD is classified as intra-articular or extra-articular. Common symptoms include jaw pain or dysfunction, earache, headache, and facial pain. The etiology of TMD is multifactorial, encompassing biologic, environmental, social, emotional, and cognitive triggers.

Diagnosis is most often based on history and physical examination. Diagnostic imaging may be beneficial when malocclusion or intra-articular abnormalities are suspected. Most patients improve with a combination of noninvasive therapies, including patient education, self-care, cognitive behavior therapy, pharmacotherapy, physical therapy, and occlusal devices. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and muscle relaxants are recommended initially, and benzodiazepines or antidepressants may be added for chronic cases. Referral to an oral and maxillofacial surgeon is indicated for refractory cases.

### Accurate automatic detection of electrode interchange in the electrocardiogram [^111XHM3e]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2001). Low credibility.

In recording an electrocardiogram (ECG), an interchange of electrodes may easily go unnoticed. Automatic detection would be desirable; however, algorithms dealing with more than left arm-right arm reversal have moderate sensitivity. We propose a novel approach that leverages the redundancy of information in the standard 12-lead ECG. We assume that each of the eight independent electrocardiographic leads can be reconstructed from the seven others with reasonable approximation. The correlation between any electrocardiographic lead and its reconstruction should be higher if the electrodes are correctly placed than when some interchange is present. The difference in correlation should have discriminative power. This was verified on a set of 3,305 ECGs for 14 common electrode interchange errors. The material was split into a learning and test set, and general reconstruction coefficients were computed from the learning set.

For each interchange, electrode-error ECGs were derived by rearranging leads of the unaltered ECGs. Correlations between the actual leads and their reconstructions were computed for all ECGs. From the differences in lead correlation, decision rules were derived for each kind of interchange. All 14 rules had specificities of ≥ 99.5% in the test set. Sensitivities were ≥ 93% for 11 rules, although left arm-left leg electrode reversal scored low.

### Management of orofacial manifestations of juvenile idiopathic arthritis: Interdisciplinary consensus-based recommendations [^111tcjQw]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2023). Low credibility.

Timely diagnosis is a critical first step in the management of TMJ arthritis and the related orofacial manifestations. Monitoring orofacial health in patients with TMJ involvement requires a standardized approach. No method of assessment can stand alone. Optimal TMJ monitoring should involve multiple modalities of assessment, including different aspects of patient history and clinical examination, patient-reported outcomes, and imaging and radiology. Recommendations 1–4 (see below) refer to the diagnosis of TMJ arthritis and longitudinal monitoring of orofacial health.

- **Recommendation 1**: Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is currently the best method to detect active TMJ arthritis (LoE 2, mean ± SD SoR 8.4 ± 2.1). This recommendation specifies "active" TMJ inflammation to differentiate from TMJ involvement without active inflammation. The use of JIA-specific TMJ MRI protocols and scoring systems is recommended. It is recognized that the interpretation of MRI findings has an element of subjectivity and is influenced by the technique and equipment used for image capture, as well as by the expertise of the reader. Additional standardization of both image acquisition and interpretation is needed. It is stressed that the presence of a small amount of TMJ fluid and/or minor contrast enhancement may be considered a normal variation in a healthy TMJ, rather than a sign of active TMJ arthritis.

Ultrasonography is operator-dependent and appears to have limited sensitivity to detect TMJ inflammation in patients with JIA.

### Temporomandibular joint involvement in juvenile idiopathic arthritis: Reliability and validity of a screening protocol for the rheumatologist [^116GXtH6]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Clinical considerations

Because the screening protocol for TMJ involvement is applicable in standard clinical care, it provides the rheumatologist with systematic and focused TMJ information, which relates to the JIA disease activity (JADAS-27). It is a tool to detect signs and symptoms of dysfunction of the masticatory system. Diagnosing TMJ arthritis is not possible with clinical assessment only, as indeed it can exist in the absence of signs and symptoms.

In order to diagnose arthritis as early as possible, we investigated the correlation between the protocol score and inflammatory activity. Ideally, TMJ arthritis should be detected with 100 percent certainty, and this goal is approached by MRI. Measuring disease activity as a leading variable for management decisions is another option and is feasible and appropriate in clinical practice. A positive correlation between the protocol score and the JADAS-27 offers additional support for the protocol to be used at regular intervals for identifying disease activity in the TMJ.

It is probable that MRI with contrast detects more TMJ inflammation than the screening protocol detects TMJ dysfunction. Nevertheless, the clinical significance of MRI contrast enhancement is not completely known, as suggested by a recent study in which TMJ MRI enhancement is compatible with a normal range of mouth opening, normal TMJ function, absence of arthritis in other joints, and may be present in the context of immunosuppressive therapy. The correlation of findings resulting from the protocol and MRI findings (and eventually other mandibular…

### Effects on temporomandibular disorder in the treatment of tension-type headache with acupuncture and therapeutic exercises. A secondary analysis from a randomized controlled trial [^114Qz6NF]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2024). High credibility.

In addition to drug therapy strategies, frequent tension-type headache can be treated with non-drug methods such as acupuncture and physiotherapeutic exercise. Acupuncture used alone or in combination with physiotherapeutic exercise reduces pain significantly and has positive effects on depression, anxiety, and quality of life. Acupuncture can induce analgesic effects by activating various pain inhibitory control systems, while therapeutic exercise may have an additional regulatory effect on the autonomic nervous system. It is also associated with positive neuroplastic changes. Therefore, an additive effect on chronic pain conditions from combined acupuncture and therapeutic exercise applications can be assumed.

A close relationship between the head and the temporomandibular joint can be suspected based on anatomical and functional relationships and symptomatology similarities. A temporomandibular disorder manifests clinically as local and regional pain in the head and neck area. From the perspective of dentistry, various occlusal disorders are etiologically linked to the development of temporomandibular dysfunction. Both diseases affect the same nociceptive system and utilize trigeminocervical structures involved in central pain modulation. Temporomandibular dysfunction is discussed as a possible trigger factor for the manifestation of tension-type headache, as well as a predictor of its chronicity. The coincidence of tension headache and temporomandibular dysfunction is recognized in the literature, and a multi-professional approach is recommended.

### Bradycardia and asystole during temporomandibular joint reconstruction [^116L1d38]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2020). Low credibility.

Anesthesia providers are familiar with the oculocardiac reflex, which is one type of trigeminocardiac reflex. While less common, arrhythmias associated with manipulation of other trigeminal nerve branches can occur. We report the presentation and management of bradycardia and asystole resulting from stimulation of the mandibular branch of the trigeminal nerve during temporomandibular joint reconstruction.

### Diagnostic accuracy of clinical tests and signs of temporomandibular joint disorders: a systematic review of the literature [^1161XVfR]. Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2011). Low credibility.

This systematic review aims to summarize the research on the accuracy of individual clinical diagnostic signs and tests for the presence of temporomandibular disorder (TMD), including the subclassifications affiliated with TMD. Diagnosis of TMD through clinical diagnostic measures has been reported in many studies. However, few of these studies have identified individual clinical tests or signs that can aid in the diagnosis of TMD or differentiate between its subclassifications.

Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed. Computerized and hand searches were conducted to locate articles on the diagnostic accuracy of clinical tests and signs. To be considered for review, studies required:

1. An assessment of individual clinical measures of TMD.
2. A report of the diagnostic accuracy of these measures.
3. An acceptable reference standard for comparison.

Quality assessment of studies of diagnostic accuracy (QUADAS) scores were completed for each selected article. Sensitivity, specificity, and negative and positive likelihood ratios were calculated for each diagnostic test described.

The search strategy identified 131 potential articles, narrowed down to 7 that met the criteria for this review. After assessment using the QUADAS score, 3 of these articles were of high quality. All 7 studies used tests to differentiate subclassifications of TMD. The studies covered diagnostic tests/signs of joint sounds and joint movements.

### Electrocardiograms of menopausal women with coronary heart disease or at increased risk for its occurrence [^1136V97v]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2010). Low credibility.

Little is known about the electrocardiographic (ECG) characteristics of menopausal women with or at increased risk of coronary heart disease (CHD). Data from 10,101 participants in the Raloxifene Use for The Heart (RUTH) trial were used to correlate baseline ECG abnormalities with clinical characteristics. Baseline characteristics that were statistically significantly associated (p ≤ 0.05) with ECG findings in univariate analyses were used to derive multivariate model selection.

Of the women, 59% had normal electrocardiograms, with 50% from women with CHD and 69% from women at increased risk of CHD. Among the women with CHD, 59% reported a previous myocardial infarction (MI); 43% had a normal electrocardiogram, and 49% had a definite ECG Q-wave MI. Women in the increased-risk group had not reported a previous MI, yet 11% had a definite ECG Q-wave MI. Of the women reporting hypertension, 35% had ECG evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy, but 58% did not have an abnormal electrocardiogram. Significantly more women with diabetes in the increased-risk and documented CHD cohorts had abnormal electrocardiograms (p < 0.01 for the two cohorts). The percentage of abnormal electrocardiograms increased with increasing age (55 to 64, 65 to 74, and ≥ 75 years, p < 0.01) in all cohorts. Angina and coronary artery bypass graft surgery, but not percutaneous coronary intervention, predicted an abnormal electrocardiogram.

In conclusion, there were high percentages of normal electrocardiograms in the increased-risk and documented CHD groups of RUTH participants, with substantial discrepancy between MI history and ECG MI documentation.

### Pantoprazole sodium [^116GS3m9]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Reproduction studies in animals have shown that intravenous pantoprazole doses up to 20 mg/kg/day in rats (4 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area) and up to 15 mg/kg/day in rabbits (6 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area) during organogenesis did not impair fertility or harm fetuses due to pantoprazole.

A pre-and post-natal development toxicity study in rats was conducted with pantoprazole sodium, focusing on effects on bone development. Pregnant females were given oral doses of 5, 15, and 30 mg/kg/day (approximately 1, 3, and 6 times the human dose of 40 mg/day on a body surface area basis) from gestation day 6 through lactation day 21. Pups received the same doses orally from postnatal day 4 through 21 (approximately 1, 2.3, and 3.2 times the exposure (AUC) in humans at a dose of 40 mg). The study found no drug-related findings in maternal animals. However, during the preweaning dosing phase (postnatal day 4 to 21), increased mortality and/or moribundity with decreased body weight and weight gain were observed at doses starting from 5 mg/kg/day (approximately equal exposures (AUC) in humans receiving the 40 mg dose) and higher. By postnatal day 21, reductions in mean femur length and weight, along with alterations in femur bone mass and geometry, were observed in the offspring at 5 mg/kg/day (approximately equal exposures (AUC) in humans at the 40 mg dose).

### Investigation of temporomandibular dysfunction in patients with breast cancer-related lymphedema [^112FeYWn]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2025). Low credibility.

It was hypothesized that postural disorders and neck and shoulder problems seen in breast cancer survivors may cause TMJ involvement in this patient group. Psychological effects are known to cause muscle pain by increasing muscle tone and TMD, along with changes in mandibular position. However, to the best of our knowledge, no study examining TMD in patients with breast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL) was found in the literature. Given that TMD and breast cancer frequently occur in women of comparable ages, it was thought that the potential for TMD in patients diagnosed with breast cancer should be investigated. The aim of this study was to examine TMD in patients with BCRL.

The secondary aim of the study was to investigate the effects of posture, neck and shoulder ROM, psychological status, and LE severity on TMD severity in BCRL patients.

### Friedreich's SIGN [^115txFFj]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

An 82-year-old man with chronic atrial fibrillation treated with anticoagulation was admitted to the hospital for subacute progressive exertional dyspnoea. On examination, the jugular venous waveform was elevated to the mandibular angle with the patient sitting upright. Heart sounds were muffled. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) revealed a large circumferential pericardial effusion with early tamponade physiology. Pericardiocentesis yielded a large volume of sanguineous fluid. Following the procedure, there was an improvement in jugular venous pressure to 14 cm H2O.

With inspiration, the height of the waveform increased (Kussmaul's sign), and there was a prominent y descent, known as Friedreich's sign (see video 1). Repeat TTE revealed a thickened pericardium, early diastolic septal bounce, and respirophasic changes in early diastolic filling consistent with constrictive pericardial physiology.

Friedreich's sign is a physical finding of constrictive pericarditis. The normal jugular venous waveform contains two descents, x and y. The x descent, which corresponds to the combination of right atrial relaxation and depression of the atrial floor during ventricular contraction, is normally dominant. The y descent occurs as a result of passive ventricular filling during early diastole and is usually absent in patients with tamponade. In constrictive pericarditis, the characteristic sharp and deep y descent reflects rapid filling in early diastole, which occurs when the unyielding pericardium elevates atrial pressure and limits ventricular filling to the early diastolic phase.

### The role of facial trauma as a possible etiologic factor in temporomandibular joint disorder [^117WB5aY]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Facial trauma has been suggested as a possible etiologic factor of temporomandibular joint disorder. However, there is little information on the role of macrotrauma. The main purpose of this study was to validate facial trauma as a potential etiologic factor for temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorder. Multidirectional approaches were applied for the evaluation of changes in the TMJ after macrotrauma.

Analysis of TMJ status, including arthroscopic examination, histomorphologic examination, and synovial fluid biochemical analysis, was performed on patients with mandibular fractures. Additionally, the efficacy of arthrocentesis for these patients was evaluated from a functional point of view.

In arthroscopic examinations, evidence of synovitis with varying degrees was found, with representative findings of fibrillation and ecchymosis. On histomorphologic examination, observations included bloody smear, degenerated cells and cartilage, inflammatory cells, and crystal presence. Biochemical analysis of the synovial fluid revealed considerable amounts of prostaglandin E(2) and leukotriene B(4).

The inflammatory and degenerative changes of the TMJ can develop after facial trauma. Trauma can be a possible etiologic factor in cartilage degeneration, as well as in biochemical and intra-articular pathology. Clinicians should recognize the etiologic importance of macrotrauma and consider long-term evaluation of the TMJ, along with adequate treatment for patients with facial trauma.

### Clinical practice guidelines for the care of girls and women with Turner syndrome [^111HJ7oJ]. European Journal of Endocrinology (2024). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for Turner syndrome, specifically concerning ECG, the ESE/PES 2024 guidelines recommend following standard guidelines for the general population. This applies to patients with Turner syndrome if a QTc prolongation greater than 480 ms, determined by Hodges formula, has been detected on at least two serial ECGs. Consultation with a cardiologist, possibly an electrophysiologist, is advised.

### Are signs of temporomandibular disorders stable and predictable in adolescents with headache [^1124Uhex]. Cephalalgia (2008). Low credibility.

The aim of the present study was to investigate changes in the signs and symptoms of temporomandibular disorders (TMD) and the factors predicting TMD signs in adolescents with and without headache. A population-based sample of 13-year-olds (n = 212) with and without headache was re-examined at the age of 16. The study included a questionnaire, face-to-face interview, and somatic examination. In addition, neurological, muscle, and stomatognathic examinations were performed. Significant changes were observed in TMD signs during the follow-up; however, TMD signs at the conclusion of the follow-up could not be predicted by baseline headache, sleeping difficulties, depression, or muscle pain. TMD signs at the age of 16 were associated with female gender and muscle pain. We conclude that considerable changes in TMD signs occur during the follow-up of adolescents with and without headache. Headache-related TMD are not predictable in adolescents with and without headache.

### 2022 ESC guidelines for the management of patients with ventricular arrhythmias and the prevention of sudden cardiac death [^116PkZMS]. European Heart Journal (2022). High credibility.

For patients with ventricular arrhythmias, particularly those with myocarditis, the 2022 ESC guidelines recommend considering catheter ablation as an alternative to ICD therapy. This decision should be made following a thorough discussion with the patient and should be considered in cases where established endpoints have been reached. This approach is advised for patients experiencing hemodynamically well-tolerated sustained monomorphic VT during the chronic phase of myocarditis, with preserved LV function and a limited scar that is amenable to ablation.

### Genome-wide association reveals contribution of MRAS to painful temporomandibular disorder in males [^117L9Zpm]. Pain (2019). Low credibility.

**Case classification**: The classification of temporomandibular disorder (TMD) was based on the research diagnostic criteria for TMD (RDC/TMD). Cases met all three of the following criteria: (1) pain in the cheeks, jaw muscles, temples, or jaw joints occurring for at least five days per month during the preceding six months, including at least 15 days in the month before enrollment; (2) pain reported in the examiner-defined orofacial region for at least five days out of the prior 30 days; and (3) pain evoked by palpation of the orofacial muscles or maneuver of the jaw in at least three masticatory muscles, one temporomandibular joint, or both. Examiners were trained in standardized procedures used during the examination, and the annual evaluation of interexaminer reliability revealed consistently excellent levels of examiner agreement (kappa > 0.75).

### Arthrocentesis procedure: using this therapeutic maneuver for TMJ closed lock management [^112Lzh4x]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorder is a term that encompasses a number of overlapping conditions, such as closed lock. Closed lock of the TMJ is considered a consequence of a nonreducing deformed disc acting as an obstacle to the sliding condylar head, usually causing a decrease in maximum mouth opening and acute pain. The management of the TMJ is still controversial. Thus, arthrocentesis of the TMJ is a valuable modification of the traditional method of arthroscopic lavage. It involves washing the joint to remove chemical inflammatory mediators and intra-articular adhesions, thereby changing intra-articular pressure. TMJ disorder has always presented a therapeutic challenge to maxillofacial surgeons. Therefore, this paper aimed to describe a clinical report of a closed lock of the left TMJ in a 19-year-old female subject who was successfully treated by the arthrocentesis procedure.

### Imaging of the temporomandibular joint [^111B6WKc]. Clinical Radiology (2021). Low credibility.

Temporomandibular disorders are common, especially in young to middle-aged women, and most settle with supportive treatment. Imaging is indicated for the small percentage of cases that do not respond to conservative management and when the diagnosis is in doubt. The temporomandibular joint (TMJ) is a bilateral synovial articulation between the mandible and skull base. It has an intra-articular disc dividing the joint into superior and inferior compartments, and the articular surfaces are lined with fibrocartilage.

The normal imaging anatomy of the TMJ is described and illustrated. Different movements occur in each joint compartment: a hinge movement in the inferior joint space and translation or gliding in the superior joint space. Internal derangement is the most common disorder affecting the TMJ and is most commonly due to disc displacement, followed by osteoarthritis and inflammatory arthritides. The imaging findings, primarily on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT), of internal derangement and less common disorders of the joint are reviewed and illustrated. Optimal imaging protocols are discussed with detailed reporting guidelines.
