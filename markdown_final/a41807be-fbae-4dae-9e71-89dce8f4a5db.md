## Question

can tramadol be used in cirrhosis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether tramadol can be used in patients with cirrhosis, and if so, how to dose it safely and when to avoid it. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the hepatic impairment severity using Child-Pugh classification. Then, I should verify the pharmacokinetic changes in cirrhosis and how they alter tramadol and M1 exposure. Next, I will check immediate-release versus extended-release formulations and their specific restrictions. After that, I should review major risks in cirrhosis such as hepatic encephalopathy, seizures, and drug–drug interactions. Then, I will reconcile FDA labeling with society guidance. Finally, I will outline practical dosing recommendations and safer alternatives if tramadol is not appropriate, before synthesizing a concise recommendation.

> Let me first confirm the clinical stratification, because everything hinges on it: I need to classify the hepatic impairment into Child-Pugh A, B, or C, as this will determine whether dose reduction is needed and whether extended-release formulations are contraindicated [^113Nd3ia] [^111qFdut].

> Now, I will examine pharmacokinetics in cirrhosis to ensure I am not underestimating exposure changes. Tramadol is metabolized to M1 via CYP2D6 and undergoes hepatic N-demethylation and conjugation, and in advanced cirrhosis both tramadol and M1 show markedly prolonged half-lives and higher AUCs, meaning accumulation and delayed steady-state are real concerns, so I should be cautious even with seemingly modest doses [^1129kvTK] [^111qFdut] [^116NHccT].

> Hold on, I should verify formulation-specific restrictions before considering dosing: extended-release tramadol is not studied in hepatic impairment and lacks the dosing flexibility needed in cirrhosis, so FDA labeling advises avoiding tramadol ER in hepatic impairment. In contrast, immediate-release tramadol can be used with caution and dose adjustment in severe impairment, typically max 50 mg per dose with prolonged intervals, and often a starting dose as low as 25 mg with very conservative titration in Child-Pugh C [^111qFdut] [^116W9SLN] [^113Nd3ia].

> Wait, let me verify something I almost misstated: I initially thought the maximum dose in severe hepatic impairment was 50 mg every 6 hours. But I should correct that to a maximum of 50 mg per dose with markedly extended intervals, for example every 12 hours, reflecting prolonged half-lives and the risk of accumulation, with some guidance recommending no more than 200 mg per day total in renal and hepatic dysfunction contexts and slow titration every few days if at all [^112jwbSD] [^1129kvTK] [^114mMLZB].

> Next, I should review risks that are amplified in cirrhosis. I need to ensure I am not missing encephalopathy risk, which opioids including tramadol can precipitate through slowed gut transit and increased ammonia absorption, so constipation prophylaxis with lactulose or polyethylene glycol is essential and sedatives should be minimized. Additionally, tramadol lowers seizure threshold and carries serotonin toxicity risk, both of which are harder to manage in decompensated disease, and its variable CYP2D6 metabolism makes effects unpredictable in liver disease [^1118N8rf] [^112tGHz1] [^114cxRAs] [^115izFV7].

> I will now examine the FDA label versus society guidance, because there is apparent tension. FDA labeling permits immediate-release tramadol in Child-Pugh A/B without adjustment and allows a reduced dose in Child-Pugh C, but hepatology guidance generally advises avoiding tramadol in cirrhosis when possible due to unpredictable pharmacokinetics and adverse effects, preferring low-dose oxycodone or hydromorphone if opioids are needed. Reconciling this, I should say tramadol may be considered only when alternatives are inadequate, at the lowest effective dose, with close monitoring, and generally favor short-acting agents to allow rapid titration and discontinuation if adverse effects emerge [^113Nd3ia] [^1118N8rf] [^112TA27V] [^112jwbSD].

> But wait, what if the pain is neuropathic or nociplastic? I should double-check whether tramadol adds benefit there. Evidence in cirrhosis is limited, and for neuropathic pain gabapentin or pregabalin are preferred first-line, while for nociceptive pain acetaminophen up to 2 g/day is the foundation and systemic NSAIDs should be avoided. Tramadol's role, if any, is as a cautious, second-line, short-term option for refractory mixed pain, with attention to encephalopathy prevention and fall risk mitigation [^112TA27V] [^112kknEF] [^111nkKXt] [^112tGHz1].

> I need to ensure practical safety steps are explicit: start at 25 mg for opioid-naïve patients, extend intervals to every 12 hours in severe hepatic impairment, avoid CNS depressants and serotonergic co-therapy when possible, and reassess frequently for drowsiness, confusion, asterixis, and constipation. In any decompensated state or active hepatic encephalopathy, I should avoid tramadol altogether and prioritize nonpharmacologic strategies and local therapies like lidocaine patches or topical NSAIDs for localized pain [^112jwbSD] [^112TA27V] [^112kknEF].

> Final synthesis: Yes, tramadol can be used in cirrhosis, but only with great caution, in select circumstances, and with strict attention to Child-Pugh class. Immediate-release tramadol is acceptable without adjustment in Child-Pugh A/B, whereas in Child-Pugh C it should be reduced to a maximum of 50 mg per dose with extended intervals, and extended-release formulations should be avoided. Given society guidance and cirrhosis-specific risks, tramadol is not a first-choice agent and should be reserved for short-term use when alternatives are inadequate, with vigilant monitoring for encephalopathy, seizures, and drug interactions [^113Nd3ia] [^111qFdut] [^1118N8rf] [^112TA27V].

---

Tramadol can be used in cirrhosis with **cautious dose adjustment** and close monitoring, but it is not first-line due to risks of hepatic encephalopathy, respiratory depression, and serotonin syndrome [^1118N8rf] [^112TA27V]. For Child-Pugh A/B, use the lowest effective dose and extend intervals; for Child-Pugh C, **avoid tramadol** if possible, or limit to 50 mg once daily with close monitoring [^113Nd3ia] [^115QkuD8]. Prefer acetaminophen (≤ 2 g/day) or topical NSAIDs [^113v4r41]; if an opioid is needed, use low-dose oxycodone or hydromorphone with extended intervals [^112TA27V]. Monitor for sedation, confusion, constipation, and respiratory depression, and avoid serotonergic or CNS depressant co-medications [^116W9SLN].

---

## Pharmacokinetics of tramadol in cirrhosis

In cirrhosis, **reduced hepatic metabolism** increases tramadol exposure and prolongs half-life, raising toxicity risk [^1129kvTK] [^111qFdut]. Immediate-release tramadol shows increased AUC and prolonged half-life in advanced cirrhosis; extended-release formulations are not recommended in hepatic impairment due to limited dosing flexibility and accumulation risk [^111qFdut].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

| **Severity of hepatic impairment** | **Recommendation for tramadol use** |
|-|-|
| Child-Pugh A (mild) | Use with caution; no dose adjustment required, but monitor closely [^113Nd3ia] |
| Child-Pugh B (moderate) | Use with caution; no dose adjustment required, but monitor closely [^113Nd3ia] |
| Child-Pugh C (severe) | Avoid if possible; if absolutely necessary, limit to 50 mg once daily with close monitoring [^113Nd3ia] [^1118N8rf] |

## Risks and adverse effects in cirrhosis

Tramadol use in cirrhosis carries **significant risks**:

- **Hepatic encephalopathy**: Opioids, including tramadol, can precipitate or worsen encephalopathy via prolonged transit and increased ammonia absorption [^112tGHz1] [^113HKWnn].

- **Respiratory depression**: Higher risk in cirrhosis due to altered pharmacokinetics and CNS sensitivity [^113HKWnn] [^111qFdut].

- **Serotonin syndrome**: Risk increases with serotonergic drugs (SSRIs, SNRIs, TCAs) [^112jwbSD].

- **Seizures**: Lowered seizure threshold, especially with high doses or interacting drugs [^114i9PJZ].

---

## Alternative analgesic options

Given these risks, **consider alternatives**:

- **Acetaminophen**: Preferred first-line; ≤ 2 g/day in cirrhosis [^112TA27V].

- **Topical NSAIDs**: Diclofenac gel for localized pain with minimal systemic absorption [^notfound].

- **Gabapentin or pregabalin**: For neuropathic pain; start low and titrate cautiously [^113v4r41].

- **Low-dose oxycodone or hydromorphone**: If opioids are needed, use short-acting agents with extended intervals and close monitoring [^112TA27V] [^111Bf8wx].

---

## Monitoring and precautions

If tramadol is used in cirrhosis, **monitor for**:

- Sedation, confusion, and signs of hepatic encephalopathy [^113HKWnn].

- Respiratory depression, especially with CNS depressants or benzodiazepines [^116W9SLN].

- Constipation and opioid-induced hyperalgesia [^11194ZDM].

- Drug interactions via CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 pathways [^113ZbNQP].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Child-Pugh A/B**: Use tramadol cautiously with the lowest effective dose and extended intervals; monitor closely [^112jwbSD].

- **Child-Pugh C**: Avoid tramadol if possible; if necessary, limit to 50 mg once daily with close monitoring [^113Nd3ia].

- **Prefer alternatives**: Acetaminophen, topical NSAIDs, gabapentinoids, or low-dose oxycodone/hydromorphone if opioids are required [^113v4r41].

- **Monitor**: Watch for encephalopathy, respiratory depression, serotonin syndrome, and drug interactions [^113HKWnn].

---

Tramadol is not first-line in cirrhosis due to altered metabolism and significant risks; if used, apply strict dose limits, extended intervals, and close monitoring, and **prefer safer alternatives** whenever possible [^1118N8rf].

Interactions with Drugs Affecting Cytochrome P450 Isoenzymes

The effects of concomitant use or discontinuation of cytochrome P450 3A4 inducers, 3A4 inhibitors, or 2D6 inhibitors with tramadol are complex. Use of cytochrome P450 3A4 inducers, 3A4 inhibitors, or 2D6 inhibitors with tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets requires careful consideration of the effects on the parent drug, tramadol, and the active metabolite, M1 [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7), Drug Interactions (7)].

Hepatotoxicity

Tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets contain tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen. Acetaminophen has been associated with cases of acute liver failure, at times resulting in liver transplant and death. Most of the cases of liver injury are associated with the use of acetaminophen at doses that exceed 4,000 milligrams per day, and often involve more than one acetaminophen-containing product [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)].

WARNING: SERIOUS AND LIFE-THREATENING RISKS FROM USE OF TRAMADOL HYDROCHLORIDE AND ACETAMINOPHEN TABLETS

See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning.

Tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets exposes users to the risks of addiction, abuse and misuse, which can lead to overdose and death. Assess each patient's risk prior to prescribing tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets, and monitor regularly for these behaviors or conditions. (5.1)
Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression may occur. Monitor closely, especially during initiation or following a dose increase. (5.2)
Accidental ingestion of tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets, especially by children, can result in a fatal overdose of tramadol. (5.2)
Concomitant use of opioids with benzodiazepines or other central nervous system (CNS) depressants, including alcohol, may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Reserve concomitant prescribing for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate; limit dosages and durations to the minimum required; and follow patients for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. (5.3, 7)
Advise pregnant women using opioids for an extended period of time of the risk of Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome, which may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated. Ensure that management by neonatology experts will be available at delivery. (5.4)
To ensure that the benefits of opioid analgesics outweigh the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has required a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) for these products. (5.5)
Life-threatening respiratory depression and death have occurred in children who received tramadol. Some of the reported cases followed tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy; in at least one case, the child had evidence of being an ultra-rapid metabolizer of tramadol due to a CYP2D6 polymorphism (5.6). Tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets is contraindicated in children younger than 12 years of age and in children younger than 18 years of age following tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy (4). Avoid the use of tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets in adolescents 12 to 18 years of age who have other risk factors that may increase their sensitivity to the respiratory depressant effects of tramadol. (5.6)
The effects of concomitant use or discontinuation of cytochrome P450 3A4 inducers, 3A4 inhibitors, or 2D6 inhibitors with tramadol are complex. Use of cytochrome P450 3A4 inducers, 3A4 inhibitors, or 2D6 inhibitors with tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets requires careful consideration of the effects on the parent drug, tramadol, and the active metabolite, M1. (5.7, 7)
Tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets contains acetaminophen. Acetaminophen has been associated with cases of acute liver failure, at times resulting in liver transplant and death. Most of the cases of liver injury are associated with the use of acetaminophen at doses that exceed 4,000 milligrams per day, and often involve more than one acetaminophen containing product. (5.9)

FIGURE 1
Adverse outcomes associated with chronic pain in patients with cirrhosis. Chronic pain, including nociceptive pain, neuropathic pain, and nociplastic pain (along with associated symptoms), is correlated with high rates of opioidand gabapentinprescription in patients with cirrhosis. Both opioid and gabapentinoid use are correlated with poor functional status and quality of life,–as well as increased risk of hepatic encephalopathy. Furthermore, opioids are often prescribed with benzodiazepines, increasing the risk of falls in patients with cirrhosis.HRQOL, health‐related quality of life.

Elimination

After single administration of tramadol hydrochloride extended-release tablets, the mean terminal plasma elimination half-lives of racemic tramadol and racemic M1 are 6.5 ± 1.5 and 7.5 ± 1.4 hours, respectively.

Metabolism

Tramadol is extensively metabolized after oral administration. The major metabolic pathways appear to be N- and O-demethylation and glucuronidation or sulfation in the liver. N-demethylation is mediated by CYP3A4 and CYP2B6. One metabolite (O-desmethyltramadol, denoted M1) is pharmacologically active in animal models. Formation of M1 is dependent on CYP2D6 and as such is subject to inhibition and polymorphism, which may affect the therapeutic response [see PRECAUTIONS - Drug Interactions].

Excretion

Approximately 30% of the dose is excreted in the urine as unchanged drug, whereas 60% of the dose is excreted as metabolites. The remainder is excreted either as unidentified or as unextractable metabolites.

Special Populations

Hepatic Impairment

The metabolism of tramadol and M1 is reduced in patients with advanced cirrhosis of the liver, resulting in both a larger area under the concentration time curve (AUC) for tramadol and longer mean tramadol and M1 elimination half-lives (13 hours for tramadol and 19 hours for M1) after the administration of tramadol immediate-release tablets. Tramadol hydrochloride extended-release tablets have not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment. The limited availability of dose strengths and once daily dosing of tramadol hydrochloride extended-release tablets do not permit the dosing flexibility required for safe use in patients with hepatic impairment. Therefore, tramadol hydrochloride extended-release tablets should not be used in patients with hepatic impairment [see WARNINGS, Use in Renal and Hepatic Disease and DOSAGE and ADMINISTRATION].

### AGA clinical practice update on surgical risk assessment and perioperative management in cirrhosis: expert review [^111Bf8wx]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2019). High credibility.

Pain control in cirrhosis — "Opiates should generally be used at lower than standard doses and at longer dosing intervals than in the general population", and although randomized trials are lacking, "hydromorphone and fentanyl may be the preferred agents". For anxiolysis/sedation, "only short-acting benzodiazepines such as midazolam should be used". For non-opioid analgesia, "Tramadol… or acetaminophen, at a dose of no more than 2 g daily, is also recommended", whereas "routine use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which can impair renal blood flow in patients with cirrhosis", is cautioned and "oral combination products… especially when combined with an opioid, should not be used". Postoperative encephalopathy prevention includes bowel care: "Avoid constipation… ", "Polyethylene glycol solution may be used daily", and "rifaximin may be preferable… because it generally causes less bowel distention than lactulose".

### Tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen [^114FMZ5k]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Acetaminophen is primarily metabolized in the liver by first-order kinetics and involves three principal separate pathways:

a) conjugation with glucuronide;

b) conjugation with sulfate; and

c) oxidation via the cytochrome, P450-dependent, mixed-function oxidase enzyme pathway to form a reactive intermediate metabolite, which conjugates with glutathione and is then further metabolized to form cysteine and mercapturic acid conjugates. The principal cytochrome P450 isoenzyme involved appears to be CYP2E1, with CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 as additional pathways.

In adults, the majority of acetaminophen is conjugated with glucuronic acid and, to a lesser extent, with sulfate. These glucuronide-, sulfate-, and glutathione-derived metabolites lack biologic activity. In premature infants, newborns, and young infants, the sulfate conjugate predominates.

Excretion

Approximately 30% of the tramadol dose is excreted in the urine as unchanged drug, whereas 60% of the dose is excreted as metabolites.

Less than 9% of acetaminophen is excreted unchanged in the urine.

Special Populations

Hepatic Impairment

Pharmacokinetics of tramadol was studied in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment after receiving multiple doses of tramadol extended-release 100 mg. The exposure of (+)-and (-)-tramadol was similar in mild and moderate hepatic impairment patients in comparison to patients with normal hepatic function. However, exposure of (+)- and (-)-M1 decreased ~50% with increased severity of the hepatic impairment (from normal to mild and moderate). The pharmacokinetics of tramadol after the administration of tramadol extended-release has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment. After the administration of tramadol immediate-release tablets to patients with advanced cirrhosis of the liver, tramadol area under the plasma concentration time curve was larger and the tramadol and M1 half-lives were longer than subjects with normal hepatic function [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

### Contemporary management of pain in cirrhosis: toward precision therapy for pain [^114m7Ypo]. Hepatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Treatment

Treatment of neuropathic pain involves pharmaceuticals and/or local interventions (e.g. nerve blocks). First‐line pharmacologic treatment for neuropathic pain is monotherapy with gabapentin or pregabalin, a TCA, or an SNRI. Lidocaine patches can be used for either isolated symptoms or postherpetic neuralgia. Topical capsaicin can be used for peripheral neuropathic pain. If first‐line therapies are ineffective or not tolerated, tramadol or oxycodone can be trialed. Interventional therapies, including nerve blocks, nerve stimulation, and intrathecal therapies, are considered for certain patients if pharmacologic treatment is ineffective or intolerable.

Adjunct, noninvasive, nonpharmacologic therapies can also be used. A recent review on integrative therapies for painful peripheral neuropathy showed that interventions such as diet and exercise modification, vitamin/antioxidant supplementation, acupuncture, and yoga can be useful for symptom management. Whereas evidence supporting psychological therapies in neuropathic pain is mixed, CBT shows a benefit for pain and distress in chronic pain, generally, and thus may be useful in this population, as well.

Considerations in cirrhosis

Lidocaine patches, topical capsaicin, and TCAs are generally appropriate medication options for patients with cirrhosis.SNRIs (e.g., duloxetine, venlafaxine) can be used at low doses, titrated to a maximum of 50% of that used in patients without cirrhosis.TCAs can be trialed at low doses (e.g. nortryptiline 10 mg nightly); however, the associated sedating and anticholinergic effects can be exacerbated in patients with cirrhosis. Whereas gabapentin is renally excreted and not hepatically metabolized, it is associated with an increased risk of HE, as well as ataxia and sedation, so should be used with caution and started at low doses (e.g. 300 mg per day). Tramadol is felt to have a better adverse effect profile than other opioids, but supportive data are limited in cirrhosis, and it is associated with lowered seizure threshold and risk of serotonin syndrome if combined with medications such as TCAs or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Oxycodone has altered pharmacokinetics in cirrhosis but may be started at a low dose (e.g. 2.5 mg by mouth every 6–8 h as needed). All opioid medications can cause constipation, increasing the risk of HE.

### AASLD practice guidance: palliative care and symptom-based management in decompensated cirrhosis [^1173ewPM]. Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

Table 6 — Palliative symptom management in decompensated cirrhosis outlines options for dyspnea, muscle cramps, pruritus, and nausea/vomiting. For dyspnea, nonpharmacotherapies include managing reversible causes, bedside fans, supplemental oxygen therapy, mindfulness-based practices, paracentesis, thoracentesis, and placement of drains in hospice settings; pharmacotherapies note that opioids can be used cautiously in select cases at the end of life with an example starting dose of i.v. hydromorphone 0.2 mg every 3 h as needed, and anxiolytics can be considered for dyspnea‑associated anxiety. For muscle cramps, taurine (2–3 g daily), vitamin E (300 mg three times a day), and baclofen (5–10 mg three times a day) are listed. For pruritus, cholestyramine (4 g/d, titrated to 16 g/d if needed) and sertraline (25 mg/d, titrated to 75–100 mg if needed) are options; RIF and naltrexone may improve pruritus but have limited use in palliative treatment of patients with DC, and antihistamines may help pruritus‑associated sleep disturbance given their sedating properties. For nausea and vomiting, antacids (if contributing reflux) are included; ondansetron, up to 8 mg/d is preferred; metoclopramide up to 60 mg/d is noted, with alternatives such as prochlorperazine or haloperidol depending on goals of care; acupuncture is mentioned with caution if platelets < 50,000.

### The safe use of analgesics in patients with cirrhosis: a narrative review [^111nkKXt]. The American Journal of Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Pain is prevalent in patients with cirrhosis. Due to potential alterations in drug metabolism, risk for adverse effects, and complications from cirrhosis, physicians are often faced with difficult choices when choosing appropriate analgesics in these patients. Overall, acetaminophen remains the preferred analgesic. Despite its potential for intrinsic liver toxicity, acetaminophen is safe when used at 2 g/d. In contrast, non-selective nonsteroidals should be avoided due to their multiple side effects, including worsening renal function, blunting diuretic response, and increasing risk of portal hypertensive and peptic ulcer bleeding. Celecoxib can be administered for short term (≤ 5 days) in patients with Child's A and Child's B cirrhosis (50% dose reduction). Opioids carry the risk of precipitating hepatic encephalopathy and should generally be avoided, when possible. If clinical situation demands their use, opioid use should be limited to short-acting agents for short duration. Gabapentin and pregabalin are generally safe. Duloxetine should be avoided in hepatic impairment. Topical diclofenac and lidocaine seem to be safe in patients with cirrhosis.

### Contemporary management of pain in cirrhosis: toward precision therapy for pain [^116fERSi]. Hepatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Chronic pain is highly prevalent in patients with cirrhosis and is associated with poor health‐related quality of life and poor functional status. However, there is limited guidance on appropriate pain management in this population, and pharmacologic treatment can be harmful, leading to adverse outcomes, such as gastrointestinal bleeding, renal injury, falls, and hepatic encephalopathy. Chronic pain can be categorized mechanistically into three pain types: nociceptive, neuropathic, and nociplastic, each responsive to different therapies. By discussing the identification, etiology, and treatment of these three mechanistic pain descriptors with a focus on specific challenges in patients with cirrhosis, we provide a framework for better tailoring treatments, including nonpharmacologic therapies, to patients' needs.

### Tramadol hydrochloride [^114cxRAs]. FDA. Low credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of tramadol hydrochloride PO (also known as Ultram, Qdolo):
- Adrenal insufficiency, opioid-induced hyperalgesia: maintain a high level of suspicion, as tramadol has been associated with an increased risk for these adverse events.
- Decreased blood glucose: use caution in patients with predisposing risk factors, such as diabetes.
- Decreased serum sodium, decreased blood glucose: maintain a high level of suspicion, as tramadol has been associated with an increased risk for these adverse events.
- Exacerbation of increased ICP: use caution in patients with increased ICP, brain tumor, or head injury.
- Hypotension, syncope: use caution in patients with reduced blood volume or taking other CNS depressants. Monitor BP after initiation and dose titration. Avoid use in patients with circulatory shock.
- Mask symptoms of head injury: use caution in patients with head injury. Avoid use in patients with impaired consciousness or coma.
- Opioid withdrawal syndrome: do not discontinue abruptly in patients physically dependent on opioids.
- Opioid withdrawal syndrome: use extreme caution in patients taking mixed agonist/antagonist analgesics (such as pentazocine, nalbuphine, or butorphanol) or partial agonist analgesics (such as buprenorphine).
- Respiratory depression: use caution in patients with significant COPD, cor pulmonale, substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or preexisting respiratory depression. Obtain monitoring, especially after initiation and dose titration.
- Seizure: use caution in patients taking higher doses of tramadol, concomitant use of SSRIs, TCAs, other tricyclic compounds, other opioids, neuroleptics, or naloxone, or with a history of a seizure disorder.
- Serotonin syndrome: use caution in patients taking serotonergic drugs.
- Somnolence: use extreme caution in patients performing activities requiring mental alertness, such as driving or operating machinery.
- Sphincter of Oddi dysfunction: use caution in patients with gastrointestinal disorders. Monitor patients with biliary tract disease for disease worsening, including acute pancreatitis.
- Suicidal ideation: use caution in patients with a history of misuse and/or taking CNS-active drugs, including tranquilizers or antidepressant drugs, excessive alcohol use, or having emotional disturbance or depression. Do not use in suicidal or addiction-prone patients.

Precautions

Use in Renal and Hepatic Disease

Impaired renal function results in a decreased rate and extent of excretion of tramadol and its active metabolite, M1 in patients taking an immediate-release formulation of tramadol. Tramadol hydrochloride extended-release tablets have not been studied in patients with renal impairment. The limited availability of dose strengths and once daily dosing of tramadol hydrochloride extended-release tablets do not permit the dosing flexibility required for safe use in patients with renal impairment. Therefore, tramadol hydrochloride extended-release tablets should not be used in patients with severe renal impairment [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY and DOSAGE and ADMINISTRATION].

The metabolism of tramadol and M1 is reduced in patients with advanced cirrhosis of the liver. Tramadol hydrochloride extended-release tablets have not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment. The limited availability of dose strengths and once daily dosing of tramadol hydrochloride extended-release tablets do not permit the dosing flexibility required for safe use in patients with hepatic impairment. Therefore, tramadol hydrochloride extended-release tablets should not be used in patients with hepatic impairment [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY and DOSAGE and ADMINISTRATION].

Information for Patients

Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide).

Storage and Disposal

Because of the risks associated with accidental ingestion, misuse, and abuse, advise patients to store tramadol hydrochloride extended-release tablets securely, out of sight and reach of children, and in a location not accessible by others, including visitors to the home [see WARNINGS, DRUG ABUSE and DEPENDENCE]. Inform patients that leaving tramadol hydrochloride extended-release tablets unsecured can pose a deadly risk to others in the home.

Results

Indications for which tramadol is prescribed

According to the experts, tramadol is used in the management of moderate to severe acute and chronic pain caused by a wide range of conditions. Their rating of the significance of tramadol as a treatment option for various pain indications is shown in Figure 2.

Almost all the specialists treat moderate cancer pain with tramadol, a modality that is supported in the literature.–Most of them rated it as significant or highly significant in managing this condition. Important factors influencing their choice of analgesic was tramadol's efficacy in both nociceptive and neuropathic pain, which often occur concurrently in cancer pain, its position as a step two analgesic on the WHO "pain ladder", and patients' preference for it over low-dose strong opioids. Respondents from India, Indonesia and Pakistan also stated that there is limited or no availability of controlled opioid analgesics in their countries. Although tramadol does not have the same potency as strong opioid analgesics such as morphine for treating severe cancer pain, tramadol is often the only option available.

Every one of the respondents considered tramadol to be either significant or highly significant in the treatment of moderate to severe non-cancer pain in their home country, specifically mentioning acute indications such as labor pain, postoperative and post-traumatic pain, and chronic indications such as low back pain and osteoarthritis. It is considered an alternative to NSAIDs or strong opioids, particularly suitable for elderly patients or those with poor liver and/or renal function.

The majority of respondents rated tramadol as significant or highly significant in the management of acute postoperative pain and acute musculoskeletal pain. Specific examples quoted were the combination of tramadol with WHO step one analgesics or as an alternative to them, and its use as a step-down analgesic from strong opioids following surgery.

Efficacy must be carefully balanced against safety when long-term treatment is required for chronic conditions such as osteoarthritis and chronic low back pain, and around three-quarters of respondents regarded tramadol as being significant or highly significant in managing these conditions. Factors contributing to this rating included its efficacy in mixed pain (ie, with nociceptive and neuropathic components), and its favorable benefit/risk ratio in prolonged use. It was specifically noted that the safety issues associated with NSAIDs often limit their use, particularly in chronic pain patients and the elderly, so tramadol is frequently substituted – an approach which is reflected in the current literature.

5.8 Opioid-Induced Hyperalgesia and Allodynia

Opioid-Induced Hyperalgesia (OIH) occurs when an opioid analgesic paradoxically causes an increase in pain, or an increase in sensitivity to pain. This condition differs from tolerance, which is the need for increasing doses of opioids to maintain a defined effect [see Dependence (9.3)]. Symptoms of OIH include (but may not be limited to) increased levels of pain upon opioid dosage increase, decreased levels of pain upon opioid dosage decrease, or pain from ordinarily non-painful stimuli (allodynia). These symptoms may suggest OIH only if there is no evidence of underlying disease progression, opioid tolerance, opioid withdrawal, or addictive behavior.

Cases of OIH have been reported, both with short-term and longer-term use of opioid analgesics. Though the mechanism of OIH is not fully understood, multiple biochemical pathways have been implicated. Medical literature suggests a strong biologic plausibility between opioid analgesics and OIH and allodynia. If a patient is suspected to be experiencing OIH, carefully consider appropriately decreasing the dose of the current opioid analgesic, or opioid rotation (safely switching the patient to a different opioid moiety) [see Dosage and Administration (2.5); Warnings and Precautions (5.21)].

5.9 Hepatotoxicity

Tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets contains tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen. Acetaminophen has been associated with cases of acute liver failure, at times resulting in liver transplant and death. Most of the cases of liver injury are associated with the use of acetaminophen at doses that exceed 4,000 milligrams per day, and often involve more than one acetaminophen-containing product. The excessive intake of acetaminophen may be intentional to cause self-harm or unintentional as patients attempt to obtain more pain relief or unknowingly take other acetaminophen-containing products.

The risk of acute liver failure is higher in individuals with underlying liver disease and in individuals who ingest alcohol while taking acetaminophen.

Instruct patients to look for acetaminophen or APAP on package labels and not to use more than one product that contains acetaminophen. Instruct patients to seek medical attention immediately upon ingestion of more than 4,000 milligrams of acetaminophen per day, even if they feel well.

### Tramadol / paracetamol fixed-dose combination in the treatment of moderate to severe pain [^112cY8Jc]. Journal of Pain Research (2012). Low credibility.

Pain is the most common reason patients seek medical attention and pain relief has been put forward as an ethical obligation of clinicians and a fundamental human right. However, pain management is challenging because the pathophysiology of pain is complex and not completely understood. Widely used analgesics such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and paracetamol (acetaminophen) have been associated with adverse events. Adverse event rates are of concern, especially in long-term treatment or at high doses. Paracetamol and NSAIDs are available by prescription, over the counter, and in combination preparations. Patients may be unaware of the risk associated with high dosages or long-term use of paracetamol and NSAIDs. Clinicians should encourage patients to disclose all medications they take in a "do ask, do tell" approach that includes patient education about the risks and benefits of common pain relievers. The ideal pain reliever would have few risks and enhanced analgesic efficacy. Fixed-dose combination analgesics with two or more agents may offer additive or synergistic benefits to treat the multiple mechanisms of pain. Therefore, pain may be effectively treated while toxicity is reduced due to lower doses. One recent fixed-dose combination analgesic product combines tramadol, a centrally acting weak opioid analgesic, with low-dose paracetamol. Evidence-based guidelines recognize the potential value of combination analgesics in specific situations. The current guideline-based paradigm for pain treatment recommends NSAIDs for ongoing use with analgesics such as opioids to manage flares. However, the treatment model should evolve how to use low-dose combination products to manage pain with occasional use of NSAIDs for flares to avoid long-term and high-dose treatment with these analgesics. A next step in pain management guidelines should be targeted therapy when possible, or low-dose combination therapy or both, to achieve maximal efficacy with minimal toxicity.

Dyspnea in cirrhosis — palliative management emphasizes assessment, nonpharmacologic measures first, and cautious pharmacologic use aligned with patient goals. General principles state dyspnea should be approached by first assessing and addressing underlying causes, balanced with patient preferences; disease-directed therapies may be used as appropriate, and procedural options include paracentesis, thoracentesis, and TIPS. Indwelling abdominal drains may be used in some cases to address volume-related dyspnea when goals are comfort focused and have been associated with improved quality of life. Nonpharmacological treatments include supplemental oxygen (even in the absence of hypoxia) or a bedside fan, and self-care practices like relaxation, meditation, and guided imagery may decrease dyspnea. The mainstays of pharmacological management at the end of life are low-dose opioids and benzodiazepines; opioids or benzodiazepines should be used with caution, with careful discussion of risks and benefits, and because morphine is relatively contraindicated in advanced cirrhosis, clinicians should first consider hydromorphone or oxycodone. Guidance statements specify that patients should routinely be assessed for dyspnea and its impact on patient quality of life, function, and caregivers; nonpharmacological therapies should be used when possible (fan, supplemental oxygen, mindfulness); and pharmacological interventions may include opioids and anxiolytics with careful consideration of risks, goals, and prognosis.

### Contemporary management of pain in cirrhosis: toward precision therapy for pain [^115ir1ny]. Hepatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Chronic pain is highly prevalent in patients with cirrhosis and is associated with poor health-related quality of life and poor functional status. However, there is limited guidance on appropriate pain management in this population, and pharmacologic treatment can be harmful, leading to adverse outcomes, such as gastrointestinal bleeding, renal injury, falls, and hepatic encephalopathy. Chronic pain can be categorized mechanistically into three pain types: nociceptive, neuropathic, and nociplastic, each responsive to different therapies. By discussing the identification, etiology, and treatment of these three mechanistic pain descriptors with a focus on specific challenges in patients with cirrhosis, we provide a framework for better tailoring treatments, including nonpharmacologic therapies, to patients' needs.

### AASLD practice guidance: palliative care and symptom-based management in decompensated cirrhosis [^112TA27V]. Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

AASLD guidance statements — pain in patients with cirrhosis emphasize that multimodal pain management approaches are ideal and include a person-centered holistic, multidisciplinary approach, engaging a combination of expertise from across a number of specialties; pain in patients with DC requires a systematic approach that starts with assessing and treating reversible causes of pain; and localized pain should first be addressed with local, rather than systemic, therapies. Acetaminophen, 500 mg every 6 h, up to a maximum dose of 2 g/d, is the preferred first-line pharmacotherapy for the management of pain in patients with cirrhosis, and systemic NSAIDs should be avoided in patients with cirrhosis. We recommend avoiding opioids, when possible, for chronic pain. However, when necessary, opioid use should be approached with caution and with careful discussion with patients and caregivers. Low-dose oxycodone or hydromorphone can be started in select cases on an as-needed basis and titrated to effect, often in consultation with pain management experts.

Comorbidities influencing analgesic use

Studies have shown that a number of comorbidities influence the treatment outcomes of analgesic therapy. It is widely known that several chronic pain conditions are accompanied by psychosocial comorbidities such as anxiety and depression, which may amplify the pain perception, physical function, adaptation and treatment response. Systematic screening of patients for any associated psychiatric comorbidity may support the physician in deciding the treatment plan. In the case of suspected depression, antidepressants may be added to the therapeutic regimen to control the clinical symptoms. While psychiatric comorbidities significantly affect the emotional response to pain, any coexisting physical comorbidities may affect the efficacy and tolerability of the analgesic. For example, decreased liver function may significantly affect the metabolism of NSAIDs and opioids, leading to increased levels in blood and associated toxicity. Preliminary screening by performing liver function tests and assessment of the Child–Pugh score may be important in determining liver failure. Similar considerations are necessitated in suspected gastrointestinal or renal comorbidities.

### AGA clinical practice update on surgical risk assessment and perioperative management in cirrhosis: expert review [^115Lekho]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2019). High credibility.

AGA Clinical Practice Update — postoperative portal hypertension and medication safety in cirrhosis advises the following: Aggressively avoid exacerbations of portal hypertension and associated complications in the postoperative period. Appropriate measures include close monitoring of renal function and avoidance of volume excess or depletion, and Excess volume can increase the risk of variceal and other portal hypertensive bleeding. Due to disturbed metabolism and elimination, patients with cirrhosis are at especially high risk for medication-related complications; generally, use opiates at lower doses and with longer dosing intervals than in the general population, use only short-acting benzodiazepines, and Avoidance of constipation should be a priority in the management of these patients to minimize flares of hepatic encephalopathy in the postoperative period, noting that In patients who can take medications orally, rifaximin generally causes less bowel distention than nonabsorbable disaccharides (lactulose). Avoid medications that might be toxic in patients with portal hypertension and cirrhosis. Do not use NSAIDs because they can impair renal blood flow, patients with cirrhosis can be susceptible to acetaminophen toxicity at doses lower than those that may cause toxicity in the general population, and Do not prescribe combination opiate/acetaminophen pain relievers to take home after surgery because the patient may be unaware of the presence of acetaminophen in various over-the-counter products and unintentional acetaminophen overdose and hepatotoxicity can result.

### Tramadol hydrochloride (Ultram ER) [^111mxiEK]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

Hepatic

Pharmacokinetics of tramadol was studied in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment after receiving multiple doses of ULTRAM ER 100 mg. The exposure of (+)- and (-)-tramadol was similar in mild and moderate hepatic impairment patients in comparison to patients with normal hepatic function. However, exposure of (+)- and (-)-M1 decreased ~50% with increased severity of the hepatic impairment (from normal to mild and moderate). The pharmacokinetics of tramadol after the administration of ULTRAM ER has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment. After the administration of tramadol immediate-release tablets to patients with advanced cirrhosis of the liver, tramadol area under the plasma concentration time curve was larger and the tramadol and M1 half-lives were longer than subjects with normal hepatic function. The limited availability of dose strengths of ULTRAM ER does not permit the dosing flexibility required for safe use in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Therefore, ULTRAM ER should not be used in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see PRECAUTIONS, Use in Renal and Hepatic Disease and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

Geriatric

The effect of age on the absorption of tramadol from ULTRAM ER in patients over the age of 65 years has not been studied and is unknown (see PRECAUTIONS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

Gender

Based on pooled multiple-dose pharmacokinetics studies for ULTRAM ER in 166 healthy subjects (111 males and 55 females), the dose-normalized AUC values for tramadol were somewhat higher in females than in males. There was a considerable degree of overlap in values between male and female groups. Dosage adjustment based on gender is not recommended.

### Tramadol hcl and acetaminophen [^112NvCoy]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Acetaminophen

In acute acetaminophen overdosage, dose-dependent, potentially fatal hepatic necrosis is the most serious adverse effect. Renal tubular necrosis, hypoglycemic coma, and thrombocytopenia also occur. Plasma acetaminophen levels > 300 mcg/mL at 4 hours after oral ingestion were associated with hepatic damage in 90% of patients; minimal hepatic damage is anticipated if plasma levels at 4 hours are < 150 mcg/mL or < 37.5 mcg/mL at 12 hours after ingestion. Early symptoms following a potentially hepatotoxic overdose may include: nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis, and general malaise. Clinical and laboratory evidence of hepatic toxicity may not be apparent until 48 to 72 hours post-ingestion.

Treatment of Overdose

A single or multiple drug overdose with tramadol and acetaminophen is a potentially lethal polydrug overdose. Immediate treatment includes support of cardiorespiratory function and measures to reduce drug absorption. Oxygen, intravenous fluids, vasopressors, assisted ventilation, and other supportive measures should be employed as indicated. Because strategies for the management of overdose are continually evolving, it is advisable to contact a poison control center (where available) to determine the latest recommendations for the management of an overdose.

Tramadol

In case of overdose, priorities are the reestablishment of a patent and protected airway and institution of assisted or controlled ventilation, if needed. Employ other supportive measures (including oxygen and vasopressors) in the management of circulatory shock and pulmonary edema as indicated. Cardiac arrest or arrhythmias will require advanced life-support measures.

### Tramadol acetaminophen [^1156nmWo]. FDA (2016). Low credibility.

Concerns about abuse, addiction, and diversion should not prevent the proper management of pain. The development of addiction to opioid analgesics in properly managed patients with pain has been reported to be rare. However, data are not available to establish the true incidence of addiction in chronic pain patients.

Risk of Overdosage

Patients taking tramadol should be warned not to exceed the dose recommended by their physician. Tramadol products in excessive doses, either alone or in combination with other CNS depressants, including alcohol, are a cause of drug-related deaths. Patients should be cautioned about the concomitant use of tramadol products and alcohol because of potentially serious CNS additive effects of these agents. Because of its added depressant effects, tramadol should be prescribed with caution for those patients whose medical condition requires the concomitant administration of sedatives, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, tricyclic antidepressants, or other CNS depressant drugs. Patients should be advised of the additive depressant effects of these combinations.

Serious potential consequences of overdosage with tramadol are central nervous system depression, respiratory depression and death. Some deaths have occurred as a consequence of the accidental ingestion of excessive quantities of tramadol alone or in combination with other drugs. In treating an overdose, primary attention should be given to maintaining adequate ventilation along with general supportive treatment (see OVERDOSAGE).

A serious potential consequence of overdosage with acetaminophen is hepatic (centrilobular) necrosis, leading to hepatic failure and death. Emergency help should be sought immediately and treatment initiated immediately if overdose is suspected, even if symptoms are not apparent.

Withdrawal

Withdrawal symptoms may occur if tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets are discontinued abruptly (see also DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE). Reported symptoms have included anxiety, sweating, insomnia, rigors, pain, nausea, tremors, diarrhea, upper respiratory symptoms, piloerection, and rarely hallucinations. Other symptoms that have been reported less frequently with tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets discontinuation include: panic attacks, severe anxiety, and paresthesias. Clinical experience suggests that withdrawal symptoms may be avoided by tapering tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets at the time of discontinuation.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Elderly patients (65 years of age or older) may have increased sensitivity to tramadol. In general, use caution when selecting a dosage for an elderly patient, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.

Respiratory depression is the chief risk for elderly patients treated with opioids, and has occurred after large initial doses were administered to patients who were not opioid-tolerant or when opioids were co-administered with other agents that depress respiration. Titrate the dosage of tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen slowly in geriatric patients and frequently reevaluate the patient for signs of central nervous system and respiratory depression [see Warnings and Precautions (5.13)].

Tramadol and acetaminophen are known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to regularly evaluate renal function.

8.6 Hepatic Impairment

The pharmacokinetics and tolerability of tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen in patients with impaired hepatic function have not been studied. Based on information using tramadol immediate-release tablets in subjects with advanced cirrhosis of the liver, tramadol exposure was higher and half-lives of tramadol and active metabolite M1 were longer than in subjects with normal hepatic function [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

As tramadol and acetaminophen are both extensively metabolized by the liver, the use of tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen in patients with hepatic impairment is not recommended [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)].

8.7 Renal Impairment

The pharmacokinetics and tolerability of tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen in patients with renal impairment has not been studied. Based on studies using tramadol extended-release tablets, the excretion of tramadol and metabolite M1 is reduced in patients with creatinine clearance of less than 30 mL/min. In patients with creatinine clearances of less than 30 mL/min, it is recommended that the dosage of tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen not exceed 2 tablets every 12 hours [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. The total amount of tramadol and M1 removed during a 4 hour dialysis period is less than 7% of the administered dose based on studies using tramadol alone. Regularly evaluate closely for signs of respiratory depression, sedation, and hypotension.

### Tramadol hydrochloride [^1129kvTK]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Special Populations

Hepatic Impairment

Metabolism of tramadol and is reduced in patients with severe hepatic impairment based on a study in patients with advanced cirrhosis of the liver, resulting in both a larger area under the concentration time curve for tramadol and longer tramadol and M1 elimination half-lives (13 hrs. for tramadol and 19 hrs. for M1). In patients with severe hepatic impairment, adjustment of the dosing regimen is recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2)].

Renal Impairment

Impaired renal function results in a decreased rate and extent of excretion of tramadol and its active metabolite, M1. In patients with creatinine clearances of less than 30 mL/min, adjustment of the dosing regimen is recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2)]. The total amount of tramadol and M1 removed during a 4-hour dialysis period is less than 7% of the administered dose.

Age: Geriatric

Healthy elderly subjects aged 65 to 75 years have plasma tramadol concentrations and elimination half-lives comparable to those observed in healthy subjects less than 65 years of age. In subjects over 75 years, maximum serum concentrations are elevated (208 vs. 162 ng/mL) and the elimination half-life is prolonged (7 vs. 6 hours) compared to subjects 65 to 75 years of age. Adjustment of the daily dose is recommended for patients older than 75 years [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

### Cirrhosis inpatients receive more opioids and fewer nonopioid analgesics than patients without cirrhosis [^115khvEp]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Goals/Background

Pain is common among cirrhosis patients, particularly those hospitalized with acute illness. Managing pain in this population is challenging due to concern for adverse events and lack of guidelines for analgesic use. We sought to characterize analgesic use among inpatients with cirrhosis compared with matched noncirrhosis controls, as well as hospital-level variation in prescribing patterns.

Methods

We utilized the Vizient Clinical Database, which includes clinical and billing data from hospitalizations at > 500 US academic medical centers. We identified cirrhosis patients hospitalized in 2017–2018, and a matched cohort of noncirrhosis patients. Types of analgesic given-acetaminophen (APAP), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), opioids, and adjuvants (eg, gabapentinoids, antidepressants) were defined from inpatient prescription records. Conditional logistic regression was used to associate cirrhosis diagnosis with analgesic use.

Results

Of 116,363 cirrhosis inpatients, 83% received at least 1 dose of an analgesic and 58% had regular inpatient analgesic use, rates that were clinically similar to noncirrhosis controls. Cirrhosis inpatients were half as likely to receive APAP (26% vs. 42%, P < 0.01) or NSAIDs (3% vs. 7%, P < 0.01), but were more likely to receive opioids (59% vs. 54%, P < 0.01), particularly decompensated patients (60%). There was notable variation in analgesic prescribing patterns between hospitals, especially among cirrhosis patients.

Conclusions

Analgesic use was common among inpatients, with similar rates among patients with and without cirrhosis. Cirrhosis patients-particularly decompensated patients-were less likely to receive APAP and NSAIDs and more likely to receive opioid analgesics. Because of lack of evidence-based guidance for management of cirrhosis patients with pain, providers may avoid nonopioid analgesics due to perceived risks and consequently may overutilize opioids in this high-risk population.

### AASLD practice guidance: palliative care and symptom-based management in decompensated cirrhosis [^114D76V3]. Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

AASLD Practice Guidance — pruritus management in decompensated cirrhosis (DC) notes that initial treatment includes moisturizing creams, avoidance of hot baths and rubbing of the skin, minimizing use of harsh soaps and detergents, and using loose-fitting clothing and cool humidified air; antihistamines may have sedating effects or exacerbate encephalopathy and are generally not efficacious for pruritus attributable to cholestasis, though their sedating properties may help pruritus-mediated sleep disturbances. Cholestyramine was shown to be effective in randomized studies with small numbers of patients (n = 8 and n = 10), and the recommended starting dose for cholestyramine is 4 g/d, with titration up to 16 g/d as needed and tolerated. For RIF, RIF should be initiated at a quarter dose and titrated slowly to 150–300 mg twice daily with careful monitoring of liver biochemistries, and RIF should not be used in patients with bilirubin levels > 2.5 mg/dL. Naltrexone for this indication requires a low dose, starting with 12.5 mg daily and up-titrating every 3–7 days to reach the maximum dose of 50 mg/d, and naltrexone use is also often inappropriate in persons receiving opioids for pain because it can block opioid binding, thus reducing analgesia and potentially causing opioid withdrawal. Sertraline has been shown to reduce cholestatic pruritus symptoms at 75- to 100-mg doses and, because sertraline is largely metabolized in the liver, it requires careful administration, for example a starting dose of 25 mg with titration in patients with DC.

CHALLENGES IN THE MANAGEMENT OF CHRONIC PAIN

Cirrhosis presents unique challenges in pain management. First, consensus is lacking for the management of pain, and pharmacologic options are limited. There are recommendations to limit the use of acetaminophen (≤ 2 g per day) and avoid nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)/opioids. If opioids are to be considered, expert opinion recommends weak opioids such as tramadol or hydromorphone for nociceptive pain and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) or gabapentin for neuropathic pain. Efficacy data, however, are limited.

Second, virtually any pharmacologic intervention can be difficult and dangerous for patients with cirrhosis. For example, NSAIDs are used by 10%–30% of patients with cirrhosis, increasing the risk of ascites, kidney injury, and gastrointestinal bleeding. Even short‐term use of NSAIDs can be deleterious, as just five doses of 500 mg of naproxen has been correlated with decreased kidney function, decreased response to furosemide, and inhibited platelet aggregation and thromboxane B 2 production in patients with cirrhosis. Prescription rates for gabapentin have also increased severalfold. Both opioids and gabapentinoids are associated with unique harms in cirrhosis, including worse health‐related quality of life (HRQOL)and increased risk of hepatic encephalopathy (HE), a frequent complication of cirrhosis that markedly increases mortality. The mechanisms for the harms of psychoactive medications are multifold. First, cirrhosis pushes toxins from the gastrointestinal tract (e.g. ammonia) that would be normally detoxified by the liver into the bloodstream. These toxins impact brain and muscle function, leading to depression, sleep disturbance, impaired physical function, and poor HRQOL. These toxins lead to a dominant inhibitory tone in the brain that is exacerbated by drugs like gabapentin and benzodiazepines. Second, because opioids prolong intestinal transit time, a key determinant of toxin translocation from the gut, increased toxin load results. Despite the fact that opioids are not thought to be efficacious in chronic noncancer painand are associated with significant side effects, as many as half of patients with cirrhosis are prescribed opioids. Opioid prescription occurs more frequently in cirrhosis than in other chronic diseasesand is associated with a higher risk of opioid‐related toxicity and overdose in patients with liver disease. Furthermore, opioids are often prescribed with benzodiazepines, compounding the risk of adverse events, including fallsand potential overdose deaths. Thus, it is imperative to select pain management modalities to improve pain control while avoiding serious complications (Figure 1). To do so, we need to better understand and characterize the mechanistic drivers of pain in cirrhosis.

### Treatment of pain in cirrhosis: advice to caregivers of those with rock livers [^113QTqJB]. Clinical Therapeutics (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

When one considers the significant role of the liver in medication absorption and metabolism, clinicians must appreciate the important ramifications for medication dosing and monitoring in patients with cirrhosis. For many medications, dose adjustments may be necessary to minimize toxicities or avoid adverse effects from drug accumulation. Clinicians could be well served if they can understand in some detail how pharmacokinetic properties are altered in cirrhosis.

Methods

A PubMed search of the English medical literature starting with 1980 using keywords cirrhosis, pain management, and analgesics was performed, and additional papers were found using references from the first round of papers.

Findings

Patients with cirrhosis often have significant reductions in first-pass metabolism, altered volumes of distribution, and marked reductions in both renal and hepatic elimination of drugs. These factors may contribute to much higher levels of drug exposure compared to the general population. In terms of drug dosing, FDA labeling is often ambiguous and even incongruous with observed pharmacokinetic changes.

Implications

This article may provide guidance for clinicians to optimize pain management in people living with cirrhosis.

Key Message

Current FDA labeling for dosing analgesic drugs in patients with cirrhosis is either vague or not consistent with findings from newer pharmacokinetic research. With this review, we hope to provide insight and guidance to clinicians on how to dose-adjust medications commonly utilized in pain management in these patients.

Interactions with Drugs Affecting Cytochrome P450 Isoenzymes

The effects of concomitant use or discontinuation of cytochrome P450 3A4 inducers, 3A4 inhibitors, or 2D6 inhibitors with tramadol are complex. Use of cytochrome P450 3A4 inducers, 3A4 inhibitors, or 2D6 inhibitors with tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen requires careful consideration of the effects on the parent drug, tramadol, and the active metabolite, M1 [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7), Drug Interactions (7)].

Hepatotoxicity

Tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets contain tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen. Acetaminophen has been associated with cases of acute liver failure, at times resulting in liver transplant and death. Most of the cases of liver injury are associated with the use of acetaminophen at doses that exceed 4,000 milligrams per day, and often involve more than one acetaminophen-containing product [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)].

WARNING: SERIOUS AND LIFE-THREATENING RISKS FROM USE OF TRAMADOL HYDROCHLORIDE AND ACETAMINOPHEN TABLETS

See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning.

Tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen exposes users to the risks of addiction, abuse and misuse, which can lead to overdose and death. Assess each patient's risk prior to prescribing tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen, and monitor regularly for these behaviors or conditions. (5.1)
Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression may occur. Monitor closely, especially during initiation or following a dose increase. (5.2)
Accidental ingestion of tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen, especially by children, can result in a fatal overdose of tramadol. (5.2)
Concomitant use of opioids with benzodiazepines or other central nervous system (CNS) depressants, including alcohol, may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Reserve concomitant prescribing for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate; limit dosages and durations to the minimum required; and follow patients for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. (5.3, 7)
Prolonged use of tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen, during pregnancy can result in neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, which may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated If prolonged opioid use is required in a pregnant woman, advise the patient of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available. (5.4)
To ensure that the benefits of opioid analgesics outweigh the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has required a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) for these products. (5.5)
Life-threatening respiratory depression and death have occurred in children who received tramadol. Some of the reported cases followed tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy; in at least one case, the child had evidence of being an ultra-rapid metabolizer of tramadol due to a CYP2D6 polymorphism (5.6). Tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen is contraindicated in children younger than 12 years of age and in children younger than 18 years of age following tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy (4). Avoid the use of tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen in adolescents 12 to 18 years of age who have other risk factors that may increase their sensitivity to the respiratory depressant effects of tramadol. (5.6)
The effects of concomitant use or discontinuation of cytochrome P450 3A4 inducers, 3A4 inhibitors, or 2D6 inhibitors with tramadol are complex. Use of cytochrome P450 3A4 inducers, 3A4 inhibitors, or 2D6 inhibitors with tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen requires careful consideration of the effects on the parent drug, tramadol, and the active metabolite, M1.

### Tramadol hydrochloride (tramadol HCl) [^114cFKz1]. FDA (2007). Low credibility.

Special Populations

Renal

Impaired renal function results in a decreased rate and extent of excretion of tramadol and its active metabolite, M1. In patients with creatinine clearances of less than 30 mL/min, adjustment of the dosing regimen is recommended (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). The total amount of tramadol and M1 removed during a 4-hour dialysis period is less than 7% of the administered dose.

Hepatic

Metabolism of tramadol and M1 is reduced in patients with advanced cirrhosis of the liver, resulting in both a larger area under the concentration time curve for tramadol and longer tramadol and M1 elimination half-lives (13 hrs. for tramadol and 19 hrs. for M1). In cirrhotic patients, adjustment of the dosing regimen is recommended (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

Geriatric

Healthy elderly subjects aged 65 to 75 years have plasma tramadol concentrations and elimination half-lives comparable to those observed in healthy subjects less than 65 years of age. In subjects over 75 years, maximum serum concentrations are elevated (208 vs. 162 ng/mL) and the elimination half-life is prolonged (7 vs. 6 hours) compared to subjects 65 to 75 years of age. Adjustment of the daily dose is recommended for patients older than 75 years (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

Gender

The absolute bioavailability of tramadol was 73% in males and 79% in females. The plasma clearance was 6.4 mL/min/kg in males and 5.7 mL/min/kg in females following a 100 mg IV dose of tramadol. Following a single oral dose, and after adjusting for body weight, females had a 12% higher peak tramadol concentration and a 35% higher area under the concentration-time curve compared to males. The clinical significance of this difference is unknown.

### Contemporary management of pain in cirrhosis: toward precision therapy for pain [^114Hq3D6]. Hepatology (2023). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Chronic pain in cirrhosis is common, poorly characterized, and uniquely morbid. Reported by 40%–79% of patients with cirrhosis, it is a key driver of poor functional status and quality of life.–Patients with cirrhosis and chronic pain also have significantly greater health care use. Pain management in cirrhosis can be complex because of challenges in diagnosis and medical management. Unfortunately, there is limited guidance outlining optimal pain therapies in this population. Recent guidelines from the American Association for the Study of Liver Disease for palliative care and symptom management in decompensated cirrhosis recommend consulting experts in palliative care, psychiatry, and physical therapy, but pain is common across the spectrum of disease severity, and access to these supportive services can be difficult in many settings. Furthermore, pain phenotypes, each requiring specific treatments, have been poorly characterized in cirrhosis. Thus, proper evaluation and diagnosis are crucial to minimize unnecessary pharmacotherapy and maximize clinical and patient reported outcomes in patients with cirrhosis. Herein, we will define chronic pain mechanistically and discuss the identification, etiology, and treatment options for each type of pain with a focus on unique challenges in patients with cirrhosis.

### Pharmacologic therapy for acute pain [^1167EhT3]. American Family Physician (2021). Medium credibility.

Pharmacologic management of acute pain should be tailored for each patient, including a review of treatment expectations and a plan for the time course of prescriptions. Acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are first-line treatment options for most patients with acute mild to moderate pain. Topical NSAIDs are recommended for non-low back, musculoskeletal injuries. Acetaminophen is well tolerated; however, lower doses should be used in patients with advanced hepatic disease, malnutrition, or severe alcohol use disorder. Nonselective NSAIDs are effective but should be used with caution in patients with a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, cardiovascular disease, or chronic renal disease. Selective cyclooxygenase-2 NSAIDs are a more expensive treatment alternative and are used to avoid the gastrointestinal adverse effects of nonselective NSAIDs. Adjunctive medications may be added as appropriate for specific conditions if the recommended dose and schedule of first-line agents are inadequate (e.g., muscle relaxants may be useful for acute low back pain). For severe or refractory acute pain, treatment can be briefly escalated with the use of medications that work on opioid and monoamine receptors (e.g., tramadol, tapentadol) or with the use of acetaminophen/opioid or NSAID/opioid combinations. The opioid epidemic has increased physician and community awareness of the harms of opioid medications; however, severe acute pain may necessitate short-term use of opioids with attention to minimizing risk, including in patients on medication-assisted therapy for opioid use disorder.

### AASLD practice guidance: palliative care and symptom-based management in decompensated cirrhosis [^1118N8rf]. Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

Opioid selection and safety in cirrhosis — when opioids are required, "prophylactic medications should be considered proactively to prevent constipation and encephalopathy (e.g., lactulose)", and "codeine, morphine, and tramadol should generally be avoided in patients with cirrhosis". "Tramadol is often inappropriately selected for first-line use in patients with cirrhosis because of the perception that it is not an opioid", yet it "has variable pharmacokinetics across persons with cirrhosis… and has notably unpredictable side effects, including hypoglycemia". For transdermal fentanyl, "The patch comes in set doses with the lowest option of a 12-μg/h patch, which may be too high for patients with cirrhosis", and "cachexia is a relative contraindication to transdermal fentanyl", while "methadone should only be used in consultation with a specialist". "First-line opioids for patients with cirrhosis generally include low-dose hydromorphone (e.g., 1 mg p.o. or 0.4 mg i.v.) or oxycodone (e.g., 2.5 mg p.o.) with extended dosing intervals". Initiation should follow best practices: "Prescribing clinicians should adhere to best practices for risk assessment, setting patient expectations, and monitoring when starting opioids", "first-line treatment should be a 7-day supply of low-dose, short-acting opioids", and "Patients require close follow-up", with risk factors assessed such as "past opioid use disorder" and "concurrent benzodiazepine use" or other prescriptions in "prescription drug monitoring program data".

### Tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen (Ultracet) [^114i9PJZ]. FDA (2012). Low credibility.

Hepatotoxicity

ULTRACET contains tramadol HCl and acetaminophen. Acetaminophen has been associated with cases of acute liver failure, at times resulting in liver transplant and death. Most of the cases of liver injury are associated with the use of acetaminophen at doses that exceed 4,000 milligrams per day, and often involve more than one acetaminophen-containing product. The excessive intake of acetaminophen may be intentional to cause self-harm or unintentional as patients attempt to obtain more pain relief or unknowingly take other acetaminophen-containing products (see Boxed Warning).

The risk of acute liver failure is higher in individuals with underlying liver disease and in individuals who ingest alcohol while taking acetaminophen.

Instruct patients to look for acetaminophen or APAP on package labels and not to use more than one product that contains acetaminophen. Instruct patients to seek medical attention immediately upon ingestion of more than 4,000 milligrams of acetaminophen per day, even if they feel well.

Seizure Risk

Seizures have been reported in patients receiving tramadol within the recommended dosage range. Spontaneous post-marketing reports indicate that seizure risk is increased with doses of tramadol above the recommended range. Concomitant use of tramadol increases the seizure risk in patients taking:

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI antidepressants or anorectics),
Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and other tricyclic compounds (e.g., cyclobenzaprine, promethazine, etc.), or
Other opioids.

Administration of tramadol may enhance the seizure risk in patients taking:

MAO inhibitors (see also WARNINGS, Use with MAO Inhibitors and Serotonin Re-uptake Inhibitors),
Neuroleptics, or
Other drugs that reduce the seizure threshold.

Risk of convulsions may also increase in patients with epilepsy, those with a history of seizures, or in patients with a recognized risk for seizure (such as head trauma, metabolic disorders, alcohol and drug withdrawal, or CNS infections). In tramadol overdose, naloxone administration may increase the risk of seizure.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

The workup of a patient with cirrhosis and chronic pain should begin with a comprehensive history and physical. The clinical history should evaluate the location, quality, and severity of the pain, as well as functional interference; associated symptoms, including fatigue, sleep difficulty, mood disturbance, and cognitive difficulties; additional sensory sensitivity (e.g. sensitivity to light or sound); and symptoms in other body systems unrelated to the site of pain. In addition to patient history, questionnaires can be useful to evaluate pain location, as well as pain mechanism. For instance, a body map can be useful to assess pain widespreadedness, with multisite pain indicating a greater likelihood of nociplastic pain. The contribution of nociplastic pain can be further assessed using the 2016 Fibromyalgia Survey Criteria. The contribution of neuropathic pain can be assessed using the Neuropathic Pain Questionnaireor painDETECT, for example. Physical examination can be useful to identify possible pain generators or sources of nociceptive pain.

In general, the treatment of any type of chronic pain should begin with self‐directed nonpharmacologic interventions, as well as the improvement of associated symptoms and treatment of comorbid psychiatric disorders. The efficacy of any class of analgesic for chronic pain is small to modest, improving symptoms in approximately one of three patients who try them. Opioids are largely ineffective in treating chronic pain, especially nociplastic pain, which can be exacerbated by opioid use. Paired with the significant risks of analgesic use in patients with cirrhosis, the risk/benefit ratio is far greater for pharmacologic therapies than nonpharmacologic options in this population; thus, the goal should be to engage patients in actively pursuing these complementary therapies. A recent study to develop a pain self‐management intervention for patients with cirrhosis found that participants were highly motivated to pursue nonpharmacologic pain treatments; however, participants cited a lack of simple, evidence‐based therapies as a barrier to implementation. In addition to further research on self‐management programs, such as PainGuide,–that can be readily accessed by patients at home, a helpful strategy can be to produce a list of self‐directed nonpharmacologic therapies available to treat chronic pain, including exercise, diet modification, and sleep hygiene. The patient should be counseled to choose the interventions they wish to try, with reinforcement from the physician of the import of self‐directed management.

Liver failure

Deciding analgesic therapy for patients with hepatic impairment can be a challenge, since most analgesics undergo hepatic metabolism. Cirrhosis is the most prevalent manifestation of liver disease, and it may be caused due to excessive alcohol intake, hepatitis infection or drug-induced toxicity. Since liver is the main site of metabolism for paracetamol, NSAIDs and opioids such as morphine, its dysfunction may lead to increased blood levels of these drugs, particularly those that are primarily metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes. On the contrary, changes in CYP enzymes may result in decreased efficacy of codeine and tramadol, which undergo biotransformation to active metabolites. Thus, a thorough understanding of the pharmacokinetic profile of analgesics may help in deciding the appropriate pharmacotherapy for patients with liver dysfunction. For instance, although paracetamol undergoes metabolic conversion to a hepatotoxic metabolite N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine, clinically significant toxicity is observed only at large doses, and small doses of this drug may appear to be safe in such patients. Dose adjustment should be considered while administering NSAIDs and opioids to patients with hepatic impairment.

Disease-specific treatment recommendations are presented in the Supplementary materials section.

5.8 Opioid-Induced Hyperalgesia and Allodynia

Opioid-Induced Hyperalgesia (OIH) occurs when an opioid analgesic paradoxically causes an increase in pain, or an increase in sensitivity to pain. This condition differs from tolerance, which is the need for increasing doses of opioids to maintain a defined effect [see Dependence (9.3)]. Symptoms of OIH include (but may not be limited to) increased levels of pain upon opioid dosage increase, decreased levels of pain upon opioid dosage decrease, or pain from ordinarily non-painful stimuli (allodynia). These symptoms may suggest OIH only if there is no evidence of underlying disease progression, opioid tolerance, opioid withdrawal, or addictive behavior.

Cases of OIH have been reported, both with short-term and longer-term use of opioid analgesics. Though the mechanism of OIH is not fully understood, multiple biochemical pathways have been implicated. Medical literature suggests a strong biologic plausibility between opioid analgesics and OIH and allodynia. If a patient is suspected to be experiencing OIH, carefully consider appropriately decreasing the dose of the current opioid analgesic, or opioid rotation (safely switching the patient to a different opioid moiety) [see Dosage and Administration (2.5); Warnings and Precautions (5.21)].

5.9 Hepatotoxicity

Tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets contains tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen. Acetaminophen has been associated with cases of acute liver failure, at times resulting in liver transplant and death. Most of the cases of liver injury are associated with the use of acetaminophen at doses that exceed 4,000 milligrams per day, and often involve more than one acetaminophen-containing product. The excessive intake of acetaminophen may be intentional to cause self-harm or unintentional as patients attempt to obtain more pain relief or unknowingly take other acetaminophen-containing products.

The risk of acute liver failure is higher in individuals with underlying liver disease and in individuals who ingest alcohol while taking acetaminophen.

Instruct patients to look for acetaminophen or APAP on package labels and not to use more than one product that contains acetaminophen. Instruct patients to seek medical attention immediately upon ingestion of more than 4,000 milligrams of acetaminophen per day, even if they feel well.

### Tramadol hydrochloride (Conzip) [^113X1BBX]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

Distribution

The volume of distribution of tramadol was 2.6 and 2.9 liters/kg in male and female subjects, respectively, following a 100 mg intravenous tramadol dose. The binding of tramadol to human plasma proteins is approximately 20% and binding also appears to be independent of concentration up to 10 mcg/mL. Saturation of plasma protein binding occurs only at concentrations outside the clinically relevant range.

Elimination

Tramadol is eliminated primarily through metabolism by the liver and the metabolites are eliminated primarily by the kidneys. The mean plasma elimination half-lives of racemic tramadol and racemic M1 after administration of CONZIP capsules are approximately 10 and 11 hours, respectively.

Metabolism

Tramadol is extensively metabolized after oral administration. The major metabolic pathways appear to be N- (mediated by CYP3A4 and CYP2B6) and O- (mediated by CYP2D6) demethylation and glucuronidation or sulfation in the liver. One metabolite (O-desmethyltramadol, denoted M1) is pharmacologically active in animal models. Formation of M1 is dependent on CYP2D6 and as such is subject to inhibition and polymorphism, which may affect the therapeutic response [see Drug Interactions (7)].

Excretion

Approximately 30% of the dose is excreted in the urine as unchanged drug, whereas 60% of the dose is excreted as metabolites. The remainder is excreted either as unidentified or as unextractable metabolites.

Hepatic Impairment

Pharmacokinetics of tramadol was studied in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment after receiving multiple doses of an extended-release tramadol product at 100 mg. The exposure of (+)- and (-)-tramadol was similar in mild and moderate hepatic impairment patients in comparison to patients with normal hepatic function. However, exposure of (+)- and (-)-M1 decreased ~50% with increased severity of the hepatic impairment (from normal to mild and moderate). The pharmacokinetics of tramadol has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment. After the administration of tramadol immediate-release tablets to patients with advanced cirrhosis of the liver, tramadol area under the plasma concentration time curve was larger and the tramadol and M1 half-lives were longer than subjects with normal hepatic function. The limited availability of dose strengths of CONZIP does not permit the dosing flexibility required for safe use in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Therefore, CONZIP should not be used in patients with severe hepatic impairment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

8.5 Geriatric Use

A total of 455 elderly (65 years of age or older) subjects were exposed to tramadol hydrochloride tablets in controlled clinical trials. Of those, 145 subjects were 75 years of age and older.

In studies including geriatric patients, treatment-limiting adverse events were higher in subjects over 75 years of age compared to those under 65 years of age. Specifically, 30% of those over 75 years of age had gastrointestinal treatment-limiting adverse events compared to 17% of those under 65 years of age. Constipation resulted in discontinuation of treatment in 10% of those over 75.

Respiratory depression is the chief risk for elderly patients treated with opioids, and has occurred after large initial doses were administered to patients who were not opioid-tolerant or when opioids were co-administered with other agents that depress respiration. Titrate the dosage of tramadol hydrochloride tablets slowly in geriatric patients starting at the low end of the dosing range and monitor closely for signs of central nervous system and respiratory depression [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12)].

Tramadol is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function.

8.6 Renal and Hepatic Impairment

Impaired renal function results in a decreased rate and extent of excretion of tramadol and its active metabolite, M1. In patients with creatinine clearances of less than 30 mL/min, dosing reduction is recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. Metabolism of tramadol and M1 is reduced in patients with severe hepatic impairment based on a study in patients with advanced cirrhosis of the liver. In patients with severe hepatic impairment, dosing reduction is recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

With the prolonged half-life in these conditions, achievement of steady-state is delayed, so that it may take several days for elevated plasma concentrations to develop.

Pharmacologic therapy can be used as an adjunct or to address comorbid symptoms in the general population; however, options are very limited in patients with cirrhosis and are associated with adverse effects. Topical NSAIDs, such as diclofenac gel, or acetaminophen (500 mg every 6 h, maximum dose of 2 g per day) can be used for nociceptive pain. If necessary, opioids can be used in the short term for acute pain (e.g. hydromorphone 1 mg every 6 h as needed; oxycodone 2.5 mg by mouth every 6–8 h as needed; or fentanyl patch in select patients).TCAs (e.g. nortriptyline 10 mg nightly) can be used with caution for multiple symptoms, as well as neuropathic pain. Low‐dose SNRIs can be used for neuropathic pain or to relieve associated depression or fatigue with a small risk of hepatotoxicity. Gabapentin at low starting doses (e.g. 300 mg per day) or pregabalin (e.g. 50 mg twice per day) can relieve neuropathic pain or associated sleep difficulties or anxiety. Lidocaine patches can be used for peripheral neuropathic pain or postherpetic neuralgia. Topical capsaicin can also be used for peripheral neuropathic pain.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Elderly patients (65 years of age or older) may have increased sensitivity to tramadol. In general, use caution when selecting a dosage for an elderly patient, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.

Respiratory depression is the chief risk for elderly patients treated with opioids, and has occurred after large initial doses were administered to patients who were not opioid-tolerant or when opioids were co-administered with other agents that depress respiration. Titrate the dosage of tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets slowly in geriatric patients and frequently reevaluate the patient for signs of central nervous system and respiratory depression [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Tramadol and acetaminophen are known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function.

8.6 Hepatic Impairment

The pharmacokinetics and tolerability of tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets in patients with impaired hepatic function have not been studied. Based on information using tramadol immediate-release tablets in subjects with advanced cirrhosis of the liver, tramadol exposure was higher and half-lives of tramadol and active metabolite M1 were longer than in subjects with normal hepatic function [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

As tramadol and acetaminophen are both extensively metabolized by the liver, the use of tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets in patients with hepatic impairment is not recommended [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)].

8.7 Renal Impairment

The pharmacokinetics and tolerability of tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets in patients with renal impairment has not been studied. Based on studies using tramadol extended-release tablets, the excretion of tramadol and metabolite M1 is reduced in patients with creatinine clearance of less than 30 mL/min. In patients with creatinine clearances of less than 30 mL/min, it is recommended that the dosage of tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets not exceed 2 tablets every 12 hours [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. The total amount of tramadol and M1 removed during a 4 hour dialysis period is less than 7% of the administered dose based on studies using tramadol alone. Monitor closely for signs of respiratory depression, sedation, and hypotension.

Structural MRI studies show differences in gray matter volume for pain processing regions in individuals with chronic pain. Functional MRI data show increased neural connectivity in pain processing regions associated with clinical painand decreased connectivity following successful pain treatment. In addition, proton MRI spectroscopy shows increased excitatory and decreased inhibitory neurotransmitter levels in pain processing regions associated with chronic pain. Taken together, these results suggest that CNS dysfunction is an important mechanistic driver of pain pathophysiology.

Although chronic pain conditions can involve an interplay of nociceptive, neuropathic, and nociplastic elements, identifying patients who may have higher degrees of nociplastic pain is helpful for treatment purposes, especially in cirrhosis, in which appropriate analgesic use is a complex decision. In general, nonpharmacologic therapies (e.g. exercise, psychological therapies, integrative therapies) are emphasized for the treatment of nociplastic pain, as oral analgesics are of limited efficacy in chronic pain, generally, and opioids may make pain in conditions such as FM worse through opioid‐induced hyperalgesia. Nociplastic pain conditions are also associated with increased sensitivity to medications and related adverse effects. Furthermore, the comorbid symptoms associated with nociplastic pain provide additional treatment targets.

Using what is known about the clinical features, diagnostic methods, and first‐line treatments of nociceptive, neuropathic, and nociplastic pain conditions, generally, we can provide a framework for applying these principles to patients with cirrhosis, highlighting considerations specific to liver pathology.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug harms in cirrhosis — "NSAIDs are among the most commonly inappropriately used medications in patients with cirrhosis", yet "Multiple studies demonstrate the deleterious impact of NSAIDs in patients with cirrhosis attributable to risk of renal injury, bleeding, and ascites". In one trial, "23 patients with cirrhosis" receiving "five doses of 500 mg of naproxen (vs. placebo or celecoxib)" had adverse physiologic effects, and consequently "systemic NSAIDs should be avoided in patients with cirrhosis". Patients should also be informed that other products "may include APAP, which counts toward the daily limit".

### Improving clinical suspicion of acute mesenteric ischemia among patients with acute abdomen: a cross-sectional study from an intestinal stroke center [^114rKcHn]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Data collection and processing

Routine baseline clinical and biological characteristics were prospectively collected upon admission for all patients: age, gender, history of cardiovascular disease, atherosclerosis risk factors (i.e. tobacco consumption, high blood pressure, diabetes mellitus, or elevated cholesterol or triglycerides), history of venous thromboembolism, history of chronic kidney disease, cirrhosis, ischemic colitis, or abdominal surgery. In addition, the following data concerning AMI was collected: clinical signs at presentation (characteristics of acute abdominal pain, including sudden onset or a requirement for morphine (or other strong opioids), gastrointestinal bleeding, diarrhea, vomiting, constipation, abdominal guarding, sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score, and laboratory test values at presentation (white blood cell [WBC], neutrophil, lymphocyte, and platelet counts, the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio [NLR], and hemoglobin, and plasma C-reactive protein [CRP], procalcitonin,-lactate, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, aspartate aminotransferase, and bilirubin levels). Morphine-requiring abdominal pain was defined as a pain unrelieved by weak opioids (such as tramadol or codeine) and relieved by > 2 mg intravenous morphine (or equivalent). Pain relief was defined as ≤ 30/100 mm on the visual analogue pain scale. The sudden-onset was defined by an abdominal pain that started and peaked within an hour or less. The origin of AMI (arterial–thrombotic or embolic–venous, or non-occlusive) was specified based on the patient records, CT scan, and pathological review.

### Contemporary management of pain in cirrhosis: toward precision therapy for pain [^112beYqC]. Hepatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Treatment

The treatment of nociceptive pain generally involves analgesics or interventions directed at the pain source (e.g. surgery to decompress nerves, intra‐articular injections). Common analgesics, such as acetaminophen, NSAIDs (topical and oral), and opioids, are used. Topical NSAIDs treat musculoskeletal injuries with low risk. Oral NSAIDs in patients without portal hypertension, acetaminophen, or both are first‐line treatments for mild to moderate pain, based on individual patient risk factors. Muscle relaxants can be used to relieve acute low back and neck pain. Opioids, such as oxycodone or hydrocodone, may be used for acute pain that is severe or unresponsive to initial therapies; however, the recommended usage is for no more than three days given the risks of adverse effects, including complex dependency or even addiction. First‐line medications should be continued during this period.

In light of the potential for chronic pain to be mixed, as well as for peripheral nociceptive input to lead to central sensitization and nociplastic pain, the first‐line self‐directed nonpharmacologic, noninterventional therapies recommended for nociplastic pain may also be useful in patients who appear to have primarily nociceptive pain. Beginning with these treatments before considering pharmacologic agents or other interventions also aligns with the stepped method recommended for addressing chronic pain, generally.

### Contemporary management of pain in cirrhosis: toward precision therapy for pain [^112qSM4E]. Hepatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Classic analgesic therapy is of limited efficacy for nociplastic pain, although NSAIDs and acetaminophen may be helpful for relieving peripheral pain that could presumably be contributing to central sensitization. Low‐dose tricyclic compounds (e.g. low‐dose cyclobenzaprine 5–20 mg at bedtime) are first‐line and can relieve multiple symptoms. Otherwise, pharmacologic therapy should generally target symptoms comorbid with pain. For instance, serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) (e.g. duloxetine at 30 mg daily) can relieve depression or fatigue, and gabapentinoids can relieve difficulties with sleep or anxiety.–Overall, individualized multimodal therapy should be emphasized.

Despite the risks of analgesic therapies, patients with cirrhosis and their physicians are often afraid to stop opioids and gabapentin. In a qualitative study of semistructured interviews with patients with cirrhosis on opioids and their clinicians, both cited their belief that nonpharmacologic interventions for pain were unproven as the key reason for continuing risky medications. This thinking is erroneous given that no intervention for pain offers more than modest relief for most patients; however, medications tend to have far greater adverse events than do the nonpharmacologic approaches for comparable effect sizes. Greater need for education on the merits of nonpharmacologic approaches is needed, as is additional research on implementation of these therapies, including digital self‐management programs.

### The use of opioids in the management of chronic pain: synopsis of the 2022 updated U.S. department of veterans affairs and U.S. department of defense clinical practice guideline [^114xUkjz]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Short-acting, orally administered opioids — codeine (alone or in combination with APAP or ASA) — initial oral dosing in opioid-naïve adults is 15 to 30 mg every 4 to 6 hr, and for combination products the Maximum APAP dose: 4000 mg/d (2000 mg/d in chronic alcoholics or in hepatic impairment). Pharmacokinetics are Analgesic Onset (min): 15 to 30, Peak (min): 30 to 60, Duration (hr): 4 to 6, and t½ (hr): ~3. In special populations: Elderly or debilitated: Use with caution; Hepatic dysfunction: Conversion to active metabolite (morphine) may be reduced in patients with cirrhosis; avoid use in patients with liver disease; and Renal dysfunction: Use lower dosage or an alternative analgesic. Other considerations note that Codeine may be less effective in patients with decreased CYP-2D6 activity (due to poor CYP-2D6 metabolism or CYP-2D6 inhibiting drugs) because of decreased conversion to the active metabolite, morphine, and that CYP-2D6 ultra-rapid metabolizers can have extensive conversion to morphine with increase in opioid-mediated effects.

### Pain management after open liver resection: procedure-specific postoperative pain management (PROSPECT) recommendations [^114nrri3]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

The risk of spinal hematoma after epidural analgesia remains a matter of debate. After liver resection, coagulation disorders may develop, leading to concerns regarding the safety of removing the epidural catheter. The most important identified factors to predict hemostatic alterations are the preoperative liver dysfunction, the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score, and the extent and mass of resected liver tissue. Nevertheless, we note that one RCT investigating TEAwas carried out in child A cirrhotic patients who do not show an alteration in basic coagulation tests. Of note, in patients with liver disease, an elevated INR does not necessarily predict an increased risk of bleeding. Indeed, the complex interplay of fluctuating procoagulants and anticoagulants leads often and paradoxically to a prothrombotic state. Nevertheless, caution should be exercised and the benefits versus harm must be carefully evaluated in this particular population. Yet, for a large number of hepatic resections and especially in the case of living donation or resection of metastases in healthy patients, TEA seems safe.

Another concern of TEA includes delayed ambulation due to orthostatic hypotension or cumbersome equipment. However, some evidence suggests that TEA can be integrated into ERAS pathways, and its effects on attenuating the stress response to surgery and reducing postoperative pain may outweigh the other limitations. A recent study reported reduced risk of respiratory complications and shorter hospital LOS in patients receiving TEA. Furthermore, TEA allows opioid-sparing and improves gastrointestinal function. Also, TEA may reduce intraoperative blood loss, given the associated sympathetic blockade and vasodilatation which may reduce central venous pressure. Nevertheless, in order to attain enhanced recovery with TEA, it is imperative that the level of insertion of the epidural catheter (mid-thoracic) and the doses of local anesthetics must be carefully chosen so as to adequately cover the surgical incision site without causing motor blockade. Thus, the benefits of TEA may be achieved when used intraoperatively as well as postoperatively, as practiced in five included RCTs.

### AASLD practice guidance: palliative care and symptom-based management in decompensated cirrhosis [^112kknEF]. Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

AASLD decompensated cirrhosis — pain management emphasizes that acute pain (≤ 12 weeks) is more responsive to short-term opioid therapy than chronic pain, and optimal chronic pain management often involves multimodal, nonpharmacological approaches, including behavioral management, physical therapy, and procedural approaches. Behavioral approaches have not been specifically evaluated in patients with cirrhosis, but pain self-management programs, cognitive behavioral therapy, and physical and occupational therapy are safe and efficacious in other populations for the management of chronic pain. Procedural approaches have been largely untested in cirrhosis, but acupuncture is effective for chronic musculoskeletal pain and headache in general populations, and although there are no direct data about safety of acupuncture in patients with cirrhosis, observational studies of drug-related thrombocytopenia indicate that acupuncture is likely safe in patients with platelets > 50,000/mL, with a review evaluating potential benefits. Similarly, injections can be used for limited indications, such as knee osteoarthritis, though physical therapy remains first line. Because of impaired hepatic metabolism and the risk of precipitating encephalopathy, lower doses and less systemic therapies are generally preferred for pharmacological management of chronic pain in patients with cirrhosis. Local pharmacotherapies are generally first line for localized pain, and lidocaine patches and topical creams for localized neuropathic (e.g., capsaicin) and musculoskeletal pain (e.g., topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]) are effective and have limited systemic absorption, rendering them likely safe (though untested) in persons with cirrhosis. Acetaminophen (APAP) dosing is described as up to 2 g daily (typically prescribed as 500 mg, every 6 hours, as needed).

### Toward a systematic approach to opioid rotation [^115KAVB8]. Journal of Pain Research (2014). Low credibility.

Hepatic and renal impairment

Additional considerations for opioid rotation include the effects of hepatic and renal impairment on opioid dosing recommendations (Table 2). The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends assessment of hepatic function based on Child-Pugh ratings (mild, moderate, severe)and defines moderate and severe renal impairment as a creatinine clearance of 30–50 mL/minute and < 30 mL/minute, respectively. Many opioid drugs undergo hepatic phase I metabolism mediated by the CYP mono-oxygenases (primarily CYP3A4 and CYP2D6), enzymes that produce both active and inactive metabolites that vary among commonly used opioid agents (Table 3). Moreover, metabolism of opioids by CYP3A4 produces major metabolites of certain opioids that exhibit > 30-fold higher (eg, hydrocodone produces norhydrocodone) and lower (eg, buprenorphine produces norbuprenorphine) affinity for the μ-opioid receptor. Thus, for patients with hepatic or renal impairment undergoing pain management with opioid A, clinicians may consider the following guidance: 1) dose adjustments are required or recommended with a number of opioids, including morphine, oxycodone, oxymorphone, and hydromorphone in patients with renal impairment;,2) patients with renal impairment may be rotated to fentanyl or buprenorphine, which are less affected by renal impairment;,3) tapentadol, tramadol, and methadone should be administered with great caution in patients with severe hepatic or renal impairment;, and 4) consider rotation to fentanyl in patients with hepatic impairment, which appear not to alter levels of this opioid.

Short-acting opioids — tramadol dosing and precautions include: initial oral dosage (in opioid-naïve) is 25 mg every morning; titration may increase by 25 mg per day every 3 days to 100 mg tramadol/d (25 mg every 6 hr), with subsequent increments of 50 mg/d every 3 days to 200 mg/d (50 mg every 6 hr), after which 50 to 100 mg may be given every 4 to 6 hr; maximum daily dose of tramadol is 400 mg/d, and for the combination product the maximum is 4000 mg/d APAP with 2000 mg/d APAP in chronic alcoholics or in hepatic impairment. Analgesic timing is stated as Analgesic Onset (min): < 60, Peak (min): ~120 to 180, Duration (hr): 6, and t½ (hr): 6.3 ± 1.4. In special populations, in elderly patients > 75 years give < 300 mg/d in divided doses and use caution in debilitated patients; in hepatic dysfunction decrease dosage to 50 mg once every 12 hr in patients with cirrhosis; in renal dysfunction CrCl > 30 ml/min requires no change in dose or frequency, whereas CrCl < 30 ml/min requires increasing the dosing interval to 12 hr and decreasing maximum daily dose to 200 mg; dialysis patients can receive their regular dose on the day of dialysis (< 7% of a dose is removed by hemodialysis). Other considerations note that tramadol inhibits reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine and concomitant use with MAOIS SSRIs may increase risk of seizures, serotonin syndrome; dose carefully or use another agent in patients on serotonergic agents; seizures are reported within the recommended dosage range, with increased risk above the recommended dosage range and in patient with seizure disorder, history of seizures, in conditions with increased risk of seizures, or with other drugs that increase seizure risk; observe maximum dose limits.

### The use of opioids in the management of chronic pain: synopsis of the 2022 updated U.S. department of veterans affairs and U.S. department of defense clinical practice guideline [^112kFuNT]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Short-acting opioids — morphine: Initial oral dosage (in opioid-naïve) is 10 to 30 mg every 4 hr. There is no optimal or maximum dose of morphine; patients on LOT are likely to become tolerant and require doses higher than the usual dosage range to maintain the desired effect. Timing parameters are Analgesic Onset (min): 30, Peak (min): 60, Duration (hr): 3 to 5, and t½ (hr): 2 to 4 in adults. In special populations, for the elderly or debilitated give with extreme caution and use a lower dose; for hepatic dysfunction use carefully in patients with cirrhosis and consider reducing dose or extending dosing interval by 1.5 to 2 times, noting half-life may be doubled (3 to 4 hr) and bioavailability is increased; and for renal dysfunction reduce dose or, if severe renal impairment exists, avoid use. Other considerations include that M6G, an active metabolite, may accumulate in renal impairment, and M3G, a metabolite without analgesic activity, may accumulate in renal impairment and has been implicated in morphine-induced neurotoxicity, hyperalgesia, and allodynia.

### Tramadol hydrochloride (tramadol HCl) [^115gw1on]. FDA (2007). Low credibility.

Acute Abdominal Conditions

The administration of tramadol hydrochloride may complicate the clinical assessment of patients with acute abdominal conditions.

Use in Renal and Hepatic Disease

Impaired renal function results in a decreased rate and extent of excretion of tramadol and its active metabolite, M1. In patients with creatinine clearances of less than 30 mL/min, dosing reduction is recommended (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Metabolism of tramadol and M1 is reduced in patients with advanced cirrhosis of the liver. In cirrhotic patients, dosing reduction is recommended (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

With the prolonged half-life in these conditions, achievement of steady-state is delayed, so that it may take several days for elevated plasma concentrations to develop.

Drug Interactions

In vitro studies indicate that tramadol is unlikely to inhibit the CYP3A4-mediated metabolism of other drugs when tramadol is administered concomitantly at therapeutic doses. Tramadol does not appear to induce its own metabolism in humans, since observed maximal plasma concentrations after multiple oral doses are higher than expected based on single-dose data. Tramadol is a mild inducer of selected drug metabolism pathways measured in animals.

Use with Carbamazepine

Patients taking carbamazepine may have a significantly reduced analgesic effect of tramadol hydrochloride. Because carbamazepine increases tramadol metabolism and because of the seizure risk associated with tramadol, concomitant administration of tramadol hydrochloride and carbamazepine is not recommended.

Use with Quinidine

Tramadol is metabolized to M1 by the CYP2D6. Quinidine is a selective inhibitor of that isoenzyme, so that concomitant administration of quinidine and tramadol hydrochloride results in increased concentrations of tramadol and reduced concentrations of M1. The clinical consequences of these findings are unknown. In vitro drug interaction studies in human liver microsomes indicate that tramadol has no effect on quinidine metabolism.

Use with Inhibitors of CYP2D6

In vitro drug interaction studies in human liver microsomes indicate that concomitant administration with inhibitors of CYP2D6 such as fluoxetine, paroxetine, and amitriptyline could result in some inhibition of the metabolism of tramadol.

Use with Cimetidine

Concomitant administration of tramadol hydrochloride with cimetidine does not result in clinically significant changes in tramadol pharmacokinetics. Therefore, no alteration of the tramadol hydrochloride dosage regimen is recommended.

Use with MAO Inhibitors

Interactions with MAO inhibitors, due to interference with detoxification mechanisms, have been reported for some centrally acting drugs (see WARNINGS, Use with MAO Inhibitors).

Use with Digoxin and Warfarin

Post-marketing surveillance has revealed rare reports of digoxin toxicity and alteration of warfarin effect, including elevation of pro-thrombin times.

### Contemporary management of pain in cirrhosis: toward precision therapy for pain [^1175Lgav]. Hepatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Considerations in cirrhosis

NSAIDs are metabolized by the liver and are largely protein‐bound, leading to elevated serum levels in patients with cirrhosis. Furthermore, NSAIDs inhibit prostaglandins, leading to decreased renal perfusion and increased risk of hepatorenal syndrome.NSAIDs also inhibit thromboxane A2 production, increasing bleeding risk. Given these risks, oral NSAIDs are contraindicated in cirrhosis. Topical NSAIDs, such as diclofenac gel, have not been researched in patients with cirrhosis; however, their use is generally accepted because the level of systemic absorption is low. Acetaminophen, although associated with hepatotoxicity when taken in excessive doses, can be used in patients with cirrhosis up to 2 g per day (500 mg every 6 h). Muscle relaxants (e.g. cyclobenzaprine, methocarbamol) are associated with sedation and should be avoided in older individuals; however their use in cirrhosis has not been studied. Opioids are primarily metabolized by the liver and are associated with unique risks in cirrhosis, including altered pharmacokinetics (i.e. prolonged half‐lives), HE, and risk of addiction in a population with a higher rate of alcoholism. However, opioids can be started if needed, for instance hydromorphone (1 mg every 6 h as needed) or oxycodone (2.5 mg by mouth every 6–8 h as needed). A fentanyl patch (12 mcg starting dose) can be used in patients without sarcopenia/cachexia or fever.

OPPORTUNITIES IN THE MANAGEMENT OF CHRONIC PAIN

Pain management is moving toward a precision approach based on the type of pain a patient is experiencing (Figure 2). This is especially true in the setting of central sensitization or nociplastic pain, for which the effective treatments are different than those used to treat nociceptive pain. There are limited data mapping the types of chronic pain that individuals with cirrhosis might experience and to consider the concept of nociplastic pain or "central sensitization" in addition to pain from tissue damage (nociceptive) or nerve damage (neuropathic). Patients with cirrhosis have a disproportionately high burden of nociceptive pain (e.g. fractures, abdominal distension, muscle cramping)and neuropathic pain (e.g. peripheral neuropathy),–as well as an unknown prevalence of nociplastic pain (e.g. disorders of the brain–gut interaction). However, it is likely that nociplastic pain contributes to the burden of chronic pain in patients with cirrhosis given that multiple common conditions, such as low back pain and osteoarthritis, can be considered "mixed pain" states, in that they can have nociceptive, neuropathic, and/or nociplastic elements. Furthermore, continuous nociceptive pain states (e.g. arthritis, cancer) can lead to nociplastic pain.

FIGURE 2
Algorithm for the treatment of chronic pain based on mechanism. Summary of recommendations for the evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment of chronic pain in patients with cirrhosis, emphasizing nonpharmacologic therapies as first‐line treatment. BID, two times a day; PRN, as needed; q6, every six hours; qHS, every night at bedtime; NSAID, nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drug; SNRI, serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor; TCA, tricyclic antidepressant.

Optimal treatment for nociplastic pain contrasts with that for nociceptive pain, where therapy is generally peripherally directed (e.g. analgesics, opioids, injections), and instead involves an emphasis on nonpharmacologic therapies. Failure to select therapies for the mechanism of pain will result in suboptimal outcomes. Accordingly, there is a pressing need to apply tools to identify nociplastic pain in cirrhosis and develop interventions to address it.

### Review of extended-release formulations of tramadol for the management of chronic non-cancer pain: focus on marketed formulations [^113HQXSf]. Journal of Pain Research (2014). Low credibility.

Although NSAIDs may be helpful with pain flares, it is recommended in most cases that they should not be used chronically on a daily basis given their associated significant side effects, including end-stage renal disease in two out of every 1,000 patients who use them daily for 5 years or more. The use of analgesic combination products is also associated with significant side effects. Chronic use of NSAIDS, aspirin, or acetaminophen is found be associated with hepatotoxicity, coagulopathy, end-stage renal disease, and death. Ulcer formation occurs in 2%–4% of chronic NSAID users every year.NSAIDs have also been associated with reducing the effectiveness of some antihypertensives (beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and diuretics) and increasing the effect of sulfonylureas when used in conjunction with these drugs.
