## Question

do COCs contribute to heart issues

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether combined oral contraceptives (COCs) contribute to heart issues. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "heart issues" encompass in this context. Then, I should verify the strength and consistency of evidence for arterial events like myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke. Next, I will examine venous thromboembolism risk, since that is a major cardiovascular safety signal. After that, I need to quantify absolute versus relative risk and identify key modifiers such as age, smoking, hypertension, estrogen dose, and progestin type. Finally, I should align this with guideline-based eligibility criteria and translate this into practical counseling and alternatives for higher-risk patients.

> Let me first confirm the scope of "heart issues". In contraceptive safety literature, this primarily refers to arterial thrombotic events (myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke) and venous thromboembolism (deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism), with additional consideration of effects on blood pressure and lipid metabolism that may indirectly influence cardiovascular risk, so I should keep all of these in view as I proceed.

> Now, I should verify the evidence for arterial events. Multiple high-quality syntheses show a modest increase in risk of MI and ischemic stroke with current COC use, on the order of roughly 1.6–2.0-fold in population-level analyses, with risk appearing higher with higher estrogen doses and in the presence of additional risk factors; importantly, progestin generation does not consistently modify arterial risk in these pooled analyses, which I need to remember when counseling about brand differences [^113GEGAN] [^111nxPFF] [^113ZJw2f].

> Wait, let me verify the dose-response point because it matters clinically. The Cochrane review indicates risk rises with estrogen dose, with the clearest signal above 50 micrograms of ethinyl estradiol, and suggests that levonorgestrel with 30 micrograms may be among the safer oral options, though absolute differences are small and confounding remains a limitation in observational designs; still, this supports using the lowest effective estrogen dose when COCs are appropriate [^113GEGAN].

> Next, I should review venous thromboembolism risk, since that is the most consistently elevated cardiovascular risk with COCs. Current COC use approximately doubles VTE risk compared with nonusers, with the highest risk in the first year of use and with substantial heterogeneity by progestin; third-generation progestins such as desogestrel and drospirenone are associated with higher VTE risk than levonorgestrel, and obesity compounds this risk multiplicatively, which I need to emphasize during shared decision-making [^115bbbqY] [^116p1wmd].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about absolute risk without context. In healthy reproductive-age women, the baseline risk of arterial events is very low, so a 1.6–2.0-fold relative increase translates to small absolute excesses, on the order of about 10 additional MIs and 21 additional ischemic strokes per 100,000 woman-years; this helps frame risk-benefit discussions, especially when compared with the risks of unintended pregnancy and its cardiovascular complications [^113D4bNr].

> I need to check the major risk modifiers that amplify COC-related cardiovascular risk. Age over 35, cigarette smoking, hypertension, diabetes, obesity, and migraine with aura each independently increase risk, and their effects are synergistic with COCs; notably, smoking plus COC use drives a marked increase in MI risk, and hypertension interacts multiplicatively with COCs for both MI and stroke, which is why guidelines restrict or contraindicate COCs in these settings [^113EPmWG] [^112a6VCd] [^114DhMsQ].

> Let me consider estrogen dose and formulation nuances. Higher ethinyl estradiol doses clearly increase arterial and venous risks, whereas modern low-dose formulations (generally 20–35 micrograms) reduce but do not eliminate excess risk; observational data suggest estradiol-based COCs may have a more neutral blood pressure profile in normotensive users, but robust outcome data are limited, so I should be cautious about overpromising safety advantages for estradiol-based pills at this time [^113GEGAN] [^111gwWLj].

> I should confirm progestin-specific issues. For arterial events, progestin generation has not consistently altered MI or ischemic stroke risk in pooled analyses, whereas for VTE, newer progestins like desogestrel and drospirenone carry higher risk than levonorgestrel; this distinction is important when selecting among COCs for patients without contraindications who prefer this method [^113GEGAN].

> Next, I should review guideline-based eligibility to ensure my counseling aligns with best practice. The U.S. MEC places severe hypertension, ischemic heart disease, stroke, and multiple major cardiovascular risk factors as category 4 (do not use) or 3 (generally do not use) for CHCs, and mandates blood pressure measurement before initiation; smoking over age 35 is category 4, and even controlled hypertension warrants careful monitoring and shared decision-making given additive risk [^1144uQFn] [^112gZ4gP] [^112a6VCd].

> But wait, what if the patient has PCOS or dyslipidemia. I should double-check that PCOS itself confers a modestly elevated baseline cardiovascular risk, and COCs can both improve menstrual and androgen symptoms and potentially worsen some metabolic parameters depending on the progestin; thus, individualized risk stratification and management of cardiometabolic factors are essential, and natural estrogen or lower-androgenic progestin options may be reasonable when COCs are otherwise acceptable [^111myZ3G] [^114SDtFX].

> I will now examine safer alternatives for patients with higher cardiovascular risk or intolerance to estrogen. Progestin-only methods, including the pill, implant, and levonorgestrel IUD, are not associated with increased arterial thrombotic risk and have minimal or no effect on blood pressure, making them preferred in women with hypertension, smoking, migraine with aura, or multiple risk factors; I should also note that while some data suggest a possible small VTE signal with depot medroxyprogesterone acetate, the balance of evidence and guidelines still support its use when appropriate with individualized counseling [^113vpuiH] [^112B8NG6] [^111Mg6zK].

> Let me reconsider the practical counseling points to ensure nothing is missed. I should confirm blood pressure before starting any CHC, reassess blood pressure within 3 months, and screen for smoking, migraine with aura, diabetes, obesity, and lipid abnormalities; I should also advise that the excess risk is highest in the first year of use and declines after stopping, and I should document a shared decision-making conversation that weighs contraceptive efficacy and noncontraceptive benefits against small but real cardiovascular risks in the context of the patient's baseline risk profile [^112gZ4gP] [^11644TZL] [^115bbbqY].

> In summary, yes, COCs contribute to heart issues via a modest increase in arterial thrombotic events and a larger, dose- and progestin-related increase in venous thromboembolism; however, absolute risks are low in healthy young women, and careful selection, dose minimization, and avoidance in women with specific risk factors substantially mitigate harm while preserving the important benefits of effective contraception and symptom control [^113GEGAN] [^113D4bNr] [^113N3ryE].

Combined oral contraceptives (COCs) are associated with a **small but significant increase** in cardiovascular risk, particularly for venous thromboembolism (VTE) [^113N3ryE], ischemic stroke [^113GEGAN], and myocardial infarction (MI) [^111nxPFF], especially in women with additional risk factors such as age over 35, smoking, hypertension, obesity, diabetes, or migraine with aura [^1144uQFn] [^115Yruv2] [^116p1wmd]. The absolute risk remains low in healthy, young, non-smoking women [^113D4bNr], but **risk increases with age and cumulative exposure** [^115Yruv2] [^116uo4ps]. Modern low-dose formulations (≤ 35 µg ethinyl estradiol) have reduced but not eliminated this risk [^1166PB2z] [^113GEGAN]. Progestin-only methods are preferred for women with cardiovascular risk factors [^111Mg6zK] [^113vpuiH].

## Cardiovascular risks associated with COCs

### Venous thromboembolism (VTE)

- **Risk estimate**: COC users have a 2–4-fold increased VTE risk compared to nonusers, with an absolute risk of ~3–9 per 10,000 woman-years [^notfound].
- **Risk factors**: Higher with estrogen dose [^113dSn8E], progestin type (e.g. desogestrel, drospirenone) [^notfound], obesity, smoking, and inherited thrombophilias [^115bbbqY].
- **Dose-response**: Risk rises with estrogen dose; lowest with 20 µg, higher with 30–35 µg, and highest with ≥ 50 µg [^notfound].

---

### Arterial thrombosis (myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke)

- **Risk estimate**: COCs increase MI and ischemic stroke risk by ~1.5–2.0-fold, with absolute risks of ~2–8 per 100,000 woman-years [^113GEGAN].
- **Risk factors**: Stronger with age ≥ 35, smoking, hypertension, diabetes, obesity, and migraine with aura [^1144uQFn] [^115Yruv2].
- **Smoking**: Particularly increases MI risk; COCs are contraindicated in women ≥ 35 who smoke [^113EPmWG] [^116NvxmM].

---

## Influence of estrogen dose and progestin type

Lower estrogen doses (20–35 µg) reduce VTE and arterial thrombosis risk compared with higher doses (≥ 50 µg) [^113GEGAN]. Progestin type also matters: **levonorgestrel** is associated with lower VTE risk than newer progestins (e.g. desogestrel, drospirenone) [^notfound].

---

## Population-specific cardiovascular risks

| **Population** | **Cardiovascular risks** |
|-|-|
| Women ≥ 35 years | - Increased risk of MI, stroke, and VTE [^116tkLtp] [^115Yruv2] <br/> - Contraindicated if smoking [^113EPmWG] |
| Smokers | - Markedly increased MI and stroke risk [^113EPmWG] [^112QKfRm] <br/> - Contraindicated if ≥ 35 years [^1128656y] |
| Hypertensive women | - Increased risk of MI and stroke [^112a6VCd] [^116xxbP6] <br/> - Contraindicated if severe hypertension [^112gZ4gP] |
| Obese women | - Higher VTE risk [^116p1wmd] <br/> - Increased MI and stroke risk [^116p1wmd] |
| Women with migraine with aura | - Increased stroke risk [^115Yruv2] [^111VfgkZ] <br/> - Contraindicated [^notfound] |

---

## Long-term cardiovascular effects

Some observational data suggest a **persistent small increase** in cardiovascular risk after discontinuation, particularly with long-term or high-dose use, but evidence is limited and inconsistent [^116uo4ps] [^114kvZx7].

---

## Comparison with other hormonal contraceptives

Progestin-only methods (POPs, injectables, implants, IUDs) have **no significant increase** in MI or stroke risk and a lower VTE risk than COCs, making them preferred for women with cardiovascular risk factors [^113vpuiH] [^112B8NG6] [^111Mg6zK].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

- **Screening**: Measure blood pressure before initiating COCs; screen for cardiovascular risk factors [^115AMsK4] [^112gZ4gP].
- **Contraindications**: Severe hypertension, history of VTE, stroke, MI, migraine with aura, and smoking ≥ 35 years [^112a6VCd] [^116pDeex] [^113EPmWG] [^116tkLtp].
- **Alternative methods**: Prefer progestin-only or non-hormonal methods for women with cardiovascular risk factors [^111Mg6zK] [^116r9gFS].

---

## Clinical implications and counseling

Clinicians should **individualize counseling**, balancing contraceptive benefits against cardiovascular risks, especially in women with risk factors [^1144uQFn]. Regular monitoring of blood pressure, weight, and cardiovascular symptoms is essential during COC use [^11644TZL].

---

Combined oral contraceptives are associated with a **small but significant increase** in cardiovascular risk, particularly for VTE, ischemic stroke, and MI, with risk modulated by estrogen dose, progestin type, and patient factors such as age, smoking, hypertension, obesity, and migraine with aura [^113GEGAN] [^116tkLtp]. Modern low-dose formulations have reduced but not eliminated this risk, and progestin-only methods are preferred for women with cardiovascular risk factors [^115crVkP] [^111Mg6zK].

## References

### Cardiovascular risk and combined oral contraceptives: clinical decisions in settings of uncertainty [^116AZsqn]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2013). Low credibility.

Although generally safe, combined oral contraceptives (COCs) are associated with risks, including an estimated 2-fold increased relative risk of cardiovascular events. For most women taking COCs for contraception, absolute cardiovascular risks are very low, and the overall risks of COCs are outweighed by the risks of unwanted pregnancy. Nonetheless, risks of COCs may be excessive in some women, and both the American College of Obstetricians (ACOG) and the World Health Organization (WHO) have offered contraindications for COC use. Complicating this issue, COCs are commonly used for reasons other than contraception (eg, polycystic ovary syndrome, which is associated with subfertility and cardiovascular risk factors). Thus, in some clinical scenarios, ACOG and WHO guidelines may offer incomplete guidance regarding whether COC use would be associated with an unacceptable risk-benefit ratio. We propose that cardiovascular risk calculators may be helpful in some patients, as an adjunct to ACOG and WHO guidelines, by allowing physicians to estimate the attributable risk of COC-related cardiovascular events.

ESC/ESH 2018 — oral contraceptive pills and hypertension: Combined oestrogen–progestogen oral contraceptive pills can be associated with a small but significant increase in BP and the development of hypertension in about 5% of OC users. BP should be monitored before and during oral contraceptive pill treatment. Concomitant CV risk factors (e.g. smoking history) should be assessed and oral contraceptive pill use is not recommended if BP is elevated. Discontinuation of combined oestrogen–progestogen oral contraceptives in women with hypertension may improve their BP control.

### Sex and gender in hypertension guidelines [^114WZx1W]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2023). Medium credibility.

This guideline also addressed the issue that combined estrogen–progesterone oral contraceptive pills can be associated with a small but significant increase in BP and the development of hypertension in about 5% of users. BP usually decreases promptly following cessation of these pills; consequently, BP should be monitored before and during oral contraceptive treatment. The 2018 ESC/ESH guideline also acknowledges that older studies have demonstrated a relationship between oral contraceptive pills and venous thrombosis or thromboembolism and, to a lesser extent, myocardial infarction (especially with concomitant smoking history) and stroke. More recent studies with newer-generation oral contraceptive pills reported conflicting results. Thus, physicians prescribing oral contraceptives should consider the individual patient's risks and benefits. Finally, hormone-replacement therapy and selective estrogen receptor modulators should not be used for primary or secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease, while there is no convincing evidence for a significant BP rise in menopausal women due to hormone replacement therapy.

### The evolution of combined oral contraception: improving the risk-to-benefit ratio [^1166PB2z]. Contraception (2011). Low credibility.

Since its introduction in 1960, the combined oral contraceptive (COC) pill has become one of the most widely and frequently used methods of contraception worldwide. Although highly effective, early COC formulations were associated with significant adverse effects and unacceptable cardiovascular risk. Improvements in tolerability and safety have been achieved, without compromises in effectiveness, primarily via hormone dosage reductions and the development of several new progestins. Multiphasic COCs and extended-/continuous-cycle COCs have also been introduced, although the clinical advantages of these formulations vs. traditional COCs have yet to be established. Inclusion of natural estrogens such as estradiol valerate and 17β-estradiol with selective progestins in new combinations that maintain good cycle control is the most recent evolutionary step designed to improve COC tolerability and safety. Vigorous research needs to continue to help guarantee that the unmet need for safe and effective contraception is satisfied in future generations.

### U.S. medical eligibility criteria for contraceptive use, 2024 [^1144uQFn]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2024). High credibility.

Combined hormonal contraceptives (CHCs) — multiple risk factors for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease: When multiple major risk factors are present (e.g., older age, smoking, diabetes, hypertension, low HDL, high LDL, or high triglyceride levels), the CHC classification is 3/4. Clarification states that when a person has multiple major risk factors, use of CHCs might increase risk to an unacceptable level, but a simple addition of categories is not intended (e.g., two category 2 risk factors might not necessarily warrant a higher category).

### Association between the current use of low-dose oral contraceptives and cardiovascular arterial disease: a meta-analysis [^111nxPFF]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2005). Low credibility.

Context

The long-term cardiovascular safety of widely used oral contraceptives (OCs) is still debated, and no meta-analysis assesses the modern use of OCs and the associated cardiovascular risks.

Objective

We aimed to assess the risk of cardiovascular diseases associated with current use of low-dose combined OCs.

Data Sources

All studies published between January 1980 and October 2002 were searched using MEDLINE, BIOSIS, and Scientific Citations.

Study Selection

Original studies were selected independently by two investigators (J.P.B. P. A.E.) based on inclusion criteria: low-dose combined OC (< 50 mug of ethinyl-estradiol); more than 10 cases in low-dose users; clear definition of cases; concurrent controls; and control for age. A third investigator (J.E.N.) adjudicated disagreements. From 2715 identified articles, 14 independent studies were included.

Data Extraction

All data were abstracted by one investigator (J.P.B.) in a systematic manner. Classification of OCs and types of exposure were directly abstracted from studies. Current use was defined as use at the time of the event or within 3 months. Only peer-reviewed studies with definition of events as definite or possible, based on prespecified criteria, were included.

Data Synthesis

The summary risk estimates associated with current use of low-dose OCs were 1.84 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.38, 2.44] for myocardial infarctions and 2.12 (95% CI = 1.56, 2.86) for ischemic strokes. The overall summary odds ratio for both outcomes was 2.01 (95% CI = 1.63, 2.48). Second generation OCs were associated with a significant increased risk of both myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke events [1.85 (95% CI = 1.03,3.32) and 2.54 (95% CI = 1.96,3.28), respectively]; and third-generation OCs, for ischemic stroke outcome only [2.03 (95% CI = 1.15,3.57)].

Conclusions

In conclusion, a rigorous meta-analysis of the literature suggests that current use of low-dose OCs significantly increases the risk of both cardiac and vascular arterial events, including a significant risk of vascular arterial complications with third generation OCs.

### Progestogen-only contraceptives and the risk of acute myocardial infarction: a meta-analysis [^113vpuiH]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

Context

The association between combined oral contraceptives (OC) and the risk of myocardial infarction (MI) has been intensively studied, and conclusions are controversial. While progestogen-only contraceptives (POC) are commonly used worldwide, their impact on cardiovascular diseases is poorly investigated and remains unclear.

Objective

We carried out a meta-analysis based on EMBASE- and MEDLINE-referenced literature corresponding to OC marketed since 1960.

Methods

Eligible articles published in English language describing OC or POC use and MI outcome were reviewed, and relevant ones were extracted. All types of POC and route of administration were considered.

Results

Six case-control studies were identified. The combined odds ratio showed no increase in the MI risk with POC use (odds ratio = 1.07; 95% confidence interval, 0.62–1.84). This result was similar according to the route of administration, including implant, injectable, and oral POC.

Conclusion

Data from observational studies suggest no increase in risk of MI with POC use. However, these results are based on limited data. Further investigations are needed, especially among women at high MI risk.

### Combined oral contraceptive use among women with hypertension: a systematic review [^116xxbP6]. Contraception (2006). Low credibility.

Women with hypertension are at increased risk for cardiovascular events. Combined oral contraceptive (COC) use, even among low-dose users, has been associated with a small excess risk for cardiovascular events among healthy women. In this systematic review, we examined cardiovascular risks among COC users with hypertension. After searching MEDLINE for all articles published from 1966 through February 2005 relevant to COC use, hypertension and cardiovascular disease, we identified 25 articles for this review. Overall, these studies showed that hypertensive COC users were at higher risk for stroke and acute myocardial infarction (AMI) than hypertensive non-COC users, but that they were not at higher risk for venous thromboembolism (VTE). Women who did not have their blood pressure measured before initiating COC use were at higher risk for ischemic stroke and AMI, but not for hemorrhagic stroke or VTE, than COC users who did not have their blood pressure measured.

### Association between the reproductive health of young women and cardiovascular disease in later life: umbrella review [^113ZJw2f]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Use of oral contraceptives

Current users of any oral contraceptive (combined oral contraceptives containing a combination of oestrogen and progesterone, or progesterone only pill) had an increased risk of stroke compared with non-current users. The increase in risk was greater for ischaemic strokethan haemorrhagic stroke. The risk of both ischaemic and haemorrhagic stroke was greatest in women on higher doses of oestrogen, who had hypertension, were smokers, or were aged over 35 (supplementary table 3).

Current users of combined oral contraceptives had a greater risk of developing myocardial infarction and stroke than non-current users of combined oral contraceptives. The same reviewshowed that the risk was increased in women on higher doses of oestrogen but was not related to the dose, generation, or type of progesterone (supplementary table 3). In contrast, no association was seen between current use of the progesterone only pill and risk of myocardial infarction or stroke.

Use of non-oral contraceptive agents

Comparing users of non-oral combined hormonal contraceptive agents with users of combined oral contraceptives, no association with the development of myocardial infarction (the results were not meta-analysed, but odds ratios from individual primary studies ranged from 0.2 to 1.6) or stroke (odds ratio 0.8 to 1.2) was seen but the review was rated as low quality (table 1 and supplementary table 4).

Implications for future research

Several reproductive factors have been linked to an increased risk of ischaemic heart disease, stroke, and overall cardiovascular disease. These reproductive factors might be linked to the risk of peripheral arterial disease and heart failure, and therefore longitudinal studies are needed in this area.

Evidence from the review has suggested that women with adverse pregnancy outcomes are at risk of future cardiovascular disease outcomes. Current guidelines on prescription of contraceptives recommend a careful assessment of the eligibility for combined oral contraceptives in women with migraine, diabetes, and other existing conditions associated with a high risk of cardiovascular disease. These guidelines do not include recommendations on the safety profile of the use of combined oral contraceptives in women with adverse pregnancy outcomes and other complications related to fertility. Also, the interaction between adverse pregnancy outcomes, factors related to fertility, and other conditions predominant in women (migraine, autoimmune diseases) that predispose to cardiovascular disease needs to be investigated.

That pregnancy complications act as a stress test that unmasks women who are at an increased risk of cardiovascular disease has been postulated. Whether adverse pregnancy outcomes and reproductive factors related to fertility directly cause or act as stressors that reveal those who are already susceptible to cardiovascular disease needs to be determined. This information will help in starting preventive strategies early. Moreover, the mechanistic pathways between these reproductive factors and risk of cardiovascular disease need to be determined.

Prediction models for traditional risk factors for cardiovascular disease could underestimate the true risk of cardiovascular disease in young women because they do not account for risk factors specific to women. A recent systematic review on risk prediction models for cardiovascular disease in women noted that only 1.1% of the 260 articles included in the review investigated the added value of incorporating risk factors specific to women in risk prediction models. Even in studies that evaluated the use of predictors specific to women, however, none included predictors such as hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, gestational diabetes, polycystic ovary syndrome, and premature ovarian insufficiency. The benefit of adding reproductive factors to risk prediction models for cardiovascular disease needs to be extensively evaluated.

### Polycystic ovary syndrome: a review of diagnosis and management, with special focus on atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease prevention [^114SDtFX]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2024). Medium credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrinopathy worldwide with a heterogeneous clinical presentation including reproductive, metabolic, and endocrine elements. However, the assessment and management of PCOS remains inconsistent, with many women undiagnosed and untreated. We now also understand that the management of PCOS should extend throughout a woman's lifespan as many elements of the syndrome persist after menopause. Management has traditionally focused on the treatment of hyperandrogenism and oligomenorrhea. Women with PCOS often have dyslipidemia, hypertension, obesity, and metabolic syndrome, which may be worsened by the hormonal abnormalities, and are therefore at higher risk for cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality, a risk that increases after menopause. While treatment with hormonal therapy, in particular combined oral contraceptives, may improve cardiovascular risk factors, management plans should incorporate specific diagnosis and management of these factors, if present, because of the strong contribution to the risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Given the complexities of the syndrome, optimal management often requires a multi-disciplinary approach including the lipid and cardiometabolic specialist to provide counseling and support for lifestyle modification along with pharmacologic therapy as indicated to address the full range of any reproductive, endocrine, and cardiometabolic abnormalities.

### Recommendations from the 2023 international evidence-based guideline for the assessment and management of polycystic ovary syndrome [^111myZ3G]. European Journal of Endocrinology (2023). High credibility.

Combined oral contraceptive pills (COCPs) — adults and adolescents with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) or at risk: When prescribing COCPs in adults and adolescents with PCOS, and adolescents at risk of PCOS, it is important to address main presenting symptoms and consider other treatments such as cosmetic therapies; shared decision-making (including accurate information and reassurance on the efficacy and safety of COCP) is recommended and likely to improve adherence; natural estrogen preparations and the lowest effective estrogen doses need consideration, balancing efficacy, metabolic risk profile, side effects, cost, and availability; the relatively limited evidence on COCPs specifically in PCOS needs to be appreciated with practice informed by general population guidelines; the relative and absolute contraindications and side effects of COCPs need to be considered and be the subject of individualized discussion; and PCOS specific features, such as higher weight and cardiovascular risk factors, need to be considered.

### The state of hormonal contraception today: established and emerging noncontraceptive health benefits [^116CSgZt]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2011). Low credibility.

In the 50 years since the advent of combined oral contraceptives the amount of estrogen in oral contraceptives dropped from over 100 mcg to less than 30 mcg. Many noncontraceptive health benefits have emerged that decrease mortality and improve quality of life. Some of the immediate benefits include improvement of menorrhagia and dysmenorrhea, reduction in premenstrual dysphoric disorder symptoms, and decreased acne. As an effective birth control method oral contraceptives also decrease pregnancy-related deaths by preventing pregnancy. After the reproductive years, previous use of oral contraceptives continues to be beneficial, reducing the risk of death from ovarian and endometrial cancer. All these benefits have held up over time whereas cardiovascular risks have lessened because of the decrease in oral contraceptive pill dosage. Decreased ovarian cyst formation is an example of benefit with higher-dose oral contraceptive formulations that no longer holds true with low-dose pills.

Relation to evidence based guidelines and other reviews

Factors related to fertility

Evidence presented in this review on combined hormonal contraceptive agents and combined oral contraceptives are in keeping with findings on the adverse effects of the use of hormonal contraceptive agents reported in current evidence based guidelines. Also, the findings of this review agree with the consensus statement from the European Headache Federation, which reported that the risk of stroke was greater in women with migraine. But caution should be exercised in the interpretation of findings on the use of combined oral contraceptives and the arteriothrombotic risk. Firstly, the between study heterogeneity was high. Secondly, publication bias was not always assessed so its presence cannot be ruled out. Finally, results on current use of combined oral contraceptives in women with dyslipidaemia and current use of combined oral contraceptives in women with obesity were imprecise because they included a small number of studies. Although the absolute risk of cardiovascular disease associated with the use of combined oral contraceptives is low (about 10 per 100 000 person years for myocardial infarction and 21 per 100 000 person years for stroke), a large proportion of women (up to 18% in Europe and North America in 2019) in the reproductive age group use contraceptive pills; hence clinicians should discuss this risk with patients and ensure that women are aware of the association between the use of combined oral contraceptives and the increased risk of cardiovascular disease.

The evidence reported supports the results from an overview of reviews that investigated the association between polycystic ovary syndrome and system wide complications, including cardiovascular disease. The overview summarised evidence from two systematic reviews. Our review synthesised evidence from another three reviews, including one evaluating the risk of heart failure, but no evidence of an increased risk of heart failure in women with polycystic ovary syndrome was found. Results on the risk of heart failure were based on one cross sectional study that reported imprecise results. Moreover, cross sectional studies cannot be used to infer causality.

Guidelines on the prevention of cardiovascular disease recognise perimenopause and menopause as periods when women are vulnerable to cardiovascular disease. In line with findings in the evidence based guideline on the management of women with premature ovarian insufficiency, the evidence we evaluated reported an increased risk of ischaemic heart disease and cardiovascular disease associated with premature menopause. Also, early menopause and menopausal symptoms were associated with an increased risk of ischaemic heart disease.

### Progestogen-only pills and high blood pressure: is there an association? A literature review [^112hSmVa]. Contraception (2004). Low credibility.

The progestogen-only pill (POP) is a contraceptive option for women who have high blood pressure either induced by use of combined oral pills or due to other causes; as long as it is well controlled and monitored. Combined oral contraception (COC) and Depo-Provera have been implicated in increased cardiovascular risk following use. High blood pressure has been theorized to be the critical path that leads to this increased risk. POP is the recommended method for women who are at risk of coronary heart disease due to presence of risk factors like hypertension. In order to offer POP as a safe, alternative contraception to women who develop hypertension on COCs or those who are at increased cardiovascular risk, it is important to take into account evidence of no association of high blood pressure with POP use. A search of published medical literature (PUBMED and Cochrane database) was undertaken with this objective. A total of four articles were selected for final review after application of inclusion and exclusion criteria. Three of these were prospective control trials and one a cross-sectional survey. There was no randomized study to answer this question. The results of these studies consistently reported no significant association of high blood pressure with use of POPs for up to 2–3 years of follow-up.

### U.S. selected practice recommendations for contraceptive use, 2024 [^112gZ4gP]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2024). High credibility.

Combined hormonal contraceptives (CHCs) — blood pressure screening and hypertension restrictions — Patients who have severe hypertension (systolic pressure of ≥ 160 mm Hg or diastolic pressure of ≥ 100 mm Hg) or vascular disease should not use CHCs (U.S. MEC 4), and those with less severe hypertension (systolic pressure of 140–159 mm Hg or diastolic pressure of 90–99 mm Hg) or adequately controlled hypertension generally should not use CHCs (U.S. MEC 3); therefore, blood pressure should be evaluated before initiating CHCs, and if a provider cannot measure it, blood pressure measured in other settings can be reported by the patient to their provider. Evidence suggests that cardiovascular outcomes are worse among women who do not have their blood pressure measured before initiating combined oral contraceptives (COCs), with case-control data showing higher risk for acute myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke when blood pressure was not measured, while one study reported no difference for hemorrhagic stroke (Level of evidence: II-2, fair, direct).

### Hypertension across a woman' s Life Cycle [^112qqXMQ]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

Hypertension accounts for 1 in 5 deaths among American women, posing a greater burden for women than men, and is among their most important risk factors for death and development of cardiovascular and other diseases. Hypertension affects women in all phases of life, with specific characteristics relating to risk factors and management for primary prevention of hypertension in teenage and young adult women; hypertension in pregnancy; hypertension during use of oral contraceptives and assisted reproductive technologies, lactation, menopause, or hormone replacement; hypertension in elderly women; and issues of race and ethnicity. All are detailed in this review, as is information relative to women in clinical trials of hypertension and medication issues. The overarching message is that effective treatment and control of hypertension improves cardiovascular outcomes. But many knowledge gaps persist, including the contribution of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy to cardiovascular disease risk, the role of hormone replacement, blood pressure targets for elderly women, and so on.

Methodological quality

Thirty two reviews were rated as moderate in quality and seven reviews were rated as low in quality (appendix 7). All seven low quality reviews did not meet three of the seven domains considered critical: they had not stated that the review methods were established before conducting the review; they had not used a comprehensive search strategy; and they had not provided a list of excluded studies and the justification for their exclusion.

Overlapping and non-overlapping associations

Twenty three reviews reported overlapping associations. Overlapping associations included: current use of combined oral contraceptives and risk of myocardial infarction, n = 2; use of combined oral contraceptives and risk of ischaemic stroke, n = 3; use of combined oral contraceptives and risk of haemorrhagic stroke, n = 2; use of progesterone only pill and risk of stroke, n = 2; use of combined oral contraceptives in migraine and risk of stroke, n = 2; early menarche and mortality from cardiovascular disease, n = 2; early menopause and risk of fatal cardiovascular disease, n = 3; pre-eclampsia and risk of cardiovascular disease, n = 2; gestational diabetes and risk of cardiovascular disease, n = 3; preterm birth and risk of cardiovascular disease, n = 3; and polycystic ovary syndrome and risk of cardiovascular disease, n = 3. Appendix 8 describes the general characteristics of the reviews with overlapping associations, including the decision to retain or exclude an association from the analysis.

Appendix 3 provides an example of the assessment of the degree of overlap with a citation matrix. Appendix 9 lists the thirty two reviews with non-overlapping associations that were included in the analysis and the seven contemporary reviews that were excluded because of overlap.

### Tailoring combination oral contraceptives to the individual woman [^116XcHi4]. Journal of Women's Health (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Over the last 50 years, there has been intense interest in the type of progestin used in combined oral contraceptives (COC) in an attempt to exploit novel properties and minimize adverse events. At the same time, the dose of synthetic estrogen, ethinylestradiol, in COC pills has been reduced to minimize risks for ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction, and venous thromboembolism. New formulations, including extended-cycle or continuous-use COCs or those that use a natural estrogen, estradiol, may offer improvements over their predecessors.

Methods

A Medline search was performed to encompass studies published since 1990 that pertain to the pharmacology of estrogens and progestins used in COCs, risks and adverse events associated with COCs, and extended or continuous-use COCs.

Results

New progestins structurally related to progesterone and spironolactone may exhibit more selective binding to the progesterone receptor and lack androgenic adverse effects associated with progestins structurally related to testosterone. Recently, COCs containing natural (17β-estradiol) or conjugated estrogen (estradiol valerate) rather than ethinylestradiol have been developed in order to move to a more natural estrogen. Although many of the new progestins incorporated into COCs have not demonstrated the negative effects on lipid metabolism and other adverse events associated with the traditional progestins, the goal of attaining good cycle control has yet to be achieved. Extended-cycle and continuous-use regimens are now available that reduce the frequency of menses, but breakthrough bleeding remains a problem.

Conclusions

Appropriate counseling to raise awareness of the specific characteristics of the different COC options available may optimize adherence and patient acceptability.

### Association between the reproductive health of young women and cardiovascular disease in later life: umbrella review [^116xcyz3]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To consolidate evidence from systematic reviews and meta-analyses investigating the association between reproductive factors in women of reproductive age and their subsequent risk of cardiovascular disease.

Design

Umbrella review.

Data Sources

Medline, Embase, and Cochrane databases for systematic reviews and meta-analyses from inception until 31 August 2019.

Review Methods

Two independent reviewers undertook screening, data extraction, and quality appraisal. The population was women of reproductive age. Exposures were fertility related factors and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Outcome was cardiovascular diseases in women, including ischaemic heart disease, heart failure, peripheral arterial disease, and stroke.

Results

32 reviews were included, evaluating multiple risk factors over an average follow-up period of 7–10 years. All except three reviews were of moderate quality. A narrative evidence synthesis with forest plots and tabular presentations was performed. Associations for composite cardiovascular disease were: twofold for pre-eclampsia, stillbirth, and preterm birth; 1.5–1.9-fold for gestational hypertension, placental abruption, gestational diabetes, and premature ovarian insufficiency; and less than 1.5-fold for early menarche, polycystic ovary syndrome, ever parity, and early menopause. A longer length of breastfeeding was associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease. The associations for ischaemic heart disease were twofold or greater for pre-eclampsia, recurrent pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes, and preterm birth; 1.5–1.9-fold for current use of combined oral contraceptives (oestrogen and progesterone), recurrent miscarriage, premature ovarian insufficiency, and early menopause; and less than 1.5-fold for miscarriage, polycystic ovary syndrome, and menopausal symptoms. For stroke outcomes, the associations were twofold or more for current use of any oral contraceptive (combined oral contraceptives or progesterone only pill), pre-eclampsia, and recurrent pre-eclampsia; 1.5–1.9-fold for current use of combined oral contraceptives, gestational diabetes, and preterm birth; and less than 1.5-fold for polycystic ovary syndrome. The association for heart failure was fourfold for pre-eclampsia. No association was found between cardiovascular disease outcomes and current use of progesterone only contraceptives, use of non-oral hormonal contraceptive agents, or fertility treatment.

Conclusions

From menarche to menopause, reproductive factors were associated with cardiovascular disease in women. In this review, presenting absolute numbers on the scale of the problem was not feasible; however, if these associations are causal, they could account for a large proportion of unexplained risk of cardiovascular disease in women, and the risk might be modifiable. Identifying reproductive risk factors at an early stage in the life of women might facilitate the initiation of strategies to modify potential risks. Policy makers should consider incorporating reproductive risk factors as part of the assessment of cardiovascular risk in clinical guidelines.

### Combined hormonal contraceptive use among obese women and risk for cardiovascular events: a systematic review [^116p1wmd]. Contraception (2016). Low credibility.

Context

Combined hormonal contraceptive (CHC) use may modify the risk of cardiovascular events in obese [body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30 kg/m²] women.

Objective

The objective was to evaluate from the literature whether CHC use modifies the risk of acute myocardial infarction (AMI), stroke, cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) and venous thromboembolism (VTE) in obese women and to evaluate evidence for a dose-response relationship between BMI and VTE.

Methods

We searched PubMed for all articles published between database inception and February 2016 providing direct evidence on BMI, CHCs, and cardiovascular outcomes. We also searched for indirect evidence related to a dose-response relationship between BMI and risk of VTE in the general population, as these data were lacking for CHC users. The quality of each individual study was assessed using the system for grading evidence developed by the United States Preventive Services Task Force.

Results

The direct evidence search yielded 3 pooled analyses, 11 case-control studies and 1 cohort study. There was conflicting evidence about the risk of AMI or stroke among obese combined oral contraceptive (COC) users compared to obese nonusers, with one study finding no increased risk for AMI or stroke for COC users overall or stratified by BMI. A second study found significantly increased risk of AMI and stroke for COC users, with the highest risk estimates for high-BMI COC users. A single study suggested that obese COC users may be at higher risk for CVT compared with normal-weight nonusers. For VTE, obese COC users consistently had a risk that was 5 to 8 times that of obese nonusers and approximately 10 times that of nonobese nonusers. Five prospective cohort studies were identified as indirect evidence, and all found increased risk for VTE as BMI increased, suggesting a dose-response relationship between BMI and risk for VTE. No studies on the contraceptive patch or vaginal ring were identified that met the inclusion criteria.

Conclusion

Limited evidence of Level II-2, fair quality, concerning whether CHC use modifies the risk of AMI and stroke in obese women is inconclusive, while a single study of Level II-2, poor quality, found that obese COC users may be at higher risk for CVT compared with normal-weight nonusers. Both COC use and higher BMI increase risk for VTE, and the greatest relative risks are for those with both risk factors based on a body of evidence graded as Level II-2, fair to poor quality. It is not possible to estimate absolute risk of VTE among women with both of these risk factors; however, the absolute risk of VTE in healthy women of reproductive age is small.

### Contraceptive hormone use and cardiovascular disease [^115crVkP]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

Contraceptive hormones, most commonly prescribed as oral contraceptives (OCs), are a widely utilized method to prevent ovulation, implantation, and, therefore, pregnancy. The Women's Health Initiative demonstrated cardiovascular risk linked to menopausal hormone therapy among women without pre-existing cardiovascular disease, prompting a review of the safety, efficacy, and side effects of other forms of hormone therapy. A variety of basic science, animal, and human data suggests that contraceptive hormones have antiatheromatous effects; however, relatively less is known regarding the impact on atherosclerosis, thrombosis, vasomotion, and arrhythmogenesis. Newer generation OC formulations in use indicate no increased myocardial infarction risk for current users, but a persistent increased risk of venous thromboembolism. There are no cardiovascular data available for the newest generation contraceptive hormone formulations, including those that contain newer progestins that lower blood pressure, as well as the nonoral routes (transdermal and vaginal). Current guidelines indicate that, as with all medication, contraceptive hormones should be selected and initiated by weighing risks and benefits for the individual patient. Women 35 years and older should be assessed for cardiovascular risk factors including hypertension, smoking, diabetes, nephropathy, and other vascular diseases, including migraines, prior to use. Existing data are mixed with regard to possible protection from OCs for atherosclerosis and cardiovascular events; longer-term cardiovascular follow-up of menopausal women with regard to prior OC use, including subgroup information regarding adequacy of ovulatory cycling, the presence of hyperandrogenic conditions, and the presence of prothrombotic genetic disorders is needed to address this important issue.

### Combined hormonal contraceptive use among women with known dyslipidemias: a systematic review of critical safety outcomes [^113YmPDi]. Contraception (2016). Low credibility.

Context

Dyslipidemias represent a spectrum of lipid disorders that are important risk factors for cardiovascular disease. In addition, elevated triglycerides are known to be associated with pancreatitis. Though less clear, it is possible that dyslipidemias may also contribute to risk for venous thromboembolism (VTE). Ethinyl estradiol and progestogen, contained within combined hormonal contraception, are known to impact lipid metabolism.

Objectives

To evaluate from the literature whether use of combined hormonal contraception (CHC), including combined oral contraception (COC) pills, transdermal patch, vaginal ring or injectables, modifies the relative risk of acute myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, VTE or pancreatitis among women with known dyslipidemias and to determine if existing lipid abnormalities worsen with CHC use.

Methods

PubMed and the Cochrane Library databases were searched for all articles in all languages published between inception and September 2014 relevant to dyslipidemia, CHC use and serious adverse events (MI, stroke, VTE or pancreatitis). The quality of each individual study was assessed using the system for grading evidence developed by the United States Preventive Services Task Force.

Results

From 306 articles identified by our search strategy, 3 articles met inclusion criteria. In a poor-quality case-control study, women with hypercholesterolemia but no COC use had an increased risk of MI (adjusted odds ratio [adj OR] 3.3, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.6–6.8), as did women who used COCs but did not have hypercholesterolemia (adj OR 2.0, 95% CI 1.4–2.8), compared with non-COC users without hypercholesterolemia; women with both COC use and hypercholesterolemia had an adjusted OR of 24.7 (95% CI 5.6–108.5) compared with women with neither risk factor. A poor-quality cohort study examined COC users and reported that women with dyslipidemia had increased risk for VTE [crude risk ratio (RR) 1.39, 95% CI 1.04–1.85] and transient ischemic attacks or cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs) (RR 1.76, 95% CI 1.51–2.06) compared to those without dyslipidemia. Another poor-quality cohort study provided direct evidence on changes in lipid levels among COC users with dyslipidemia. A minority of women with elevated total cholesterol or triglyceride levels at baseline showed normal results (25% and 28%, respectively) after 6 cycles of COC use. No evidence regarding risks associated with use of other CHC methods was identified. No evidence was identified for the outcome of pancreatitis.

Conclusion

Limited data from poor-quality observational studies suggest that women with known dyslipidemias using CHC may be at increased risk for MI and may experience a minimal increase in risk for CVA or VTE. No evidence was identified on risk for pancreatitis in this context. The impact of CHC exposure on the status of lipid abnormalities over time, an intermediate marker for disease, is also unclear. Given the significant limitations of this body of evidence, the importance of access to effective contraception and theoretical concerns raised about the use of CHCs by women with known dyslipidemias, additional rigorous studies are needed to best estimate true associations. Contraceptive decision making should include consideration of both the known and theoretical risks of a given CHC method, safety and acceptability of alternative contraceptive methods, and risks associated with unintended pregnancy.

### Association between the reproductive health of young women and cardiovascular disease in later life: umbrella review [^113LmZgG]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

This detailed umbrella review synthesised existing systematic reviews and meta-analyses into one user friendly document. The review has updated a previous systematic review on the association between breastfeeding and maternal cardiovascular outcomes, and identified gaps and proposed recommendations for research and practice, particularly with respect to relevant UK guidelines (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, and Faculty of Sexual and Reproductive Healthcare).

Main findings

Evidence from the umbrella review suggests that current use of combined oral contraceptives, use of combined hormonal contraceptive agents in women with dyslipidaemia, use of combined hormonal contraceptive agents in women with hypertension, use of oestrogen containing pills in women with migraine, polycystic ovary syndrome, premature ovarian insufficiency, early menarche, early menopause, menopausal symptoms, parity, pre-eclampsia, recurrent pre-eclampsia, preterm births, gestational diabetes, gestational hypertension, miscarriages, stillbirths, placental abruption, and small for gestational age are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease outcomes. The review on length of lactation and the recently published studies suggest that breastfeeding for longer reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease. Length of lactation might be a proxy for general health state but never breastfed was associated with vascular characteristics (larger arterial lumen and adventitial diameters) linked to a higher risk of cardiovascular disease independent of sociodemographic characteristics, health related behaviour, family history, and body mass index. The evidence was inconclusive on the association between use of combined hormonal contraceptive agents in women with a high body mass index (> 27.3) and the risk of cardiovascular disease outcomes. No association was found between current use of progesterone only contraceptives, use of non-oral combined hormonal contraceptive agents, or fertility treatment and the risk of cardiovascular disease outcomes. Reviews on endometriosis, pelvic inflammatory disease, and anaemia during pregnancy were absent.

Contraception in women at high cardiovascular disease risk

Combined oral contraceptive pills (OCP) carry an increased risk for venous thrombosis, MI, and stroke, which is significantly enhanced by cigarette smoking. OCPs containing high-dose ethinyl oestradiol have been associated with increased BP. This is due to increased production of angiotensinogen/angiotensin II and related to OCP formulation/dose. In the Danish Cohort Study, use of combined OCPs containing 20 μg of ethinyl oestradiol increased the relative risk of both thrombotic stroke and MI by 1.60 (95% CI 1.37–1.86) and 1.40 (95% CI 1.07–1.81), respectively, in comparison to non-OCP users. Thus, OCP's containing ethinyl oestradiol should be avoided in women with a history of VTE, stroke, CVD, or any other PVD. The ACOG has developed guidelines for use of OCP in women at elevated cardiovascular risk. In healthy women below 35 years with pre-existing hypertension, OCP can be used. If BP remains stable after a few months, OCP may be continued. Use of OCP is contraindicated in women older than 35 years who smoke, have severe dyslipidaemia, or obesity. Progestin-only contraceptives (POCs) are not associated with increased vascular risk (arterial or venous), although evidence suggests that MPA use may be associated with a slightly increased risk. In women at CVD risk, POC administered by oral, sub-cutaneous, or intra-uterine routes can be prescribed.

### Contraception update: extended use of long acting methods, hormonal contraception risks, and over the counter access [^112QKTGy]. Journal of Women's Health (2018). Low credibility.

The clinical update serves as a brief review of recently published, high-impact, and potentially practice changing journal articles summarized for our readers. Topics include menopause, sexual dysfunction, breast health, contraception, osteoporosis, and cardiovascular disease. For this clinical update, we reviewed both reproductive and general medical journals for clinically relevant publications related to the use of contraceptive methods. We have chosen to highlight articles examining the extended use of highly effective (long-acting) methods, complications of implants, risks associated with oral combined hormonal contraceptives, and the availability of over the counter contraception.

### Cardiovascular profile of pharmacological agents used for the management of polycystic ovary syndrome [^114JMFma]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Hormonal contraception

Combined oral contraceptives (OCPs) are often used as first-line therapy in women with PCOS to address menstrual regularity, acne and hirsutism. It has been well recognized that the long-term use of estrogen-containing OCPs may have an adverse cardiovascular risk, but whether this translates into additional cardiovascular risk in these patients is unclear.

Oral contraceptives are associated with hypertension, dyslipidemia and an elevated C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), a marker of inflammation. In addition, there is an increased risk of developing metabolic syndrome. The decreased insulin sensitivity associated with their use depends on the progestin used, with fourth generation progestins being less impactful, and those containing cyproterone being associated with increased insulin secretion. All of these features are associated with obese patients with PCOS and with the increased risk of developing prediabetes and T2D;, however, a Cochrane meta-analysis suggested that OCPs did not affect glucose tolerance, though the evidence reviewed was not comprehensive. The effect of OCPs on lipid parameters depends on the progestin component, with estrogen increasing high density lipoprotein (HDL) and triglycerides while decreasing low density lipoprotein (LDL) and total cholesterol. Those progestins with an androgenic profile are associated with a lower HDL and increased LDL cholesterol, the converse occurring with less androgenic preparations.

### Contraception for women in selected circumstances [^114h3jcx]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To review new evidence regarding ten controversial issues in the use of contraceptive methods among women with special conditions and to present World Health Organization recommendations derived in part from this evidence.

Data Sources

We searched MEDLINE and PREMEDLINE databases for English-language articles, published between January 1995 and December 2001, for evidence relevant to ten key contraceptive method and condition combinations: combined oral contraceptive (OC) use among women with hypertension or headaches, combined OC use for emergency contraception and adverse events, progestogen-only contraception use among young women and among breast-feeding women, tubal sterilization among young women, hormonal contraception and intrauterine device use among women who are human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive, have AIDS, or are at high risk of HIV infection. Search terms included: "contraception", "contraceptives, oral", "progestational hormones", "medroxyprogesterone-17 acetate", "norethindrone", "levonorgestrel", "Norplant", "contraceptives, postcoital", "sterilization, tubal", "intrauterine devices", "hypertension", "stroke", "myocardial infarction", "thrombosis", "headache", "migraine", "adverse effects", "bone mineral density", "breast-feeding", "lactation", "age factors", "regret", and "HIV".

Study Selection

From 205 articles, we identified 33 studies published in peer-reviewed journals that specifically examined risks of contraceptive use among women with pre-existing conditions.

Tabulation, Integration, and Results

Combined OC users with hypertension appear to be at increased risk of myocardial infarction and stroke relative to users without hypertension. Combined OC users with migraine appear to be at increased risk of stroke relative to nonusers with migraine. The evidence for the other eight method and condition combinations was either insufficient to draw conclusions or identified no excess risk.

Conclusion

Of ten contraceptive method and condition combinations assessed, the evidence supported an increased risk of cardiovascular complications with combined OC use by women with hypertension or migraine. As new evidence becomes available, assessment of risk and recommendations for use of contraceptive methods can be revised accordingly.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 2 [^114s2gVe]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

Combined oral contraceptives (COC) and other contraceptive modalities — lipid and thrombotic effects are outlined: COC use carries thrombotic risk and most products contain ≤ 35 μg of ethinyl-estradiol; the estrogen component frequently increases triglycerides (TG) and HDL-C and lowers LDL-C, while androgenic progestins (norgestrel, levonorgestrel) can raise LDL-C and lower HDL-C; low-dose norethindrone COCs and desogestrel raise HDL-C and lower LDL-C, and higher estrogen content can cause severe hypertriglyceridemia in women with high baseline TG. Transdermal or vaginal contraceptives do not have a lower thrombotic risk than COC, but transdermal formulations are less prone to clinically important TG elevations. Progestin-only oral, injectable, and implantable options are available and efficacious, though they are not as effective for contraception and have greater risk of breakthrough bleeding.

### Progestogen-only contraceptives and the risk of stroke: a meta-analysis [^112B8NG6]. Stroke (2009). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

The association between combined oral contraceptives (OC) use and increased risk of stroke has been reported. While progestogen-only contraceptives (POC) are commonly used worldwide, their impact on cardiovascular disease remains unclear.

Methods

A meta-analysis based on EMBASE and MEDLINE referenced literature corresponding to OCs marketed since 1960 was carried out. Eligible articles assessing the risk of stroke in relation to OC or POC were reviewed, and relevant studies were extracted. All types of POC and routes of administration were taken into account in the meta-analysis.

Results

Six case-control studies were identified. The combined odd ratio (OR) showed no increase in the risk of stroke among POC users (OR = 0.96; 95% confidence interval: 0.70 to 1.31). This result was similar according to the route of administration (either implant or injectable or oral POC).

Conclusions

Data from observational studies show that POC use is not associated with an increased risk of stroke. However, these results are based on limited data. Further investigations are needed in women with risk factors of stroke.

a. Myocardial infarction

An increased risk of myocardial infarction has been attributed to combined oral contraceptive use. This risk is primarily in smokers or women with other underlying risk factors for coronary artery disease such as hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, morbid obesity, and diabetes. The relative risk of heart attack for current combined oral contraceptive users has been estimated to be two to six. The risk is very low under the age of 30.

Smoking in combination with combined oral contraceptive use has been shown to contribute substantially to the incidence of myocardial infarctions in women in their mid-thirties or older with smoking accounting for the majority of excess cases. Mortality rates associated with circulatory disease have been shown to increase substantially in smokers over the age of 35 and non-smokers over the age of 40

(Figure 3) among women who use combined oral contraceptives.

Figure 3. Circulatory Disease Mortality Rates per 100,000 Woman Years by Age, Smoking Status and Combined Oral Contraceptive Use

Combined oral contraceptives may compound the effects of well-known risk factors, such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemias, age and obesity. In particular, some progestogens are known to decrease HDL cholesterol and cause glucose intolerance, while estrogens may create a state of hyperinsulinism. Combined oral contraceptives have been shown to increase blood pressure among users (see Section 10 in WARNINGS). Similar effects on risk factors have been associated with an increased risk of heart disease. Combined oral contraceptives must be used with caution in women with cardiovascular disease risk factors.

### Levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol (vienva) [^115bbbqY]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

The risk of blood clots is greater in users of combination oral contraceptives compared to nonusers. The risk of abnormal blood clotting increases with age in both users and nonusers of combination oral contraceptives, but the increased risk from the oral contraceptive appears to be present at all ages.

The excess risk of blood clots is highest during the first year a woman ever uses a combined oral contraceptive. This increased risk is lower than blood clots associated with pregnancy. The use of combination oral contraceptives also increases the risk of other clotting disorders, including heart attack and stroke. Blood clots in veins cause death in 1% to 2% of cases. The risk of clotting is further increased in women with other conditions. Examples include: smoking, high blood pressure, abnormal lipid levels, certain inherited or acquired clotting disorders, obesity, surgery or injury with prolonged inactivity or bedrest, recent delivery or second trimester abortion. Discuss with your healthcare provider whether combination oral contraceptives should be stopped before surgery with prolonged inactivity or bedrest.

Cigarette smoking increases the risk of serious cardiovascular events from COC use. This risk increases with age and amount of smoking and is quite pronounced in women over 35. Women who use combination oral contraceptives should be strongly advised not to smoke. If you smoke you should not use combination oral contraceptives.

### Cardiovascular risk profile according to World Health Organization medical eligibility criteria for contraceptive use of women using hormonal contraception in rio de janeiro state, Brazil [^1173G1us]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Hormonal contraception, especially combined oral contraceptives, is associated with an increase in cardiovascular risk. Thus, we aimed to analyze the use of hormonal contraceptive methods in the state of Rio de Janeiro (Brazil), with a focus on determining whether contraceptive use follows the cardiovascular profile of women according to the World Health Organization Medical Eligibility Criteria for Contraceptive Use (MEC).

Methods

This was a descriptive cross-sectional study based on a self-completed online survey about information concerning socioeconomic status, cardiovascular profile, and hormonal contraceptive use. A total of 501 responses were evaluated.

Results

Combined oral contraceptive was the choice of 58.97% of participants. Our data show that 88.27% of participants presented at least one cardiovascular risk factor, with sedentary lifestyle, overweight, and obesity being the most prevalent. Regarding cardiovascular risk factors considered in MEC, 81.60% of participants use the appropriate contraceptive for their health. Most women reported using the contraceptive with a prescription, including 83.33% of participants in categories 3 and 4, which represent contraindications for hormonal contraceptive use according to MEC.

Conclusion

Although most women living in Rio de Janeiro use an appropriate hormonal contraceptive, clinical management and cardiovascular risk assessment must be improved to protect women's health and ensure an evidence-based family planning strategy.

Sex Specific

An increasing body of evidence suggests CVD risk assessment in women should extend beyond the traditional CVD risk factor assessment to include a reproductive evaluation that considers age at menarche, menstruation, contraception use, pregnancy, ovarian health, menopause, and hormonal therapy use.

Early age at menarche has been shown to increase the risk of CVD among white women. 47 Women with irregular menstrual cycles, including polycystic ovary syndrome, have an increased risk of metabolic abnormalities and CVD risk factors, such as diabetes mellitus. Combined oral contraceptive therapy increases the risk of arterial thrombosis and predisposes women to MI and/or stroke, particularly those aged > 35 years who have numerous cardiovascular risk factors, especially smoking. 48

Pregnancy creates a natural stress on the cardiovascular system, with structural and hemodynamic changes to accommodate increased blood volume and cardiac output. These normal physiologic changes often unmask or exacerbate prepregnancy cardiac and brain conditions (eg, congenital heart disease and VHD) or lead to the development of new cardiac conditions (eg, arrhythmia, pregnancy‐associated MI, peripartum cardiomyopathy, aortic dissection, and aneurysm). As a result, CVD is a leading cause of maternal morbidity and mortality during pregnancy and postpartum. Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, gestational diabetes mellitus, preterm birth, and infertility are independent sex‐specific CVD risk factors associated with subsequent premature atherosclerotic CVD, arrhythmia, and HF. 49

Premature menopause occurs before the age of 40 years and may be spontaneous as a result of primary or secondary ovarian insufficiency or surgical after bilateral oophorectomy. In general, women are at lower risk of CVD than age‐matched men during their reproductive years, but this advantage disappears after menopause. 50 There are conflicting data as to whether the type of menopause (spontaneous versus surgical) affects CVD risk. Early (at age 40–45 years) and especially premature menopause are associated with increased CVD morbidity and mortality. 50 The adverse effects of menopause on cardiovascular health are largely attributed to hypoestrogenemia. 50 This includes an atherogenic cardiometabolic profile with impaired glucose tolerance, an increase in total and low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol and lipoprotein(a), a decrease in high‐density lipoprotein cholesterol, an elevated blood pressure, an increase in central obesity, and a withdrawal of the beneficial effects of estrogen on vasodilation.

Use of hormonal contraceptive agents in women with coexisting medical illnesses

Use of hormonal contraceptive agents was associated with an additional risk of cardiovascular disease in women who had coexisting medical conditions. The risk of stroke in women diagnosed with migraine was 2–16-fold greater for those taking combined hormonal contraceptive agents than those not taking combined hormonal contraceptives (table 1). Similarly, in women with dyslipidaemia, results derived from one primary study reported in the systematic review showed that users of combined hormonal contraceptive agents were at an increased risk of myocardial infarctionand cerebrovascular accident compared with non-users (table 1). Use of combined oral contraceptives in women with hypertension women was associated with a much higher risk of myocardial infarction (odds ratio 6 to 68) and ischaemic stroke (odds ratio 3.1 to 14.5) than women with normal blood pressure taking non-combined oral contraceptives. But use of combined hormonal contraceptives in women with a high body mass index (> 27.3 kg/m²) was not found to be a multiplicative or additive risk factor for the development of myocardial infarction or stroke (table 1). Reviews assessing the association between the use of combined oral contraceptives in women with a high body mass index and the risk of myocardial infarction or stroke were rated as low quality (appendix 7).

Polycystic ovary syndrome

Women with polycystic ovary syndrome had a 1.3-fold greater risk of developing composite cardiovascular disease than women who did not have polycystic ovary syndrome (table 1). This increased risk was maintained when examining ischaemic heart diseaseand strokeseparately (supplementary table 3). Results from population based studies suggested that, compared with healthy controls, the risk of cardiovascular events was increased in young women in the reproductive age group with polycystic ovary syndrome (hazard ratio 1.43, 95% confidence interval 1.27 to 1.61); no association was seen in postmenopausal women with polycystic ovary syndrome (supplementary table 3)but this review was rated as low quality. Based on the results of one cross sectional study, no association was found between polycystic ovary syndrome and the risk of heart failure (table 1 and supplementary table 4).

Fertility treatment

Women receiving fertility treatment (ovulation induction, in vitro fertilisation, and intrauterine insemination with drug treatment) had no greater risk of developing composite cardiovascular disease or stroke than infertile women not on fertility treatment.

### Are we overestimating the stroke risk related to contraceptive pills? [^116gqHQp]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Hormonal contraceptives are used by million of women worldwide. Ischemic stroke is one of the major harmful effects of hormonal contraceptives, but remains a very uncommon disease before menopause. The increased risk of stroke under third and fourth-generation contraceptive pills and nonoral contraceptives has been recently highlighted. Given the benefits associated with combined hormonal contraceptives (COCs), it is important to properly evaluate their risks in order to provide a better benefit/risk balance to young women.

Recent Findings

Scarce studies addressing the rates of stroke in young women suggest that the fraction attributable to the contraceptive pill remains low. In contrast, there is abundant literature on the relative risks of stroke under COCs. The risk of arterial disease seems to be similar among users of second and third-generation pills, drospirenone-containing pills and nonoral hormonal contraceptives. Progestin-only contraceptives do not appear to be associated with an increased risk of stroke.

Summary

New formulations of hormonal contraceptives are not safer than second-generation COCs. Even if the absolute numbers of strokes attributable to hormonal contraceptives is very low, stringent selection of patients should help to reduce the events still more, and progestin-only contraceptives/nonhormonal methods should be preferred in cases of associated risk factors.

Combined hormonal contraceptives (CHCs) — age and parity classifications indicate menarche to < 40 years is category 1 and age ≥ 40 years is category 2, while parity is classified as nulliparous 1 and parous 1. Evidence notes that CHCs might decrease bone mineral density (BMD) in adolescents, especially with very low-dose combined oral contraceptives (COCs) containing < 30 μg ethinyl estradiol, with little to no effect on BMD in premenopausal women. Comment states that the risk for cardiovascular disease increases with age and might increase with CHC use, and that in the absence of other adverse clinical conditions, CHCs can be used until menopause.

### Hypertension in women [^113vgiKM]. Hypertension Research (2012). Low credibility.

Hypertension is an important modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular (CV) morbidity and mortality, and a highly prevalent condition in both men and women. However, the prevalence of hypertension is predicted to increase more among women than men. Combined oral contraceptives (COCs) can induce hypertension in a small group of women and, increase CV risk especially among those with hypertension. Both COC-related increased CV risk and blood pressure (BP) returns to pretreatment levels by 3 months of its discontinuation. The effects of menopause and hormone replacement therapy (HRT) on BP are controversial, and COCs and HRT containing the new generation progestin drospirenone are preferred in women with established hypertension. Despite the high incidence of cancer in women, CV disease remains the major cause of death in women and comparable benefit of antihypertensive treatment have been demonstrated in both women and men.

a. Myocardial infarction

An increased risk of myocardial infarction has been attributed to combined oral contraceptive use. This risk is primarily in smokers or women with other underlying risk factors for coronary artery disease such as hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, morbid obesity, and diabetes. The relative risk of heart attack for current combined oral contraceptive users has been estimated to be two to six. The risk is very low under the age of 30.

Smoking in combination with combined oral contraceptive use has been shown to contribute substantially to the incidence of myocardial infarctions in women in their mid-thirties or older with smoking accounting for the majority of excess cases. Mortality rates associated with circulatory disease have been shown to increase substantially in smokers over the age of 35 and non-smokers over the age of 40 (Figure 3) among women who use combined oral contraceptives.

Figure 3. Circulatory Disease Mortality Rates per 100,000 Woman Years by Age, Smoking Status and Combined Oral Contraceptive Use

Adapted from P.M. Layde and V. Beral

Combined oral contraceptives may compound the effects of well-known risk factors, such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemias, age and obesity. In particular, some progestogens are known to decrease HDL cholesterol and cause glucose intolerance, while estrogens may create a state of hyperinsulinism. Combined oral contraceptives have been shown to increase blood pressure among users (see Section 10 in WARNINGS). Similar effects on risk factors have been associated with an increased risk of heart disease. Combined oral contraceptives must be used with caution in women with cardiovascular disease risk factors.

### Levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol (lutera) [^115uQ2JW]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

The excess risk of blood clots is highest during the first year a woman ever uses a combined oral contraceptive. This increased risk is lower than blood clots associated with pregnancy. The use of combination oral contraceptives also increases the risk of other clotting disorders, including heart attack and stroke. Blood clots in veins cause death in 1% to 2% of cases. The risk of clotting is further increased in women with other conditions. Examples include: smoking, high blood pressure, abnormal lipid levels, certain inherited or acquired clotting disorders, obesity, surgery or injury, recent delivery or second trimester abortion, prolonged inactivity or bed rest. If possible, combination oral contraceptives should be stopped before surgery and during prolonged inactivity or bedrest.

Cigarette smoking increases the risk of serious cardiovascular events. This risk increases with age and amount of smoking and is quite pronounced in women over 35. Women who use combination oral contraceptives should be strongly advised not to smoke. If you smoke you should talk to your health care professional before taking combination oral contraceptives.

### Cardiovascular risks associated with the use of drospirenone-containing combined oral contraceptives [^115DFVhC]. Contraception (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

The "Long-term Active Surveillance Study for Oral Contraceptives" investigated the risks of long-term use of a 21-day regimen of drospirenone and ethinylestradiol (DRSP) compared to established oral contraceptives (OCs) in a routine clinical setting.

Study Design

Prospective, controlled, non-interventional cohort study conducted in seven European countries with three main exposure groups: new users of DRSP, levonorgestrel-containing OCs (LNG), and OCs containing other progestogens (Other OCs). All self-reported clinical outcomes of interest (OoI) were validated via attending physicians and relevant source documents. Main OoI were serious clinical outcomes, in particular cardiovascular events. Comprehensive follow-up procedures were implemented. Statistical analyses were based on Cox regression models.

Results

A total of 1,113 study centers enrolled 59,510 women. Overall 28%, 26% and 45% of these women used DRSP, LNG and Other OCs, respectively. Study participants were followed for up to ten years (mean value, 5.4years), which generated 318,784 woman-years (WY) of observation. Low loss to follow-up and drop-out rates of 2.9% and 16.8% were achieved. DRSP, LNG, and Other OCs showed similar incidence rates of venous thromboembolism. Corresponding hazard ratios (HRs) were close to unity. For arterial thromboembolic events (ATE) and initiation of antihypertensive treatment statistically significant lower risks were found for DRSP compared to LNG and Other OCs.

Conclusion

DRSP use was associated with similar general health risks and a low risk of ATE compared to OCs containing other progestogens.

Implication Statement

The 21-day regimen of drospirenone-containing combined oral contraceptives is associated with similar risk of VTE compared to other combined oral contraceptives as well as potentially with a lower risk of ATE.

Premature ovarian insufficiency

Women with premature ovarian insufficiency (POI), defined as the loss of ovarian function before the age of 40, have a shorter life expectancy than women with a late menopause due to CVD and osteoporosis. A meta-analysis showed an increased risk of CVD for women with POI, early menopause (age 40–44 years), and relatively early menopause (age 45–49 years). Each year of early menopause was associated with a 3% increased risk of CVD.

Data regarding risk of stroke in early menopause and POI are conflicting. A recent meta-analysis demonstrated an increased risk of stroke in both POI and early menopause, but not in women with relatively early menopause. Adverse effects of POI and early menopause have been shown on lipid profile, body composition, systolic BP, insulin sensitivity, risk of metabolic syndrome, endothelial function, and inflammatory markers. Women with an early menopause have a 12% higher risk of developing diabetes compared to women who experienced menopause at a later age.

Although in non-human primate studies premature atherosclerosis was found in animal models of POI, this was not replicated in human studies on subclinical atherosclerosis as assessed by CIMT and CAC. The lack of endogenous hormones after menopause and an underlying genetic predisposition to abnormal DNA repair may result in an accelerated general ageing phenotype, contributing to both early age at menopause and increased risk of CVD. Genetically impaired DNA repair also contributes to higher risk for cancer and cardiac damage of cancer therapy and to a higher risk for peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM).

Management of premature ovarian insufficiency

Prospective randomized data are lacking on the effect of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) as it is termed in women with POI, although most available evidence suggests a beneficial effect on CVD. In women with POI, HRT is recommended until at least the average age of menopause. This is supported by a recent meta-analysis which showed that the largest reduction in CVD incidence was in women with POI or early menopause who used HRT for at least 10 years. Early initiation of HRT had the greatest reduction in CVD, highlighting the importance of timely diagnosis and treatment. Although combined oral contraceptive and HRT are both treatment options in women with POI, the use of HRT has a superior effect metabolically and on bone density. The risks and benefits of HRT in women with POI and early menopause are different from those using MHT in peri- and post-menopause, and accurate individual counselling is therefore vital.

### Risk-benefit assessment of ethinylestradiol using a physiologically based pharmacokinetic modeling approach [^113dSn8E]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2018). Low credibility.

Study Highlights

Despite continuous advocacy for contraceptive use among women as an effective means of birth control, a recent study carried out by the British Pregnancy Advisory Service (BPAS) criticized the apparent inefficacy of contraceptives. More than 50% of over 60,000 women who visited their clinics in 2016 for an abortion reported using at least one form of contraception when they got pregnant. 1

Ethinylestradiol (EE) is a key active ingredient used in a variety of combined oral contraceptive (COC) formulations. Since the introduction of COCs in the 1960s, the dose of EE in the pill has been reduced due to increased risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVD), including thromboembolism and myocardial infarction, particularly in women with other predisposing factors such as smoking and obesity. Although the exact mechanism contributing to the increased CVD risk remains unclear, the use of newer low‐dose formulations of COC (EE dose ≤ 35 μg) has resulted in a significant decrease in the risk of CVD. 2 Thus, guidelines issued by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) advocate the safety and non‐CVD risk of COCs containing < 50 μg EE in women younger than 35 years including those with preexisting but well‐controlled hypertension, provided no other CVD risk factors are present. It is also recommended as a safe option in older women > 35 years until 50–55 years. Caution is however advised in the use of COC formulations in women > 35 years who smoke, as well as in women with dyslipidemia, where it has been suggested that an alternative nonhormonal contraceptive be used. 3 In fact, a recent US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidance contraindicates the use of COCs in smokers > 35 years. 4

### Oral contraceptive pills and hypertension: a review of current evidence and recommendations [^111nsPnT]. Hypertension (2023). Medium credibility.

Oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) have been used as effective and popular forms of contraception since the middle of the last century. By 2019, over 150 million reproductive-aged individuals were using OCPs to prevent unintended pregnancies worldwide. Safety concerns regarding the effects of OCPs on blood pressure were reported soon after these pills gained approval. Although OCP doses were subsequently reduced, epidemiologic evidence continued to support a smaller, but significant association between OCPs and hypertension. Given the rising prevalence of hypertension, as well as the adverse effects of cumulative exposure to blood pressure elevations on cardiovascular disease risk, understanding the nature of the association between OCPs and hypertension is important for clinicians and patients to assess the risks and benefits of use, and make individualized decisions regarding contraception. Therefore, this review summarizes the current and historical evidence describing the association between OCP use and blood pressure elevations. Specifically, it identifies the pathophysiologic mechanisms linking OCPs to hypertension risk, describes the magnitude of the association between OCPs and blood pressure elevations, and distinguishes the effects of various OCP types on blood pressure. Finally, it describes current recommendations regarding hypertension and OCP use, as well as identifies strategies, such as over-the-counter OCP prescribing, to safely and equitably improve access to oral contraception.

### Blood pressure measurement prior to initiating hormonal contraception: a systematic review [^112axWcf]. Contraception (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Women with hypertension who use hormonal methods of contraception may have an increased risk for cardiovascular events. This review was conducted to evaluate the evidence regarding whether blood pressure should be measured prior to initiating hormonal contraceptives.

Study Design

The PubMed database was searched from database inception through March 2012 for all peer-reviewed articles in any language concerning blood pressure measurement prior to initiation of hormonal contraceptives. Articles were included if they reported on women with and without blood pressure measurement prior to current hormonal contraceptive usage and assessed cardiovascular outcomes. The quality of each study was assessed using the United States Preventive Services Task Force grading system.

Results

Six fair-quality articles from three studies met inclusion criteria for this review. Three case-control studies showed that women who did not have blood pressure measurement prior to initiating combined oral contraceptives (COCs) had a higher risk for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) than women who did have blood pressure measurement. Two case-control studies showed that women who did not have blood pressure measurement prior to initiating COCs had a higher risk for ischemic stroke than women who did have blood pressure measurement. One case-control study showed no difference in the risk for hemorrhagic stroke among women who initiated COCs based on whether or not blood pressure was measured.

Conclusions

Fair-quality evidence from five reports showed that women who did not have blood pressure measurement prior to COC initiation had a higher risk for AMI and ischemic stroke than women who did have blood pressure measurement. One fair-quality study showed no increased risk for hemorrhagic stroke based on whether or not blood pressure was measured. Studies that examined hormonal contraceptive methods other than COCs were not identified.

### Approach to the patient: contraception in women with polycystic ovary syndrome [^115kDTyM]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Low credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common reproductive and metabolic disorder. Patients with PCOS present with clinical signs of androgen excess (ie, hirsutism and acne), menstrual irregularities, and infertility. Combined oral contraceptive (OC) pills are the first-line medical therapy for the long-term management of PCOS. Containing a combination of estrogen and progestin, OCs restore regular menses, improve androgen excess, and provide effective contraception and protection from endometrial cancer. The benefits of hormonal contraception outweigh the risks in the vast majority of women with PCOS. However, concerns have been raised about potential adverse cardiovascular and metabolic effects of OCs. Currently available evidence indicates an increased relative risk of venous thrombosis associated with OCs varying among different formulations. Arterial thrombosis risk attributable to OCs does not appear to be significantly increased in young nonsmoking women. OC use might be associated with increased risk of diabetes in morbidly obese women with PCOS with severe insulin resistance. A tailored clinical approach to oral contraception in women with PCOS requires individualized risk stratification and management by determination of each PCOS patient's personal cardiometabolic risk profile at baseline and during follow-up. Before prescribing an OC, clinicians should document individual risk factors including age, smoking, obesity, any degree of glucose intolerance including prediabetes and diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, thrombophilia, and personal or family history of a venous thromboembolic event.

Composite cardiovascular disease

Preterm birth, pre-eclampsia, and stillbirth were associated with a twofold increase in the risk of composite cardiovascular disease; premature ovarian insufficiency, placental abruption, gestational hypertension, and gestational diabetes mellitus were associated with a 1.5–1.9-fold increase in the risk; and polycystic ovary syndrome, early menopause, early menarche, and ever parity were associated with a less than 1.5-fold increase in risk. Breastfeeding for longer was associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease. The forest plot (fig 4) shows the results for reviews that conducted a meta-analysis.

WARNING: CIGARETTE SMOKING AND SERIOUS CARDIOVASCULAR EVENTS

Cigarette smoking increases the risk of serious cardiovascular events from combination oral contraceptives (COC) use. This risk increases with age, particularly in women over 35 years of age, and with the number of cigarettes smoked. For this reason, COCs should not be used by women who are over 35 years of age and smoke [see Contraindications (4)].

### Associations of oral contraceptive use with cardiovascular disease and all-cause death: evidence from the UK biobank cohort study [^114kvZx7]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Biological Plausibility

Several potential mechanisms could explain the observed relationships between OC use and the incidence of CVD as well as death. First, OCs are mainly a combination of different formulations and doses of estrogen and progestin. OC use is significantly related to multiple CVD risk factors, including lipoproteins, blood pressure, glucose tolerance, and diabetes. The effects of OC use on serum lipid profiles primarily result from estrogen‐receptor–mediated effects on the hepatic expression of apoprotein genes. Estrogen reduces low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol oxidation and binding and platelet aggregation, and increases cyclooxygenase‐2 activity. Clinical studies also showed that some types of OCs produced lower blood pressure and no adverse effects on glucose. Second, OC administration can directly prevent atherosclerosis in animal models, which is the leading cause of subsequent CVD events. Accordingly, this may be another mechanism that could explain the benefits for CVD events derived from OC use. In addition, OC has evolved through time and begun to more closely resemble endogenous molecules, which may further decrease thrombotic effects. Consistently, our analysis showed that OC use did not increase the risk of subsequent CVD events, and the risk may decrease when the duration of OC use is > 1 year.

In addition, OCs help to ameliorate countless ailments, including dysmenorrhea, fibroid‐related symptoms, acne, and premenstrual dysphoric disorder. Extensive evidence showed that disruption of ovulatory cycling, indicated by estrogen deficiency and hypothalamic dysfunction, or irregular menstrual cycling in premenopausal women may increase the risk of coronary atherosclerosis and CVD events. Therefore, OC use may be beneficial for CVD events since it plays a protective role in improving the above reproductive disorders. In light of death analyses, OC use can reduce the risks of uterine body cancer, ovarian cancer, and maternal death. Indeed, other mechanisms might also be involved. Future investigations are needed to explore the functional roles and mechanisms of OC use in cardiovascular health.

### Combined oral contraceptives: the risk of myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke [^113GEGAN]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Combined oral contraceptives (COCs) have been associated with an increased risk of arterial thrombosis, i.e. myocardial infarction or ischemic stroke. However, as these diseases are rare in young women and as many types of combined oral contraception exist, the magnitude of the risk and the effect of different hormonal contents of COC preparations remain unclear.

Objectives

To estimate the risk of myocardial infarction or ischemic stroke in users compared with non-users of different types, doses and generations of combined oral contraception.

Search Methods

We searched electronic databases (MEDLINE (1966 to July 08, 2015), EMBASE (1980 to July 08, 2015), Popline (1970 to July 08, 2015) and LILACS (1985 to July 08, 2015) for eligible studies, without language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We included observational studies that recruited women in the reproductive age group (18 to 50 years) and compared the risk of myocardial infarction or ischemic stroke between users and non-users of COCs.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected relevant studies and extracted data. We pooled relative risks ()(combined odds ratios and one incidence rate ratio) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for myocardial infarction or ischemic stroke in users versus non-users of COCs. We combined the outcomes of myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke and also analysed these outcomes separately. Analyses were stratified according to estrogen dose and progestagen type.

Main Results

In total, we identified 1298 publications through the search strategy. We included 28 publications reporting on 24 studies. COC users were at increased risk of myocardial infarction or ischemic stroke compared with non-users: relative risk (RR) 1.6 (95% CI 1.3–1.9). These RRs were similar for myocardial infarction (1.6, 95% CI 1.2 to 2.1) and ischemic stroke (1.7, 95% CI 1.5 to 1.9). The risks did not vary clearly according to the generation of progestagen or according to progestagen type. When we stratified preparations according to estrogen dose, the risk of myocardial infarction or ischemic stroke seemed to increase with higher doses of estrogen.

Authors' Conclusions

This meta-analysis showed that the risk of myocardial infarction or ischemic stroke was 1.6-fold increased in women using COCs. The risk was highest for pills with > 50 microgram estrogen. When combined with the results of studies on the risk of venous thrombosis in COC users, it seems that the COC pill containing levonorgestrel and 30 μg of estrogen is the safest oral form of hormonal contraception.

### Contraception and cardiovascular disease [^1121qcJ9]. European Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Contraceptive counselling should begin early in females with heart disease, preferably directly after the start of menstruation. In coming to a decision about the method of contraception, the following issues should be considered: (i) the risk of pregnancy for the mother and the consequences of an unplanned pregnancy; (ii) the risks of the contraceptive method; (iii) failure rates; (iv) the non-contraceptive benefits; (v) the availability; (vi) the individual's preferences; (vii) protection against infection; and (viii) costs. In some women with heart disease, the issues may be complex and require the input of both a cardiologist and an obstetrician (or other feto-maternal expert) to identify the optimal approach. No studies have been performed in women with heart disease to investigate the relative risks and benefits of different contraceptive methods.

Table 2
Safety and Efficacy of Contraceptive Methods by High‐Risk Cardiac Disease

Tier II contraception includes different formulations of combined hormonal contraceptives, including the pill, patch, or ring, as well as the progestin‐only pill and depot medroxyprogesterone acetate injection. All estrogen‐containing contraceptive options are associated with risk of increase in blood pressure, fluid retention, cholesterol levels, and thrombogenic profile, making them less favorable options among patients with elevated thromboembolic risk, including severe left ventricular dysfunction (left ventricular ejection fraction < 30%), pulmonary arterial hypertension, severe mitral stenosis, mechanical valves, and complex congenital heart disease including Fontan circulation. Combined hormonal contraceptives should also generally be avoided in patients with uncontrolled hypertension, ischemic disease, and thoracic aortic disease due to mild increases in blood pressure (6–8 mm Hg) associated with estrogen. Expert consensus also recommends against the use of combined hormonal contraceptives in patients with a history of spontaneous coronary artery dissection.

In general, progestin‐only contraceptive methods have a significantly lower risk of thromboembolism as compared with estrogen‐containing contraceptives. Depot medroxyprogesterone acetate has been associated with a potential increased risk of thromboembolism in some studies. Thus, for patients with ischemic heart disease or a history of stroke, the use of depot medroxyprogesterone acetate should be avoided if possible. Other side effects to consider for appropriateness of use are the risks of weight gain, reversible bone loss, and delayed return to fertility. Although the progestin‐only pill is not associated with an increased cardiovascular risk profile, it requires strict daily adherence for optimal efficacy, although newer formulations may offer more convenience and flexibility. Of note, the recently US Food and Drug Administration–approved over‐the‐counter contraception pill norgestrel is a progestin‐only pill. Additionally, endothelial receptor antagonists commonly used to treat pulmonary hypertension may reduce the efficacy of both CHC as well as progestin‐only methods and should prompt consideration of multiple synergistic methods of contraception. Given significantly high failure rates, fertility awareness and barrier methods alone (Tier III) are not recommended for use among patients with exceptionally high maternal and/or fetal risks of pregnancy.

DETAILED PATIENT LABELING

This product (like all oral contraceptives) is intended to prevent pregnancy. It does not protect against HIV infection (AIDS) and other sexually transmitted diseases. PLEASE NOTE: This labeling is revised from time to time as important new medical information becomes available. Therefore, please review this labeling carefully.

The following oral contraceptive product contains a combination of a progestogen and estrogen, the two kinds of female hormones:

Cyred EQ (Desogestrel and Ethinyl Estradiol Tablets USP)

Each white to off-white tablet contains 0.15 mg desogestrel and 0.03 mg ethinyl estradiol. Each green tablet contains inert ingredients.

INTRODUCTION

Any woman who considers using oral contraceptives (the birth control pill or the pill) should understand the benefits and risks of using this form of birth control. This patient labeling will give you much of the information you will need to make this decision and will also help you determine if you are at risk of developing any of the serious side effects of the pill. It will tell you how to use the pill properly so that it will be as effective as possible. However, this labeling is not a replacement for a careful discussion between you and your healthcare professional. You should discuss the information provided in this labeling with him or her, both when you first start taking the pill and during your revisits. You should also follow your healthcare professional's advice with regard to regular check-ups while you are on the pill.

EFFECTIVENESS OF ORAL CONTRACEPTIVES

Oral contraceptives or "birth control pills" or "the pill" are used to prevent pregnancy and are more effective than most other non-surgical methods of birth control. When they are taken correctly without missing any pills, the chance of becoming pregnant is approximately 1% (1 pregnancy per 100 women per year of use). Typical failure rates, including women who do not always take the pills exactly as directed, are approximately 5% per year. The chance of becoming pregnant increases with each missed pill during a menstrual cycle.

In comparison, typical failure rates for other non-surgical methods of birth control during the first year of use are as follows:

WHO SHOULD NOT TAKE ORAL CONTRACEPTIVES

Do not use Cyred EQ if you smoke cigarettes and are over 35 years old. Smoking increases your risk of serious cardiovascular side effects (heart and blood vessel problems) from combination oral contraceptives, including death from heart attack, blood clots or stroke. This risk increases with age and the number of cigarettes you smoke.

### U.S. medical eligibility criteria for contraceptive use, 2024 [^112a6VCd]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2024). High credibility.

Combined hormonal contraceptives (CHCs) — hypertension: Hypertension is flagged for pregnancy-related risk where systolic blood pressure ≥ 160 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 100 mm Hg are associated with increased risk for adverse health events. Adequately controlled hypertension is category 3. Clarification states that for all categories of hypertension, classifications assume no other risk factors; multiple risk factors might increase risk substantially, and a single reading is not sufficient to classify a person. Persons adequately treated for hypertension are at reduced risk for acute myocardial infarction and stroke compared with untreated persons, and although no data exist, COC users with adequately controlled and monitored hypertension should be at reduced risk compared with untreated hypertensive COC users. Evidence indicates that among women with hypertension, COC users were at higher risk than nonusers for stroke, acute myocardial infarction, and peripheral arterial disease, and discontinuation of COCs in women with hypertension might improve blood pressure control. Elevated blood pressure levels are categorized as i. Systolic 140–159 mm Hg or diastolic 90–99 mm Hg: category 3; ii. Systolic ≥ 160 mm Hg or diastolic ≥ 100 mm Hg: category 4; and c. Vascular disease: category 4.

a. Myocardial Infarction

An increased risk of myocardial infarction has been attributed to oral contraceptive use. This risk is primarily in smokers or women with other underlying risk factors for coronary artery disease such as hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, morbid obesity and diabetes.2–5, 13The relative risk of heart attack for current oral contraceptive users has been estimated to be 2 to 6.2, 14–19The risk is very low under the age of 30. However, there is the possibility of a risk of cardiovascular disease even in very young women who take oral contraceptives.

Smoking in combination with oral contraceptive use has been shown to contribute substantially to the incidence of myocardial infarctions in women in their mid-thirties or older, with smoking accounting for the majority of excess cases.20

Mortality rates associated with circulatory disease have been shown to increase substantially in smokers over the age of 35 and non-smokers over the age of 40 among women who use oral contraceptives (see Table II).16

Oral contraceptives may compound the effects of well-known risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemias, hypercholesterolemia, age and obesity.3, 13, 21In particular, some progestogens are known to decrease HDL cholesterol and cause glucose intolerance, while estrogens may create a state of hyperinsulinism.21–25Oral contraceptives have been shown to increase blood pressure among users (see WARNINGS, section 9). Similar effects on risk factors have been associated with an increased risk of heart disease. Oral contraceptives must be used with caution in women with cardiovascular disease risk factors.

### U.S. selected practice recommendations for contraceptive use, 2024 [^116R6py5]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2024). High credibility.

Combined hormonal contraceptives (CHCs) — lipid screening — Screening for dyslipidemias is not necessary for the safe initiation of CHCs because of the low likelihood of clinically significant changes with use of hormonal contraceptives; a systematic review did not identify any evidence regarding outcomes among women who were screened versus not screened with lipid measurement before initiation of hormonal contraceptives. During 2015–2016 among women aged 20–39 years in the United States, 6.7% had high cholesterol, defined as total serum cholesterol ≥ 240 mg/dL. Few poor-quality studies suggest that women with known dyslipidemias using CHCs might be at increased risk for myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, or venous thromboembolism compared with women without dyslipidemias, no studies were identified that examined risk for pancreatitis, and studies have reported mixed results on lipid levels with unclear clinical significance.

### Contemporary menopausal hormone therapy and risk of cardiovascular disease: Swedish nationwide register based emulated target trial [^115qt1Ff]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

Two decades have passed since the publication of the HERS and the Women's Health Initiative trials. Since then, new menopausal hormone therapy products with different formulations and routes of administration have been introduced to the market. Both the HERS and the Women's Health Initiative investigated the risk of cardiovascular disease associated with only one type of menopausal hormone therapy, specifically oral conjugated equine oestrogen combined with medroxyprogesterone acetate. In addition, HERS and the Women's Health Initiative included women with an average age of 67 and 63, respectively, which is not the typical timing for starting menopausal hormone therapy today. A critical need exists for further studies to investigate the effects of contemporary menopausal hormone therapy in a clinically relevant population.

To tackle the gaps in the knowledge on use of contemporary menopausal hormone therapy and risk of cardiovascular disease, this paper reports the findings from a Swedish nationwide register based emulated target trial including 919 614 women aged 50–58 years. This age range represents the typical span during which women undergo the menopausal transition — a period marked by significant hormonal changes and when most women start menopausal hormone therapy. We explored a variety of menopausal hormone therapy formulations, including oral and transdermal options, combined therapies with progestin, oestrogen-only treatments, and tibolone. These diverse options mirror the range of choices available in clinical practice, tailored to meet the needs and preferences of individual patients. Different hormone administration methods are thought to have distinct physiological effects. Oral oestrogens increase production of coagulation factor, suggested to have a less favourable cardiovascular risk profile, whereas transdermal administration bypasses the liver and is believed to be a better option. The addition of progestins in combined preparations may increase the oestrogenicity and, therefore, the risk of thrombosis.

By clearly defining the target trial protocol and its observational emulation, we ensured eligibility and treatment alignment from the start, preventing selection bias by excluding prevalent users at baseline. We aimed to estimate the average treatment effect for ischaemic heart disease, cerebral infarction, myocardial infarction, and venous thromboembolism with the use of different types of contemporary menopausal hormone therapy.

### 2024 guideline for the primary prevention of stroke: a guideline from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^115Yruv2]. Stroke (2024). High credibility.

Combined hormonal contraception (CHC) — age and risk factor interactions are described, with marked age-related increases and synergistic effects. With CHC, stroke risk increased with age, growing from 3.4 to 64.4 events per 100 000 person-years for individuals 15 to 49 years of age, and risk is higher especially when 35 years of age is used as a cutoff. CHC synergistically increases the risk of hypertension up to 4-fold, smoking up to 3-fold, and migraine with aura up to 6-fold, and higher estrogen doses significantly increased the risk of stroke in those who smoke. Progestin-only contraception in all routes is not associated with an overall increased stroke risk, but in the setting of hypertension progestin-only contraception can increase stroke risk. In RATIO data, higher risk of stroke in women with cardiovascular risk factors than women without was seen in combinations containing 30 μg of estrogen plus second or third-generation progestins, whereas the different generations of progestin stroke risk did not differ in women without stroke risk factors.

### Investigation and management of resistant hypertension: British and Irish hypertension society position statement [^112K8yim]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

Hormone Therapy The association between combined oral contraceptives (CoC) and hypertension is well-recognised, with studies showing a dose-dependent relationship with oestrogen strength. Proposed mechanisms include increased oestrogen-mediated corticosteroid binding globulin resulting in raised cortisol, and upregulation of the RAAS system. This risk is not seen with Progesterone-only Pills (PoP). Contraceptive options for hypertensive women include non-hormonal options, PoP and Intra-Uterine Devices (IUD). Newer formulations containing natural oestrogens and progestins with anti-mineralocorticoid effects may mitigate this link with high BP. Transdermal oestrogens, commonly prescribed for menopausal symptoms may be less likely to induce hypertension than oral oestrogens. Low levels of androgens in men and increased levels of androgens in women, as occurs with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), are both associated with increased risk for cardiovascular disease and elevated BP. The link between gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT) and hypertension requires further investigation. Anabolic steroids are often used illicitly to increase muscle bulk and power and are associated with an 8 mmHg increase in BP, a threefold increase in the prevalence of hypertension, and increased aortic stiffness.

Erythropoietin Twenty to thirty per cent of people given recombinant human erythropoietin to correct anaemia in malignancies and end-stage renal disease may have hypertension induced or exacerbated within 2 to 16 weeks of starting treatment. While polycythaemia is a recognised risk factor for hypertension (e.g. Gaisböck syndrome), erythropoietin has been shown to cause hypertension independently from elevated hematocrit. Among the proposed mechanisms are nitric oxide resistance and an increase in cytoplasmatic ionised calcium. In these individuals, calcium channel blockers are the pharmacological agent of choice.

Growth Factor Inhibitors This class of agents includes Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) inhibitors that inhibit tumour angiogenesis such as bevacizumab and pazopanib, the latter of which also inhibits platelet derived growth factor (PDGF). Inhibition of VEGF prevents the phosphorylation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase, a potent vasodilator. A recent meta-analysis showed that use of these agents was associated with an increased risk of hypertension. In other studies, the risk was demonstrated to be dose dependent. Indeed, the strong relationship between hypertension and VEGF inhibition may be useful as a biomarker of drug effect. Within this class are the Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors (TKIs) that are involved in the VEGF signalling pathway. Many of these anti-cancer agents are used as targeted therapy in solid organ cancers. Examples of TKIs that result in arterial hypertension due to epidermal growth factor (EGF) inhibition are gefitinib and lenvatinib.

### Prospective measurement of blood pressure and heart rate over 24 h in women using combined oral contraceptives with estradiol [^111gwWLj]. Contraception (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

Combined oral contraceptives (COCs) containing ethinyl-estradiol are known to increase blood pressure (BP). We evaluated whether COCs containing estradiol (E2) influence 24-h ambulatory BP and heart rate (HR) in normotensive and normal-weight women.

Study Design

Twenty-four-hour BP and HR were measured every 30 min with an ambulatory BP device in 18 normotensive healthy non-smoking women prior to (Days 3–6 of menstrual cycle) and after 6 months of use (Days 20–24 of cycle 6) of a COC containing either a quadriphasic combination of E2 valerate plus dienogest (n = 11) or a monophasic association of micronized E2 plus nomegestrol acetate (n = 7).

Results

Mean age and body mass index of the final sample were 32.50 ± 7.49 years and 22.87 ± 4.08, respectively. E2-based COCs induced no modification of 24-h systolic BP (+1.65 ± 8.34 mmHg; p = .41), diastolic BP (+0.04 ± 7.36 mmHg; p = .98), mean BP (+0.64 ± 6.42 mmHg; p = .68) or HR (-0.72 ± 5.86 beats/min; p = .61). Differences were not observed even when daytime or nighttime values were separately considered. Though this was not a comparative study, we did not find differences between the effects of the two formulations (24-h mean BP; p = .699).

Conclusions

These data suggest a neutral effect of estradiol-based COCs on independent risk factors for cardiovascular diseases such as BP or HR.

Implications

BP and HR of normotensive women are not increased by E2-based COCs.

Exogenous hormone therapies, such as combined oral contraceptives (COC) and hormone replacement therapy (HRT), cause blood hypercoagulability and are a risk factor for venous thromboembolism (VTE). There is controversy on how strong this "provoking" risk factor is, and how other risk factors may synergise VTE risk. We aim to review the latest literature on the risk of initial and recurrent VTE with COC and HRT use to provide guidance for decision-making about duration of anticoagulation, and guide future research efforts.

Stratified analyses were performed according to the duration of OC use into 4 intervals (≤ 1 year, 1–5 years, 5–10 years, or > 10 years), BMI (< 30 kg/m² or ≥ 30 kg/m²), current smoker (yes or no), physical activity (low, moderate, or high), parity (0, 1, or ≥ 2), age at menarche (< 14 years or ≥ 14 years), age at OC use (≤ 18 years, 19–24 years, or 25–55 years), history of hypertension (yes or no), history of diabetes (yes or no), hypertriglyceridemia (yes or no), menstrual cycle (regular or irregular), and C‐reactive protein (< 3.0 mg/dL, or ≥ 3.0 mg/dL). The potential effect modification was examined using the interaction models to investigate whether the associations between OC use and cardiovascular outcomes as well as death differed by these stratification variables. Sensitivity analyses were performed by excluding participants who developed CVD events during the first 2 years of follow‐up, including hormone replacement therapy users at baseline, and excluding those who were aged > 60 years at baseline. In addition, we conducted further analyses after propensity score matching.

### U.S. selected practice recommendations for contraceptive use, 2024 [^115AMsK4]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2024). High credibility.

Combined hormonal contraceptives (CHCs) — examinations and tests before initiation among healthy patients are few; blood pressure should be measured before initiation of combined hormonal contraceptives, and baseline weight and body mass index (BMI) measurements might be useful for addressing concerns about weight changes over time; patients with known medical problems or special conditions might need additional examinations or tests, and U.S. MEC might be useful in such circumstances.

### Norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol (Nylia 7 / 7 / 7) [^116uo4ps]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Minimizing exposure to estrogen and progestogen is in keeping with good principles of therapeutics. For any particular estrogen/progestogen combination, the dosage regimen prescribed should be one which contains the least amount of estrogen and progestogen that is compatible with a low failure rate and the needs of the individual patient. New acceptors of oral contraceptive agents should be started on preparations containing the lowest estrogen content which is judged appropriate for the individual patient.

e. Persistence of risk of vascular disease

There are two studies which have shown persistence of risk of vascular disease for ever-users of oral contraceptives. In a study in the United States, the risk of developing myocardial infarction after discontinuing oral contraceptives persists for at least 9 years for women 40 to 49 years who had used oral contraceptives for five or more years, but this increased risk was not demonstrated in other age groups.8In another study in Great Britain, the risk of developing cerebrovascular disease persisted for at least 6 years after discontinuation of oral contraceptives, although excess risk was very small.34However, both studies were performed with oral contraceptive formulations containing 50 micrograms or higher of estrogens.

2.000000000000000e+00 Estimates of Mortality from Contraceptive Use

One study gathered data from a variety of sources which have estimated the mortality rate associated with different methods of contraception at different ages (Table 2). These estimates include the combined risk of death associated with contraceptive methods plus the risk attributable to pregnancy in the event of method failure. Each method of contraception has its specific benefits and risks. The study concluded that with the exception of oral contraceptive users 35 and older who smoke, and 40 and older who do not smoke, mortality associated with all methods of birth control is low and below that associated with childbirth. The observation of an increase in risk of mortality with age for oral contraceptive users is based on data gathered in the 1970's.35Current clinical recommendation involves the use of lower estrogen dose formulations and a careful consideration of risk factors. In 1989, the Fertility and Maternal Health Drugs Advisory Committee was asked to review the use of oral contraceptives in women 40 years of age and over. The Committee concluded that although cardiovascular disease risks may be increased with oral contraceptive use after age 40 in healthy non-smoking women (even with the newer low-dose formulations), there are also greater potential health risks associated with pregnancy in older women and with the alternative surgical and medical procedures which may be necessary if such women do not have access to effective and acceptable means of contraception. The Committee recommended that the benefits of low-dose oral contraceptive use by healthy non-smoking women over 40 may outweigh the possible risks.

### U.S. selected practice recommendations for contraceptive use, 2024 [^11644TZL]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2024). High credibility.

Combined hormonal contraceptives — routine follow-up after initiation — do not require a routine follow-up visit for healthy users; at follow-up, providers should assess satisfaction, health status changes (including medications) per U.S. MEC, blood pressure, and consider weight changes; more frequent visits might benefit adolescents and those with certain or multiple medical conditions; no evidence shows that a routine visit improves correct or continued CHC use, monitoring blood pressure is important, providers might recommend obtaining blood pressure measurements in other settings (including self-measured), and a systematic review identified five studies examining hypertension incidence among new COC users versus nonhormonal or placebo comparators.

Boxed warnings regarding the use of progesterone PO (also known as Prometrium, Crinone):

- **Cardiovascular mortality**: estrogens plus progestin therapy should not be used for the prevention of CVD or dementia.
- **DVT, PE, myocardial infarction**: use extreme caution in patients on estrogen plus progestin therapy.
- **Exacerbation of breast cancer**: progestins with estrogens should be prescribed at the lowest effective doses and for the shortest duration consistent with treatment goals and risks for the individual woman.

### Guideline no. 422e: menopause and cardiovascular disease [^116QZs7m]. Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Canada (2021). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for menopause, more specifically with respect to management of cardiovascular risks, SOGC 2021 guidelines recommend to use the lowest effective dose of estrogen, and, where indicated, estrogen-only therapy when prescribing menopausal hormone therapy to minimize the associated risk of VTE.

### A combined oral contraceptive containing drospirenone changes neither endothelial function nor hemodynamic parameters in healthy young women: a prospective clinical trial [^116QJ7i9]. Contraception (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Combined oral contraceptives (COCs) may lead to a rise in cardiovascular disease risk, possibly associated with changes in blood pressure and endothelial function.

Study Design

The objective was to evaluate the impact of COC containing 20 mcg of ethinylestradiol (EE) and 3 mg of drospirenone (DRSP) on the arterial endothelial function, systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP, respectively), heart rate (HR), cardiac output (CO) and total peripheral resistance (TPR) of healthy young women. Of the 71 women in the study, 43 were evaluated before the introduction of COC and after 6 months of its use (case group) and 28, COC nonusers, were assessed for the same parameters at the same time interval (control group).

Results

No significant changes in endothelium-dependent and endothelium-independent functions or in measures of SBP, DBP, HR, CO and TPR caused by COC use were observed in the case group (p > .05 for all variables) or in the control group.

Conclusion

These data suggest COC with 20 mcg EE and 3 mg DRSP does not alter arterial endothelial function or hemodynamic parameters in healthy young women.

### Contemporary menopausal hormone therapy and risk of cardiovascular disease: Swedish nationwide register based emulated target trial [^115CAkVi]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

Meaning of study

A need has existed to re-evaluate the risk of cardiovascular disease associated with contemporary menopausal hormone therapy in women around the age of menopausal transition when menopausal hormone therapy is usually initiated. The feasibility of randomised trials to support decision making is particularly limited if the goal is to estimate effects in subgroups of women, such as those using different types of treatment. This study was specifically designed to avoid selection bias commonly seen in observational studies by emulating a target trial and to overcome the limitations of randomised trials by examining various types of menopausal hormone therapy products.

Unanswered questions and future research

The study did not extend to the effects of specific progestins within these therapy formulations. Bioidentical progesterone, compared with synthetic progesterone (progestin), has been suggested to confer different risk profiles regarding cardiovascular disease. Hence, future research should investigate the potential various effects on the risk of cardiovascular disease based on different progestogens used in menopausal hormone therapy.

### Does the progestogen used in combined hormonal contraception affect venous thrombosis risk? [^113cDRmF]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Combined hormonal contraceptives (CHCs) use a combination of estrogen and progestogen to provide contraception. The most important risk of using CHCs is venous thromboembolism (VTE). It is unclear whether the type of progestogen used in a method augments that risk. Although the evidence supporting an increase in thrombosis risk is not conclusive, neither is the evidence supporting the benefit of newer progestogens in terms of tolerability or continuation. The benefits of CHCs outweigh the risks and the absolute risk of VTE remains small. A balanced discussion of potential risks and benefits of particular CHC formulations is warranted during contraception counseling.

### Cardiovascular risks of combined oral contraceptive use… [^1142JRFV]. AAFP (2012). Low credibility.

Clinical Question What are the risks of combined oral contraceptive use in patients with cardiovascular risk factors. Evidence-Based Answer Because of an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, the use of combined oral contraceptives should be considered carefully in women who smoke and in those with hypertension or hyperlipidemia. Combined OC use in patients with hypertension may increase the risk of peripheral arterial disease. A systematic review with three case-control studies found mixed outcomes for women with hypertension who are using OCs and the risk of acute myocardial infarction.

3 According to a risk model developed from this study using baseline MI and stroke rates from multiple countries, women with hypertension who are 20 to 24 years of age will have an additional four MIs and ischemic strokes per 100, 000 years of OC use; those 30 to 34 years of age will have an additional seven; and those 40 to 44 years of age will have an additional 29.
4. PERIPHERAL ARTERIAL DISEASE A case-control study of 152 women with angiographically diagnosed peripheral arterial disease found that women with hypertension who used OCs were more likely to develop peripheral arterial disease compared with those who did not use OCs.
5. HYPERLIPIDEMIA A case-control study found that patients with hyperlipidemia who used OCs were more likely to have an ischemic stroke than those with hyperlipidemia who did not.

Another case-control study found that patients with hyperlipidemia who used OCs had an increased risk of MI compared with women with hyperlipidemia who did not use OCs. 7 Both studies compared outcomes in cases against baseline outcome rates in women without hyperlipidemia who did not use OCs.

### The risk of MI and ischemic stroke with combined oral… [^1173gNky]. AAFP (2016). Low credibility.

Clinical Question Do combined oral contraceptives increase the risk of myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke. Evidence-Based Answer The overall risk of MI and ischemic stroke is increased in women who use combined oral contraceptives. The relative risk of MI and ischemic stroke increases as estrogen dose rises, increasing by 60% with doses of 20 mcg and more than doubling when doses of 50 mcg or more are used. Risk of MI and ischemic stroke does not vary with the type or generation of progestin. Physicians should be cautious when prescribing combined oral contraceptives because of the increased risk of MI and ischemic stroke. This Cochrane review included 24 observational studies in a meta-analysis comparing the risk of fatal or nonfatal MI or ischemic stroke between users and nonusers, 18 to 50 years of age, of combined oral contraceptives of varying generations, types, and doses.

The generation and type varied according to the progestin included, and the dose varied according to the estrogen formulation. The overall combined risk of MI and ischemic stroke was increased for users of combined oral contraceptives when compared with nonusers. The risks of MI alone and ischemic stroke alone were also similarly increased. There were no differences in the risk of MI or ischemic stroke based on progestin type or generation. Because the analysis included mostly raw data, confounding by age, body mass index, smoking, and calendar time cannot be ruled out. However, all but one of the studies were case-control designs that employed matching to adjust for age and calendar time. Previous systematic reviews have found an increased association with MI and ischemic stroke among combined oral contraceptive users.

This Cochrane review complements and strengthens these findings with more stringent inclusion criteria. The U. S. Medical Eligibility Criteria for Contraceptive Use provides guidance on safe contraceptive use for women by underlying medical condition. 3 The US MEC limits its recommendations for combined oral contraceptive use to formulations containing no more than 35 mcg of ethinyl estradiol and states that combined oral contraceptive use in women with multiple major risk factors for cardiovascular disease may increase health risks to an unacceptable level. 3 These guidelines also state that combined oral contraceptive use in patients with a personal history of ischemic heart disease or stroke is contraindicated.

### Does smoking contribute to… [^111vfbsg]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

Does Smoking Contribute to Heart Disease. Yes, smoking cigarettes can harm nearly any part of your body, including your heart and blood vessels. When breathed in, the toxic mix of more than 7, 000 chemicals 1 in cigarette smoke can interfere with important processes in your body that keep it functioning normally. One of these processes is the delivery of oxygen-rich blood to your heart and the rest of your body. What Cardiovascular Conditions Can Result from Smoking. Smoking cigarettes can permanently damage your heart and blood vessels. This can lead to cardiovascular disease. Cardiovascular disease refers to multiple conditions affecting the heart and/or blood vessels. 3 Some of these conditions include:

- Coronary heart disease, or the narrowing of blood vessels carrying blood to the heart.
- Hypertension.
- Heart attack.
- Stroke.
- Aneurysms.
- Peripheral artery disease.

1, 2 Smoking cigarettes can also cause CVD by changing your blood chemistry. 1, 2 These changes in blood chemistry can cause plaque — a waxy substance comprised of cholesterol, scar tissue, calcium, fat, and other material 3 — to build up in your arteries, the major blood vessels that carry blood from your heart to your body. This plaque buildup can lead to a disease called atherosclerosis. When the chemicals in cigarette smoke cause atherosclerosis and thickened blood in the arteries, it becomes more difficult for blood cells to move through arteries and other blood vessels to get to vital organs like the heart and brain. 4 This can create blood clots and ultimately lead to a heart attack or stroke, even death. 1, 2. Can Secondhand Smoke Increase My Risk for Coronary Heart Disease. While smoking is a direct cause of cardiovascular disease and death, you could be at risk even if you don't smoke cigarettes.

People who don't smoke cigarettes but who are regularly exposed to secondhand smoke have a 25 to 30 percent increased risk of coronary heart disease than those not exposed. 6 In fact, 30, 000 U. S. coronary heart disease deaths per year are caused by secondhand smoke. 7 Secondhand smoke exposure also increases your risk of having a heart attack or stroke. 6, 7.

### Health effects of cigarettes: cardiovascular disease… [^112QKfRm]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Heart disease includes several types of heart conditions. In the United States, the most common type of heart disease is coronary heart disease. CHD is also known as coronary artery disease. CHD is caused by plaque buildup in the walls of the arteries that carry blood to the heart. Plaque is made up of deposits of cholesterol and other substances. It can cause the arteries to narrow over time. This process is called atherosclerosis. CHD can cause:

- Chest pain
- Heart attack
- Heart failure
- Arrhythmia. Smoking and cardiovascular disease Smoking is a major cause of CVD, causing one in every four deaths from CVD.

Smoking can:

- Raise triglycerides
- Lower "good" cholesterol
- Make blood sticky and more likely to clot, which can block blood flow to the heart and brain
- Damage cells that line the blood vessels
- Increase the buildup of plaque in blood vessels
- Cause thickening and narrowing of blood vessels. Smoking increases the risk of many CVDs including:

- Atherosclerosis
- Coronary heart disease, including heart attack and sudden cardiac death
- Stroke
- Peripheral arterial disease
- Abdominal aortic aneurysm Estimates show that smoking increases the risk for coronary heart disease by 2 to 4 times and for stroke by 2 to 4 times compared to not smoking. Even people who smoke fewer than five cigarettes a day can have early signs of cardiovascular disease.
- Secondhand smoke increases the risk for stroke by 20%−30%.
- Breathing secondhand smoke, even for a short time, can damage blood vessels and cause blood to become stickier.

These changes can increase the risk of having a heart attack. Reduced risk refers to quitting smoking in comparison to continued smoking. Research also suggests that quitting smoking may reduce the risk of: *
- Atrial fibrillation
- Sudden cardiac death
- Heart failure
- Venous thromboembolism
- Peripheral arterial disease People who already have coronary heart disease also benefit from quitting smoking. Quitting smoking can lower the risk of having another heart attack and the risk of dying from heart disease.
