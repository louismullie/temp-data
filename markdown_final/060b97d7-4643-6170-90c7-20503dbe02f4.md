## Question

What to do if patient is having heavy chest

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what to do if a patient is having "heavy chest". Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate safety and whether this could be an acute coronary syndrome or another life-threatening cause. Then, I should verify the key elements of history and physical examination that raise or lower suspicion for ACS. Next, I will review the initial diagnostic workup, including ECG and troponin timing. After that, I need to apply risk stratification and clinical decision pathways to decide on disposition. Finally, I will consider special populations, documentation language, and follow-up, ensuring I double-check any assumptions along the way.

> Let me first confirm the urgency: "heavy chest" is a classic descriptor of myocardial ischemia and should be treated as a potential acute coronary syndrome until proven otherwise, so activating EMS and getting to the ED is the priority, and I should not delay that for testing or observation in non-ED settings [^111MyB1K] [^115U6RyZ] [^112fndKs].

> Wait, let me verify the initial assessment steps once EMS is engaged: obtain a focused history of onset, location, radiation, character, precipitating and relieving factors, associated symptoms, and risk factors; perform vitals and a targeted exam for hemodynamic instability, new murmurs, pulmonary findings, or signs of alternative life threats; and get a 12-lead ECG within 10 minutes of arrival, repeating if symptoms persist or the first ECG is nondiagnostic, because early ECG interpretation drives reperfusion decisions and risk stratification [^115Wf5GB] [^114tR4dt] [^115u9pdV].

> I need to check the biomarker strategy next: high-sensitivity cardiac troponin is preferred, with serial sampling at 0 and 1–3 hours for hs-cTn or 0 and 3–6 hours for conventional assays, and in selected low-risk patients with symptoms ≥ 3 hours and a normal ECG, a single hs-cTn below the assay's limit of detection can exclude myocardial injury; I should confirm institutional CDP thresholds and integrate prior troponins if available [^114wzEjJ] [^115fEBQw] [^114r7B1D].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about etiology; I should actively consider the "Big Three" life threats — ACS, pulmonary embolism, and aortic dissection — based on history and exam, and use chest radiography broadly in the ED to uncover alternative diagnoses or complications, while not letting it delay reperfusion when STEMI is present [^112PoAtR] [^113JDTgA].

> Next, I should review risk stratification using a validated clinical decision pathway such as HEART or the ACC/AHA CDP to categorize low, intermediate, or high risk; low-risk patients have a 30-day MACE risk < 1% and can often be discharged without admission or urgent testing, whereas intermediate-risk patients warrant further diagnostic evaluation and high-risk patients should proceed to invasive coronary angiography [^116RFQAY] [^115hrVbg] [^114uP7HV].

> Let me consider disposition and testing for low-risk patients: if the CDP places the patient at low risk with a 30-day MACE < 1%, discharge without urgent cardiac testing is reasonable, with return precautions and close follow-up; I should confirm that the patient understands red flags and has access to prompt care if symptoms recur [^116RFQAY] [^115hrVbg].

> For intermediate-risk patients, I should double-check the best next test: noninvasive options include exercise ECG, stress echocardiography, myocardial perfusion imaging, or coronary CT angiography, with CCTA offering rapid rule-out of obstructive CAD and shorter time to diagnosis in appropriate candidates; shared decision-making about radiation, contrast, and downstream implications is essential [^1158u1Hw] [^114b2Tmm] [^116HmBxw].

> For high-risk patients, I need to ensure there is no delay: proceed to invasive coronary angiography and guideline-directed medical therapy for ACS, recognizing that ECG STEMI mandates immediate reperfusion and that NSTE-ACS with high-risk features similarly benefits from early invasive management [^114uP7HV] [^115cynDQ].

> But wait, what if the ECG is normal and troponins are negative — does that exclude ACS? I should confirm that unstable angina remains in the differential when symptoms are high risk or ongoing, and that serial ECGs and troponins improve sensitivity; if suspicion remains high, further testing or observation is warranted despite initially negative results [^116oj6Tr] [^115PLUvA].

> I will now examine special populations: women and patients with diabetes or older adults may present with "anginal equivalents" such as dyspnea, fatigue, or epigastric discomfort, and traditional risk tools may underestimate risk in women; I should maintain a high index of suspicion and avoid labeling symptoms as "atypical", which can delay care [^112fojFo] [^111q2MR7] [^116QNbp2].

> Let me reconsider terminology because it affects care: I should avoid calling symptoms "atypical" and instead classify them as cardiac, possible cardiac, or noncardiac; this reduces bias and ensures appropriate testing and treatment decisions are made based on risk rather than descriptors [^115dUjAM] [^115EMAzi].

> Next, I should review documentation and communication: record the exact symptom descriptors, timing, radiation, associated symptoms, risk factors, ECG findings, troponin results, CDP risk category, and the rationale for disposition; use shared decision-making for intermediate-risk patients to align testing choices with patient values and local resources [^116HmBxw] [^117Ux8De].

> Finally, I need to ensure follow-up and safety netting: provide clear return precautions, arrange timely follow-up, and consider education materials to improve understanding; in patients with recurrent, unexplained chest pain after a negative workup, consider noncardiac etiologies and, when appropriate, referral for cognitive behavioral therapy or other targeted evaluations [^114fXYkw] [^113dG3ii].

Heavy chest is most often a sign of **myocardial ischemia** [^116xMAWL] and should be treated as a potential **acute coronary syndrome** until proven otherwise [^111MyB1K]. Immediate action is to **activate EMS** [^112fndKs], obtain a **12-lead ECG within 10 minutes** [^114tR4dt], and draw high-sensitivity troponin at 0 and 1–3 hours [^114wzEjJ]. Give aspirin 162–325 mg if no allergy [^112fndKs], start nitroglycerin for ongoing pain, and initiate a beta-blocker if no contraindications. Risk-stratify using a validated pathway (HEART, EDACS, or TIMI) [^114G1CRn] to guide disposition: low-risk patients may be discharged with follow-up, intermediate-risk patients need further testing (stress imaging or CCTA) [^111sLkhK], and high-risk patients require admission and invasive evaluation [^114uP7HV]. Do not use the term "atypical" [^115dUjAM]; describe symptoms as cardiac, possible cardiac, or noncardiac [^115EMAzi].

---

## Initial assessment and immediate actions

- **Activate emergency medical services (EMS)**: Immediate transport to the nearest ED is critical [^112fndKs].

- **Initial evaluation**: Rapid history, physical exam, and 12-lead ECG within 10 minutes of arrival [^114tR4dt].

- **Biomarkers**: High-sensitivity cardiac troponin at presentation and repeat at 1–3 hours [^114wzEjJ].

- **Aspirin**: 162–325 mg chewed and swallowed if no allergy or contraindication [^112fndKs].

- **Nitroglycerin**: Sublingual every 5 minutes up to three doses for ongoing chest discomfort if systolic BP > 90 mmHg.

- **Beta-blocker**: Initiate if no contraindications (e.g. bradycardia, heart failure, asthma).

---

## Risk stratification and diagnostic pathways

Use **validated clinical decision pathways** (HEART, EDACS, TIMI) to stratify risk and guide disposition [^114G1CRn]:

| **Risk category** | **Disposition and diagnostic strategy** |
|-|-|
| Low risk (< 1% 30-day MACE) | Discharge with outpatient follow-up; no urgent cardiac testing [^116RFQAY] |
| Intermediate risk (1–5% 30-day MACE) | Observation or admission; stress testing or CCTA [^111sLkhK] |
| High risk (> 5% 30-day MACE) | Admission; invasive coronary angiography [^1144ozkh] |

---

## Further diagnostic testing

- **Stress testing**: Exercise ECG, stress echocardiography, or myocardial perfusion imaging for intermediate-risk patients [^114b2Tmm].

- **Coronary CT angiography (CCTA)**: Rapid rule-out of obstructive CAD; reduces time to diagnosis [^1158u1Hw].

- **Invasive coronary angiography**: For high-risk patients or persistent symptoms despite negative noninvasive tests [^1144ozkh].

---

## Special considerations

- **Women and elderly**: Higher likelihood of nonclassic symptoms; maintain high suspicion [^112fojFo].

- **Diabetes**: Silent ischemia is common; lower threshold for testing [^notfound].

- **Cocaine/methamphetamine use**: Increased risk of coronary vasospasm and ACS [^notfound].

---

## Documentation and communication

Document symptom quality, location, radiation, precipitating/relieving factors, and associated symptoms [^115Wf5GB]. Use **shared decision-making** for intermediate-risk patients to discuss risks, benefits, and alternatives [^116HmBxw]. Avoid the term "atypical"; use "cardiac", "possible cardiac", or "noncardiac" to reduce ambiguity [^115dUjAM].

---

## Follow-up and disposition

Low-risk patients should have **close outpatient follow-up** and clear return precautions [^116RFQAY]. Intermediate-risk patients should be observed or admitted with **arranged follow-up testing** [^111sLkhK]. High-risk patients should be admitted with **invasive evaluation and guideline-directed therapy** [^1144ozkh].

---

Heavy chest requires a **structured, time-sensitive approach**: activate EMS, obtain an ECG and troponin, give aspirin and nitroglycerin, risk-stratify, and tailor testing and disposition to risk. This strategy maximizes early detection of ACS and improves outcomes.

Chest pain — symptom characterization and terminology — should be considered acute when it is new onset or involves a change in pattern, intensity, or duration compared with previous episodes in a patient with recurrent symptoms, and should be considered stable when symptoms are chronic and associated with consistent precipitants such as exertion or emotional stress. Although the term chest pain is used in clinical practice, patients often report pressure, tightness, squeezing, heaviness, or burning, and a more appropriate term is "chest discomfort"; patients may also report a location other than the chest, including the shoulder, arm, neck, back, upper abdomen, or jaw. Features more likely to be associated with ischemia have been described as typical versus atypical; however, the latter can be confusing because it is frequently used to describe symptoms considered nonischemic as well as noncardiac, and pain — described as sharp, fleeting, related to inspiration (pleuritic) or position, or shifting locations — suggests a lower likelihood of ischemia.

Top 10 take-home messages — evaluation and diagnosis of chest pain emphasize that chest pain means more than pain in the chest; pain, pressure, tightness, or discomfort in the chest, shoulders, arms, neck, back, upper abdomen, or jaw, as well as shortness of breath and fatigue should all be considered anginal equivalents. High-sensitivity troponins are preferred for biomarker diagnosis; high-sensitivity cardiac troponins are the preferred standard for establishing a biomarker diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction, allowing for more accurate detection and exclusion of myocardial injury. Early care for acute symptoms is stressed; patients with acute chest pain or chest pain equivalent symptoms should seek medical care immediately by calling 9–1–1, and although most patients will not have a cardiac cause, the evaluation of all patients should focus on the early identification or exclusion of life-threatening causes.

Patients with acute or stable chest pain who are at intermediate risk or intermediate to high pre-test risk of obstructive coronary artery disease, respectively, will benefit the most from cardiac imaging and testing. "Noncardiac" should be used if heart disease is not suspected, whereas "Atypical" is a misleading descriptor of chest pain, and its use is discouraged. For patients presenting with acute or stable chest pain, structured risk assessment should be used and risk for coronary artery disease and adverse events should be estimated using evidence-based diagnostic protocols.

Chest pain evaluation after excluding myocardial injury — if acute myocardial injury is ruled out, alternative diagnoses merit consideration in patients with persistent or recurrent symptoms, and clinical risk assessment, with implementation of CDPs when appropriate, is the key to selecting patients for further diagnostic evaluation and also to choosing among potential diagnostic modalities.

### Streaming and redirection of lower acuity adult patients attending the ED: patient and staff experience [^114T1LrW]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

Setting

This study was based in the EDs of two NHS Hospital Trusts in the southwest and the southeast of England, selected purposively for their two different methods of streaming and redirection (traditional vs digital). The southwest site used a traditional approach with a trained ED nurse who was stationed at reception with the specific role of rapid assessment and potential redirection of patients. All patients attending the ED were first registered by an ED receptionist. Patients had a brief discussion with a senior nurse at reception and, if appropriate, were asked to see a dedicated 'redirection' nurse. Those identified by a brief initial discussion with a senior ED nurse at reception for potential redirection were sent to a dedicated 'redirection' nurse. The redirection nurse then completed an assessment based on the Manchester Triage system, including recording a set of physiological observations. Following assessment, patients were either redirected, streamed or retained in the ED for further evaluation and treatment as appropriate.

The southeast site had recently implemented the NHS urgent care self-service tool; a web-based application (digital tool) used within the ED which most patients were encouraged to use as appropriate (with the exception of patients who had already spoken to NHS111 or patients experiencing symptoms of stroke, chest pain or heavy bleeding). The urgent care self-service product digital tool was presented to patients on one of four iPads within the ED foyer and asked the same questions as are used in NHS111. A streamer nurse stood near the iPads to support patients in completing the questions. Once completed, a destination was provided (eg, minor injuries unit). The streamer nurse then reviewed the patient information and made a digital note indicating if they agreed or disagreed with the recommendation provided by the digital tool. Patients then registered with the most appropriate service, as recommended or confirmed by the streamer nurse. At the time of this study, the iPads were an extra step for patients and staff and were being trialled, with the information provided by the streamer nurse used to train the system to make more accurate recommendations.

The two departments were located in different regions of England with different numbers of patient attendance, different case mixes and service and staff configuration. One site is a Major Trauma Centre and one site is a Trauma Unit with patient volumes of > 100 000 and < 20 000 in 2023–2024, respectively.

Weak recommendation, low or very low-quality evidence (2C): Uncertainty in the estimates of benefits, risks, and burden; benefits, risk, and burden may be closely balanced; Evidence for at least one critical outcome from observational studies, case series, or from randomized controlled trials with serious flaws or indirect evidence; Other alternatives may be equally reasonable. Higher quality research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may well change the estimate.

Chest pain in women — synopsis and risk patterns indicate that most patients who present to the ED with chest pain are women, particularly among those ≥ 65 years of age. The ISCHEMIA (International Study of Comparative Health Effectiveness With Medical and Invasive Approaches) trial demonstrated that women with moderate-to-severe ischemia are more symptomatic than men, and women are less likely to have timely and appropriate care. Women may also present with accompanying symptoms more often than men, yet chest pain remains the predominant symptom among those ultimately diagnosed with ACS, occurring with a frequency equal to men. Traditional risk score tools and physician assessments often underestimate risk in women and misclassify them as having nonischemic chest pain.

Figure 8 — General approach to suspected acute coronary syndrome (ACS) using a clinical decision pathway (CDP) indicates that for an obvious noncardiac cause, no cardiac testing required (Section 4.3) (1); for an obvious nonischemic cardiac cause, other cardiac testing as needed; for possible ACS, use CDP to risk stratify (1); intermediate-risk pathways note further diagnostic testing may be indicated, and if there is a moderate-severe abnormality proceed to invasive coronary angiography (1); a high-risk branch also directs invasive coronary angiography (1).

### Information sheets for patients with acute chest pain: randomised controlled trial [^114fXYkw]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Intervention took place after diagnostic assessment was complete and the patient's management plan had been formulated. On the basis of the diagnostic information obtained, the chest pain nurses decided which of the four information sheets was most appropriate for each patient. This decision was recorded before randomisation. After randomisation, patients in both the intervention and the control groups received standard verbal advice from the chest pain nurses. After advice, patients allocated to the intervention group were given the appropriate information sheet to read and take away. The chest pain nurses answered any queries about the information but did not talk through the sheet with the patients.

We collected basic data on all enrolled patients, including sex, age, ethnic origin, and risk factors for coronary heart disease. One month after recruitment all patients were sent a questionnaire by post consisting of the hospital anxiety and depression scale, the SF-36 health related quality of life survey, a patient satisfaction survey, and a brief questionnaire asking about severity and duration of any symptoms related to chest pain, any attempts at lifestyle change (smoking cessation, dietary change, and exercise), whether the patient sought information about their symptoms from other sources, and what actions the patient would take in the event of further chest pain. Questionnaires were resent to non-responders at six and eight weeks. Once responses had been received all participants in the control group were sent a copy of the information sheet most appropriate to their discharge diagnosis.

### Time to move on: redefining chest pain outcomes [^1164MZqp]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Consider the following case scenarios:

A 65‐year‐old man with a history of hypertension and coronary artery disease presents to his cardiologist with 2 weeks of intermittent, exertional chest pressure and dyspnea. An ECG shows nonspecific findings. His HEART score is 6. The patient is scheduled for a cardiac catheterization the following week. Significant atherosclerotic disease is identified, and revascularization is performed. Most would agree that his evaluation and management were patient centered, expedient, and successful.

Now consider the same patient presentation, only this time in the ED. He has the same history, the same ECG, normal vital signs, and negative serial troponin assays. His HEART score is still 6, placing him at moderate‐risk for a MACE in the next 4–6 weeks. In our current healthcare environment, the patient would likely be admitted to the hospital or placed in an observation unit. But does this make him safer? In both scenarios, he undergoes revascularization, but in the latter, had he been discharged from the ED, his revascularization would have been deemed a missed MACE. This is a contributing factor to patients being exposed to the risks and costs inherent to hospitalization. Does the setting in which care is provided justify these additional risks and healthcare costs?

In ACS, early invasive treatment (within 24–48 hours), with cardiac catheterization and appropriate revascularization, remains the preferred treatment for patients with unstable angina or non–ST‐segment–elevation MI when prohibitive comorbidities are absent. 11 Percutaneous coronary intervention for stable angina, even with modest amounts of ischemia, has not been shown to reduce death, nonfatal MI, unplanned revascularization, or angina. 11 Without evidence‐based support for urgent revascularization in the absence of objective findings of myocardial ischemia, infarction, or unstable angina, the outcome of percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass graft surgery within the following 4–6 weeks should not be included in the ED disposition decision. However, non–ST‐segment–elevation MI identified in follow‐up and leading to revascularization could be included in the outcome measure.

### Classification of cough as a symptom in adults and management algorithms: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^115GbBJs]. Chest (2018). Medium credibility.

CHEST guideline — recommendation development used a structured consensus-based modified Delphi approach, and for a recommendation or suggestion to be approved by the Expert Cough Panel, "75% of the eligible panel members had to vote, and 80% of those voting had to strongly agree or agree with the statement". Within this framework, "a strong recommendation applies to almost all patients, whereas a weak recommendation is conditional and applies to only some patients", with strength "based on consideration of three factors: balance of benefits to harms, patient values and preferences, and resource considerations", where harms can include "convenience or lack of convenience, difficulty of administration, and invasiveness", resource considerations "go beyond economics and should also factor in time and other indirect costs", and a patient representative "provided patient-centered input".

### Typical and atypical symptoms of acute coronary syndrome: time to retire the terms? [^111q2MR7]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Studies indicate that symptoms labeled as "atypical" are more common in women evaluated for myocardial infarction (MI) and may contribute to the lower likelihood of a diagnosis and delayed treatment and result in poorer outcomes compared with men with MI. Atypical pain is frequently defined as epigastric or back pain or pain that is described as burning, stabbing, or characteristic of indigestion. Typical symptoms usually include chest, arm, or jaw pain described as dull, heavy, tight, or crushing. In a recent article published in the Journal of the American Heart Association (JAHA), Ferry and colleagues addressed presenting symptoms in men and women diagnosed with MI and reported that typical symptoms in women were more predictive of a diagnosis of MI than for men. A critical question is, are there really typical or atypical symptoms, and if so, who is the reference group? We propose that researchers and clinicians either discontinue using the terms typical and atypical or provide the reference group to which the terms apply (eg, men versus women). We believe it is past time to standardize the symptom assessment for MI so that proper and rapid diagnostic testing can be undertaken; however, we cannot standardize the symptom experience. When we do this, we are at risk of having study results, such as those of Ferry and colleagues, that vary from prior evidence and could lead to what the authors hope to avoid: disadvantaging women in receiving expeditious diagnostic testing and treatment for acute coronary syndrome.

### Four patients with a history of acute exacerbations of COPD: implementing the CHEST / Canadian Thoracic Society guidelines for preventing exacerbations [^113DXbMk]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Evaluation of the patient, risk assessment and adherence to medication

The essential first step in the management of this lady (as for any patient) includes a detailed medical evaluation. Our patient has a well-established diagnosis of COPD with severe airflow obstruction (GOLD grade 3), significant breathlessness that resulted in her retiring from her job, and recurrent exacerbations. She does not have significant co-morbidity, although this requires to be confirmed. Further to the medical evaluation, it is important to assess her actual disease management (medication and proper use) as well as making sure she has adopted a healthy lifestyle (smoking cessation, physical activities and exercise). Does she live in a smoke-free environment? Effect of and evidence for smoking cessation in the prevention of acute exacerbations of COPD is low, but evidence exists for a reduction in cough and phlegm after smoking cessation and less lung function decline upon sustained cessation. With respect to the medication, never assume that it is taken as prescribed. When asking the patient, use open questions such as 'I would like to hear how you take your medication on a typical day?' instead of 'Did you take the medication as prescribed'. Open questions tend to elicit more useful and pertinent information, and invite collaboration. Asking the patient to demonstrate her inhalation technique shows you the way she uses her different inhalation devices.

Circulation (2021). High credibility.

Chest pain characteristics and corresponding causes — symptom quality, timing, location, and modifiers: Anginal symptoms are perceived as retrosternal chest discomfort (eg, pain, discomfort, heaviness, tightness, pressure, constriction, squeezing), and sharp chest pain that increases with inspiration and lying supine is unlikely related to ischemic heart disease. Anginal symptoms gradually build in intensity over a few minutes, whereas fleeting chest pain of few seconds' duration is unlikely to be related to ischemic heart disease. Sudden onset of ripping chest pain with radiation to the upper or lower back is unlikely to be anginal and is suspicious of an acute aortic syndrome, and pain that can be localized to a very limited area or radiating to below the umbilicus or hip is unlikely related to myocardial ischemia. Ripping chest pain, "worse chest pain of my life", especially when sudden in onset and occurring in a hypertensive patient or with a known bicuspid aortic valve or aortic dilation, is suspicious of an acute aortic syndrome. Physical exercise or emotional stress are common triggers of anginal symptoms, occurrence at rest or with minimal exertion associated with anginal symptoms usually indicates ACS, and positional chest pain is usually nonischemic. Relief with nitroglycerin is not necessarily diagnostic of myocardial ischemia and should not be used as a diagnostic criterion. Common symptoms associated with myocardial ischemia include dyspnea, palpitations, diaphoresis, lightheadedness, presyncope or syncope, upper abdominal pain, or heartburn unrelated to meals and nausea or vomiting, and symptoms on the left or right side of the chest, stabbing, sharp pain, or discomfort in the throat or abdomen may occur in patients with diabetes, women, and elderly patients.

Initial evaluation — synopsis and comprehensive history elements in the emergency department (ED): Patients presenting to the ED with nontraumatic chest pain are a frequent diagnostic challenge. The priorities are rapid initiation of optimal management for life-threatening conditions such as acute coronary syndromes (ACS), aortic dissection, and pulmonary embolism (PE), as well as nonvascular syndromes (eg, esophageal rupture, tension pneumothorax), and deliberate therapy for those with less critical illness. The initial electrocardiogram (ECG) is important to the evaluation, but history, examination, biomarkers, and other aids remain essential, and there is frequently a lack of correlation between intensity of symptoms and seriousness of disease. A comprehensive history that captures chest pain characteristics — nature, onset and duration, location and radiation, precipitating factors, relieving factors, and associated symptoms — can help better identify potential cardiac causes and should be obtained from all patients.

Chest pain in adults — More than 7.8 million people are evaluated in US EDs each year for chest pain, and the prevalence of myocardial infarction in patients presenting to the ED with nontraumatic chest pain varies by age, ranging from ≈1% in patients 18 to 44 years of age to 4% in patients ≥ 80 years of age. The most important action for a person experiencing chest pain or other symptoms that might indicate a myocardial infarction is to activate EMS, and aspirin in the dose of 162 to 324 mg improves survival in patients with myocardial infarction. The AHA does not recommend administration of oxygen in health care settings for people with acute coronary syndromes who are not hypoxic.

Patients who present to the ED with chest pain (or its equivalent) but have no electrocardiographic changes or elevation in cardiac biomarkers after an appropriate interval can be considered low risk for acute coronary syndrome. Combined with a low demographic risk for coronary artery disease (eg, using Framingham criteria), such patients can be said to be "low risk" for a subsequent coronary event. Whether there is a role for further risk stratification with provocative testing and/or coronary imaging before discharge remains open to debate.

### Patient information: community-acquired pneumonia… [^1173MLCC]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Dao TH, Jackson CD. What Is Community-Acquired Pneumonia. JAMA. 2025; 333:

442. doi: 10.1001/jama.2024.22251 Community-acquired pneumonia is a lung infection that is contracted outside of a hospital. In the US, CAP results in about 1. 4 million emergency department visits, 740 000 hospitalizations, and 41 108 deaths each year. Mortality after hospitalization for CAP is 2. 8% for adults younger than 60 years and
26. 8% for those aged 60 years or older who have multiple medical conditions.

1. Risk factors for CAP include older age, cigarette smoking, chronic lung diseases such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and other chronic conditions, such as HIV, cancer, diabetes, and heavy alcohol use. CAP can be caused by a variety of organisms, including bacteria, viruses, and fungi, although the pathogen is often not identified. Among hospitalized patients with CAP, the most common causes are viruses and the bacterium Streptococcus pneumoniae.

Symptoms of CAP may include fever, chills, cough with or without sputum, shortness of breath, chest pain, confusion, and fatigue. Patients are diagnosed with CAP if they have signs and symptoms of CAP and chest imaging findings consistent with pneumonia. All patients with suspected CAP should have chest imaging. Chest x-ray is often the initial type of imaging, and if it does not reveal CAP, chest computed tomography should be considered. All patients with CAP should be tested for influenza and COVID-19 if these viruses are circulating in the community. Additional testing of sputum and blood cultures should be performed only in patients with severe CAP or those with risk factors for resistant bacteria.

For outpatients, suspected bacterial CAP is typically treated with a 3-day course of oral antibiotics or combination oral antibiotics for those with multiple medical conditions. Hospitalized patients with suspected bacterial CAP should receive intravenous antibiotics for at least 3 days. Hospitalized patients with severe CAP should also receive steroids. Patients with severe CAP should be closely monitored and treated in an intensive care unit. Those who develop respiratory failure may need mechanical ventilation. Medications to increase blood pressure should be used for patients with CAP who develop shock.

Suspected acute coronary syndrome (ACS) risk stratification — patients with acute chest pain receive history + physical examination and ECG, then branch by initial impression. For an obvious noncardiac cause, No cardiac testing required (Section 4.3) (1). For an obvious nonischemic cardiac cause, Other cardiac testing as needed. If Possible ACS, Obtain troponin (1) and Use CDP to risk stratify (1). Risk groups direct actions as follows: Low risk — No testing required (1) and Discharge; Intermediate risk — Further diagnostic testing may be indicated; High risk — Invasive coronary angiography (1).

General approach to risk stratification of suspected acute coronary syndrome (ACS) — when a noncardiac cause is obvious, "No cardiac testing required (Section 4.3) (1)". For an "Obvious nonischemic cardiac cause", perform "Other cardiac testing as needed". If ACS is being considered, actions include "Obtain troponin (1)" and "Use CDP to risk stratify (1)" (ACS indicates acute coronary syndrome; CDP, clinical decision pathway; and ECG, electrocardiogram). Subsequent pathways include "No testing required (1)" or "Further diagnostic testing may be indicated", with "Moderate-severe abnormality" leading to "Invasive coronary angiography (1)".

### Management of acute coronary syndrome [^115cynDQ]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

One of the most common complaints encountered in the emergency department is chest pain. In many evaluations, the leading diagnostic consideration is an acute coronary syndrome (ACS). ACS refers to a spectrum of coronary artery pathologies, including unstable angina, non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction, and ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. The distinction between subtypes of ACS guides acute diagnostic and management decisions. Failure to diagnose and manage ACS properly is a frequent cause of medico-legal litigation. In this article, we review the initial identification and critical management steps in patients presenting to the emergency department with ACS.

CHEST grading system — strong recommendations (1A–1C) define benefit–risk balance, evidence quality, and implications as follows: Strong recommendation, high-quality evidence (1A) has "Benefits clearly outweigh risk and burdens, or vice versa", is supported by "Consistent evidence from randomized controlled trials without important limitations, or exceptionally strong evidence from observational studies", and implies "Recommendation can apply to most patients in most circumstances. Further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect". Strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence (1B) uses the same benefit–risk balance, with "Evidence from randomized, controlled trials with important limitations (inconsistent results, methodologic flaws, indirect or imprecise), or very strong evidence from observational studies", and the implication "Recommendation can apply to most patients in most circumstances. Higher quality research may well have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate". Strong recommendation, low or very low-quality evidence (1C) retains the same benefit–risk balance, with "Evidence for at least one critical outcome from observational studies, case series, or from randomized, controlled trials with serious flaws or indirect evidence", and the implication "Recommendation can apply to most patients in many circumstances.

### Typical and atypical symptoms of acute coronary syndrome: time to retire the terms? [^116QNbp2]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Symptoms are the trigger that propel individuals with symptoms suspicious of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) to seek emergent care for this potentially life‐threatening condition. After 3 decades of research on sex differences in the symptoms of ACS, ample evidence suggests that although sex differences in symptoms exist, they are modest and do not contribute significantly to risk stratification or provide a rationale for diagnostic testing based on sex. In a large prospective study, we found that only 3 of 13 common symptoms were predictive of a diagnosis of ACS versus non‐ACS. The predictive value of shoulder pain (odds ratio: 2.53 [95% CI, 1.29–4.96] versus 1.11 [95% CI, 0.67–1.85]) and arm pain (odds ratio: 2.15 [95% CI, 1.10–4.20] versus 1.21 [95% CI, 0.74–1.99]) for women were nearly twice that of men. Shortness of breath was predictive of a non‐ACS diagnosis for men only. 1

Scores of authors have found some sex differences in symptoms of ACS, 2, 3 but small differences were usually based on frequency and distribution of symptoms, not the type of symptom. In many studies, statistical significance was reached when sex differences were as small as a few percentage points. Kahn et al 4 found, for example, that men reported chest pain more frequently than women (86.3% versus 81%; P = 0.03). We must distinguish between clinical significance (whether the magnitude of difference is large enough to change clinical care) and statistical significance (which is subject to variability in sampling and measurement) in assessing patients for further intervention. A more critical issue than sex differences in symptoms is likely the magnitude of symptom overlap in individuals ruled in and out for ACS. Approximately 10% to 15% of patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with symptoms suggestive of ACS are actually experiencing ACS, 5, 6 yet the other 85% of patients look so similar that the same diagnostic testing and resources are required to safely rule them out for ACS. Numerous clinical‐decision aids to assess risk for ACS in the ED have been validated over the years, some with 100% sensitivity. 5 Many of these clinical‐decision or prediction rules have facilitated transfer of low‐risk patients to a chest‐pain or clinical‐decision unit or early discharge from the ED. 7

Noninvasive cardiovascular diagnostic testing — objectives and target population are defined: the primary role of subsequent testing is for evaluation of patients classified as intermediate risk according to the initial CDP evaluation; low-risk patients have a very low event rate and can usually be discharged without in-hospital testing, whereas high-risk patients should usually be admitted and initiated on guideline-based therapies if type 1 MI is considered; goals are accurate diagnosis or exclusion of clinically significant CAD or other cardiovascular conditions, risk-stratification to determine which patients require immediate treatment versus those for whom it can be delayed or deferred, and identification of abnormalities such as nonobstructive coronary atherosclerosis or left ventricular hypertrophy requiring follow-up, underscoring the importance of consistent post-test reporting.

Emergency department ECG assessment summary — The ECG is a critical component of the initial assessment and management of ED patients with possible ACS. The ECG should be rapidly assessed for evidence of acute infarction or ischemia, and if present, subsequent care should follow current guidelines for management of acute STEMI and NSTE-ACS. The ECG should also be examined for subtle changes that are also consistent with ACS as well as for other findings that could suggest a non-ACS cause for their symptoms, and patients who have a non-ischemic ECG (as defined previously) are eligible for entering a CDP, and further clinical evaluation should take place as outlined later.

Dyspnea in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) — Dyspnea is a cardinal symptom of COPD and a major cause of the disability and anxiety associated with the disease, and it comprises a sensory and an affective component. Typically, COPD patients describe dyspnea as a sense of increased effort to breathe, chest heaviness, air hunger, or gasping, and it is highly prevalent across all stages of airflow obstruction and occurs particularly during exertion or physical activity, with moderate-to-severe dyspnea reported by > 40% of patients diagnosed with COPD in primary care. Dyspnea is complex with mechanisms including impaired respiratory mechanics as a consequence of airflow obstruction and lung hyperinflation, gas exchange abnormalities, peripheral muscle dysfunction related to deconditioning (and systemic inflammation in some patients), psychological distress, dysfunctional breathing, cardiovascular or other comorbid diseases. Dyspnea measured by the 5-level modified Medical Research Council scale is integrated in the GOLD clinical classification scheme because patients with high dyspnea scores incur higher healthcare resource utilization and costs, and dyspnea in daily life can be measured by a number of detailed questionnaires that are more discriminant and sensitive to change.

Angina pectoris — recommendation-specific supportive text — notes that angina pectoris is perceived as a retrosternal chest discomfort that builds gradually in intensity (over several minutes), is usually precipitated by stress (physical or emotional) or occurring at rest (as in the case of an ACS) with characteristic radiation (eg, left arm, neck, jaw) and its associated symptoms (eg, dyspnea, nausea, lightheadedness). When actively treated or spontaneously resolving, it dissipates over a few minutes. Relief with nitroglycerin is not necessarily diagnostic of myocardial ischemia and should not be used as a diagnostic criterion, and associated symptoms such as shortness of breath, nausea or vomiting, lightheadedness, confusion, presyncope or syncope, or vague abdominal symptoms are more common among patients with diabetes, women, and the elderly. A detailed assessment of cardiovascular risk factors, review of systems, past medical history, and family and social history should complement the assessment of presenting symptoms.

Chest pain symptom characterization and terminology — For myocardial ischemia, the sensation is described as "characteristically deep, difficult to localize, and usually diffuse", and "Point tenderness renders ischemia less likely". "It is essential to ascertain the characteristics of the chest pain directly from the patient for optimal interpretation.17" Although "A patient's history is the most important basis for considering presence or absence of myocardial ischemia", "The diagnosis of ischemia may require data beyond history alone", and "In some patients, what appears to be noncardiac chest pain may be ischemic in origin". Features more consistent with ischemia are summarized as "Chest pain that is more likely associated with ischemia consists of substernal chest discomfort provoked by exertion or emotional stress and relieved by rest or nitroglycerin". Terminology guidance states "Atypical chest pain is a problematic term" and "we discourage the use of atypical chest pain"; to reduce ambiguity, "To diminish ambiguity, use "cardiac", "possible cardiac", and "noncardiac" to describe the suspected cause of chest pain is encouraged", and "chest pain is broadly defined to also include referred pain in the shoulders, arms, jaw, neck, and upper abdomen".

### Chest pain evaluation: updated guidelines from the AHA / ACC… [^1158u1Hw]. AAFP (2023). Medium credibility.

Patients commonly describe ischemic chest pain as pressure, squeezing, heaviness, tightness, exertional, stress-related, or retrosternal. Pain that is sharp, fleeting, pleuritic, positional, or shifting locations is less likely to be of cardiac origin. These guidelines suggest describing chest pain as cardiac; possible cardiac; or noncardiac. The descriptor atypical is no longer used because it can be interpreted by patients as being benign. Physical examination can sometimes demonstrate life-threatening causes of chest pain, including diaphoresis and tachypnea suggesting ACS, tachycardia and dyspnea suggesting pulmonary embolism, and subcutaneous emphysema suggesting esophageal rupture. Chest tenderness on palpation or pain with inspiration suggests a noncardiac etiology. Exercise can be used for any patient who is not frail and can achieve at least five metabolic equivalents, which is required to do many activities of daily living.

Patients who cannot meet both requirements should receive pharmacologic stress testing. Exercise ECG testing should be avoided in patients with ECG findings of 0. 5-mm ST depression, left ventricular hypertrophy, paced rhythm, left bundle branch block, Wolff-Parkinson-White pattern, or digitalis use. For patients without known CAD at intermediate risk, CCTA is recommended with a negative or inconclusive ACS workup and for patients with a mildly abnormal stress test within the past year. CCTA allows for rapid diagnosis and discharge with similar outcomes as stress testing. CCTA decreases time to diagnosis by 50% compared with nuclear stress testing. Negative stress testing rules out the need for anatomic testing. Exercise ECG testing and stress echocardiography are most likely to reduce length of stay. Intermediate-risk patients with known CAD and acute chest pain should have blood pressure and cholesterol management maximized before additional testing.

CCTA can document CAD progression in patients with previous testing demonstrating nonobstructive lesions. Patients with a history of high-risk CAD or worsening frequency of symptoms who have optimized blood pressure and cholesterol management should be evaluated with invasive coronary angiography. High-risk patients with acute chest pain should receive invasive coronary angiography. Nonischemic Chest Pain Immediate echocardiography should be used in patients with suspected nonischemic causes of chest pain such as aortic dissection, pericardial effusion, and pulmonary embolism. If echocardiography rules out life-threatening injury, computed tomography or cardiovascular MRI can be used to confirm a suspected diagnosis.

Stable chest pain in patients with no known coronary artery disease (CAD) — stable chest pain is a symptom of myocardial ischemia characterized by chest pain that is provoked with stress, and risk status in suspected stable ischemic heart disease is not well defined. In symptomatic patients with suspected CAD, use of validated scores to predict the pretest probability of obstructive CAD may be useful to identify low-risk patients for whom testing may be deferred, and it is preferable to use contemporary estimates from the past 10 years in preference to historic series, which may overestimate the frequency of obstructive CAD. Alternatively, low-risk patients may be those < 40 years of age or who have symptoms with a low likelihood of representing ischemia, and when available, information on the presence and amount of coronary artery calcium may be useful for enhancing the pretest probability of obstructive CAD.

### Pitfalls in evaluating the low-risk chest pain patient [^115PLUvA]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

Risk stratification and management of the patient with low-risk chest pain continues to be challenging despite the considerable effort of numerous investigators. Evidence exists that a specific subset of young patients can be defined as low risk in whom further testing may not be necessary. A high index of suspicion of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and an understanding of the many, subtle, and atypical presentations of ischemic heart disease are required. The initial history, electrocardiogram (ECG), and biomarkers are important, but serial ECGs and biomarkers improve sensitivity in detecting ACS. Unless chest pain is clearly explained, objective testing, such as exercise treadmill testing, nuclear scintigraphy, stress echocardiography, or coronary computed tomography angiogram, should be considered before, or soon after, discharge.

### Four patients with a history of acute exacerbations of COPD: implementing the CHEST / Canadian Thoracic Society guidelines for preventing exacerbations [^1146CtYK]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The American College of Chest Physicians and Canadian Thoracic Society have jointly produced evidence-based guidelines for the prevention of exacerbations in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This educational article gives four perspectives on how these guidelines apply to the practical management of people with COPD. A current smoker with frequent exacerbations will benefit from support to quit, and from optimisation of his inhaled treatment. For a man with very severe COPD and multiple co-morbidities living in a remote community, tele-health care may enable provision of multidisciplinary care. A woman who is admitted for the third time in a year needs a structured assessment of her care with a view to stepping up pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment as required. The overlap between asthma and COPD challenges both diagnostic and management strategies for a lady smoker with a history of asthma since childhood. Common threads in all these cases are the importance of advising on smoking cessation, offering (and encouraging people to attend) pulmonary rehabilitation, and the importance of self-management, including an action plan supported by multidisciplinary teams.

3 RESULTS

Table 2 shows the distribution of patients based on the characteristics of the pain. The pain was non‐anginal in 37% of cases (43% of women, 30% of men), atypical in 52% of cases, and typical in 11% of cases. No functional or anatomical tests were performed in patients with non‐anginal pain, and no cardiovascular events occurred in 1 year of follow‐up in this group. In all 372 patients with typical chest pain, coronary angiography was performed, and revascularization was performed in 82% of cases. In 1706 patients with atypical chest pain, the PPT was calculated, and functional or anatomical tests were performed for the detection of possible ischemia. The test was positive in 6% of patients with PPT 15% to 65% and in 20% of those with PPT 66% to 85% (altogether in 170 patients, 10%) (Table 3). These patients underwent coronary angiography. Sixteen patients with atypical but recurrent chest pain and negative functional tests also underwent coronary angiography. In 14 patients, it was negative, and in two patients, non‐obstructive coronary heart disease was identified. Table 4 shows the main basal characteristics of the 1636 patients with negative functional or anatomical testing, stratified for at least one risky lifestyle factor. A total of 27% of patients had non‐risky lifestyles, while 73% had one or more risky lifestyles factors. At the 1‐year follow‐up, 1% (9 males, 6 females) of the patients had experienced a coronary event (four sudden deaths, three non‐fatal ST elevation myocardial infarctions (STEMIs) and eight non‐fatal non ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMIs)) (Table 4). These events were present in 0.8% of the 764 patients with PPT 15 to 65, 2.2% of the 354 patients with PPT 66 to 85 and at least one risky lifestyle factor (overall 1.2%) and one (0.2%) of the 418 patients with PPT 15 to 85 without risky lifestyle factors (P < .01). Of the 15 patients with coronary events, 11 (73%) were smokers. The four patients who experienced sudden death (0.3%) were all heavy smokers (> 20 cigarettes/day). None of the patients with cardiovascular events had changed their lifestyles during the follow‐up. Coronary events occurred at a median time of 5 months from the baseline evaluation (Table 5).

2021 Chest Pain Guideline — symptom characterization and terminology states that the sensation produced by myocardial ischemia is characteristically deep, difficult to localize, and usually diffuse, and that point tenderness renders ischemia less likely. It is essential to ascertain the characteristics of the chest pain directly from the patient for optimal interpretation, and the diagnosis of ischemia may require data beyond history alone, with some patients having noncardiac chest pain that may be ischemic in origin. Chest pain more likely associated with ischemia consists of substernal chest discomfort provoked by exertion or emotional stress and relieved by rest or nitroglycerin, and the more classic the chest discomfort is based on quality, location, radiation, and provoking and relieving factors, the more likely it is to be of cardiac ischemic origin. Atypical chest pain is a problematic term, and, as stated, we discourage the use of atypical chest pain; to diminish ambiguity, use "cardiac", "possible cardiac", and "noncardiac" to describe the suspected cause of chest pain is encouraged, and chest pain is broadly defined to also include referred pain in the shoulders, arms, jaw, neck, and upper abdomen.

Circulation (2021). High credibility.

2021 AHA/ACC Chest Pain Guideline — Setting considerations for initial ECG and transport: Unless a noncardiac cause is evident, an ECG should be performed for patients seen in the office setting with stable chest pain; if an ECG is unavailable the patient should be referred to the ED so one can be obtained. Patients with clinical evidence of ACS or other life-threatening causes of acute chest pain seen in the office setting should be transported urgently to the ED, ideally by EMS. In all patients who present with acute chest pain regardless of the setting, an ECG should be acquired and reviewed for ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) within 10 minutes of arrival.

Circulation (2021). High credibility.

Acute chest pain and suspected acute coronary syndrome (ACS) — troponin sampling, prior testing, and single-sample rule-out: In patients for whom serial troponins are indicated to exclude myocardial injury, repeat measurements after the initial sample are 1 to 3 hours for high-sensitivity troponin and 3 to 6 hours for conventional troponin assays. Institutions should implement a clinical decision pathway (CDP) with a protocol for troponin sampling based on their particular assay, and previous testing when available should be considered and incorporated into CDPs. For patients with a normal ECG and symptoms suggestive of ACS that began at least 3 hours before ED arrival, a single hs-cTn concentration that is below the limit of detection on initial measurement (time zero) is reasonable to exclude myocardial injury.

### Typical and atypical symptoms of acute coronary syndrome: time to retire the terms? [^111m62Hu]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

It is vitally important to remember that symptoms are cues for patients that a problem exists. Symptoms trigger clinicians to obtain ECGs, which drive subsequent clinical decision‐making such as activation of the cardiac catheterization laboratory for emergent percutaneous coronary intervention. 15 Nearly all patients presenting to the ED are undifferentiated. Neither the patient nor the clinician knows what the diagnosis is until testing is complete. Many emergency medical systems now have the capacity to do prehospital ECGs, Nevertheless, we found in our recent study that only 44.6% of patients with ACS arrived at the ED via emergency medical systems. In addition, a minority of patients (24.6%) experienced STEMI, and only 56.3% of patients with STEMI called emergency medical systems. This leaves a large number of patients presenting to the ED without a diagnosis. 13 In addition, individuals presenting to emergency medical systems with chest pain are significantly more likely to receive prehospital ECG compared with those who have nonchest symptoms. Consequently, despite greater availability of prehospital ECG equipment, if the patient does not report chest pain, then they are disadvantaged from even receiving a prehospital ECG. 16 Including patients with STEMI is vital to determining true differences or similarities in symptoms between female and male patients, particularly because STEMI is a true emergency requiring time‐dependent reperfusion therapy.

In the Clinical Perspective section of their article, Ferry et al 8 state that women with MI are at risk of underdiagnosis and undertreatment if "correct" symptom presentations are not recognized. Researchers, including our team, have spent years attempting to identify sex differences in the symptoms of ACS to provide evidence for clinicians to facilitate expeditious diagnosis and for the public to be able to respond quickly to symptoms. To suggest that there is a "correct" presentation implies there is an "incorrect" symptom presentation, which is not supported by numerous previous studies. 1, 17, 18 Assuming a correct presentation can also imply that there is a "standard" symptom presentation, also unsupported by the data to date. The critical question is, are there really typical or atypical symptoms, and if so, who is the reference group? We propose that researchers and clinicians either discontinue using the terms typical and atypical or provide the reference group to which the terms apply (eg, men versus women).

Many researchers have reported that upper back pain and fatigue are commonly reported symptoms during ACS, and up to 30% of patients do not experience chest pain. 19, 20 This information is important to consider as we try to differentiate patients who will be ruled in compared with those ruled out for ACS. We found that although chest pain is a sensitive symptom for ACS, it is not very specific (Table). 1 In fact, few other symptoms were sensitive or specific for a diagnosis of ACS. In our multicenter prospective study, we found few symptom differences between patients with and without ACS presenting to the ED. 13 Ferry et al 8 defined chest pain as all descriptors of chest symptoms, including pressure or discomfort. Their rationale was that terms other than pain are "functions of sex‐related language rather than symptom differences in symptom presentation". This is an opinion that is counterproductive to science and accurate assessment of symptoms, which are, by definition, subjective and what the patient says they are.

Table 1
Sensitivity and Specificity of Symptoms for ACS by Sex 1

We believe it is past time to standardize the symptom assessment so that proper and rapid diagnostic testing can be undertaken; however, we cannot standardize the symptom experience. When we do this, we are at risk of having study results such as those of Ferry et al, 8 that vary from prior evidence and could lead to what the authors hope to avoid: disadvantaging women in receiving expeditious diagnostic testing and treatment for ACS.

There is evidence to support their addition to acetaminophen, an NSAID, or a combination of acetaminophen plus NSAID, and there is no evidence to support the superiority of one weak opioid over another provided therapeutic doses are administered. There is insufficient evidence to make any recommendation concerning tramadol.

### 2021 AHA / ACC / ASE / CHEST / SAEM / SCCT / SCMR guideline for the evaluation and diagnosis of chest pain: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^115JPCFA]. Journal of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography (2021). High credibility.

2021 chest pain guideline contents — clinical scope includes initial evaluation and physical examination; diagnostic testing covering electrocardiogram (ECG), chest radiography, and biomarkers; cardiac testing modalities including coronary computed tomography angiography, invasive coronary angiography, exercise ECG, echocardiography/stress echocardiography, stress nuclear (PET or SPECT) myocardial perfusion imaging, and cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging; and patient-centric algorithms outlining pathways for patients with acute chest pain and suspected ACS with risk strata of low-risk, intermediate-risk, and high-risk, as well as special contexts such as prior coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, dialysis, cocaine and methamphetamine use, and shared decision-making; additional sections address evaluation of acute chest pain with nonischemic cardiac pathologies such as acute aortic syndrome, suspected PE, suspected myopericarditis, and valvular heart disease, suspected noncardiac causes including gastrointestinal syndromes and suspected anxiety and other psychosomatic considerations, and acute chest pain in patients with sickle cell disease; the guideline also covers evaluation of patients with stable chest pain, including those with no known coronary artery disease (CAD) with pretest risk probability to guide need for stress and anatomic tests, and patients with known CAD.

### Methodologies for the development of CHEST guidelines and expert panel reports [^113QoPtW]. Chest (2014). Medium credibility.

CHEST methodology — selection and prioritization criteria for guideline topics and updates state that the criteria in this table are used to select and prioritize topics for development or revisions, and in the LGM, approval of topics for de novo development and prioritization of guideline updates requires meeting most of the criteria in Table 1. Criteria include changes in the relevance of a clinical question to the practice of medicine, changes in available interventions (eg, new drugs or devices), changes in evidence on the existing benefits and harms of interventions, changes in outcomes considered important, changes in values placed on outcomes, changes in evidence that current practice is optimal, changes in resources available for health care, and changes of strategic importance to CHEST; the narrow scope with specific key clinical questions broken down into PICO elements permits readers to quickly understand the clinical content areas, patient populations, and interventions addressed.

### Noninvasive cardiac testing [^114b2Tmm]. American Family Physician (2024). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for chest pain, more specifically with respect to evaluation of stable chest pain, intermediate-high risk, AAFP 2024 guidelines recommend to obtain stress testing with echocardiography, myocardial perfusion imaging, or cardiac MRI, or exercise stress testing with ECG in patients with an intermediate risk of coronary artery disease and stable chest discomfort.

### Questions and answers on workup diagnosis and risk stratification: a companion document of the 2020 ESC guidelines for the management of acute coronary syndromes in patients presenting without persistent ST-segment elevation [^115cZfsX]. European Heart Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Q29. A 55-year-old woman presents with shortness of breath, a tight feeling on the chest, and palpitations for 3 h. In addition, she mentions a few episodes of intermittent chest discomfort over the last 6 months, lasting minutes but sometimes hours, occurring both at rest and during exercise. She has a positive family history for CAD. The initial ECG demonstrated atrial fibrillation with a heart rate of 130 bpm and then 96 bpm with no ischaemic changes after 30 minutes of a resting period. Initial and 1 h hs-cTn measures were 30 ng/L and 36 ng/L (ULN 14 ng/L), respectively. A resident asks you, as supervisor of the emergency department/CPU, whether CCTA should be performed now to rule-out obstructive coronary artery disease.

CCTA has a high diagnostic accuracy for ruling out occlusive CAD. However, image quality and interpretability may be hampered when irregular heart rhythm is present. Although elevated levels of hs-cTn may be attributable to myocardial injury due to rapid ventricular rate response, a CCTA is recommended because of the chest discomfort during the last 6 months and the positive family history for CAD.

Q30. A just-appointed radiologist challenges the work-up of patients with acute chest pain by stating the following: 'Why bother with clinical evaluation, repeated cTn testing, and ECG assessments in patients with suspected NSTE-ACS? In the end, all need CCTA'. Is this statement correct?

Not at all. Broad adoption of non-invasive anatomic testing, in terms of CCTA, among inadequately risk stratified patients, has been shown to increase downstream testing and costs without clinical benefit for the patient. In addition, despite the reduction in radiation doses achieved in recent years, acquisition of high-quality images with low radiation exposure, as well as appropriate interpretation of CT images, is not usually available on a 24/7 basis at every institution.

Journal of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography (2021). High credibility.

Chest pain characteristics and corresponding causes (Table 3) note that anginal symptoms are perceived as retrosternal chest discomfort and typically build in intensity over a few minutes. Sharp chest pain that increases with inspiration and lying supine is unlikely related to ischemic heart disease, and fleeting chest pain — of few seconds' duration — is unlikely to be related to ischemic heart disease. Sudden onset of ripping chest pain (with radiation to the upper or lower back) is unlikely to be angina and is suspicious of an acute aortic syndrome. Pain that can be localized to a very limited area or that radiates to below the umbilicus or hip is unlikely related to myocardial ischemia. Occurrence at rest or with minimal exertion associated with anginal symptoms usually indicates ACS, whereas positional chest pain is usually nonischemic. Relief with nitroglycerin is not necessarily diagnostic of myocardial ischemia and should not be used as a diagnostic criterion. Common symptoms associated with myocardial ischemia include dyspnea, palpitations, diaphoresis, lightheadedness, presyncope or syncope, upper abdominal pain, heartburn unrelated to meals, and nausea or vomiting; symptoms on the left or right side of the chest, stabbing or sharp pain, or throat/abdominal discomfort may occur in patients with diabetes, women, and elderly patients.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® acute nonspecific chest pain-low probability of coronary artery disease [^117KRpL3]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

This document outlines the usefulness of available diagnostic imaging for patients without known coronary artery disease and at low probability for having coronary artery disease who do not present with classic signs, symptoms, or electrocardiographic abnormalities indicating acute coronary syndrome but rather with nonspecific chest pain leading to a differential diagnosis, including pulmonary, gastrointestinal, or musculoskeletal pathologies. A number of imaging modalities are available to evaluate the broad spectrum of possible pathologies in these patients, such as chest radiography, multidetector CT, MRI, ventilation-perfusion scans, cardiac perfusion scintigraphy, transesophageal and transthoracic echocardiography, PET, spine and rib radiography, barium esophageal and upper gastrointestinal studies, and abdominal ultrasound. It is considered appropriate to start the assessment of these patients with a low-cost, low-risk diagnostic test such as a chest x-ray. Contrast-enhanced gated cardiac and ungated thoracic multidetector CT as well as transthoracic echocardiography are also usually considered as appropriate in the evaluation of these patients as a second step if necessary. A number of rest and stress single-photon emission CT myocardial perfusion imaging, ventilation-perfusion scanning, aortic and chest MR angiographic, and more specific x-ray and abdominal examinations may be appropriate as a third layer of testing, whereas MRI of the heart or coronary arteries and invasive testing such as transesophageal echocardiography or selective coronary angiography are not considered appropriate in these patients. Given the low risk of these patients, it is mandated to minimize radiation exposure as much as possible using advanced and appropriate testing protocols. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria® are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed every 2 years by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and review include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and the application of a well established consensus methodology (modified Delphi) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures by the panel. In those instances in which evidence is lacking or not definitive, expert opinion may be used to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Fourth universal definition of myocardial infarction (2018) [^116oj6Tr]. European Heart Journal (2019). High credibility.

Clinical presentations of myocardial infarction — onset of myocardial ischemia is the initial step in MI and can be identified from the patient's history and the electrocardiogram (ECG); symptoms may include chest, upper extremity, mandibular, or epigastric discomfort, dyspnea, or fatigue, but they are not specific and MI may be atypical or silent. Very brief ischemia can cause cardiac troponin release and elevations, and the involved myocytes can subsequently die due to apoptosis. If myocardial ischemia is present clinically or detected by ECG changes together with myocardial injury manifested by a rising and/or falling cTn pattern, a diagnosis of acute MI is appropriate; if ischemia is not present clinically, elevated cTn may indicate acute myocardial injury (with rising and/or falling values) or more chronic ongoing injury (if unchanging). In suspected acute coronary syndrome ruled out for MI with normal cardiac biomarkers (≤ 99th percentile URL), unstable angina or an alternative diagnosis may be present, and these patients should be evaluated and treated accordingly.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2021). High credibility.

Chest pain — emergency department and office setting considerations: In all patients presenting to the ED with acute chest pain and suspected acute coronary syndrome (ACS), cardiac troponin (cTn) should be measured as soon as possible after presentation (COR 1, LOE C-LD). For patients with acute chest pain and suspected ACS initially evaluated in the office setting, delayed transfer to the ED for cTn or other diagnostic testing should be avoided (COR 3: Harm, LOE C-LD).

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2021). High credibility.

Electrocardiogram in patients with chest pain: When the initial electrocardiogram (ECG) is nondiagnostic, serial ECGs to detect potential ischemic changes should be performed, especially when clinical suspicion of ACS is high, symptoms persist, or the clinical condition deteriorates (COR 1, LOE C-EO). Patients with chest pain whose initial ECG is consistent with an ACS should be treated according to STEMI and non–ST–segment–elevation ACS guidelines (COR 1, LOE C-EO). In patients with intermediate- to high clinical suspicion for ACS and a nondiagnostic initial ECG, supplemental electrocardiographic leads V7 to V9 are reasonable to rule out posterior myocardial infarction (MI) (COR 2a, LOE B-NR).

GRACE-1 — single high-sensitivity troponin strategy for recurrent, low-risk chest pain: In adult patients with recurrent, low-risk chest pain, for > 3 h duration we suggest a single, high-sensitivity troponin below a validated threshold to reasonably exclude ACS within 30 days. This recommendation is labeled (Conditional, For) [Low level of evidence].

Regarding diagnostic investigations for chest pain, more specifically with respect to evaluation for ACS (general principles), ACC/ACCP/AHA/ASE/SAEM/SCCT/SCMR 2021 guidelines recommend to consider excluding myocardial injury in patients with acute chest pain, a normal ECG and symptoms suggestive of ACS began at least 3 hours before emergency department arrival, and having a single high-sensitivity cardiac troponin concentration below the limit of detection on initial measurement (time zero).

### Exploring patient experience of chest pain before and after implementation of an early rule-out pathway for myocardial infarction: a Qualitative study [^111bJUrK]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

The standard assessment procedures carried out by hospital staff could be interpreted by patients in a manner different from that intended. The efficiency and speed with which ED staff carried out initial assessment procedures were interpreted by some participants as confirmation that their symptoms were a cause for concern. Likewise, the routine nature of repeated blood sampling for peak troponin level as required by the preimplementation pathway could also be interpreted by participants to signify a higher likelihood that their symptoms may have been due to myocardial infarction. Additionally, some participants spoke in terms of being part of a "process". For some participants, the routine nature of the assessment process was evidence that clinicians would perform appropriate actions because they were following a protocol. For others, the protocol-driven actions were interpreted as lack of personalized care.

Expressions of negativity concerning ambiguity in regard to an overnight admission to the hospital and the need to repeat a symptom history to multiple practitioners were common in interviews of participants assessed before implementation of the early rule-out pathway (78%; 18/23) but less so in those assessed after its implementation (15%; 4/26). These interpretations are illustrated through participant quotes in Table 3.
