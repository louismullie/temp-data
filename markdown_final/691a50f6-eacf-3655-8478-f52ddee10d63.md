## Question

Sublingual nitro dosing

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about sublingual nitroglycerin dosing, including indications, standard dosing, spray versus tablet nuances, special populations, contraindications, and a practical decision algorithm. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the indication and mechanism to anchor dosing. Then, I should verify the standard adult dosing regimen and timing. Next, I will compare tablet and spray formulations and reconcile any discrepancies. After that, I need to check special populations and absolute contraindications. Finally, I will synthesize a practical decision framework and summarize key counseling points with supporting references.

> Let me first confirm the indication and mechanism, because dosing must align with the clinical goal. Sublingual nitroglycerin is indicated for acute relief of angina pectoris due to coronary artery disease and for acute prophylaxis before activities that precipitate angina; it is not for chronic maintenance therapy, which relies on long-acting nitrates with nitrate-free intervals to avoid tolerance [^13ad46cf] [^663fbe1e]. Mechanistically, nitroglycerin generates nitric oxide, relaxes vascular smooth muscle, reduces preload and afterload, and dilates epicardial coronaries, which underpins its rapid antianginal effect and informs hemodynamic precautions during dosing [^b17b4ea9].

> I need to verify the standard adult dosing regimen and timing. The canonical approach is 0.3–0.4 mg sublingually at the first sign of chest pain, repeated every 5 minutes as needed, up to a maximum of 3 doses in 15 minutes; if pain persists after 3 doses or is atypical, seek emergency care, and for prophylaxis, take 5–10 minutes before exertion [^28ea59bc] [^1f3358b2] [^3b2b6430]. Wait, let me verify onset and duration to match counseling: onset is about 1–3 minutes with peak effect by 5 minutes and effects lasting at least 25 minutes, which supports the 5-minute redosing interval and explains why prophylaxis is timed 5–10 minutes pre-activity [^b17b4ea9].

> Hold on, I should verify formulation-specific details for tablets versus spray. Tablets are available as 0.3 mg, 0.4 mg, and 0.6 mg; typical dosing uses 0.3–0.4 mg, with 0.6 mg reserved for select cases, and the tablet must be placed under the tongue or in the buccal pouch and allowed to dissolve without swallowing [^72e0b581] [^3b2b6430]. For lingual spray, each metered spray delivers 400 mcg (0.4 mg); dosing is 1–2 sprays at onset, repeatable every 5 minutes, not exceeding 3 sprays in 15 minutes, with the same emergency threshold if pain persists [^ad578eff] [^2b6c33f7]. Let me double-check comparative effectiveness: randomized data suggest spray may be more effective and efficient than sublingual tablet for acute relief, with less headache, though both are guideline-endorsed options [^f2ce9bd0].

> Next, I should review special populations and adjustments. In older adults, start at the low end of the range due to higher prevalence of hypotension and comorbidities; no specific dose adjustment is mandated, but caution is prudent [^ab1da5de]. In pregnancy, data are limited; use only if clearly indicated, balancing maternal benefit and potential fetal risk, and avoid breastfeeding given unknown transfer into milk [^ab1da5de]. In pediatrics, safety and efficacy are not established, so use is not recommended outside specialized contexts [^ab1da5de]. For renal impairment, no dose adjustment is required for sublingual nitroglycerin, though clinical judgment remains essential [^6365f062].

> I will now examine absolute contraindications and key precautions, because these override dosing decisions. Nitrates should not be given within 12 hours of avanafil, 24 hours of sildenafil or vardenafil, or 48 hours of tadalafil due to profound hypotension risk; this is a strict prohibition, not a dose modification [^1f3358b2] [^bf99d9f9]. Avoid use in suspected right ventricular infarction, severe hypotension (SBP < 90 mmHg or drop > 30 mmHg below baseline), or hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, and use with caution in volume depletion or valvular stenosis where hypotension may be exaggerated [^1f3358b2] [^09dedb35]. But wait, what if the patient has a headache? Headache is common and dose-related; counsel on acetaminophen use and reassure that tolerance often develops with continued exposure, which supports adherence when clinically appropriate [^09dedb35].

> Let me consider tolerance and drug–drug interactions that could blunt efficacy. Excessive or frequent use leads to nitrate tolerance; minimize total doses and ensure nitrate-free intervals when using long-acting formulations, and avoid coadministration with long-acting nitrates when possible to preserve sublingual efficacy [^09dedb35] [^599d35ea]. I should confirm interaction risks: high-dose aspirin may enhance nitroglycerin's vasodilatory effects, and t-PA coadministration with IV nitroglycerin can reduce thrombolytic efficacy, though the latter pertains to IV therapy rather than sublingual use [^ba0bf69c].

> Next, I should review a practical decision framework and make sure it aligns with guidelines. For acute chest pain compatible with angina, give 0.3–0.4 mg SL or 1–2 sprays promptly, repeat every 5 minutes to a maximum of 3 doses, and escalate to emergency care if pain persists or is atypical; for prophylaxis, administer 5–10 minutes before activity [^1f3358b2] [^3b2b6430]. If the patient is on a PDE5 inhibitor, withhold nitrates according to the time-based rules; if hypotensive or there is concern for RV infarction, avoid nitrates and prioritize hemodynamic stabilization and alternative analgesia [^1f3358b2]. I should double-check that this matches both FDA labeling and contemporary ACS guidance, which it does [^3b2b6430] [^1f3358b2].

> Finally, I need to ensure key counseling points are explicit. Instruct patients to sit when dosing to mitigate orthostatic symptoms, not to chew or swallow tablets, to expect a brief burning or tingling sensation as a sign of proper administration, and to store tablets properly given potency loss with heat and moisture; remind them to seek care after 3 doses without relief or if symptoms differ from their usual angina [^3b2b6430] [^86673282]. For spray, emphasize not inhaling, priming instructions, and checking remaining doses periodically; these steps reduce dosing errors and ensure reliability when needed [^ad578eff] [^2b6c33f7].

Sublingual nitroglycerin is dosed at **0.3–0.4 mg** under the tongue at the first sign of angina, repeated every 5 minutes to a maximum of 3 doses in 15 minutes [^28ea59bc] [^1f3358b2]. If pain persists after 3 doses, seek emergency care [^3b2b6430]. For prophylaxis, take **0.3–0.4 mg** 5–10 minutes before activities that trigger angina [^3b2b6430]. Common side effects include headache and dizziness; avoid use with PDE5 inhibitors and in severe hypotension or right ventricular infarction [^1f3358b2] [^09dedb35].

---

## Indications

Sublingual nitroglycerin is indicated for **acute relief of angina pectoris** due to coronary artery disease [^13ad46cf] and for **prophylaxis** against angina attacks before activities that typically precipitate chest pain [^3b2b6430].

---

## Standard dosing regimen

The **standard dosing regimen** for sublingual nitroglycerin is:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Dose** | **Frequency** | **Maximum dose** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Acute angina attack | 0.3–0.4 mg sublingually | Every 5 minutes as needed | 3 doses in 15 minutes |
| Prophylaxis before activity | 0.3–0.4 mg sublingually | 5–10 minutes before activity | Not specified |

---

If chest pain persists after 3 doses within 15 minutes, or if the pain is different from the usual angina, **seek immediate medical attention** [^3b2b6430].

---

## Administration technique

Proper administration is essential for optimal effect:

- Place the tablet under the tongue or in the buccal pouch and allow it to dissolve completely [^3b2b6430].
- Do not chew, crush, or swallow the tablet [^3b2b6430].
- Sit down when taking the medication to reduce the risk of dizziness or fainting [^3b2b6430].
- If dryness of the mouth interferes with dissolution, a small sip of water may be taken prior to placement [^914c9bd3].

---

## Pharmacokinetics

Sublingual nitroglycerin is rapidly absorbed through the oral mucosa, with onset of action within 1–3 minutes and peak effect at approximately 5 minutes [^b17b4ea9]. The duration of effect is about 25–30 minutes [^notfound]. The drug undergoes rapid metabolism in the liver and vascular walls, resulting in a short half-life of approximately 2–3 minutes [^144471b7].

---

## Clinical considerations and precautions

### Contraindications

Contraindications include **severe hypotension (systolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg)** [^1f3358b2], **hypersensitivity to nitrates**, and concurrent use of **phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) inhibitors** (e.g. sildenafil, tadalafil, vardenafil) due to the risk of profound hypotension [^bf99d9f9].

---

### Precautions

Use with caution in patients with:

- Volume depletion
- Constrictive pericarditis
- Aortic or mitral stenosis
- Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
- Recent myocardial infarction or stroke

---

### Drug interactions

- **PDE5 inhibitors**: Contraindicated due to risk of severe hypotension [^1f3358b2].
- **Other vasodilators**: Additive hypotensive effects.
- **Calcium channel blockers**: Potential additive hypotension.

---

## Side effects

Common side effects include:

- Headache (dose-related and may be severe)
- Dizziness
- Lightheadedness
- Flushing
- Nausea
- Palpitations
- Hypotension (especially orthostatic)

---

## Special populations

### Elderly patients

Start at the **low end of the dosing range** and titrate cautiously due to increased sensitivity and higher risk of hypotension [^ab1da5de].

---

### Pregnant and lactating women

Limited data exist; use only if clearly indicated. It is unknown whether nitroglycerin is excreted in human milk, so **caution is advised** [^ab1da5de].

---

### Pediatric patients

Safety and efficacy have not been established in pediatric patients [^ab1da5de].

---

## Patient education

Patients should be educated on:

- Proper administration technique
- Recognition of angina symptoms
- When to seek emergency care
- Storage of medication (keep tightly closed, protect from light, replace every 3–6 months) [^86673282]
- Potential side effects and drug interactions

---

Sublingual nitroglycerin is a **rapid-acting** medication for acute angina relief and prophylaxis, with a standard dose of 0.3–0.4 mg, repeated every 5 minutes to a maximum of 3 doses. Proper administration, awareness of contraindications, and patient education are essential for safe and effective use.

### The role of nitroglycerin and other nitrogen oxides in cardiovascular therapeutics [^901f1702]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

The use of nitroglycerin in the treatment of angina pectoris began not long after its original synthesis in 1847. Since then, the discovery of nitric oxide as a biological effector and better understanding of its roles in vasodilation, cell permeability, platelet function, inflammation, and other vascular processes have advanced our knowledge of the hemodynamic (mostly mediated through vasodilation of capacitance and conductance arteries) and nonhemodynamic effects of organic nitrate therapy, via both nitric oxide-dependent and -independent mechanisms. Nitrates are rapidly absorbed from mucous membranes, the gastrointestinal tract, and the skin; thus, nitroglycerin is available in a number of preparations for delivery via several routes: oral tablets, sublingual tablets, buccal tablets, sublingual spray, transdermal ointment, and transdermal patch, as well as intravenous formulations. Organic nitrates are commonly used in the treatment of cardiovascular disease, but clinical data limit their use mostly to the treatment of angina. They are also used in the treatment of subsets of patients with heart failure and pulmonary hypertension. One major limitation of the use of nitrates is the development of tolerance. Although several agents have been studied for use in the prevention of nitrate tolerance, none are currently recommended owing to a paucity of supportive clinical data. Only 1 method of preventing nitrate tolerance remains widely accepted: the use of a dosing strategy that provides an interval of no or low nitrate exposure during each 24-h period. Nitric oxide's important role in several cardiovascular disease mechanisms continues to drive research toward finding novel ways to affect both endogenous and exogenous sources of this key molecular mediator.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction, more specifically with respect to nitrates, ACC/AHA 2014 guidelines recommend to administer sublingual nitroglycerin (0.3–0.4 mg) every 5 minutes for up to 3 doses in patients with NSTEMI with continuing ischemic pain, thereafter assess the need for IV nitroglycerin if not contraindicated.

Materials and methods

Literature search

To identify all potentially relevant studies, a systematic search was performed using predefined criteria. PubMed, EMBASE and Web of Science were searched to December 2014. The databases were searched using the subject headings "sublingual nitroglycerin" or "nitroglycerin" or "nitrate" or "nitric oxide donors" and "computed tomography" or "CT" or "CCTA" and "coronary" or "cardiac". No search restrictions were applied. A manual reference check of included articles was performed to identify potential studies missed by our search strategy.

Eligibility Criteria

Article eligibility was determined using predefined criteria. Articles were included based on the following criteria: study domain, patients with suspected or known CAD; index test, CT; evaluation of premedication, nitroglycerin; study results, coronary artery diameter, evaluable segments, objective and subjective (e.g. Likert scale) image quality, systemic physiological effects and diagnostic accuracy. When studies stemmed from overlapping populations, the study with the largest population was included. Animal studies and phantom studies were excluded.

Data Extraction and Analysis

Data were extracted by two reviewers. CT hardware, study design, number of patients, use of β-blockers, heart rate, nitroglycerin dose and time between scan were recorded and summarized. Due to the heterogeneous reporting of outcome measures for each study, a formal meta-analysis was not possible. We thus applied a narrative synthesis of the effect of sublingual nitroglycerin on coronary artery diameter, evaluable segments, objective and subjective image quality, systemic physiological effects and diagnostic accuracy.

8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS

8.1 Pregnancy

Risk summary

Limited published data on the use of nitroglycerin are insufficient to determine a drug associated risk of major birth defects or miscarriage. In animal reproduction studies, there were no adverse developmental effects when nitroglycerin was administered intravenously to rabbits or intraperitoneally to rats during organogenesis at doses greater than 64-times the human dose (see Data).

The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.

Data

Animal Data

No embryotoxic or postnatal development effects were observed with transdermal application in pregnant rabbits and rats at doses up to 80 mg/kg/day and 240 mg/kg/day, respectively, at intraperitoneal doses in pregnant rats up to 20 mg/kg/day from gestation day 7 to 17, and at intravenous doses in pregnant rabbits up to 4 mg/kg/day from gestation day 6 to 18.

8.2 Lactation

Risk summary

Sublingual nitroglycerin has not been studied in lactating women. It is not known if nitroglycerin is present in human milk or if nitroglycerin has effects on milk production.

8.4 Pediatric Use

The safety and effectiveness of nitroglycerin in pediatric patients have not been established.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Clinical studies of nitroglycerin sublingual tablets did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.

### Effects of sublingual nitroglycerin on human uterine contractility during the active phase of labor [^34f263d1]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2002). Low credibility.

Nitroglycerin is administered intravenously in acute obstetric emergencies to relax the uterus. However, complications (eg, hypotension, acute uterine bleeding) are frequent, which prompted a search for alternative routes of administration. We hypothesized that the sublingual administration of nitroglycerin would reduce uterine tone and contractility with few complications. Intrauterine pressure was measured in 12 women who were actively laboring (> 4 cm dilatation, regular contractions) with epidural analgesia and who were alert and responsive throughout the study. In a double-blind fashion, subjects were randomized to receive either placebo or sublingual nitroglycerin (3 doses, 800 microg each) 10 minutes apart. The obstetric anesthesiologist continuously monitored maternal blood pressure and fetal heart rate. Cervical dilatation was assessed at the beginning and the end of the protocol. The area under the intrauterine pressure curve (integral) was used to estimate uterine contractility. Intrauterine pressure was analyzed before the randomization code was broken. Nitroglycerin did not alter the intrauterine pressure integral after the first dose (placebo, 3147 mm Hg x s [95% CI, 2206–4088] vs nitroglycerin, 4146 mm Hg x s [95% CI, 2451–5841]; P = 0.22), second dose (placebo, 3123 mm Hg x s [95% CI, 2447–3799] vs nitroglycerin, 3611 mm Hg x s [95% CI, 2723–4499]; P = 0.28), or third dose (placebo, 3303 mm Hg x s [95% CI, 2616–3990] vs nitroglycerin, 3810 mm Hg x s [95% CI, 2306–5314]; P = 0.45). Cervical dilation, basal uterine tone, duration and frequency of uterine contractions, or fetal heart rhythm remained unaffected. Maternal mean arterial pressure decreased significantly after nitroglycerin was administered. All women were delivered vaginally without intervention. Three doses of sublingual nitroglycerin (800 microg per dose) reduce neither uterine activity nor tone, despite lowering maternal blood pressure. If a clinical option, sublingual nitroglycerin will require a higher dose, which would place mother and fetus at risk for complication.

### A national model for developing, implementing, and evaluating evidence-based guidelines for prehospital care [^8a59ab99]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

Cardiovascular — ACS/STEMI prehospital nitroglycerin dosing and precautions: Nitroglycerin 0.4 mg sublingual (SL), can repeat q (quaque, every) 3–5 minutes if SBP greater than 100 mmHg. The use of nitrates should be avoided in any patient who has used a phosphodiesterase inhibitor within the past 48 hours; examples include sildenafil, vardenafil, tadalafil. Also avoid use in patients receiving intravenous epoprostenol (Flolan®) or treprostinil (Remodulin®) which is used for pulmonary hypertension. Care should always be taken when giving nitroglycerin when the patient's blood pressure is marginal. If used in this setting, the clinician should weigh the risk and benefit of nitrate administration over the administration of an opiate analgesic and be ready to respond to hypotension with fluid bolus or pressor. The location of the infarct does not preclude the use of nitrates, and right-sided leads are of no additional value if an inferior STEMI has been diagnosed; such findings do not preclude the use of nitroglycerin and clinicians should continually monitor hemodynamic status and be prepared to resuscitate if hypotension occurs.

### Nitroglycerin (Nitro-dur) [^17a10c53]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

The suggested starting dose is between 0.2 mg/hr* and 0.4 mg/hr*. Doses between 0.4 mg/hr* and 0.8 mg/hr* have shown continued effectiveness for 10 to 12 hours daily for at least 1 month (the longest period studied) of intermittent administration. Although the minimum nitrate-free interval has not been defined, data show that a nitrate-free interval of 10 to 12 hours is sufficient (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY). Thus, an appropriate dosing schedule for nitroglycerin patches would include a daily patch-on period of 12 to 14 hours and a daily patch-off period of 10 to 12 hours.

*Release rates were formerly described in terms of drug delivered per 24 hours. In these terms, the supplied NITRO-DUR systems would be rated at 2.5 mg/24 hours (0.1 mg/hour), 5 mg/24 hours (0.2 mg/hour), 7.5 mg/24 hours (0.3 mg/hour), 10 mg/24 hours (0.4 mg/hour), and 15 mg/24 hours (0.6 mg/hour).

Although some well-controlled clinical trials using exercise tolerance testing have shown maintenance of effectiveness when patches are worn continuously, the large majority of such controlled trials have shown the development of tolerance (ie, complete loss of effect) within the first 24 hours after therapy was initiated. Dose adjustment, even to levels much higher than generally used, did not restore efficacy.

### Nitroglycerin sustained-release capsules (nitroglycerin slocaps) [^b46deb07]. FDA (2011). Low credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

As noted above (CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY), careful studies with other formulations of nitroglycerin have shown that maintenance of continuous 24- hour plasma levels of nitroglycerin results in tolerance (i.e., loss of clinical response). Every dosing regimen for Nitroglycerin Slocaps® should provide a daily nitrate-free interval to avoid the development of this tolerance. The minimum necessary length of such an interval has not been defined, but studies with other nitroglycerin formulations have shown that 10–12 hours is sufficient. Large controlled studies with other formulations of nitroglycerin show that no dosing regimen with Nitroglycerin Slocaps® should be expected to provide more than about 12 hours of continuous antianginal efficacy per day.

The pharmacokinetics of nitroglycerin capsules, and the clinical effects of multiple-dose regimens, have not been well studied. In clinical trials, the initial regimen of nitroglycerin capsules has been 2.5 to 6.5 mg three to four times a day, with subsequent upward dose adjustment guided by symptoms and side effects. In one trial, 5 of the 18 subjects were titrated up to a dose of 26 mg four times a day.

Short‑acting nitrates for acute angina relief — practical use and comparative formulation data: Short‑acting nitrates help to relieve acute episodes of angina, and administering a short‑acting nitrate prior to activity that typically triggers symptoms can decrease symptoms. In randomized studies, nitroglycerin spray compared with a sublingual formulation is more effective and efficient at relieving angina, with less headache.

### Comprehensive clinical phenotyping of nitroglycerin infusion induced cluster headache attacks [^e95c97a9]. Cephalalgia (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Due to the episodic nature of acute attacks of cluster headache, a standardised and reliable method for triggering attacks is necessary for their complete study. There have been several substances used to trigger attacks, including histamine, meta-chloro-phenylpiperazine (mCPP) and more recently calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). Nitroglycerin (NTG) is the most frequently employed substance in human experimental modelling of cluster headache attacks, being used since 1953 (2) (Table 1).

Table 1.
Review of studies using nitroglycerin to induce cluster headache attacks.

Cluster headache patients suffer from recurrent episodes of severe unilateral pain in the trigeminal region; therefore, historically, the main emphasis has been centred around the pain onset of a cluster headache, and indeed this is often used as the indicator of the start of the attack. However, from clinical practice, there has been growing awareness of nonpainful symptoms preceding the onset of pain and in recent years, the clinical phenotype of cluster headache has been further characterised by retrospective accounts and prospective diaries.

The most frequent route of administration of NTG has been sublingual; however, the bioavailability of sublingual NTG is extremely variable. Therefore, we used a weight-calculated dose for intravenous infusion in a standardised single-blind, placebo-controlled study. NTG is a pro-drug of nitric oxide, with predominant actions on the cyclic guanylate phosphate (cGMP) pathway, and from pre-clinical studies there are indications of neural actions more centrally. This study is the first single-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over study using a weight-adjusted dose of nitroglycerin administered intravenously in cluster headache patients, thereby allowing comprehensive investigation of the various stages of the acute attack of cluster headache.

2.1 Recommended Dosage

Instruct the patient to administer one or two metered sprays (400 mcg of nitroglycerin per spray) at the onset of an attack onto or under the tongue. A spray may be repeated approximately every five minutes as needed. No more than three metered sprays are recommended within a 15-minute period. If the chest pain persists after a total of three sprays, advise prompt medical attention. Nitroglycerin Lingual Spray may be used prophylactically 5 to 10 minutes prior to engaging in activities that might precipitate an acute attack.

2.2 Priming

The pump must be primed prior to the first use. Each metered spray of Nitroglycerin Lingual Spray delivers 48 mg of solution containing 400 mcg of nitroglycerin after an initial priming of five sprays. It will remain adequately primed for 6 weeks. If the product is not used within 6 weeks it can be adequately re-primed with one spray. If the product is not used within 3 months it can be adequately re-primed with up to five sprays. There are 60 or 200 metered sprays per bottle. The total number of available doses is dependent, however, on the number of sprays per use (1 or 2 sprays), and the frequency of priming.

2.3 Administration

Instruct patients that during administration, the patient should rest, ideally in the sitting position. Hold the container vertically with the valve head uppermost and the spray orifice as close to the mouth as possible. Spray the dose preferably onto or under the tongue by pressing the grooved-button firmly and the mouth closed immediately after each dose. THE SPRAY SHOULD NOT BE INHALED. The medication should not be expectorated or the mouth rinsed for 5 to 10 minutes following administration. Instruct patients to familiarize themselves with the position of the spray orifice, which can be identified by the finger rest on top of the valve, in order to facilitate orientation for administration at night [see Patient Information (17)].

The amount of liquid remaining in the container should be checked periodically. The transparent container can be used for continuous monitoring of the consumption. With the container upright and level, check to be sure the end of the center tube extends below the level of the liquid. Once fluid falls below the level of the center tube, remaining sprays will not deliver intended dose.

### Nitroglycerin sustained-release capsules (nitroglycerin slocaps) [^4001ae21]. FDA (2011). Low credibility.

Clinical Trials

Controlled trials of single oral doses of nitroglycerin have demonstrated that nitroglycerin capsules can effectively reduce exercise-related angina for up to 5 hours. Antianginal activity is present about 1 hour after ingestion of a capsule.

Controlled trials of multiple-dose oral nitroglycerin have shown statistically significant antianginal efficacy 21⁄2 and 4 hours after a dose when oral nitroglycerin had been administered four times a day for 2 weeks or three times a day for 1 week. As noted above, careful studies with other formulations of nitroglycerin have shown that maintenance of continuous 24-hour plasma levels of nitroglycerin results in insurmountable tolerance. Presumably, the studied 1-week and 2-week regimens of oral nitroglycerin therapy achieved adequate nitrate-free intervals by non-uniformity of dosing interval, with longer intervals overnight. The investigators did not report how subjects interpreted their dosing instructions, and they similarly did not report which dose of the day was the one after which they obtained the end-of-trial exercise results.

Thus, these studies of oral nitroglycerin should not be interpreted as demonstrations that these regimens provide round-the-clock anti-anginal protection. From large, well-controlled studies of other nitroglycerin formulations, it is reasonable to believe that the maximal achievable daily duration of anti-anginal effect from Nitroglycerin Slocaps® is about 12 hours.

In some controlled trials of other organic nitrate formulations, efficacy has declined with time. Because the controlled, multipledose trials of oral nitroglycerin did not include exercise tests before the last day of treatment, it is not known how the efficacy of Nitroglycerin Slocaps® may vary during extended therapy.

### Nitroglycerin (nitroMist) [^2b6c33f7]. FDA (2020). Medium credibility.

2.1 Recommended Dosage

At the onset of an attack, one metered spray or two metered sprays should be administered on or under the tongue. A spray may be repeated approximately every 5 minutes as needed. If two sprays are used initially, the patient may only administer one more spray after waiting 5 minutes. No more than 3 metered sprays are recommended within a 15-minute period. If chest pain persists after a total of 3 sprays, prompt medical attention is recommended. NitroMist may be used prophylactically 5 minutes to 10 minutes before engaging in activities that might precipitate an acute attack.

2.2 Priming the Container

After an initial priming of 10 sprays, each metered spray of NitroMist delivers 33 mg of solution containing 400 mcg of nitroglycerin. It will remain adequately primed for 6 weeks. If the product is not used within 6 weeks, it can be adequately re-primed with 2 sprays. NitroMist is available in either 230 metered sprays or 90 metered sprays per container, but the total number of available doses depends on the number of sprays per use (1 spray or 2 sprays), and the frequency of priming.

### Sublingual nitroglycerin administration in coronary computed tomography angiography: a systematic review [^4499e9a7]. European Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To systematically investigate the literature for the influence of sublingual nitroglycerin administration on coronary diameter, the number of evaluable segments, image quality, heart rate and blood pressure, and diagnostic accuracy of coronary computed tomography (CT) angiography.

Methods

A systematic search was performed in PubMed, EMBASE and Web of Science. The studies were evaluated for the effect of sublingual nitroglycerin on coronary artery diameter, evaluable segments, objective and subjective image quality, systemic physiological effects and diagnostic accuracy. Due to the heterogeneous reporting of outcome measures, a narrative synthesis was applied.

Results

Of the 217 studies identified, nine met the inclusion criteria: seven reported on the effect of nitroglycerin on coronary artery diameter, six on evaluable segments, four on image quality, five on systemic physiological effects and two on diagnostic accuracy. Sublingual nitroglycerin administration resulted in an improved evaluation of more coronary segments, in particular, in smaller coronary branches, better image quality and improved diagnostic accuracy. Side effects were mild and were alleviated without medical intervention.

Conclusion

Sublingual nitroglycerin improves the coronary diameter, the number of assessable segments, image quality and diagnostic accuracy of coronary CT angiography without major side effects or systemic physiological changes.

Key Points

- Sublingual nitroglycerin administration results in significant coronary artery dilatation.
- Nitroglycerin increases the number of evaluable coronary branches.
- Image quality is improved the most in smaller coronary branches.
- Nitroglycerin increases the diagnostic accuracy of coronary CT angiography.
- Most side effects are mild and do not require medical intervention.

### Are some patient-perceived migraine triggers simply early manifestations of the attack? [^ae29692f]. Journal of Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Nitroglycerin triggering

Following the history and examination, each subject was exposed to a 0.5-mcg/kg/min nitroglycerin infusion over 20 min. Subjects were symptomatically and haemodynamically assessed with blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation monitoring before the infusion and at 5-min intervals during the infusion. Each subject was prospectively questioned regarding the evolution of any headache, its site, severity, phenotype and the presence of any other symptoms, including typical premonitory symptoms using the same physician-administered symptom questionnaire that was used for spontaneous attacks (Fig. 1). Questioning continued at 15-min intervals following the infusion until the time of headache resolution following treatment. The answers to the premonitory symptom question presence were binary (yes/no), without any further grading of intensity or severity.

A premonitory symptom was defined as any symptom that the patient experienced following nitroglycerin infusion in the absence of migraine headache, which was typical for a symptom they would experience prior to a spontaneous migraine headache.

Nitroglycerin is a drug agent with vasodilatory actions and a short half-life (minutes). Within the brain, the vasodilatory drug effects are thought to peak at a similar time, and possibly last for no more than 45 min. Drug side effects typically come on quickly after intravenous administration and usually resolve within 5–10 min. We would, therefore, hope that with the design of the study, drug effects, if any, would be minimal or absent during premonitory symptoms.

Whilst our previous work has looked at symptoms triggered across serial nitroglycerin exposures and following placebo, for this study, we aimed to compare only spontaneous and nitroglycerin-triggered symptoms on the first nitroglycerin exposure.

Treatment of triggered attacks

All delayed migrainous headache following nitroglycerin was treated as soon as it reached moderate-severe intensity, using either 1 g intravenous aspirin or 6 mg subcutaneous sumatriptan, based on subjects' usual response. Headache freedom was necessary before a subject could be discharged from the Research Facility.

### Nitroglycerin reverts clinical manifestations of poor peripheral perfusion in patients with circulatory shock [^8fa6cb3e]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

In the early 1960s, the use of vasodilators in shock started with the interest in flow more than in pressure. This was followed by clinical observations and some experimental studies showing the beneficial effects of vasodilators in severe (irreversible) shock. It took many years before this topic was the subject of additional experimental studies including new techniques to monitor the effects of vasodilators. These findings inspired some clinical investigators to propose the administration of nitroglycerin as a therapeutic approach to recruit the (sublingual) microcirculation in septic shock and cardiogenic shock. Although these studies showed that nitroglycerin is effective in restoring abnormal sublingual microcirculation, the implementation of such a therapeutic approach in clinical practice is still hampered by technical aspects and complex offline analysis of the images.

A real-time evaluation of peripheral microcirculatory disorders would provide bedside assessment for timely application of nitroglycerin targeting improvement in microcirculatory perfusion. In addition, recent observations have demonstrated a significant association between the persistence of abnormalities in peripheral circulation, measured in skin, muscle, or sublingual mucosa, with more severe organ dysfunction and worse prognosis when compared with traditional global variables of resuscitation. Although these abnormalities in peripheral perfusion predict unfavorable outcome in critically ill patients, it still needs to be proven that these abnormalities not only can be treated but also result in improved morbidity or mortality or both. It is reasonable, therefore, that these fundamental questions ideally be answered before the introduction of a new monitoring parameter in clinical practice.

Monitoring of peripheral perfusion can be performed by using simple clinical assessment, in particular, the physical examination by touching the skin or measuring capillary refill time (CRT), body temperature gradient, and optical devices, such as pulse oximeter signal and tissue oxygen saturation (StO 2). We question whether these easy, reliable, and robust clinical parameters of peripheral perfusion can be an effective monitoring approach at the bedside to titrate the beneficial effects of nitroglycerin. Therefore, we designed the present study to address two general hypotheses. First, can nitroglycerin revert abnormal peripheral circulation that persists after initial resuscitation in patients with circulatory shock? Second, is there a dose-dependent effect that would require individualization of the nitroglycerin dose?

### Nitroglycerin lingual [^ba0bf69c]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

In a pharmacokinetic study when a single 0.8 mg dose of nitroglycerin lingual spray was administered to healthy volunteers (n = 24), the mean Cmax and tmax were 1.041 pg/mL and 7.5 minutes, respectively. Additionally, in these subjects the mean area under the curve (AUC) was 12.769 pg/mL · min.

The volume of distribution of nitroglycerin following intravenous administration is 3.3 L/kg.

Drug interactions

Aspirin: Coadministration of nitroglycerin with high dose aspirin (1000 mg) results in increased exposure to nitroglycerin. The vasodilatory and hemodynamic effects of nitroglycerin may be enhanced by concomitant administration of nitroglycerin with high dose aspirin.

Tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA): Concomitant administration of t-PA and intravenous nitroglycerin has been shown to reduce plasma levels of t-PA and its thrombolytic effect.

### Time course of the interaction between tadalafil and nitrates [^bf99d9f9]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

Objectives

This study was designed to determine the time course of nitrate interaction with tadalafil, a phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitor with a half-life (t(1/2)) of 17.5 h.

Background

The PDE5 inhibitors augment the blood pressure (BP)-lowering effects of nitrates, yet the time course of this interaction is unclear. Recent guidelines from the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association recommend that nitrates be withheld for 24 h after taking sildenafil (t(1/2) = 4 h).

Methods

Male subjects (n = 150) received seven consecutive daily doses of placebo or tadalafil (20 mg). On day 7 and beyond, subjects received repeated doses of sublingual nitroglycerin (0.4 mg) after the last dose of placebo or tadalafil. After a 10- to 21-day washout period, subjects crossed over to either placebo or tadalafil, and nitrate dosing was repeated.

Results

In response to nitroglycerin at 4, 8, and 24 h, standing systolic BP fell below 85 mm Hg in more subjects on tadalafil compared with placebo (p < 0.05), with no difference in the response to nitroglycerin at 48, 72, and 96 h (p > 0.2). Similar observations were made for standing diastolic BP < 45 mm Hg, decrease in systolic BP > 30 mm Hg, and decrease in diastolic BP > 20 mm Hg. Nitroglycerin also evoked greater mean maximal decreases in standing systolic BP at 8 and 24 h after taking tadalafil versus placebo (p < 0.02), with no significant difference at 48, 72, or 96 h (p > 0.49).

Conclusions

The hemodynamic interaction between tadalafil and sublingual nitroglycerin lasted 24 h, but was not seen at 48 h and beyond. Similar to other PDE5 inhibitors, tadalafil should not be administered in combination with organic nitrates.

### Nitroglycerin [^b17b4ea9]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Nitroglycerin forms free radical nitric oxide (NO) which activates guanylate cyclase, resulting in an increase of guanosine 3'5' monophosphate (cyclic GMP) in smooth muscle and other tissues. These events lead to dephosphorylation of myosin light chains, which regulate the contractile state in smooth muscle, and result in vasodilatation.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

The principal pharmacological action of nitroglycerin is relaxation of vascular smooth muscle. Although venous effects predominate, nitroglycerin produces, in a dose-related manner, dilation of both arterial and venous beds. Dilation of postcapillary vessels, including large veins, promotes peripheral pooling of blood, decreases venous return to the heart, and reduces left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (preload).

Nitroglycerin also produces arteriolar relaxation, thereby reducing peripheral vascular resistance and arterial pressure (afterload), and dilates large epicardial coronary arteries; however, the extent to which this latter effect contributes to the relief of exertional angina is unclear.

Therapeutic doses of nitroglycerin may reduce systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial blood pressure. Effective coronary perfusion pressure is usually maintained, but can be compromised if blood pressure falls excessively, or increased heart rate decreases diastolic filling time.

Elevated central venous and pulmonary capillary wedge pressures, and pulmonary and systemic vascular resistance are also reduced by nitroglycerin therapy. Heart rate is usually slightly increased, presumably due to a compensatory response to the fall in blood pressure. Cardiac index may be increased, decreased, or unchanged. Myocardial oxygen consumption or demand (as measured by the pressure-rate product, tension-time index, and stroke-work index) is decreased and a more favorable supply-demand ratio can be achieved. Patients with elevated left ventricular filling pressures and increased systemic vascular resistance in association with a depressed cardiac index are likely to experience an improvement in cardiac index. In contrast, when filling pressures and cardiac index are normal, cardiac index may be slightly reduced following nitroglycerin administration.

Consistent with the symptomatic relief of angina, digital plethysmography indicates that onset of the vasodilatory effect occurs approximately 1 to 3 minutes after sublingual nitroglycerin administration and reaches a maximum by 5 minutes postdose. Effects persist for at least 25 minutes following nitroglycerin sublingual tablets administration.

### Sublingual nitroglycerin administration in coronary computed tomography angiography: a systematic review [^95be831c]. European Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

A limitation of this systematic review was that many studies used 16-slice CT, which is considered suboptimal for coronary imaging due to limited temporal resolution compared to current CT scanners. Second, only two studies evaluated the effect of nitroglycerin using an intra-individual comparison. Third, the time between sublingual nitroglycerin administration and scan acquisition was not listed in all of the included studies. Finally, we were not able to meta-analyze our findings due to the heterogeneous reporting of outcome measures.

In conclusion, despite its widespread use in clinical practice, only a few comprehensive studies evaluating the effect of nitroglycerin in coronary CCTA have been published. Our systematic review of the available evidence on the use of sublingual nitroglycerin in CCTA suggests that nitroglycerin improves coronary diameter, the number of assessable segments, image quality, and diagnostic accuracy, although only a few studies met the inclusion criteria. Only mild systemic physiological changes which may impact image quality can be expected if scan acquisition is performed within 4 minutes after nitroglycerin administration. However, the vasodilatory effects of nitroglycerin are reduced in atherosclerotic coronary segments. More studies are needed to assess the effect of nitroglycerin on stenosis assessment and FFR CT measurements, especially when CCTA is performed on current generation scanners.

### Sublingual nitroglycerin administration in coronary computed tomography angiography: a systematic review [^18b8f2fc]. European Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) has become a useful tool for the exclusion of significant coronary artery disease (CAD). CT allows for image acquisition with high spatial and temporal resolution. Nonetheless, it can be challenging to visualize coronary branches with a small diameter. In clinical practice, nitroglycerin is applied for rapid coronary vasodilation, without causing significant changes in heart rate or blood pressure. Nitroglycerin generates nitric oxide, which initiates smooth muscle relaxation independent of endothelial function. Nitroglycerin also reduces the likelihood of coronary artery vasospasm. Nitroglycerin is widely administered to alleviate angina pectoris and has a half-life of about 5 minutes. Sublingual spray is the preferred method of administration since it is the most efficacious and is associated with fewer side effects. In acute myocardial infarction, sublingual nitroglycerin rapidly relieves pulmonary congestion and decreases myocardial oxygen consumption, although administration might result in a decline in cardiac output. Headache and dizziness are most frequently associated with the use of nitrates. Headaches following the use of sublingual nitroglycerin are fairly common, but are generally short-lasting and self-limiting. Dizziness is typically the result of nitroglycerin-induced hypotension. More serious side effects can occur in patients with diminished cardiac output/severe hypotension, in patients with increased intracranial pressure or patients using phosphodiesterase inhibitors. Feldman et al. demonstrated in invasive coronary angiography that small doses of nitroglycerin result in significant coronary artery and collateral dilatation, without significant changes in heart rate and blood pressure. The administration of nitrates was recommended for conventional coronary angiography by the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) in 1999, because it allowed for reliable assessment of coronary stenosis degree. Subsequently, sublingual nitroglycerin has been routinely used to dilate coronary arteries in CCTA examinations to optimize visualization of the coronary artery lumen and thus improve stenosis assessment.

Multiple studies evaluated the use of sublingual nitroglycerin in CCTA, however the evidence has not been systematically reviewed. This systematic review intended to summarize the current evidence on the effects of sublingual nitroglycerin on coronary diameter, the number of evaluable segments, image quality, heart rate and blood pressure, and diagnostic accuracy of CCTA.

### Nitroglycerin (nitroMist) [^e0aa946f]. FDA (2020). Medium credibility.

5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

Tolerance: Excessive use may lead to tolerance (5.1).

5.1 Tolerance

Excessive use may lead to the development of tolerance. Only the smallest number of doses required for effective relief of the acute anginal attack should be used [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2)].

As tolerance to other forms of nitroglycerin develops, the effect of sublingual nitroglycerin on exercise tolerance, although still observable, is reduced.

5.2 Hypotension

Severe hypotension, particularly with upright posture, may occur even with small doses of nitroglycerin. The drug should therefore be used with caution in patients who may be volume-depleted or who, for whatever reason, are already hypotensive. Hypotension induced by nitroglycerin may be accompanied by paradoxical bradycardia and increased angina pectoris.

The benefits of NitroMist in patients with acute myocardial infarction or congestive heart failure have not been established. If one elects to use NitroMist in these conditions, careful clinical or hemodynamic monitoring must be used because of the possibility of hypotension and tachycardia.

5.3 Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy

Nitrate therapy may aggravate the angina caused by hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

5.4 Headache

Nitroglycerin produces dose-related headaches, which may be severe. Tolerance to headaches occurs.

### The effects of sublingual nitroglycerin administration in coronary computed tomography angiography [^7c5ddcc9]. Clinical Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The purpose of our study was to compare coronary luminal diameters in patients undergoing coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) performed with different sublingual nitroglycerin (NTG) spray regimens.

Materials and Methods

We retrospectively reviewed CCTA studies performed in two historical groups (Group 1, single dose nitroglycerin 2 min prior to CCTA, and Group 2, single dose 10 min prior), and a current protocol group (Group 3, single dose at 2 and 10 min prior). Thirty patients were evaluated per group. Two blinded readers measured coronary luminal diameters with comparison of diameter measurements. A third blinded reader assessed image quality of coronary artery segments.

Results

Significant group-level differences in median luminal diameters were identified. Higher median diameters (95% CI) across all segments of 0.40 mm (0.20, 0.60) for Group 2 versus 1 and 0.50 mm (0.30, 0.70) for Group 3 versus 1 were recorded (both P < 0.001). No significant differences in median luminal diameters were found between Groups 2 and 3. No significant differences in image quality were found among the groups apart from higher image quality for the distal LAD for both Groups 2 and 3 compared to Group 1.

Conclusion

Sublingual nitroglycerin spray administered as a single dose at 10 minute dilates coronary arteries more than when only administered at 2 min prior to CCTA. Combined two doses at 10 and 2 min prior to CCTA do not yield further dilatation of coronary arteries.

### Impact of sublingual nitroglycerin dosage on FFRassessment and coronary luminal volume-to-myocardial mass ratio [^025e5b3d]. European Radiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Fractional flow reserve computed tomography (FFR CT) depends upon nitroglycerin (NTG) inducing maximal hyperemia. However, the impact of NTG dosages on FFR CT analysis including coronary volume-to-mass ratio (V/M) is unknown.

Methods

Eighty patients with repeat coronary CT angiograms (CCTAs) with different sublingual spray NTG doses (0.4 mg and 0.8 mg) were retrospectively analyzed with 45 patients excluded. Patient and scan demographics, post-stenosis and nadir FFR CT values, coronary volume, and coronary volume-to-mass ratio (V/M) were compared at initial CCTA (0.4 mg NTG) and follow-up CCTA (0.8 mg NTG). Differences were compared by Wilcoxon signed-rank test.

Results

Thirty-five patients were included (time between CCTAs, 3.9 ± 1.6 years). Segment involvement score was 2.4 ± 3.3 and 2.8 ± 3.4 at initial and repeat CCTA (0.4 and 0.8 mg NTG), respectively (p = 0.004). There was similar image quality (4.1 ± 0.7 vs 4.1 ± 0.8; p = 0.51). Nadir FFR CT values did not differ in the left (0.4 mg, 0.80 ± 0.08 vs 0.8 mg, 0.80 ± 0.03; p = 0.66), right (0.4 mg, 0.90 ± 0.04 vs 0.8 mg, 0.90 ± 0.06; p = 0.25), or circumflex coronaries (0.4 mg, 0.87 ± 0.06 vs 0.8 mg, 0.88 ± 0.06; p = 0.34). Post-stenosis FFR CT values did not differ (p = 0.65). Coronary volume increased with 0.8 mg of NTG (2639 ± 753 mm 3 vs 2844.8 ± 827 mm 3; p = 0.009) but V/M ratio did not (p = 0.20).

Conclusions

Use of 0.8 mg versus 0.4 mg of NTG in routine clinical CCTAs significantly increased coronary volume determined from FFR CT analysis but did not alter FFR CT or V/M. Further evaluation of repeat CCTAs in a more contemporaneous fashion using varied nitrate doses and disease severity is needed.

Key Points

- Fractional flow reserve from computed tomography (FFR CT) is a noninvasive method for evaluating the coronary arteries and relies on nitroglycerin (NTG) to induce coronary vasodilation, but the impact of different NTG dosages is unknown.
- Retrospective analysis evaluated use of different NTG doses on FFR CT.
- Increased NTG dose increased coronary luminal volume on FFR CT analysis, but did not change FFR CT values.

### Sublingual nitroglycerin administration in coronary computed tomography angiography: a systematic review [^c447fb03]. European Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

This systematic review provides an overview of the current evidence on the effect of sublingual nitroglycerin. We found that one to two pumps of sublingual nitroglycerin (0.4–0.8 mg) increased coronary diameter, the number of assessable coronary artery segments, image quality and diagnostic accuracy of CCTA. The administration of nitroglycerin seems to be especially beneficial in smaller coronary branches. We observed among the included studies an increase in the number of evaluable segments as well as an increase in subjective and objective image quality in smaller coronary branches. The spatial resolution of CT may not be sufficiently high to visualize the smallest coronary branches; nevertheless nitroglycerin administration is able to increase the number of evaluable segments.

Sato et al. recorded heart rate and blood pressure every minute during image acquisition and observed significant changes in systemic hemodynamics after 4 minutes. However, only one scan acquisition was acquired and, thus, evaluation of maximal coronary dilatation was not feasible. Pepe et al. observed a maximal vasodilator response between 4 and 5 minutes after nitroglycerin administration using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for visualization of the coronary artery lumen. Also, they noted among their subjects substantial heterogeneity in the time point of maximal coronary dilatation. On the basis of these studies, the optimal starting time for image acquisition is probably between 3 and 4 minutes after sublingual administration of nitroglycerin.

A point of concern is that the administration of nitroglycerin could result in overestimation of the stenosis degree. Conti et al. showed in 47 patients (119 coronary artery stenoses) undergoing conventional angiography that the use of sublingual nitroglycerin results in a significant increase in percentual stenosis (8% mean) and that the more narrowed stenoses were less likely to dilate. This finding could be explained by a decrease in vascular reactivity to nitroglycerin in diseased vessels, especially in atherosclerotic segments with circumferential disease. Another point of concern with the administration of nitroglycerin is that it can result in a decrease in blood pressure or reflex tachycardia. Reflex tachycardia, although rare, could result in more motion artefacts on CCTA. Only Decramer et al. evaluated the effect of nitroglycerin on the presence of substantial artefacts and did not observe significant differences.

### Vericiguat in combination with short-acting nitroglycerin in patients with chronic coronary syndromes: the randomized, phase Ib, VENICE study [^72dd1740]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

Vericiguat is a soluble guanylate cyclase stimulator indicated to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death and heart failure (HF) hospitalization in adults with symptomatic chronic HF and ejection fraction less than 45%. Guidelines recommend short‐acting nitrates, such as sublingual nitroglycerin, for the treatment of acute angina pectoris in patients with chronic coronary syndromes (CCSs), common comorbidities in HF. We evaluated safety, tolerability, and the pharmacodynamic interaction between vericiguat and nitroglycerin, coadministered in patients with CCSs. In this phase Ib, double‐blind, randomized, multicenter study, 36 patients with CCSs received either vericiguat 2.5 mg (up‐titrated every 2 weeks to 5 mg and 10 mg) or placebo. Patients also received nitroglycerin (0.4 mg sublingual). In total, 31 patients completed the study (vericiguat + nitroglycerin, n = 21; placebo + nitroglycerin, n = 10). There was no increase in treatment‐emergent adverse events (TEAEs) with vericiguat + nitroglycerin vs. placebo + nitroglycerin; three patients discontinued due to TEAEs (vericiguat + nitroglycerin, n = 1; placebo + nitroglycerin, n = 2). Decreases in mean blood pressure (BP; 6–10 mmHg systolic BP (SBP); 4–6 mmHg diastolic BP (DBP)) were independent of vericiguat exposure and occurred to a similar extent at trough and peak concentrations with all vericiguat doses and placebo. Coadministration of vericiguat with nitroglycerin in patients with CCSs was well tolerated, and the combination is unlikely to cause significant adverse effects beyond those known for nitroglycerin.

Guidelines recommend short-acting nitrates, such as sublingual nitroglycerin, for the treatment of acute angina pectoris in patients with chronic coronary syndromes (CCSs), common comorbidities in HF. We evaluated safety, tolerability, and the pharmacodynamic interaction between vericiguat and nitroglycerin, coadministered in patients with CCSs. In this phase Ib, double-blind, randomized, multicenter study, 36 patients with CCSs received either vericiguat 2.5 mg (up-titrated every 2 weeks to 5 mg and 10 mg) or placebo. Patients also received nitroglycerin (0.4 mg sublingual). In total, 31 patients completed the study (vericiguat + nitroglycerin, n = 21; placebo + nitroglycerin, n = 10). There was no increase in treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) with vericiguat + nitroglycerin vs. placebo + nitroglycerin; three patients discontinued due to TEAEs (vericiguat + nitroglycerin, n = 1; placebo + nitroglycerin, n = 2). Decreases in mean blood pressure (BP; 6–10 mmHg systolic BP (SBP); 4–6 mmHg diastolic BP (DBP)) were independent of vericiguat exposure and occurred to a similar extent at trough and peak concentrations with all vericiguat doses and placebo. Coadministration of vericiguat with nitroglycerin in patients with CCSs was well tolerated, and the combination is unlikely to cause significant adverse effects beyond those known for nitroglycerin.

Tilt testing methodology — protocol parameters and drug provocation are specified as follows: A supine pre-tilt stabilization phase is "of at least 5 min, when no venous cannulation, and of at least 20 min, when cannulation is undertaken, is recommended" (Class I, Level C); the "Tilt angle between 60 and 70° is recommended" (Class I, Level B); and a "Passive phase of a minimum of 20 min and a maximum of 45 min is recommended" (Class I, Level B). For pharmacologic provocation, "For nitroglycerine, a fixed dose of 300–400 μg sublingually administered in the upright position is recommended" (Class IIa, Level B), and "For isoproterenol, an incremental infusion rate from 1 up to 3 μg/min in order to increase average heart rate by 20–25% over baseline is recommended." In addition, for run-in timing, "in the isoproterenol protocol a pre-tilt phase of stabilization of 20 min is required, whereas with sublingual nitroglycerine the pre-tilt phase can be shortened to 5 min."

### Nitroglycerin reverts clinical manifestations of poor peripheral perfusion in patients with circulatory shock [^2a1ad41e]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

We have demonstrated that intravenous infusion of nitroglycerin improves peripheral perfusion and oxygenation in shock patients with persisting abnormal peripheral circulation following initial resuscitation to global hemodynamic endpoints. Although nitroglycerin is generally used for its cardio-circulatory effects, its precise application in septic or non-septic circulatory shock continues to be debated and investigated. The use of vasodilators in shock was introduced into the clinic in the early 1960s as an additional therapeutic option for circulatory shock with or without cardiac dysfunction to counteract peripheral vasoconstriction. However, the concept of using vasodilator therapy to target microcirculatory flow in critically ill patients originated in the 1990s with clinical trials of different types of vasodilators (prostacyclin and N-acetylcysteine) targeting splanchnic perfusion as assessed by gastric tonometry. These studies demonstrated an improvement in gastric perfusion with vasodilator administration suggesting successful microcirculatory recruitment. More recently, with the advent of video microscopy techniques allowing direct visualization of the (sublingual) microcirculation, some studies have evaluated short-term infusions of nitroglycerin in septic or non-septic shock and demonstrated significant improvements in capillary perfusion. In a randomized controlled trial in 70 patients with septic shock, Boerma and colleagues failed to show significant differences in the evolution of the sublingual microcirculation between the control and nitroglycerin groups. Although this study precluded the effectiveness of nitroglycerin in the sublingual microvascular flow, the fixed dose of nitroglycerin used (2 mg/hour) was able to significantly increase skin blood flow as measured by central-to-toe temperature gradient in the treatment group. In addition to that finding, the authors reported lower Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores in patients who received nitroglycerin compared with the placebo group. In our study, a dose of 2 mg/hour was not sufficient to improve peripheral perfusion in almost 80% of the patients, indicating that the nitroglycerin dose aiming to normalize abnormal peripheral perfusion should be individualized. In addition, since its dose-dependent effect can be easily predicted (Table 4) and the parameters of abnormal peripheral circulation can be easily obtained at the bedside, the use of nitroglycerin to correct an abnormal peripheral circulation can be easily implemented in clinical practice.

### Sublingual nitroglycerin administration in coronary computed tomography angiography: a systematic review [^468439b3]. European Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

The applicability of nitroglycerin in certain subgroups is of interest. Females have smaller coronary arteries compared to males after controlling for differences in body size. Moreover, oestrogen affects vascular tone through production of nitric oxide by the endothelium. However, none of the included studies investigated the effect of nitroglycerin in women compared to men. Another potentially challenging population are hypertensive patients, although in a small study using invasive angiography, no significant change in the lumen area was observed between normotensive and hypertensive patients after administration of sublingual nitroglycerin.

An interesting new field is the effect of nitroglycerin on the diagnostic accuracy of fractional flow reserve CT (FFR CT). Advances in computational fluid dynamics allow for calculation of hemodynamic significance of coronary stenoses in CCTA examinations, which is based on an anatomic model of the coronaries generated from CCTA data. In the DeFACTO study, the effect of sublingual nitroglycerin on diagnostic accuracy of FFR CT was evaluated. Administration of nitroglycerin was linked to improved specificity of FFR CT (55.2% vs. 65.0%). Improvement in the diagnostic accuracy of FFR CT was most profound when nitroglycerin was given 30 minutes or less before the CCTA examination (67.5% vs. 78.6%), which underscores the importance of early image acquisition after administration of sublingual nitroglycerin.

### Challenging the hemodynamic hypothesis in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: is exercise capacity limited by elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure? [^8cb3fbaf]. Circulation (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Exercise intolerance is a defining characteristic of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). A marked rise in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) during exertion is pathognomonic for HFpEF and is thought to be a key cause of exercise intolerance. If true, acutely lowering PCWP should improve exercise capacity. To test this hypothesis, we evaluated peak exercise capacity with and without nitroglycerin to acutely lower PCWP during exercise in patients with HFpEF.

Methods

Thirty patients with HFpEF (70 ± 6 years of age; 63% female) underwent 2 bouts of upright, seated cycle exercise dosed with sublingual nitroglycerin or placebo control every 15 minutes in a single-blind, randomized, crossover design. PCWP (right heart catheterization), oxygen uptake (breath × breath gas exchange), and cardiac output (direct Fick) were assessed at rest, 20 Watts (W), and peak exercise during both placebo and nitroglycerin conditions.

Results

PCWP increased from 8 ± 4 to 35 ± 9 mmHg from rest to peak exercise with placebo. With nitroglycerin, there was a graded decrease in PCWP compared with placebo at rest (-1 ± 2 mmHg), 20W (-5 ± 5 mmHg), and peak exercise (-7 ± 6 mmHg; drug × exercise stage P = 0.004). Nitroglycerin did not affect oxygen uptake at rest, 20W, or peak (placebo, 1.34 ± 0.48 versus nitroglycerin, 1.32 ± 0.46 L/min; drug × exercise P = 0.984). Compared with placebo, nitroglycerin lowered stroke volume at rest (-8 ± 13 mL) and 20W (-7 ± 11 mL), but not peak exercise (0 ± 10 mL).

Conclusions

Sublingual nitroglycerin lowered PCWP during submaximal and maximal exercise. Despite reduction in PCWP, peak oxygen uptake was not changed. These results suggest that acute reductions in PCWP are insufficient to improve exercise capacity, and further argue that high PCWP during exercise is not by itself a limiting factor for exercise performance in patients with HFpEF.

8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS

8.1 Pregnancy

Risk Summary

Limited published data on the use of nitroglycerin are insufficient to determine a drug associated risk of major birth defects or miscarriage. In animal reproduction studies, there were no adverse developmental effects when nitroglycerin was administered intravenously to rabbits or intraperitoneally to rats during organogenesis at doses greater than 64-times the human dose [see Data].

The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively.

Data

Animal Data

No embryotoxic or postnatal development effects were observed with transdermal application in pregnant rabbits and rats at doses up to 80 and 240 mg/kg/day, respectively, at intraperitoneal doses in pregnant rats up to 20 mg/kg/day from gestation day 7 to 17, and at intravenous doses in pregnant rabbits up to 4 mg/kg/day from gestation day 6 to 18.

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

Sublingual nitroglycerin has not been studied in lactating women. It is not known if nitroglycerin is present in human milk or if nitroglycerin has effects on milk production.

8.4 Pediatric Use

The safety and effectiveness of nitroglycerin in pediatric patients have not been established.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Clinical studies of nitroglycerin sublingual tablets did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.

### Open-label study of the stability of sublingual nitroglycerin tablets in simulated real-life conditions [^86673282]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

Contemporary practice favors refilling sublingual nitroglycerin (SL NTG) every 3 to 6 months. This recommendation is based on antiquated data that does not consider the reformulated tablet and the improved manufacturing process. Our objective was to investigate the stability of SL NTG over time using simulated real-life scenarios in comparison to controlled storage conditions. This was an open-label study of 100- and 25-count commercial SL NTG bottles stored in either controlled temperature and relative humidity conditions, or carried in a pocket or purse. SL NTG potency (chemical stability) was assessed using high performance liquid chromatography and physical stability was assessed by changes in tablet weights over time through the labeled expiration date. Both chemical and physical stability of SL NTG were affected by environmental and physical factors. High temperature storage resulted in the most rapid loss of potency. Tablets carried in a pant pocket lost potency faster than those carried in a purse. Potency was also dependent on headspace of the bottle. Tablets stored in the original bottle in a temperate environment could be expected to maintained potency for more than 2 years when carried in a purse, irrespective of package size. When carried in a pant pocket, potency of a 25-count bottle was maintained for 2 years, whereas potency of a 100-count bottle fell below acceptable limits at 12 months. In conclusion, since potency is dependent on temperature, headspace, and carrying practices, frequency of SL NTG refills should be based on individual patient behavior.

### Nitroglycerin transdermal system [^144471b7]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

Pharmacokinetics

The volume of distribution of nitroglycerin is about 3 L/kg, and nitroglycerin is cleared from this volume at extremely rapid rates, with a resulting serum half-life of about 3 minutes. The observed clearance rates (close to 1 L/kg/min) greatly exceed hepatic blood flow. Known sites of extrahepatic metabolism include red blood cells and vascular walls.

The first products in the metabolism of nitroglycerin are inorganic nitrate and the 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerols. The dinitrates are less effective vasodilators than nitroglycerin but they are longer-lived in the serum, and their net contribution to the overall effect of chronic nitroglycerin regimens is not known. The dinitrates are further metabolized to (nonvasoactive) mononitrates and, ultimately, to glycerol and carbon dioxide.

To avoid development of tolerance to nitroglycerin, drug-free intervals of 10–12 hours are known to be sufficient; shorter intervals have not been well studied. In one well-controlled clinical trial, subjects receiving nitroglycerin appeared to exhibit a rebound or withdrawal effect, so that their exercise tolerance at the end of the daily drug-free interval was less than that exhibited by the parallel group receiving placebo.

In healthy volunteers, steady-state plasma concentrations of nitroglycerin are reached by about 2 hours after application of a patch and are maintained for the duration of wearing the system (observations have been limited to 24 hours). Upon removal of the patch, the plasma concentration declines with a half-life of about an hour.

Clinical Trials

Regimens in which nitroglycerin patches were worn for 12 hours daily have been studied in well controlled trials up to 4 weeks in duration. Starting about 2 hours after application and continuing until 10–12 hours after application, patches that deliver at least 0.4 mg of nitroglycerin per hour have consistently demonstrated greater antianginal activity than placebo.

Lower-dose patches have not been as well studied, but in one large, well-controlled trial in which higher-dose patches were also studied, patches delivering 0.2 mg/hr had significantly less antianginal activity than placebo.

It is reasonable to believe that the rate of nitroglycerin absorption from patches may vary with the site of application, but this relationship has not been adequately studied.

The onset of action of transdermal nitroglycerin is not sufficiently rapid for this product to be useful in aborting an acute anginal episode.

### SCCT guidelines for the performance and acquisition of coronary computed tomographic angiography: a report of the Society of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography guidelines committee: endorsed by the north American society for cardiovascular imaging (NASCI) [^6a7ecf2e]. Journal of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography (2016). Medium credibility.

SCCT coronary computed tomographic angiography (coronary CTA) heart rate control and vasodilation — Beta‑blocker use should be considered based upon scanner and patient factors, with a target heart rate set at 60 bpm or less usually appropriate; scanning at a higher heart rate may be acceptable if a target of 60 bpm cannot be reached, and a single low dose of oral beta blockade should be considered to reduce heart rate variability for patients with low resting heart rates. Beta‑blockers should not be used in patients with active bronchospastic disease. Possible ivabradine regimens prior to coronary CTA include 15 mg or 7.5 mg by mouth 1 h before scanning; it may also be used for oral pre‑medication (5 days before) with supplemental IV metoprolol, and in patients with contraindications to beta‑blockers a bolus of IV ivabradine (10 or 15 mg) can be administered to rapidly and safely achieve target heart rate. For coronary vasodilation, nitroglycerin should be administered prior to coronary CTA; a commonly used regimen is 400–800 μg of sublingual nitroglycerin as sublingual tablets or a metered lingual spray (commonly 1–2 tablets or 1–2 sprays) 5 minutes prior to coronary CTA with 800 μg doses by lingual spray preferred, and its use is contraindicated if the patient has recently taken a phosphodiesterase inhibitor. The use of nitroglycerin should be the default protocol but should be withheld in the presence of circumstances of absolute contraindications, and image acquisition should not begin until 5 minutes after the administration to ensure maximal effect.

### Vericiguat in combination with short-acting nitroglycerin in patients with chronic coronary syndromes: the randomized, phase Ib, VENICE study [^8cea8262]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

Study design

The study randomized patients 2:1 to vericiguat or placebo (see Figure 1 for the detailed study design). Patients received multiple oral doses of vericiguat, administered as 1.25‐mg or 5‐mg tablets, or matching placebo.

Figure 1
VENICE study design: vericiguat and nitroglycerin administration in patients with CCSs (chronic coronary syndromes).

The study consisted of three vericiguat treatment periods of 14 days each. Starting dose was 2.5 mg once daily, followed by 5 mg and 10 mg. Vericiguat was administered after breakfast (around 8:00 a.m.). Dose escalation only occurred if the previous dose was well tolerated.

Nitroglycerin sublingual spray (0.4 mg) was administered at screening (priming dose) and on the last 2 days of each treatment period. On the second to last day, nitroglycerin was administered 2.5 hours before vericiguat/placebo dosing (vericiguat trough concentration on Days 12, 16, and 40). On the last day, nitroglycerin was given 4 hours after vericiguat intake (vericiguat peak concentration on Days 13, 27, and 41).

Pharmacokinetics

Blood samples for vericiguat pharmacokinetic (PK) assessments were collected on Day 0 (1 hour and 4 hours after vericiguat intake) and on Days 12, 13, 14, 26, 27, 28, 40, and 41 (in the morning prior to vericiguat intake and 1–4 hours after vericiguat intake). Plasma concentrations of vericiguat also provided information about the patients' adherence to the treatment regimen.

Vericiguat concentrations in plasma were determined using a validated bioanalytical assay. The samples were analyzed using a liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry assay, with a lower limit of quantification of 0.2 ng/mL.

### Practice guidelines for obstetric anesthesia: an updated report by the American society of anesthesiologists task force on obstetric anesthesia and the Society for Obstetric Anesthesia and Perinatology [^9ac54803]. Anesthesiology (2016). Medium credibility.

Retained placenta — anesthetic technique selection and nitroglycerin use are outlined as follows: The literature is insufficient to assess whether a particular anesthetic technique is more effective than another for removal of retained placenta. In general, there is no preferred anesthetic technique for removal of retained placenta, and clinicians should assess hemodynamic status before administering neuraxial anesthesia, consider providing epidural anesthesia if an epidural catheter is in place and the patient is hemodynamically stable, consider aspiration prophylaxis, and titrate sedation/analgesia carefully due to the potential risks of respiratory depression and pulmonary aspiration during the immediate postpartum period; in cases involving major maternal hemorrhage with hemodynamic instability, GA with an endotracheal tube may be considered in preference to neuraxial anesthesia. For uterine relaxation during removal of retained placental tissue, nitroglycerin may be used as an alternative to terbutaline sulfate or general endotracheal anesthesia with halogenated agents, and initiating treatment with incremental doses of IV or sublingual (i.e., tablet or metered dose spray) nitroglycerin may be done to sufficiently relax the uterus.

### Comprehensive clinical phenotyping of nitroglycerin infusion induced cluster headache attacks [^700a8fd8]. Cephalalgia (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study demonstrates that weight-calculated intravenous NTG effectively triggers cluster headache attacks in both chronic cluster headache and episodic cluster headache subjects within bout when compared with placebo. The approach is reliable in terms of triggering a fully-featured attack that allows careful observation of symptoms and their development during acute attacks of cluster headache.

The benefit of weight-calculated intravenous NTG compared to intranasal and sublingual administration is that this is more reliable and has more stable bioavailability. The median time until cluster headache attack onset was 30 minutes (open unblinded NTG visit) and 33 minutes (single-blinded NTG visit), with the overall maximum onset time of 81 minutes. Subjects who did not develop an attack during the 140 minutes of observation were asked to report if they developed an attack later on that day, and none did. The median onset time is similar to the reported latency period reported in the literature (Table 1). The minimum onset time for NTG-induced attacks was 2 minutes, and this is less than reported from the sublingual route, where the shortest time until onset time was 9 minutes; this is expected, given the intravenous route has a half-life of 2.3–2.8 minutes. Two subjects started experiencing mild attack pain before the start of the NTG infusion, and within the placebo group we observed one subject who developed a spontaneous attack. Spontaneous attacks could be anticipated given the subjects are within bout; there were three subjects with only short-lasting CAS symptoms and two subjects who experienced a mild pain without CAS, similar to a shadow.

This study delineates the development of the various stages of an NTG-induced cluster headache attack, including the non-headache symptoms and CAS (Figure 6). The majority of subjects developed NTG headache shortly after the infusion started. This headache was generalised, mild and progressive in nature, predominantly in the bi-occipital and bi-temporal regions. Subjects described it as pressure-like or band-like ache, and they reported it to be distinct from their cluster headache attacks; if there were an overlap, the cluster headache attack would clearly ramp up and supersede the NTG headache. It is difficult to disentangle whether NTG headache developed because there was a high proportion of subjects with either a migraine diagnosis, migraine marker or family history of migraine. However, from a previous study with 25 healthy volunteers without a migraine diagnosis, 16 (64%) developed NTG headache following 0.5 mg NTG sublingual administration.

### Nitrates as an integral part of optimal medical therapy and cardiac rehabilitation for stable angina: review of current concepts and therapeutics [^f2ce16a2]. Clinical Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

The goals of optimal medical therapy in patients with stable angina pectoris are to reduce the risk of cardiovascular mortality and future cardiovascular events, improve exercise capacity, and enhance quality of life. Whereas myocardial revascularization is frequently employed in the management of patients with stable angina, a variety of pharmacologic interventions are recommended as part of optimal medical management. The use of short- and rapidly-acting nitrates (eg, sublingual nitroglycerin spray and tablets) is at the core of the therapeutic armamentarium and should be integrated into optimal medical therapy for stable angina along with exercise therapy. The potential clinical implications from these observations are that prophylactic sublingual nitrates, when combined with cardiac rehabilitation, may allow the patient with angina to exercise to a greater functional capacity than without sublingual nitrates.

### Inhibition of nitrate tolerance without reducing vascular response during eccentric dosing of nitrates [^93c89802]. Hypertension Research (2006). Low credibility.

It has been reported that the nitrate tolerance related to continuous dosing of nitrates reduces drug efficacy, and therefore eccentric dosing of nitrates is recommended. In this study, we investigated the appearance of nitrate tolerance related to continuous dosing of nitrates and prevention of nitrate tolerance during eccentric dosing by comparing the grade of coronary dilatation after sublingual nitroglycerin. Of 26 patients with ischemic heart disease who underwent elective cardiac catheterization, 8 patients were continuously administered nitrates, 8 patients were eccentrically administered nitrates, and 10 patients were not treated. We compared the coronary response to sublingual nitroglycerin among the 3 groups. In a coronary vessel without significant stenosis, the coronary vessel area, coronary lumen area, and mean coronary blood flow velocity after sublingual nitroglycerin were measured using intravascular ultrasound (IVUS). In the continuous dosing group, the maximal rate of change in the vessel area after sublingual nitroglycerin was 105 ± 1 (mean ± SEM) %, significantly lower than those in the untreated group and the eccentric dosing group (114 ± 2%, 114 ± 2%) (p < 0.01, respectively). In conclusion, eccentric dosing of nitrates inhibited the appearance of nitrate tolerance without reducing vascular response.

### Nitroglycerin [^09dedb35]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

Tolerance: Excessive use may lead to tolerance. (5.1)
Hypotension: Severe hypotension may occur. (5.2)

5.1 Tolerance

Excessive use may lead to the development of tolerance. Only the smallest dose required for effective relief of the acute angina attack should be used. A decrease in therapeutic effect of sublingual nitroglycerin may result from use of long-acting nitrates.

5.2 Hypotension

Severe hypotension, particularly with upright posture, may occur with small doses of nitroglycerin particularly in patients with constrictive pericarditis, aortic or mitral stenosis, patients who may be volume- depleted, or are already hypotensive. Hypotension induced by nitroglycerin may be accompanied by paradoxical bradycardia and increased angina pectoris. Symptoms of severe hypotension (nausea, vomiting, weakness, pallor, perspiration and collapse/syncope) may occur even with therapeutic doses.

5.3 Hypertrophic Obstructive Cardiomyopathy

Nitrate therapy may aggravate the angina caused by hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

5.4 Headache

Nitroglycerin produces dose-related headaches, especially at the start of nitroglycerin therapy, which may be severe and persist but usually subside with continued use.

### High-dose nitroglycerin infusion description of safety and efficacy in sympathetic crashing acute pulmonary edema: the HI-DOSE SCAPE study [^f68b7193]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Sympathetic crashing acute pulmonary edema (SCAPE) is a medical emergency in which severe, acute elevation in blood pressure results in acute heart failure and fluid accumulation in the lungs. Without prompt recognition and treatment, the condition often progresses rapidly to respiratory failure necessitating intubation and intensive care unit (ICU) admission. In addition to non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV), high-dose nitroglycerin (HDN) has become a mainstay of treatment; however, an optimal dosing strategy has not been established.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to describe the characteristics and outcomes of patients who received an HDN infusion (≥ 100 μg/min) for the management of SCAPE in the Emergency Department (ED) of a large urban academic medical center. Outcomes were also analyzed to determine predictors of safety and efficacy including use of adjunct medication therapies.

Results

There were 67 adult patients who received HDN infusion for SCAPE from January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2018. The median (IQR) systolic blood pressure (SBP) on initiation of HDN infusion was 211 (192–233) mmHg. Patients were 63% male, 84% black, 51% had a history of heart failure (HF), and 36% had end-stage renal disease (ESRD). IV nitroglycerin (NTG) was initiated at a median (IQR) dose of 100 (100–200) mcg/min with median (IQR) peak rate in the first hour of 200 (127.5–200) mcg/min and an absolute maximum observed rate of 400 μg/min overall. 73% of patients received NIPPV, 48% sublingual (SL) or IV bolus nitroglycerin before HDN infusion, 58% loop diuretic, and 34% angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) or angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB). Rates of ICU admission, intubation, acute kidney injury (AKI) at 48 h, and hypotension were 37%, 21%, 13%, and 4% respectively.

Conclusion

This is the largest to date study describing the use of an HDN infusion (≥ 100 μg/min) strategy for the management of SCAPE. HDN infusion may be a safe alternative strategy to intermittent bolus HDN.

### Chest pain relief by nitroglycerin does not predict active coronary artery disease [^93efd1ff]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Background

The belief that chest pain relief with nitroglycerin indicates the presence of active coronary artery disease is common. However, this hypothesis has not been tested.

Objective

To define the diagnostic and prognostic value of chest pain relief with nitroglycerin.

Design

Prospective observational cohort study.

Setting

Urban community teaching hospital.

Patients

459 consecutive patients with chest pain admitted through the emergency department who received nitroglycerin from emergency services personnel or an emergency department nurse. Follow-up was obtained by telephone contact at 4 months.

Measurements

Chest pain relief was defined as a decrease of at least 50% in patients' self-reported pain within 5 minutes of the initial dose of sublingual or spray nitroglycerin. Active coronary artery disease was defined as any elevated serum enzyme levels, coronary angiography demonstrating a 70% or greater stenosis, or a positive exercise test result.

Results

Nitroglycerin relieved chest pain in 39% of patients (181 of 459). In patients with active coronary artery disease as the likely cause of their chest pain, 35% (49 of 141) had chest pain relief with nitroglycerin. In contrast, in patients without active coronary artery disease, 41% (113 of 275) had chest pain relief (P > 0.2). Four-month clinical outcomes were similar in patients with or without chest pain relief with nitroglycerin (P > 0.2).

Conclusions

These data suggest that, in a general population admitted for chest pain, relief of pain after nitroglycerin treatment does not predict active coronary artery disease and should not be used to guide diagnosis.

5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

5.1 Tolerance

Excessive use may lead to the development of tolerance. Only the smallest dose required for effective relief of the acute angina attack should be used. A decrease in therapeutic effect of sublingual nitroglycerin may result from use of long-acting nitrates.

5.2 Hypotension

Severe hypotension, particularly with upright posture, may occur with small doses of nitroglycerin particularly in patients with constrictive pericarditis, aortic or mitral stenosis, patients who may be volume-depleted, or are already hypotensive. Hypotension induced by nitroglycerin may be accompanied by paradoxical bradycardia and increased angina pectoris. Symptoms of severe hypotension (nausea, vomiting, weakness, pallor, perspiration and collapse/syncope) may occur even with therapeutic doses.

5.3 Hypertrophic Obstructive Cardiomyopathy

Nitrate therapy may aggravate the angina caused by hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

5.4 Headache

Nitroglycerin produces dose-related headaches, especially at the start of nitroglycerin therapy, which may be severe and persist but usually subside with continued use.

WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

- Tolerance: Excessive use may lead to tolerance. (5.1)

- Hypotension: Severe hypotension may occur. (5.2)

### Changes in the numeric descriptive scale for pain after sublingual nitroglycerin do not predict cardiac etiology of chest pain [^675cdf51]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Study Objective

We determine whether the change in numeric descriptive scale for pain after sublingual nitroglycerin use can predict cardiac etiology of chest pain.

Methods

A prospective study of a convenience sample of patients who had chest pain, presented to the emergency department from May 24, 2001, to April 30, 2002, and received sublingual nitroglycerin during their evaluation was performed. The 11-point numeric descriptive scale for chest pain was recorded before and after the initial dose of sublingual nitroglycerin. Cardiac-related pain was defined as chest pain in a patient with a discharge diagnosis of myocardial infarction or the diagnosis of coronary artery disease based on a positive diagnostic study (cardiac catheterization or noninvasive stress imaging). Change in the numeric descriptive scale was divided into 4 categories: (1) significant/complete reduction; (2) moderate reduction; (3) minimal reduction; and (4) no change.

Results

The study cohort was composed of 664 patients: 345 women (52%) and 319 men (48%), mean age 52 years (± 12.4 years). Cardiac-related chest pain was identified in 122 patients (18%). In the overall patient population, 125 (19%) patients had no change in pain, 206 (31%) patients had minimal reduction, 145 (22%) patients had moderate reduction, and 188 (28%) patients had significant or complete reduction in pain. There was no significant difference in any subgroup of numeric descriptive scale response to sublingual nitroglycerin administration in patients with and without a diagnosis of cardiac chest pain.

Conclusion

In this convenience sample, the response of chest pain to sublingual nitroglycerin was not a reliable indicator of a cardiac etiology.

### Nitroglycerin (Nitro-bid) [^82df2081]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Pharmacokinetics: The volume of distribution of nitroglycerin is about 3 L/kg, and nitroglycerin is cleared from this volume at extremely rapid rates, with a resulting serum half-life of about three minutes. The observed clearance rates (close to 1 L/kg/min) greatly exceed hepatic blood flow; known sites of extrahepatic metabolism include red blood cells and vascular walls.

The first products in the metabolism of nitroglycerin are inorganic nitrate and the 1,2- and 1,3-dinitroglycerols. The dinitrates are less effective vasodilators than nitroglycerin, but they are longer-lived in the serum, and their net contribution to the overall effect of chronic nitroglycerin regimens is not known. The dinitrates are further metabolized to (non-vasoactive) mononitrates and, ultimately, to glycerol and carbon dioxide.

To avoid development of tolerance to nitroglycerin, drug-free intervals of 10–12 hours are known to be sufficient; shorter intervals have not been well studied. In one well-controlled clinical trial, subjects receiving nitroglycerin appeared to exhibit a rebound or withdrawal effect, so that their exercise tolerance at the end of the daily drug-free interval was less than that exhibited by the parallel group receiving placebo.

Reliable assay techniques for plasma nitroglycerin levels have only recently become available, and studies using these techniques to define the pharmacokinetics of nitroglycerin ointment have not been reported. Published studies using older techniques provide results that often differ, in similar experimental settings, by an order of magnitude. The data are consistent, however, in suggesting that nitroglycerin levels rise to steady state within an hour or so of application of ointment, and that after removal of nitroglycerin ointment, levels wane with a half-life of about half an hour.

The onset of action of transdermal nitroglycerin is not sufficiently rapid for this product to be useful in aborting an acute anginal episode.

The maximal achievable daily duration of anti-anginal activity provided by nitroglycerin ointment therapy has not been studied. Recent studies of other formulations of nitroglycerin suggest that the maximal achievable daily duration of anti-anginal effect from nitroglycerin ointment will be about 12 hours.

It is reasonable to believe that the rate and extent of nitroglycerin absorption from ointment may vary with the site and square measure of the skin over which a given dose of ointment is spread, but these relationships have not been adequately studied.

### Nitroglycerin (nitroglycerin in dextrose) [^cde5db41]. FDA (2016). Low credibility.

Lower concentrations of Nitroglycerin in 5% Dextrose Injection increase the potential precision of dosing, but these concentrations increase the total fluid volume that must be delivered to the patient. Total fluid load may be a dominant consideration in patients with compromised function of the heart, liver, and/or kidneys. The necessary flow rates to achieve various dose rates with the available concentrations are shown in the following table.

Using nonadsorptive tubing, the initial adult dosage of Nitroglycerin in 5% Dextrose Injection should be 5 mcg/min. Subsequent titration must be guided by the clinical results, with dose increments becoming more cautious as partial response is seen. Initial titration should be in 5 mcg/min increments at intervals of 3 to 5 minutes. If no response is seen at 20 mcg/min, increments of 10 and even 20 mcg/min can be used. Once some hemodynamic response is observed, dosage increments should be smaller and less frequent.

When the concentration is changed, the tubing must be disconnected from the patient and flushed with the new solution before therapy is continued. If this precaution is not taken, then depending upon the tubing, pump, and flow rate used, it might be several hours before nitroglycerin is delivered at the desired rate.

Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Do not administer unless the solution is clear and the seal is intact.

Do not add supplementary medication to Nitroglycerin in 5% Dextrose Injection.

Infusion Rate (mL/h) = [Dose (mcg/min) x 60 min/h]

Concentration (mcg/mL)

Example calculations for infusion rates are as follows:

Example 1: for a dose of 30 µg/min using a 100 mcg/mL concentration, the infusion rate would be as follows:

Infusion Rate (mL/h) = [30 (mcg/min) x 60 (min/h)] = 18 (mL/h)

100 (mcg/mL)

Example 2: for a dose of 240 mcg/min using a 400 mcg/mL concentration, the infusion rate would be as follows:

### Continuous transdermal nitroglycerin therapy for menopausal hot flashes: a single-arm, dose-escalation trial [^c1de1d53]. Menopause (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe the efficacy and tolerability of continuous nitroglycerin for treatment of hot flashes.

Methods

Perimenopausal and postmenopausal women reporting at least seven hot flashes per day were recruited into a single-arm, dose-escalation trial of continuous transdermal nitroglycerin. Participants were started on a generic 0.1mg/hour nitroglycerin patch applied daily without patch-free periods. During 4 weeks, participants escalated dosage weekly to 0.2, 0.4, or 0.6mg/hour as tolerated, then discontinued nitroglycerin during the final week. Changes in hot flash frequency and severity were assessed using symptom diaries. Paired t tests examined change in outcomes between baseline and maximal-dose therapy and after discontinuation of nitroglycerin.

Results

Of the 19 participants, mean age was 51.4 (± 4.3) years. Women reported an average 10.6 (± 3.0) hot flashes and 7.1 (± 3.8) moderate-to-severe hot flashes per day at baseline. Eleven women escalated to 0.6mg/hour, three to 0.4mg/hour, two to 0.2mg/hour, and one remained on 0.1mg/hour nitroglycerin. Two discontinued nitroglycerin before the first outcomes assessment. Among the remaining 17 women, the average daily frequency of hot flashes decreased by 54% and the average frequency of moderate-to-severe hot flashes decreased by 69% from baseline to maximum-dose therapy (P < 0.001 for both). After discontinuing nitroglycerin, participants reported an average 23% increase in frequency of any hot flashes (P = 0.041) and 96% increase in moderate-to-severe hot flashes (P < 0.001).

Conclusions

Continuous nitroglycerin may substantially and reversibly decrease hot flash frequency and severity. If confirmed in a randomized blinded trial, it may offer a novel nonhormonal hot flash treatment.

### Angina severity and symptom improvement are associated with diagnostic acetylcholine provocation dose in vasospastic angina [^a9d2a624]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Questionnaires

After obtaining online informed consent, yearly questionnaires were sent by email. An automated reminder was sent after 7 days. The questionnaires used for this analysis were the Seattle Angina Questionnaire (SAQ) and current use of medication per class. Baseline questionnaires were defined as completed before or on the day of the CFT. All questionnaires completed after that moment were not included in the current baseline analysis of complaints, as potential changes of symptoms after provocation testing might have influenced the results. Follow‐up questionnaires that were completed within 12 ± 6 months after CFT were included in the analysis of anginal complaints at follow‐up.

Assessment of complaints was done by the SAQ, which consists of 19 questions about clinically important domains of health: physical limitation, stability and frequency of complaints, treatment satisfaction, and perceived quality of life. It has been validated in patients with coronary artery disease and is a reproducible, highly sensitive and reliable disease‐specific patient‐reported outcome measure to quantify angina symptoms in that population. The score range is from 0 to 100 for all domains, with lower scores indicating a higher burden of disease. The summary score (SAQSS) aggregates the physical limitation, angina frequency and quality of life domain. The angina frequency score correlates well with daily angina diary entries and sublingual nitroglycerin use and can be categorized follows: 0 to 30 is defined as daily angina, 31 to 60 as weekly, 61 to 99 as monthly, and 100 as no angina. The relationship of Canadian Cardiovascular Society class and SAQSS has also been described previously; a SAQSS of 75 to 100 is equivalent to Canadian Cardiovascular Society class 0 to 1 in 93.6% of patients.

Outcomes

Our main outcomes are the mean angina frequency score at baseline and at follow‐up. Secondary outcomes include the mean SAQSS at baseline and mean change in SAQSS at follow‐up. Additionally, we aimed to assess the proportion of patients improving or deteriorating with regard to clinically important changes in SAQSS, defined as at least 5 points difference on the SAQSS at follow‐up. We also aimed to assess this proportion with regard to angina frequency, for which an increase or decrease of 10 points was considered a relevant change. With these analyses we aim to provide a basis to determine the optimal acetylcholine dosing for a spasm provocation protocol as part of a CFT.

Baseline therapy is to consider aspirin, statin, and ACEI in all patients with sublingual nitroglycerin as needed, along with smoking cessation and lifestyle changes. Antianginal therapy is staged as first line beta blocker (eg, carvedilol 6.25 mg BID uptitrated), second line CCB substituted when beta blockers are not tolerated or ineffective (non DHP eg, verapamil 40 mg BID titrated), and third line add-on options including CCB-DHP (eg, amlodipine) for those on beta blockers, nicorandil 5 mg BID uptitrated, and ranolazine 375 mg BID uptitrated, with nicorandil noted as currently unavailable in the United States.

Evaluable segments

Six CCTA studies evaluated the effect of sublingual nitroglycerin on the number of evaluable segments/branches. All studies showed an improvement in the number of evaluable segments in the nitroglycerin group. Okada et al. observed a non-significant increase in their intra-individual comparison in 52 patients. The effect was particularly profound when only comparing the number of side branches, as was performed by Decramer et al. Lee et al. found a significant improvement in the visibility of second order branches of the left anterior descending (LAD) artery and the right coronary artery (RCA). Chun et al. showed that the application of nitroglycerin resulted in significantly more evaluable distal segments.

Image quality

Two studies found that the administration of sublingual nitroglycerin resulted in significantly better subjective image quality, especially for the posterior descending artery. Decramer et al. did not observe an effect of nitroglycerin on objective measures such as signal-to-noise and contrast-to-noise ratio, nor did they observe a difference in the number of scans with substantial artefacts with the use of sublingual nitroglycerin. Okada et al. did not find a significant difference in subjective image quality. Two studies observed significantly higher intraluminal attenuation in the nitroglycerin group for the more peripheral vessels.

Systemic physiological effects

Three studies observed no significant changes in blood pressure and/or heart rate. Two more extensive studies did observe a significant change in heart rate, though heart rate variability tended to be lower in the group that received nitroglycerin. Okado et al. also observed a notable decrease in systolic (10.6%) and diastolic (9.1%) blood pressure. Sato et al. found significant changes in hemodynamics after 4 minutes. Only a few studies reported on side effects; all were mild (e.g. headache or dizziness) and were alleviated without medical intervention.

The patient subsequently completed 12 5-FU based cycles with a combination of nifedipine, diltiazem, and isosorbide mononitrate prophylaxis without recurrence of any cardiac toxicity.

Because of the concerns regarding recurrent vasospasm with continuous 5-FU and the oncological equipoise between bolus dosing and continuous infusion regimens, we typically switch patients with suspected coronary vasospasm from FOLFOX to bolus dosing 5-FU, leucovorin, oxaliplatin (FLOX) regimens for subsequent outpatient treatments. With capecitabine rechallenge, we continue with oral dosing. For patients with hypertension, we switch antihypertensive medications to a calcium blocker and continue this at a tolerated and effective dose throughout chemotherapy. We pre-treat all patients with 30 to 60 mg of extended-release nifedipine and 30 to 60 mg of isosorbide mononitrate 3 to 4 h before chemotherapy, with dosing dictated by blood pressure. Because 5-FU is preceded by an infusion of leucovorin, we add a second calcium blocker (30 mg of short-acting oral diltiazem) at the start of infusion. The 5-FU bolus is delivered over 12 min. For the first 2 rechallenges, we maintained a presence during bolus and for 30 min subsequently to monitor status. Monitoring continued for 45 to 90 min, and patients were reassessed by cardiology before discharge home. We also kept sublingual nitroglycerin and short-acting nifedipine (10 mg used sublingual) available at the "chairside" for suspected coronary spasm. At home following treatment, we re-dose extended-release nifedipine at a previous dosage after dinner and the following morning (day +1). We routinely call to check patient status the evening after the first cycle, and patients are instructed to call with any symptom in the 36 h following treatment.

5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

Tolerance: Excessive use may lead to tolerance. (5.1)
Hypotension: Severe hypotension may occur. (5.2)

5.1	Tolerance

Excessive use may lead to the development of tolerance. Only the smallest dose required for effective relief of the acute angina attack should be used. A decrease in therapeutic effect of sublingual nitroglycerin may result from use of long-acting nitrates.

5.2	Hypotension

Severe hypotension, particularly with upright posture, may occur with small doses of nitroglycerin particularly in patients with constrictive pericarditis, aortic or mitral stenosis, patients who may be volume-depleted, or are already hypotensive. Hypotension induced by nitroglycerin may be accompanied by paradoxical bradycardia and increased angina pectoris. Symptoms of severe hypotension (nausea, vomiting, weakness, pallor, perspiration and collapse/syncope) may occur even with therapeutic doses.

5.3	Hypertrophic Obstructive Cardiomyopathy

Nitrate therapy may aggravate the angina caused by hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

5.4	Headache

Nitroglycerin produces dose-related headaches, especially at the start of nitroglycerin therapy, which may be severe and persist but usually subside with continued use.

### Effect of nitroglycerin on splanchnic and pulmonary blood volume [^faa42008]. Journal of Nuclear Cardiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Sublingual nitroglycerin (SL NTG) is useful for treating acute decompensated heart failure, possibly by increasing splanchnic capacitance and reducing left ventricular (LV) preload. We evaluated a radionuclide method to study these effects, initially in subjects without heart failure.

Methods and Results

Red blood cells were labelled by an in vitro method. Abdominal and chest images were obtained at rest, showing relative regional blood volumes. The abdomen was then re-imaged during progressive escalation of intrathoracic pressure using continuous positive airway pressure to assess baseline splanchnic capacitance (pressure-volume relationship, PVR) and compliance (slope of PVR). The procedure was repeated after 0.6 mg SL NTG, followed by chest images. Relative splanchnic blood volume increased at rest after SL NTG (P < .002), signifying an increase in splanchnic capacitance. The slope of the splanchnic PVR decreased in proportion to the baseline PVR (P = 0.0014), signifying increased compliance. The relative pulmonary blood volume decreased in proportion to the increase in splanchnic blood volume (P = 0.01).

Conclusions

A semi-quantitative radionuclide method demonstrated the effect of SL NTG for increasing splanchnic capacitance and compliance, with a proportional decrease in pulmonary blood volume. These data may be applied to quantitatively evaluate the importance of splanchnic vasodilation as a mechanism of LV preload reduction in the treatment of heart failure.

### Dose-dependent benefit of nitroglycerin on microcirculation of patients with severe heart failure [^8d517ce6]. Intensive Care Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Introduction

Microcirculatory abnormalities are frequently observed in patients with severe heart failure and correlate to worse outcomes. We tested the hypothesis that nitroglycerin dose-dependently improves perfusion in severe heart failure and that this could be monitored by measuring central-peripheral temperature gradient and with Sidestream Dark Field imaging of the sublingual mucosa.

Methods

A dose-response study was performed in 17 patients with cardiogenic shock (n = 9) or end-stage chronic heart failure (n = 8) admitted to Erasmus University Medical Center. We did hemodynamic measurements at baseline and during increasing infusion rates of nitroglycerin (up to a maximum dose of 133 microg min(-1)). As parameters of tissue perfusion, we measured central-peripheral temperature gradient (delta-T) and sublingual perfused capillary density (PCD).

Results

Nitroglycerin dose-dependently decreased mean arterial pressure (p < 0.001) and cardiac filling pressures (both central venous pressure (CVP) and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure: p < 0.001). It increased cardiac index (p = 0.01). Nitroglycerin decreased delta-T (p < 0.001) and increased sublingual PCD (p < 0.001). Significant changes in delta-T and PCD occurred earlier, i.e., at a lower doses of NTG, than changes in global hemodynamics. Macrohemodynamic and microcirculatory responses to nitroglycerin infusion were consistent in patients with either cardiogenic shock or end-stage chronic heart failure. Changes in microcirculatory parameters occurred independently of changes in cardiac index.

Conclusions

Nitroglycerin dose-dependently increases tissue perfusion in patients with severe heart failure, as observed by a decrease in central-peripheral temperature gradient and an increase in sublingual perfused capillary density.

The magnitude of the global burden of heart failure (HF) is significant. As well as being a growing economic problem, clinical outcomes for patients with chronic HF remain poor, despite the availability of HF therapies and the implementation of current guidelines.

Comorbidities are of great importance in HF, as they add to the complexity of patient management as well as potentially increase mortality risk. Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a major risk factor for HF, and recent guidelines categorize patients with CAD as having acute or chronic coronary syndromes (CCSs). Angina pectoris is a common symptom in patients with HF and CCSs. Short‐acting nitrates, such as nitroglycerin, are recommended for the acute treatment of angina in patients with CCSs, according to recent guidelines.

Vericiguat is an orally administered, direct soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) stimulator indicated to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death and HF hospitalization following a hospitalization for HF or need for outpatient intravenous diuretics in adults with symptomatic chronic HF and ejection fraction less than 45%. Nitric oxide (NO) availability and the functionality of sGC are impaired in HF; this results in a loss of production of the molecular messenger cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), which may contribute to the progression of cardiovascular disease. Vericiguat enhances the NO–sGC–cGMP pathway by directly stimulating sGC through a binding site independent of NO and by sensitizing sGC to endogenous NO., Given that vericiguat and nitroglycerin both act on the NO–sGC–cGMP pathway, and may be coadministered to patients with HF, it is important to understand their potential pharmacodynamic interactions.

In a previous phase I drug–drug interaction study in healthy male subjects (EudraCT number: 2014‐001235‐36; data on file), exposure to vericiguat (5 mg) was not affected by coadministration with nitroglycerin (0.2 mg sublingual), and the combination was generally well tolerated. In this article, we report the results from the phase Ib Vericiguat Nitroglycerin Clinical Interaction (VENICE) study (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02617550; EudraCT number: 2015‐001444‐11), which investigated the hemodynamic effects of vericiguat plus nitroglycerin in patients with CCSs and whether concomitant administration would be well tolerated without clinically significant adverse effects beyond those known for nitroglycerin.

### Intermittent administration of nitroglycerin sublingual powder compared with placebo in outpatients with peripheral artery disease: results of a randomised proof of concept study [^d45c0677]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

Treatment of peripheral artery disease (PAD), Fontaine Stage IIb with vasoactive substances is of limited efficacy and does not last beyond the active treatment. Glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) is a vasodilating agent that relaxes vascular smooth muscle cells. The aim was to prove the concept that GTN sublingual powder has sustained clinical efficacy and adequate safety in these patients.

Methods

This was a multicentre, randomised, double blind, placebo controlled, forced titration, proof of concept study (phase IIa). Patients had a treadmill test at baseline, after 12 weeks of GTN/placebo administration, and at 19 and 26 weeks (without treatment). Primary objectives were an increase in initial claudication distance (ICD) and absolute claudication distance (ACD) at 12 weeks.

Results

Ninety-five patients were screened and 73 randomised, of which 53 patients completed the 12 week treatment phase (GTN 26, placebo 27). At a baseline ICD of 59.2 ± 32.8 m (GTN) and 57.5 ± 39.7 m (placebo), GTN led to a placebo corrected ICD increase of 23.2% vs. baseline (p = .35). Baseline ACD was 105.3 ± 52.9 m (GTN) and 106.1 ± 95.0 m (placebo), and GTN led to a placebo corrected increase of 3.6% (p = .44), with substantial interindividual variation. The change in claudication distance was greater in patients with an ICD of ≥ 50 m at baseline (ΔICD 29.3%; p = .19), and an ACD ≥ 100 m (ΔACD 8.5%; p = .40). The effect lasted beyond the active treatment period as shown by a 49.3% increase in ICD (p = .31) and a 20.6% increase in ACD (p = .21) by week 26. GTN sublingual powder was well tolerated.

Conclusion

Intermittent treatment with nitroglycerin sublingual powder may represent a potential treatment option for patients with PAD stage Fontaine IIb, with an immediate and a sustained effect. The observed increases in ACD and ICD were however not statistically significant in this phase IIa proof of concept study. Further studies are required.

FULL PRESCRIBING INFORMATION 1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets are indicated for the acute relief of an attack or acute prophylaxis of angina pectoris due to coronary artery disease. 2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Administer one tablet under the tongue or in the buccal pouch at the first sign of an acute anginal attack. Allow tablet to dissolve without swallowing. One additional tablet Sections or subsections omitted from the full prescribing information are not listed. may be administered every 5 minutes until relief is obtained. No more than three tablets are recommended within a 15-minute period.

If the pain persists after a total of 3 tablets in a 15-minute period, or if the pain is different than is typically experienced, seek prompt medical attention. Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets may be used prophylactically 5 minutes to 10 minutes. prior to engaging in activities that might precipitate an acute attack. For patients with xerostomia, a small sip of water prior to placing the tablet under the tongue may help maintain mucosal hydration and aid dissolution of the tablet. Administer nitroglycerin sublingual tablets at rest, preferably in the sitting position. of approximately 6 to 7 minutes postdose. Maximum plasma nitroglycerin concentrations and area under the plasma concentration-time curves increase dose-proportionally following 0. 3 mg to
0. 6 mg nitroglycerin sublingual tablets. You should sit down when taking nitroglycerin sublingual tabletsand use caution when you stand up.

This eliminates the possibility of falling due to lightheadedness or dizziness. One tablet should be dissolved under the tongue or in the oral cavity at the first sign of chest pain. The dose may be repeated approximately every 5 minutes, until the chest pain is relieved.

### The migraine postdrome: spontaneous and triggered phenotypes [^b7d4df74]. Cephalalgia (2021). Medium credibility.

Nitroglycerin infusion

Following the history and examination, each subject was exposed to a 0.5 μg/kg/min nitroglycerin infusion over 20 min, to identify those subjects who developed migraine headache. Subjects were symptomatically and haemodynamically assessed with blood pressure, heart rate and oxygen saturation monitoring before the infusion and at 5-min intervals during the infusion, with questioning regarding the evolution of any headache, its site, severity, phenotype and the presence of any other associated migraine symptoms, including premonitory symptoms, using the physician-administered symptom questionnaire shown in Figure 1. Questioning continued at 15-min intervals following the infusion until the time of headache resolution following treatment. All moderate-severe headache meeting criteria for experimental migraine was treated using either 6 mg subcutaneous sumatriptan or 1 g intravenous aspirin, depending on the subjects' usual abortive response. Triptan responders were treated with sumatriptan, whereas non-steroidal anti-inflammatory responders were treated with aspirin. Injectable formulations were chosen because of their more rapid and potent effect. In total, information from 53 nitroglycerin-triggered attacks was captured, and premonitory and postdrome symptomatic data from 44, as these subjects successfully had a migraine headache triggered and treated.

Attack stage definition

A premonitory symptom was defined as any symptom that the patient reliably experienced before the onset of a migraine headache (excluding typical aura). A postdrome symptom was defined as any symptom that the patient experienced following successful abortion of migraine headache with treatment, in the absence of residual migraine headache, which was typical for a symptom they would experience following a spontaneous migraine headache. Mild head discomfort was allowed.

Subjects had to be completely pain free, and free of any migraine symptomatology (premonitory symptoms, headache, and postdrome symptoms), as well as of any acute migraine abortive medication for at least 12 h prior to a visit. None of the subjects in the study used long-acting triptans or abortive medications that we would expect to continue to have an effect on the threshold of nitroglycerin triggering after 12 h.

Clinical cohort

The initial consultation letter from the selected patients' first encounter at the Headache Clinic documents the headache history in detail. Information on premonitory and postdrome symptoms following either treated or spontaneous attack abortion, as well as baseline headache days, migraine diagnosis and acute and preventive headache therapies were collated retrospectively from clinical notes.

### Headache and non-headache symptoms provoked by nitroglycerin in migraineurs: a human pharmacological triggering study [^2ed4641d]. Cephalalgia (2020). Medium credibility.

Triggering

Following the history and examination, each subject was exposed to a 0.5 mcg/kg/min nitroglycerin infusion over 20 minutes, to identify those subjects who developed premonitory symptoms and headache. Subjects were symptomatically and haemodynamically assessed with blood pressure, heart rate and oxygen saturation monitoring before the infusion and at 5-minute intervals during the infusion, with questioning regarding the evolution of any headache, its site, severity, phenotype and the presence of any other symptoms, including typical premonitory symptoms. Questioning continued at 15-minute intervals following the infusion until the time of headache resolution following treatment. The complete symptom questionnaire is shown in Table 2. The answers to the premonitory symptom question presence were binary (yes/no), therefore any reported or observed change from baseline was considered positive.

A premonitory symptom was defined as any symptom that the patient experienced following nitroglycerin infusion in the absence of migraine headache, which was typical for a symptom they would experience prior to a spontaneous migraine headache. The premonitory phase was defined as the presence of at least three typical symptoms for the patient occurring prior to delayed migraine headache. Headache was defined as per the modified experimental migraine criteria for experimental studies. See Figure 1 for a summary of the visit timeline.

Summary of visit timeline for a nitroglycerin-triggered visit.

Nitroglycerin itself is a drug agent with vasodilatory actions, often exploited in cardiology use for coronary vasodilation. The drug can cause side effects: notably reported are headache, tachycardia, hypotension, nausea and vomiting and asthenia. While perhaps asthenia and nausea may be mistaken as premonitory symptoms, the drug half life is short (minutes), and vasodilatory effects are thought to peak at a similar time, and possibly last for no more than 45 minutes within the brain. These side effects typically come on soon after administration, particularly in the case of intravenous administration, and usually resolve within 5–10 minutes of administration. We would therefore considered that with the design of the study, drug effects, if any, would be minimal or absent at the time defined as the premonitory phase of migraine for each subject.
