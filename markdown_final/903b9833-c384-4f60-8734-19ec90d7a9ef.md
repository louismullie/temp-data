## Question

A patient has a microalbumin and creatinine ordered. The urine creatinine is 113.79. The urine microalbumin is > 2000. The urine microalbumin/creatinine ratio is unable to be calculated. What should I do based on the evidence.

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to interpret and manage a urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio that cannot be calculated because the microalbumin result is reported as > 2000 mg/L while the urine creatinine is 113.79 mg/dL, and what the next steps should be to confirm and treat this finding. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what the uncalculable ratio implies about albuminuria severity. Then, I should verify the need for confirmation given biological variability. Next, I will consider transient confounders that could falsely elevate the result. After that, I need to check kidney function and risk-stratify. Then, I will outline immediate management steps, including ACEi/ARB therapy and comprehensive risk reduction. Finally, I will plan monitoring and when to refer to nephrology, ensuring the approach aligns with current guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the clinical implication of an uncalculable ACR when albumin is > 2000 mg/L and creatinine is 113.79 mg/dL; even if I attempt a back-of-the-envelope estimate, 2000 divided by roughly 114 gives an ACR on the order of 17,000 mg/g, which is far into the severely increased (macroalbuminuria) range and suggests nephrotic-range proteinuria, so I should not delay action while waiting for a precise ratio calculation [^111u8JAC] [^112fFSEn].

> Wait, let me verify the confirmation strategy before labeling this as persistent albuminuria; guidelines emphasize that because urinary albumin excretion has high intraindividual variability (about 40% CV), I should confirm with two additional first-morning ACRs over 3–6 months and classify based on 2 of 3 abnormal results, while also excluding transient causes that can spuriously elevate ACR such as recent exercise, fever, uncontrolled hypertension or hyperglycemia, UTI, menstruation, or heart failure [^115F2XKe] [^111VG1ea] [^113rzxmp] [^113JKcU3].

> Hold on, I should verify kidney function and overall risk now; I need a serum creatinine with eGFR using the CKD-EPI 2021 race-free equation, consider cystatin C to improve eGFR accuracy if results are borderline or discordant, and assess for retinopathy if the patient has diabetes, because the combination of severely increased albuminuria with reduced eGFR and/or retinopathy strengthens the diagnosis of diabetic kidney disease and informs prognosis and referral urgency [^113rzxmp] [^11323vJj] [^112FeZxZ].

> I will now examine immediate management steps; if the patient is not already on an ACE inhibitor or ARB, I should initiate one and titrate to blood pressure and albuminuria-lowering targets, monitor serum creatinine and potassium within 1–2 weeks after initiation or dose changes, and continue annual or more frequent labs thereafter, as RAS blockade reduces albuminuria and slows CKD progression in diabetes and other proteinuric CKD [^117GKq7f] [^113rzxmp] [^115Bhbq2].

> Let me consider comprehensive risk reduction; I should optimize glycemic control with guideline-directed therapy, target blood pressure to < 130/80 mmHg if tolerated, add statin therapy for ASCVD risk reduction, moderate dietary sodium to < 2 g/day, and consider dietary protein around 0.8 g/kg/day in later CKD stages, while also reviewing and deprescribing nephrotoxins such as NSAIDs and adjusting other medications to kidney function [^111NEGGb] [^117GKq7f].

> Next, I should review monitoring cadence; for someone with severely increased albuminuria, I will check ACR and eGFR at least every 3–6 months, and sooner if therapies change or if there is a rapid change in values, because a doubling of ACR or a > 20% decline in eGFR exceeds expected biological and analytical variability and warrants evaluation for acute kidney disease or progression [^112g2Y3D] [^112mg1fG].

> But wait, what if this degree of albuminuria reflects nondiabetic pathology; I need to ensure I do not miss alternative etiologies, so if there is active urine sediment, hematuria, rapidly declining eGFR, absence of retinopathy in type 1 diabetes, or atypical features, I should consider glomerulonephritis or other nondiabetic CKD and expedite nephrology referral for further workup, which may include serologies and kidney imaging or biopsy as indicated [^115nMn4q] [^114sthe2].

> I should double-check the laboratory and reporting aspects to avoid future uncalculable results; I will request that the lab report quantitative ACR with appropriate units and to one decimal place, and if albumin exceeds the assay linearity, ask for dilution and recalculation so the exact ACR is available for staging and monitoring, consistent with KDIGO laboratory reporting standards [^111nW6MG] [^117JSXLg].

> In summary, I need to ensure that this severely increased albuminuria is confirmed with two additional first-morning ACRs over 3–6 months after excluding transient causes, assess eGFR and retinopathy to stage CKD and gauge DKD likelihood, initiate ACEi/ARB with close lab follow-up, implement aggressive risk factor modification, monitor ACR and eGFR every 3–6 months, and refer to nephrology if albuminuria is > 300 mg/g, eGFR is < 30 mL/min/1.73 m², or atypical features suggest nondiabetic disease, aligning with KDOQI and KDIGO guidance and contemporary diabetes standards [^112bBHEU] [^113rzxmp] [^117R5P3C].

---

The uncalculable microalbumin/creatinine ratio is due to **albumin exceeding assay limits** (> 2000 mg/L) with normal creatinine (113.79 mg/dL), indicating **severe albuminuria**. Immediate actions: **repeat a first-morning urine ACR** to confirm, **check serum creatinine/eGFR**, and **exclude UTI, hematuria, or acute illness**. If confirmed, **start ACEi/ARB**, optimize blood pressure and glycemic control, and refer to nephrology for evaluation and management [^114dapSw] [^113rzxmp] [^117R5P3C].

---

## Clinical significance of uncalculable microalbumin/creatinine ratio

An uncalculable ratio occurs when **albumin exceeds the assay upper limit** (> 2000 mg/L) while creatinine remains within the normal range, indicating severe albuminuria that exceeds the laboratory's calculable range. This degree of albuminuria is clinically significant and indicates **severe kidney damage**, particularly in the context of diabetes or hypertension [^114cAf7s].

---

## Recommended clinical actions

### Confirmatory testing

- **Repeat urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR)**: Use a first-morning urine sample to confirm the initial result and assess persistence of albuminuria [^1175ZuJn] [^113rzxmp].

- **24-hour urine collection**: Consider a 24-hour urine collection to quantify total protein excretion accurately, especially if the initial result is significantly elevated [^116tVsFs].

- **Urinalysis**: Perform a urinalysis to exclude urinary tract infection (UTI), hematuria, or other acute conditions that may transiently elevate albumin levels [^113JKcU3].

---

### Assessment of kidney function

Serum creatinine and eGFR should be measured to assess overall kidney function and stage CKD [^11323vJj]. Consider **cystatin C** if available to improve eGFR accuracy, particularly in cases of borderline or uncertain kidney function [^117R5P3C].

---

### Clinical evaluation and management

- **Blood pressure control**: Optimize blood pressure control, targeting less than 130/80 mmHg if tolerated, using ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) as first-line therapy [^notfound].

- **Glycemic control**: If the patient has diabetes, optimize glycemic control to reduce albuminuria and slow CKD progression [^117GKq7f].

- **Lifestyle modifications**: Implement dietary changes, weight management, and smoking cessation strategies to reduce cardiovascular risk and slow CKD progression [^notfound].

---

### Specialist referral

Refer to a **nephrologist** for further evaluation and management, particularly if albuminuria is persistent, severe, or accompanied by declining eGFR. Consider **endocrinology referral** if diabetes management needs optimization.

## Potential causes of uncalculable microalbumin/creatinine ratio

| **Category** | **Potential causes** |
|-|-|
| Renal conditions | - Severe diabetic nephropathy <br/> - Hypertensive nephropathy <br/> - Glomerulonephritis <br/> - Nephrotic syndrome <br/> - Rapidly progressive kidney disease [^notfound] |
| Systemic conditions | - Uncontrolled diabetes <br/> - Uncontrolled hypertension <br/> - Acute illness or infection <br/> - Heart failure <br/> - Acute kidney injury [^113JKcU3] |
| Laboratory factors | - Assay limitations <br/> - Analytical errors <br/> - Sample contamination or improper collection [^113JKcU3] |

---

## Clinical implications and risks

An uncalculable microalbumin/creatinine ratio indicates **severe albuminuria**, which is associated with:

- **Progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD)**: Severe albuminuria is a strong predictor of CKD progression and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) [^114ZsWZj].

- **Cardiovascular risk**: Elevated albuminuria is independently associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality [^1168QNvo].

- **Diabetic nephropathy**: In patients with diabetes, severe albuminuria indicates advanced diabetic nephropathy and necessitates aggressive management to prevent further kidney damage [^117GKq7f].

---

## Follow-up and monitoring

Regular monitoring of **urine ACR** should be performed at least annually, or more frequently if clinically indicated [^111ddn4e]. Concurrently, track serum creatinine and eGFR to assess kidney function and detect progression early [^112g2Y3D]. Maintain blood pressure and glycemic control, and reinforce lifestyle modifications to reduce cardiovascular risk and slow CKD progression [^114ZsWZj].

---

An uncalculable microalbumin/creatinine ratio due to albumin exceeding assay limits indicates **severe albuminuria** and significant kidney damage. Confirm with repeat testing, assess kidney function, and initiate appropriate management, including blood pressure control, glycemic control, and specialist referral.

Guideline 1: Screening and diagnosis of diabetic kidney disease (DKD) — patients with diabetes should be screened annually for DKD, with initial screening commencing 5 years after the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes or from diagnosis of type 2 diabetes; screening should include measurement of urinary albumin-creatinine ratio (ACR) in a spot urine sample and measurement of serum creatinine with estimation of glomerular filtration rate (GFR). In the absence of urinary tract infection, an elevated ACR should be confirmed with 2 additional first-void specimens collected over the next 3 to 6 months, and to confirm classification 2 of 3 samples should fall within the microalbuminuric or macroalbuminuric range. Microalbuminuria is defined as an ACR between 30–300 mg/g, and macroalbuminuria is defined as an ACR > 300 mg/g.

Urine albumin reporting and terminology — reporting albumin or total protein as a ratio to urine creatinine helps account for concentration variability in spot samples, but direct conversion from albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) to albumin excretion rate (AER) is cautioned: "Assuming a creatinine excretion of 1 g/d, an ACR of 1,000 mg/g would translate to an albumin excretion rate (AER) of 1,000 mg/d. However, this assumption is not correct". Implementation notes that "Clinicians may be resistant to switching from urine protein to urine albumin", and the commentary states, "we endorse the elimination of 'microalbuminuria' and 'macroalbuminuria' from the diagnostic testing lexicon".

Purpose Of Review

To examine the use of urine total protein compared with albumin measurements to assess and monitor patients with chronic kidney disease.

Recent Findings

Urine albumin or total protein-to-creatinine ratio measurements on a single-voided specimen provide a convenient and reliable alternative to 24-h urine measurements. The majority of studies that inform current renoprotective strategies have relied upon urine total protein measurements. Urine albumin measurements are required to detect microalbuminuria. The proportion of urinary protein composed of albumin is variable and may depend on the underlying renal disease.

Summary

Urine protein-to-creatinine measurements should continue to be used for the assessment and monitoring of patients with nondiabetic chronic kidney disease. Urine albumin-to-creatinine measurements should be reserved for detecting microalbuminuria and monitoring patients with diabetic nephropathy. Further research is required to investigate the relationship between urine total protein and albumin in different renal diseases and to compare the prognostic significance of urine total protein with that of albumin.

### Microalbuminuria constitutes a clinical action item for clinicians in 2021 [^111b3w4D]. The American Journal of Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Chronic kidney disease affects approximately 10% of the population or 800 million people globally, with diabetes being the leading cause. The presence of chronic kidney disease with impaired kidney function or with albuminuria is associated with an increased risk of a progressive loss of renal function and increased risk of cardiovascular disease and excess mortality. Screening for chronic kidney disease is critically important because during the initial stages patients often have no symptoms and because we now have available recently approved multiple interventions that can reduce the high risks dramatically. Screening should be performed with regular measurement of albumin in the urine and creatinine or cystatin C in blood for estimation of kidney function. Regretfully recent data indicates that screening for albuminuria is conducted in only 20%-50% of people at risk depending on the setting. Clinicians need to perform regular screening and concomitant management of risk factors. Recent therapeutic options must be implemented to improve outcomes. Finally, a reduction in albuminuria after initiation of intervention constitutes a treatment target because it indicates improved prognosis.

### Diagnostic accuracy of spot urinary protein and albumin to creatinine ratios for detection of significant proteinuria or adverse pregnancy outcome in patients with suspected pre-eclampsia: systematic review and meta-analysis [^1126ZMbV]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Clinical application

When considering the most appropriate diagnostic threshold for a test in practice, one must consider the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity that relates to threshold. What is acceptable in clinical practice will be determined by the place of the test in the management pathway (such as add-on, triage, or replacement) and the nature of the disease. When considering pre-eclampsia, one would wish a replacement test (stand alone) to limit the number of false negative results, as these women run the risk of developing undetected pre-eclampsia with a risk of serious morbidity and mortality. Women with false positive results will be subjected to increased monitoring and possibly pre-term delivery. Thus, protein to creatinine ratio as a replacement test would ideally use a threshold that maximises sensitivity and specificity. If protein to creatinine ratio were to be used as a triage test, with patients who test positive going on to have a 24 hour urine collection to verify the significant proteinuria, then false negatives need to be minimised but false positives will be identified by the second test, so sensitivity can be maximised at the expense of specificity. Our results can be used to determine the most appropriate threshold for each of these situations.

The findings from the multivariate meta-analysis relate to the accuracy of protein to creatinine ratio at the summary level (that is, averaged across all studies). Considerable heterogeneity exists at any threshold for which two or more studies provide evidence, so the performance of protein to creatinine ratio in an individual study setting may be somewhat different from the summary results presented here. Further research needs to identify the causes of heterogeneity in test accuracy across studies (for example, method of measurement, inaccurate reference standards) and identify those circumstances in which protein to creatinine ratio performs consistently well.

Prevalence of proteinuria also varied considerably across studies and has a big effect on how a protein to creatinine ratio test could be used. Following the protein to creatinine test, high positive and negative predictive values above 0.85 are achieved when the prevalence is high (for example, 0.8; see appendix E). However, when the prevalence is low (for example, 0.2; see appendix C), the negative predictive value remains above 0.85 but positive predictive value is then around 0.4. Thus a negative protein to creatinine ratio remains a good test for ruling out significant proteinuria, but positive tests results may have a high rate of false positives in this low prevalence population. Clinicians thus need to know the prevalence of significant proteinuria in the population and setting under investigation to allow accurate interpretation of the test results

Regarding quality improvement for chronic kidney disease, more specifically with respect to requirements for laboratories, KDIGO 2024 guidelines recommend to implement the following laboratory reporting and handling standards to ensure precision and reliability when evaluating urine samples:

- analyze samples for albumin measurement fresh or stored at 4 °C for up to 7 days

- do not store samples for albumin measurement frozen at -20 °C

- report albumin-to-creatinine ratio in untimed urine samples in addition to urine albumin concentration rather than the concentrations alone

- report to 1 decimal place for albumin-to-creatinine ratio whether mg/mmol or mg/g

- ensure the analytical coefficient of variation of methods to measure urine albumin is < 15%.

Albuminuria

Albuminuria is also a frequently used index of kidney function. The 24-hour urinary albumin concentration (UAC) is considered to be the reference standard. This method entails urine collection commencing immediately after discarding first morning urine and collecting all urine in the same container (including final voided urine next morning) until completion of 24 hours. This method is time-consuming and cumbersome as sample collection errors may occur and patient compliance is usually low. To avoid these limitations, random urine samples can be used for quantification of albuminuria, by calculating the urinary albumin to creatinine ratio (ACR). Here, midstream urines are collected for a random urine sample. It is important that during the 24 hours and spot urine collection period, no heavy muscular work should be done as this will influence the serum creatinine concentration. The ACR has been found to correlate well with 24-hour UAC, with a high sensitivity (ranging between 79% and 87.6%) and specificity (ranging between 87.5% and 95.5%) to detect microalbuminuria.

KDOQI — screening and confirmation of diabetic kidney disease emphasizes that screening can wait until 5 years after the onset of type 1 diabetes, whereas in type 2 diabetes screening at diagnosis is mandatory; elevated albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) should be confirmed in the absence of urinary tract infection, and because albumin excretion rate (AER) has high day-to-day variability, most professional societies recommend confirmation during the subsequent 3 to 6 months using first-voided urinary specimens.

Evaluation of albuminuria — initial testing and confirmation states, "We suggest using the following measurements for initial testing of proteinuria (in descending order of preference, in all cases an early morning urine sample is preferred) (2B); 1) urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR); 2) urine protein-to-creatinine ratio (PCR); 3) reagent strip urinalysis for total protein with automated reading; 4) reagent strip urinalysis for total protein with manual reading". It further specifies, "We recommend that clinical laboratories report ACR and PCR in untimed urine samples in addition to albumin concentration or protein concentrations rather than concentrations alone. (1B)" and "The term microalbumin should no longer be used by laboratories. (Not Graded)". For confirmation, it directs, "Confirm reagent strip positive albuminuria and proteinuria by quantitative laboratory measurement and express as a ratio to creatinine whenever possible", "Confirm ACR ≥ 30 mg/g (≥ 3 mg/mmol) on a random untimed urine with a subsequent early morning urine sample", and "If a more accurate estimate of albuminuria or total proteinuria is required, measure albumin excretion rate or total protein excretion rate in a timed urine sample". When non-albumin proteins are suspected, it adds, "If significant non-albumin proteinuria is suspected, use assays for specific urine proteins (e.g., α1-microglobulin, monoclonal heavy or light chains, [known in some countries as "Bence Jones" proteins]). (Not Graded)".

### Chronic kidney disease: detection and evaluation [^117R5P3C]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Chronic kidney disease affects 47 million people in the United States and is associated with significant health care costs, morbidity, and mortality. Because this disease can silently progress to advanced stages, early detection is critical for initiating timely interventions. Multiple guidelines recommend at least annual screening with serum creatinine, urine albumin/creatinine ratio, and urinalysis for patients with risk factors, particularly diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and a history of cardiovascular disease. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force found insufficient evidence to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for chronic kidney disease in the general population, and the American College of Physicians recommends against screening asymptomatic adults without risk factors. Persistently elevated serum creatinine and albuminuria are diagnostic and prognostic hallmarks of chronic kidney disease. Lower levels of albuminuria are associated with adverse renal and cardiovascular outcomes. Serum cystatin C is a novel biomarker that is most useful when a false-positive decreased estimated glomerular filtration rate calculated from serum creatinine is suspected. New guidelines incorporate albuminuria into the classification framework for chronic kidney disease and elaborate on identification of the disease, the frequency of follow-up, and recommendations for nephrology referral. Nephrology consultation is indicated for patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate less than 30 mL per minute per 1.73 m2, persistent urine albumin/creatinine ratio greater than 300 mg per g or urine protein/creatinine ratio greater than 500 mg per g, or if there is evidence of a rapid loss of kidney function. A multidisciplinary approach between primary care physicians, nephrologists, and other subspecialists for implementing early interventions, providing education, and planning for advanced renal disease is key for effective management.

Children and Adolescents

Glycemic control

Consider age when setting glycemic goals in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes, with less stringent goals for younger children. (E)

Nephropathy

Annual screening for microalbuminuria, with a random spot urine sample for microalbumin-to-creatinine ratio, should be initiated once the child is 10 years of age and has had diabetes for 5 years. (E)
Confirmed, persistently elevated microalbumin levels on two additional urine specimens should be treated with an ACE inhibitor, titrated to normalization of microalbumin excretion if possible. (E)

Hypertension

Treatment of high-normal blood pressure (systolic or diastolic blood pressure consistently between the 90–95th percentile for age, sex, and height) should include dietary intervention and exercise, aimed at weight control and increased physical activity, if appropriate. If target blood pressure is not reached with 6–12 months of lifestyle intervention, pharmacologic treatment should be initiated. (E)
Pharmacologic treatment of high blood pressure (systolic or diastolic blood pressure consistently above the 95th percentile for age, sex, and height or consistently > 130/80 mmHg for adolescents) should be initiated along with lifestyle intervention as soon as the diagnosis is confirmed. (E)
ACE inhibitors should be considered for the initial treatment of hypertension. (E)
The goal of treatment is a blood pressure consistently < 130/80 or below the 90th percentile for age, sex, and height, whichever is lower. (E)

The former gold-standard for detection and quantification of albuminuria is a 24-hour urine collection, which is cumbersome and subject to over and under collection. Instead, measuring a spot uACR correlates well with the 24-hour excretion and is currently recommended for routine practice. Urinary albumin concentration can be increased by physical activity, fever, stress, metabolic perturbations, and other conditions, making first-morning samples optimal. Given the variability in albumin excretion, confirming elevated uACR with repeat testing should be emphasized. The uACR is in the process of being standardized.

While quantitative tests for albuminuria are standard, semi-quantitative approaches have been studied because they may reduce costs, expand access to clinics without laboratory services, and are point-of-care which may allow for immediate identification for clinical counseling and treatment decisions. When studied, semi-quantitative tests have shown reasonable sensitivity, but do not match the quantitative uACR. Given their potential benefits for expansion of access, semi-quantitative is a reasonable screening test in the absence of quantitative uACR availability. Semiquantitative or qualitative screening tests should be positive in > 85% of individuals with A2 or moderately increased albuminuria to be useful for patient screening. A recent international CKD screening review addressed differing approaches to screening versus case finding in low-income, middle-income, and high-income countries with considerations including less expensive urine protein dipstick testing in low-income countries versus a broader population screened with eGFR and uACR and increased interval of screening in high-income countries. Highly motivated and high socioeconomic status individuals will likely prefer additional screening tests with increased frequency, but the benefits of this approach have not been clearly demonstrated. The focus of this review is the impact of the minimum standard screening to overcome potential inequities in CKD care that may be driven by lower uACR testing among individuals with risk conditions and low neighborhood income and low education level that were shown in a recent U.S. study of over 7 million adults with diabetes. See Table 3 for a comparison of the various tests for urinary proteins.

Evaluation of albuminuria — initial testing, confirmation, and interpretation: Use the following measurements for initial testing of albuminuria (in descending order of preference), and in all cases, a first void in the morning midstream urine sample is preferred. If measuring urine protein, use urine protein-to-creatinine ratio (PCR), reagent strip urinalysis for total protein with automated reading, or reagent strip urinalysis for total protein with manual reading. Use more accurate methods when albuminuria is detected using less accurate methods, confirm reagent strip positive albuminuria and/or proteinuria by quantitative laboratory measurement and express as a ratio to urine creatinine wherever possible, and confirm ACR ≥ 30 mg/g (≥ 3 mg/mmol) on a random untimed urine with a subsequent first morning void in the morning midstream urine sample. Understand factors that may affect interpretation of measurements of urine albumin and urine creatinine and order confirmatory tests as indicated.

KDOQI — microalbuminuria and GFR for DKD screening states that microalbuminuria and estimation of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) "satisfy criteria for a screening test for DKD. (Moderate)". Microalbuminuria is described as "an independent risk factor for the development of CKD… and GFR loss… and for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality", with point prevalence varying "from 7% to 22% in type 1… and from 6.5% to 42% in type 2 diabetes", and annual incidence "of 1% to 2%… reported in type 2… and possibly type 1 diabetes". For testing, "the Work Group recommends estimating the ACR [albumin-to-creatinine ratio] in a spot urine sample (preferably the first morning void)", noting that "The sensitivity and specificity of ACR estimates are greater than 85% compared with timed urine collections", and that urinary albumin excretion has "an intraindividual CV of approximately 40%". Estimates of urine albumin excretion are also reported as "available, relatively inexpensive, and easy to perform".

Albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) measurement — factors affecting urinary ACR span preanalytical, biological, storage, non-renal creatinine variation, and analytical domains, including transient elevation in albuminuria from menstrual blood contamination, symptomatic urinary tract infection (UTI), exercise, upright posture (orthostatic proteinuria), or other conditions increasing vascular permeability; intraindividual variability such as intrinsic biological and genetic variability; degradation of albumin before analysis; non-renal causes of variability in creatinine excretion such as age, race, muscle mass, and gender; non-steady state for creatinine in acute kidney injury (AKI); and analytical issues such as creatinine excess ("prozone") effect where samples with very high concentrations of albumin may be reported as low or normal using some assays.

### Microalbuminuria: do we need a new threshold? [^115xrZhi]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2009). Low credibility.

Microalbuminuria (30–300 mg of albumin/24 h) is a well-known independent risk factor for kidney and cardiovascular disease and of mortality in diabetic, hypertensive and in the general population. However, recent studies indicate that increased risk is observed at levels of albuminuria much lower than those currently employed to define microalbuminuria. Such low levels were shown to predict heart disease and death, independent of age, sex, renal function, diabetes, hypertension and lipids, in subjects with cardiovascular disease, hypertension and in the general population; as well as to predict progression to hypertension. Correction of obesity and metabolic derangements lowered levels of albuminuria below 30 mg/24 h to levels not associated with increased risk (5–7 mg/24 h). Despite the lack of outcome studies, there is substantial evidence to indicate that the threshold for defining microalbuminuria (that is, albuminuria associated with increased risk) should be lowered by nearly three to four-fold from the currently defined threshold. It would be advisable that clinical scores and future guidelines would consider including microalbuminuria at the lower rates as an independent risk factor, and as an indication for implementing early intervention. Unfortunately, and despite the abundance of evidence, albuminuria measurements are still underutilized in clinical practice.

The Work Group agrees with the need for standardized quality assessment for UACR (and UPCR) across health systems and supports working toward quality assurance practices with clinical laboratory adoption of certified reference materials for urine albumin, noting that the variability in urine albumin measurements across methods and clinical laboratories has been well-recognized.

Assessment of albuminuria status and renal function

Screening for microalbuminuria can be performed by measurement of the albumin-to-creatinine ratio in a random spot collection (preferred method); 24-h or timed collections are more burdensome and add little to prediction or accuracy. Measurement of a spot urine for albumin only, whether by immunoassay or by using a dipstick test specific for microalbumin, without simultaneously measuring urine creatinine, is somewhat less expensive but susceptible to false-negative and -positive determinations as a result of variation in urine concentration due to hydration and other factors.

Abnormalities of albumin excretion are defined in Table 14. Because of variability in urinary albumin excretion, two of three specimens collected within a 3- to 6-month period should be abnormal before considering a patient to have crossed one of these diagnostic thresholds. Exercise within 24 h, infection, fever, CHF, marked hyperglycemia, and marked hypertension may elevate urinary albumin excretion over baseline values.

Table 14
Definitions of abnormalities in albumin excretion

Information on presence of abnormal urine albumin excretion in addition to level of GFR may be used to stage CKD. The National Kidney Foundation classification (Table 15) is primarily based on GFR levels and therefore differs from other systems, in which staging is based primarily on urinary albumin excretion. Studies have found decreased GFR in the absence of increased urine albumin excretion in a substantial percentage of adults with diabetes. Epidemiologic evidence suggests that a substantial fraction of those with CKD in the setting of diabetes have little or no detectable albuminuria. Serum creatinine should therefore be measured at least annually in all adults with diabetes, regardless of the degree of urine albumin excretion.

Table 15
Stages of CKD

Serum creatinine should be used to estimate GFR and to stage the level of CKD, if present. Estimated GFR (eGFR) is commonly co-reported by laboratories or can be estimated using formulae such as the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) study equation. Recent reports have indicated that the MDRD is more accurate for the diagnosis and stratification of CKD in patients with diabetes than the Cockcroft-Gault formula. GFR calculators are available at.

A. Analytical.

Analytical goals can be related to the degree of biological variation, with less precision required for analytes that vary widely. Detection limits and imprecision data are summarized in Table 7. Commercially available quantitative methods for low levels of albuminuria have documented detection limits of approximately 20 μg/L or less. Within-run imprecision and day-to-day (total) imprecision are well within the analytical goal of approximately 15% and are often considerably less. Most, but not all, methods agree well and support a reference interval of 2–20 μg albumin/mg creatinine.

The within-person variation in albumin excretion is large in people without diabetes and is even higher in patients with diabetes. Howey et al. studied day-to-day variation, over 3–4 weeks, in the 24-h albumin excretion, the concentration of albumin, and the albumin–creatinine ratio. The last two variables were measured in the 24-h urine sample, the first morning void, and random untimed urine collections. In healthy volunteers, the lowest within-person CVs were obtained for the concentration of albumin in the first morning void (36%) and for the albumin–creatinine ratio in that sample (31%). Multiple studies have evaluated the best procedure to assess albuminuria. Most studies have found that the spot urine albumin–creatinine concentration in the first morning void, rather than the 24-h urinary excretion of albumin or the timed collection, is the most practical and reliable technique.

To keep the analytical CV less than half the biological CV, an analytical goal of an 18% CV has been proposed. Alternatively, if the albumin–creatinine ratio is to be used, one may calculate the need for a somewhat lower imprecision (that is, a better precision) to accommodate the lower biological CV for the ratio and the imprecision contributed by the creatinine measurement. Assuming a CV of 5% for creatinine measurement, we calculate a goal of 14.7% for the analytical CV for albumin when it is used to estimate the albumin–creatinine ratio. A goal of 15% appears reasonable to accommodate use of the measured albumin concentration for calculating either the timed excretion rate or the albumin–creatinine ratio.

RECOMMENDATION: SEMIQUANTITATIVE OR QUALITATIVE SCREENING TESTS SHOULD BE POSITIVE IN > 95% OF PATIENTS WITH LOW LEVELS OF ALBUMINURIA TO BE USEFUL FOR SCREENING. POSITIVE RESULTS MUST BE CONFIRMED BY ANALYSIS IN AN ACCREDITED LABORATORY GPP.

### Albumin to creatinine ratio: a screening test with limitations [^115fbVC4]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

The aim of this study is to assess the effects of age on (1) the ability of a spot albumin-creatinine ratio (ACR) to accurately predict 24-hour albumin excretion rate (AER), and (2) the performance of spot ACR as a screening test for microalbuminuria. Three hundred fourteen patients with diabetes aged 18 to 84 years attending a tertiary outpatient clinic underwent one 24-hour urine collection and, immediately after completion, provided one fasting spot morning urine sample. Twenty-four-hour AER and spot ACR were determined. Performance of spot ACR was assessed according to age and sex. Fifty-three percent of men and 32% of women had an AER of 20 microg/min or greater. Multiple regression analysis showed age was an independent predictor of spot ACR. For an AER of 20 microg/min for patients in the age range of 40 to 80 years, there was an increase in corresponding values for spot ACR from 18.2 mg/g (95% confidence interval, 15.6 to 21.3) to 32.5 mg/g (95% CI, 27.5 to 38.4) in men and from 22.1 mg/g (95% CI, 18.0 to 27.1) to 56.4 mg/g (95% CI, 47.2 to 67.4) in women. Using ACR cutoff values of 22.1 mg/g or greater and 30.9 mg/g or greater in conventional units (equivalent to ≥ 2.5 and ≥ 3.5 mg/mmol in SI units) in men and women, the spot ACR provided high sensitivities (men, 95.7%; women, 93.35%) and had excellent receiver operator characteristic curves, respectively. However, the spot ACR false-positive rate increased with age from 15.9% (age, 40 to 65 years) to 31.8% (> 65 years) in men and from 10.5% (age, 45 to 65 years) to 28.3% (> 65 years) in women. Spot ACR is a good screening test for microalbuminuria, but a poor predictor of quantitative AER, and should not be used as a diagnostic test. The increase in spot ACR relative to 24-hour AER with age supports the use of sex- and age-adjusted ACR cutoff values.

Chronic kidney disease in diabetes — assessment with urine albumin and estimated GFR: Screening for albuminuria can be most easily performed by urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) in a random spot urine collection, with albuminuria categories defined as " < 30 mg/g creatinine", " ≥ 30–300 mg/g creatinine", and " ≥ 300 mg/g creatinine". Because of high biological variability of " > 20%", two of three UACR specimens collected within a "3-to 6-month" period should be abnormal before considering moderately or severely elevated albuminuria, and transient factors such as "Exercise within 24 h, infection, fever, heart failure, marked hyperglycemia, menstruation, and marked hypertension may elevate UACR independently of kidney damage". For kidney function, "eGFR persistence < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 and/or an urinary albumin value of > 30 mg/g of creatinine is considered abnormal", the CKD-EPI creatinine equation "was refit without the race variable and should be used for everyone", and "increased use of cystatin C… is suggested in combination with serum creatinine" because combining markers "is more accurate and would support better clinical decisions than either marker alone".

Other drugs, such as diuretics, calcium channel blockers, and β-blockers, should be used as additional therapy to further lower blood pressure in patients already treated with ACE inhibitors or ARBs or as alternate therapy in the rare individual unable to tolerate ACE inhibitors or ARBs.

Studies in patients with varying stages of nephropathy have shown that protein restriction helps slow the progression of albuminuria, GFR decline, and occurrence of ESRD. Protein restriction should be considered particularly in patients whose nephropathy seems to be progressing despite optimal glucose and blood pressure control and use of ACE inhibitor and/or ARBs.

Biochemical tests

Identifying and monitoring diabetes-associated CKD primarily involves the assessment of kidney damage (albuminuria) and kidney function (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR]). The general recommendation is that CKD screening in individuals with diabetes should begin within five years after the diagnosis of T1DM and at the diagnosis of T2DM, which should include measuring urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (uACR) to detect microalbuminuria and serum creatinine (and/or cystatin C) for the calculation of eGFR (Table 2). These biochemical screening tests have practical advantages and limitations.

Current screening recommendations for chronic kidney disease in people with diabetes in low- and middle-income countries

Abbreviations: uACR urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio, eGFR estimated glomerular filtration rate, CKD-EPI Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation

Albuminuria

Albuminuria is a major prognostic factor for CKD progression, morbidity, and mortality from CVD, as it is often the first clinical indicator of CKD in people with diabetes. However, despite albuminuria being a clinically useful tool for predicting prognosis and monitoring response to therapy, there are limitations to its usefulness.

The variability of urinary albumin, the method used to diagnose albuminuria, whether it be urinary albumin excretion rate (uAER), uACR, or by dipstick, has implications in lower-income settings. The assessment of uAER, whether timed or 24-h collections, is a more accurate measure of albumin concentration than uACR; however, it is cumbersome, and the precision of urine collection is questionable, whereas measurement of albumin from spot urine samples, without simultaneously measuring urine creatinine, is less expensive but less accurate. The dipstick test for urinary protein, which is the most frequently used test in LMICs due to its cost-effectiveness and accessibility, is even less accurate, as it is insensitive to reliably detect albumin concentrations in ranges < 300 mg/day, and it correlates poorly with uACR.

Guideline 1. Screening and diagnosis of diabetic kidney disease — Microalbuminuria is the best available test for screening of DKD, but it is imprecise, and markers under study include urinary immunoreactive intact albumin and shed podocytes, genetic risk indicators, blood and/or urine changes in growth factors, cytokines, inflammatory markers, or markers of oxidative stress, and innovative kidney imaging or tissue studies. Appropriately weighted risk algorithms should be derived using predictive variables, including AER within the normalalbuminuric or microalbuminuric range, retinopathy status, clinical and ambulatory blood pressure measurements, glycemic control, lipid levels, age, sex, race, and family history. Improved measures of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) should be developed and may include more reliable creatinine measurement methods, modifications of existing formulas, application of new GFR markers, such as cystatin C, and development of simplified direct GFR measurements. Additional studies on urinary albumin measurements, including predictive values of gender-specific ACR cutoffs, urine collection methods, and processing of urine samples, are warranted, and research questions include the rate of progression of DKD in people with reduced GFR but normal urinary albumin excretion compared with those with elevated urinary albumin excretion, whether regression of albuminuria modifies long-term progression, the effect of promising agents to prevent RCN in CKD across both types of diabetes, and the best common definition of RCN.

### Microalbumin measurement alone or calculation of the albumin / creatinine ratio for the screening of hypertension patients? [^116WWChH]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Spot urine sampling seems to be a reliable screening method for the detection of microalbuminuria in hypertensive patients. It remains unclear whether microalbumin measurement alone or calculation of the albumin/creatinine ratio (ACR) are more reliable for the detection of microalbuminuria in non-selected hypertensive patients.

Methods

Following collection of a spot, midstream urine sample, urine was collected for 24 h for the measurement of microalbumin in 264 hypertensive patients. We compared microalbumin concentration in the spot urine with microalbumin measured in the 24-h urine sample and examined the utility of the ACR in evaluating microalbuminuria in hypertensive patients. Pathologic microalbuminuria was assumed when the microalbumin concentration exceeded 30 mg/l in the 24-h urine sample. Diagnostic performance is expressed in terms of specificity, sensitivity, positive (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV), and area under receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC).

Results

A total of 47 samples (17.8%) showed pathologic microalbuminuria in the 24-h urine sample. The diagnostic performance expressed as AUC was 0.94 (95% CI 0.90–0.98) for microalbumin measurement alone and 0.94 (95% CI 0.89–0.97) for ACR. The PPV and NPV were 44.2 and 97.9% for microalbumin measurement alone. ACR revealed a PPV of 29.3% and a NPV of 96.2% for males and 42.9 and 98% for females, if a cut-off value of 2.5 mg/mmol for males and of 4.0 mg/mmol for females was used.

Conclusions

The ACR did not provide any advantage compared with microalbumin measurement alone, but requires an additional determination of creatinine and the use of gender-specific cut-off values. Therefore, measurement of microalbuminuria alone in the spot urine sample is more convenient in daily clinical practice and should be used as the screening method for hypertensive patients.

We congratulate the KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) work group on their comprehensive work in a broad subject area and agreed with many of the recommendations in their clinical practice guideline on the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease. We concur with the KDIGO definitions and classification of kidney disease and welcome the addition of albuminuria categories at all levels of glomerular filtration rate (GFR), the terminology of G categories rather than stages to describe level of GFR, the division of former stage 3 into new G categories 3a and 3b, and the addition of the underlying diagnosis. We agree with the use of the heat map to illustrate the relative contributions of low GFR and albuminuria to cardiovascular and renal risk, though we thought that the highest risk category was too broad, including as it does people at disparate levels of risk. We add an albuminuria category A4 for nephrotic-range proteinuria and D and T categories for patients on dialysis or with a functioning renal transplant. We recommend target blood pressure of 140/90mm Hg regardless of diabetes or proteinuria, and against the combination of angiotensin receptor blockers with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. We recommend against routine protein restriction. We concur on individualization of hemoglobin A1c targets. We do not agree with routine restriction of sodium intake to < 2g/d, instead suggesting reduction of sodium intake in those with high intake (> 3.3g/d). We suggest screening for anemia only when GFR is < 30mL/min/1.73m(2). We recognize the absence of evidence on appropriate phosphate targets and methods of achieving them and do not agree with suggestions in this area. In drug dosing, we agree with the recommendation of using absolute clearance (ie, milliliters per minute), calculated from the patient's estimated GFR (which is normalized to 1.73m(2)) and the patient's actual anthropomorphic body surface area. We agree with referral to a nephrologist when GFR is < 30mL/min/1.73m(2) (and for many other scenarios), but suggest urine albumin-creatinine ratio > 60mg/mmol or proteinuria with protein excretion > 1g/d as the referral threshold for proteinuria.

Risk factors, prevention, and management of DKD

Definition of DKD and screening

DKD is a clinical diagnosis made based on the presence of albuminuria and/or reduced eGFR, in a person with an established diagnosis of Type 1 diabetes (T1D) or T2D. Table 1 outlines the various methods of measuring albuminuria and their normal ranges using the nomenclature recommended by the latest Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) clinical practice guidelines. These refer to normal to mildly increased, moderately increased and severely increased albuminuria to replace normo, micro- and macroalbuminuria, respectively. In clinical practice recommendations by American Diabetes Association (ADA), normal albumin creatinine ratio (ACR) is defined as < 30 mg/g, and high urinary albumin excretion as ⩾ 30 mg/g.

Table 1.
Various urine albumin collections for defining albuminuria.

The most convenient screening method appears to be a single (preferably early morning) urine sent for ACR, and an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), taken at least annually. If urinary ACR is abnormal, it should be repeated to confirm. Arbitrary cut offs for albuminuria are described, although it is clear that the value is a continuous variable, and may have significant day-to-day differences in an individual person. The presence of mildly elevated ACR, however, does appear to be an early precursor of progression to severely increased albuminuria in many patients, although some may regress to normal albumin excretion due to therapeutic intervention.

A broader term of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in people with diabetes is used to describe people with diabetes who have a reduced eGFR below 60 ml/min/1.73 m 2, irrespective of cause. If albuminuria is not present is such patients, then DKD may be less likely, and alternative diagnoses should be considered.CKD in the absence of albuminuria in an elderly person with diabetes is less likely to progress to ESRD. Other reasons to consider non-diabetic renal disease in people with diabetes and CKD are the absence of retinopathy, rapid deterioration in renal function, active urinary sediment, nephrotic range albuminuria (ACR > 220 mg/mmol), or symptoms/signs of other systemic disease.

Assessing the magnitude of renal impairment

Serum creatinine, a commonly used indicator of renal impairment, shows substantial inter-individual variability due to non-renal factors - mainly due to differences in muscle mass. To quantify accurately the degree of dysfunction, measured levels must be adjusted for the effects of age and gender; for example, to provide an estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR). The equation developed for use in the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) study is now widely used to measure renal function, although it is only valid for an estimated GFR < 60 mL/min (the conventional threshold for chronic kidney disease). To address the limitations of the MDRD equation, the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation has been developed that performs better at higher GFRs. Cystatin C levels provide a more accurate measure of early stages of renal impairment, but this approach is currently not widely adopted.

The simplest and most widespread tool for identifying early changes in renal function is the dipstick test for albumin in early morning urine. Normo-albuminuria is conventionally defined as levels < 30 mg/24 hours, microalbuminuria as 30–299 mg/24 hours, and macroalbuminuria as ≥ 300 mg/24 hours. Alternatively, albuminuria may be expressed as a urinary albumin/creatinine ratio (UACR), macroalbuminuria being ≥ 300 mg/g creatinine. A new definition of total proteinuria and albuminuria has been agreed upon and demonstrated effective (Table 1). This addresses the fallacies associated with the use of the terms "microalbuminuria" and "macroalbuminuria" as being distinct entities. In reality, there is a continuous relationship between albuminuria and cardiovascular and renal outcome, and even low-level albuminuria is associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Although albuminuria is extensively used to identify renal impairment in patients with diabetes, it is possible to have a low estimated GFR (< 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2) despite normoalbuminuria. Such individuals, who are typically older, female, hypertensive and have cardiovascular disease, are as likely to experience a cardiovascular event as people with microalbuminuria and an estimated GFR > 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2. Both parameters should be employed to identify accurately all patients at increased risk of cardiovascular disease.

Albuminuria and proteinuria assessment in HIV-infected persons — detection of albuminuria or proteinuria is the most common method of detecting kidney damage, and KDIGO guidelines recommend albuminuria as the preferred marker for staging CKD. Urine dipstick provides a semiquantitative measure but can substantially underestimate or overestimate true protein excretion depending on hydration status. Twenty-four–hour urine collections are the reference standard for measuring urinary excretion of albumin or protein; the adequacy of a 24-hour collection can be assessed against expected creatinine excretion of 20–25 and 15–20 mg/kg/day in men and women, respectively. The most clinically useful methods for quantifying excretion are the albumin-to-creatinine and the protein-to-creatinine ratios performed on random urine samples; albumin-to-creatinine ratios from random samples (ideally first morning) correlate closely with 24-hour collections. On average, humans excrete approximately 1 g of creatinine in the urine each day, so albumin or protein to creatinine ratios correspond to total daily excretion.

Background

Although measuring albuminuria is the preferred method for defining and staging chronic kidney disease (CKD), total urine protein or dipstick protein is often measured instead.

Objective

To develop equations for converting urine protein-creatinine ratio (PCR) and dipstick protein to urine albumin-creatinine ratio (ACR) and to test their diagnostic accuracy in CKD screening and staging.

Design

Individual participant-based meta-analysis.

Setting

12 research and 21 clinical cohorts.

Participants

919 383 adults with same-day measures of ACR and PCR or dipstick protein.

Measurements

Equations to convert urine PCR and dipstick protein to ACR were developed and tested for purposes of CKD screening (ACR ≥ 30 mg/g) and staging (stage A2: ACR of 30 to 299 mg/g; stage A3: ACR ≥ 300 mg/g).

Results

Median ACR was 14 mg/g (25th to 75th percentile of cohorts, 5 to 25 mg/g). The association between PCR and ACR was inconsistent for PCR values less than 50 mg/g. For higher PCR values, the PCR conversion equations demonstrated moderate sensitivity (91%, 75%, and 87%) and specificity (87%, 89%, and 98%) for screening (ACR > 30 mg/g) and classification into stages A2 and A3, respectively. Urine dipstick categories of trace or greater, trace to +, and ++ for screening for ACR values greater than 30 mg/g and classification into stages A2 and A3, respectively, had moderate sensitivity (62%, 36%, and 78%) and high specificity (88%, 88%, and 98%). For individual risk prediction, the estimated 2-year 4-variable kidney failure risk equation using predicted ACR from PCR had discrimination similar to that of using observed ACR.

Limitation

Diverse methods of ACR and PCR quantification were used; measurements were not always performed in the same urine sample.

Conclusion

Urine ACR is the preferred measure of albuminuria; however, if ACR is not available, predicted ACR from PCR or urine dipstick protein may help in CKD screening, staging, and prognosis.

Point of care testing

The KDIGO 2024 CKD Guideline endorses point of care testing (POCT) for creatinine measurements given the convenience associated with this in some settings, and place less value on the diagnostic accuracy. Given the need to improve the rate of detection of CKD in the community, even in Europe where most health systems are relatively robust, POCT may be an important tool to improve the rates of case finding. POCT for urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (uACR) may be similarly convenient and would permit more complete CKD staging in appropriately selected individuals.

The key practice points from the KDIGO 2024 CKD Guideline are summarized in Table 1. A detailed discussion of the accuracy of POCT devices for creatinine and uACR is beyond the scope of this article, but as discussed in the KDIGO 2024 CKD Guideline, it is important to highlight the potential drawbacks especially in regions where resources may permit more accurate testing. Given the relevant concerns regarding accuracy of the various devices for both creatinine and albuminuria, the potential benefits and harms should be considered and individualized. As with any test it is important that the test is performed when indicated, in patients at risk of CKD. Importantly, a diagnosis of CKD cannot be made on single testing and must be confirmed through nephrology consultation of suspicion of advanced CKD or repeat testing in individuals with higher eGFR and/or lower levels of albuminuria.

Table 1:

KDIGO practice points on POCT for kidney function.

The potential benefits of POCT, as outlined in the KDIGO 2024 CKD Guideline, include the convenience for the patient and the rapidity of obtaining the test result, which permit testing in non-clinical environments (nursing homes, remote areas). For individuals, the convenience may outweigh the concerns about accuracy. In children, the tiny volume of blood required may be an additional advantage, especially if used for follow-up testing once a diagnosis is established. The improved accuracy below an eGFR of 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 improved the value of POCT for those who most require a rapid diagnosis.

POCT may, however, be associated with potential harms, including overdiagnosis and underdiagnosis related to the accuracy concerns. These may differ between devices. The tendency of POCT for creatinine to 'overdiagnose' CKD stage may be beneficial from a clinical perspective in terms of fewer missed cases, however overdiagnosis may cause unnecessary anxiety in some patients. It is important that clinical guidelines and/or referral pathways are in place to ensure appropriate follow-up and management.

### KDOQI clinical practice guidelines and clinical practice recommendations for diabetes and chronic kidney disease [^112cYWvN]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2007). Medium credibility.

KDOQI — screening and diagnosis of diabetic kidney disease (DKD) in diabetes — Most professional societies concerned with diabetes and kidney disease now advocate screening for microalbuminuria in patients with diabetes, and screening should begin after 5 years of type 1 diabetes and at the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes because of the inability to establish the onset of type 2 diabetes with certainty. Because urinary albumin excretion has an intraindividual coefficient of variation (CV) of approximately 40%, multiple positive test results are required for classification. Evidence for the usefulness of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) alone as a screening test for CKD in patients with diabetes is less secure; many patients may have elevated or high-normal GFRs early after diagnosis, so markers of kidney damage are required to detect early stages of CKD, and eGFR alone can only detect CKD stage 3 or worse.

### Guidelines and recommendations for laboratory analysis in the diagnosis and management of diabetes mellitus [^1124NKxH]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

RECOMMENDATION: ACCEPTABLE SAMPLES TO TEST FOR INCREASED URINARY ALBUMIN EXCRETION ARE TIMED COLLECTIONS (e.g. 12 OR 24 h) FOR MEASUREMENT OF THE ALBUMIN CONCENTRATION AND TIMED OR UNTIMED SAMPLES FOR MEASUREMENT OF THE ALBUMIN–CREATININE RATIO B (moderate).

RECOMMENDATION: THE OPTIMAL TIME FOR SPOT URINE COLLECTION IS THE EARLY MORNING. ALL COLLECTIONS SHOULD BE AT THE SAME TIME OF DAY TO MINIMIZE VARIATION. THE PATIENT SHOULD NOT HAVE INGESTED FOOD WITHIN THE PRECEDING 2 h BUT SHOULD BE WELL HYDRATED (i.e. NOT VOLUME DEPLETED) GPP.

B. Preanalytical.

Collection of 24-h samples has disadvantages, specifically because many samples are collected inadequately and because total creatinine is not routinely checked to evaluate the adequacy of collection. The albumin–creatinine ratio is the superior method to predict renal events in patients with type 2 diabetes. The ratio has a within-person biological variation similar to that of the excretion rate and correlates well with both timed excretion and the albumin concentration in a first morning void of urine. For the ratio, a first morning void sample is preferable because this sample has a lower within-person variation than the ratio for a random urine sample taken during the day. Although the ratio appears entirely acceptable for screening, limited data are available on its use in monitoring the response to therapy. Recent post hoc analyses of clinical trials, however, have found that the albumin–creatinine ratio is a reasonable method to assess change over time. For screening, an untimed sample for albumin measurement (without creatinine) may be considered if one uses a concentration cutoff that allows high sensitivity for detecting an increased albumin excretion rate.

Albumin is stable in untreated urine stored at 4°C or 20°C for at least a week. Neither centrifugation nor filtration appears necessary before storage at −20°C or −80°C. Whether a urine sample is centrifuged, filtered, or not treated, the albumin concentration decreases by 0.27%/day at −20°C but shows no decreases over 160 days at −80°C. The urinary albumin excretion rate does not show marked diurnal variation in diabetes but does so in essential hypertension.

### Urine albumin-creatinine ratio versus albumin excretion for albuminuria staging: a prospective longitudinal cohort study [^112sDakR]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Background

New guidelines advocate the use of albumin-creatinine ratio (ACR) in a urine sample instead of 24-hour urinary albumin excretion (UAE) for staging albuminuria. Concern has been expressed that this may result in misclassification for reasons including interindividual differences in urinary creatinine excretion.

Study Design

Prospective longitudinal cohort study.

Setting & Participants

We examined 7,623 participants of the PREVEND and RENAAL studies for reclassified when using ACR instead of 24-hour UAE, the characteristics of reclassified participants, and their outcomes. Albuminuria was categorized into 3 ACR and UAE categories: < 30, 30 to 300, and > 300mg/g or mg/24 h, respectively.

Predictors

Baseline ACR and 24-hour UAE.

Outcomes

Cardiovascular (CV) morbidity and mortality and all-cause mortality.

Results

When using ACR in the early morning void instead of 24-hour UAE, 88% of participants were classified in corresponding albuminuria categories. 307 (4.0%) participants were reclassified to a higher, and 603 (7.9%), to a lower category. Participants who were reclassified to a higher ACR category in general had a worse CV risk profile compared with nonreclassified participants, whereas the reverse was true for participants reclassified to a lower ACR category. Similarly, Cox proportional hazards regression analyses showed that reclassification to a higher ACR category was associated with a tendency for increased risk for CV morbidity and mortality and all-cause mortality, whereas reclassification to a lower ACR category was associated with a tendency for lower risk. Net reclassification improvement, adjusted for age, sex, and duration of follow-up, was 0.107 (P = 0.002) for CV events and 0.089 (P < 0.001) for all-cause mortality.

Limitations

Early morning void urine collection instead of spot urine collection.

Conclusions

Our results indicate that there is high agreement between early morning void ACR and 24-hour UAE categories. Reclassification is therefore limited, but when present, is generally indicative of the presence of CV risk factors and prognosis.

### The urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio: assessment of its performance in the renal transplant recipient population [^112Fb8uy]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2011). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Microalbuminuria predicts graft loss and death in the renal transplant population. Measurement of the urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) is recommended for its detection. There is uncertainty regarding the optimal UACR cutoff values. Few studies have examined the accuracy of UACR in the general population and none have been conducted in renal transplant recipients. The aim of this study is to determine the performance of UACR in the renal transplant population.

Design, Setting, Participants & Measurements

Renal transplant recipients with a daily urinary albumin excretion rate of up to 300 mg accurately carried out a 24-hour urine collection and provided a morning urine sample for the measurement of albuminuria and UACR. The performance measures of UACR for the detection of microalbuminuria (30 to 300 mg/d) were calculated using different cutoffs.

Results

Median albuminuria was 23 mg/d, and median UACR was 17 mg/g. The area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve was 0.94 in men and 0.98 in women. The optimal cutoff was 21 mg/g in men and 24 mg/g in women. In men, the 30-, 17-, and 21-mg/g cutoffs provided a sensitivity of 0.79, 0.89, and 0.87. In women, the 30-, 25-, and 24-mg/g cutoffs provided a sensitivity of 0.90, 0.97, and 1.0.

Conclusions

These data show that in the renal transplant population, lower gender-specific cutoffs should be used for the detection of microalbuminuria than the recommended 30-mg/g cutoff. These data support the need for a reappraisal of the 30-mg/g cutoff for the detection of microalbuminuria.

Figure 2.
Conceptual framework of a CKD testing, risk stratification, and treatment program, see reference.

a) Blood pressure measurements as hypertension is the most prevalent risk factor for kidney disease worldwide.
b) Body Mass Index (BMI) since obesity is epidemiologically associated with CKD risk indirectly through T2DM and hypertension and as an independent risk factor. Visceral adiposity contributes to monocyte microinflammation and cardiometabolic kidney risk.
c) Testing for diabetes with glycosylated hemoglobin or fasting blood sugar or random glucose is part of kidney health assessment as T2DM is a common risk factor.
d) Evaluating kidney function by using serum creatinine to estimate GFR (eGFR), is recommended in all settings.GFR should be estimated with a validated, race-free equation appropriate for the country or region and age group. In general, the eGFR < 60 ml/min/1.73m 2 is the threshold for CKD in adults and children, although a threshold of < 90 ml/min/1.73m 2 can be flagged as "low" in children and adolescents over the age of 2 years. A limitation of creatinine-based eGFR is that creatinine is also a marker of nutrition and muscle mass. Therefore, states of malnutrition and frailty overestimate kidney function. Thus, eGFR using the combination of serum creatinine and cystatin C is generally more accurate than either biomarker alone in most clinical contexts. However, the feasibility of cystatin C use is mainly limited to HICs because of assay availability and cost relative to creatinine.
e) Testing for kidney damage (albuminuria). In adults and children, a first-morning sample is preferred for assessing albuminuria. In adults, quantitative urinary albumin-creatinine ratio (uACR) is preferred as the most sensitive test. Importantly, urinary albumin is in the process of being standardized analytically, which should ultimately facilitate worldwide uACR standardization. In children, both protein-creatinine ratio (uPCR) and uACR should be tested in order to assess tubular proteinuria. Semiquantitative albuminuria testing allows for flexibility for point-of-care or home-based testing. Semiquantitative or qualitative screening tests should be positive in > 85% of individuals with quantitative uACR 30 mg/g or more to be useful. In resource-constrained settings, urine protein dipstick testing may be used with a threshold of + 2 proteinuria or greater to reduce false positive results for repeat confirmatory testing.

### The definition, classification, and prognosis of chronic kidney disease: a KDIGO controversies conference report [^114cAf7s]. Kidney International (2011). Low credibility.

The definition and classification for chronic kidney disease was proposed by the National Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (NKF-KDOQI) in 2002 and endorsed by the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) in 2004. This framework promoted increased attention to chronic kidney disease in clinical practice, research and public health, but has also generated debate. It was the position of KDIGO and KDOQI that the definition and classification should reflect patient prognosis and that an analysis of outcomes would answer key questions underlying the debate. KDIGO initiated a collaborative meta-analysis and sponsored a Controversies Conference in October 2009 to examine the relationship of estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and albuminuria to mortality and kidney outcomes. On the basis of analyses in 45 cohorts that included 1,555,332 participants from general, high-risk, and kidney disease populations, conference attendees agreed to retain the current definition for chronic kidney disease of a GFR < 60 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) or a urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio > 30 mg/g, and to modify the classification by adding albuminuria stage, subdivision of stage 3, and emphasizing clinical diagnosis. Prognosis could then be assigned based on the clinical diagnosis, stage, and other key factors relevant to specific outcomes. KDIGO has now convened a workgroup to develop a global clinical practice guideline for the definition, classification, and prognosis of chronic kidney disease.

Screening and diagnosis of diabetic kidney disease — ACR should be measured in first-void urine samples, but if a random urine specimen is abnormal, the second test could be done in a first-voided morning sample obtained within the subsequent 3 to 6 months. Screening for microalbuminuria in patients with type 2 diabetes, if leading to multifactorial interventions, can result in reduced risks of cardiovascular events, progression of albuminuria, and development or progression of retinopathy and neuropathy, whereas similar studies in patients with type 1 diabetes are lacking. International control between laboratories should be established, and there should also be standardized reporting of ACRs with internationally agreed-upon categorical definitions.

### Value of urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio as a predictor of type 2 diabetes in pre-diabetic individuals [^114yMu8q]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

Identifying a simple, safe, and inexpensive tool to improve prediction of future diabetes would be an important public health achievement, especially in light of the ongoing diabetes pandemic. Preliminary results from several observational studies raise the possibility that low levels of ACR could play such a role, with further (indirect) evidence being that proteinuria-reducing antihypertensive agents are associated with a reduced risk of incident diabetes. However, in the present study, the largest study of pre-diabetic individuals to date, we did not find that ACR had any independent predictive value.

Our study hypothesis was not necessarily dependent upon a causal link between increasing ACR and onset of diabetes. For example, one possible premise is that exposure to levels of glycemia below what is conventionally considered pathological induces changes in renal handling of urinary albumin, which in turn would lead to increased ACR. Alternatively, increased ACR could simply be one of a number of early, organ-specific manifestations of insulin resistance that herald the onset of diabetes. Regardless, we felt it important to test this hypothesis, especially given prior findings.

To reduce the risk or slow the progression of nephropathy, optimize blood pressure control. (A)

Screening

Perform an annual test to assess urine albumin excretion (UAE) in type 1 diabetic patients with diabetes duration of ≥ 5 years and in all type 2 diabetic patients, starting at diagnosis. (E)
Measure serum creatinine at least annually in all adults with diabetes regardless of the degree of UAE. The serum creatinine should be used to estimate GFR and stage the level of chronic kidney disease (CKD), if present. (E)

Treatment

In the treatment of the nonpregnant patient with micro- or macroalbuminuria, either ACE inhibitors or ARBs should be used. (A)

(A) In patients with type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and microalbuminuria, both ACE inhibitors and ARBs have been shown to delay the progression to macroalbuminuria. (A) In patients with type 2 diabetes, hypertension, macroalbuminuria, and renal insufficiency (serum creatinine > 1.5 mg/dl), ARBs have been shown to delay the progression of nephropathy. (A) If one class is not tolerated, the other should be substituted. (E)
Reduction of protein intake to 0.8–1.0 g · kg body wt −1 · day −1 in individuals with diabetes and the earlier stages of CKD and to 0.8 g · kg body wt −1 · day −1 in the later stages of CKD may improve measures of renal function (UAE rate, GFR) and is recommended (B)
When ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or diuretics are used, monitor serum creatinine and potassium levels for the development of acute kidney disease and hyperkalemia. (E)
Continued monitoring of UAE to assess both response to therapy and progression of disease is recommended. (E)
Consider referral to a physician experienced in the care of kidney disease when there is uncertainty about the etiology of kidney disease (active urine sediment, absence of retinopathy, rapid decline in GFR), difficult management issues, or advanced kidney disease. (B)

RECOMMENDATIONS RELEVANT TO THE DIAGNOSIS OF HYPERTENSION-MEDIATED KIDNEY DAMAGE AND OTHER DIAGNOSTIC CONSIDERATIONS

The 2023 ESH Guidelines list assessment of serum creatinine (SCr), estimation of glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) with the 2009 CKD-Epidemiology Collaboration formula and evaluation of urine albumin:creatinine ratio (ACR) measured from a spot urine sample (preferably early morning urine) as two of the three (the third being 12-lead electrocardiogram) basic tests to assess HMOD and stage hypertension. These examinations should be documented in all patients upon hypertension diagnosis, and at least annually thereafter. Serum creatinine alone is identified as an insensitive marker of renal impairment, because a major reduction in kidney function can occur before SCr rises. It is also suggested that a negative urinary dipstick test does not rule out A2 albuminuria, as many times it cannot detect ACR levels at the lower range, but it can offer information on other signs of kidney injury (i.e. microscopic hematuria, active urine sediment) and should be performed at least at the initial evaluation. The document endorses the currently universally used definition for CKD, involving an eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 at any level of albuminuria or an ACR > 30 mg/g at any levels of eGFR persisting for more than 3 months, and the current nomenclature for albuminuria, to highlight the risk associated to albuminuria increase, i.e. (i) normal/mildly increased, ACR < 30 mg/g (A1, formerly termed normoalbuminuria); (ii) moderately increased, ACR 30–300 mg/g (A2, formerly termed microalbuminuria); and (iii) severely increased, ACR > 300 mg/g (A3, formerly termed macroalbuminuria).

### KDOQI clinical practice guidelines and clinical practice recommendations for diabetes and chronic kidney disease [^112FeZxZ]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2007). Medium credibility.

KDOQI — screening and diagnostic approach to diabetic kidney disease (DKD) emphasizes albuminuria-based detection and limitations of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). DKD refers to kidney disease that is specific to diabetes, and diagnosis is based in part on elevated urinary albumin excretion divided into microalbuminuria and macroalbuminuria; most professional societies concerned with diabetes and kidney disease now advocate screening for microalbuminuria in patients with diabetes. Screening should begin 5 years after diagnosis of type 1 diabetes and at the time of diagnosis of type 2 diabetes; evidence for the usefulness of eGFR alone as a screening test is less secure, and markers of kidney damage are required to detect early stages because eGFR alone can only detect CKD stage 3 or worse. Because coincidence with other nondiabetic CKD is relatively frequent, evaluation of a person with atypical features should, in selected cases, include additional diagnostic testing, and care should be used in determining tests because radiographic contrast may pose greater risks in people with diabetes and CKD than in others.

Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk assessment — sequential steps identify very high–risk or high–risk conditions, count major ASCVD risk factors, and use risk scoring to categorize patients. Very high risk includes ASCVD and diabetes mellitus with ≥ 2 other major ASCVD risk factors or end-organ damage; high risk includes diabetes mellitus with 0–1 other major ASCVD risk factors, chronic kidney disease stage 3B or 4, and LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL. If 0–1 major risk factors and no other major indicators of higher risk are present, assign to low-risk; if ≥ 3 major risk factors are present, assign to high-risk. If there are 2 major risk factors, risk scoring should be considered; if quantitative risk scoring reaches the high-risk threshold, assign to high-risk; other risk indicators from additional testing can support high-risk; otherwise assign to moderate-risk. Further risk assessment is not required after identifying the highest applicable risk level. The high–risk threshold is defined as ≥ 10% using Adult Treatment Panel III Framingham Risk Score for hard coronary heart disease, ≥ 15% using the 2013 Pooled Cohort Equations for hard ASCVD, or ≥ 45% using the Framingham long–term CVD risk calculation. End-organ damage is indicated by increased albumin-to-creatinine ratio (≥ 30 mg/g), chronic kidney disease with eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m^2, or retinopathy. For CKD stage 3B (eGFR 30–44 mL/min/1.73 m^2) or stage 4 (eGFR 15–29 mL/min/1.73 m^2), risk calculators should not be used; stage 5 CKD is a very high–risk condition and no treatment goals for lipid therapy have been defined for stage 5 CKD.

### Use of albumin creatinine ratio and urine albumin concentration as a screening test for albuminuria in an indo-Asian population [^11694dRn]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Albuminuria (> 30 mg/day) based on 24 h urine albumin excretion is one of the criteria for chronic kidney disease (CKD) and a predictor of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Differences in urine albumin concentration and creatinine excretion rates between Indo-Asians and other populations may require different threshold values for detection of albuminuria. We compared the use of spot urine albumin concentration and urine albumin to creatinine excretion ratio for detection of albuminuria in this population.

Methods

A total of 577 subjects aged ≥ 40 years, 54% of whom were women, were recruited from the general population in Karachi, Pakistan. Albumin concentration (mg/l) and albumin to creatinine ratio (mg/g of creatinine) were determined in a spot morning urine sample, and albuminuria (30 mg/day or greater) measured in a 24 h urine collected on the subsequent day.

Results

The median (25–75 percentile) of urine albumin excretion was 4.8 (3.6–10.3) mg/day: 5.4 (3.7–12.5) mg/day in men and 4.5 (3.8–8.9) mg/day in women. The overall prevalence (95% CI) of albuminuria was 11.8% (7.2–12.0%): 14.8% in men and 9.2% in women (P = 0.04). The areas under the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves for urine albumin concentration were 0.86 (0.82–0.90) and 0.88 (0.84–0.92), respectively, in women and men. The areas under the ROC curves for albumin to creatinine ratio were 0.86 (0.82–0.89) and 0.90 (0.86–0.93), respectively, in women and men. For urine albumin concentration, the sensitivity and specificity were 37 and 97%, respectively, in women and 69 and 94%, respectively, in men at the conventionally recommended value of 2 mg/dl. The discriminator value of urine albumin concentration identified in the analysis was 0.5 mg/dl in women (sensitivity of 87% and specificity of 75%) and 1.7 mg/dl in men (sensitivity of 74% and specificity of 93%). For the albumin to creatinine ratio, the sensitivity and specificity were 46 and 95%, respectively, in women and 60 and 97%, respectively, in men at cut-off value of 30 mg/g.

Conclusion

Both urine albumin concentration and albumin to creatinine ratio are acceptable tests for population screening for albuminuria in Indo-Asians. While sensitivities may be suboptimal, particularly in women, lowering the existing thresholds would compromise specificity. Those who screen positive need evaluation and management of CKD and prevention of CVD.

B. Prognosis.

Albuminuria values > 30 mg/g creatinine [and lower values if the eGFR is < 60 mL/min (Table 8)] have prognostic significance. Multiple epidemiologic studies have shown it to be an independent risk marker for cardiovascular death. In 80% of patients with type 1 diabetes and low levels of albuminuria, urinary albumin excretion can increase by as much as 10%–20%/year, with the development of clinical proteinuria (> 300 mg albumin/day) in 10–15 years in more than half the patients. After clinical-grade proteinuria occurs, > 90% of patients develop a decreased GFR and, ultimately, end-stage renal disease. In type 2 diabetes, 20%–40% of patients with stage A2 albuminuria (Table 8) progress to overt nephropathy, but by 20 years after overt nephropathy, approximately 20% develop end-stage renal disease. In addition, patients with diabetes (type 1 or type 2) and stage A2 albuminuria are at increased risk for cardiovascular disease. Of note is that low levels of albuminuria alone indicate neither an increased risk for progression to end-stage kidney disease nor kidney disease per se; hypertension needs to be present for the risk of progression. Moreover, about 20% of people progress to end-stage kidney disease without an increase in low levels of albuminuria. Another factor that indicates progression is an increase in albuminuria from stage A2 to A3 over time despite achievement of blood pressure goals.

C. Monitoring.

The roles of routine urinalysis and albumin measurements are less clear in patients with stage A2 albuminuria. Some experts have advocated urine protein testing to monitor treatment, which may include improved glycemic control, more assiduous control of hypertension, dietary protein restriction, and therapy with blockers of the renin angiotensin system. Several factors are known to slow the rate of urinary albumin excretion or to prevent its development. They include reducing blood pressure (with a blocker of the renin angiotensin system as part of the regimen), glycemic control, and lipid-lowering therapy (,–).

Assess albuminuria and GFR more often for individuals at higher risk of CKD progression when measurement will impact therapeutic decisions. For people with CKD, a change in eGFR of > 20% on a subsequent test exceeds the expected variability and warrants evaluation. Among people with CKD who initiate hemodynamically active therapies, GFR reductions of > 30% on subsequent testing exceed the expected variability and warrant evaluation. For albuminuria monitoring of people with CKD, a doubling of the ACR on a subsequent test exceeds laboratory variability and warrants evaluation.

We recommend using urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio and estimated glomerular filtration rate for predicting chronic kidney disease progression. In patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate < 60 mL/minute/1.73 m^2, we suggest estimating glomerular filtration rate with a combined creatinine and cystatin C formula for risk prediction. We suggest the use of a validated end-stage kidney disease risk prediction model (e.g., kidney failure risk equation [KFRE]) for the management of stage G3-G5 chronic kidney disease. When providing patient education about chronic kidney disease, there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against any specific health education program or mode of delivery.

### Urine albumin / creatinine ratio below 30 mg / g is a predictor of incident hypertension and cardiovascular mortality [^1168QNvo]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Chronic kidney disease is a costly disease, and the costs associated with the care of patients with end‐stage renal disease are estimated to exceed US$1 trillion globally. 1 Albuminuria or microalbuminuria, albumin excretion rate ≥ 30 mg/24 hours or albumin/creatinine ratio (ACR) ≥ 30 mg/g (≥ 3 mg/mmol), is used as a marker of renal damage and is used to define chronic kidney disease along with low estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). 2 Albuminuria is not only a predictor of development and progression of diabetic 3 and nondiabetic 4 renal diseases, but is a marker of endothelial dysfunction. 5 In 1969, Keen and colleagues first showed that increased urinary albumin excretion (microalbuminuria) occurred in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus compared with controls during an oral glucose tolerance test. 6

A recent meta‐analysis based on more than 100 000 individuals with ACR data and 1.1 million participants with dipstick data from 21 general population cohorts demonstrated that albuminuria was associated with all‐cause and cardiovascular mortality independently of each other and traditional cardiovascular risk factors. 7 These data from 21 studies from 14 countries of Asia, Europe, North America, and Oceania showed consistency in both continuous and categorical models for ACR across the different regional cohorts.

Both cardiovascular disease (CVD) and diabetes mellitus share many risk factors in common (the "common soil" hypothesis 8), but whether urine albumin:creatinine ratio (UACR) below 30 mg/g similarly predicts mortality outcomes, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus in the same population is uncertain. It is well established that microalbuminuria is associated with all‐cause and cardiovascular mortality, and microalbuminuria is associated with diabetes mellitus 9 and resistant hypertension. 10 However, although it has been shown that urinary albumin excretion predicts blood pressure progression in people without diabetes mellitus or hypertension, at levels of UACR below 30 mg/g, 9 it is less certain whether these levels are associated with CVD mortality, and increased risk of incident hypertension and incident diabetes mellitus.

The aim of the study was to test the hypothesis that UACR below 30 mg/g was associated with the following outcomes: incident hypertension, incident diabetes mellitus, and all‐cause and CVD mortality during a maximum of 11 years of follow‐up, in a middle‐aged relatively healthy occupational cohort with exclusion of those with UACR > 30 mg/g.

### Normality data of eGFR and validity of commonly used screening tests for CKD in an area with endemic CKD of unknown etiology; need for age and sex based precise cutoff values [^116ULFt3]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Screening of high risk people for CKD has been a standard practice worldwide. There is no uniform screening method to be applied to detect CKD patients with all different aetiologies. Urine protein analysis or serum creatinine estimation or combination of these two has been used to detect CKD in diabetes and hypertensive patients. Commonly used screening tests for abnormal protein excretion in urine includes urine sulfosalicylic acid test (SSA Test), urine dipstick test, urine albumin to creatinine ratio (UACR) and urine protein to creatinine ratio (UPCR). Urine SSA tests and dipstick analysis is used in most outpatient settings for semi quantitative measurement of urine protein concentration. UPCR and UACR measure protein excretion quantitatively and can be done on a spot urine sample. An elevated UACR (or albuminuria) is the most widely used marker for identifying kidney damage, as it is highly sensitive in the earlier stages of traditional CKD. Persistent microalbuninuria has been used to detect early CKD in diabetes and hypertensive patients. However, urine protein or microalbumin analysis may not be effective in screening of patients with CKDu.

Our study was designed to estimate the baseline eGFR values of apparently health population living in the area with highest reported prevalence of CKDu in Sri Lanka using different estimation methods and also to compare the test characteristics of different methods of proteinuria/albuminuria estimations as valid field tests.

### Developments in albuminuria testing: a key biomarker for detection, prognosis and surveillance of kidney and cardiovascular disease – A practical update for clinicians [^115ue12H]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

A random spot urine sample, collected at any time of the day, is a convenient and minimally burdensome option for clinical practice. However, its results are subject to variability due to factors such as posture, physical activity and dietary protein intake. A first‐morning void, collected immediately upon waking, minimises variability from these factors, making it the preferred method for diagnosing and monitoring albuminuria. This method has a strong correlation with 24‐h albumin excretion and exhibits low intraindividual variability. However, implementation may be challenging, as nephrology offices must provide containers and instructions for home collection. As a practical alternative, early‐morning voids, collected shortly after waking, are acceptable, though they exhibit slightly greater variability.

Urinary albumin concentration can be measured from these samples; however, it varies within individuals due to fluctuations in urine concentration and dilution over time. Since creatinine is excreted at a relatively constant rate per unit of time, it serves as a normalising factor, allowing adjustments for urine tonicity and reducing intraindividual variability. Albumin‐to‐creatinine ratio (ACR) measurement eliminates the need for timed collections, including 24‐h samples, making ACR a practical alternative for assessing urinary albumin excretion.

Hypertension evaluation — at initial diagnosis, the ACC/AHA guideline recommends basic laboratory testing (complete blood count; serum sodium, potassium, and calcium; fasting blood glucose; lipid profile; thyroid-stimulating hormone) and an electrocardiogram to profile CVD risk and establish baseline characteristics; it also recommends serum creatinine to calculate estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and assessment of albuminuria with urine dipstick, with optional echocardiogram, serum uric acid, and quantification of urine albumin–creatinine ratio (UACR). The KDOQI commentary states "we recommend screening with a UACR measurement instead of urine dipstick, a less sensitive test".

### Developments in albuminuria testing: a key biomarker for detection, prognosis and surveillance of kidney and cardiovascular disease – A practical update for clinicians [^112mxsCD]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

The term microalbuminuria was introduced in 1981 by Viberti, Parving and Svendsen and colleaguesto describe urinary albumin excretion levels below the detection threshold of standard dipstick tests but predictive of progression to overt proteinuria, particularly in patients with diabetes. Initially defined as a urinary albumin excretion of 20–200 μg/min or 30–300 mg/24 h, it quickly gained recognition as a critical prognostic marker. Although microalbuminuria was widely accepted as a risk marker for kidney and cardiovascular outcomes in patients with or without diabetes, the term has since been abandoned due to its misleading implication that small or abnormal albumin molecules were being excreted in urine, as well as the potential for misinterpreting microalbuminuria as clinically insignificant. Furthermore, emerging evidence demonstrated that any detectable albuminuria, even within 'normal' ranges, is associated with an increased risk of kidney and cardiovascular outcomes, highlighting a continuous relationship between albuminuria levels and adverse outcomes. This pattern parallels findings in blood pressure, where even high‐normal levels (a systolic blood pressure between 120 and 130 mHg) are associated with elevated risk. Advances in the understanding of albumin heterogeneity, including the presence of albumin fragments and modified forms in urine, further challenged the validity of the term. Consequently, microalbuminuria has been removed from clinical and laboratory nomenclature and replaced by standardised, more quantitative terms, such as moderately and severely increased albuminuria.

Kidney assessment in hypertension — hypertension is highlighted as "the second most important cause of CKD after diabetes". Antihypertensive therapy can transiently affect creatinine: "BP reduction by antihypertensive treatment often leads to an acute increase in serum creatinine by as much as 20–30%, especially with renin–angiotensin system (RAS) blockers", and CKD classification uses eGFR: "CKD is classified according to estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), calculated by the 2009 CKD-Epidemiology Collaboration formula". Albuminuria assessment is specified: "The albumin:creatinine ratio (ACR) is measured from a spot urine sample (preferably early morning urine), and is the preferred method to quantify urinary albumin excretion". Monitoring is advised: "Serum creatinine, eGFR, and ACR should be documented in all hypertensive patients, and if CKD is diagnosed, repeated at least annually", and urinalysis caveat: "One negative urinary dipstick test does not rule out albuminuria, in contrast to a normal ACR".

### Day-to-day variability in spot urine albumin-creatinine ratio [^11631Lyn]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Accurate quantification of albuminuria is important in the diagnosis and management of chronic kidney disease. The reference test, a timed urinary albumin excretion, is cumbersome and prone to collection errors. Spot urine albumin-creatinine ratio (ACR) is convenient and commonly used, but random day-to-day variability in ACR measurements has not been assessed.

Study Design

Prospective cohort study of day-to-day variability in spot urine ACR measurements.

Setting & Participants

Clinically stable outpatients (N = 157) attending a university hospital clinic in Australia between July 2007 and April 2010.

Outcomes

Spot urine ACR variability was assessed and repeatability limits were determined using fractional polynomials.

Measurements

ACRs were measured from spot urine samples collected at 9:00am on consecutive days and 24-hour urine albuminuria was measured concurrently.

Results

Paired ACRs were obtained from 157 patients (median age, 56 years; 60% men; median daily albumin excretion, 226 [range, 2.5–14,000] mg/d). Day-to-day variability was substantial and increased in absolute terms, but decreased in relative terms, with increasing baseline ACR. For patients with normoalbuminuria (ACR < 3 mg/mmol [< 27 mg/g]), a change greater than ± 467% (0–17 mg/mmol [0–150 mg/g]) is required to indicate a significant change in albuminuria status with 95% certainty; for those with microalbuminuria (ACR of 3–30 mg/mmol [27–265 mg/g]), a change of ± 170% (0–27 mg/mmol [0–239 mg/g]) is required; for those with macroalbuminuria (ACR > 30 mg/mmol [> 265 mg/g]), a change of ± 83% (5–55 mg/mmol [44–486 mg/g]) is required; and for those with nephrotic-range proteinuria (ACR > 300 mg/mmol [> 2,652 mg/g]), a change of ± 48% (158–443 mg/mmol [1,397–3,916 mg/g]) is needed to represent a significant change.

Limitations

These study results need to be replicated in other ethnic groups.

Conclusions

Changes in chronic kidney disease status attributed to therapy or disease progression, when based solely on a change in ACR, may be incorrect unless the potential for day-to-day biological variation has been considered. Only relatively large changes are likely to indicate a change in disease status.

### Albumin-to-creatinine ratio for detection of… [^116BDTXA]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

A challenge to periodic screening for microalbuminuria is that 24-hour urine collections are cumbersome, possibly contributing to noncompliance. Bakker compared the reliability of 24-hour collection versus the urinary albumin concentration and the albumin-to-creatinine ratio in detecting microalbuminuria. A total of 2, 394 consecutive urine samples from 1, 171 men and 1, 223 women with diabetes were evaluated over a period of two-and-one-half years. Standard methods were used to determine the total albumin excretion rate, the urinary albumin concentration and the albumin-to-creatinine ratio. On the basis of the albumin excretion rate, the frequency of microalbuminuria in this population was 36. 6 percent in the men and
27. 9 percent in the women. The frequency of microalbuminuria increased steadily after the age of 50 years. The correlation between the albumin excretion rate and the albumin concentration was considered "acceptable" and did not show sex-related differences.

However, there was a closer correlation between 24-hour collection values and the albumin-to-creatinine ratio. The correlation improved for men and women when they were considered separately. An albumin excretion rate of 20 μg per minute corresponded to an albumin-to-creatinine ratio of 1. 98 g per mol for men and
2. 81 g per mol for women. An albumin excretion rate of 200 μg per minute corresponded with an albumin-to-creatinine ratio of 19 g per mol for men and 28 g per mol for women. The author concludes that the albumin-to-creatinine ratio may be used in place of the more cumbersome 24-hour urine collection for the detection of microalbminuria. The sensitivity and specificity of the albumin-to-creatinine ratio were 94 percent and 92 percent, respectively, at 2. 5 g per mol for women, and 94 percent and 93 percent, respectively, at
1. 8 g per mol for men.

In contrast to the urinary albumin concentration, however, the albumin-to-creatinine ratio requires both sex- and age-specific discriminator values.

### NHANES 2011–2012: albumin&creatinine-urine data documentation, codebook, and frequencies… [^116bSHNU]. wwwn.cdc.gov (2011). Low credibility.

Urinary albumin and urinary creatinine are measured in a random urine sample collected in the MEC and a first morning void urine sample collected by the participant at home. Urine albumin-creatinine ratio is used to classify stages of chronic kidney disease. In addition, the urine creatinine is used to standardize the collection of urine analytes such as environmental chemicals. Increased microalbuminuria is a sign of renal disease and may be predictive of nephropathy risk in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes. Various large cohort studies have shown that microalbuminuria is a strong risk predictor for cardiovascular morbidity and all-cause mortality. Because urinary albumin excretion follows a circadian rhythm, the preferred method to collect urine for albumin assessment is to collect a 24 hour urine specimen. However, a 24-hour urine collection is inconvenient to obtain in NHANES for logistical reasons.

Therefore, measurement of urinary albumin and creatinine concentrations are performed and an albumin: creatinine ratio was determined from both a random urine and a first morning void. The data were reviewed. Incomplete data or improbable values were sent to the performing laboratory for confirmation. Two calculated variables, URDACT and URDACT2, were created in this data file: The random urine albumin in ug/mL and urine creatinine in mg/dL were converted to the albumin/creatinine ratio in mg/g.: URDACT = URXUMA/URXUCR x 100, round to. 01 The morning void urine albumin in ug/mL and second urine creatinine in mg/dL were converted to the second albumin/creatinine ratio in mg/g:

The random urine sample has a higher mean ACR compared with the mean of the first-morning void urine because of factors such as orthostatic proteinuria and exercise. For participants 20 years and older in NHANES 2009–2010, the weighted mean random ACR was 23. 7 mg/g and the mean first-morning void ACR was
15. 9 mg/g.

Therefore, measurement of urinary albumin and creatinine concentrations are performed and an albumin: creatinine ratio was determined from both a random urine and a first morning void. The random urine albumin in ug/mL and urine creatinine in mg/dL were converted to the albumin/creatinine ratio in mg/g.: URDACT = URXUMA/URXUCR.

The morning void urine albumin in ug/mL and second urine creatinine in mg/dL were converted to the second albumin/creatinine ratio in mg/g: URDACT2 = URXUMA2/URXUCR2. Persistent albuminuria, as measured by the urine albumin-creatinine ratio in two urines from an individual, is used to determine the prevalence of stages 1 and 2 of chronic kidney disease. In NHANES 2009–2010, two urine samples were collected from participants ages 6 years and older. A random urine was initially collected in the NHANES mobile examination center. Participants were then asked to collect a first-morning void urine in their home within 10 days of the MEC examination. The random urine has a higher mean ACR compared with the mean of the first-morning void urine because of factors such as orthostatic proteinuria and exercise.

For participants 20 years and older in NHANES 2009–2010, the weighted mean random ACR was 23. 7 mg/g and the mean first-morning void ACR was
15. 9 mg/g.
