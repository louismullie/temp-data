## Question

Antibiotic coverage for 14 year old with cellulitis with dosing

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about antibiotic coverage and dosing for a 14-year-old with cellulitis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and severity classification. Then, I should verify the likely pathogens and whether MRSA coverage is indicated. Next, I will consider outpatient versus inpatient management and the route of therapy. After that, I need to select empiric agents with appropriate pediatric dosing and duration, including what to do if there is no improvement. Finally, I should review special scenarios, follow-up, and stewardship considerations, and then synthesize a concise recommendation with dosing examples.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and severity. For a 14-year-old, I should classify cellulitis as nonpurulent versus purulent, assess for systemic inflammatory response, and determine whether there are red flags such as immunocompromise, penetrating trauma, animal bite, or concern for necrotizing infection, because these factors drive both route and spectrum of therapy [^955c5117] [^a0f09b3d].

> I need to check the likely pathogens. In adolescents with nonpurulent cellulitis, β-hemolytic streptococci predominate, whereas Staphylococcus aureus is less common unless there is purulence, penetrating trauma, or MRSA risk factors; thus, routine MRSA coverage is not indicated for typical nonpurulent cellulitis in otherwise healthy teens [^955c5117] [^4da44506] [^46aa3366].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about MRSA. I should confirm risk factors that would push me to cover MRSA: purulent drainage or abscess, penetrating trauma, prior MRSA infection or colonization, high local MRSA prevalence, severe infection with systemic toxicity, or failure of initial β-lactam therapy; in those cases, adding MRSA-active therapy is reasonable, but otherwise it is unnecessary and may expose the patient to adverse effects and resistance [^268fb36a] [^8b6bbefb] [^e25acb0a].

> Next, I should review outpatient versus inpatient management. If the patient is hemodynamically stable, without SIRS, altered mental status, or concern for deeper infection, outpatient oral therapy is appropriate; hospitalization is indicated for systemic instability, poor adherence, immunocompromise, failure of outpatient therapy, or concern for necrotizing infection [^19752a51] [^955c5117].

> Let me think about first-line oral therapy for uncomplicated nonpurulent cellulitis. A β-lactam active against streptococci is recommended; cephalexin is a common choice with pediatric dosing of 25–50 mg/kg/day divided every 6 hours, and amoxicillin-clavulanate is an alternative at 25 mg/kg/day of the amoxicillin component divided every 12 hours; I should double-check that these align with IDSA pediatric dosing ranges, which they do [^d3b916cf] [^66470b52] [^47c53745].

> Wait, let me verify duration. I initially thought 7–10 days might be needed, but current guidance supports 5 days for most uncomplicated cases, extending only if there is inadequate clinical response by day 5; this balances efficacy and stewardship, and pediatric QI work has shown safe adoption of 5–7 day courses with sustained low revisit rates [^955c5117] [^5d516976] [^eac81446].

> I should confirm what to do if there is no improvement by 48–72 hours. If erythema, warmth, pain, or systemic symptoms are not improving, I need to reassess for abscess or alternative diagnoses, consider obtaining cultures, and then broaden therapy to include MRSA coverage if risk factors are present or local epidemiology warrants it [^955c5117] [^7fabfe87].

> Now, for purulent cellulitis or when MRSA risk factors are present, I need to ensure appropriate MRSA-active therapy. Oral options include clindamycin 25–40 mg/kg/day divided every 8 hours, TMP-SMX 8–12 mg/kg/day of the TMP component divided every 12 hours plus a β-lactam for streptococcal coverage, or linezolid 600 mg every 12 hours in children 12 years and older; I should confirm that linezolid dosing applies to adolescents, which it does per IDSA MRSA guidance [^4ba3958b] [^039e16f2] [^aa0c7f7d].

> But wait, what if the patient requires IV therapy due to severity or inability to take oral medications. For streptococcal coverage, cefazolin 50 mg/kg/day divided every 8 hours is appropriate; for MRSA coverage, vancomycin 40 mg/kg/day divided every 6–8 hours is standard, with linezolid 600 mg every 12 hours as an alternative in adolescents; I should double-check pediatric vancomycin dosing, which is correctly stated here [^66470b52] [^4ba3958b].

> Let me consider special scenarios. If there is a concern for necrotizing infection, I need to act emergently with surgical consultation and broad-spectrum therapy such as vancomycin plus piperacillin-tazobactam; if there is animal bite, I should cover Pasteurella with amoxicillin-clavulanate and avoid clindamycin monotherapy; if there is Vibrio vulnificus exposure, doxycycline plus a third-generation cephalosporin is recommended in life-threatening situations, recognizing pediatric restrictions and the need to individualize [^5f18ad66] [^901ff5f7] [^c0ce143d] [^eae31084].

> I should confirm follow-up and supportive care. Elevation of the affected limb, meticulous skin care, and treatment of predisposing factors like tinea pedis or edema reduce recurrence; for recurrent cellulitis, consider prophylactic penicillin or macrolides and address modifiable risks; cultures are not routinely needed in uncomplicated cases but should be obtained if there is purulence, severe immunocompromise, or treatment failure [^955c5117] [^becddefb] [^bbf647e6] [^7fabfe87].

> Hold on, I should verify stewardship data so I don't overprescribe. High-quality evidence shows no superiority of MRSA-active regimens over streptococcal-focused therapy in uncomplicated nonpurulent cellulitis, and adding TMP-SMX to cephalexin did not improve outcomes; therefore, I should avoid unnecessary MRSA coverage and default to narrow-spectrum streptococcal therapy unless risk factors are present [^0148392e] [^0f35b49d] [^32d460f6].

> Putting this together, my default recommendation for a 14-year-old with uncomplicated nonpurulent cellulitis is outpatient cephalexin 25–50 mg/kg/day divided every 6 hours for 5 days, with reassessment at 48–72 hours; if there is purulence or MRSA risk factors, I would use clindamycin 25–40 mg/kg/day divided every 8 hours or TMP-SMX 8–12 mg/kg/day of the TMP component divided every 12 hours plus amoxicillin or cephalexin for streptococci, or linezolid 600 mg every 12 hours if oral and adolescent-appropriate; if IV therapy is needed, cefazolin 50 mg/kg/day divided every 8 hours for streptococci or vancomycin 40 mg/kg/day divided every 6–8 hours for MRSA are appropriate, with duration individualized to response but often 5–7 days total when improving [^d3b916cf] [^66470b52] [^4ba3958b] [^955c5117].

---

For a 14-year-old with cellulitis, **empiric therapy should target streptococci** [^955c5117] as the most common cause, with MRSA coverage only if risk factors are present [^4da44506] [^8b6bbefb]. For uncomplicated cases, use **oral cephalexin 25–50 mg/kg/day divided Q6H** [^66470b52] for 5–7 days [^5d516976]; if MRSA is suspected, add clindamycin 25–40 mg/kg/day divided Q8H or TMP-SMX 8–12 mg/kg/day of the TMP component divided BID, plus a beta-lactam for streptococci [^4ba3958b] [^aa0c7f7d]. For severe infection or systemic toxicity, use IV cefazolin 50 mg/kg/dose Q8H or vancomycin 15–20 mg/kg/dose Q8–12H [^66470b52] [^8528b5a5]; switch to oral therapy when stable, total 7–10 days [^a90fb55d]. Adjust dosing for renal function and local resistance patterns [^notfound].

---

## Common pathogens and empiric coverage

- **Streptococci**: Most common in nonpurulent cellulitis; beta-lactams are first-line [^955c5117] [^46aa3366].
- **Staphylococcus aureus**: Consider MSSA coverage if purulent or severe; add MRSA coverage only if risk factors are present [^4da44506] [^8b6bbefb].
- **MRSA**: Add coverage if prior MRSA, penetrating trauma, high local prevalence, or severe infection [^268fb36a] [^e25acb0a].

---

## Recommended empiric antibiotic regimens and dosing

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended regimen** | **Dosing** |
|-|-|-|
| Uncomplicated, nonpurulent cellulitis | Cephalexin (first-generation cephalosporin) | 25–50 mg/kg/day divided Q6H (max 2 g/day) [^66470b52] [^c8f2d0ac] |
| MRSA risk factors present | Clindamycin (covers MRSA and streptococci) | 25–40 mg/kg/day divided Q8H (max 1.8 g/day) [^4ba3958b] [^66470b52] |
| Beta-lactam allergy | Clindamycin | 25–40 mg/kg/day divided Q8H (max 1.8 g/day) [^4ba3958b] [^66470b52] |
| Severe infection or systemic toxicity | Cefazolin (IV) | 50 mg/kg/dose Q8H (max 2 g/dose) [^66470b52] |
| MRSA coverage required (severe) | Vancomycin (IV) | 15–20 mg/kg/dose Q8–12H (max 2 g/dose) [^8528b5a5] [^4ba3958b] |

---

## Duration of therapy

Standard duration is **5–7 days** for uncomplicated cellulitis [^5d516976]; extend to 7–10 days if severe, slow response, or immunocompromised [^a90fb55d] [^0df62207].

---

## Clinical response and follow-up

Assess at **48–72 hours**; if no improvement, reassess for abscess, alternative diagnoses, or resistant organisms, and adjust therapy accordingly [^955c5117] [^7fabfe87].

---

## Special considerations

- **Renal impairment**: Adjust dosing for renally cleared agents (e.g. vancomycin, cephalexin) [^notfound].
- **Local resistance patterns**: Tailor empiric therapy to local antibiograms [^da2106c7].
- **Patient-specific factors**: Consider allergies, comorbidities, and adherence [^1ed1f8ef].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Uncomplicated cellulitis**: Cephalexin 25–50 mg/kg/day divided Q6H for 5–7 days [^66470b52] [^5d516976].
- **MRSA risk**: Add clindamycin or TMP-SMX plus a beta-lactam for streptococci [^4ba3958b] [^aa0c7f7d].
- **Severe infection**: IV cefazolin or vancomycin; switch to oral when stable, total 7–10 days [^66470b52] [^a90fb55d].
- **Follow-up**: Reassess at 48–72 hours; modify therapy if no improvement [^955c5117].

---

Empiric therapy for a 14-year-old with cellulitis should prioritize **streptococcal coverage** [^955c5117], adding MRSA therapy only when risk factors are present [^4da44506]. Cephalexin is first-line for uncomplicated cases [^d3b916cf]; clindamycin or TMP-SMX plus a beta-lactam are used when MRSA is suspected [^aa0c7f7d]. IV cefazolin or vancomycin is reserved for severe disease, with step-down to oral therapy when stable [^a90fb55d].

### Assessment of antibiotic treatment of cellulitis and erysipelas: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^0f35b49d]. JAMA Dermatology (2019). High credibility.

Importance

The optimum antibiotic treatment for cellulitis and erysipelas lacks consensus. The available trial data do not demonstrate the superiority of any agent, and data are limited on the most appropriate route of administration or duration of therapy.

Objective

To assess the efficacy and safety of antibiotic therapy for non-surgically acquired cellulitis.

Data Sources

The following databases were searched to June 28, 2016: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (2016, issue 5), Medline (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), and Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Information System (LILACS) (from 1982). In addition, 5 trials databases and the reference lists of included studies were searched. Further searches of PubMed and Google Scholar were undertaken from June 28, 2016, to December 31, 2018.

Study Selection

Randomized clinical trials comparing different antibiotics, routes of administration, and treatment durations were included.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

For data collection and analysis, the standard methodological procedures of the Cochrane Collaboration were used. For dichotomous outcomes, the risk ratio and its 95% CI were calculated. A summary of findings table was created for the primary end points, adopting the GRADE approach to assess the quality of the evidence.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was the proportion of patients cured, improved, recovered, or symptom-free or symptom-reduced at the end of treatment, as reported by the trial. The secondary outcome was any adverse event.

Results

A total of 43 studies with a total of 5999 evaluable participants, whose age ranged from 1 month to 96 years, were included. Cellulitis was the primary diagnosis in only 15 studies (35%), and in other studies the median(interquartile range) proportion of patients with cellulitis was 29.7% (22.9%-50.3%). Overall, no evidence was found to support the superiority of any 1 antibiotic over another, and antibiotics with activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus did not add an advantage. Use of intravenous antibiotics over oral antibiotics and treatment duration of longer than 5 days were not supported by evidence.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, only low-quality evidence was found for the most appropriate agent, route of administration, and duration of treatment for patients with cellulitis; future trials need to use a standardized set of outcomes, including severity scoring, dosing, and duration of therapy.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^d3b916cf]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Cellulitis treatment — antibiotic selection and duration — states that therapy for typical cases should include an antibiotic active against streptococci; many patients can start oral therapy, and suitable options include penicillin, amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, dicloxacillin, cephalexin, or clindamycin. In uncomplicated cellulitis, a 5-day course of antimicrobial therapy is as effective as a 10-day course if clinical improvement has occurred by 5 days; in hospitalized cellulitis/abscess, the average duration was 2 weeks, only about one-third received specific gram-positive therapy, two-thirds received very-broad-spectrum treatment, and the failure rate of 12% was not different regardless of spectrum of treatment.

### Clinical trial: comparative effectiveness of cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole versus cephalexin alone for treatment of uncomplicated cellulitis: a randomized controlled trial [^7ab94428]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Community-associated methicillin-resistant S. aureus (CA-MRSA) is the most common organism isolated from purulent skin infections. Antibiotics are usually not beneficial for skin abscess, and national guidelines do not recommend CA-MRSA coverage for cellulitis, except purulent cellulitis, which is uncommon. Despite this, antibiotics targeting CA-MRSA are prescribed commonly and increasingly for skin infections, perhaps due, in part, to lack of experimental evidence among cellulitis patients. We test the hypothesis that antibiotics targeting CA-MRSA are beneficial in the treatment of cellulitis.

Methods

We performed a randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial from 2007 to 2011. We enrolled patients with cellulitis, no abscesses, symptoms for < 1 week, and no diabetes, immunosuppression, peripheral vascular disease, or hospitalization (clinicaltrials.gov NCT00676130). All participants received cephalexin. Additionally, each was randomized to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or placebo. We provided 14 days of antibiotics and instructed participants to continue therapy for ≥ 1 week, then stop 3 days after they felt the infection to be cured. Our main outcome measure was the risk difference for treatment success, determined in person at 2 weeks, with telephone and medical record confirmation at 1 month.

Results

We enrolled 153 participants, and 146 had outcome data for intent-to-treat analysis. Median age was 29, range 3–74. Of intervention participants, 62/73 (85%) were cured versus 60/73 controls (82%), a risk difference of 2.7% (95% confidence interval, -9.3% to 15%; P = 0.66). No covariates predicted treatment response, including nasal MRSA colonization and purulence at enrollment.

Conclusions

Among patients diagnosed with cellulitis without abscess, the addition of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole to cephalexin did not improve outcomes overall or by subgroup.

Clinical Trials Registration

NCT00676130.

Management of common infections and optimal use of antimicrobial agents are presented, highlighting new evidence from the medical literature that enlightens practice. Primary therapy of staphylococcal skin abscesses is drainage. Patients who have a large abscess (> 5 cm), cellulitis or mixed abscess-cellulitis likely would benefit from additional antibiotic therapy. When choosing an antibiotic for outpatient management, the patient, pathogen and in vitro drug susceptibility as well as tolerability, bioavailability and safety characteristics of antibiotics should be considered. Management of recurrent staphylococcal skin and soft tissue infections is vexing. Focus is best placed on reducing density of the organism on the patient's skin and in the environment, and optimizing a healthy skin barrier. With attention to adherence and optimal dosing, acute uncomplicated osteomyelitis can be managed with early transition from parenteral to oral therapy and with a 3–4 week total course of therapy. Doxycycline should be prescribed when indicated for a child of any age. Its use is not associated with dental staining. Azithromycin should be prescribed for infants when indicated, whilst being alert to an associated ≥ 2-fold excess risk of pyloric stenosis with use under 6 weeks of age. Beyond the neonatal period, acyclovir is more safely dosed by body surface area (not to exceed 500 mg/m²/dose) than by weight. In addition to the concern of antimicrobial resistance, unnecessary use of antibiotics should be avoided because of potential later metabolic effects, thought to be due to perturbation of the host's microbiome.

### Route and duration of antibiotic therapy in acute cellulitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis of the effectiveness and harms of antibiotic treatment [^418fd95e]. The Journal of Infection (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Compared with guideline recommendations, antibiotic overuse is common in treating cellulitis. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analyses on antibiotic route and duration of treatment for cellulitis in adults and children.

Methods

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE and trial registries from inception to Dec 11, 2019 for interventional and observational studies of antibiotic treatment for cellulitis. Exclusions included case series/reports, pre-septal/orbital cellulitis and non-English language articles. Random-effects meta-analyses were used to produce summary relative risk (RR) estimates for our primary outcome of clinical response.

Prospero

CRD42018100602.

Results

We included 47/8423 articles, incorporating data from eleven trials (1855 patients) in two meta-analyses. The overall risk of bias was moderate. Only two trials compared the same antibiotic agent in each group. We found no evidence of difference in clinical response rates for antibiotic route or duration (RR(oral:IV) = 1.12, 95%CI 0.98–1.27, I² = 32% and RR(shorter:longer) = 0.99, 95%CI 0•96–1.03, I² = 0%, respectively). Findings were consistent in observational studies. Follow-up data beyond 30 days were sparse.

Conclusions

The evidence base for antibiotic treatment decisions in cellulitis is flawed by biased comparisons, short follow-up and lack of data around harms of antibiotic overuse. Future research should focus on developing patient-tailored antibiotic prescribing for cellulitis to reduce unnecessary antibiotic use.

### Aligning provider prescribing with guidelines for soft tissue infections [^5bb15ad4]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

Despite evidence-based guidelines, antibiotics prescribed for uncomplicated skin and soft tissue infections can involve inappropriate microbial coverage. Our aim was to evaluate the appropriateness of antibiotic prescribing practices for mild nonpurulent cellulitis in a pediatric tertiary academic medical center over a 1-year period.

Methods

Eligible patients treated in the emergency department or urgent care settings for mild nonpurulent cellulitis from January 2017 to December 2017 were identified by an International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, code for cellulitis. The primary outcome was appropriateness of prescribed antibiotics as delineated by adherence with the Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines. Secondary outcomes include reutilization rate as defined by revisit to the emergency department/urgent cares within 14 days of the initial encounter.

Results

A total of 967 encounters were evaluated with 60.0% overall having guideline-adherent care. Common reasons for nonadherence included inappropriate coverage of MRSA with clindamycin (n = 217, 56.1%) and single-agent coverage with sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (n = 129, 33.3%). There were 29 revisits within 14 days of initial patient encounters or a reutilization rate of 3.0%, which was not significantly associated with the Infectious Diseases Society of America adherence.

Conclusions

Our data show antibiotic prescription for nonpurulent cellulitis as a potential area of standardization and optimization of care at our center.

### Improving duration of antibiotics for skin and soft-tissue infections in pediatric urgent cares… [^5d516976]. publications.aap.org (2022). Medium credibility.

National guidelines recommend a 5- to 7-day course of antibiotics for most skin and soft-tissue infections. Our aim was to increase the percentage of pediatric patients receiving 5 to 7 days of oral antibiotics for SSTIs in our pediatric urgent care clinics from 60% to 75% by December 31, 2021. PDSA cycle 3 provided project outcome and balancing measure updates to UCC providers at regular intervals. We created a monthly report of patients 90 days and older in UCCs with a final diagnosis of SSTIs. We used a Shewhart control chart to identify special cause variations. After completing our PDSA cycles, we found that the percentage of children receiving 5 to 7 days of oral antibiotics for SSTIs exceeded 85%. The improvement was sustained over multiple months. There was no increase in the proportion of patients returning to the UCCs with an SSTI diagnosis within 14 days.

5–7 Skin and soft-tissue infections are the second most common diagnosis leading to pediatric antibiotic prescriptions in the outpatient setting, making them an important target for AS programs. 8 Although multiple studies support a short antibiotic course for SSTIs, 9–11 and the Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines recommend 5 to 7 days of oral antibiotics for common SSTIs, including impetigo, cellulitis, erysipelas, and abscesses 11, 12; more than 75% of patients receive an inappropriately long course of antibiotics. 3, 13 In fact, studies on cellulitis suggest that approximately 93% of pediatric patients receive > 5 days of antibiotics. 3 AS efforts targeting pediatric SSTIs in the urgent care settings are still lacking. Our aim was to increase the percentage of patients receiving 5 to 7 days of oral antibiotics in our pediatric UCCs for SSTIs from 60% to 75% by December 31, 2021.

Discussion We used QI methodology to increase the percentage of patients receiving 5 to 7 days of oral antibiotics for SSTIs in our pediatric UCCs from a baseline of 60% to 86%. We saw a narrowing of the control limits, implying less variability in the prescribing process. We sustained this improvement over multiple months, with no identified increase in returns to UCCs because of treatment failures.

### Ten golden rules for optimal antibiotic use in hospital settings: the WARNING call to action [^873bd4c2]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Antibiotic therapy of up to 21 days for VAP and hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) was used historically until several prospective studies demonstrated the effectiveness of shorter (7–8 days) therapy with no differences in mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) stay, mechanical ventilation-free days or organ failure-free days. The 2017 European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID) guidelines and the 2016 IDSA guidelines both recommend 7 days of therapy for HAP/VAP. Ongoing studies are determining if therapy duration could be reduced further.

Bacteremia caused by Enterobacterales has been treated traditionally with 2 weeks of antibiotics. Recent RCTs and meta-analyses investigating shorter (7–8 days) versus longer antibiotic courses (14–15 days) in patients with gram-negative bacteremia (mostly of urinary tract origin) demonstrate non-inferiority. Regarding acute uncomplicated cellulitis, evidence also suggests that prolonged courses may be unnecessary and that 5 days of treatment may be sufficient. IDSA guidelines recommend a 5-day antibiotic therapy duration for uncomplicated cellulitis, but may be extended if the infection has not improved within that time frame.

Generally, in critically ill patients, decisions about antibiotic therapy duration should be individualized, taking into account patient parameters such as severity of illness, the site and type of infection, whether source control has been achieved, whether PK has been optimized, and clinical response. Procalcitonin (PCT) may be useful to guide antibiotic therapy in the ICU. PCT-guided treatment can reduce the duration of therapy and length of hospital stay in adult critically ill patients with sepsis. Based on apparent benefit and no obvious undesirable effects, the 2021 Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines suggest using PCT along with a clinical evaluation to decide when to discontinue antibiotics in adults with an initial diagnosis of sepsis or septic shock and adequate source control, if the optimal duration of therapy is unclear and if PCT is available.

Cellulitis without abscess, ulcer, or purulent drainage — empiric antibiotic selection and MRSA coverage is outlined as follows: treatment with β-lactams, such as cefazolin or oxacillin, was successful in 96% of patients, suggesting MRSA-directed therapy is usually unnecessary; however, MRSA coverage may be prudent with penetrating trauma, illicit drug use, purulent drainage, or concurrent MRSA elsewhere. Options for MRSA include intravenous vancomycin, daptomycin, linezolid, or telavancin, or oral doxycycline, clindamycin, or SMX-TMP; if oral coverage for both streptococci and MRSA is desired, use clindamycin alone or combine SMX-TMP or doxycycline with a β-lactam (eg, penicillin, cephalosporin, or amoxicillin). The activity of doxycycline and SMX-TMP against β-hemolytic streptococci is not known, and in the absence of abscess, ulcer, or purulent drainage, β-lactam monotherapy is recommended; a double-blind study showed SMX-TMP plus cephalexin was no more efficacious than cephalexin alone in pure cellulitis.

Future directions — In nonpurulent cellulitis, the clinical isolation rate of a pathogen is < 20%, leaving an unconfirmed diagnosis 80% of the time; accordingly, this panel supports continued research into the rapid diagnosis of causes of cellulitis specifically, but SSTIs in general. Resistance patterns are evolving, as resistance of S. aureus to methicillin, erythromycin, clindamycin, tetracycline, and SMX-TMP has dramatically increased, with resistance of streptococci to erythromycin and clindamycin also reported.

### Antibiotic treatment of pediatric infections in primary healthcare setting: evaluation and comparison of 80 national treatment guidelines with the WHO AWaRe book recommendations [^20d8ecd0]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

First STEP–collection of STGs

Countries and infectious diseases selected

Eighty countries were selected based on the availability of national STGs to represent all six WHO regions: African Region (AFR), Region of the Americas (AMR), South-East Asia Region (SEAR), European Region (EUR), Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR), and Western Pacific Region (WPR).

Based on the AWaRe book's primary health care section, the main infections included in our study were: Upper Respiratory Tract Infections (URTIs), such as acute otitis media (AOM), pharyngitis, and acute sinusitis; Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP); odontogenic infections (periodontitis, bacterial gingivostomatitis, and odontogenic abscess); gastrointestinal infections, such as acute gastroenteritis (including acute hemorrhagic diarrhea like shigellosis), cholera, and enteric fever; skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs), including impetigo and cellulitis; and urinary tract infections (UTIs).

Search strategy

The bibliographic search was conducted in MEDLINE, EMBASE, SCOPUS using keywords like "national standard treatment guidelines", and "national antibiotic guidelines". Grey literature was reviewed to ensure comprehensive coverage, including pediatrics, infectious diseases, and general medicine National Scientific Societies' library (last search in May 2025). Additionally, for LMICs, public archives from Ministries of Health, drug regulatory agencies, national centers for the control of infectious diseases, and national reference institutes were consulted for STGs (last search in May 2025).

Inclusion and exclusion criteria

Documents developed or published by national institutions, the national Ministry of Health, national societies, or centers were included if they focused on pediatric (i.e. aged < 18 years) recommendations for single or multiple infectious diseases.

In cases of uncertainty regarding the validity of the documents, collaborators of Antibiotic Data to Inform Local Action project (ADILA) working in the relevant country were contacted.

Documents published or endorsed by international societies were excluded, unless they had been officially adapted by national societies.

Data extraction and collection

For each country and each infection with available STGs, data were collected for the three first-line and three second-line antibiotics recommended, including route of administration, daily dose (in mg/kg/day or IU/kg/day when available), frequency of administration, length of therapy, and recommendations for penicillin-allergic patients.

Erysipelas and cellulitis — evaluation and treatment recommendations are as follows: Cultures of blood or cutaneous aspirates, biopsies, or swabs are not routinely recommended (strong, moderate). Cultures of blood are recommended (strong, moderate), and cutaneous and microscopic examination of cutaneous aspirates, biopsies, or swabs should be considered in patients with malignancy on chemotherapy, neutropenia, severe cell-mediated immunodeficiency, immersion injuries, and animal bites (weak, moderate). Typical cases of cellulitis without systemic signs of infection should receive an antimicrobial agent that is active against streptococci (mild; Figure 1) (strong, moderate). For cellulitis with systemic signs of infection (moderate nonpurulent SSTI; Figure 1) systemic antibiotics are indicated. Many clinicians could include coverage against MSSA (weak, low). For patients whose cellulitis is associated with penetrating trauma, evidence of MRSA infection elsewhere, nasal colonization with MRSA, injection drug use, or SIRS (severe nonpurulent; Figure 1), vancomycin or another antimicrobial effective against both MRSA and streptococci is recommended (strong, moderate). In severely compromised patients (as defined in question 13), broad-spectrum antimicrobial coverage may be considered (weak, moderate). Vancomycin plus either piperacillin-tazobactam or imipenem-meropenem is recommended as a reasonable empiric regimen for severe infection (strong, moderate). The recommended duration of antimicrobial therapy is 5 days, but treatment should be extended if the infection has not improved within this time period (strong, high). Elevation of the affected area and treatment of predisposing factors, such as edema or underlying cutaneous disorders, are recommended (strong, moderate). In lower extremity cellulitis, clinicians should carefully examine the interdigital toe spaces because treating fissuring, scaling, or maceration may eradicate colonization with pathogens and reduce the incidence of recurrent infection (strong, moderate). Outpatient therapy is recommended for patients who do not have SIRS, altered mental status, or hemodynamic instability (mild nonpurulent; Figure 1) (strong, moderate). Hospitalization is recommended if there is concern for a deeper or necrotizing infection, for patients with poor adherence to therapy, for infection in a severely immunocompromised patient, or if outpatient treatment is failing (moderate or severe nonpurulent; Figure 1) (strong, moderate).

### Group C streptococcal cellulitis, looking deeper than the skin [^59222a84]. JAAD Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

We hope that this case will expand the range of pathophysiology known to be associated with GCS cellulitis, including rhabdomyolysis; whereas most cases of cellulitis are self-limited streptococcal infections, this case highlights the importance of being alert to toxin-mediated disease, with systemic symptoms out of proportion to visible surface inflammatory signs. This distinction is important because the default therapeutic response is often broader antibiotic coverage, whereas the most appropriate response for virulent yet antibiotic-sensitive pathogens, such as GCS, is more narrowly targeted high-dose antibiotics with vigilant clinical monitoring and supportive care to avoid a poor prognosis and prolonged hospitalization.

### Prioritization of randomized clinical trial questions for children hospitalized with common conditions: a consensus statement [^f6e95dcf]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Importance

There is a lack of randomized clinical trial (RCT) data to guide many routine decisions in the care of children hospitalized for common conditions. A first step in addressing the shortage of RCTs for this population is to identify the most pressing RCT questions for children hospitalized with common conditions.

Objective

To identify the most important and feasible RCT questions for children hospitalized with common conditions.

Design, Setting, and Participants

For this consensus statement, a 3-stage modified Delphi process was used in a virtual conference series spanning January 1 to September 29, 2022. Forty-six individuals from 30 different institutions participated in the process. Stage 1 involved construction of RCT questions for the 10 most common pediatric conditions leading to hospitalization. Participants used condition-specific guidelines and reviews from a structured literature search to inform their development of RCT questions. During stage 2, RCT questions were refined and scored according to importance. Stage 3 incorporated public comment and feasibility with the prioritization of RCT questions.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The main outcome was RCT questions framed in a PICO (population, intervention, control, and outcome) format and ranked according to importance and feasibility; score choices ranged from 1 to 9, with higher scores indicating greater importance and feasibility.

Results

Forty-six individuals (38 who shared demographic data; 24 women [63%]) from 30 different institutions participated in our modified Delphi process. Participants included children's hospital (n = 14) and community hospital (n = 13) pediatricians, parents of hospitalized children (n = 4), other clinicians (n = 2), biostatisticians (n = 2), and other researchers (n = 11). The process yielded 62 unique RCT questions, most of which are pragmatic, comparing interventions in widespread use for which definitive effectiveness data are lacking. Overall scores for importance and feasibility of the RCT questions ranged from 1 to 9, with a median of 5 (IQR, 4–7). Six of the top 10 selected questions focused on determining optimal antibiotic regimens for 3 common infections (pneumonia, urinary tract infection, and cellulitis).

Conclusions and Relevance

This consensus statementhas identified the most important and feasible RCT questions for children hospitalized with common conditions. This list of RCT questions can guide investigators and funders in conducting impactful trials to improve care and outcomes for hospitalized children.

### Improving antibiotic use in pediatric preseptal cellulitis using a clinical practice guideline [^965e6172]. Hospital Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of a clinical practice guideline (CPG) on antibiotic use and resource utilization for pediatric preseptal cellulitis.

Methods

This retrospective quasiexperimental study included patients between the age of 2 months and 17 years admitted for preseptal cellulitis between January 2013 and December 2023. The preseptal cellulitis CPG was implemented in December 2020 using a multifaceted strategy that included buy-in from key stakeholders, education of frontline providers, the official CPG launch, and stakeholder check-ins. The primary outcome was the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, including dual/triple therapy and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) active antibiotics. The secondary outcome was resource utilization including blood testing and imaging. Outcomes were compared pre- and post-CPG implementation using the Fisher exact test and logistic regressions.

Results

Of 236 patients meeting inclusion criteria, 175 and 61 patients composed the pre- and post-CPG cohorts, respectively. Median age (interquartile range) was 4.0 (1.8–8.3) years and 46% of the population were female. Post-CPG implementation changes in empirical antibiotic use included decreases in broad-spectrum use from 100% to 66% (P < .001), dual/triple therapy from 47% to 16% (P < .001), and MRSA active agents from 86% to 26% (P < .001). There was a decrease in complete blood count and blood culture orders from 75% to 57% (P = 0.014) and 32% to 18% (P = 0.047), respectively.

Conclusions

Use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, including dual/triple therapy and MRSA active antibiotics for the treatment of pediatric preseptal cellulitis, decreased after CPG implementation.

### Effect of cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole vs cephalexin alone on clinical cure of uncomplicated cellulitis: a randomized clinical trial [^0148392e]. JAMA (2017). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Emergency department visits for skin infections in the United States have increased with the emergence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). For cellulitis without purulent drainage, β-hemolytic streptococci are presumed to be the predominant pathogens. It is unknown if antimicrobial regimens possessing in vitro MRSA activity provide improved outcomes compared with treatments lacking MRSA activity.

Objective

To determine whether cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole yields a higher clinical cure rate of uncomplicated cellulitis than cephalexin alone.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Multicenter, double-blind, randomized superiority trial in 5 US emergency departments among outpatients older than 12 years with cellulitis and no wound, purulent drainage, or abscess enrolled from April 2009 through June 2012. All participants had soft tissue ultrasound performed at the time of enrollment to exclude abscess. Final follow-up was August 2012.

Interventions

Cephalexin, 500 mg 4 times daily, plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, 320 mg/1600 mg twice daily, for 7 days (n = 248 participants) or cephalexin plus placebo for 7 days (n = 248 participants).

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome determined a priori in the per-protocol group was clinical cure, defined as absence of these clinical failure criteria at follow-up visits: fever; increase in erythema (> 25%), swelling, or tenderness (days 3–4); no decrease in erythema, swelling, or tenderness (days 8–10); and more than minimal erythema, swelling, or tenderness (days 14–21). A clinically significant difference was defined as greater than 10%.

Results

Among 500 randomized participants, 496 (99%) were included in the modified intention-to-treat analysis and 411 (82.2%) in the per-protocol analysis (median age, 40 years [range, 15–78 years]; 58.4% male; 10.9% had diabetes). Median length and width of erythema were 13.0 cm and 10.0 cm. In the per-protocol population, clinical cure occurred in 182 (83.5%) of 218 participants in the cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole group vs 165 (85.5%) of 193 in the cephalexin group (difference, -2.0%; 95% CI, -9.7% to 5.7%; P = 0.50). In the modified intention-to-treat population, clinical cure occurred in 189 (76.2%) of 248 participants in the cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole group vs 171 (69.0%) of 248 in the cephalexin group (difference, 7.3%; 95% CI, -1.0% to 15.5%; P = 0.07). Between-group adverse event rates and secondary outcomes through 7 to 9 weeks, including overnight hospitalization, recurrent skin infections, and similar infection in household contacts, did not differ significantly.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among patients with uncomplicated cellulitis, the use of cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole compared to cephalexin alone did not result in higher rates of clinical resolution of cellulitis in the per-protocol analysis. However, because imprecision around the findings in the modified intention-to-treat analysis included a clinically important difference favoring cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, further research may be needed.

### Cellulitis in children: a retrospective single centre study from Australia [^0df62207]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2021). High credibility.

In our study, 3.6% of children had recurrent cellulitis compared with rates of 22%–49% in adults. In children, recurrent cellulitis is previously only reported in the context of lymphoedemaand periorbital cellulitis associated with rhinosinusitis. Our study demonstrates a high rate of recurrent cellulitis in children without these risk factors, with MRSA common in recurrent cellulitis. More studies are required to examine the risk factors for recurrent cellulitis in children and inform the use of prophylactic antibiotics and prevention strategies.

The choice and duration of antibiotics was strongly adherent to international guidelines (1–3 days intravenous antibiotics, 5–7 days total duration of antibiotics for moderate–severe cellulitis). Children with periorbital cellulitis required longer treatment duration (median 3 days intravenous, median 7 days total), which was also consistent with recommendations (2–3 days intravenous, 7–10 days total). Our reported length of stay is comparable to international studies of cellulitis and SSTI. Most non-admitted patients received oral antibiotics only, which is consistent with recommendations for treatment of mild cellulitis in children. The choice of antibiotic was also consistent with the PCH antimicrobial stewardship programme, ChAMP. Further opportunities to improve management of children with cellulitis presenting to hospital include incorporating evidence for early oral treatment using the highly bioavailable regimens of clindamycin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Evidence for use of these agents has been synthesised in recent years for children and adults to treat purulent cellutlitis and other uncomplicated SSTI in the outpatient setting. With increasing MRSA prevalence, these MRSA active agents with a strong evidence base are useful for paediatricians to consider.

### Antibiotic treatment of cellulitis and erysipelas… [^32d460f6]. JAMA Network (2019). Excellent credibility.

Question What is the most appropriate antibiotic choice, route of administration, and duration of treatment for cellulitis. Findings In this systematic review of 43 studies that included 5999 participants, no evidence was found to support the superiority of any 1 antibiotic over another and the use of intravenous over oral antibiotics; short treatment courses appear to be as effective as longer treatment courses. Meaning In light of low-quality evidence found for the most appropriate agent, route of administration, and duration of treatment for patients with cellulitis, additional research is required to define the optimum management of cellulitis. Importance The optimum antibiotic treatment for cellulitis and erysipelas lacks consensus. The available trial data do not demonstrate the superiority of any agent, and data are limited on the most appropriate route of administration or duration of therapy.

We included studies of adults or children with a cellulitis diagnosis that randomized participants to groups. We used the term cellulitis to include erysipelas, as the 2 conditions cannot be readily distinguished. The focus of this review was cellulitis requiring acute therapy with antibiotics rather than prophylaxis. We considered a randomized clinical trial if a comparison was made between different treatment regimens, including different antibiotics, routes of administration, and duration of therapy. One study50 compared cefalexin 500 mg twice a day with 250 mg 4 times a day. No difference was observed between the groups. The 2 studies by Daniel15 compared 5 days of azithromycin with 7 days of either cloxacillin or erythromycin. One study57 compared 5 days of oral levofloxacin with a 10-day regimen. Another study45 compared 6 days of tedizolid with 10 days of linezolid.

We identified 4 studies, although the only study58 designed specifically to compare oral with IV antibiotics was small and showed no statistical difference in outcomes. Two studies investigated an oral macrolide28 or an oral streptogramin29 against IV benzylpenicillin. The oral agents were shown to be more effective than the IV benzylpenicillin. Pallin et al48 included data on route of administration, although the study was not designed to examine this route.

### Management of children with uncomplicated cellulitis in emergency and hospital settings [^f87ac2c0]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

The aim of the study is to establish consensus recommendations on features used to determine the route of antibiotic administration and disposition for children with uncomplicated cellulitis.

Methods

Modified Delphi methodology was performed with 2 rounds of confidential surveys of Emergency medicine and hospital medicine (HM) providers at Lurie Children's Hospital to assess cellulitis management in children (ages 6 months-18 years) without signs of sepsis or abscess formation. Using a 9-point Likert scale, emergency medicine providers ranked features by perceived level of importance when deciding initial antibiotic route and HM providers ranked features on importance when transitioning to oral antibiotics. Responses were grouped as not important (1–3), neutral (4–6), and important (7–9) and re-evaluated in the second round to reach consensus, defined as ≥ 70% agreement.

Results

Emergency medicine providers (n = 17) reached consensus on 15 of 16 features (93.8%), 10 deemed important. Participants reached greatest consensus (100%) on fevers/chills, lymphangitis, and functional impairment as considerations for initiating intravenous antibiotics. HM providers (n = 15) reached consensus on 9 of 11 factors (81.8%), with 7 considered important when deciding on readiness for oral antibiotics. Providers indicated that stability, rather than reduction, of erythematous margins is sufficient to consider transition and de-escalation of therapy at less than 24 hours if all other clinical improvement criteria are met.

Conclusions

This study achieved consensus on important features for treatment and disposition of children with uncomplicated cellulitis in both emergency and inpatient contexts. These features have the potential to aid in decision making and improve standardization of clinical practice.

### Cellulitis in pediatric patients: recognition and management in the era of evolving resistance [^1bb3e10a]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Cellulitis, a bacterial skin infection most frequently caused by group A streptococci (Streptococcus pyogenes) and less so by Staphylococcus aureus, commonly occurs in pediatric patients. The non-specific clinical presentation of poorly demarcated, expanding erythema, and warmth is common to a multitude of similarly presenting conditions, contributing to challenges in accurate diagnosis. There is also no gold standard diagnostic test for cellulitis, as laboratory assessments, tissue and blood cultures, and imaging studies have not been helpful. These adjunctive studies may be useful, however, for ruling out mimickers or more serious or complicating conditions, such as osteomyelitis, necrotizing fasciitis, or abscess. Diagnosis remains largely clinical and evaluation by a dermatologist and/or infectious disease specialist continues to be the clinical gold standard. As a result, access to specialty care and further research into helpful adjunctive measures, such as thermal imaging, are imperative for accurate diagnosis and management to prevent inappropriate antibiosis. Multidrug resistance has continued to evolve since the initial emergence of community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, with more recent studies showing an overall decline of methicillin-resistant S. aureus in the community and highest rates remaining in the Southern region of the USA. Despite changing resistance patterns, inappropriate prescribing patterns have persisted and contribute to rising rates of resistance to antibiotics such as trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and clindamycin. Therefore, accurate diagnosis and subsequent management with the narrowest possible antimicrobial therapy is ideal both for individual patient outcomes and for public health.

RESULTS

Characteristics of study participants

Patient screening, enrollment, and follow‐up are described in Figure 1. Of 3,104 patients presented to site EDs with SSTI screened during the usual care period and 3,293 patients screened during the clinical pathway period, 160 (5.2%) and 153 (4.7%) participants were enrolled, respectively. Four enrolled patients during the usual care period were missing information regarding antibiotic dose and were excluded. The study population consisted of 156 participants on usual care and 153 participants on the clinical pathway. Of these, 145 (92.9%) and 141 (92.2%) were followed through 14 days, and 121 (77.6%) and 128 (83.7%) were followed through 44 days in the usual care and clinical pathway time periods, respectively.

FIGURE 1
During the usual care and clinical pathway periods, patients were selected if they fulfilled eligibility requirements, i.e. adults with cellulitis, abscess, or wound infection with an infected area of ≥ 75 cm² and a known or suspected Gram‐positive infection without other indications for hospitalization (e.g. unstable coorbidities, requiring the operating room or intensive care). In the usual care period, participants were treated for SSTI based on usual care. Once the usual care period was completed, over 2 to 4 weeks prior to the initiation of the clinical pathway period, each site's principal investigator and study coordinators trained physicians and other ED staff on the clinical pathway. During the clinical pathway period, all participants were administered a single IV dose of dalbavancin in the ED. For participants who did not have follow‐up contact through 44 days, it was assumed that there were no additional hospitalizations beyond the last follow‐up contact if review of their electronic medical records at the site hospital did not identify subsequent hospital admission.

Methods

Intervention timeline

The Michigan Medicine Ambulatory Antimicrobial Stewardship Program instituted serial interventions to improve antibiotic prescribing for outpatient pediatric SSTI. The primary intervention was a pediatric SmartSet, an EMR-embedded CDS tool used to guide therapy at the time of the visit (Epic, Epic Systems Corporation, Verona, Wisconsin).

Institutional SSTI treatment guidelines for pediatric and adult patients were developed in July 2019, followed by dedicated SSTI education for general pediatricians in May 2020. General medicine and family medicine practitioners received generalized education on the management of common infections, including SSTI. The pediatric SmartSet was developed with a general pediatrics champion and was implemented in December 2020. It includes a templated progress note and prepopulated options for guideline-concordant antibiotic prescribing based on diagnosis (impetigo, cellulitis, or abscess). In May 2021, a Tableau dashboard (Tableau software, Seattle, WA) was developed with the quality and analytics team. The dashboard displays the rate of prescriptions with an inappropriate antibiotic duration for adult and pediatric SSTI, as well as rates by clinic and provider, allowing for individual review of inappropriate cases.

Study design, setting, and population

In this quasi-experimental, before-and after study, adult patients (aged ≥ 21 years) and pediatric patients (aged 2 months to < 21 years) were included if they were prescribed an enteral antibiotic within 3 days of a Michigan Medicine primary care or general surgery encounter (ie, in-person, virtual, or telephone) with an International Classification of Disease, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) diagnosis code for impetigo, cellulitis, or cutaneous abscess. Prescriptions of < 3 days or > 14 days were excluded because these durations were likely not prescribed for uncomplicated SSTI. The SmartSet was implemented in December 2020. The preintervention period was July 2019 through December 2020, and the postintervention period was January 2021 through December 2021.

Primary outcome

The primary outcome was the proportion of antibiotic prescriptions for pediatric SSTI with an inappropriate duration, defined as > 7 days. Institutional SSTI guidelines, consistent with Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines, recommend 5-day treatment courses for impetigo, cellulitis, and abscess, with extension to 7 days for slow clinical response.

### Efficacy and safety of intravenous ceftriaxone at home versus intravenous flucloxacillin in hospital for children with cellulitis (CHOICE): a single-centre, open-label, randomised, controlled, non-inferiority trial [^5c1a4102]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Background

Outpatient parenteral antimicrobial therapy in children is common despite no evidence of its efficacy or safety from clinical trials. We aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of intravenous antibiotic therapy at home with that of standard treatment in hospital for children with moderate to severe cellulitis.

Methods

The Cellulitis at Home or Inpatient in Children from the Emergency Department (CHOICE) trial was a randomised, controlled, non-inferiority trial in children aged 6 months to 18 years who presented to the emergency department at The Royal Children's Hospital (Melbourne, VIC, Australia) with uncomplicated moderate to severe cellulitis. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either intravenous ceftriaxone (50 mg/kg once daily) at home or intravenous flucloxacillin (50 mg/kg every 6 h) in hospital with web-based randomisation, stratified by age and periorbital cellulitis. The primary outcome was treatment failure, which was defined as no clinical improvement or occurrence of an adverse event, resulting in a change in empiric antibiotics within 48 h of the first dose. Secondary outcomes included adverse events and acquisition of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Outcomes were assessed in all randomised participants with outcome data (intention-to-treat population) and in all individuals who received treatment as allocated and did not have any major protocol violations (per-protocol population). For home treatment to be non-inferior to hospital treatment, the difference between groups in the proportion of children with treatment failure in the intention-to-treat population had to be less than 15%. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02334124.

Findings

Between Jan 9, 2015, and June 15, 2017, we screened 1135 children for eligibility, of whom 190 were randomly assigned to receive ceftriaxone at home (n = 95) or flucloxacillin in hospital (n = 95). The intention-to-treat analysis comprised 188 children (93 in the home group and 95 in the hospital group) because two children in the home group were found to be ineligible after randomisation and were excluded. Treatment failure occurred in two (2%) children in the home group and in seven (7%) children in the hospital group (risk difference -5.2%, 95% CI -11.3 to 0.8, p = 0.088). In the per-protocol analysis, treatment failure occurred in one (1%) of 89 children in the home group and in seven (8%) of 91 children in the hospital group (-6.5%, -12.4 to -0.7). Fewer children treated at home than in hospital had an adverse event (two [2%] vs ten [11%]; p = 0.048). There was no difference between groups in rates of nasal acquisition of meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus or gastrointestinal acquisition of extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing bacteria or Clostridium difficile after 3 months.

Interpretation

Home treatment with intravenous ceftriaxone is not inferior to treatment in hospital with intravenous flucloxacillin for children with cellulitis. The standard of care for the intravenous treatment of uncomplicated cellulitis in children should be home or outpatient care when feasible.

### 2018 WSES / SIS-E consensus conference: recommendations for the management of skin and soft-tissue infections [^7ae6ae84]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Cellulitis is an acute bacterial infection of the dermis and the subcutaneous tissue that most commonly affects the lower extremities, although it can affect other areas. It causes local signs of inflammation, such as warmth, erythema, pain, lymphangitis, and frequently systemic upset with fever and raised white blood cell count. As already reported in a previous paragraph, cellulitis has been recently classified as an ABSSSI together with erysipelas, SSIs, and major abscesses.

In a large European multicenter study, Garau et al. analyzed a population of patients diagnosed with complicated SSTI hospitalized between December 2010 and January 2011 reporting that cellulitis was the most frequent diagnosis accounting for 59.1% of the total. Streptococci cause diffuse, rapidly spreading infection; staphylococcal cellulitis is typically more localized.

Treatment should begin promptly with agents effective against the typical Gram-positive pathogens, especially streptococci. If the cellulitis is very early and mild and no significant co-morbidities are present, oral beta-lactams might be sufficient in areas where CA-MRSA is not prevalent. Other available options are macrolides and lincosamides; however, resistance to erythromycin and clindamycin are increasing. Fluoroquinolones have been approved for the treatment of most uncomplicated cellulitis but are not adequate for treatment of MRSA infections. For more severe infections, parenteral route is the first choice.

If MRSA is suspected (both hospital acquired MRSA [HA-MRSA] and CA-MRSA), glycopeptides and newer antimicrobials are the best options. For a simple superficial abscess or boil, incision and drainage is the primary treatment, and antibiotics are not needed. To be considered a simple abscess, induration and erythema should be limited only to a defined area of the abscess and should not extend beyond its borders. Additionally, simple abscesses do not extend into deeper tissues or have multiloculated extension. Cutaneous abscesses are typically caused by bacteria that represent the normal regional skin flora of the involved area.

### 2018 WSES / SIS-E consensus conference: recommendations for the management of skin and soft-tissue infections [^168387e9]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

What oral antibiotics can be used for the management of MRSA skin and soft-tissue infections (SSTIs)? What intravenous antibiotics can be used for the management of MRSA skin and soft-tissue infections?

For oral antibiotic coverage of MRSA in patients with SSTI, we suggest the following agents: linezolid (recommendation 1A), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) (recommendation 1B), a tetracycline (doxycycline or minocycline) (recommendation 1B), or tedizolid (Recommendation 1A).

For intravenous (IV) antibiotic coverage of MRSA in patients with SSTI, we suggest the following agents: daptomycin (10 mg/kg/dose IV once daily) (recommendation 1A), IV linezolid (recommendation 1A), IV ceftaroline (recommendation 1A), IV dalbavancin (recommendation 1A), IV vancomycin (recommendation 1A), IV tigecycline (recommendation 1A), or IV tedizolid (recommendation 1A).

Seven to 14 days of therapy is recommended but should be individualized on the basis of the patient's clinical response (recommendation 1A). IV to oral switch should occur when criteria of clinical stability have been reached (recommendation 1C).

For CA-MRSA, recommended oral agents are clindamycin, although clindamycin resistance is now very common, tetracyclines, TMP-SMX, linezolid, tedizolid, and occasionally, fluoroquinolones. Several observational studies and one small randomized trial suggest that TMP-SMX, doxycycline, and minocycline are effective for such infections. If coverage for both streptococci and MRSA is desired for oral therapy, options include clindamycin alone, or the combination of either TMP-SMX or doxycycline with a beta-lactam (e.g. penicillin, cephalexin, or amoxicillin).

### ED management of cellulitis: a review of five urban centers [^18304179]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Cellulitis is a common problem presenting to the emergency department (ED). This study examines the epidemiology of cellulitis in 5 Canadian urban EDs and determines the practice variation in this management among sites. From computerized provincial ED diagnosis information, 10% of cellulitis charts from April 1, 1997 to March 31, 1998 were randomly selected for review. All 5 EDs in one urban region were sampled; physicians were unaware of the study when seeing patients. A standardized audit form was used to collect information pertaining to visits for the incident infection case. Cases were excluded if simple cellulitis was not the primary diagnosis or if procedures such as incision and drainage were initially required. A total of 416 adult charts were retrospectively identified. The mean age was 46 years and 61% were men; 38% had seen another physician before the ED presentation. Cellulitis was most commonly located in the upper (41%) and lower (48%) extremities. Most cases were treated with intravenous cefazolin (58%; range among sites: 49%-66%); however, over 25 different antibiotics and doses were initially prescribed. Each case required a median of 4 (interquartile range [IQR]: 1, 9) ED visits. Some patients (14%) received an increase in dose (3%) or a change in antibiotic regimen (11%) during their treatment. Few patients (3%) required a second change in regimen. Specialist consultations were obtained in only 6% of patients and hospitalization was rare (7%). The most common discharge prescription was oral cephalexin (62%); however; many different regimens were prescribed. Cellulitis is a common ED problem which consumes considerable resources to treat. Considerable practice variation exists with respect to in-ED and post-ED management. These results suggest the need for the development of practice guidelines for the treatment of this common ED problem.

### Predictors of failure of empiric outpatient antibiotic therapy in emergency department patients with uncomplicated cellulitis [^edbf81dd]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Despite several expert panel recommendations and cellulitis treatment guidelines, there are currently no clinical decision rules to assist clinicians in deciding which emergency department (ED) patients should be treated with oral antibiotics and which patients require intravenous (IV) therapy at first presentation of cellulitis amenable to outpatient treatment.

Objectives

The objective was to determine risk factors associated with adult patients presenting to the ED with cellulitis who fail initial antibiotic therapy as outpatients and require a change of antibiotics or admission to hospital.

Methods

This was a prospective cohort study of patients 18 years of age or older presenting with cellulitis to one of two tertiary care EDs (combined annual census 140,000). Patients were excluded if they had been treated with antibiotics for the cellulitis before presenting to the ED, if they were admitted to the hospital, or if they had an abscess only. Trained research personnel administered a questionnaire at the initial ED visit with telephone follow-up 2 weeks later. Multivariable logistic regression models determined predictor variables independently associated with treatment failure (failed initial antibiotic therapy and required a change of antibiotics or admission to hospital).

Results

A total of 598 patients were enrolled, 52 were excluded, and 49 were lost to follow-up. The mean (± standard deviation [SD]) age was 53.1 (± 18.4) years and 56.4% were male. A total of 185 patients (37.2%) were given oral antibiotics, 231 (46.5%) were given IV antibiotics, and 81 patients (16.3%) received both oral and IV antibiotics in the ED. A total of 102 (20.5%, 95% confidence [CI] = 17.2% to 24.2%) patients had treatment failures. Fever (temperature > 38°C) at triage (odds ratio [OR] = 4.3, 95% CI = 1.6 to 11.7), chronic leg ulcers (OR = 2.5, 95% CI = 1.1 to 5.2), chronic edema or lymphedema (OR = 2.5, 95% CI = 1.5 to 4.2), prior cellulitis in the same area (OR = 2.1, 95% CI = 1.3 to 3.5), and cellulitis at a wound site (OR = 1.9, 95% CI = 1.2 to 3.0) were independently associated with treatment failure.

Conclusions

These risk factors should be considered when initiating empiric antibiotic therapy for ED patients with cellulitis amenable to outpatient treatment.

### Clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of acute bacterial sinusitis in children aged 1 to 18 years [^b13406de]. Pediatrics (2013). Medium credibility.

Complications of acute bacterial sinusitis should be diagnosed when the patient develops signs or symptoms of orbital and/or central nervous system (intracranial) involvement. Mild cases of preseptal cellulitis (eyelid < 50% closed) may be treated on an outpatient basis with appropriate oral antibiotic therapy (high-dose amoxicillin-clavulanate for comprehensive coverage) for acute bacterial sinusitis and daily follow-up until definite improvement is noted. If the patient does not improve within 24 to 48 hours or if the infection is progressive, it is appropriate to admit the patient to the hospital for antimicrobial therapy. If proptosis, impaired visual acuity, or impaired and/or painful extraocular mobility is present on examination, the patient should be hospitalized, and a contrast-enhanced CT should be performed. A contrast-enhanced CT scan (preferably coronal thin cut) of the head, orbits, and sinuses is essential to confirm intracranial or intraorbital suppurative complications; in such cases, intravenous antibiotics should be started immediately, and an MRI may also be desirable in some cases of intracranial abnormality. Appropriate antimicrobial therapy for intraorbital complications include vancomycin (to cover possible methicillin-resistant S aureus or penicillin-resistant S pneumoniae) and either ceftriaxone, ampicillin-sulbactam, or piperacillin-tazobactam; for intracranial complications, coverage for anaerobes (ie, metronidazole) should also be considered and should be started in all cases of intracranial complications if ceftriaxone is prescribed. Patients with small orbital, subperiosteal, or epidural abscesses and minimal ocular and neurologic abnormalities may be managed with intravenous antibiotic treatment for 24 to 48 hours while performing frequent visual and mental status checks, but in patients who develop progressive signs and symptoms, such as impaired visual acuity, ophthalmoplegia, elevated intraocular pressure (> 20 mm), severe proptosis (> 5 mm), altered mental status, headache, or vomiting, as well as those who fail to improve within 24 to 48 hours while receiving antibiotics, prompt surgical intervention and drainage of the abscess should be undertaken. Antibiotics can be tailored to the results of culture and sensitivity studies when they become available.

### Pediatric cellulitis: success of emergency department short-course intravenous antibiotics [^7bdd8513]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2010). Low credibility.

Objectives

The administration of 1 to 2 doses of intravenous (IV) antibiotics in the emergency department (ED) followed by discharge on oral antibiotics has become a treatment option for children with cellulitis, despite an absence of evidence supporting this practice. The objective of this study was to determine the failure rate of ED short-course IV antibiotic therapy (IV-short course).

Methods

This retrospective study included children aged 0 to 18 years diagnosed with cellulitis in a pediatric ED during the 2005 calendar year. Treatment was categorized as (a) discharge on outpatient oral antibiotics, (b) IV-short course, or (c) admission for IV antibiotics (IV-admit). Failure was defined by a subsequent visit less than 7 days since the index visit with a change in antibiotic treatment, the administration of IV antibiotics, or hospitalization. A second data abstractor reviewed 10% of the charts to allow calculation of interobserver scores.

Results

There were 321 eligible children, of whom 154 children were treated with oral antibiotics, 85 IV-short course, and 82 IV-admit. A total of 23 patients (7%) met criteria for failure. Compared with IV-admit, the odds ratio of failure among those who received IV-short course was 7.2 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.6–33.1). Those who received IV-short course were more likely to revisit within 7 days than were children treated with oral antibiotics alone (risk ratio, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.2–4.7); however, revisits were no more frequent than among children in the IV-admit group (risk ratio, 2.8; 95% CI, 0.65–12.1). The total mean duration of hospital stay was significantly less in the IV-short course group compared with the IV-admit group (14.9 vs 118.6 hours; P < 0.001).

Conclusions

Children with cellulitis frequently receive IV antibiotics. Short-course IV antibiotic therapy is associated with a high failure rate and prolonged ED stay compared with those in children treated with oral antibiotics alone. However, their clinical similarity to the IV-admit group, shorter length of hospital stay, but high failure rate mandates further evaluation before widespread adoption.

### Who can have parenteral antibiotics at home? a prospective observational study in children with moderate / severe cellulitis [^c6138ba9]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The benefits of treating children at home or in an ambulatory setting have been well documented. We aimed to describe the characteristics and evaluate the outcomes of children with moderate/severe cellulitis treated at home with intravenous (IV) ceftriaxone via direct referral from the Emergency Department to a hospital-in-the-home (HITH) program.

Methods

Patients aged 3 months to 18 years with moderate/severe cellulitis referred from a tertiary pediatric Emergency Department to HITH from September 2012 to January 2014 were prospectively identified. Data collection included demographics, clinical features, microbiological characteristics and outcomes. To ensure home treatment did not result in inferior outcomes, these patients were retrospectively compared with patients who were hospitalized for IV flucloxacillin, the standard-of-care over the same period. The primary outcome was home treatment failure necessitating hospital admission. Secondary outcomes included antibiotic changes, complications, length of stay and cost.

Results

Forty-one (28%) patients were treated on HITH and 103 (72%) were hospitalized. Compared with hospitalized patients, HITH patients were older (P < 0.01) and less likely to have periorbital cellulitis (P = 0.01) or fever (P = 0.04). There were no treatment failures under HITH care. The rate of antibiotic changes was similar in both groups (5% vs. 7%, P = 0.67), as was IV antibiotic duration (2.3 vs. 2.5 days, P = 0.23).

Conclusion

Older children with moderate/severe limb cellulitis without systemic symptoms can be treated at home. To ascertain if this practice can be applied more widely, a comparative prospective, ideally randomized, study is needed.

Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2021). High credibility.

Acute hematogenous osteomyelitis (AHO) in children — when a child is not responding despite what is believed to be the best antimicrobial and surgical therapy, complete reevaluation of the child should be considered rather than empirically broadening antibacterial coverage or restarting antibiotics, and the benefits of such reassessment are believed to be large and unequivocal.

### Early response in cellulitis: a prospective study of dynamics and predictors [^b66058c2]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

In this prospective study of cellulitis, several nonpharmacological factors were associated with lack of early response. Such early nonresponse was rarely related to inappropriate therapy but strongly predictive of early treatment escalation, suggesting that broadening antibiotic treatment often may be premature.

### Aztreonam treatment of Pasteurella multocida cellulitis and bacteremia [^d0a71b90]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To report a case of Pasteurella multocida cellulitis and bacteremia treated successfully with aztreonam.

Case Summary

An 81-year-old white man with multiple antibiotic allergies was admitted with severe cellulitis of the left arm and bacteremia due to P. multocida. The patient was treated for 14 days with aztreonam and had complete resolution of the infection.

Discussion

To our knowledge, this is the first published case describing successful treatment of P. multocida cellulitis and bacteremia with aztreonam. Antimicrobials recommended for use in P. multocida infections include penicillin, ampicillin, amoxicillin, second- and third-generation cephalosporins, tetracyclines, fluoroquinolones, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. There is very little information in the current literature regarding the activity of aztreonam toward P. multocida.

Conclusions

This case demonstrates the potential use of aztreonam for P. multocida cellulitis and bacteremia in those instances where antibiotics of choice cannot be given.

### Clinical outcomes in patients hospitalized with cellulitis treated with oral clindamycin and trimethoprim / sulfamethoxazole: the role of weight-based dosing [^b2508002]. The Journal of Infection (2017). Low credibility.

Objectives

Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) and clindamycin are frequently prescribed to treat cellulitis. The primary objective was to determine if weight-based dosing of these antibiotics is associated with better outcomes in cellulitis. The secondary objective was to assess variables associated with clinical failure among hospitalized patients with cellulitis with or without cutaneous abscess.

Methods

This multi-center retrospective cohort study was conducted from January 1, 2010 to September 4, 2014. Adult patients admitted for cellulitis who received a minimum of seven days of therapy and discharged on oral clindamycin or TMP/SMX were included. Binary univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to identify risk factors for clinical failure, including the impact of dose adequacy of clindamycin and TMP/SMX on clinical outcomes.

Results

A total of 208 cases met inclusion criteria. Of these cases, 120 (57.7%) received inadequate dosing of clindamycin (< 10 mg/kg/day) or TMP/SMX (< 5 mg TMP/kg per day) while 88 (42.3%) received adequate dosing. Clinical failure occurred in 36/120 (30%) and 15/88 (17%) of patients receiving inadequate and adequate doses, respectively (p = 0.032). Upon univariate analysis length of stay ≥ 7 days (OR = 2.96, p = 0.046) and inadequate dosing (OR = 2.09, p = 0.034) were associated with clinical failure. Upon multivariate analysis, inadequate dosing was independently associated with clinical failure (OR = 2.01, p = 0.032).

Conclusion

Inadequate dosing of clindamycin and TMP/SMX is independently associated with clinical failure in patients hospitalized with cellulitis. Further prospective studies evaluating weight-based dosing of clindamycin and TMP/SMX in the setting of cellulitis are warranted.

Purulent cellulitis

Incision and drainage are recommended as primary management for abscesses with associated cellulitis. In these cases, antibiotics is generally suggested.

Empiric antibiotic regimens. Normal renal function
Target Pathogen: S. aureus including CA-MRSA.

Outpatient therapy or step-down
One of the following oral antibiotics
Amoxicillin-clavulanate 1 g every 8 h
Cephalexin 500 mg every 6 h

or
In a region or a population with a high prevalence of CA-MRSA, where > 10% of clinical S. aureus isolates are MRSA isolates or in patients at high risk for CA-MRSA
Trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole 160/800–320/1600 mg every 12 h
Minocycline 100 mg every 12 h
Doxycycline 100 mg every 12 h

or

Inpatient therapy
One of the following intravenous antibiotics
Vancomycin 25–30 mg/kg loading dose then 15–20 mg/kg/dose every 12 h
Linezolid 600 mg every 12 h
In patients at risk for Gram-negative infections or severe forms who do not respond to first-line therapy consider
Piperacillin/tazobactam 4,5 g every 6 h.

Culture is not recommended as principle for identifying the causative bacteria in cellulitis patients. However, in immunosuppressed patients or those with neutropenia or in severe forms associated with systemic signs of inflammation or that do not respond to first-line therapy, culture may be helpful to identify the causative bacteria and define a targeted therapy.

Cellulitis in following situations can be life-threatening thus requiring early diagnosis and prompt intervention:

Orbital cellulitis The infection usually spreads from paranasal sinuses and the patient presents with proptosis, chemosis, ophthalmoplegia and diminished vision due to pressure on optic nerve. Uncontrolled infection may have intra-cranial extension leading to cavernous sinus thrombosis and meningitis. Early intravenous empirical antibiotic therapy is required. Surgical drainage is required in progressive disease to prevent loss of vision.

Ludwigs angina It is cellulitis of submandibular region occurring deep to deep cervical fascia leading to brawny induration in this region with edema of floor of the mouth. Untreated cases may have laryngeal edema and stridor. In case of no response to antibiotics, liberal fasciotomy of deep cervical fascia in the submandibular region is required.

### Management of cellulitis in a pediatric emergency department [^2d4cc2fa]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2007). Low credibility.

Objectives

(1) To determine antibiotic choices, route of administration, and outcomes of children treated as outpatients with noncomplicated, nonfacial cellulitis at a tertiary care center. (2) To determine the number of visits and time spent in the emergency department (ED) for treatment.

Design

A descriptive case-control study.

Setting

A tertiary care pediatric ED at an academic medical center.

Methods

Medical records of all otherwise healthy children (aged 1–16 yrs) presenting with noncomplicated, nonfacial cellulitis over a 3-year period (January 1, 2001-December 31, 2003) were reviewed. Data extracted included the following: demographics; clinical presentation; laboratory and microbiology results; management, including choice, dose, and route of antibiotic(s); treatment failures; and time spent in the ED.

Interventions

None.

Main Results

Two hundred sixty-nine patients met the inclusion criteria, and their charts were selected for review. The oral antibiotic most often prescribed was cephalexin (N = 105). Treatment failure occurred in 10 (8.9%) of the cases. The intravenous antibiotic most often prescribed was cefazolin (N = 124; 39 received cefazolin alone, and 85 received cefazolin and probenecid). The cefazolin-only group had 12 (31%) treatment failures, whereas the cefazolin and probenecid group had 7 (8.1%) treatment failures. More time in the ED (521 ± 287 minutes) and more visits (3.4 ± 2.8) were seen in the intravenous group as compared with the oral group (time in ED, 164 ± 139 minutes; visits, 1.4 ± 1).

Conclusions

Noncomplicated, nonfacial cellulitis is most commonly treated using first-generation cephalosporins. Treatment with oral antibiotics was effective and required fewer visits and less time in the ED compared with intravenous treatment. Twice-daily cefazolin and probenecid was associated with less treatment failures and admissions than cefazolin alone and may represent a reasonable alternative for children with nonfacial cellulitis requiring intravenous antibiotics.

### Clinical guidance for group A streptococcal cellulitis… [^46aa3366]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Multiple bacteria can cause cellulitis.
- Cellulitis typically involves erythema, pain, and warmth locally and can include systemic symptoms.
- Diagnosed by physical examination, cellulitis is treated with antibiotics.
- Prevention focuses on good wound care. Treatment Never delay the initiation of treatment while waiting for culture results. Use culture results, when available, to tailor antibiotic therapy. Antibiotic therapy for non-purulent cellulitis IDSA recommends treatment with an antibiotic that is active against streptococci. Healthcare providers may select antibiotics that cover both Staphylococcus aureus and group A strep. Treatment options Treat mild cellulitis with oral antibiotics, while intravenous antibiotics can be considered for systematic infections. Group A strep remains susceptible to beta-lactam antibiotics.
- Cephalosporins
- Clindamycin
- Dicloxacillin
- Penicillin
- Cefazolin
- Ceftriaxone
- Clindamycin
- Penicillin Treatment duration The recommended treatment duration is 5 days for most cellulitis cases. Cases in which there has not been improvement during this time period may require longer durations of treatment. Other treatment In addition, the following actions are recommended to reduce the risk of recurrent infection:

- Elevate the affected area
- Treat predisposing factors Complications Complications from cellulitis are uncommon but can include serious infections. Occasionally: Cellulitis can result in bacteremia. Rarely: Cellulitis can result in deep tissue infections, such as
- Infective endocarditis
- Osteomyelitis
- Septic thrombophlebitis
- Suppurative arthritis. Prevention Reduce the spread of group A strep bacteria with standard infection control practices, including good hand hygiene and respiratory etiquette.

Wound care Early identification and management of superficial skin lesions is also key to cellulitis prevention. Patients with recurrent lower-extremity cellulitis should be inspected for tinea pedis and it should be treated if present. Traumatic or bite wounds should be cleaned and managed appropriately to prevent secondary infections.

### Avoidable antibiotic exposure for uncomplicated skin and soft tissue infections in the ambulatory care setting [^52888ad1]. The American Journal of Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Uncomplicated skin and soft tissue infections are among the most frequent indications for outpatient antibiotics. A detailed understanding of current prescribing practices is necessary to optimize antibiotic use for these conditions.

Methods

This was a retrospective cohort study of children and adults treated in the ambulatory care setting for uncomplicated cellulitis, wound infection, or cutaneous abscess between March 1, 2010 and February 28, 2011. We assessed the frequency of avoidable antibiotic exposure, defined as the use of antibiotics with broad gram-negative activity, combination antibiotic therapy, or treatment for 10 or more days. Total antibiotic-days prescribed for the cohort were compared with antibiotic-days in 4 hypothetical short-course (5–7 days), single-antibiotic treatment models consistent with national guidelines.

Results

A total of 364 cases were included for analysis (155 cellulitis, 41 wound infection, and 168 abscess). Antibiotics active against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus were prescribed in 61% of cases of cellulitis. Of 139 cases of abscess where drainage was performed, antibiotics were prescribed in 80% for a median of 10 (interquartile range, 7–10) days. Of 292 total cases where complete prescribing data were available, avoidable antibiotic exposure occurred in 46%. This included use of antibiotics with broad gram-negative activity in 4%, combination therapy in 12%, and treatment for 10 or more days in 42%. Use of the short-course, single-antibiotic treatment strategies would have reduced prescribed antibiotic-days by 19% to 55%.

Conclusions

Approximately half of uncomplicated skin infections involved avoidable antibiotic exposure. Antibiotic use could be reduced through treatment approaches using short courses of a single antibiotic.

A panel of national experts was convened by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) to update the 2005 guidelines for the treatment of skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs). The panel's recommendations were developed to be concordant with the recently published IDSA guidelines for the treatment of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections. The focus of this guideline is the diagnosis and appropriate treatment of diverse SSTIs ranging from minor superficial infections to life-threatening infections such as necrotizing fasciitis. In addition, because of an increasing number of immunocompromised hosts worldwide, the guideline addresses the wide array of SSTIs that occur in this population. These guidelines emphasize the importance of clinical skills in promptly diagnosing SSTIs, identifying the pathogen, and administering effective treatments in a timely fashion.

### Clinical practice guideline: tympanostomy tubes in children (update) [^b23b0be6]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Acute tympanostomy tube otorrhea (TTO) in children — For uncomplicated acute TTO, clinicians should prescribe topical antibiotic ear drops only, without oral antibiotics, and this is a Strong recommendation. Acute refers to otorrhea of less than 4 weeks' duration, and uncomplicated refers to TTO that is not accompanied by high fever (38.5 °C, 101.3 °F), concurrent illness requiring systemic antibiotics, or cellulitis extending beyond the external ear canal to involve the pinna or adjacent skin; this recommendation does not apply to prophylactic administration of drops at the time of tube placement or prescription of drops for immediate use after tubes. Exceptions include children with complicated otorrhea, cellulitis of adjacent skin, or concurrent bacterial infection requiring antibiotics, or those who are immunocompromised; the aggregate evidence quality is Grade B with a high level of confidence.

Pediatric acute hematogenous osteomyelitis (AHO) — Empiric anti-staphylococcal coverage is prioritized, and empiric therapy with an anti-staphylococcal antibiotic is essential; in regions where the prevalence of community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) causing pediatric AHO is low, cefazolin or oxacillin/nafcillin is preferred for empiric therapy of presumed methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA), whereas for regions with CA-MRSA prevalence 10% to 20% or greater, clindamycin or vancomycin is preferred; for clinically stable children, cefazolin is reasonable empiric therapy pending cultures or when close observation is appropriate; when clindamycin resistance in MRSA is substantial (approximately 10% to 20% or greater), vancomycin is preferred for empiric therapy for CA-MRSA; selection should be guided by local antibiotic resistance patterns and/or hospital antibiogram and disease severity; other CA-MRSA–active agents exist but data are insufficient to suggest routine therapy, and despite in vitro activity of many antibiotics, the lack of dosing, outcomes, and safety data does not permit recommendations for their routine use at this time.

### Cellulitis: diagnosis and management [^5760abd6]. Dermatologic Therapy (2011). Low credibility.

Cellulitis is an acute infection of the dermal and subcutaneous layers of the skin, often occurring after a local skin trauma. It is a common diagnosis in both inpatient and outpatient dermatology, as well as in the primary care setting. Cellulitis classically presents with erythema, swelling, warmth, and tenderness over the affected area. There are many other dermatologic diseases, which can present with similar findings, highlighting the need to consider a broad differential diagnosis. Some of the most common mimics of cellulitis include venous stasis dermatitis, contact dermatitis, deep vein thrombosis, and panniculitis. History, local characteristics of the affected area, systemic signs, laboratory tests, and, in some cases, skin biopsy can be helpful in confirming the correct diagnosis. Most patients can be treated as an outpatient with oral antibiotics, with dicloxacillin or cephalexin being the oral therapy of choice when methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus is not a concern.

### Population pharmacokinetic and pharmacokinetic / pharmacodynamic target attainment analyses for dalbavancin in pediatric patients [^f364e288]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI) are a significant source of morbidity in children, with cutaneous abscesses and cellulitis being the predominant skin infections treated by pediatricians. If diagnosed early and treated appropriately, these infections are almost always curable, but some have the potential to cause hospitalization and serious life-threatening complications. Since the year 2000, rates of hospitalizations among pediatric patients with skin and skin structure infections (SSSI) have increased rapidly, with a 2013 survey showing a doubling between 1997 and 2009 to exceed 70,000 per year. This increase, which is also seen in adult patients with SSSI, coincided with the emergence of resistant pathogens, including community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA), with many areas in the United States now reporting > 40% MRSA rates among SSSI isolates. –

For more than 50 years, vancomycin has been the mainstay of antibacterial therapy for severe infections caused by resistant Gram-positive organisms, including MRSA. However, vancomycin is associated with a risk of nephrotoxicity, the need for drug monitoring, and the emergence of resistant S aureus and enterococci strains. Current guidelines from the Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) for the diagnosis and management of ABSSSIwere published before the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency approved dalbavancin, a second-generation, intravenous (IV) lipoglycopeptide, in 2014 and 2015, respectively, for the treatment of adults with ABSSSI known or suspected to be caused by susceptible strains of the following Gram-positive microorganisms: S aureus (including methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant strains), Streptococcus pyogenes, S agalactiae, S dysgalactiae, S anginosus (including S anginosus, S intermedius, S constellatus), and vancomycin-susceptible strains of Enterococcus faecalis. Dalbavancin is also approved in the United States for the treatment of ABSSSI in pediatric patients from birth to < 18 years, and is the first and only single-dose IV treatment for ABSSSI currently approved in the United States and the European Union. The pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of dalbavancin, including its long half-life, makes it a convenient treatment option, even in the outpatient setting, and a single-dose regimen may improve compliance and reduce healthcare resource use.

### 2018 WSES / SIS-E consensus conference: recommendations for the management of skin and soft-tissue infections [^6d352cc9]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Necrotizing SSTIs (cellulitis, fasciitis, myositis, Fournier's gangrene) require surgical intervention including drainage and debridement of necrotic tissue in addition to antibiotic therapy.

Several authors and organizations have proposed classification schemes for SSTIs based on such variables as anatomic location, rate of progression, depth of extension, and clinical presentation or severity. Each has key limitations both in assisting clinical management and in providing guidance for developing new therapeutic agents.

The consensus concluded that the necrotizing or non-necrotizing character of the infection, the anatomical extension, the characteristics of the infection (purulent or non-purulent), and the clinical conditions of the patient should be always assessed independently to classify patients with soft-tissue infections.
