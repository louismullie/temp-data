## Question

For how many days do you give amoxil for acute otitis media

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how many days to give amoxicillin (Amoxil) for acute otitis media. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the patient's age and severity because duration is age- and severity-dependent. Then, I should verify what the AAP/AAFP guideline recommends for different age groups. Next, I will check the FDA labeling for any conflicting duration language. After that, I should review high-quality evidence, especially the NEJM trial in young children, to ensure I'm not overgeneralizing. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stewardship-aligned recommendation and note exceptions and follow-up expectations.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame: acute otitis media in children is managed differently by age and severity, and the duration of amoxicillin varies accordingly. The AAP/AAFP guideline explicitly recommends 10 days for children under 2 years or those with severe disease, 7 days for children 2–5 years with mild to moderate disease, and 5–7 days for children 6 years and older with mild to moderate disease, which I should anchor on before moving further [^51652fc0].

> Wait, let me verify the FDA labeling because I recall it sometimes says "until 48–72 hours after symptom resolution", which could be misread as a fixed duration. The FDA materials provide dosing and frequency but do not supersede guideline-directed duration; they emphasize continuing until 48–72 hours after symptom resolution, which is a stop rule rather than a fixed course length, so I should not interpret that as a blanket 5–7 day recommendation for all ages [^423e826f].

> Next, I should review the highest-quality evidence for the youngest children. The NEJM randomized trial in children 6–23 months showed that 5 days of amoxicillin–clavulanate was inferior to 10 days for clinical failure and symptom trajectories, reinforcing that 10 days is appropriate for children under 2 years; I need to ensure I don't extrapolate this to older children where shorter courses can be effective [^0cbe4867] [^b5433c00].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about older children. I should confirm that 5–7 day courses are supported in children 2 years and older. Observational and stewardship-focused data show similar outcomes with shorter courses in children 2 years and older, and contemporary pediatric stewardship literature supports 5–7 days for this group to reduce adverse effects and resistance pressure, which aligns with the AAP/AAFP guidance [^51652fc0] [^317c4b07] [^057be093].

> I will now examine adult dosing because the user might be asking about adults too. The FDA labeling provides adult dosing regimens and again uses the "continue until 48–72 hours after symptom resolution" stop rule rather than a fixed duration; in practice, many clinicians use 5–7 days for adults with uncomplicated AOM, but the label does not mandate a specific number of days, so I should be cautious and tailor to response and severity [^notfound].

> But wait, what if there are modifiers like recent antibiotics, bilateral disease, or otorrhea? I should double-check that these factors push toward longer or broader therapy. The AAP/AAFP guidance advises broader coverage and generally supports standard durations, with 10 days for severe disease or younger children, and it emphasizes reassessment at 48–72 hours if not improving, which I need to incorporate into the plan [^51652fc0] [^462cf5fd] [^d9844476].

> Let me synthesize a practical answer: for children under 2 years or with severe AOM, prescribe amoxicillin for 10 days. For children 2–5 years with mild to moderate AOM, 7 days is appropriate. For children 6 years and older with mild to moderate AOM, 5–7 days is sufficient. For adults, 5–7 days is reasonable, with the stop rule of continuing until 48–72 hours after symptom resolution guiding when to end therapy, and I should ensure follow-up if not improving by 48–72 hours [^51652fc0].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought the FDA might specify a uniform 7-day course, but I should correct that: the FDA provides dosing and a symptom-based stop rule, not a fixed duration, so I should not overstate a labeled duration where none exists. The AAP/AAFP age-stratified durations remain the evidence-based standard I should rely on [^51652fc0].

---

The standard duration of amoxicillin (Amoxil) for acute otitis media is **5–10 days**, tailored by age and severity [^51652fc0]. Use **10 days** for children under 2 years, children with severe symptoms, or bilateral disease; **7 days** for children 2–5 years with mild to moderate disease; and **5–7 days** for children 6 years and older with mild to moderate disease. Adults typically receive **5–7 days**. Treat for at least 48–72 hours after symptom resolution, and reassess if there is no improvement within 48–72 hours [^d9844476].

---

## Recommended duration of amoxicillin therapy

The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) provide **evidence-based recommendations** for the duration of amoxicillin therapy in pediatric AOM:

| **Age group and severity** | **Recommended duration** |
|-|-|
| Children < 2 years or severe symptoms (bilateral AOM, otorrhea, high fever) | 10 days |
| Children 2–5 years with mild to moderate symptoms | 7 days |
| Children ≥ 6 years with mild to moderate symptoms | 5–7 days |

---

These recommendations balance efficacy with the risks of adverse effects and antibiotic resistance; **shorter courses are appropriate for older children with milder disease**, whereas longer courses are reserved for younger children or those with more severe disease [^51652fc0].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting duration recommendations

- **Children < 2 years or severe disease**: A randomized controlled trial (RCT) showed that 10 days of amoxicillin-clavulanate significantly reduced treatment failure compared with 5 days in children 6–23 months, supporting a 10-day course for this group [^0cbe4867].
- **Children ≥ 2 years with mild to moderate disease**: Studies and reviews indicate that 5–7 days of amoxicillin is as effective as 10 days for older children with uncomplicated AOM, with fewer adverse effects and improved adherence [^notfound].
- **Adults**: Although pediatric data guide most recommendations, adults typically receive 5–7 days of amoxicillin, aligning with general principles of antibiotic stewardship and clinical response.

---

## Factors influencing duration of therapy

Several factors **influence the appropriate duration** of amoxicillin therapy:

- **Age**: Younger children generally require longer courses due to immature immune systems and higher recurrence risk.
- **Severity of symptoms**: Severe presentations (high fever, intense otalgia, bilateral disease, otorrhea) warrant longer therapy.
- **Recurrence**: Recent AOM episodes or frequent recurrences may necessitate extended treatment.
- **Patient-specific factors**: Immunocompromise, chronic illnesses, or anatomical abnormalities may require individualized duration adjustments.

---

## Clinical outcomes associated with different durations

Clinical studies consistently show that **shorter courses (5–7 days)** are effective for older children with mild to moderate AOM, with similar rates of clinical cure, recurrence, and complications compared with longer courses. However, for children under 2 years or with severe disease, shorter courses are associated with higher treatment failure rates, justifying the 10-day recommendation [^0cbe4867].

---

## Risks and benefits of shorter versus longer courses

Shorter courses (5–7 days) offer several advantages, including **reduced adverse effects** (gastrointestinal upset, rash, antibiotic-associated diarrhea), improved adherence, and lower risk of antibiotic resistance. Longer courses (10 days) may be necessary for certain patients to ensure complete bacterial eradication and prevent recurrence, albeit with increased risks of adverse effects and resistance.

---

## Special considerations and exceptions

- **Penicillin allergy**: Alternative antibiotics (e.g. cefdinir, azithromycin) are recommended for patients with documented penicillin allergy.
- **Treatment failure**: If no improvement occurs within 48–72 hours, reassess the diagnosis, consider antibiotic resistance, and adjust therapy accordingly [^d9844476].
- **Recurrent AOM**: Children with frequent recurrences may benefit from tympanostomy tubes or prophylactic antibiotics, with individualized duration decisions.

---

## Current clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Current AAP/AAFP guidelines emphasize **individualized duration** based on age, severity, and patient-specific factors, with a strong recommendation for 10 days in children under 2 years or with severe disease. Expert consensus supports shorter courses for older children with mild to moderate disease, aligning with antibiotic stewardship principles [^51652fc0].

---

## Practical clinical recommendations

- **Children < 2 years or severe disease**: 10 days of amoxicillin.
- **Children 2–5 years with mild to moderate disease**: 7 days of amoxicillin.
- **Children ≥ 6 years with mild to moderate disease**: 5–7 days of amoxicillin.
- **Adults**: 5–7 days of amoxicillin.
- **Reassess**: If no improvement within 48–72 hours, reassess and adjust therapy [^d9844476].

---

The duration of amoxicillin therapy for acute otitis media **varies by age and severity**, with 5–10 days recommended. Shorter courses are appropriate for older children with mild disease, while longer courses are necessary for younger children or those with severe disease.

### Once or twice daily versus three times daily amoxicillin with or without clavulanate for the treatment of acute otitis media [^50ec338d]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Acute otitis media (AOM) is a common problem in children, for which amoxicillin, with or without clavulanate, is frequently prescribed as a treatment of choice. The conventional recommendation is either three or four daily doses. However, nowadays it is frequently prescribed as once or twice daily doses. If once or twice daily amoxicillin, with or without clavulanate, is as effective for acute otitis media as three or four times a day, it may be more convenient to give the medication once or twice a day to children and hence improve compliance.

Objectives

To compare the effectiveness of one or two daily doses with three or four daily doses of amoxicillin, with or without clavulanate, for the treatment of AOM in children; and to compare complication rates and adverse reactions.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL 2013, Issue 2, MEDLINE (January 1950 to March week 1, 2013), EMBASE (1974 to March 2013) and the Science Citation Index (2001 to March 2013).

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of children aged 12 years or younger with AOM, diagnosed by acute ear pain (otalgia) and inflamed ear drum (confirmed by positive tympanocentesis or tympanogram of type B or C).

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data on treatment outcomes from individual trials and assessed trial quality based on selection bias, performance bias and detection bias, attrition bias, reporting bias and other biases. We defined the quality grading as low risk of bias, high risk of bias or unclear risk of bias. We summarised the results as risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

We included five studies with 1601 children in the review. Pooled analysis demonstrated that the following outcomes were comparable between the two groups: clinical cure at the end of therapy (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.07); during therapy (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.33) and at follow-up (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.09); recurrent AOM (RR 1.21, 95% CI 0.52 to 2.81); compliance rate (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.10) and overall adverse events (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.63). When we performed subgroup analysis separately for trials with amoxicillin only and amoxicillin/clavulanate only, it showed that all important outcomes were comparable between once or twice daily groups and the three times daily group. The risk of bias amongst the five included studies was as follows: for random sequence generation we graded two studies as low and three unclear risk of bias; for allocation concealment all studies were at unclear risk of bias; for blinding (performance and detection bias) we graded four as high and one as unclear risk of bias; for incomplete outcome data (attrition bias) we graded two low, two high and one as unclear risk of bias; for reporting bias four were at low and one at high risk; and for 'other' bias four were at low and one at unclear risk of bias.

Authors' Conclusions

This review showed that the results of using once or twice daily doses of amoxicillin, with or without clavulanate, were comparable with three doses for the treatment of AOM.

### Antibiotics for acute otitis media in children [^c81573d5]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute otitis media (AOM) is one of the most common diseases in childhood for which antibiotics are commonly prescribed; a systematic review reported a pooled prevalence of 85.6% in high-income countries. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in the Cochrane Library in 1997 and updated in 1999, 2005, 2009, 2013 and 2015.

Objectives

To assess the effects of antibiotics for children with AOM.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Current Contents, CINAHL, LILACS and two trial registers. The date of the search was 14 February 2023.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials comparing 1) antimicrobial drugs with placebo, and 2) immediate antibiotic treatment with expectant observation (including delayed antibiotic prescribing) in children with AOM.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened trials for inclusion and extracted data using the standard methodological procedures recommended by Cochrane. Our primary outcomes were: 1) pain at various time points (24 hours, two to three days, four to seven days, 10 to 14 days), and 2) adverse effects likely to be related to the use of antibiotics. Secondary outcomes were: 1) abnormal tympanometry findings, 2) tympanic membrane perforation, 3) contralateral otitis (in unilateral cases), 4) AOM recurrences, 5) serious complications related to AOM and 6) long-term effects (including the number of parent-reported AOM symptom episodes, antibiotic prescriptions and health care utilisation as assessed at least one year after randomisation). We used the GRADE approach to rate the overall certainty of evidence for each outcome of interest.

Main Results

Antibiotics versus placebo We included 13 trials (3401 children and 3938 AOM episodes) from high-income countries, which we assessed at generally low risk of bias. Antibiotics do not reduce pain at 24 hours (risk ratio (RR) 0.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.78 to 1.01; 5 trials, 1394 children; high-certainty evidence), or at four to seven days (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.14; 7 trials, 1264 children), but result in almost a third fewer children having pain at two to three days (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.88; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 20; 7 trials, 2320 children; high-certainty evidence), and likely result in two-thirds fewer having pain at 10 to 12 days (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.66; NNTB 7; 1 trial, 278 children; moderate-certainty evidence). Antibiotics increase the risk of adverse events such as vomiting, diarrhoea or rash (RR 1.38, 95% CI 1.16 to 1.63; number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) 14; 8 trials, 2107 children; high-certainty evidence). Antibiotics reduce the risk of children having abnormal tympanometry findings at two to four weeks (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.96; NNTB 11; 7 trials, 2138 children), slightly reduce the risk of experiencing tympanic membrane perforations (RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.89; NNTB 33; 5 trials, 1075 children) and halve the risk of contralateral otitis episodes (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.95; NNTB 11; 4 trials, 906 children). However, antibiotics do not reduce the risk of abnormal tympanometry findings at six to eight weeks (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.13; 3 trials, 953 children) and at three months (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.34; 3 trials, 809 children) or late AOM recurrences (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.11; 6 trials, 2200 children). Severe complications were rare, and the evidence suggests that serious complications do not differ between children treated with either antibiotics or placebo. Immediate antibiotics versus expectant observation We included six trials (1556 children) from high-income countries. The evidence suggests that immediate antibiotics may result in a reduction of pain at two to three days (RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.79; NNTB 8; 1 trial, 396 children; low-certainty evidence), but probably do not reduce the risk of pain at three to seven days (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.12; 4 trials, 959 children; moderate-certainty evidence), and may not reduce the risk of pain at 11 to 14 days (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.10; 1 trial, 247 children; low-certainty evidence). Immediate antibiotics increase the risk of vomiting, diarrhoea or rash (RR 1.87, 95% CI 1.39 to 2.51; NNTH 10; 3 trials, 946 children; high-certainty evidence). Immediate antibiotics probably do not reduce the proportion of children with abnormal tympanometry findings at four weeks and evidence suggests that immediate antibiotics may not reduce the risk of tympanic membrane perforation and AOM recurrences. No serious complications occurred in either group.

Authors' Conclusions

This review reveals that antibiotics probably have no effect on pain at 24 hours, a slight effect on pain in the days following and only a modest effect on the number of children with tympanic perforations, contralateral otitis episodes and abnormal tympanometry findings at two to four weeks compared with placebo in children with AOM. In high-income countries, most cases of AOM spontaneously remit without complications. The benefits of antibiotics must be weighed against the possible harms: for every 14 children treated with antibiotics, one child experienced an adverse event (such as vomiting, diarrhoea or rash) that would not have occurred if antibiotics were withheld. For most children with mild disease in high-income countries, an expectant observational approach seems justified. Therefore, clinical management should emphasise advice about adequate analgesia and the limited role for antibiotics.

### Treatment of acute otitis media consensus recommendations [^1656a28d]. Clinical Pediatrics (2002). Low credibility.

The objective of this paper is to provide consensus recommendations for the management of acute otitis media (AOM) that pediatricians can incorporate into their daily practices. These recommendations were developed during a roundtable meeting that convened clinicians versed in the management of AOM. This meeting was sponsored by an educational grant from SmithKline Beecham Pharmaceuticals. In addition, clinical studies on AOM identified via MEDLINE search were considered in the development of these recommendations. The Drug-Resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae Therapeutic Working Group guidelines for the management of AOM are reviewed in detail. All of the articles identified from the data sources were evaluated and all information deemed relevant was included in this review. AOM is one of the most common infectious diseases affecting infants and children and one of the leading causes of office visits and antibiotic prescriptions for this population. The incidence of AOM has increased during the past 25 years, probably the result of an increased utilization of day care facilities in the United States. The predominant pathogens in AOM include S. pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. The high prevalence of drug-resistant S. pneumoniae and beta-lactamase-producing organisms presents a clinical challenge for practitioners in the selection of empiric antimicrobial therapy. Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic principles should be considered in addition to minimum inhibitory concentrations in selecting antibiotics for AOM. Amoxicillin at conventional or high doses (80–90 mg/kg/day) remains an appropriate choice for first-line therapy for AOM. For patients in whom amoxicillin is unsuccessful, second-line therapy should have demonstrated activity against penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae as well as beta-lactamase-producing pathogens. Appropriate options for second-line therapy include high-dose amoxicillin/clavulanate (90 mg/kg/day based on the amoxicillin component) and ceftriaxone. Cefuroxime has been suggested as a second-line agent in the past, but recent surveillance data suggest it may no longer be active against penicillin-resistant strains of S. pneumoniae. Tympanocentesis is useful for identifying the causative pathogen, and it may be beneficial for patients who have failed multiple courses of antibiotics. The pneumococcal conjugate vaccine recently was approved for use in children and should be administered to all children less than 2 years old and those at risk for recurrent AOM (e.g., day care attendance, siblings with a history of recurrent AOM). Consensus recommendations are provided for the management of AOM, with a focus on antimicrobial therapy. The current challenges in the management of AOM include the need for an increased understanding of epidemiology, increasing resistance among common middle ear pathogens, use of pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic principles in designing treatment strategies, and understanding the potential impact of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine.

### Short-course antibiotics for acute otitis media [^605694b9]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Acute otitis media (AOM) is a common illness during childhood, for which antibiotics are frequently prescribed.

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness of a short course of antibiotics (less than seven days) in comparison to a long course of antibiotics (seven days or greater) for the treatment of AOM in children.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2009, issue 4) which contains the Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialised Register, MEDLINE, EMBASE, MEDLINE In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, CINAHL, BIOSIS Previews, OCLC Papers First and Proceedings First, Proquest Dissertations and Theses (inception to November 2009); International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, the NLM Gateway, ClinicalTrials.gov and Current Controlled Trials (inception to August 2008).

Selection Criteria

Trials were included if they met the following criteria: participants aged one month to 18 years; clinical diagnosis of ear infection; no previous antimicrobial therapy; and randomisation to treatment with less than seven days versus seven days or more of antibiotics.

Data Collection and Analysis

The primary outcome of treatment failure was defined as the absence of clinical resolution, relapse or recurrence of AOM during one month following initiation of therapy. Treatment outcomes were extracted from individual studies and combined in the form of a summary odds ratio (OR). A summary OR of 1.0 indicates that the treatment failure rate following less than seven days of antibiotic treatment was similar to the failure rate following seven days or more of treatment.

Main Results

This update included 49 trials containing 12,045 participants. Risk of treatment failure was higher with short courses of antibiotics (OR 1.34, 95% CI 1.15 to 1.55) at one month after initiation of therapy (21% failure with short-course treatment and 18% with long-course; absolute difference of 3% between groups). There were no differences found when examining treatment with ceftriaxone for less than seven days (30% failure in those receiving ceftriaxone and 27% in short-acting antibiotics administered for seven days or more) or azithromycin for less than seven days (18% failure in both those receiving azithromycin and short-acting antibiotics administered for seven days or more) with respect to risk of treatment failure at one month or less. Significant reductions in gastrointestinal adverse events were observed for treatment with short-acting antibiotics and azithromycin.

Authors' Conclusions

Clinicians need to evaluate whether the minimal short-term benefit from longer treatment of antibiotics is worth exposing children to a longer course of antibiotics.

### Once or twice daily versus three times daily amoxicillin with or without clavulanate for the treatment of acute otitis media [^35a5a3b0]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Acute otitis media (AOM) is a common problem in children, for which the antibiotic amoxicillin, with or without clavulanate, is frequently prescribed.

Objectives

To compare the effectiveness of one or two daily doses with three or four daily doses of amoxicillin, with or without clavulanate, for the treatment of AOM in children.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2008, issue 1), which contains the Acute Respiratory Infections (ARI) Group's Specialized Register; MEDLINE (January 1950 to March 2008); EMBASE (1974 to March 2008); the Science Citation Index (2001 to March 2008); and NLM Gateway (HSRProj) (March 2008).

Selection Criteria

We included studies if they met the following criteria: randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of children aged 12 years or younger with AOM, diagnosed by the following explicit criteria: acute ear pain (otalgia) and inflamed ear drum (confirmed by positive tympanocentesis or tympanogram of type B or C).

Data Collection and Analysis

We extracted data on treatment outcomes from individual trials. We assessed quality based on selection bias, performance bias, attrition bias and sample size calculation. The quality grading was defined as low risk of bias, moderate risk of bias or high risk of bias. The results were summarized as risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

We included six studies with 1601 children in the review. Although the clinical cure rates at the end of therapy and at the follow-up periods of each study were shown to be comparable between the two groups, we did not perform pooled data analysis because of moderate to high risk of biases in the included studies. Most of the children were aged 2 months to 12 years. None of the studies had any consistently significant results either for benefit or harm. The outcomes were assessed at the end of therapy (often 10 days) and this may have been too late to measure any differences.

Authors' Conclusions

This review showed insufficient evidence to judge whether once or twice daily doses of amoxicillin, with or without clavulanate, were comparable with three or four daily doses for the treatment of AOM. The evidence appears to be biased and therefore no firm conclusions can be drawn.

### The diagnosis and management of acute otitis media [^ab8bd3e3]. Pediatrics (2013). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis media (AOM) — antibiotic choice and comparative trial design — notes that amoxicillin-clavulanate has a broader spectrum than amoxicillin and may be a better initial antibiotic; however, because of cost and adverse effects, the subcommittee has chosen amoxicillin as first-line AOM treatment. For head-to-head comparisons, stringent diagnostic criteria should be the standard for these studies, antibiotic comparisons for AOM should now include an observation arm for patients with nonsevere illness to ensure a clinical benefit over placebo, and studies should also have enough patients to show small but meaningful differences. Additional research is needed to determine whether risk factors such as child care settings and siblings younger than 5 years indicate a need for different initial treatment, to develop new antibiotics that are safe and effective and test them against the currently available medications, and to conduct randomized controlled trials using different durations of antibiotic therapy in different age groups to optimize therapy with the possibility of decreasing duration of antibiotic use, which would need to be performed initially with amoxicillin and amoxicillin-clavulanate and again include an observation arm in nonsevere illness.

### The diagnosis and management of acute otitis media [^610177b2]. Pediatrics (2013). Medium credibility.

Key action statement 4A — For acute otitis media (AOM), clinicians should prescribe amoxicillin for AOM when a decision to treat with antibiotics has been made and the child has not received amoxicillin in the past 30 days or the child does not have concurrent purulent conjunctivitis or the child is not allergic to penicillin (Evidence Quality: Grade B, Rec. Strength: Recommendation); benefits include that amoxicillin is effective for most children with AOM and is inexpensive, safe, has acceptable taste, and a narrow antimicrobial spectrum, while risks include ineffectiveness against β-lactamase–producing organisms and adverse effects of amoxicillin, with a preponderance of benefit noted; exclusions include patients with known penicillin allergy, and clinicians must determine whether the patient is truly penicillin allergic, with patient preferences considered if there was previous bad experience with amoxicillin.

### High-dose versus standard-dose amoxicillin for acute otitis media [^91c25af4]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Emergence of drug-resistant bacteria has led to a recommendation to use high-dose (HD) amoxicillin (80–90 mg/kg/d) rather than standard-dose (SD) amoxicillin (40–45 mg/kg/d) to treat children with acute otitis media (AOM).

Objective

To compare the efficacy and tolerability of HD versus SD amoxicillin among children with AOM who were considered at low risk for infection with antibiotic-resistant bacteria.

Methods

A double-blind, randomized, 3-year clinical trial was conducted using participants who met the following criteria: age > 3 mo, weight ≤ 18 kg, diagnosed with AOM, and candidates for treatment with amoxicillin. The primary endpoint was treatment success at a 3- to 4-day follow-up visit based on the clinical decision to continue the prescribed antibiotic therapy for AOM. Other endpoints included duration of illness, number of office visits and telephone calls related to illness, total number of subsequent AOM episodes, and number of adverse effects.

Results

The absolute difference in antibiotic failure rate with SD versus HD amoxicillin at the follow-up visit was nonsignificant (95% CI -1.5% to 3.4%; p = 0.78). The mean duration of illness was similar for both doses of amoxicillin (3 ± 2 d). The number of office visits and telephone calls related to illness and the number of subsequent AOM episodes did not differ between the 2 treatment groups. HD amoxicillin did not result in a greater incidence of adverse effects than SD amoxicillin.

Conclusions

HD amoxicillin had neither benefit nor detriment compared with SD for AOM in children at low risk for infection with antibiotic-resistant bacteria.

### The diagnosis and management of acute otitis media [^361eed2e]. Pediatrics (2013). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis media — first-line antibiotic therapy and dosing: High-dose amoxicillin is recommended as the first-line treatment in most patients, with amoxicillin 80–90 mg/kg per day in 2 divided doses as the recommended first-line regimen. In children who have taken amoxicillin in the previous 30 days, those with concurrent conjunctivitis, or those for whom coverage for β-lactamase–positive Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis is desired, therapy should be initiated with high-dose amoxicillin-clavulanate, specified as 90 mg/kg/day of amoxicillin with 6.4 mg/kg/day of clavulanate (amoxicillin to clavulanate ratio 14:1) given in 2 divided doses.

### Current approaches to otitis media [^20f99aab]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Acute otitis media is the most commonly diagnosed illness in children, and is one of the most common reasons for antibiotic prescription. In many countries, antibiotic resistance is increasing among the bacteria that are implicated in acute otitis media, particularly Streptococcus pneumoniae. This evolution should stimulate changes in the management of acute otitis media, particularly the following: improvement in diagnostic accuracy; reduction in antibiotic use; selection of the most appropriate drugs at the appropriate dosage; reduction in duration of treatment, when possible; and implementation of new vaccines.

### Antibiotics for acute otitis media in children [^5276bbf3]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Acute otitis media (AOM) is one of the most common diseases in early infancy and childhood. Antibiotic use for AOM varies from 56% in the Netherlands to 95% in the USA, Canada and Australia. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in The Cochrane Library in Issue 1, 1997 and previously updated in 1999, 2005, 2009 and 2013.

Objectives

To assess the effects of antibiotics for children with AOM.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL (2015, Issue 3), MEDLINE (1966 to April week 3, 2015), OLDMEDLINE (1958 to 1965), EMBASE (January 1990 to April 2015), Current Contents (1966 to April 2015), CINAHL (2008 to April 2015) and LILACS (2008 to April 2015).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing 1) antimicrobial drugs with placebo and 2) immediate antibiotic treatment with expectant observation (including delayed antibiotic prescribing) in children with AOM.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data.

Main Results

For the review of antibiotics against placebo, 13 RCTs (3401 children and 3938 AOM episodes) from high-income countries were eligible and had generally low risk of bias. The combined results of the trials revealed that by 24 hours from the start of treatment, 60% of the children had recovered whether or not they had placebo or antibiotics. Pain was not reduced by antibiotics at 24 hours (risk ratio (RR) 0.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.78 to 1.01) but almost a third fewer had residual pain at two to three days (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.86; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 20). A quarter fewer had pain at four to seven days (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.91; NNTB 16) and two-thirds fewer had pain at 10 to 12 days (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.66; NNTB 7) compared with placebo. Antibiotics did reduce the number of children with abnormal tympanometry findings at two to four weeks (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.90; NNTB 11), at six to eight weeks (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.00; NNTB 16) and the number of children with tympanic membrane perforations (RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.76; NNTB 33) and halved contralateral otitis episodes (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.95; NNTB 11) compared with placebo. However, antibiotics neither reduced the number of children with abnormal tympanometry findings at three months (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.24) nor the number of children with late AOM recurrences (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.10) when compared with placebo. Severe complications were rare and did not differ between children treated with antibiotics and those treated with placebo. Adverse events (such as vomiting, diarrhoea or rash) occurred more often in children taking antibiotics (RR 1.38, 95% CI 1.19 to 1.59; number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) 14). Funnel plots do not suggest publication bias. Individual patient data meta-analysis of a subset of included trials found antibiotics to be most beneficial in children aged less than two years with bilateral AOM, or with both AOM and otorrhoea. For the review of immediate antibiotics against expectant observation, five trials (1149 children) from high-income countries were eligible and had low to moderate risk of bias. Four trials (1007 children) reported outcome data that could be used for this review. From these trials, data from 959 children could be extracted for the meta-analysis of pain at three to seven days. No difference in pain was detectable at three to seven days (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.12). One trial (247 children) reported data on pain at 11 to 14 days. Immediate antibiotics were not associated with a reduction in the number of children with pain (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.10) compared with expectant observation. Additionally, no differences in the number of children with abnormal tympanometry findings at four weeks, tympanic membrane perforations and AOM recurrence were observed between groups. No serious complications occurred in either the antibiotic or the expectant observation group. Immediate antibiotics were associated with a substantial increased risk of vomiting, diarrhoea or rash compared with expectant observation (RR 1.71, 95% CI 1.24 to 2.36; NNTH 9). Results from an individual patient data meta-analysis including data from six high-quality trials (1643 children) that were also included as individual trials in our review showed that antibiotics seem to be most beneficial in children younger than two years of age with bilateral AOM (NNTB 4) and in children with both AOM and otorrhoea (NNTB 3).

Authors' Conclusions

This review reveals that antibiotics have no early effect on pain, a slight effect on pain in the days following and only a modest effect on the number of children with tympanic perforations, contralateral otitis episodes and abnormal tympanometry findings at two to four weeks and at six to eight weeks compared with placebo in children with AOM. In high-income countries, most cases of AOM spontaneously remit without complications. The benefits of antibiotics must be weighed against the possible harms: for every 14 children treated with antibiotics one child experienced an adverse event (such as vomiting, diarrhoea or rash) that would not have occurred if antibiotics were withheld. Therefore clinical management should emphasise advice about adequate analgesia and the limited role for antibiotics. Antibiotics are most useful in children under two years of age with bilateral AOM, or with both AOM and otorrhoea. For most other children with mild disease in high-income countries, an expectant observational approach seems justified.

### Durations of antibiotic treatment for acute otitis media and variability in prescribed durations across two large academic health systems [^3edc4e79]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2024). Medium credibility.

The observed infrequent use of 5-day durations was remarkably similar between the two health systems and across all types of care locations. Although there was variability in prescribed durations among individual clinicians, most tended to prescribe longer durations. It was noteworthy that a small subset of clinicians tended to prescribe shorter durations (mean 5–7 days). Such clinicians may be particularly useful for antibiotic stewardship programs to engage, both to help champion interventions to promote shorter durations of therapy and to demonstrate the feasibility of changing prescribing behavior. This finding also highlights the potential utility of feeding back data to clinicians on their prescribed durations of therapy in comparison to their peers as a method of driving change in prescribing behavior.

Shortening the duration of antibiotic prescriptions for AOM could significantly impact rates of antibiotic resistance and adverse drug events. Studies of community-acquired pneumonia in children have shown that 5-day durations of amoxicillin are associated with less frequent colonization with antibiotic-resistant bacteria as compared to 10-day durations. An observational study in Israeli children with AOM demonstrated that middle ear fluid samples had lower rates of pneumococcal resistance in seasons with lower antibiotic prescription rates as compared to seasons with high antibiotic prescription rates. Parent-reported adverse drug events are common among children who receive antibiotics (25–36%) and are more frequent among children who receive longer versus shorter durations. These findings highlight the potential for future outpatient antimicrobial stewardship efforts to reduce unintended consequences of antibiotics through shortening treatment durations.

### The diagnosis and management of acute otitis media [^51652fc0]. Pediatrics (2013). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis media (AOM) duration of therapy by age and severity: The optimal duration is uncertain, but for children younger than 2 years and children with severe symptoms, a standard 10-day course is recommended. A 7-day course appears equally effective in children 2 to 5 years of age with mild or moderate AOM, and for children 6 years and older with mild to moderate symptoms, a 5- to 7-day course is adequate treatment.

### Pediatric acute otitis media: the case for delayed antibiotic treatment [^564023c4]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Acute otitis media (AOM) is both a commonly diagnosed condition and a frequent indication for antibiotic use in children. Recent literature suggests that antibiotics are not needed in many children with AOM, as most cases resolve spontaneously without complication. However, a majority of AOM infections in children are still treated with antibiotics. The American Academy of Pediatrics and American Academy of Family Physicians released a guideline for treatment of AOM in children. We review the guideline as well as scientific evidence related to AOM treatment options. We support a set of evidence-based guidelines employing a delayed prescription option for antibiotic therapy in selected children. If used appropriately, these cost-effective guidelines will reduce the amount of antibiotics prescribed, increase parental satisfaction, and may lower rates of antibiotic resistance while producing similar rates of resolution of AOM.

### Evidence assessment of management of acute otitis media: I. the role of antibiotics in treatment of uncomplicated acute otitis media [^ca02a8d5]. Pediatrics (2001). Low credibility.

Context

In 1995, > 5 million episodes of acute otitis media (AOM) accounted for $3 billion in health care expenditures.

Objectives

To synthesize the literature on the natural history of AOM, the effectiveness of antibiotic treatment in uncomplicated AOM, and the relative effectiveness of specific antibiotic regimens.

Data Sources

Seven electronic databases for articles published between 1966 and March 1999 and reference lists in proceedings, published articles, reports, and guidelines.

Study Selection

Two physicians independently assessed each article. Studies addressing AOM in children 4 weeks to 18 years old were included; those addressing children with immunodeficiencies or craniofacial abnormalities were excluded. Randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) were used to assess antibiotic effectiveness, and RCTs and cohort studies were used to assess the natural history of AOM. Among the 3491 citations identified, 80 (2.3%) met our inclusion criteria.

Data Extraction

Two physicians independently abstracted data and assessed the quality of studies using a validated scale for RCTs and 8 quality components for cohort studies.

Data Synthesis

Random-effects estimates of pooled absolute rate differences of outcomes were derived, and heterogeneity of both the rates and rate differences was assessed. Children with AOM not treated with antibiotics experienced a 1- to 7-day clinical failure rate of 19% (95% confidence interval: 0.10–0.28) and few suppurative complications. When patients were treated with amoxicillin, the 2- to 7-day clinical failure rate was reduced to 7%, a 12% (95% confidence interval: 0.04–0.20) reduction. Adverse effects, primarily gastrointestinal, were more common among children on cefixime than among those on ampicillin or amoxicillin. They were also more common among children on amoxicillin-clavulanate than among those on azithromycin.

Conclusions

The majority of uncomplicated cases of AOM resolve spontaneously without apparent suppurative complications. Ampicillin or amoxicillin confers a limited therapeutic benefit. There is no evidence to support any particular antibiotic regimens as more effective at relieving symptoms. Certain antibiotics are more likely than others to cause diarrhea and other adverse events.

### Durations of antibiotic treatment for acute otitis media and variability in prescribed durations across two large academic health systems [^317c4b07]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2024). Medium credibility.

BACKGROUND

Antibiotic resistance is a global health threat, fueled by overuse and misuse of antibiotics. Unnecessary antibiotic use contributes to adverse drug events such as rash, diarrhea, and abdominal pain, and contributes to almost 70 000 emergency department visits in children annually. Each excess day of antibiotic prescribed has been associated with a 5% increase in the odds of antibiotic-associated adverse events.

Acute otitis media (AOM) affects approximately 5 million children in the United States annually and accounts for roughly 25% of all antibiotics prescribed to children each year. Therefore, understanding prescribing habits for AOM is essential to developing effective strategies to reduce overall pediatric antibiotic use. Studies suggest that for most children with uncomplicated AOM (defined as AOM without otorrhea), the risk of treatment failure does not differ between those who receive 5 days of therapy and those who receive 7 or more days of therapy. Additionally, 5-day regimens provide similar rates of clinical cure and bacterial eradication for children ages 2 years and older compared to traditional 10-day regimens. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) AOM guidelines published in 2013 recommend short (5–7 day) durations for children ages 2 years and older with nonsevere and uncomplicated AOM. Despite these recommendations, most children with AOM receive longer (10 day) antibiotic durations. These prior studies were either performed in single centers and may not be generalizable or using large insurance claims databases and unable to provide a granular level of detail to identify potential interventions to promote more widespread use of short treatment durations and first-line antibiotics.

The aims of this study were to evaluate durations of therapy prescribed for children 2 years and older with uncomplicated AOM across the ambulatory care systems of two, large pediatric academic health systems and to assess the variability in prescribed durations between and within the systems, from the individual to the institutional level. We additionally evaluated proportions of nonfirst-line antibiotic use and clinical outcomes such as treatment failure, AOM recurrence, and mastoiditis.

Acute otitis media — antibiotic selection and reassessment: Clinicians should prescribe amoxicillin for AOM when a decision to treat with antibiotics has been made and the child has not received amoxicillin in the past 30 days or the child does not have concurrent purulent conjunctivitis, or the child is not allergic to penicillin; clinicians should prescribe an antibiotic with additional β-lactamase coverage for AOM when a decision to treat with antibiotics has been made, and the child has received amoxicillin in the last 30 days or has concurrent purulent conjunctivitis, or has a history of recurrent AOM unresponsive to amoxicillin; clinicians should reassess the patient if the caregiver reports that the child's symptoms have worsened or failed to respond to the initial antibiotic treatment within 48 to 72 hours and determine whether a change in therapy is needed.

### Amoxicillin versus other antibiotic agents for the treatment of acute otitis media in children [^3e923d51]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The objective of the study was to compare the antibiotic treatment failure and recurrence rates between antibiotic agents (amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, cefdinir, and azithromycin) for children with uncomplicated acute otitis media (AOM).

Study Design

We completed a retrospective cohort study of children 6 months-12 years of age with uncomplicated AOM identified in a nationwide claims database. The primary exposure was the antibiotic agent, and the primary outcomes were treatment failure and recurrence. Logistic regression was used to estimate ORs, and analyses were stratified by primary exposure, patient age, and antibiotic duration.

Results

Among the 1051007 children included in the analysis, 56.6% were prescribed amoxicillin, 13.5% were prescribed amoxicillin-clavulanate, 20.6% were prescribed cefdinir, and 9.3% were prescribed azithromycin. Most prescriptions (93%) were for 10 days, and 98% were filled within 1 day of the medical encounter. Treatment failure and recurrence occurred in 2.2% (95% CI: 2.1, 2.2) and 3.3% (3.2, 3.3) of children, respectively. Combined failure and recurrence rates were low for all agents including amoxicillin (1.7%; 1.7, 1.8), amoxicillin-clavulanate (11.3%; 11.1, 11.5), cefdinir (10.0%; 9.8, 10.1), and azithromycin (9.8%; 9.6, 10.0).

Conclusions

Despite microbiologic changes in AOM etiology, treatment failure and recurrence were uncommon for all antibiotic agents and were lower for amoxicillin than for other agents. These findings support the continued use of amoxicillin as a first-line agent for AOM when antibiotics are prescribed.

Main Results

For the review of antibiotics against placebo, 12 RCTs (3317 children and 3854 AOM episodes) from high-income countries were eligible. However, one trial did not report patient-relevant outcomes, leaving 11 trials with generally low risk of bias. Pain was not reduced by antibiotics at 24 hours (risk ratio (RR) 0.89; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.78 to 1.01) but almost a third fewer had residual pain at two to three days (RR 0.70; 95% CI 0.57 to 0.86; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 20) and fewer had pain at four to seven days (RR 0.79; 95% CI 0.66 to 0.95; NNTB 20). When compared with placebo, antibiotics did not alter the number of abnormal tympanometry findings at either four to six weeks (RR 0.92; 95% CI 0.83 to 1.01) or at three months (RR 0.97; 95% CI 0.76 to 1.24), or the number of AOM recurrences (RR 0.93; 95% CI 0.78 to 1.10). However, antibiotic treatment did lead to a statistically significant reduction of tympanic membrane perforations (RR 0.37; 95% CI 0.18 to 0.76; NNTB 33) and halved contralateral AOM episodes (RR 0.49; 95% CI 0.25 to 0.95; NNTB 11) as compared with placebo. Severe complications were rare and did not differ between children treated with antibiotics and those treated with placebo.

From these trials, data from 959 children could be extracted for the meta-analysis on pain at days three to seven. No difference in pain was detectable at three to seven days (RR 0.75; 95% CI 0.50 to 1.12). No serious complications occurred in either the antibiotic group or the expectant observation group. Additionally, no difference in tympanic membrane perforations and AOM recurrence was observed. Immediate antibiotic prescribing was associated with a substantial increased risk of vomiting, diarrhoea or rash as compared with expectant observation (RR 1.71; 95% CI 1.24 to 2.36).

Authors' Conclusions

Antibiotic treatment led to a statistically significant reduction of children with AOM experiencing pain at two to seven days compared with placebo but since most children (82%) settle spontaneously, about 20 children must be treated to prevent one suffering from ear pain at two to seven days. Additionally, antibiotic treatment led to a statistically significant reduction of tympanic membrane perforations (NNTB 33) and contralateral AOM episodes (NNTB 11). These benefits must be weighed against the possible harms: for every 14 children treated with antibiotics, one child experienced an adverse event (such as vomiting, diarrhoea or rash) that would not have occurred if antibiotics had been withheld. Antibiotics appear to be most useful in children under two years of age with bilateral AOM, or with both AOM and otorrhoea. For most other children with mild disease, an expectant observational approach seems justified. We have no trials in populations with higher risks of complications.

### Diagnosis and treatment of acute otitis media: evaluating the evidence [^0da32aa3]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

Acute otitis media (AOM) is one of the most common illnesses for which children in the United States receive an antimicrobial agent. Of the six recommendations offered in recent guidelines for treatment of AOM, only one, the assessment and treatment of pain with analgesics, is based on strong evidence. This article reviews the diagnosis of AOM and the accuracy of various signs and symptoms in indicating a bacterial origin, the data on the effect of antimicrobial agents compared with placebo in the treatment of AOM, and the gaps in knowledge that should be addressed by future research and clinical trials.

### A placebo-controlled trial of antimicrobial treatment for acute otitis media [^762da0e2]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2011). Excellent credibility.

Background

The efficacy of antimicrobial treatment in children with acute otitis media remains controversial.

Methods

In this randomized, double-blind trial, children 6 to 35 months of age with acute otitis media, diagnosed with the use of strict criteria, received amoxicillin-clavulanate (161 children) or placebo (158 children) for 7 days. The primary outcome was the time to treatment failure from the first dose until the end-of-treatment visit on day 8. The definition of treatment failure was based on the overall condition of the child (including adverse events) and otoscopic signs of acute otitis media.

Results

Treatment failure occurred in 18.6% of the children who received amoxicillin-clavulanate, as compared with 44.9% of the children who received placebo (P < 0.001). The difference between the groups was already apparent at the first scheduled visit (day 3), at which time 13.7% of the children who received amoxicillin-clavulanate, as compared with 25.3% of those who received placebo, had treatment failure. Overall, amoxicillin-clavulanate reduced the progression to treatment failure by 62% (hazard ratio, 0.38; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.25 to 0.59; P < 0.001) and the need for rescue treatment by 81% (6.8% vs. 33.5%; hazard ratio, 0.19; 95% CI, 0.10 to 0.36; P < 0.001). Analgesic or antipyretic agents were given to 84.2% and 85.9% of the children in the amoxicillin-clavulanate and placebo groups, respectively. Adverse events were significantly more common in the amoxicillin-clavulanate group than in the placebo group. A total of 47.8% of the children in the amoxicillin-clavulanate group had diarrhea, as compared with 26.6% in the placebo group (P < 0.001); 8.7% and 3.2% of the children in the respective groups had eczema (P = 0.04).

Conclusions

Children with acute otitis media benefit from antimicrobial treatment as compared with placebo, although they have more side effects. Future studies should identify patients who may derive the greatest benefit, in order to minimize unnecessary antimicrobial treatment and the development of bacterial resistance.

### The diagnosis and management of acute otitis media [^c25ae103]. Pediatrics (2013). Medium credibility.

Initial antibiotic treatment failure in AOM — monitoring and next steps are as follows: When antibiotics are prescribed, clinical improvement should be noted within 48 to 72 hours; during the 24 hours after diagnosis symptoms may worsen slightly, then should begin to improve in the next 24 hours, and if initially febrile, temperature should decline within 48 to 72 hours. If the patient is not improved by 48 to 72 hours, reassess for another disease, concomitant viral infection, or resistance. Evidence on clinical–bacteriologic correlation is mixed, with some studies reporting good correlation ranging from 86% to 91% and others reporting sterile middle ear fluid in 42% to 49% of cases. A change in antibiotic may not be required in some children with mild persistent symptoms; however, in children with persistent, severe symptoms and unimproved otologic findings after initial treatment, the clinician may consider changing the antibiotic. If initially treated with amoxicillin and failed to improve, amoxicillin-clavulanate should be used; patients previously given amoxicillin-clavulanate or oral third-generation cephalosporins may receive intramuscular ceftriaxone (50 mg/kg), and in AOM unresponsive to initial antibiotics, a 3-day course of ceftriaxone has been shown to be better than a 1-day regimen.

### The diagnosis and management of acute otitis media [^c06882c5]. Pediatrics (2013). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis media (AOM) guideline — this evidence-based clinical practice guideline provides recommendations to primary care clinicians for the management of children from 6 months through 12 years of age with uncomplicated AOM and focuses on appropriate diagnosis and initial treatment. The guideline provides a specific, stringent definition of AOM and addresses pain management, initial observation versus antibiotic treatment, appropriate choices of antibiotic agents, and preventive measures, and it also addresses recurrent AOM. Decisions were made on the basis of a systematic grading of the quality of evidence and benefit-harm relationships, and the practice guideline underwent comprehensive peer review before formal approval by the American Academy of Pediatrics. The guideline is not intended as a sole source of guidance; rather, it is intended to assist primary care clinicians by providing a framework for clinical decision-making, not to replace clinical judgment or establish a protocol for all children, and these recommendations may not provide the only appropriate approach to management.

### Durations of antibiotic treatment for acute otitis media and variability in prescribed durations across two large academic health systems [^327d72f2]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2024). Medium credibility.

Amoxicillin is the recommended antibiotic for most children who have not had AOM in the prior 30 days, but we observed only 70% of antibiotic prescriptions at index encounters for AOM were for amoxicillin. This is in the range of prior studies using commercial insurance claims databases where 57–71% of patients were prescribed amoxicillin. Notably, 16% of antibiotic prescriptions in our cohort were for cefdinir. This may in part be a response to reported beta-lactam allergies, present in 11% of encounters. However, it is known that over 90% of children with a reported allergy are able to tolerate the antibiotic. A study among children enrolled in Kentucky Medicaid found similarly high rates of cefdinir prescribing for AOM, with 27–30% of all cefdinir prescriptions having an indication of AOM. Cefdinir is a broader-spectrum antibiotic than amoxicillin, and based on pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties, oral cephalosporins are unlikely to achieve sufficiently high levels in middle ear fluid to effectively treat most pneumococcal ear infections. Rising rates of cefdinir use for common outpatient infections are concerning and, therefore, represent a target for future stewardship interventions.

### Outpatient antibiotic prescribing for 357, 390 children with otitis media [^fb10b689]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Otitis media (OM) is a common complication of respiratory tract infections in children. Over 130,000 acute OM cases were diagnosed and treated in Finnish children in public health care centers in 2014. Nearly half of the infants have suffered from acute OM during their first living year and 70% before the age of 2 years. Among 17 European evidence-based guidelines, all recommend analgesics, and 15 recommend the wait-and-see practice in selected cases, and when treated, 14 recommend amoxicillin as the first-choice antibiotics: 7 with the dose of 40–50 mg/kg/day and 7 with the dose of 90 mg/kg/day.

The Finnish Current Care Guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of OM, which were published in 2011 and updated in 2017, are in line with the European guidelines. The Finnish guidelines recommend that children younger than 24 months of age, and children with bulging eardrum, draining middle ear or purulent OM in both ears should be treated immediately, and the first-line antibiotics are amoxicillin or amoxicillin-clavulanic acid. High amoxicillin dosing is not needed due to the low frequency of pneumococcal penicillin resistance in the country. Second-generation cephalosporins, trimethoprim-sulfa and macrolides are the second-line drugs recommended for those allergic to penicillin. Children 2 years of age and upward with less prominent clinical findings can be left without antibiotics, but they must be reexamined after 2 to 3 days if the symptoms continue.

A task force set up by the European Paediatric Association concluded that the overconsumption of antibiotics in children with spontaneously recovering respiratory tract infections is 1 of the 4 most important health care problems in children in Europe. Indeed, many children with signs and symptoms of OM during acute respiratory infection recover spontaneously, and a wait-and-see practice with delayed introduction of antibiotics, if needed, is justified in appropriate cases and eventually reduces the consumption of antibiotics at the population level.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate antibiotic prescriptions for children with OM in a nationwide private network of outpatient clinics in Finland. Special focus was paid to amoxicillin and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid prescriptions, which have been the first-choice recommendations since 2017, according to Finnish guidelines. A nationwide dataset allowed an estimation of variations by age, time, region and the specialty of the physicians. Further, we were interested in identifying potential needs and specific areas for future active interventions antibiotic use among children with OM.

### Shortened antimicrobial treatment for acute otitis media in young children [^0cbe4867]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2016). Excellent credibility.

Background

Limiting the duration of antimicrobial treatment constitutes a potential strategy to reduce the risk of antimicrobial resistance among children with acute otitis media.

Methods

We assigned 520 children, 6 to 23 months of age, with acute otitis media to receive amoxicillin-clavulanate either for a standard duration of 10 days or for a reduced duration of 5 days followed by placebo for 5 days. We measured rates of clinical response (in a systematic fashion, on the basis of signs and symptomatic response), recurrence, and nasopharyngeal colonization, and we analyzed episode outcomes using a noninferiority approach. Symptom scores ranged from 0 to 14, with higher numbers indicating more severe symptoms.

Results

Children who were treated with amoxicillin-clavulanate for 5 days were more likely than those who were treated for 10 days to have clinical failure (77 of 229 children [34%] vs. 39 of 238 [16%]; difference, 17 percentage points [based on unrounded data]; 95% confidence interval, 9 to 25). The mean symptom scores over the period from day 6 to day 14 were 1.61 in the 5-day group and 1.34 in the 10-day group (P = 0.07); the mean scores at the day-12-to-14 assessment were 1.89 versus 1.20 (P = 0.001). The percentage of children whose symptom scores decreased more than 50% (indicating less severe symptoms) from baseline to the end of treatment was lower in the 5-day group than in the 10-day group (181 of 227 children [80%] vs. 211 of 233 [91%], P = 0.003). We found no significant between-group differences in rates of recurrence, adverse events, or nasopharyngeal colonization with penicillin-nonsusceptible pathogens. Clinical-failure rates were greater among children who had been exposed to three or more children for 10 or more hours per week than among those with less exposure (P = 0.02) and were also greater among children with infection in both ears than among those with infection in one ear (P < 0.001).

Conclusions

Among children 6 to 23 months of age with acute otitis media, reduced-duration antimicrobial treatment resulted in less favorable outcomes than standard-duration treatment; in addition, neither the rate of adverse events nor the rate of emergence of antimicrobial resistance was lower with the shorter regimen.

### Durations of antibiotic treatment for acute otitis media and variability in prescribed durations across two large academic health systems [^057be093]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Acute otitis media (AOM) accounts for roughly 25% of antibiotics prescribed to children annually. Despite national guidelines that recommend short (5–7 days) durations of antibiotics for children 2 years and older with AOM, most receive long (10 day) courses. This study aims to evaluate antibiotic durations prescribed for children aged 2–17 years with uncomplicated AOM across two pediatric academic health systems, and to assess the variability in prescribed durations between and within each system.

Methods

Electronic medical record data from 135 care locations at two health systems were retrospectively analyzed. Outpatient encounters for children aged 2–17 years with a diagnosis of AOM from 2019 to 2022 were included. The primary outcome was the percent of 5-day prescriptions. Secondary outcomes included the proportion of 7-day prescriptions, 10-day prescriptions, prescriptions for nonfirst-line antibiotics, cases associated with treatment failure, AOM recurrence, and adverse drug events.

Results

Among 73 198 AOM encounters for children 2 years and older, 61 612 (84%) encounters resulted in an antibiotic prescription. Most prescriptions were for 10 days (45 689; 75%), 20% were for 7 days (12 060), and only 5% were for 5 days (3144). Treatment failure, AOM recurrence, adverse drug events, hospitalizations, and office, emergency department or urgent-care visits for AOM within 30 days after the index visit were rare.

Conclusions

Despite national guidelines that recommend shorter durations for children with uncomplicated AOM, 75% of our cohort received 10-day durations. Shortening durations of therapy for AOM could reduce antibiotic exposure and should be a priority of pediatric antibiotic stewardship programs.

### Clinical outcomes associated with amoxicillin treatment for acute otitis media in children [^6cda2b31]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute otitis media (AOM) is the most common reason children are prescribed antibiotics. Bacteria that produce beta-lactamase are an increasingly frequent cause of AOM and may be resistant to amoxicillin, the currently recommended treatment for AOM. We aimed to evaluate the clinical outcomes of children treated with amoxicillin for AOM and assessed whether outcomes vary by infecting pathogen or beta-lactamase production.

Methods

205 children 6–35 months old diagnosed with AOM and prescribed amoxicillin were included. Bacterial culture and qualitative multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction were performed on nasopharyngeal swabs collected at enrollment. Parents completed surveys assessing symptoms, antibiotic adherence, and potential adverse events. The primary outcome was treatment failure with amoxicillin. Secondary outcomes included recurrence, symptom improvement, resolution, and adverse drug events (ADE).

Results

8 children (5.4%) experienced treatment failure and 14 (6.8%) had recurrence. By day 5, 152 (74.1%) children had symptom improvement and 97 (47.3%) had resolution. Parents reported ADE for 56 (27.3%) children. Among 149 children who did not take any amoxicillin before enrollment, 98 (65.8%) had one or more beta-lactamase-producing bacteria. Common bacterial otopathogens were Moraxella catarrhalis (79, 53.0%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (51, 34.2%), Haemophilus influenzae (30, 20.1%), and Staphylococcus aureus (21, 14.1%). Treatment failure did not differ between children that did (5, 5.1%) and did not (3, 5.9%) have beta-lactamase-producing otopathogens (p = .05).

Conclusions

Among children diagnosed with AOM treated with amoxicillin, treatment failure was uncommon and did not differ by pathogen or beta-lactamase production. These data support guidance recommending amoxicillin despite an increasing prevalence of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria.

### Diagnosis and treatment of acute otitis media: an assessment [^c2132c26]. Pediatrics (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess compliance with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) evidence-based guidelines for the judicious use of antimicrobials in children with acute otitis media (AOM).

Methods

Compliance with CDC's recommended diagnostic criteria and antimicrobial treatments for management of AOM was assessed by chart review and self-report for 29 community pediatricians in St. Louis, Missouri. For each physician, a simple random sample of AOM visits was selected and reviewed by trained reviewers. In addition, each physician completed a questionnaire.

Results

Compliance with recommended diagnostic criteria was 38% (95% confidence interval: 34%-42%; n = 573) by chart audit and 41% (95% confidence interval: 24%-61%; n = 29) by self-report. Antimicrobial selection assessed by chart audit was consistent with CDC guidelines in 68% (95% confidence interval: 64%-72%) of visits for a new infection, 63% (95% confidence interval: 47%-78%) of visits for treatment failure, and 50% (95% confidence interval: 33%-67%) for recurrent disease. Self-reported compliance with treatment guidelines for new infection was 100% (95% confidence interval: 88%-100%) and 83% (95% confidence interval: 64%-94%) for treatment failure. Noncompliance was most frequently attributable to overuse of broad-spectrum antimicrobials. Most patients treated with amoxicillin received a 10-day course (98%). Subtherapeutic dosing occurred in 26% of patients treated with amoxicillin.

Conclusions

Overdiagnosis of AOM is common. Efforts to improve the judicious use of antimicrobials for AOM should focus on improving diagnostic accuracy, limiting the use of broad-spectrum antimicrobials to cases where they offer clinical benefit, and ensuring that amoxicillin dosing regimens are optimal.

### Durations of antibiotic treatment for acute otitis media and variability in prescribed durations across two large academic health systems [^2c068882]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2024). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

In this evaluation of antibiotic prescribing practices for uncomplicated AOM in children ages 2 years and older across 135 ambulatory care locations in two large academic health systems, an antibiotic was prescribed in 84% of cases. When an antibiotic was prescribed, three-quarters were for 10-day durations while only 5% were for 5 days. The pattern of prescribed durations was similar across all types of care locations. One-quarter of antibiotic prescriptions were for nonfirst-line antibiotics.

Despite existing national guideline recommendations for 5–7-day antibiotic durations for children 2 years and older with uncomplicated AOM, we found that most (75%) antibiotic prescriptions were for 10 days. These findings are similar to previously published studies using large insurance claims databases, which found 88–93% of children were prescribed 10 days of antibiotics. Over the present 4-year study period, there were 45 689 prescriptions for 10 days, equating to 114 223 antibiotic days per year. If these prescriptions were instead written for 7 days or 5 days, 34 267 or 57 111 antibiotic days per year, respectively, would have been avoided. Such a reduction in antibiotic days could have broad cost-saving opportunities both in terms of costs associated with the drug itself, antibiotic resistance, adverse effects, and potential school/daycare and workdays missed. Such changes in prescribing practices are feasible. A multifaceted intervention to promote shorter durations of antibiotics for uncomplicated AOM through individualized prescribing feedback to clinicians in general pediatrics clinics with peer comparison, EMR prescription prompts, and patient and clinician education increased the proportion of prescriptions for 5-day durations from 11 to 85% and did not result in increased episodes of treatment failure or recurrence. Scaling such an intervention could, therefore, have a dramatic impact on reducing unnecessary antibiotic exposure for children with AOM. A large, multicenter, cluster-randomized trial to further evaluate the generalizability, effectiveness, acceptability, and sustainability of this approach has been funded and is being developed.

Initial antibiotic therapy for acute otitis media — microbiology and effect sizes indicate benefit: tympanocentesis cultures showed 55% with bacteria only and 15% with bacteria and virus; a meta-analysis reported a 14% increase in absolute rates of clinical improvement, and systematic reviews before 2011 found increases of 6% to 12% with initial antibiotics. Trials using stringent diagnostic criteria in young children showed differences in clinical improvement of 26% to 35% favoring antibiotics, with greater benefit for bilateral AOM or AOM with otorrhea; antibiotic therapy also decreased duration of pain, analgesic use, or school absence and parent days missed from work. Children younger than 2 years may take longer to improve and are more likely to benefit, yet many cases resolve without antibiotics, and a clinically significant benefit is observed for bilateral AOM, Streptococcus pneumoniae infection, or AOM with otorrhea.

### The diagnosis and management of acute otitis media [^5374ea0f]. Pediatrics (2013). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis media (AOM) — bacterial susceptibility to antibiotics and dosing: Early studies show that 19% of children with S pneumoniae and 48% with H influenzae cultured on initial tympanocentesis who were not treated with antibiotic cleared the bacteria at the time of a second tympanocentesis 2 to 7 days later, and approximately 75% of children infected with M catarrhalis experienced bacteriologic cure even after treatment with amoxicillin, an antibiotic to which it is not susceptible. Current US data indicate that approximately 83% and 87% of isolates of S pneumoniae from all age groups are susceptible to regular (40 mg/kg/day) and high-dose amoxicillin (80–90 mg/kg/day divided twice daily), respectively. High-dose amoxicillin will yield middle ear fluid levels that exceed the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of all S pneumoniae serotypes that are intermediately resistant to penicillin (penicillin MICs, 0.12–1.0 μg/mL), and may not hit all highly resistant serotypes (penicillin MICs, ≥ 2 μg/mL) for a longer period of the dosing interval and has been shown to improve bacteriologic and clinical efficacy.

### A prospective observational study of 5-, 7-, and 10-day antibiotic treatment for acute otitis media [^0963d615]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare 5-, 7- and 10-day duration of antibiotic therapy for acute otitis media (AOM) in children.

Study Design and Setting

Prospective nonrandomized 1-year evaluation of 3 treatment durations for AOM in a private pediatric setting. Outcomes assessed at 14 ± 4 days after start of therapy with clinical response categorized as cure, improvement, or failure.

Results

A total of 2172 children were studied; 46.4% were ≤ 2-years-old. Antibiotics used were amoxicillin (61.9% of patients), trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (11.7%), cephalosporins (14.2%), amoxicillin/clavulanate (5.2%), and macrolides/azalides (4.8%). No overall difference in outcome was observed comparing the 5-day (n = 707), 7-day (n = 423), or 10-day (n = 1042) treatments, including children ≤ 2-years-old. However, in the subset who had an episode of AOM in the preceding month, outcome differed; 5-day treatment was followed by more frequent failure than 10-day treatment (P < 0.001). In logistic regression analysis, variables identified as contributing to a cure were: > 2-years-old (P < 0.0001), no AOM in the preceding month (P = 0.07), or preceding 12 months (P = 0.03).

Conclusions

Our study supports the transition from 10 to 5 days for standard AOM antibiotic treatment duration in most patients. A 10-day regimen may be superior in children who have experienced an episode of AOM within the preceding month, a known risk factor for resistant bacterial infection in the otitis-prone patient.

### Antibiotic dosing for acute otitis media in children: a weighty issue [^64cad94e]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2010). Low credibility.

Background

The American Academy of Pediatrics 2004 guidelines on diagnosis and management of acute otitis media (OM) recommends use of high-dose amoxicillin for the treatment of acute uncomplicated OM. With rising childhood obesity, recommended amoxicillin dose of 80 to 90 mg/kg per day often exceed standard adult dose of 1500 mg/d.

Objective

To study prescribing patterns of primary care physicians for amoxicillin in the treatment of OM. To assess opinions of American Academy of Pediatrics subcommittee members who participated in guideline formulation.

Methods

This study had 2 parts. Part 1: Retrospective review of medical records of children visiting the hospital between April and June 2008 and with a diagnosis of OM and were prescribed amoxicillin. Part 2: Web-based survey of 14 members of the OM guidelines subcommittee.

Results

Part 1: Three hundred fifty-nine children were eligible, with a mean (SD) age of 3.2 (4.0) years and 185 (51.5%) of whom were males. Children weighing 20 kg or less received higher mean daily dose of amoxicillin (74.2 vs 40.4 mg/kg per day, P < 0.00). Part 2: Nine (64.3%) subcommittee members responded to the survey. Most (77.8%) affirmed that the impact of obesity on high-dose amoxicillin recommendation was not discussed during guideline formulation. If a patient's estimated amoxicillin dose exceeded the standard adult dose (1500 mg/d), 66.7% members would prescribe the standard adult dose whereas 33.3% would prescribe the recommended dose of 80 to 90 mg/kg per day.

Conclusions

Primary care physicians prescribe a significantly lower-than-recommended amoxicillin dose in older children and those in the higher weight category. The opinion among subcommittee members regarding maximum dose specification of amoxicillin is varied.

### Outpatient antibiotic prescribing for 357, 390 children with otitis media [^62983f18]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

We found evidence that adherence to the Finnish Current Care guidelines on the treatment of OM in children was rather good. Less than half received antibiotics, and the great majority received amoxicillin or amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, which were the first-choice recommendations in the guidelines. To further increase concordance, active interventions should especially be targeted to tackle the identified challenges (eg, specialty or age group). Existing EHR systems could be armed with automated guideline-specific algorithms tailored according to diagnosis, patient group and physician's specialty. Combining such systems with real-time monitoring and systematic feedback for physicians could facilitate the adaptation of various guidelines to day-to-day practice.

### Cost-effectiveness analysis of treatment options for acute otitis media [^93c66b75]. Annals of Family Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose

This study evaluated the costs and utility of observation and routine antibiotic treatment options for children with acute otitis media.

Methods

The cost-effectiveness analysis was performed among children aged 6 months to 12 years seen in primary care offices. The interventions studied were watchful waiting as practiced in the Netherlands, delayed prescription, 5 days of amoxicillin, and 7 to 10 days of amoxicillin. The main outcome measure was cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY).

Results

In the base case analysis, delayed prescription was the least costly option and 7 to 10 days of amoxicillin was the most effective. The incremental cost utility ratio (ICUR) of 7 to 10 days of amoxicillin compared with delayed prescription was 56,000 dollars per QALY gained. Watchful waiting and 5 days of amoxicillin were inferior options. The results were sensitive to the rate of nonattendance in the delayed prescription strategy: when the rate was less than 23%, watchful waiting was the least costly option and delayed prescription was an inferior option. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis, in which all model variables were simultaneously varied, showed with 95% certainty that compared with delayed prescription, 7 to 10 days of amoxicillin had a 61% probability of having an ICUR of greater than 50,000 dollars per QALY gained, and watchful waiting had a 23% probability of having an ICUR of less than 50,000 dollars per QALY gained.

Conclusions

Economically, an approach to the treatment of acute otitis media with either an initial period of observation or routine treatment with amoxicillin is reasonable.

### A cost-utility analysis of 5 strategies for the management of acute otitis media in children [^16a8069c]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess whether antimicrobial therapy in young children with acute otitis media reduces time to resolution of symptoms, overall symptom burden, and persistence of otoscopic evidence of infection. We used a cost-utility model to evaluate whether immediate antimicrobial treatment seems to be worthwhile, and if so, which antimicrobial agent is most cost effective.

Study Design

We compared the cost per quality-adjusted life-day of 5 treatment regimens in children younger than 2 years of age with acute otitis media: immediate amoxicillin/clavulanate, immediate amoxicillin, immediate cefdinir, watchful waiting, and delayed prescription (DP) for antibiotic.

Results

The 5 treatment regimens, listed in order from least effective to most effective were DP, watchful waiting, immediate cefdinir, immediate amoxicillin, and immediate amoxicillin/clavulanate. Listed in order from least costly to most costly, the regimens were DP, immediate amoxicillin, watchful waiting, immediate amoxicillin/clavulanate, and immediate cefdinir. The incremental cost-utility ratio of immediate amoxicillin compared with DP was $101.07 per quality-adjusted life-day gained. The incremental cost-utility ratio of immediate amoxicillin/clavulanate compared with amoxicillin was $2331.28 per quality-adjusted life-day gained.

Conclusions

In children younger than 2 years of age with acute otitis media and no recent antibiotic exposure, immediate amoxicillin seems to be the most cost-effective initial treatment.

Acute otitis media (AOM) randomized trial in children 6 to 23 months — amoxicillin-clavulanate versus placebo — reported symptom resolution, failure, and adverse events with quantified effects. Included in the study were 291 patients 6 to 23 months of age: 144 in the antibiotic group and 147 in the placebo group. Initial resolution (AOM-SOS score 0 or 1) with amoxicillin-clavulanate occurred in 35% by day 2, 61% by day 4, and 80% by day 7, versus 28%, 54%, and 74% with placebo (P = 0.14). For sustained resolution (second of 2 successive AOM-SOS 0 or 1), values were 20% by day 2, 41% at day 4, and 67% at day 7 with amoxicillin-clavulanate versus 14%, 36%, and 53% with placebo (P = 0.04). Treatment failure occurred by day 4 to 5 in 4% with antimicrobial treatment versus 23% with placebo (P < .001) and at day 10 to 12 in 16% versus 51% (NNT = 2.9, P < .001). By day 10 to 12, clinical failure in unilateral AOM was 9% with amoxicillin-clavulanate versus 41% with placebo (RD, 32%; NNT = 3), and in bilateral AOM was 23% versus 60% (RD, 37%; NNT = 3). Most common adverse events were diarrhea (25% vs 15%; P = 0.05) and diaper dermatitis (51% vs 35%; P = 0.008), and one placebo recipient developed mastoiditis.

### Pediatric ear, nose, and throat emergencies [^77d8b6b9]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

Acute otitis media is the most common infection for which antibiotics are prescribed in children, resulting in more than 20 million antibiotic prescriptions annually. New practice guidelines published by the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Academy of Family Physicians call for the judicious use of antibiotics in view of increasing antibiotic resistance and the unclear necessity of the use of antibiotics in children with uncomplicated acute otitis media. This article reviews those guidelines, several other common ear, nose, and throat entities, including sinusitis and dental emergencies, and current strategies in diagnosis and treatment.

### Trends in broad-spectrum antibiotic prescribing for children with acute otitis media in the United States, 1998–2004 [^5d3a6fa5]. BMC Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

Conclusion

In conclusion, the prescribing of broad-spectrum antibiotics for AOM has increased dramatically from 1998 to 2004 and the trend occurred in the midst of the implementation of a national immunization program effective in decreasing the severity and incidence of this common pediatric infection. Physicians have increased their prescribing of broad-spectrum antibiotics for AOM without correlation to clinical factors such as age or severity of illness. If primary care physicians decide antibiotics are needed for AOM, prescribing amoxicillin as initial therapy is recommended for most children, especially with the reassurance of its effectiveness provided by PCV.

### Acute otitis media guidelines in selected developed and developing countries: uniformity and diversity [^99b3f0c5]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Acute otitis media (AOM) is a common childhood disease, with an enormous economic and healthcare-related burden. Guidelines and consensus papers for AOM diagnosis and management were published in many countries. Our objective was to study the differences and similarities between these protocols in developing and developed countries.

Methods

The keywords: 'acute otitis media' AND 'children' AND ['treatment' or 'management'] AND ['guideline' or 'consensus'] were used in various electronic databases between 1 January 1989 through 31 December 2015. Overall, 99 sources from 62 countries were retrieved: 53 from 22 developed countries, and 46 from 40 developing countries. Representative guidelines from America (the USA, Argentina), Europe (Italy, Moldova), Africa (South Africa, Tanzania, Ethiopia), Asia (Japan, Afghanistan, Sri Lanka), and Oceania (South Australia, Fiji) were compared.

Results

Paediatric societies publish guidelines in most developed countries; in developing countries, the Ministry of Health usually initiates guideline formulation. Most guidelines use the same diagnostic criteria and offer watchful waiting in mild-moderate scenarios. Amoxicillin is the suggested first-line antibiotic, whereas options for second-line and third-line therapies vary. Duration of therapy varies and is usually age dependent: 5-7days for children < 2years and 10days for children > 2years in developed countries, while duration and age groups vary greatly in developing countries. Reduction of AOM risk factors is encouraged in developed countries, but rarely in developing countries.

Conclusions

Guidelines for AOM from developing and developed countries are similar in many aspects, with variation in specific recommendations, due to local epidemiology and healthcare accessibility. Formulation of regional guidelines may help reduce AOM burden.

### Durations of antibiotic treatment for acute otitis media and variability in prescribed durations across two large academic health systems [^4b3abd54]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2024). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

The final study cohort included 73 198 encounters for uncomplicated AOM (24 815 [34%] from VUMC and 48 383 [66%] from Washington University) among 54 473 unique children 2 years and older (Figure 1). The number of encounters varied by year but was markedly lower during 2020 — the first year of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. During the validation by manual review of 60 medical records, clinical diagnosis of AOM, whether an antibiotic was prescribed, and the agent prescribed were concordant with electronically abstracted data in 59 (98%) of cases. In 58 (97%) cases, the prescribed duration was concordant. Patient demographics are shown in Table 1. Most encounters were for white (n = 54 548; 75%), non-Hispanic/Latino (n = 53 750; 73%), English-speaking (69 103; 94%), and commercially insured (n = 70 706; 97%) patients. Visits were primarily with physicians (n = 45 854, 63%) and the most common settings were primary care clinics (n = 34 046; 47%) or urgent-care clinics (n = 20 031; 27%; Table 1). Additional clinical characteristics are described in Supplemental Table 1.

Study cohort description.

A total of 61 612 (84%) encounters resulted in an antibiotic prescription (Table 2). The percentage of prescriptions for 7 days increased over time (11% in 2019 vs 26% in 2022), while 10-day prescriptions decreased over time (84% in 2019 vs 67% in 2022; Table 2). A higher proportion of encounters at VUMC (n = 22 268; 90%) resulted in an antibiotic prescription than at Washington University (n = 39 344; 81%; Table 3). Antibiotic selection was similar across both health systems. The most common antibiotic prescribed was amoxicillin (n = 43 367; 70%); nonfirst-line antibiotics were prescribed in 30% of cases, most commonly cefdinir (n = 9606; 16%; Table 2 and Supplemental Table 3). A beta-lactam allergy was listed in 8052 (11%) encounters.

### Outpatient antibiotic prescribing for 357, 390 children with otitis media [^bbe9ec79]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

There are 3 main results in this real-life, 7-year observational study on antibiotic prescriptions for over 350,00 children with OM in private primary care. First, there was a substantial decrease in macrolide prescriptions, which led to a decrease in overall antibiotic prescriptions from 48.3% of children with OM in 2014 to 41.4% in 2020. Second, antibiotic choices varied significantly according to the doctor's specialty. When only patients who were treated with antibiotics were included in the analyses, pediatricians prescribed amoxicillin or amoxicillin-clavulanic acid to 80% of OM patients, compared to 67% by GPs and 55% by ENT physicians. Amoxicillin was chosen most frequently by GPs, and macrolides by ENT physicians. Pediatricians chose amoxicillin and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid equally often. Third, during the postguideline years of 2018–2020, concordance with recommended OM treatment was highest among pediatricians and lowest among ENT physicians.

The 2011 Finnish Current Care Guidelines recommended amoxicillin as the first choice and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid as an alternative second-choice antibiotic for acute OM, and the 2017 updated guidelines recommended both amoxicillin and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid as first-choice drugs. This led to a minor increase in amoxicillin-clavulanic acid prescriptions. If the finding in otoscopy suggests nonpurulent OM, both guidelines recommend refraining from antibiotics and re-examination after 2–3 days if symptoms continue. This so-called wait-and-see practice has led to reduced antibiotic prescriptions and has been cost-effective compared to usual care.

In our study, there was a relative decrease of 14.3% in the overall prescriptions of antibiotics between 2014 and 2020. This suggests that, in 2020, over half of the patients did not receive antibiotics. Our study design did not allow us to assess the exact reasons for this observed reduction, such as a possible increase in wait-and-see practice. Similar decreasing trends in antibiotic prescriptions have been found in other studies. A probable explanation is the gradual adaptation to widely disseminated local clinical practice or current care guidelines. A systematic review on the impact of OM treatment guidelines in children included 7 observational studies conducted in 6 countries. Six studies primarily recommended analgesics and the wait-and-see practice. – In 5 studies that reported antibiotic prescription rates, – 3 showed a decline of 5%–12% up to 3 years after guideline introduction, but 2 found no effects.

### Treatment of acute otitis media in the pediatric emergency department [^29d9aee9]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Over-treatment of acute otitis media (AOM) with antibiotics is common, and poses a high burden on health-care systems.

Methods

Records of children 6–36 months of age with AOM visiting a university-affiliated pediatric emergency department between 2014 and 2016 were reviewed for the treatment given: watchful waiting versus antibiotics. If antibiotics were prescribed, the type and duration were recorded. We evaluated appropriate and inappropriate treatment rates of eligible AOM cases, in respect to the local guidelines, which encourage watchful waiting in most mild-moderate cases.

Results

Out of 1493 AOM visits, 863 (57.8%) were boys, with a median age of 14.9 months (interquartile range, 9–19). The overall pre-visit antibiotic rate was 24.1%, but among those children examined by a physician, this rate was 95.2%. Amoxicillin was the most common antibiotic, administered in 66.3% of the cases. Only 21 children (5.8%) had been treated with antibiotics for ≥ 7 days before their visit, and were considered as treatment failure. Antibiotic therapy upon discharge was recorded in 1394/1449 visits (96.2%), again with amoxicillin as the most common antibiotic therapy, in 80.8% of the cases. In these visits, the average duration of antibiotic treatment was 8.29 days. Appropriateness of treatment (watchful waiting or antibiotics) could be analyzed in 1134 visits; 20.9% were considered as inappropriate. Of them, 98.3% were prescribed with the wrong antibiotic type and duration.

Conclusions

Adherence rate to the local guidelines treatment recommendations for uncomplicated AOM was high, as measured by whether appropriate treatment was given and type and duration of antibiotics.

### The diagnosis and management of acute otitis media [^6a974e18]. Pediatrics (2013). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis media (AOM) management terminology — Key terms are defined for consistent use: "Otitis externa — an infection of the external auditory canal", "Tympanometry — measuring acoustic immittance (transfer of acoustic energy) of the ear as a function of ear canal air pressure", and "Number needed to treat (NNT) — the number of patients who need to be treated to prevent 1 additional bad outcome". Initial antibiotic therapy is defined as "treatment of AOM with antibiotics that are prescribed at the time of diagnosis with the intent of starting antibiotic therapy as soon as possible after the encounter", whereas initial observation is "initial management of AOM limited to symptomatic relief, with commencement of antibiotic therapy only if the child's condition worsens at any time or does not show clinical improvement within 48 to 72 hours of diagnosis; a mechanism must be in place to ensure follow-up and initiation of antibiotics if the child fails observation".

### Prognostic factors for treatment failure in acute otitis media [^45999373]. Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Antimicrobial treatment is effective in the management of acute otitis media (AOM), but approximately half of the children may recover without antimicrobial agents. By identifying patients who may not require antimicrobial treatment for the management of AOM, the use of antimicrobial agents could be substantially reduced. Our aim was to identify subgroups of children with AOM who would benefit most from antimicrobial treatment and children who could be suitable for initial observation.

Methods

This is a secondary analysis of randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Children 6 to 35 months of age with AOM (N = 319) were randomly allocated to receive amoxicillin-clavulanate (40/5.7 mg/kg per day) or placebo for 7 days. Our primary outcome was time until treatment failure.

Results

Treatment failure occurred in 31.7% of all children. Older age (24–35 months) and peaked tympanogram at entry decreased the hazard for treatment failure (hazard ratio, 0.53; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.29 to 0.96; P = 0.04; and hazard ratio, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.21 to 0.88; P = 0.02, respectively). The rate difference for treatment failure between antimicrobial treatment and placebo groups was highest among children with severe bulging of the tympanic membrane (11.1% vs 64.1%; rate difference -53.0%; 95% CI, -73.5% to -32.4%), resulting in a number needed to treat of 1.9.

Conclusions

Children with severe bulging of the tympanic membrane seem to benefit most from antimicrobial treatment of AOM. On the other hand, children with peaked tympanogram (A and C curves) may be optimal candidates for initial observation.

### Diagnosis and management of acute otitis media in the urgent care setting [^6489e4b6]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

The prevalence of otitis media is increasing, which affects health care resource utilization across all segments, including the urgent care setting. One of the greatest challenges in the management of acute otitis media (AOM) is the effective treatment of cases caused by pathogens that are resistant to commonly used antibiotics. Whereas the production of beta-lactamases among strains of Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis is an important consideration for antimicrobial therapy, the high prevalence of resistance to penicillin and other classes of antibiotics among strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae represents a greater clinical concern. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently convened the Drug Resistant S. pneumoniae Therapeutic Working Group to develop evidence-based recommendations for the treatment of AOM in an era of prevalent resistance. The recommendations from this group included amoxicillin as the preferred first-line drug because of the demonstrated activity against penicillin-intermediate and -resistant strains of S. pneumoniae, using higher dosages of up to 90 mg/kg per day in certain settings. For patients in whom initial treatment is unsuccessful after 3 days, the recommended agents included high-dose amoxicillin-clavulanate (for activity against beta-lactamase-producing pathogens), clindamycin, cefuroxime axetil, or 1 to 3 doses of intramuscular ceftriaxone. The principles set forth in these guidelines can assist the therapeutic decisionmaking process for practitioners in the urgent care setting.

### Durations of antibiotic treatment for acute otitis media and variability in prescribed durations across two large academic health systems [^3ccf64b1]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2024). Medium credibility.

This study has several strengths. Our dataset included a diverse array of ambulatory care locations across two large health systems consisting of 135 different sites of care and over 700 clinicians. We were able to use patient-level EMR data to capture diagnoses of AOM and associated antibiotic prescriptions. To our knowledge, this is the first study describing variation in prescribed durations of therapy for AOM at the site of care and clinician levels. There are several important limitations to this study. First, identification of cases using ICD-10 codes and electronic abstraction of data from the EMR invariably leads to misclassification. Reassuringly, however, we demonstrated high concordance between manual chart review and the electronic data abstraction methods used for key variables including the diagnosis of AOM, antibiotics prescribed, and duration of therapy, although we only validated a small subset of encounters (0.08% of charts). Additionally, we could not verify the accuracy of clinicians' diagnoses of AOM. Prior studies have shown that around 50% of children diagnosed with AOM do not actually meet objective diagnostic criteria for AOM. However, since children are routinely misdiagnosed with AOM and treated with antibiotics in clinical practice, it is important to capture and describe antibiotic use irrespective of whether the diagnosis is correct. In fact, a potential benefit of promoting the broad use of 5-day durations of therapy is that the short duration minimizes harm when AOM is incorrectly diagnosed and treated. Second, we were unable to evaluate prescriptions written for watchful waiting or safety-net antibiotic prescriptions. Watchful waiting is an important antibiotic stewardship intervention shown to reduce antibiotic exposure in children with AOM. Finally, our study population was mostly white, English-speaking patients with commercial insurance from two geographically disparate academic health systems in the United States, thus our findings may not be generalizable to other populations.

Antibiotic prescribing for AOM is an important opportunity to improve antibiotic stewardship in children. Across two large health systems, we demonstrated that three-quarters of antibiotic prescriptions were longer than recommended. The use of 5-day durations was uncommon across all types of care locations, and there was limited variability among individual clinicians. Shortening durations of therapy for AOM have the potential to markedly reduce antibiotic exposure among children; this may lead to important reductions in the development of antibiotic resistance, adverse events, and other unintended consequences of antibiotics. Scaling of interventions to promote more widespread use of short treatment durations and first-line antibiotics therefore represents an urgent need in outpatient pediatric antibiotic stewardship. Our data highlight that such interventions must include the spectrum of care locations across ambulatory care.

### Treatment of acute otitis media in children under 2 years of age [^b5433c00]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2011). Excellent credibility.

Background

Recommendations vary regarding immediate antimicrobial treatment versus watchful waiting for children younger than 2 years of age with acute otitis media.

Methods

We randomly assigned 291 children 6 to 23 months of age, with acute otitis media diagnosed with the use of stringent criteria, to receive amoxicillin-clavulanate or placebo for 10 days. We measured symptomatic response and rates of clinical failure.

Results

Among the children who received amoxicillin-clavulanate, 35% had initial resolution of symptoms by day 2, 61% by day 4, and 80% by day 7; among children who received placebo, 28% had initial resolution of symptoms by day 2, 54% by day 4, and 74% by day 7 (P = 0.14 for the overall comparison). For sustained resolution of symptoms, the corresponding values were 20%, 41%, and 67% with amoxicillin-clavulanate, as compared with 14%, 36%, and 53% with placebo (P = 0.04 for the overall comparison). Mean symptom scores over the first 7 days were lower for the children treated with amoxicillin-clavulanate than for those who received placebo (P = 0.02). The rate of clinical failure — defined as the persistence of signs of acute infection on otoscopic examination — was also lower among the children treated with amoxicillin-clavulanate than among those who received placebo: 4% versus 23% at or before the visit on day 4 or 5 (P < 0.001) and 16% versus 51% at or before the visit on day 10 to 12 (P < 0.001). Mastoiditis developed in one child who received placebo. Diarrhea and diaper-area dermatitis were more common among children who received amoxicillin-clavulanate. There were no significant changes in either group in the rates of nasopharyngeal colonization with nonsusceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae.

Conclusions

Among children 6 to 23 months of age with acute otitis media, treatment with amoxicillin-clavulanate for 10 days tended to reduce the time to resolution of symptoms and reduced the overall symptom burden and the rate of persistent signs of acute infection on otoscopic examination.

### Standard-dose amoxicillin for acute otitis media… [^ed2fabd4]. AAFP (2005). Low credibility.

Current guidelines recommend treatment of high-dose amoxicillin for children with acute otitis media who are at high risk for infection with non-susceptible. Streptococcus pneumoniae. This includes all patients who are younger than two years, attend day care, or have recently been exposed to antibiotics. High-dose amoxicillin may not be needed if NSSP prevalence is low in the local area. However, prevalence data on NSSP is limited. Garbutt and colleagues used data from nasopharyngeal cultures to estimate the prevalence of NSSP in one city, and to develop community-specific treatment guidelines based on local susceptibility. Patients from seven pediatric offices were enrolled in the study; the inclusion criteria were age younger than seven years and a new diagnosis of AOM or one of several other upper respiratory infections. A posterior nasopharyngeal swab was obtained from each child.

Minimum inhibitory concentrations were then measured on. Of the 212 participating children, 70 had nonspecific upper respitory infection and 58 had AOM, the most frequent diagnoses. Twenty-nine of the children with AOM had positive nasopharyngeal swabs, as did 11 of those with otitis media with effusion, eight of those with acute sinusitis, and 30 of those with URI. In this study population, the authors calculate, standard-dose amoxicillin would have been effective in most patients treated for AOM. No more than an estimated 3 percent would have failed treatment. This percentage may in reality be even less because, among other reasons, nasopharyngeal carriage overestimates the presence of the organism in the middle ear. the authors conclude that treating the local population with standard-dose amoxicillin would be adequate, with high-dose treatment reserved for day-care attendees.

Although nasopharyngeal carriage does not correlate perfectly with middle ear isolates, this study demonstrates that it is relatively easy to measure local prevalence of NSSP and derive treatment recommendations accordingly. Still needed are accurate determinations of amoxicillin resistance and more information regarding the impact of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine on NSSP prevalence.

### Otitis media: rapid evidence review [^b2d3d3d4]. American Family Physician (2019). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis media (AOM) is the most common diagnosis in childhood acute sick visits. By three years of age, 50% to 85% of children will have at least one episode of AOM. Symptoms may include ear pain (rubbing, tugging, or holding the ear may be a sign of pain), fever, irritability, otorrhea, anorexia, and sometimes vomiting or lethargy. AOM is diagnosed in symptomatic children with moderate to severe bulging of the tympanic membrane or new-onset otorrhea not caused by acute otitis externa, and in children with mild bulging and either recent-onset ear pain (less than 48 hours) or intense erythema of the tympanic membrane. Treatment includes pain management plus observation or antibiotics, depending on the patient's age, severity of symptoms, and whether the AOM is unilateral or bilateral. When antibiotics are used, high-dose amoxicillin (80 to 90 mg per kg per day in two divided doses) is first-line therapy unless the patient has taken amoxicillin for AOM in the previous 30 days or has concomitant purulent conjunctivitis; amoxicillin/clavulanate is typically used in this case. Cefdinir or azithromycin should be the first-line antibiotic in those with penicillin allergy based on risk of cephalosporin allergy. Tympanostomy tubes should be considered in children with three or more episodes of AOM within six months or four episodes within one year with one episode in the preceding six months. Pneumococcal and influenza vaccines and exclusive breastfeeding until at least six months of age can reduce the risk of AOM.

### Durations of antibiotic treatment for acute otitis media and variability in prescribed durations across two large academic health systems [^cb097815]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2024). Medium credibility.

Patient demographic and clinical variables were abstracted electronically from the EMR. Study personnel (S. K. and L. S.) independently validated 30 randomly selected cases from each organization to evaluate concordance between the medical record and electronic data extracted for the following key variables: (1) the diagnosis of AOM; (2) whether an antibiotic was prescribed at the visit; and (3) if an antibiotic was prescribed, the agent prescribed and duration of therapy. Data were de-identified and transferred electronically from VUMC and Washington University to Denver Health and Hospital Authority (DHHA) for analysis. The study was approved by the Colorado Multiple Institutional Review Board (COMIRB).

The primary endpoint was the percent of prescriptions for a 5-day duration. Secondary endpoints included the proportion of prescriptions for a 7-day duration, the proportion of prescriptions for a 10-day duration, the proportion of prescriptions for nonfirst-line antibiotics (antibiotics other than amoxicillin), the proportion of cases associated with treatment failure (new antibiotic associated with an AOM encounter within 3–14 days of the initial encounter), AOM recurrence (new antibiotic associated with an AOM encounter within 15–30 days of the initial encounter), or an adverse drug event. Adverse drug events were medically attended visits within 14 days of the index visit with an ICD-10 diagnosis code for nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, candidiasis, noncandidal skin rash, or allergic reaction.

Descriptive statistics for patient and clinical characteristics were performed using R version 4.1.3 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing; Vienna, Austria). Categorical characteristics were summarized with count and percentage overall and by year and site. The duration of antibiotics prescribed by the provider was depicted visually with mean and range.

Acute otitis media guideline — evidence-based statement definitions and implications set four tiers with specific clinician guidance: For Strong Recommendation, "A strong recommendation in favor of a particular action is made when the anticipated benefits of the recommended intervention clearly exceed the harms (as a strong recommendation against an action is made when the anticipated harms clearly exceed the benefits) and the quality of the supporting evidence is excellent", and "Clinicians should follow a strong recommendation unless a clear and compelling rationale for an alternative approach is present". For Recommendation, "A recommendation in favor of a particular action is made when the anticipated benefits exceed the harms, but the quality of evidence is not as strong", with the implication that "Clinicians would be prudent to follow a recommendation but should remain alert to new information and sensitive to patient preferences". For Option, "Options define courses that may be taken when either the quality of evidence is suspect or carefully performed studies have shown little clear advantage to 1 approach over another", and "Clinicians should consider the option in their decision-making, and patient preference may have a substantial role". For No Recommendation, "No recommendation indicates that there is a lack of pertinent published evidence and that the anticipated balance of benefits and harms is presently unclear", and "Clinicians should be alert to new published evidence that clarifies the balance of benefit versus harm".

### Trends in otitis media treatment failure and relapse [^597686ec]. Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

The goals were to describe trends in acute otitis media, treatment failure, and relapse and in high-dose amoxicillin use and to determine whether treatment of acute otitis media with high-dose amoxicillin was associated with treatment failure or relapse.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective study of acute otitis media visits made between 1996 and 2004 by children 2 months to 12 years of age in a large group practice, using computerized data. We defined acute otitis media as an otitis media visit with antibiotics dispensed (preceded by 30 days without otitis media visits), treatment failure as initiation of treatment with a second antibiotic before the first prescription was finished, and relapse as initiation of antibiotic treatment after the first prescription was finished but within 30 days after the index acute otitis media episode. The primary independent measure was high-dose amoxicillin (> 70 mg/kg per day). We evaluated changes over time and determined whether high-dose amoxicillin use was associated with otitis media treatment failure or relapse.

Results

We identified 111,335 acute otitis media visits over a 9-year period. The incidence of acute otitis media decreased from 385.1 visits per 1000 enrollees in 1996 to 188.8 visits per 1000 enrollees in 2004. The proportion of acute otitis media visits treated with high-dose amoxicillin increased from 1.7% in 1996 to 41.9% in 2004. Both otitis media treatment failure and relapse rates decreased from 1996 to 2004 (from 3.9% to 2.6% and from 9.2% to 8.9%, respectively). The odds of treatment failure or relapse did not differ between acute otitis media episodes treated with high-dose and low-dose amoxicillin.

Conclusions

During the past decade, acute otitis media, treatment failure, and relapse became less common and high-dose amoxicillin use increased. However, high-dose amoxicillin treatment did not reduce the risk of individual infections resulting in adverse outcomes.

### Developing community-specific recommendations for first-line treatment of acute otitis media: is high-dose amoxicillin necessary? [^420af7c2]. Pediatrics (2004). Low credibility.

Objectives

National recommendations are to use high-dose amoxicillin (80–90 mg/kg per day) to treat uncomplicated acute otitis media (AOM) in children who are at high risk for infection with nonsusceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae (NSSP). However, high-dose treatment may not be necessary if the local prevalence of NSSP is low. The objective of this study was to estimate the local prevalence of NSSP in children with acute upper respiratory illnesses and to develop community-specific recommendations for first-line empiric treatment of AOM.

Methods

We conducted a cross-sectional prevalence study in the offices of 7 community pediatricians in St Louis, Missouri. S pneumoniae was isolated from nasopharyngeal swabs collected from children who were younger than 7 years and had AOM, nonspecific upper respiratory infection, cough, acute sinusitis, or pharyngitis. Children were excluded from the study when they had received an antibiotic in the previous 4-week period. Parents and providers completed a brief questionnaire to assess risk factors for carriage of NSSP. On the basis of National Clinical Chemistry Laboratory Standards, isolates with a penicillin minimum inhibitory concentration ≥ 0.12 microg/mL were considered to be nonsusceptible to penicillin (NSSP), and isolates with a penicillin minimum inhibitory concentration > 2 microg/mL were categorized as nonsusceptible to standard-dose amoxicillin (35–45 mg/kg per day; NSSP-A).

Results

S pneumoniae was isolated from the nasopharynx of 85 (40%) of 212 study patients (95% confidence interval [CI]: 33%-47%); 41 (48%) of 85 isolates were NSSP (95% CI: 37%-59%), and 6 (7%) were NSSP-A (95% CI: 1.5%-13%). Among the 212 study patients, the prevalence of NSSP was 19% (95% CI: 14%-25%), and the prevalence of NSSP-A was 3% (95% CI: 0.6%-5%). Carriage of NSSP was increased in child care attendees compared with nonattendees (29% vs 14%; odds ratio: 2.6; 95% CI: 1.3–5.2).

Conclusions

In our community, although the prevalence of NSSP among isolates of S pneumoniae identified from the nasopharynx of symptomatic children is high (48%), the probability of NSSP-A infection among symptomatic children is < 5%. Our data support a recommendation to treat most children who have uncomplicated AOM with standard-dose amoxicillin. Children who attend child care or have recently received an antibiotic may require treatment with high-dose amoxicillin. Other communities may benefit from a similar assessment of the prevalence of NSSP and NSSP-A.

### "Give Me five": the case for 5 days of antibiotics as the default duration for acute respiratory tract infections [^5a71ce81]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2024). Medium credibility.

Acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs) account for most antibiotic prescriptions in pediatrics. Although US guidelines continue to recommend ≥ 10 days antibiotics for common ARTIs, evidence suggests that 5-day courses can be safe and effective. Academic imprinting seems to play a major role in the continued use of prolonged antibiotic durations. In this report, we discuss the evidence supporting short antibiotic courses for group A streptococcal pharyngitis, acute otitis media, and acute bacterial rhinosinusitis. We discuss the basis for prolonged antibiotic course recommendations and recent literature investigating shorter courses. Prescribers in the United States should overcome academic imprinting and follow international trends to reduce antibiotic durations for common ARTIs, where 5 days is a safe and efficacious course when antibiotics are prescribed.

### AOM in children [^4f06983d]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2011). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In the UK, about 30% of children under 3 years of age visit their GP each year with acute otitis media (AOM), and 97% of these receive antibiotics. In the US, AOM is the most common reason for outpatient antibiotic treatment. Without antibiotics, AOM resolves within 24 hours in about 60% of children, and within 3 days in about 80% of children.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of treatments for AOM in children; and what are the effects of interventions to prevent recurrence? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to September 2010 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 29 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: analgesics, antibiotics, delayed antibiotics, immediate antibiotics, long-term antibiotic prophylaxis, longer courses of antibiotics, myringotomy, pneumococcal vaccination, tympanostomy with ventilation tubes, xylitol syrup or gum, and influenza vaccination.

### Trends in broad-spectrum antibiotic prescribing for children with acute otitis media in the United States, 1998–2004 [^07c78628]. BMC Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

We also noted that as broad-spectrum antibiotic prescribing increased, amoxicillin prescribing remain stable, despite the operant guideline for this time period recommending high dose amoxicillin as first-line therapy for most children. Of note, the study period ended before the most recent guidelines on AOM, recommending amoxicillin/clavulanate as the initial choice for children with severe infection, would have had a significant impact on amoxicillin prescribing. Encouragingly, we found a significant decrease in the proportion of patients receiving narrow-spectrum antibiotics other than amoxicillin from 1998 to 2004. These antimicrobials have been shown to be less effective options for AOM and are no longer recommended therapy in the United States.

We found that broad-spectrum prescribing was less likely in those children with ear pain and was not associated with age or fever; factors characteristic of more severe infections that might have justified broader coverage. Instead, significant associations were for the nonclinical factors of race, insurance status, geographical location, and ambulatory setting. Over-prescribing of antibiotics to pediatric white patients has been reported in another study. High antibiotic prescribing rates have been found in the South in other studies. And lower rates of nonrecommended (broad-spectrum) antibiotics for children with sore throats seen in emergency departments have been reported as well. In contrast, general practitioners in the Netherlands were more likely to overprescribe antibiotics, according to Dutch guidelines, to younger children who were more severely ill. Unfortunately, due to limitations in the data, we were unable to explore associations with other risk factors linked to the presence of bacterial species likely to be resistant to amoxicillin. These include attendance at child care and recent prescription (less than 30 days) of an antibiotic. However, there is no reason to believe that these factors would have changed significantly over the 7 year period.

### Compared to placebo, long-term antibiotics resolve otitis media with effusion (OME) and prevent acute otitis media with perforation (AOMwiP) in a high-risk population: a randomized controlled trial [^b4f76b2b]. BMC Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

Discussion

We have studied OM in Aboriginal communities where almost all children have persistent middle ear disease from an early age; nevertheless, our results could also be relevant for other high-risk groups. The primary outcome from our double-blind RCT is that amoxicillin significantly increased the proportion of children achieving normal middle ears (bilaterally aerated) at consecutive monthly examinations. Amoxicillin also reduced the proportion of children with any perforation. The proportion with any suppurative OM was also less in the amoxicillin group at the end of therapy, but not significantly so (Table 2). The proportion of children on amoxicillin experiencing at least two episodes of AOMwiP during therapy was less than for placebo children (4% versus 18%, respectively). There was no difference between placebo and amoxicillin in the proportion of children with OME (~52% in each group) or AOMwoP (~22%) at the end of therapy. Risk differences during therapy (supplementary material) were consistent with the end of therapy findings. Pneumococcal non-susceptibility was similar in amoxicillin and placebo groups, however a greater proportion of children in the amoxicillin group were colonised by beta-lactamase producing H. influenzae at both baseline and at end of therapy.

Our findings can be understood in terms of the natural history of OM in high-risk populations. In Aboriginal children, AOM is usually asymptomatic with parents unaware that their child is unwell. In community-based screening, some 20% to 30% of Aboriginal children have bulging eardrums. Only a minority have the typical symptoms (sudden onset of middle ear effusion with pain or fever) which define AOM in low-risk populations. To explain our findings in this high-risk population, we suggest that in placebo recipients, asymptomatic middle ear infection often progresses to AOM with perforation, whereas continuous amoxicillin helps to prevent that progression. This is consistent with our previous study of short-term antibiotics for asymptomatic AOM which indicated that the majority of children still satisfy the criteria for AOM despite treatment for 7 to 14 days. The present study suggests that therapy can be more successful if it is maintained long-term. We believe that this can be explained by the association of bacterial load with increased severity of OM. It may be that continuous antibiotics maintain bacterial load below a critical threshold for more severe disease.

### Impact of acute otitis media clinical practice guidelines on antibiotic and analgesic prescriptions: a systematic review [^f98e3ec7]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

With emerging antimicrobial resistance posing a serious threat to global public health, promoting judicious use of antibiotics has become a top priority for governments worldwide. As a consequence, clinical practice guidelines for common infectious diseases, including acute otitis media (AOM), have been introduced and updated in many countries over the past decades. Although AOM guidelines vary regarding specific recommendations across countries, they generally emphasise the importance of accurate diagnosis and adequate analgesia as well as advocating selective antibiotic prescribing.

It has been suggested that guideline adherence for AOM may be suboptimaldue to a variety of factors, such as fear of serious complications and parental pressure to prescribe antibiotics. In daily practice, antibiotics are commonly prescribed to children with AOM, ranging from around 50% in the Netherlandsto 80% in the USA, whereas analgesics are only recommended in a minority of cases.

However, the true impact of introducing AOM guidelines on prescription of antibiotics and analgesics for children with AOM in daily practice has not been reviewed systematically. We aim to do so and provide an overview of current available studies that compare prescription data before and after national AOM clinical practice guideline introduction.

### Treatment and prevention of otitis media [^70f046e8]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2000). Low credibility.

Objective

To review and summarize recent advances in the treatment and prevention of otitis media (OM).

Data Sources

A MEDLINE search (1996-March 2000) was performed to identify relevant primary and review articles. References from these articles were also reviewed if deemed important.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

English-language primary and review articles focusing on the treatment and prevention of acute otitis media (AOM) were included. Studies focusing exclusively on OM with effusion or serous OM and chronic suppurative OM were excluded. Information regarding prevention and drug therapy was reviewed, with an emphasis placed on advances made in the last two years.

Data Synthesis

Recently, an expert panel of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended use of only three of 16 systemic antibiotics approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treatment of AOM: amoxicillin, cefuroxime axetil, and ceftriaxone. Controversy exists over the importance of key selection factors used by the expert panel in determining which antibiotics to recommend in a two-step treatment algorithm, that is, in vitro data, pharmacodynamic profiles, and necessity for coverage of drug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae at all steps of empiric treatment. Additional antibiotic and patient selection factors useful for individualizing therapy include clinical efficacy, adverse effects, frequency and duration of administration, taste, cost, comorbid infections, and ramifications should bacterial resistance develop to the chosen antibiotic. Presumed or past patient/caregiver adherence (especially when antibiotic failure has occurred) is also paramount in selecting antibiotic therapy. A three-step treatment algorithm for refractory AOM that employs amoxicillin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX), or high-dose amoxicillin/clavulanate (depending on the prior dose of and adherence to amoxicillin therapy), and ceftriaxone or tympanocentesis at steps 1, 2, and 3, respectively, appears rational and cost-effective. The recent upsurge in antimicrobial resistance is highlighted, and recommendations are presented for the treatment of AOM and prevention of recurrent otitis media (rAOM).

Conclusions

Amoxicillin remains the antibiotic of choice for initial empiric treatment of AOM, although the traditional dosage should be increased in patients at risk for drug-resistant S. pneumoniae. In cases refractory to high-dose amoxicillin, TMP/SMX should be prescribed if adherence to prior therapy seemed good or complete, or high-dose amoxicillin/clavulanate if adherence was incomplete or questionable. Ceftriaxone should be reserved as third-line treatment. The increasing prevalence of drug-resistant S. pneumoniae emphasizes the importance of alternative medical approaches for the prevention of OM, as well as judicious antibiotic use in established cases. Removal of modifiable risk factors should be first-line therapy for prevention of rAOM. We support the use of conjugate pneumococcal vaccine per guidelines for prevention of rAOM from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practice of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, with consideration given to influenza vaccine for cases of rAOM that historically worsen during the flu season. Sulfisoxazole prophylaxis should be reserved for children who are immunocompromised, have concurrent disease states exacerbated by AOM, or meet the criteria of rAOM despite conjugate pneumococcal and influenza vaccination. Therapy should be intermittent, beginning at the first sign of an upper respiratory infection, and should continue for 10 days. The invasive nature and risks of anesthesia relegate myringotomy, tympanostomy tubes, and adenoidectomy to last-line therapies for rAOM.

### The diagnosis and management of acute otitis media [^f682a526]. Pediatrics (2013). Medium credibility.

American Academy of Pediatrics — acute otitis media (AOM) pain management states Key Action Statement 2: "The management of AOM should include an assessment of pain. If pain is present, the clinician should recommend treatment to reduce pain" with "Evidence Quality: Grade B, Rec. Strength: Strong Recommendation". Pain is the major symptom of AOM. Antibiotic therapy "does not provide symptomatic relief in the first 24 hours and even after 3 to 7 days, there may be persistent pain, fever, or both in 30% of children younger than 2 years", whereas "analgesics do relieve pain associated with AOM within 24 hours and should be used whether antibiotic therapy is or is not prescribed; they should be continued as long as needed". The management of pain "should be addressed regardless of the use of antibiotics", and "Treating pain is essential whether or not antibiotics are prescribed". Choice of analgesic is intentionally unspecified, and clinicians should select therapy on "the basis of a consideration of benefits and risks" and "incorporate parent/caregiver and patient preference". Topical analgesics are excluded "in the presence of a perforated TM".

### Durations of antibiotic treatment for acute otitis media and variability in prescribed durations across two large academic health systems [^c4cdd7bb]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2024). Medium credibility.

Table 2.
Antibiotic Treatment

Table 3.
Antibiotic Treatment by Location

Overall, most antibiotic prescriptions were for 10 days (n = 45 689; 75%), 20% were for 7 days (n = 12 060), and only 5% were for 5 days (n = 3144; Table 2 and Supplemental Table 3). Variability was observed between the two health systems: 10-day durations were more common at Washington University than VUMC (78% vs 70%) while 7-day prescriptions were more common at VUMC than Washington University (25% vs 17%; Table 3). However, the use of 5-day durations was infrequent at both (5% overall). There was also variability in prescribed durations within the systems. For example, at Washington University 10-day durations were more commonly prescribed in primary care clinics as compared with emergency departments, urgent care, and medical specialty clinics (Figure 2). In both health systems, 5-day durations were infrequent across all types of care locations. There was limited variability in prescribed durations across individual care locations and clinician type (Figure 3A and C); the mean duration at most sites was between 9 and 10 days. No sites had a mean duration of 7 days or less. In contrast, there was more variability among individual clinicians (Figure 3B). The mean prescribed duration was between 5 and 7 days for only 5.6% of clinicians (40/719 total; 21/329 [6.4%] at VUMC and 19/390 [4.9%] at Washington University).

### Updated guidelines for the management of acute otitis media in children by the Italian Society of Pediatrics: treatment [^a5c59683]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

New insights into the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of acute otitis media (AOM) have been gained in recent years. For this reason, the Italian Paediatric Society has updated its 2010 guidelines.

Methods

A literature search was carried out on PubMed. Only pediatric studies published between January 1, 2010 and December 31, 2018 in English or Italian were included. Each included study was assessed according to the GRADE methodology. The quality of the systematic reviews was assessed using AMSTAR 2. The recommendations were formulated by a multidisciplinary panel of experts.

Results

Prompt antibiotic treatment is recommended for children with otorrhea, intracranial complications and/or a history of recurrence and for children under the age of 6 months. For children 6 months to 2 years of age, prompt antibiotic treatment is recommended for all forms of unilateral and bilateral AOM, whether mild or severe. Prompt antibiotic treatment is also recommended for children over 2 years with severe bilateral AOM. A watchful-waiting approach can be applied to children over 2 years with mild or severe unilateral AOM or mild bilateral AOM. High doses of amoxicillin, or amoxicillin-clavulanic acid for patients with a high risk of infection by Beta-lactamase producing strains, remain the first-line antibiotics.

Conclusions

AOM should be managed on a case-by-case basis that takes account of the child's age, the severity of the episode and whether it is unilateral or bilateral. In patients under 2 years, prompt antibiotic treatment is always recommended.

### Trends in broad-spectrum antibiotic prescribing for children with acute otitis media in the United States, 1998–2004 [^70a0f838]. BMC Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

There were some aspects of the data that may limit the conclusions that can be drawn from our results. First, the NAMCS and NHAMCS survey format does not allow for direct linkage between diagnosis and medication. Even though we attempted to use a rigorous method for linking the antibiotic prescribed during a visit to an AOM diagnosis, it is possible that the antibiotics were actually prescribed for a different condition than was addressed in the visit. Second, as mentioned previously, multiple visits by the same individual are not accounted for because individual identifiers are not coded in NAMCS and NHAMCS. Lastly, we were unable to determine if high dose amoxicillin (80 to 90 mg/kg/day) was prescribed to children who received an amoxicillin prescription. High dose amoxicillin was recommended as first line treatment for AOM by a CDC consensus panel in 1999 due to concerns of drug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. It is possible that the rate of prescribing of high dose amoxicillin, in keeping with these guidelines, increased despite the overall stable trend in amoxicillin prescribing.

The CDC has championed national efforts to address antibiotic overuse through education of healthcare providers and the public. And although overall pediatric antibiotic prescribing rates and visits for AOM have decreased, it is concerning that prescribing for AOM, now known to be coupled with a high likelihood of a broad-spectrum antibiotic prescription, has not. Perhaps the best means of avoiding unnecessary broad-spectrum antibiotics for AOM is to limit those children receiving any antibiotic prescription. In this regard, we support the national AOM practice guidelines that allow for the option of observation as the first-line treatment of uncomplicated AOM in children with mild disease. These guidelines have been further supported by recent, randomized, controlled trials in multiple settings as well as several older metaanalyses. Adherence to the guidelines would not only directly decrease antibiotic prescriptions for broad-spectrum and other agents, but perhaps, also indirectly, as more parents came to learn that a doctor's visit is not always necessary when their child's symptoms are mild.

### The diagnosis and management of acute otitis media [^852bcc6d]. Pediatrics (2013). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis media (AOM) randomized trial protocol in toddlers — amoxicillin-clavulanate versus placebo — specified dose, population, definition, compliance, and outcome. Tähtinen et al conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, intention-to-treat study of amoxicillin-clavulanate (40 mg/kg/day) versus placebo. Three hundred nineteen patients from 6 to 35 months of age were studied: 161 in the antibiotic group and 158 in the placebo group. AOM definition was the presence of MEE, distinct erythema over a bulging or yellow TM, and acute symptoms such as ear pain, fever, or respiratory symptoms. Compliance was measured by using daily patient diaries and number of capsules remaining at the end of the study. Primary outcome was time to treatment failure defined as a composite of 6 independent components.

### The diagnosis and management of acute otitis media [^a771ec86]. Pediatrics (2013). Medium credibility.

Epidemiology of otitis media visits and prescribing — clinician visits for OM decreased from 950 per 1000 children in 1995–1996 to 634 per 1000 children in 2005–2006, with a proportional decrease in antibiotic prescriptions for OM from 760 per 1000 in 1995–1996 to 484 per 1000 in 2005–2006, while the percentage of OM visits resulting in antibiotic prescriptions remained relatively stable (80% in 1995–1996; 76% in 2005–2006).
