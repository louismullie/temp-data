## Question

When there is a post viral cough (not accompanied by any other symptom), when and what should someone give to alleviate it? Do ppi-s have relevance in this regard?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking when and what to give for a post-viral cough that is not accompanied by any other symptoms, and whether proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) have any role in alleviating it. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to classify the cough by duration and what that implies for etiology and management. Then, I should verify the pathophysiology of post-viral cough and whether it predicts response to therapy. Next, I will review the evidence for symptomatic treatments and their timing. After that, I need to check the evidence for PPIs in this exact scenario and in related contexts. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk–benefit recommendation and outline red flags and follow-up thresholds.

> Let me first confirm the classification by duration because that frames everything. A cough persisting after a viral upper respiratory infection is typically labeled subacute when it lasts 3 to 8 weeks, and chronic beyond 8 weeks; importantly, post-viral cough is common in the subacute window and is usually self-limited, with normal chest radiography expected in the absence of other symptoms, which supports a conservative approach initially [^115ThUt5] [^114iQQJf].

> I need to check the pathophysiology to avoid mismatched therapy. Post-viral cough reflects airway inflammation, epithelial injury, and cough receptor hypersensitivity rather than ongoing infection or acid reflux; this mechanistic profile helps explain why antibiotics are ineffective and why antitussives may only blunt symptoms rather than hasten resolution, reinforcing the principle of minimal, symptom-targeted care rather than disease-modifying therapy in this window [^114iQQJf] [^111Qx1fp].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about symptomatic treatment; I should verify what actually helps. For adults with bothersome post-viral cough, short-term use of a first-generation antihistamine/decongestant combination can reduce cough frequency and severity in some patients, likely via anticholinergic and decongestant effects; inhaled ipratropium may also attenuate cough in subacute post-infectious states, though evidence quality is limited and benefits are modest, so expectations should be tempered and use individualized [^1154pf7d] [^114iQQJf]. Wait, let me verify the role of NSAIDs; naproxen has been suggested to favorably affect cough in viral URTI, but data are sparse and heterogeneous, so I should frame NSAIDs as optional for analgesic or anti-inflammatory relief rather than as a cough-specific therapy, and avoid implying disease modification [^113KthhB] [^1154pf7d].

> I should confirm what to avoid. Codeine and dextromethorphan have limited benefit for viral cough and carry adverse effect risks, so routine use is not recommended; similarly, antibiotics are inappropriate in the absence of bacterial infection, and over-the-counter cough and cold medicines have not shown clear benefit and should generally be avoided in children and used cautiously in adults given safety concerns and lack of efficacy data [^113KthhB] [^116kdHdf] [^114iQQJf].

> Now, I will examine the crux: do PPIs help a post-viral cough with no other symptoms. The answer is no. Multiple high-quality guidelines and randomized trials show that empiric PPIs do not improve chronic or unexplained cough when typical GERD symptoms are absent and when reflux workup is negative; this applies even more to isolated post-viral cough, which lacks reflux features by definition [^111QAu5c] [^116zZTaC] [^116Kpk9M]. Let me double-check the magnitude and direction of effect; pooled analyses and large RCTs in unexplained chronic cough show no significant benefit of PPIs over placebo, and in some studies patients on PPIs fared worse than placebo, underscoring harm without benefit in this context [^116wzhRC] [^115ChtVG]. But wait, what if there is silent reflux? Even in suspected reflux-cough syndrome without heartburn, guidelines recommend against PPI monotherapy because it is unlikely to help, and they advise reserving PPIs for patients with concomitant typical GERD symptoms and integrating lifestyle measures rather than using acid suppression alone [^116KjhJS] [^1124ADzw].

> I should confirm pediatric implications separately. In children, GERD is not a common cause of isolated chronic cough, and empiric PPIs for cough outcomes are not recommended; meta-analytic data show no benefit and potential harm, so PPIs should be avoided for cough unless there are clear GERD features managed per pediatric GERD guidance [^116upLpz] [^114ewgqm].

> Let me synthesize timing and what to give. For a post-viral cough without other symptoms, reassurance and watchful waiting are first-line through the subacute window; if cough is bothersome, a time-limited trial of a first-generation antihistamine/decongestant or inhaled ipratropium can be considered for adults, typically for 1 to 2 weeks, with discontinuation if ineffective; beyond 8 weeks, or if red flags emerge, I should pivot to a structured chronic cough evaluation rather than escalating empiric therapy [^114z828C] [^1154pf7d] [^114iQQJf]. I need to ensure I set expectations: most post-viral coughs resolve spontaneously by 8 weeks, so persistent symptoms warrant reassessment for alternative etiologies rather than prolonged empiric trials [^114iQQJf].

> I should double-check safety and stewardship. Long-term or unnecessary PPI use exposes patients to risks without benefit in this setting, and deprescribing principles support stopping PPIs when there is no objective GERD indication; this aligns with gastroenterology guidance to avoid empiric PPIs for extraesophageal symptoms without typical reflux features and to pursue objective testing if reflux remains strongly suspected despite negative response [^1131cXSG] [^116Noc48].

> Next, I should review red flags and follow-up. Persistent cough beyond 8 weeks, hemoptysis, weight loss, night sweats, fever, dyspnea, or focal lung findings should prompt chest imaging and a guideline-based chronic cough workup; in children, chronic cough beyond 4 weeks merits evaluation per pediatric algorithms, with asthma medications avoided unless there is evidence of asthma [^114z828C] [^1143FvUM].

> Bottom line, I need to be explicit. For a post-viral cough with no other symptoms, do not use PPIs; they have no proven benefit and may cause harm. Reserve PPIs for patients with concomitant typical GERD symptoms and manage reflux comprehensively rather than with acid suppression alone. In the meantime, use minimal, time-limited symptomatic therapy or no therapy, and reassess if cough persists beyond 8 weeks or if new symptoms arise [^111QAu5c] [^116Kpk9M] [^1124ADzw].

---

For isolated post-viral cough (no other symptoms), **no treatment is needed** in most cases, as it typically resolves within 3–8 weeks [^114iQQJf]. If cough is bothersome, use **symptomatic therapy** (dextromethorphan, guaifenesin, or a first-generation antihistamine/decongestant) for short-term relief [^1154pf7d]. PPIs are **not indicated** unless there are clear GERD features; empiric PPIs do not help isolated post-viral cough and should be avoided [^111QAu5c] [^116zZTaC]. Reserve further workup for cough persisting beyond 8 weeks or if red flags appear [^114z828C].

---

## Clinical course and natural history

Post-viral cough typically lasts 3–8 weeks and is **self-limited**, resolving spontaneously; persistence beyond 8 weeks warrants evaluation for chronic cough etiologies [^114z828C] [^114iQQJf].

---

## Symptomatic management

Symptomatic therapy can reduce cough severity and improve quality of life, though benefits are modest and variable:

- **Dextromethorphan**: A central cough suppressant that can reduce cough frequency and severity [^notfound].
- **Guaifenesin**: An expectorant that may thin secretions and reduce cough effort.
- **First-generation antihistamine/decongestant combinations**: Useful if upper airway cough syndrome is suspected (e.g. chlorpheniramine with pseudoephedrine) [^1154pf7d].

These therapies are **short-term** (≤ 2 weeks) and should be discontinued if ineffective or if adverse effects occur.

---

## Role of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs)

PPIs are **not indicated** for isolated post-viral cough without GERD symptoms. Evidence shows no benefit of empiric PPIs for unexplained chronic cough or post-viral cough, and guidelines recommend against their use in the absence of GERD features [^111QAu5c] [^116zZTaC] [^116Kpk9M]. PPIs should be considered only when typical GERD symptoms (heartburn, regurgitation) are present or when objective reflux is documented [^116Noc48].

---

## When to consider further evaluation

Further evaluation is indicated if:

- **Cough persists beyond 8 weeks** (chronic cough) [^114z828C].
- **Red flag symptoms** are present (hemoptysis, weight loss, night sweats, dyspnea, chest pain) [^notfound].
- **Signs of underlying disease** are present (wheezing, stridor, clubbing, cyanosis) [^notfound].

Evaluation should follow guideline-based algorithms, assessing for common chronic cough causes (UACS, asthma, GERD, NAEB) [^111guthx].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended management** |
|-|-|
| Isolated post-viral cough (< 8 weeks) | - No routine treatment <br/> - Symptomatic therapy if bothersome (dextromethorphan, guaifenesin, or first-generation antihistamine/decongestant) [^1154pf7d] |
| Cough persists > 8 weeks or red flags present | - Guideline-based evaluation for chronic cough [^111guthx] <br/> - Avoid empiric PPIs unless GERD features are present [^111QAu5c] [^116Noc48] |
| GERD features present (heartburn, regurgitation) | - Consider PPI trial with lifestyle measures [^1124ADzw] <br/> - Objective reflux testing if refractory [^116Noc48] |

---

Isolated post-viral cough is **self-limited**; use symptomatic therapy if needed and avoid PPIs unless GERD is present. Escalate evaluation only if cough persists beyond 8 weeks or if red flags arise.

### Chronic cough after acute viral bronchiolitis: suggestions… [^116jZDoy]. AAFP (2019). Medium credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- Children with chronic cough after acute viral bronchiolitis should be evaluated for cough pointers that reveal an underlying cause.
- Asthma medications should not be used unless asthma symptoms are present.
- Inhaled hypertonic saline should not be used for chronic cough after viral bronchiolitis. To address the high prevalence of bronchiolitis, the effects of chronic cough on patients' quality of life, and adverse effects from inappropriate use of medications, an expert panel from the American College of Chest Physicians performed systematic reviews to develop several consensus-based suggestions. The panel used the population, intervention, comparison, and outcome framework to address the following key questions: Are antibiotics effective in improving the resolution of cough in children with chronic cough after acute viral bronchiolitis. If so, which antibiotics and for how long. Are asthma medications effective in improving the resolution of cough in children with chronic cough after acute viral bronchiolitis. If so, which ones and for how long. Are inhaled osmotic agents effective in improving the resolution of cough in children with chronic cough after acute viral bronchiolitis. Although the panel found several studies and systematic reviews on the effectiveness of the three types of interventions, no data were relevant to the key questions. Therefore, no recommendations could be made, only the following suggestions: In children with chronic cough after acute viral bronchiolitis, the panel suggests that the cough be managed according to the CHEST pediatric chronic cough guidelines. This includes evaluation for cough pointers to identify a specific cause and treating children who have a wet/productive cough with no specific etiology with a two-week course of antibiotics targeted to common respiratory bacteria based on local sensitivities. In children with chronic cough after acute viral bronchiolitis, the panel suggests that asthma medications not be used unless other evidence of asthma is present.

Objectives

To impart a call for further research into the identified domains of particular interest in the etiology, management, and treatment of cough.

Design/Methodology

A literature review was performed using the search term "cough" in PubMed between 1983 and 2004. The final draft of this guideline was reviewed, in addition to recent studies on cough, and suggestions provided by the authors were collated into a definitive inventory of specific areas in which the lack of quality evidence encumbered the development of clinically relevant evidence-based recommendations.

Results/Conclusions

Although our understanding of the causes and optimal management of chronic cough have significantly increased over the past 25 years, further research remains to be done on this common symptom. This is reflected by the generally low level of evidence for many of the recommendations in these guidelines. Research is particularly needed on the optimal treatment of postinfectious cough, how to distinguish acute bronchitis from other conditions, how to reliably diagnose and treat cough due to gastroesophageal reflux disease, clearly identifying a role for nonpharmacologic protussive treatment modalities in diseases associated with an increased production of bronchial secretions, determining how often cough in patients with interstitial lung disease is due to conditions other than these, establishing the spectrum and frequency of causes of chronic cough in the immunocompromised hosts, and better characterizing psychogenic cough. Further studies are also needed on methods for the assessment of cough, in particular, noninvasive measures of airway inflammation, and pharmacotherapy. It should be determined how often unexplained cough (previously referred to as idiopathic cough) is due to the use of non-evidence-based guidelines or to environmental causes, and assessed whether an empiric, integrative approach of diagnosing chronic cough leads to better outcomes, including cost-effectiveness, than routine testing. While much work has been done on chronic cough, we need studies on the spectrum and frequency of acute and subacute coughs.

### How does rhinovirus cause the common cold cough? [^113KthhB]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2016). Medium credibility.

Summary

A postviral cough is generally unresponsive to conventional pharmacological intervention, but has shown limited responsiveness to the anticholinergic drug, tiotropium, which leaves a major hole in our therapeutic armamentarium. Currently, treatment merely consists of dampening the inflammatory response with the use of antiinflammatories (such as naproxen), and cough suppressants (codeine-containing products and dextromethorphan), in the hope of reducing the frequency, severity and transmission of cough. Opiates, although commonly prescribed, are not generally recommended for viral cough due to their poor efficacy and significant adverse effect profile.

The multiple mechanisms described above provide a confusing and inter-related 'soup' of potential therapeutic targets, dissecting which, are the key players involved in this common affliction that will be challenging. We suggest that modulation of the afferent neuronal hypersensitivity will provide the most fruitful target in what is essentially a benign and self-limiting disease. Other strategies, such as systemic immune modulation, run the risk of generating unforeseen off-target effects. The rewards for understanding the mechanism of viral-induced cough will have enormous impact on human morbidity.

Discussion

This study found that lansoprazole offers no benefit over placebo for patients with persistent throat symptoms. No trends were in favour of lansoprazole. Patients who received lansoprazole on average reported worse improvement in symptoms than those receiving placebo. Treating patients for reported persistent throat symptoms "empirically" with PPIs, in the absence of specialist investigations, is common practice by healthcare practitioners worldwide. This should now be discouraged through evidence based treatment guidelines. Recent guidelines on chronic cough, which previously advocated trials of PPIs for presumed reflux related symptoms, have incorporated high level evidence and placebo controlled trials of PPIs and now state that acid reduction treatments should not be routinely prescribed for this condition.

The practice of prescribing PPIs for these patients is based on several observational cases series showing improvement in symptoms over time with treatment. The inability of placebo controlled trials to replicate the benefits of PPIs in uncontrolled observational studies, however, suggests a misattribution of placebo enhanced spontaneous resolution in such single cohort reports. A systematic review of studies that used PPIs as empirical treatment for suspected reflux related throat symptoms identified 14 uncontrolled studies, one non-blind, non-randomised study with a control group of healthy volunteers, and six double blind, placebo controlled randomised trials from 1994 to 2004. A lack of common outcome measures, potential selection bias, or inadequate blinding of the results were among typical limitations. An updated meta-analysis to 2005 of eight randomised controlled trials concluded that PPI treatment "may offer a modest but non-significant clinical benefit" over placebo. A previous trial randomised 145 patients in a 2:1 ratio to esomeprazole twice daily or matched placebo twice daily. The participants completed a Likert scale assessment of five symptoms: throat clearing, cough, globus, sore throat, and hoarseness. The participants identified their single most bothersome symptom at baseline. The primary outcome measure was the percentage of participants who had resolution of their most troublesome symptom. No difference was found between the treatment groups for the primary outcome measure, nor in secondary outcomes of laryngeal appearances, pH monitoring, or disease specific quality of life (laryngopharyngeal health related quality of life). Although discussions about methodology could be raised, it is difficult to conclude why this study did not diminish the enthusiasm for PPI use in this patient population. In our multicentre trial, we used a validated symptom reporting outcome. It is imperative that high quality clinical trials with negative outcomes, such as our trial, are incorporated into evidence based guidelines to bring about practice change. Our trial provides evidence for the medical profession to question indiscriminate use of PPIs and change empirical practices.

The pathogenesis and clinical features of gastro-oesophageal reflux related cough are complex and the diagnostic tests available are of limited reliability. Treatment needs to be tailored to the specific needs of individual patients and other possible causes of chronic cough should be investigated. Treatment should only be considered to have failed when cough persists after administration of proton pump inhibitors at an adequate dosage for a sufficient length of time.

Results — evidence identification and RCT characteristics — For PICO question 1, the search initially identified 1,870 citations; after the removal of 354 duplicates, 1,516 records were screened, with 541 excluded for irrelevant titles and 119 for pediatrics; hence, 842 abstracts were reviewed; among these, 14 full-text articles were assessed for eligibility and deemed pertinent for qualitative synthesis for inclusion; the additional seven studies for PICO question 2 were identified in a recent publication. We identified relatively few RCTs addressing antireflux therapy for chronic cough, and there was variability in how typical features or objective measures of reflux disease were used as inclusion or exclusion criteria. With respect to the treatment arms, they were all placebo controlled with respect to the primary intervention (PPIs in 11 of 14 cases). None of these were surgical trials. Observations included that there was a strong placebo effect for cough improvement, and studies including lifestyle modification and weight loss had better cough outcomes.

### When is proton pump inhibitor use appropriate? [^112YncNM]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

The role of PPI therapy for managing extra-esophageal symptoms that are potentially from gastroesophageal reflux is even more perplexing. Scarpignato et al. highlight the paucity of high-quality data regarding PPI therapy for non-cardiac chest pain, laryngeal complaints, asthma, dental erosions, and chronic cough. Paradoxically, this has led to the widespread practice of treating these conditions with high doses of PPIs for extended periods of time. Furthermore, with no specified alternative management strategy, this frequently leads to long-term high-dose PPI usage in these conditions regardless of effectiveness. More than any, these patients benefit from further physiological investigation (manometry, reflux monitoring) to either implicate PPI-refractory GERD as a cause of their symptoms or to justify PPI discontinuation. Based on personal experience, the appropriate intervention is often PPI discontinuation in patients with isolated extra-esophageal symptoms that have not responded to a PPI trial. Continuing PPI therapy in such circumstances provides no benefit and simply exposes patients to the risk of therapy, the other focus to the Scarpignato review.

The list of safety concerns related to long-term PPI use is growing, both in number and in public visibility. Although largely based on low quality data and, in many instances, refuted by higher quality data, the warnings are out there on the TV, the internet, and the package inserts. This has resulted in widespread PPI angst among patients and not a day goes by that this is not the topic of a patient consultation in a specialty gastrointestinal disorders practice. Scarpignato et al. comprehensively review both the digestive and extra-digestive concerns about PPI usage, but ultimately reiterate that PPIs are well tolerated and that the benefits of PPI treatment outweigh potential risks when PPIs are used for an appropriate indication. Table 2 summarizes available safety information on long-term PPI use with the concerns grouped by the strength of substantiating data and significance. Evident in the table, there is little there of sufficient concern to alter practice, providing that PPI use is appropriate.

### Is empiric proton pump inhibition in patients with symptoms of extraesophageal gastroesophageal reflux justified? [^111fJA2F]. BMC Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

The rationale for empirical PPI treatment

Due to the low cost and practical convenience of prescribing a PPI trial course against symptoms of suspected EE reflux, this may be chosen instead of initial pretreatment diagnostic investigations. Such strategy may be supported by several guidelines including the recent AGA publication that recommended a PPI trial of 12 weeks. However, initial testing was recommended to be tailored to the patients clinical presentation as well as in patients who fail a PPI trial and experts are divided.

Although reflux may cause EE symptoms, it is uncommon for reflux to be the dominant cause in patients not also experiencing typical esophageal symptoms and there is little evidence to support that PPI treatment is better than placebo in this patient group. There is some evidence from an RCTs that rabeprazole 20 mg twice daily was significantly better than placebo in patients selected based on symptoms, videostroboscopic evidence of LPR and RFS. A reduction in RFS and RSI was also reported in patients receiving esomeprazole 20 mg twice daily for three months. One study has found that symptoms of postnasal drainage improved after 8 to 16 weeks of lansoprazole 30 mg twice daily compared to placebo. However, several other studies have not found effects of pantoprazole or rabeprazole 20 mg twice daily. In a randomized clinical trial comparing esomeprazole 40 mg twice daily with placebo did not find any benefits in patients with chronic posterior laryngitis. Notably, this study purposely excluded patients with frequent heartburn. In a meta-analysis containing 480 patients from 10 RCTs there was a minor effect of PPI compared to placebo (RR 1.31, 95%CI 1.03–1.67) and interestingly the preplanned analysis of the effects of PPI treatment without dietary and lifestyle modifications did not reach statistical significance. In patients with chronic cough there are no high-quality studies that support that PPI therapy has a benefit. This further weakens the arguments of an initial PPI trial.

### Therapy insight: treatment of gastroesophageal reflux in adults with chronic cough [^113rwi54]. Nature Clinical Practice: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2007). Medium credibility.

Gastroesophageal reflux (GER) is the second most common cause of chronic cough in immunocompetent patients who are nonsmokers, not on angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors and have normal chest radiographs. Identification of GER in chronic cough patients can be difficult; most patients with GER-related cough have no esophageal symptoms and no esophageal test is adequate to make this diagnosis. Post-hoc analysis of four prospective intervention trials has identified a clinical patient profile that can predict the presence of GER-related cough 91% of the time. Clinical practice guidelines from the American College of Chest Physicians and the British Thoracic Society recommend initiating an initial empiric GER therapy trial, with esophageal testing being reserved for nonresponders. The empiric trial should include conservative measures and PPIs twice daily for 3 months. Selected patients who have dysphagia might benefit from the addition of a prokinetic agent. Esophageal manometry and pH testing with impedance monitoring (if available) should be performed in nonresponders while they are on therapy. It can take more than 50 days for cough to respond to medical GER therapy. Surgical fundoplication might be helpful in very carefully selected patients. Careful evaluation and treatment resolves cough in approximately 80% of patients with GER-related cough.

Intervention fidelity is emphasized and is defined "as the extent to which an intervention was delivered as conceived and planned-to arrive at valid conclusions concerning its effectiveness in achieving target outcomes".

### AGA clinical practice update on the diagnosis and management of extraesophageal gastroesophageal reflux disease: expert review [^113ADDgY]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) effectiveness for extraesophageal manifestations — meta-analyses show no advantage for PPIs over placebo for suspected GERD-related chronic laryngitis (relative risk, 1.28; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.94–1.74) and no clear benefit for chronic cough, while in asthma a small mean improvement in morning peak expiratory flow (mean difference, 8.68 L/min; 95% CI, 2.35–15.02) was deemed unlikely to be clinically meaningful, and empirical PPI use for routine asthma treatment was not endorsed.

### Proton pump inhibitors in allergy: benefits and risks [^113CQhRn]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2022). Medium credibility.

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are widely prescribed and are indicated for the treatment of several gastrointestinal disorders. Allergists may prescribe PPIs as a result of the coincidence of gastroesophageal reflux disease with asthma or rhinitis, or when gastroesophageal reflux disease presents as chronic cough. Furthermore, long-term, high-dose PPI therapy is a recommended option for managing eosinophilic esophagitis, resulting in histologic remission in approximately 40% of patients. Here, we discuss current recommendations for PPI use, its deescalation, and its side effect profile. We review evidence supporting the epidemiologic link between the use of acid-suppressant medication and the subsequent development of allergic disorders.

### Somatically evoked cough responses help to identify patients with difficult-to-treat chronic cough: a six-month observational cohort study [^113m2az5]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

The association between chronic cough and its commonest causeswas established clinically and by using the results of recommended tests. Thus, classic asthma was suspected when patients reported wheezing or chest tightness or both, with and without reversible airway obstruction. Gastro-oesophageal reflux was suspected when at least one oesophageal symptom was reported, with or without one or more of the commonest extra-oesophageal manifestations. Finally, an upper airway cough syndrome was suspected when patients reported nasal obstruction and/or post-nasal drip episodes with or without throat clearing. In all instances, pharmacological treatments (Supplementary Table S1) were recommended according to current guidelines; furthermore, patients received personalised lifestyle suggestions when appropriate. In brief, treatments also included acid-suppressing drugs (proton pump inhibitors and antacid drugs often associated with prokinetic drugs, n = 95), inhaled/oral steroids associated with long-acting bronchodilators (n = 38), nasal lavages, and steroids and/or antihistamines (n = 21). Combinations of drugs were prescribed in the remaining 151/317 patients due to the detection of multiple, putative cough-accompanying symptoms. In twelve patients (7 SPC+), cough was the sole clinically apparent disturbance and they were treated with cough suppressants such as Gabapentin, central (Codeine) or peripheral (Levodropropizine) antitussive medicines. For each patient, three follow-up visits were scheduled approximately 2 months apart; however, it was possible to anticipate the end of follow-up when the cough score was 1 (i.e. "cough bothers me very little") or less.

### Comprehensive evidence-based review on European antitussives [^116C3ZhR]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2016). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Acute cough is perhaps the most common symptom to afflict mankind. While it is usually a benign and self-limiting illness, the amount of morbidity endured as a consequence of acute viral respiratory tract infection has enormous consequences on humanity. By the use of evidence-based treatment, significant improvement in patient outcomes can be achieved. While there are many gaps in the knowledge of our therapy in acute cough, our improved understanding of the mechanism of cough hypersensitivity brings rational treatment choices a step closer. A greater understanding of how drugs may normalise this aberrant reflex, thus bringing relief and shortening the duration of illness, may be of enormous benefit to the whole of society.

### Treatment of unexplained chronic cough: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^113VaoSc]. Chest (2016). Medium credibility.

Unexplained chronic cough (UCC) — clinical trial design considerations — include that the ideal clinical trial patient population was considered to have UCC or refractory chronic cough, assessed according to guidelines, with participants not taking an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and being nonsmokers; the diagnostic criteria must be carefully determined and adherence to an assessment manual is required. For coexisting conditions, drugs such as proton pump inhibitors for gastroesophageal reflux disease are considered permissible as long as they are used at a stable dose, and participants require exclusion of significant chronic respiratory disease, such as chronic asthma, COPD, or bronchiectasis, with sufficient and measurable cough severity at entry to ensure a homogeneous study population. There can be a significant placebo effect in cough trials. The CHEST Cough Expert Panel has recommended quality of life as the primary study outcome, and in adults the cough-specific quality-of-life questionnaire or the Leicester Cough Questionnaire is recommended. For chronic cough, either a parallel-group or crossover design is possible, whereas for acute or subacute cough a parallel-group design is preferable because of a significant natural recovery.

### Treatment of unexplained chronic cough: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^112jkGbt]. Chest (2016). Medium credibility.

Unexplained chronic cough (UCC) therapy — Neuromodulator therapy was found to significantly improve cough quality of life in three RCTs, with studies using gabapentin or morphine, and the largest study found that gabapentin reduced cough frequency in UCC. A treatment suggestion regarding neuromodulators for UCC recognized limitations including the paucity and small size of studies and that one of the three RCTs had a moderate risk of bias, making the estimate of treatment effect imprecise; adverse effects were mainly predictable central nervous system effects, and for gabapentin were reportedly managed by modification to dose. Speech pathology was found to have a positive effect on cough severity and in an open-label study showed positive effects on cough quality of life and objective cough counts. Proton pump inhibitors are recommended for chronic cough caused by GERD, but in the absence of typical GERD symptoms an RCT found the empiric use of a high-dose proton pump inhibitor was not effective at improving cough quality of life, and macrolides did not improve quality of life in patients with UCC.

There is increasing concern among patients and health care providers about the associations between PPI use and a multitude of potential adverse outcomes. Therefore, clinicians need to have a rational approach both to identifying PPI users who may not have an ongoing indication for their use and on how to encourage discontinuation of unnecessary PPI use. In this paper, we will provide a detailed review of the specific indications where the benefits of ongoing PPI use is of questionable value and will review the evidence on how to maximize the likelihood of being able to successfully discontinue PPI use while minimizing symptom recurrence.

### Use of proton pump inhibitors to treat persistent throat symptoms: multicentre, double blind, randomised, placebo controlled trial [^117Nu3yH]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Persistent throat symptoms are a common presentation in primary and secondary care and principally comprise hoarseness; the sensation of a lump in the throat (globus); repeated throat clearing; mucus in the throat, or "catarrh"; cough; and throat discomfort. The prevalence of globus alone in middle aged women is about 6%, with a lifetime ever population incidence of more than 40%. A quarter of patients attending primary care for other conditions might report major throat symptoms when questioned.

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GORD) affects up to 20% of the Western population. An association between GORD and throat and voice symptoms is widely cited — a decade ago more than half of British otolaryngologists prescribed proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) for throat symptoms.GORD and related symptoms have been described using a variety of terms, including extraoesophageal reflux, laryngopharyngeal reflux, and reflux laryngitis. The concept of a link between GORD and throat and voice symptoms has since become even more popular, with open access primary care guidelines advocating PPI treatment. The few randomised controlled trials that have compared PPIs with placebo are heterogeneous and generally underpowered. By far the largest controlled trial included 145 patientsand found no benefit from treating suspected reflux laryngitis with PPIs twice daily compared with placebo twice daily. Despite variable quality, recent meta-analyses of small randomised controlled trials indicate either no benefitor mild superiorityof PPIs over placebo. Increasing use of PPIs, at cost to the National Health Service, has become the default treatment for persistent throat symptoms in primary and secondary care without robust evidence. Inappropriate use of PPIs is a major healthcare concern and contributes to polypharmacy, risk of drug interactions, and risk of side effects. A US study found that the cost of treating extraoesophageal reflux symptoms in 281 patients was more than fivefold that of the estimated cost of treating patients with traditional GORD symptoms, with more than 50% of these costs attributed to prescriptions for PPIs.

We investigated the role of PPIs as pragmatic preferred treatment for throat symptoms in primary and secondary care.

### Subacute cough… [^1154pf7d]. AAFP (2007). Low credibility.

If the cough is due to the common cold, a first-generation antihistamine plus a decongestant should be prescribed. It has been shown that naproxen favorably affects cough. Newer-generation nonsedating antihistamines are not effective for reducing cough. Patients must be symptomatic for a least one week before a diagnosis of bacterial sinusitis is made, because prior to that point bacterial overgrowth is unlikely. Subacute Cough The first step in diagnosing subacute cough is to determine whether the cough has followed a respiratory infection. If the cough does not appear to be postinfectious, it should be managed as if it were a chronic cough. Patients suspected of being infected with B. pertussis should have a nasopharyngeal swab for culture. Patients with confirmed whooping cough should receive macrolide antibiotics and should be isolated for five days beginning on the first day of treatment. If the cough is not caused by bacterial sinusitis or.

Bordetella pertussis, treatment with inhaled ipratropium should be initiated to attenuate the cough. If the cough persists, consider the use of inhaled corticosteroids. If the cough is severe, consider prescribing 30 to 40 mg of prednisone per day for a brief period. When other treatments fail, codeine or dextromethorphan should be considered. UPPER AIRWAY COUGH SYNDROME–INDUCED CHRONIC COUGH Patients with chronic cough should first be treated with a first-generation antihistamine/decongestant. If the patient has complete or partial resolution of cough after one to two weeks of antihistamine/decongestant therapy, then it is assumed that upper airway cough syndrome was the cause and therapy should be continued. If the patient has persistent nasal symptoms, it is appropriate to begin a topical nasal steroid. If symptoms still persist, it is an indication for sinus imaging.

In patients who do not respond or cannot take inhaled medication, treatment with oral corticosteroids for five to 10 days is an option. Because oral leukotriene inhibitors may be effective, consideration should be given to adding a leukotriene inhibitor before an oral corticosteroid. If treatment for upper airway cough syndrome and asthma have both failed, nonasthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis should be considered next.

### American Gastroenterological Association medical position statement on the management of gastroesophageal reflux disease [^111mG7Qi]. Gastroenterology (2008). Medium credibility.

Extraesophageal reflux syndromes — continuation, discontinuation, and step-down of proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy are tied to concomitant esophageal disease and response. Many patients will have persistent symptoms after 8 weeks of empirical PPI therapy. The need for continued PPI therapy is predicated on the presence and severity of concomitant esophageal syndromes. In the absence of concomitant esophageal GERD syndromes, PPI therapy should be discontinued and other diagnostic and/or therapeutic avenues pursued. There are no trials showing the effectiveness of maintenance therapy for patients in whom empirical therapy with twice-daily PPI therapy results in improvement of asthma, cough, or laryngitis. Step-down therapy should be attempted, but the likelihood of symptom recurrence with step-down therapy in patients with extraesophageal reflux syndrome is currently unknown.

### Classification of cough as a symptom in adults and management algorithms: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^115JuhHm]. Chest (2018). Low credibility.

Background

We performed systematic reviews using the population, intervention, comparison, outcome (PICO) format to answer the following key clinical question: Are the CHEST 2006 classifications of acute, subacute and chronic cough and associated management algorithms in adults that were based on durations of cough useful?

Methods

We used the CHEST Expert Cough Panel's protocol for the systematic reviews and the American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST) methodological guidelines and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation framework. Data from the systematic reviews in conjunction with patient values and preferences and the clinical context were used to form recommendations or suggestions. Delphi methodology was used to obtain the final grading.

Results

With respect to acute cough (< 3 weeks), only three studies met our criteria for quality assessment, and all had a high risk of bias. As predicted by the 2006 CHEST Cough Guidelines, the most common causes were respiratory infections, most likely of viral cause, followed by exacerbations of underlying diseases such as asthma and COPD and pneumonia. The subjects resided on three continents: North America, Europe, and Asia. With respect to subacute cough (duration, 3–8 weeks), only two studies met our criteria for quality assessment, and both had a high risk of bias. As predicted by the 2006 guidelines, the most common causes were postinfectious cough and exacerbation of underlying diseases such as asthma, COPD, and upper airway cough syndrome (UACS). The subjects resided in countries in Asia. With respect to chronic cough (> 8 weeks), 11 studies met our criteria for quality assessment, and all had a high risk of bias. As predicted by the 2006 guidelines, the most common causes were UACS from rhinosinus conditions, asthma, gastroesophageal reflux disease, nonasthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis, combinations of these four conditions, and, less commonly, a variety of miscellaneous conditions and atopic cough in Asian countries. The subjects resided on four continents: North America, South America, Europe, and Asia.

Conclusions

Although the quality of evidence was low, the published literature since 2006 suggests that CHEST's 2006 Cough Guidelines and management algorithms for acute, subacute, and chronic cough in adults appeared useful in diagnosing and treating patients with cough around the globe. These same algorithms have been updated to reflect the advances in cough management as of 2017.

### Chronic cough due to gastroesophageal reflux in adults: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^114Hox55]. Chest (2016). Medium credibility.

Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy for chronic cough attributed to gastroesophageal reflux — trial findings and bias — are summarized as follows. Only one study (#13) showed a significant benefit in cough outcome when comparing PPI to placebo and this was an LPR study using nonstandard definitions of chronic cough and cough severity. The authors conclude that although lifestyle modifications and diet may be beneficial in controlling suspected reflux-cough syndrome, PPIs did not augment this, and PPIs demonstrated no benefit when used in isolation. Most RCTs focused on populations other than adult patients with more than an 8-week history of refractory chronic cough, most commonly LPR, which severely limited external validity. Risk of bias could be assessed in only three studies (#6, #11, and #12); one abstract reported only 19 patients allocated to four treatment groups, making it severely underpowered. Study #6 reported a negative result for PPI treatment without associated dietary and lifestyle modifications in a "silent reflux population" and excluded patients reporting heartburn > 2 times per month. Study #11 reported a strong placebo effect but no treatment benefit in a PPI trial selecting patients with a "reflux-related cough" defined by cough on phonation or on bending in association with food and eating with or without heartburn, and those criteria have not been validated, giving an uncertain risk of bias. Although heavy voice use has been implicated as a cough-provoking irritant, phonation stimulates upper esophageal sphincter contraction, arguing against reflux being the operant mechanism for that. Overall, the panel found no studies (positive or negative) pertinent to PICO question #1 with a low risk of bias.

### Postinfectious cough: ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^114iQQJf]. Chest (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Patients who complain of a persistent cough lasting > 3 weeks after experiencing the acute symptoms of an upper respiratory tract infection may have a postinfectious cough. Such patients are considered to have a subacute cough because the condition lasts for no > 8 weeks. The chest radiograph findings are normal, thus ruling out pneumonia, and the cough eventually resolves, usually on its own. The purpose of this review is to present the evidence for the diagnosis and treatment of postinfectious cough, including the most virulent form caused by Bordetella pertussis infection, and make recommendations that will be useful for clinical practice.

Methods

Recommendations for this section of the guideline were obtained from data using a National Library of Medicine (PubMed) search dating back to 1950, which was performed in August 2004, of the literature published in the English language. The search was limited to human studies, using the search terms "cough", "postinfectious cough", "postviral cough", "Bordetella pertussis", "pertussis infection", and "whooping cough".

Results

The pathogenesis of the postinfectious cough is not known, but it is thought to be due to the extensive inflammation and disruption of upper and/or lower airway epithelial integrity. When postinfectious cough emanates from the lower airway, this is often associated with the accumulation of an excessive amount of mucus hypersecretion and/or transient airway and cough receptor hyperresponsiveness; all may contribute to the subacute cough. In these patients, the optimal treatment is not known. Except for bacterial sinusitis or early on in a B pertussis infection, therapy with antibiotics has no role, as the cause is not bacterial infection. The use of inhaled ipratropium may be helpful. Other causes of postinfectious cough are persistent inflammation of the nose and paranasal sinuses, which leads to an upper airway cough syndrome (previously referred to as postnasal drip syndrome), and gastroesophageal reflux disease, which may be a complication of the vigorous coughing. One type of postinfectious cough that is particularly virulent is that caused by B pertussis infection. When the cough is accompanied by paroxysms of coughing, posttussive vomiting, and/or an inspiratory whooping sound, the diagnosis of a B pertussis infection should be made unless another diagnosis is proven. This infection is highly contagious but responds to antibiotic coverage with an oral macrolide when administered early in the course of the disease. A safe and effective vaccine to prevent B pertussis is now available for adults as well as children. It is recommended according to CDC guidelines.

Conclusions

In patients who have a cough lasting from 3 to 8 weeks with normal chest radiograph findings, consider the diagnosis of postinfectious cough. In most patients, a specific etiologic agent will not be identified, and empiric therapy may be helpful. A high degree of suspicion for cough due to B pertussis infection will lead to earlier diagnosis, patient isolation, and antibiotic treatment.

Chronic cough due to gastroesophageal reflux (CHEST guideline) — first-line management when reflux-cough syndrome is suspected: In adult patients with chronic cough suspected to be due to reflux-cough syndrome, we recommend that treatment include (1) diet modification to promote weight loss in overweight or obese patients; (2) head of bed elevation and avoiding meals within 3 hours of bedtime; and (3) in patients who report heartburn and regurgitation, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), H2-receptor antagonists, alginate, or antacid therapy sufficient to control these symptoms (Grade 1C). While it is expected that GI symptoms will respond within 4–8 weeks, the literature suggests that improvement in cough may take up to 3 months, and head of bed elevation is suggested based on its utility for improving GI GERD symptoms while acknowledging that it has not been demonstrated to be beneficial for cough.

Extrapolation limitations and risk of bias assessment of randomized controlled trials described in Table 3 — this table documents validity and generalizability concerns including "Carryover effect of active drug secondary to crossover design", "No intent-to-treat analysis", inadequate evaluation such as "Cough workup was not adequate to exclude nonreflux conditions" or selection effects "strongly biased to select reflux patients", and applicability statements like "Not generalizable to a chronic cough population" and "Results are not generalizable to patients without abnormal pH-metry results". Additional limitations include omission of co-interventions and behavior factors, exemplified by "No mention of diet, lifestyle modifications, or concomitant use of prokinetic agents". A trial notes exclusion criteria that create a "Strong bias against reflux etiology by excluding patients with heartburn > 2× per month", with risk-of-bias judged as "High risk of bias for patients with frequent heartburn; low risk of bias for those with infrequent heartburn. Overall risk of bias is uncertain", whereas other entries state "Risk of bias assessment: Not undertaken as did not fulfill criteria".

### The role of proton pump inhibitors in the management of gastroesophageal reflux disease-related asthma and chronic cough [^113tpA8w]. The American Journal of Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) occurs in at least one third of patients with asthma and is recognized as a potential trigger for asthma symptoms. The results of studies conducted in patients with both asthma and GERD, in which proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy is used to evaluate its effect on asthma outcome, are inconsistent, and many of these studies suffer from different design flaws. However, it does appear that PPI treatment may improve nocturnal asthma symptoms in patients who also have GERD. Moreover, both daytime asthmatic symptoms and pulmonary function seem to improve in some patients with PPI treatment. There is evidence that more severe GERD might predict a more favorable asthma outcome with PPI therapy. For effective management of GERD-related asthma, PPIs should be used at a dose double that of the standard dose for a minimum of 2 to 3 months. Although GERD is also known to be an important cause of chronic cough, there have been only 2 placebo-controlled trials investigating the efficacy of PPI on GERD-related chronic cough. Results of both of these trials suggest that PPI treatment relieves GERD-related chronic cough. As with GERD-related asthma, it would seem reasonable to use a double-standard dose of a PPI for a minimum of 2 to 3 months in the management of GERD-related chronic cough. However, larger, adequately planned studies are needed to confirm the role of PPIs in the management of GERD-related asthma and chronic cough.

Background

Whether gastroesophageal reflux (GER) or GER disease (GERD) causes chronic cough in children is controversial. Using the Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome (PICO) format, we undertook four systematic reviews. For children with chronic cough (> 4-weeks duration) and without underlying lung disease: (1) who do not have gastrointestinal GER symptoms, should empirical treatment for GERD be used? (2) with gastrointestinal GER symptoms, does treatment for GERD resolve the cough? (3) with or without gastrointestinal GER symptoms, what GER-based therapies should be used and for how long? (4) if GERD is suspected as the cause, what investigations and diagnostic criteria best determine GERD as the cause of the cough?

Methods

We used the CHEST Expert Cough Panel's protocol and American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST) methodological guidelines and GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) framework. Delphi methodology was used to obtain consensus.

Results

Few randomized controlled trials addressed the first two questions and none addressed the other two. The single meta-analysis (two randomized controlled trials) showed no significant difference between the groups (any intervention for GERD vs placebo for cough resolution; OR, 1.14; 95% CI, 0.45–2.93; P = 0.78). Proton pump inhibitors (vs placebo) caused increased serious adverse events. Qualitative data from existing CHEST cough systematic reviews were consistent with two international GERD guidelines.

Conclusions

The panelists endorsed that: (1) treatment(s) for GERD should not be used when there are no clinical features of GERD; and (2) pediatric GERD guidelines should be used to guide treatment and investigations.

### GERD treatment for chronic nonspecific cough in children… [^112bwLHr]. AAFP (2011). Low credibility.

Cochrane Abstract Background: Gastroesophageal reflux disease is said to be the causative factor in up to 41 percent of adults with chronic cough. Treatment for GERD includes conservative measures, pharmaceutical therapy, and fundoplication. They only found significant differences in sensitivity analyses. The authors found a significant improvement in change of cough scores at the end of intervention in those receiving PPI using generic inverse variance analysis on crossover trials. Two studies reported improvement in cough after five days to two weeks of treatment. Authors' Conclusions: PPI is not effective for cough associated with GERD symptoms in very young children and should not be used for cough outcomes.

There are insufficient data in older children to draw any valid conclusions. In adults, there is insufficient evidence to conclude definitely that GERD treatment with PPI is universally beneficial for cough associated with GERD. 4 The mean age range was 46 to 58 years. In all but one study, reflux was confirmed objectively, most often with pH probe. Nine studies compared PPI use with placebo, although the medications and dosages varied. Omeprazole was used most often, and higher PPI dosages were used in seven studies. Measures of treatment effects included complete cure, improvement of cough during treatment, and improvement of cough by the end of the trial. The differences in cure rates between the interventions and placebo were not statistically significant. Risks of GERD treatment in adults are small but include community-acquired pneumonia and hip fracture.

6, 7 Physicians should allow patients to make informed decisions and explain that PPIs are unlikely to benefit most patients with chronic non-specific cough. If a trial of therapy is offered, a PPI such as omeprazole is the most reasonable option, and patients should be given the opportunity to discontinue therapy after eight weeks. These recommendations are similar to those from the ACCP, which suggest an empiric trial of a PPI only in patients whose history and physical examination suggest GERD as a cause of chronic nonspecific cough. 1.

Summary of evidence and interpretation (KQ2–4) — For KQ2, the authors report that they identified two papers not referenced in prior systematic reviews, with one being an RCT and the second a systematic review; they excluded a Cochrane review on pharmacological treatment for GERD because it did not examine cough as a separate outcome. Only one small RCT is specifically discussed, and quantitative analyses considered data from two studies (one using PPI and the other using thickened feed), but as there was statistical heterogeneity (I2 ≥ 50%), they did not combine the data; the primary author of the RCT was contacted but was unable to provide additional data.

### Chronic cough due to gastroesophageal reflux in adults: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^114A4WQP]. Chest (2016). Medium credibility.

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and chronic cough in adults — symptom specificity is limited and associations vary across populations. No symptom, including heartburn, is 100% specific for GERD. In a population-based survey of 2,200 residents, frequent heartburn occurred in 18% and, among these, 14% also endorsed "bronchitis". Primary care data showed patients with a new diagnosis of GERD had higher odds of later cough (OR, 1.7; CI, 1.4–2.1) within the next 12 months. A cross-sectional survey of 4,003 residents found 12% reported chronic cough and regurgitation predicted cough (OR, 1.71; 99% CI, 1.20–2.45). Across specialty cough clinics, reflux contributed to 0% to 41% of cases. GERD may be "silent" from a GI perspective in up to 75% of cases, and during reflux monitoring approximately half of unselected chronic cough patients show a positive association between cough and acid or weakly acidic reflux events. Compounding the problem, the efficacy of PPI therapy for resolving GERD symptoms is substantially less than it is for healing esophagitis, and much less for atypical symptoms than it is for heartburn; moreover, a recent Cochrane review found insufficient evidence to conclude that PPI treatment is beneficial in treating nonspecific chronic cough.

### Therapeutic principles and unmet needs in the treatment of cough in pediatric patients: review and expert survey [^111GyBva]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Results

Definitions, diagnostic and therapeutic principles, and unmet needs in pediatric cough – literature review

In the literature review, key pediatric cough guidelines were identified from the American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST), an Australian multidisciplinary expert committee, the British Thoracic Society (BTS), and the European Respiratory Society (ERS). These guidelines are summarized below, supplemented by relevant information from clinical studies and reviews. Of note, the definition of pediatric patients varies among cough guidelines, from up to 12–18 years (and in some cases is undefined). All guidelines separated cough into acute and chronic, and most guidelines focused on chronic cough.

Acute pediatric cough

Definitions, causes, and diagnosis of acute cough

Acute pediatric cough is defined as a cough lasting for < 2–3 weeks, depending on the guideline. Certain guidelines also define subacute or prolonged acute cough to describe 'the gray area' between acute and chronic cough, when symptoms may be slowly resolving (for example, for patients with pertussis or post-viral cough).

Acute cough is most commonly caused by a viral upper respiratory tract infection (URTI). Other possibilities include an inhaled foreign body, seasonal allergic rhinitis, or the first presentation of a chronic disease. Acute pediatric cough caused by URTI can be diagnosed from patient history and physical examination, and generally does not require further investigation.

Treatment of acute cough

Cough caused by URTI normally resolves spontaneously, without treatment. Parents may require education and reassurance that cough will subside given time.

There is no good evidence for or against the effectiveness of over-the-counter (OTC) medicines in acute cough (including antitussives, expectorants, mucolytics, and antihistamines) and, consequently, these are not recommended by pediatric treatment guidelines. The safety of OTC medicines in children has been questioned; however, the overall adverse event rate appears to be low. Though generally not mentioned in pediatric cough guidelines, certain phytomedicines have shown efficacy on acute cough severity in pediatric patients, with few adverse events. There is some evidence that honey is more effective than placebo in relieving acute cough in children. However, honey is not recommended in very young children (< 1 year) due to a risk of botulism. Antibiotics are not effective or recommended for treating URTIs. Bronchodilators are not effective for acute cough in children without asthma (asthma treatment is described below).

Chronic pediatric cough

### Modern diagnosis of GERD: the Lyon consensus [^113vi6GJ]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Proton pump inhibitor trial

Although pragmatic, symptomatic response to PPI therapy does not equate to a GERD diagnosis, exhibiting an imperfect correspondence with objectively defined disease. On average, 69% of patients with oesophagitis, 49% of patients with non-erosive reflux disease (NERD) and 35% of patients with normal endoscopy and pH-metry gain symptom relief from a PPI trial. Hence, when evaluated as a diagnostic test for GERD among patients with heartburn, an empiric PPI trial has a sensitivity of 71% and specificity of only 44% compared with the combination of endoscopy and pH-metry. With atypical symptoms (chest pain, chronic cough, laryngitis, etc), PPI response rates are much lower than with heartburn, thereby diminishing the utility of that approach to diagnosis. A major limitation of the 'PPI test' is the strong modulation of symptoms by oesophageal hypersensitivity; there is also variation in PPI dosing and duration of the test. Nonetheless, despite low specificity and high placebo response, the empiric PPI treatment approach is less costly than diagnostic testingand is endorsed by societal guidelinesundoubtedly leading to the overdiagnosis of GERD and overuse of PPIs.

CHEST guideline — interstitial lung disease (ILD)-associated cough recommendations are as follows: For patients with ILD who present with a troublesome cough, we suggest that patients be assessed for progression of their underlying ILD, or complications from immunosuppressive treatment and also be considered for further investigation/treatment trials for their cough according to guidelines for acute, subacute and chronic cough (Ungraded Consensus-Based Statement). For patients with IPF, chronic cough and a negative workup for acid gastroesophageal reflux, we suggest that proton pump inhibitor therapy should not be prescribed (Ungraded Consensus-Based Statement). For patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis, we suggest that inhaled corticosteroids should not be routinely prescribed to treat the chronic cough (Grade 2C). For patients with ILD and refractory chronic cough, we suggest trials of therapies recommended for patients with unexplained chronic cough according to the CHEST guidelines, with treatments such as gabapentin and multimodality speech pathology therapy, or entering into clinical trials if available (Ungraded Consensus-Based Statement). For patients with chronic cough due to ILD, when alternative treatments have failed and the cough is adversely affecting their quality of life, we suggest that opiates be recommended for symptom control in a palliative care setting with reassessment of the benefits and risks at 1 week and then monthly before continuing (Ungraded Consensus-Based Statement).

CHEST Guideline and Expert Panel Report — adult cough classification by duration and associated etiologies and evidence are summarized as follows: With respect to acute cough (< 3 weeks), only three studies met our criteria for quality assessment, and all had a high risk of bias; as predicted by the 2006 CHEST Cough Guidelines, the most common causes were respiratory infections, most likely of viral cause, followed by exacerbations of underlying diseases such as asthma and COPD and pneumonia, and the subjects resided on three continents: North America, Europe, and Asia. With respect to subacute cough (duration, 3–8 weeks), only two studies met our criteria for quality assessment, and both had a high risk of bias; as predicted by the 2006 guidelines, the most common causes were postinfectious cough and exacerbation of underlying diseases such as asthma, COPD, and upper airway cough syndrome (UACS), and the subjects resided in countries in Asia. With respect to chronic cough (> 8 weeks), 11 studies met our criteria for quality assessment, and all had a high risk of bias; as predicted by the 2006 guidelines, the most common causes were UACS from rhinosinus conditions, asthma, gastroesophageal reflux disease, nonasthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis, combinations of these four conditions, and, less commonly, a variety of miscellaneous conditions and atopic cough in Asian countries, and the subjects resided on four continents: North America, South America, Europe, and Asia. Although the quality of evidence was low, the published literature since 2006 suggests that CHEST's 2006 Cough Guidelines and management algorithms for acute, subacute, and chronic cough in adults appeared useful in diagnosing and treating patients with cough around the globe, and these same algorithms have been updated to reflect the advances in cough management as of 2017.

### Cough: a worldwide problem [^112ux3cj]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

Cough is a common and important respiratory symptom that can produce significant complications for patients and be a diagnostic challenge for physicians. An organized approach to evaluating cough begins with classifying it as acute, subacute, or chronic in duration. Acute cough lasting less than 3 weeks may indicate an acute underlying cardiorespiratory disorder but is most commonly caused by a self-limited viral upper respiratory tract infection (eg, common cold). Subacute cough lasting 3 to 8 weeks commonly has a postinfectious origin; among the causes, Bordetella pertussis infection should be included in the differential diagnosis. Chronic cough lasts longer than 8 weeks. When a patient is a nonsmoker, is not taking an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, and has a normal or near-normal chest radiograph, chronic cough is most commonly caused by upper airway cough syndrome, asthma, nonasthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis, or gastroesophageal reflux disease alone or in combination.

### Treatment of interstitial lung disease associated cough: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^113JBNdc]. Chest (2018). Medium credibility.

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy in ILD-associated cough: GERD is highly prevalent in ILD (including IPF) and scleroderma-associated ILD and is therefore a potential cause of cough, but there were no RCTs of PPI therapy in ILD-associated cough. In IPF cough, a small open-label study of high dose acid suppression with validated objective and subjective cough end points showed no improvement in cough with PPI therapy, and in unexplained chronic cough without ILD, two RCTs did not demonstrate antitussive efficacy. The CHEST unexplained chronic cough guidelines therefore recommended that, in patients with a negative workup of acid gastro-esophageal reflux that included esophageal pH monitoring, PPI therapy should not be prescribed; a similar approach in IPF cough seems reasonable. In scleroderma-associated ILD, esophageal dysfunction is a key feature and improvement in cough has been associated with improvements in GERD; therefore, a thorough approach investigating both acid and nonacid reflux is reasonable until studies that guide best management become available.

- **Pathophysiology**: Common causes of cough include upper airway cough syndrome, GERD/laryngopharyngeal reflux disease, asthma, and nonasthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis.
- **Disease course**: Cough persistence may lead to vomiting, muscle pain, urinary incontinence, tiredness, syncope, and depression.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Chronic cough is not associated with an increase in mortality in the absence of a serious underlying disease.

### Cough and sputum in long COVID are associated with severe acute COVID-19: a Japanese cohort study [^1158xo2S]. Respiratory Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which has spread worldwide since its outbreak in China in December 2019. A large number of cases and deaths from COVID-19 have been reported, and the pandemic is ongoing, although vaccines are widely available. Most patients who have recovered from acute COVID-19 experience long-term effects on multiple organs and systems. In most cases, persistent symptoms resolve over several months. However, some patients experience systemic symptoms that persist for more than 3–24 months. The World Health Organization (WHO) developed a consensus definition of the post-COVID-19 condition in 2021. To date, these sequelae have been called post-acute COVID-19, long-haul COVID, post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), or post-acute syndrome of COVID-19. These systemic symptoms, including coughing and sputum, deteriorate the quality of life of patients and cause health and social burdens.

Cough is a protective response against the elimination of inhaled foreign substances and airway secretions. Patients with acute or chronic respiratory diseases often present with cough. Persistent cough for > 8 weeks is defined as chronic cough accompanied by chronic respiratory diseases, including asthma, COPD, gastro-esophageal reflux disease, and otorhinolaryngological disorders with posterior nasal leakage. Cough is classified as dry or productive, based on the presence or absence of sputum. Productive cough is primarily associated with pneumonia and/or bronchitis caused by infectious diseases. Sputum is occasionally the main symptom without cough, especially in chronic respiratory diseases such as bronchiectasis. Therapeutic strategies for cough and sputum are planned to treat underlying diseases using antitussive agents and expectorants. Cough during acute COVID-19 infection (acute COVID-19-associated cough) occurs in 40.5–72.5% of the patients. This symptom generally improves, and its incidence rate decreases to 18% at the 3-month follow-up. Conversely, 10% of post-infected patients still have a prolonged cough 2 years after acute infection (post COVID-19 cough), while only 4% of COVID-19 uninfected patients exhibit cough.

### Effectiveness of amitriptyline versus cough suppressants in the treatment of chronic cough resulting from postviral vagal neuropathy [^113AyvUS]. The Laryngoscope (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of this prospective, randomized, controlled study (N = 28) was to evaluate the effectiveness of amitriptyline versus cough suppressants in the treatment of chronic cough resulting from postviral vagal neuropathy.

Methods

Patients were selected based on a clinical history consistent with postviral vagal neuropathy and a history of an antecedent upper respiratory tract infection. All patients had been tried on antireflux medication (proton pump inhibitors) and had a negative chest x-ray before presentation. All were nonsmokers without a history of asthma. Patients on angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors were excluded from the study. All patients completed a pretreatment, validated cough-specific quality-of-life (QOL) survey. Patients were randomized by chart numbers to either 10 mg amitriptyline at bedtime or 10 to 100 mg/5 mL, 10 mL codeine/guaifenesin every 6 hours standing dose while awake. Both groups were instructed to complete 10 days of therapy and then asked to subjectively rate the reduction in the frequency and severity of their cough by 100%, 75%, 50%, 25%, or 0% as well as completing the posttreatment cough QOL questionnaire. Those patients experiencing a 75% to 100% reduction were recorded as having a complete response, 25% to 50% a partial response, and 0% as having no response. Final results and the cough QOL survey were recorded and used for statistical analysis.

Results

A majority of patients in the amitriptyline group achieved a complete response on the initial dose of 10 mg. None of the codeine/guaifenesin group achieved a complete response. The data were analyzed using a logistic regression model, and amitriptyline was found to be a highly significant predictor of a greater than 50% response when compared with codeine/guaifenesin (P = 0.0007). The same data were analyzed using a proportional odds model and similar results were noted.

Conclusions

Chronic cough can have a profound impact on the psychosocial function of patients. The most common causes of a persisting cough in the absence of infection or chronic smoking are laryngopharyngeal reflux, asthma, particularly the cough variant, allergy, rhinosinusitis, bronchitis, and medications, in particular angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Currently, there are few effective treatments for cough with an acceptable therapeutic ratio and more selective drugs with a more favorable side effect profile are needed. This is this first prospective, randomized, controlled study comparing the effectiveness of amitriptyline versus codeine/guaifenesin for select cases of chronic cough resulting from suspected postviral vagal neuropathy.

### Chronic cough and gastroesophageal reflux in children: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^111w9sPn]. Chest (2019). High credibility.

Guidelines and expert sources for children with chronic cough and GER/GERD converge that "No specific recommendation for children with cough and GERD but it is implied that GERD on its own should be treated". De Benedictis and Bush state that "Children with chronic cough and typical symptoms of GERD should undergo medical treatment — dietary, lifestyle modifications and acid suppression therapy" and "we suggest that a three-stage therapeutic trial should be completed before diagnosing reflux-related cough: (1) clear-cut response to a 4 to 8-week treatment with PPI; (2) relapse on stopping medication; (3) new response to recommencing medication, with weaning down therapy as appropriate to the child's symptoms". NASPGHAN and ESPGHAN add, "Based on expert opinion, the working group recommends evaluation of treatment efficacy and exclusion of alternative causes of symptoms in infants and children not responding to 4 to 8 weeks of optimal medical therapy for GERD". – Strong recommendation. NICE advises for GERD treatment to "Assess the response to a 4 week trial of the PPIs or H2 receptor antagonist and consider referral to a specialist for possible endoscopy if the symptoms do not resolve or recur after stopping the treatment".

### Effective and safe proton pump inhibitor therapy in acid-related diseases – A position paper addressing benefits and potential harms of acid suppression [^113RAm1u]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Despite the negative conclusions of a Cochrane meta-analysis, a recent review suggests that a therapeutic benefit for acid-suppressive therapy in patients with chronic cough cannot be dismissed, advocating a rigorous patient selection that could allow the identification of patient subgroups likely to be responsive. On the contrary, no systematic reviews and meta-analyses found any significant clinical benefit of PPI therapy over placebo in reflux laryngitis.

Asthma and GERD can often coexist, with reflux disease being reported in 40–80% of patients with asthma. While asthma medications can trigger GERD, PPIs might, on the contrary, improve asthma control. Here, again, an early Cochrane review showed no benefit of PPI therapy on nocturnal symptom score and lung function, but a recent meta-analysis – by selecting the morning peak expiratory flow rate as the primary outcome – disclosed a benefit of PPIs over placebo, which was greater in patients with proven GERD.

Despite the widespread use of PPIs in dental practice to manage the oral manifestations of GERD, treatment of dental erosions represents the only objectively documented clinical use.

In summary, while PPIs are the mainstay of medical treatment for esophageal manifestations of GERD, their benefit in extra-digestive GERD remains uncertain. The complexity of patient presentation is matched by the challenge in appropriate diagnosis of reflux as the cause for patients' symptoms, which may also be related to other co-morbidities. Upper GI endoscopy and pH monitoring suffer from poor sensitivity, while laryngoscopy suffers from poor specificity in diagnosing reflux in this group of patients. An empiric trial of PPIs could be the initial approach to diagnose and treat the potential underlying cause of these extra-esophageal symptoms. For those who improve with PPIs, GERD is presumed to be the etiology, but for those who do not respond, diagnostic testing with impedance and/or pH monitoring are reasonable to exclude continued acid or weakly acid reflux. In such cases, etiologies other than GERD may be pursued. Difficult patients are best investigated and treated in referral centers.

CHEST guideline — chronic cough and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) in children: In children with chronic cough (> 4-weeks duration) and without underlying lung disease, a meta-analysis of two randomized controlled trials found no significant difference in cough resolution between any intervention for GERD and placebo (OR, 1.14; 95% CI, 0.45–2.93; P = 0.78), and proton pump inhibitors (vs placebo) caused increased serious adverse events. The panelists endorsed that treatment(s) for GERD should not be used when there are no clinical features of GERD and that pediatric GERD guidelines should be used to guide treatment and investigations; qualitative data from existing CHEST cough systematic reviews were consistent with two international GERD guidelines.

### Gastro-oesophageal reflux treatment for prolonged non-specific cough in children and adults [^116wzhRC]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GORD) is said to be the causative factor in up to 41% of adults with chronic cough. Treatment for GORD includes conservative measures (diet manipulation), pharmaceutical therapy (motility or prokinetic agents, H(2)-antagonist and proton pump inhibitors (PPI)) and fundoplication.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy of GORD treatment on chronic cough in children and adults with GORD and prolonged cough that is not related to an underlying respiratory disease, i.e. non-specific chronic cough.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, review articles and reference lists of relevant articles. The date of last search was 8 April 2010.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on GORD treatment for cough in children and adults without primary lung disease.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We contacted study authors for further information.

Main Results

We included 19 studies (six paediatric, 13 adults). None of the paediatric studies could be combined for meta-analysis. A single RCT in infants found that PPI (compared to placebo) was not efficacious for cough outcomes (favouring placebo OR 1.61; 95% CI 0.57 to 4.55) but those on PPI had significantly increased adverse events (OR 5.56; 95% CI 1.18 to 26.25) (number needed to treat for harm in four weeks was 11 (95% CI 3 to 232)). In adults, analysis of H(2) antagonist, motility agents and conservative treatment for GORD was not possible (lack of data) and there were no controlled studies of fundoplication. We analysed nine adult studies comparing PPI (two to three months) to placebo for various outcomes in the meta-analysis. Using intention-to-treat, pooled data from studies resulted in no significant difference between treatment and placebo in total resolution of cough (OR 0.46; 95% CI 0.19 to 1.15). Pooled data revealed no overall significant improvement in cough outcomes (end of trial or change in cough scores). We only found significant differences in sensitivity analyses. We found a significant improvement in change of cough scores at end of intervention (two to three months) in those receiving PPI (standardised mean difference -0.41; 95% CI -0.75 to -0.07) using generic inverse variance analysis on cross-over trials. Two studies reported improvement in cough after five days to two weeks of treatment.

Authors' Conclusions

PPI is not efficacious for cough associated with GORD symptoms in very young children (including infants) and should not be used for cough outcomes. There is insufficient data in older children to draw any valid conclusions. In adults, there is insufficient evidence to conclude definitely that GORD treatment with PPI is universally beneficial for cough associated with GORD. Clinicians should be cognisant of the period (natural resolution with time) and placebo effect in studies that utilise cough as an outcome measure. Future paediatric and adult studies should be double-blind, randomised controlled and parallel-design, using treatments for at least two months, with validated subjective and objective cough outcomes and include ascertainment of time to respond as well as assessment of acid and/or non-acid reflux.

### An observational study to understand burden and cost of care in adults diagnosed with refractory chronic cough (RCC) or unexplained chronic cough (UCC) [^115nmMJa]. Respiratory Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Frequent coughing over a prolonged period without resolution can have significant physical, social and psychological consequences, including sleep disturbance, urinary stress incontinence, anxiety, depression, and interference with work/socializing. Social isolation may also be a factor, particularly since the onset of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic.

In clinical practice it is important to distinguish between cough that is truly refractory or unexplained, and cough that can be explained and treated effectively. Refractory chronic cough (RCC) is a cough that persists despite investigations and guideline-based treatment of common underlying causes such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), airway hyper-responsiveness, eosinophilic bronchitis, rhinitis, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor treatment, gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD), and obstructive sleep apnoea. In other patients, clinical assessment may fail to identify a cause after diagnosis and treatment by evidence-based guidelines, and patients are classified with unexplained chronic cough (UCC). Limited prevalence data suggest that RCC might account for a third of chronic cough patients and UCC for about 10%.

RCC and UCC can have a major economic impact on healthcare systems and society. However, data on the burden of RCC and UCC in terms of healthcare resource utilisation is lacking. The demonstration of both medical and economic value is important for clinicians, healthcare providers, payers, and patients as new therapeutic agents for these conditions approach late-stage clinical trials. This observational study was conducted to assess the burden of RCC and UCC to the healthcare system by analysing resource utilisation and treatment patterns associated with these conditions in the 5 years prior to and 2 years post first attendance at a specialist clinic.

### Comprehensive evidence-based review on European antitussives [^116ZAiCJ]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2016). Medium credibility.

Acute cough caused by viral respiratory tract infections is probably the most common illness to afflict mankind. Despite the widespread but ineffective prescribing of antibiotics, there is no specific therapy. Home remedies and over-the-counter medicines are the mainstay for treatment of this short-lived but debilitating condition where cough is a major troublesome symptom. Across Europe, there are large variations in the recommendations made by healthcare professionals for the treatment of acute cough. This has arisen through custom and practice based on the evidence of historical studies performed to standards well short of what would be considered legitimate today. Acute cough is particularly difficult to study in a controlled setting because of the high rate of spontaneous remission and a large placebo effect. Here we detail the validated modern methodology used to assess the efficacy of antitussives and review the drugs commonly used in Europe against these standards.

### Acute and chronic cough [^116VjLoM]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Cough is a normal protective mechanism which occurs many times every day. Cough with a viral infection lasts up to 2 weeks in 70–80% of children. Cough present for more than 4 weeks may be due to a recognized specific cause or non specific and considered protracted bronchitis. Chronic cough in children is different to that in adults and rarely due to GE reflux, postnasal drip or asthma. Treatment addresses the specific cause and symptomatic treatment is rarely needed or effective.

### How does rhinovirus cause the common cold cough? [^111Qx1fp]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2016). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cough is a common symptom associated with upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs). In some patients, coughing can persist leading to a syndrome known as postviral or postinfectious cough which is arbitrarily defined as lasting from 3 to 8 weeks, with normal chest radiograph findings. In some individuals, cough persists even longer, when it is termed a chronic cough. While a normal cough is a vital protective reflex preventing aspiration, cough hypersensitivity is the mechanism thought to underlie almost all types of pathological cough. This has been demonstrated in URTI.

Cough causes a plethora of complications affecting the cardiovascular, gastrointestinal and respiratory systems, with far-reaching psychological, neurological and musculoskeletal effects. While there are many agents on the market to reduce the frequency of cough and aid in the clearance of mucus, a systematic review of over-the-counter preparations failed to recommend any available treatment. For example, the use of codeine in respiratory tract infection-associated cough was found to be no more effective than its vehicle, and prescription-only medications are often unsuitable for certain groups of individuals.

There are three metrics which are used to study cough: cough challenge, cough counting, and subjective end points such as visual analogue scale or quality of life. Cough challenge studies include the use of pro-tussive agents, such as capsaicin and citric acid, which stimulate transient receptor potential (TRP) ion channels to induce cough.TRP channels have been popularised as pro-tussive irritant receptors. However, on account of repeated clinical trial failures in patients with chronic cough using both cough counting and subjective measures, TRPV1 and A1 antagonists as anti-tussives have failed to reach the clinic, and an unpublished RCT of inhaled TRPA1 antagonist GRC 17536 (personal communication AHM, 2015). A recent shift of focus now proposes that other channels and receptors, such as P2X receptors, different TRP channels including TRPV4 and TRPM8may be responsible for the observed hypersensitivity. It seems unlikely that one single channel, or receptor, is responsible for causing cough hypersensitivity in all participants in cases of postviral and chronic cough.

### Evidence for sensory neuropathy and pharmacologic management [^1156VdCA]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

Recent literature points to postviral sensory neuropathy as a possible cause for refractory chronic cough. Vagal neuropathy may affect the sensory branches, inducing chronic cough or laryngospasm. Although the clinical presentation is fairly well described, there is little in the way of diagnostic criteria to establish this diagnosis. This article highlights the clinical picture of this disease and the efficacy, side-effect profiles of the currently used pharmacological interventions.

### Managing chronic cough as a symptom in children and management algorithms: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^114jsK6t]. Chest (2020). High credibility.

Post-infectious and other infections causing chronic cough in children: Post-viral cough refers to cough after the acute upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs), and in the community cough post viral URTIs is likely the most common cause of chronic cough in children. The mean annual incidence of total respiratory illness per person per year ranges from 5.0 to 7.95 in children aged < 4 years to 2.4 to 5.02 in children aged 10 to 14 years. Following URTIs, acute cough typically resolves within 1 to 3 weeks but 10% may cough for ≥ 20 to 25 days. In the follow-up of 839 children, 627 (75%) coughed for < 7 days and 171 (20%) for > 28 days, and of those with chronic cough (> 28 days), a new and serious illness was found in the 36 of the 117 children who were clinically reviewed. Other infections such as pertussis and mycoplasma can cause chronic cough, and pertussis should be suspected, especially with known contact even if the child is fully immunized.

### ACG clinical guideline for the diagnosis and management of gastroesophageal reflux disease [^116Noc48]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Extraesophageal GERD symptoms — diagnostic and treatment recommendations emphasize conservative attribution and objective testing. "We recommend evaluation for non-GERD causes in patients with possible extraesophageal manifestations before ascribing symptoms to GERD". "We recommend that patients who have extraesophageal manifestations of GERD without typical GERD symptoms (e.g., heartburn and regurgitation) undergo reflux testing for evaluation before PPI therapy". For those with both typical and extraesophageal symptoms, "we suggest considering a trial of twice-daily PPI therapy for 8–12 weeks before additional testing". Endoscopy is discouraged as a standalone diagnostic for extraesophageal syndromes: "We suggest that upper endoscopy should not be used as the method to establish a diagnosis of GERD-related asthma, chronic cough, or laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR)". Procedural interventions require proof of reflux: "In patients treated for extraesophageal reflux disease, surgical or endoscopic antireflux procedures are only recommended in patients with objective evidence of reflux".

### Managing chronic cough due to asthma and NAEB in adults and adolescents: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^117CvTe3]. Chest (2020). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for chronic cough, more specifically with respect to patients with asthma, ACCP 2020 guidelines recommend to consider stepping-up the dose of ICSs and administering a therapeutic trial of a leukotriene inhibitor after reconsideration of alternative causes of cough in adult and adolescent patients, if response is incomplete in patients with cough variant asthma or if cough is the remaining isolated symptom in patients with cough as one of the symptoms of asthma.
