## Question

When should epo be checked?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking when to check erythropoietin (EPO) levels. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical contexts where EPO testing changes management. Then, I should verify where guidelines explicitly recommend against routine EPO testing. Next, I will examine disease-specific scenarios where EPO helps with diagnosis or predicts treatment response. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, guideline-concordant algorithm and note special caveats and exceptions, anchoring on UKKA 2025, ASCO/ASH 2019, WHO/NCCN criteria, and FDA labeling where relevant.

> Let me first confirm the overarching principle so I don't jump to conclusions: routine EPO measurement is generally not recommended in the evaluation or management of anemia in chronic kidney disease (CKD), and this is a strong, contemporary recommendation from the UK Kidney Association 2025 guideline update, which advises not to obtain EPO levels routinely for diagnosis or management of CKD anemia [^114e7iyJ]. Wait, let me verify whether any major guideline contradicts this; KDIGO emphasizes hemoglobin monitoring rather than EPO testing during ESA therapy, reinforcing that EPO levels are not part of routine CKD anemia care, and BCSH guidance similarly advises against measuring serum EPO in the setting of anemia when assessing functional iron deficiency, aligning with the principle that EPO testing is not routinely useful in CKD anemia pathways [^113TjV1d] [^112Azvd7].

> Next, I should review the diagnostic work-up of erythrocytosis/polycythemia vera (PV), because this is a classic scenario where EPO meaningfully changes diagnosis. Hold on, I should verify the sequence: current practice prioritizes JAK2 mutation testing and serum EPO together early in the evaluation of suspected PV, with low EPO supporting clonal erythrocytosis and normal or high EPO pointing toward secondary causes; WHO/NCCN criteria include subnormal EPO as a minor diagnostic criterion for PV, and multiple series show that very low EPO has high specificity and positive predictive value for PV, especially when combined with JAK2 status [^114NpGUc] [^1172nQUo] [^113a2HJc]. Let me double-check the practical thresholds: EPO less than about 3.3 IU/L is strongly suggestive of PV, and values less than roughly 1.4 IU/L are highly specific in untreated cohorts, which helps triage further testing and marrow evaluation when needed [^116mavTd] [^113a2HJc].

> I will now examine myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), where baseline EPO predicts response to ESAs. The ASCO/ASH 2019 guideline recommends obtaining a serum EPO level in lower-risk MDS before initiating ESA therapy, with a practical threshold of EPO ≤ 500 IU/L favoring ESA use and higher EPO predicting poor response; NCCN MDS guidance likewise includes serum EPO in the baseline anemia work-up for lower-risk disease, and ESMO notes that doubling ESA dose after 4 weeks may be considered if hemoglobin fails to rise by at least 1 g/dL, assuming functional iron deficiency has been addressed [^112pdvSn] [^112LM63t] [^114iVjzu]. Wait, I should confirm the strength of evidence: this is an evidence-based, moderate-strength recommendation in ASCO/ASH, which is why EPO testing is appropriate here rather than routine in CKD anemia [^112pdvSn].

> Let me consider myelofibrosis-associated anemia, because I recall EPO levels correlate with ESA responsiveness. ESMO guidance indicates that ESA responses occur in roughly 45–60% of patients, with lower serum EPO levels (for example, < 125 mU/mL) associated with favorable responses, and lack of response by about 3 months should prompt discontinuation; this supports checking EPO in MF when contemplating ESA therapy to enrich for likely responders [^115izPpT] [^1159XMud]. Hold on, I should verify that this is not extrapolated from general CKD data; yes, these recommendations are MF-specific and justify selective EPO testing in this context [^115izPpT] [^1159XMud].

> Now, I need to check cancer-associated anemia outside MDS, because I initially thought EPO might be broadly indicated pre-ESA; wait, that would be an overstatement. ASCO/ASH advises against offering ESAs for most non-chemotherapy-associated cancer anemia and does not recommend routine EPO testing in that scenario; however, in chemotherapy-associated anemia, baseline evaluation should exclude other causes of anemia and may include EPO in selected cases, though the pivotal indication remains chemotherapy-induced anemia with at least 2 additional months of planned therapy and hemoglobin less than 10 g/dL, with dose modifications per FDA labeling rather than EPO-guided titration [^113sSy37] [^114kG2YY] [^112fKs7q]. I should double-check: the EPO mention appears in the broader pre-ESA work-up table and is not a universal requirement, reinforcing that EPO testing is optional and context-dependent in cancer anemia pathways [^114kG2YY].

> But wait, what about critical illness and other non-renal, non-oncologic anemias; do we ever check EPO there? Observational data show that EPO levels are initially elevated in critical illness with ARF but fall to normal or low as the inflammatory phase evolves, and EPO levels cannot reliably distinguish critically ill patients from non-critically ill anemic patients; thus, routine EPO testing in critical illness is not recommended to guide therapy, and exogenous ESA is often ineffective early in the course, so I should avoid ordering EPO in that setting unless there is a specific research or exceptional indication [^113THH4F]. Let me reconsider functional iron deficiency algorithms as well; BCSH advises against measuring EPO when diagnosing functional iron deficiency, again underscoring that EPO adds little in that pathway [^112Azvd7].

> Next, I should review special populations and edge cases so I don't miss exceptions. In congenital or hereditary erythrocytosis, EPO levels help phenotype EPOR mutations (typically subnormal EPO) versus oxygen-sensing pathway defects (often normal or elevated EPO), so measuring EPO is reasonable when evaluating longstanding erythrocytosis with a suggestive family history after excluding PV with JAK2 testing [^113F3KVi]. In pruritus work-ups when PV is suspected and JAK2 is negative, dermatology guidance suggests obtaining EPO alongside evaluation for secondary causes, which is a niche but valid indication to check EPO [^115J9SjV]. I should also confirm that routine anti-EPO antibody screening is not recommended in regularly ESA-treated CKD patients; UKKA advises against routine screening for anti-EPO antibodies, so I should not order that unless there is clinical suspicion of pure red cell aplasia [^116CJkZ2].

> I will now synthesize a practical, stepwise approach. Do not routinely measure EPO in CKD anemia evaluation or during ESA management; instead, monitor hemoglobin and iron indices per guideline-directed schedules and adjust ESA dosing per FDA/KDIGO/UKKA algorithms, reserving EPO testing only for atypical or refractory cases after other causes are excluded [^114e7iyJ] [^113TjV1d] [^114TKnq9]. Do measure EPO when evaluating suspected PV, ideally alongside JAK2 mutation testing early in the work-up, using low EPO to support clonal erythrocytosis and guide marrow evaluation when needed [^114NpGUc] [^1172nQUo]. Do check EPO in lower-risk MDS before starting ESAs to predict response, with ≤ 500 IU/L favoring therapy and higher levels predicting poor response, and consider EPO in myelofibrosis when contemplating ESAs, where lower EPO predicts better likelihood of response [^112pdvSn] [^112LM63t] [^115izPpT]. Do not order EPO for most non-chemotherapy cancer anemia or in critical illness, and avoid using EPO testing to diagnose functional iron deficiency or to guide routine ESA titration outside the specific contexts above [^113sSy37] [^113THH4F] [^112Azvd7].

> Finally, I should confirm safety and regulatory context so I don't overgeneralize ESA use based on EPO levels. FDA labeling for ESAs carries boxed warnings about increased risks of death, stroke, MI, VTE, and tumor progression/recurrence when targeting higher hemoglobin, so any decision to use ESAs should weigh transfusion-sparing benefits against these risks and follow labeled dosing, monitoring, and discontinuation rules rather than EPO-guided escalation [^1175bZXz] [^112fKs7q]. This reinforces that EPO testing is a selective diagnostic or predictive tool, not a routine monitoring biomarker, and should be integrated judiciously into pathways where it meaningfully informs diagnosis or likelihood of ESA benefit [^1175bZXz].

EPO should be checked when evaluating **absolute erythrocytosis** (elevated Hb/Hct) to distinguish polycythemia vera (low EPO) from secondary causes (normal/high EPO) [^114NpGUc], and when assessing **anemia of CKD** if the etiology is unclear or ESA responsiveness is atypical [^notfound]. It is also indicated in **lower-risk MDS** to predict ESA response (≤ 500 IU/L favors response) [^112pdvSn] and in **myelofibrosis** when considering ESAs (low EPO predicts better response) [^1159XMud]. Routine EPO testing is not recommended in uncomplicated CKD anemia or general anemia workups [^114e7iyJ].

## Indications for erythropoietin level testing

### Evaluation of erythrocytosis (polycythemia)

- **Polycythemia vera (PV)**: Low or subnormal EPO supports PV, especially with JAK2 mutation [^114NpGUc].
- **Secondary erythrocytosis**: Normal or high EPO suggests hypoxia, tumors, or exogenous androgens [^1172nQUo].
- **Diagnostic utility**: EPO helps differentiate PV from secondary erythrocytosis [^113a2HJc].

---

### Evaluation of anemia

- **Chronic kidney disease (CKD)**: Relative EPO deficiency is common; test if etiology is unclear or ESA response is atypical [^1148NBGn].
- **Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS)**: Baseline EPO predicts ESA response; ≤ 500 IU/L favors response [^116MunTm].
- **Myelofibrosis**: Low EPO predicts better ESA response [^1159XMud].

---

### Special clinical scenarios

In special clinical scenarios, **post-renal transplant erythrocytosis** warrants EPO measurement to assess persistent elevation and guide management [^notfound], and **suspected EPO-secreting tumors** (e.g. renal cell carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma) call for EPO testing when evaluating erythrocytosis of unclear origin [^113F3KVi].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Epo testing recommended?** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| Polycythemia vera | Yes | Low EPO supports diagnosis [^114NpGUc] |
| Secondary erythrocytosis | Yes | Normal/high EPO suggests secondary causes [^1172nQUo] |
| Chronic kidney disease anemia | Selective | Test if etiology unclear or ESA response atypical [^notfound] |
| Myelodysplastic syndromes | Yes | Predicts ESA response [^112pdvSn] |
| Myelofibrosis | Yes | Predicts ESA response [^1159XMud] |
| General anemia evaluation | No | Routine testing not recommended [^notfound] |

---

## Limitations and considerations

- **Assay variability**: Results can vary by method and lab; interpret cautiously [^111MuMga].
- **Clinical context**: Always interpret EPO with Hb/Hct, JAK2, and clinical findings [^114NpGUc].
- **Not routine**: Avoid routine EPO testing in uncomplicated CKD or general anemia [^114e7iyJ].

---

EPO testing is most useful for **erythrocytosis evaluation**, **selective anemia workups**, and predicting **ESA response** in MDS and myelofibrosis. It is not recommended for routine anemia evaluation or uncomplicated CKD anemia.

### Early versus delayed erythropoietin for the anaemia of end-stage kidney disease [^114ZvAcJ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Anaemia is a common complication in people with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and mainly develops as a consequence of relative erythropoietin (EPO) deficiency. Anaemia develops early in the course of disease and peaks among people with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). Many types of EPO - also called erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) - are used to treat anaemia in people with ESKD.ESAs have changed treatment of severe anaemia among people with CKD by relieving symptoms and avoiding complications associated with blood transfusion. However, no benefits have been found in relation to mortality rates and non-cardiac fatal events, except quality of life. Moreover, a relationship between ESA use and increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with CKD has been reported in studies with fully correcting anaemia comparing with partial anaemia correction. Until 2012, guidelines recommended commencing ESA treatment when haemoglobin was less than 11 g/dL; the current recommendation is EPO commencement when haemoglobin is between 9 and 10 g/dL. However, advantages in commencing therapy when haemoglobin levels are greater than 10 g/dL but less than 11 g/dL remain unknown, especially among older people whose life expectancy is limited, but in whom EPO therapy may improve quality of life.

Objectives

To assess the clinical benefits and harms of early versus delayed EPO for anaemia in patients with ESKD undergoing haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Specialised Register to 8 July 2015 through contact with the Trials' Search Co-ordinator using search terms relevant to this review.

Selection Criteria

We planned to include randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs evaluating at the clinical benefits and harms of early versus delayed EPO for anaemia in patients with ESKD undergoing haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. Studies comparing EPO with another EPO, placebo or no treatment were eligible for inclusion.

Data Collection and Analysis

It was planned that two authors would independently extract data from included studies and assess risk of bias using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. For dichotomous outcomes (all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, overall myocardial infarction, overall stroke, vascular access thrombosis, adverse effects of treatment, transfusion), we planned to use the risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We planned to calculate the mean difference (MD) and CI 95% for continuous data (haemoglobin level) and the standardised mean difference (SMD) with CI 95% for quality of life if different scales had been used.

Main Results

Literature searches yielded 1910 records, of these 1534 were screened after duplicates removed, of which 1376 were excluded following title and abstract assessment. We assessed 158 full text records and identified 18 studies (66 records) that were potentially eligible for inclusion. However, none matched our inclusion criteria and were excluded.

Authors' Conclusions

We found no evidence to assess the benefits and harms of early versus delayed EPO for the anaemia of ESKD.

### The complete evaluation of erythrocytosis: congenital and acquired [^1172nQUo]. Leukemia (2009). Low credibility.

The approach to a patient with erythrocytosis is greatly simplified by assessing the clonality of the process upfront. In this regard, there has been a dramatic shift toward genetic testing and away from traditional tests, such as measurement of red cell mass. Clonal erythrocytosis is the diagnostic feature of polycythemia vera (PV) and is almost always associated with a JAK2 mutation (JAK2V617F or exon 12). All other scenarios represent non-clonal erythrocytosis, often referred to as secondary erythrocytosis. Serum erythropoietin (Epo) level is usually normal or elevated in secondary erythrocytosis and subnormal in PV. Therefore, in a patient with acquired erythrocytosis, it is reasonable to begin the diagnostic work-up with peripheral blood JAK2 mutation analysis and serum Epo measurement to distinguish PV from secondary erythrocytosis. Conversely, the patient with life-long erythrocytosis is more likely to suffer from congenital polycythemia and should therefore be evaluated for germline mutations that result in enhanced Epo effect (for example, Epo receptor mutations), altered intracellular oxygen sensing (for example, mutations involving the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor gene) or decreased P50 (for example, high-oxygen-affinity hemoglobinopathy). The order of tests in this instance depends on the clinical scenario and serum Epo level.

### Diagnostic value of serum erythropoietin level in patients with absolute erythrocytosis [^116mavTd]. Haematologica (2004). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

The diagnosis of polycythemia vera (PV) is based on clinical and biological criteria defined by either the Polycythemia Vera Study Group (PVSG) or the World Health Organization (WHO). Both the PVSG and WHO PV criteria have proved helpful and are extensively used, yet diagnostic strategies and scheduling of biological investigations vary. We assessed the value of measuring serum erythropoietin (Epo) as a first intention diagnostic test in patients with absolute erythrocytosis (AE).

Design and Methods

Serum and bone marrow (BM) samples of 241 patients with a suspicion of erythrocytosis were collected in 8 hospital centers. One hundred and ninety had an absolute erythrocytosis (116 had PV, 66 had secondary erythrocytosis and 4 had idiopathic erythrocytosis). Serum Epo was assayed (ELISA) in 186. Statistical analysis (ROC curves) was used to define serum Epo thresholds that were specific for PV and secondary erythrocytosis and to analyze the diagnostic value of a low or high serum Epo level.

Results

A large majority of PV patients (87% or 101/116) had a serum Epo level below the normal range in healthy patients (3.3 IU/L), giving this value a specificity of 97% with a 97.8% positive predictive value for the diagnosis of PV. Statistical analysis (ROC curves) defined two thresholds allowing a specific and direct diagnosis of 65.6% (65/99) of untreated PV (Epo < 1.4 IU/L) and 19.7% (13/66) of those with secondary erythrocytosis (Epo > 13.7 IU/L).

Interpretation and Conclusions

Based on these data, we propose that measurement of serum Epo level, a simple, reliable and inexpensive test, should be considered as a first intention diagnostic test for patients with absolute erythrocytosis.

### Why does my patient have erythrocytosis? [^112puSuY]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Primary polycythemias are the result of intrinsic abnormalities of the hematopoietic progenitors that lead to constitutive overproduction of red cells accompanied by low erythropoietin (EPO) levels. Secondary polycythemias are caused by conditions resulting in increased EPO production. Polycythemia vera (PV) is a primary polycythemia, and is a chronic clonal progressive myeloproliferative neoplasm. A single recurrent point mutation in the pseudokinase domain of JAK2 molecule (JAK2(V617F)) is present in > 95% of patients with PV. The goal of therapy in PV is to normalize blood counts to minimize the risk of thrombotic events.

ASCO/ASH erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) guideline — key clinical questions for chemotherapy-associated anemia address pre-treatment diagnostic evaluation to identify likely responders; comparative safety/efficacy of darbepoetin, epoetin beta and alfa originator, and currently available biosimilars of epoetin alfa; whether ESAs increase the risk of thromboembolism; and recommendations for ESA dosing and dose modifications with the recommended target HgB level. Questions also define nonresponse as < 1 to 2 g/dL increase in HgB or no decrease in transfusion requirements and ask whether continuation beyond 6 to 8 weeks provides a benefit, and whether iron supplementation concurrent with an ESA reduces transfusion requirements.

### JAK2V617F detection and dosage of serum erythropoietin: first steps of the diagnostic work-up for patients consulting for elevated hematocrit [^113eZLHf]. Haematologica (2007). Low credibility.

The predictive values of common biological criteria for the diagnosis of polycythemia vera were studied in a cohort of patients with high hematocrit. We found JAK2V617F and erythropoietin assays were the most relevant first tests. Classification of patients according to their JAK2V617F status and erythropoietin levels facilitated the choice of further diagnostic investigations.

### Erythropoietin (Procrit) [^114TKnq9]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

For all patients with CKD:

When initiating or adjusting therapy, monitor hemoglobin levels at least weekly until stable, then monitor at least monthly. When adjusting therapy consider hemoglobin rate of rise, rate of decline, ESA responsiveness and hemoglobin variability. A single hemoglobin excursion may not require a dosing change.

Do not increase the dose more frequently than once every 4 weeks. Decreases in dose can occur more frequently. Avoid frequent dose adjustments.
If the hemoglobin rises rapidly (e.g., more than 1 g/dL in any 2-week period), reduce the dose of PROCRIT by 25% or more as needed to reduce rapid responses.
For patients who do not respond adequately, if the hemoglobin has not increased by more than 1 g/dL after 4 weeks of therapy, increase the dose by 25%.
For patients who do not respond adequately over a 12-week escalation period, increasing the PROCRIT dose further is unlikely to improve response and may increase risks. Use the lowest dose that will maintain a hemoglobin level sufficient to reduce the need for RBC transfusions. Evaluate other causes of anemia. Discontinue PROCRIT if responsiveness does not improve.

For adult patients with CKD on dialysis:

Initiate PROCRIT treatment when the hemoglobin level is less than 10 g/dL.
If the hemoglobin level approaches or exceeds 11 g/dL, reduce or interrupt the dose of PROCRIT.
The recommended starting dose for adult patients is 50 to 100 Units/kg 3 times weekly intravenously or subcutaneously. The intravenous route is recommended for patients on hemodialysis.

For adult patients with CKD not on dialysis:

Consider initiating PROCRIT treatment only when the hemoglobin level is less than 10 g/dL and the following considerations apply:
The rate of hemoglobin decline indicates the likelihood of requiring a RBC transfusion and,
Reducing the risk of alloimmunization and/or other RBC transfusion-related risks is a goal
If the hemoglobin level exceeds 10 g/dL, reduce or interrupt the dose of PROCRIT, and use the lowest dose of PROCRIT sufficient to reduce the need for RBC transfusions.
The recommended starting dose for adult patients is 50 to 100 Units/kg 3 times weekly intravenously or subcutaneously.

### How to manage polycythemia vera [^112DVQRU]. Leukemia (2012). Low credibility.

My diagnostic approach in case of isolated erythrocytosis is based on the visit and the interview of patients, and on checking the causes of secondary erythrocytosis. If causes of secondary erythrocytosis are not evident and serum erythropoietin level is low-normal, I study JAK2 mutations. In the case of a patient with erythrocytosis and other signs of myeloproliferation, such as leukocytosis, thrombocytosis or splenomegaly, the diagnosis of polycythemia vera (PV) is likely, and I test serum erythropoietin and JAK2 mutations first. I stratify patients at diagnosis of PV according to age and history of thrombosis. I start hydroxyurea for patients who are at a high risk of thrombosis (that is, with one or two risk factors), while I continue only phlebotomy in other cases. All PV patients, if not contraindicated, receive aspirin. I follow up patients monthly until normalization of their blood cell counts or splenomegaly, and afterwards every 2 months with visit, cell blood count and blood smear evaluation. After diagnosis, I perform bone marrow biopsy only in the case of clinical signs of disease evolution.

### Epoetin alfa (Epogen) [^112c86oD]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1 		 	Important Dosing Information

Evaluation of Iron Stores and Nutritional Factors

Evaluate the iron status in all patients before and during treatment. Administer supplemental iron therapy when serum ferritin is less than 100 mcg/L or when serum transferrin saturation is less than 20%. The majority of patients with CKD will require supplemental iron during the course of ESA therapy.

Monitoring of Response to Therapy

Correct or exclude other causes of anemia (e.g., vitamin deficiency, metabolic or chronic inflammatory conditions, bleeding, etc.) before initiating Epogen. Following initiation of therapy and after each dose adjustment, monitor hemoglobin weekly until the hemoglobin level is stable and sufficient to minimize the need for RBC transfusion.

Selection of Formulation

In pregnant women, lactating women, neonates, and infants use only single-dose vials (the benzyl alcohol-free formulation) [see Contraindication s (4) and Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.2, and 8.4)].

2.2 Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease

In controlled trials, patients experienced greater risks for death, serious adverse cardiovascular reactions, and stroke when administered ESAs to target a hemoglobin level of greater than 11 g/dL. No trial has identified a hemoglobin target level, ESA dose, or dosing strategy that does not increase these risks.

### JAK2 unmutated erythrocytosis: 2023 update on diagnosis and management [^113F3KVi]. American Journal of Hematology (2023). Medium credibility.

Disease Overview

JAK2 unmutated or non-polycythemia vera (PV) erythrocytosis encompasses a heterogenous spectrum of hereditary and acquired entities.

Diagnosis

Foremost in the evaluation of erythrocytosis is the exclusion of PV through JAK2 (inclusive of exons 12–15) mutation screening. Initial assessment should also include gathering of previous records on hematocrit (Hct) and hemoglobin (Hgb) levels, in order to streamline the diagnostic process by first distinguishing longstanding from acquired erythrocytosis; subsequent subcategorization is facilitated by serum erythropoietin (Epo) measurement, germline mutation screening, and review of historical data, including comorbid conditions and medication list. Hereditary erythrocytosis constitutes the main culprit in the context of longstanding erythrocytosis, especially when associated with a positive family history. In this regard, a subnormal serum Epo level suggests EPO receptor mutation. Otherwise, considerations include those associated with decreased (high oxygen affinity Hgb variants, 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate deficiency, PIEZO1 mutations, methemoglobinemia) or normal oxygen tension at 50% Hgb saturation (P50). The latter include germline oxygen sensing pathway (HIF2A-PHD2-VHL) and other rare mutations. Acquired erythrocytosis commonly results from central (e.g., cardiopulmonary disease, high-altitude habitat) or peripheral (e.g., renal artery stenosis) hypoxia. Other noteworthy conditions associated with acquired erythrocytosis include Epo-producing tumors (e.g., renal cell carcinoma, cerebral hemangioblastoma) and drugs (e.g., testosterone, erythropoiesis stimulating agents, sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors). Idiopathic erythrocytosis is an ill-defined terminology that presumes the existence of an increased Hgb/Hct level without an identifiable etiology. Such classification often lacks accounting for normal outliers and is marred by truncated diagnostic evaluation.

Management

Current consensus treatment guidelines are not supported by hard evidence and their value is further undermined by limited phenotypic characterization and unfounded concerns for thrombosis. We are of the opinion that cytoreductive therapy and indiscriminate use of phlebotomy should be avoided in the treatment of non-clonal erythrocytosis. However, it is reasonable to consider therapeutic phlebotomy if one were to demonstrate value in symptom control, with frequency determined by symptoms rather than Hct level. In addition, cardiovascular risk optimization and low dose aspirin is often advised.

Future Directions

Advances in molecular hematology might result in better characterization of "idiopathic erythrocytosis" and expansion of the repertoire for germline mutations in hereditary erythrocytosis. Prospective controlled studies are needed to clarify potential pathology from JAK2 unmutated erythrocytosis, as well as to document the therapeutic value of phlebotomy.

### Epoetin alfa (Epogen) [^115feVzA]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.2 		 	Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease

In controlled trials, patients experienced greater risks for death, serious adverse cardiovascular reactions, and stroke when administered ESAs to target a hemoglobin level of greater than 11 g/dL. No trial has identified a hemoglobin target level, ESA dose, or dosing strategy that does not increase these risks. Individualize dosing and use the lowest dose of Epogen sufficient to reduce the need for RBC transfusions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Physicians and patients should weigh the possible benefits of decreasing transfusions against the increased risks of death and other serious cardiovascular adverse reactions [see Boxed Warning and Clinical Studies (14)].

For all patients with CKD:

When initiating or adjusting therapy, monitor hemoglobin levels at least weekly until stable, then monitor at least monthly. When adjusting therapy consider hemoglobin rate of rise, rate of decline, ESA responsiveness and hemoglobin variability. A single hemoglobin excursion may not require a dosing change.

Do not increase the dose more frequently than once every 4 weeks. Decreases in dose can occur more frequently. Avoid frequent dose adjustments.
If the hemoglobin rises rapidly (e.g., more than 1 g/dL in any 2-week period), reduce the dose of Epogen by 25% or more as needed to reduce rapid responses.
For patients who do not respond adequately, if the hemoglobin has not increased by more than 1 g/dL after 4 weeks of therapy, increase the dose by 25%.
For patients who do not respond adequately over a 12-week escalation period, increasing the Epogen dose further is unlikely to improve response and may increase risks. Use the lowest dose that will maintain a hemoglobin level sufficient to reduce the need for RBC transfusions. Evaluate other causes of anemia. Discontinue Epogen if responsiveness does not improve.

### Epoetin alfa-epbx (Retacrit) [^116rDdPd]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

For all patients with CKD:

When initiating or adjusting therapy, monitor hemoglobin levels at least weekly until stable, then monitor at least monthly. When adjusting therapy consider hemoglobin rate of rise, rate of decline, ESA responsiveness and hemoglobin variability. A single hemoglobin excursion may not require a dosing change.

Do not increase the dose more frequently than once every 4 weeks. Decreases in dose can occur more frequently. Avoid frequent dose adjustments.
If the hemoglobin rises rapidly (e.g., more than 1 g/dL in any 2-week period), reduce the dose of RETACRIT by 25% or more as needed to reduce rapid responses.
For patients who do not respond adequately, if the hemoglobin has not increased by more than 1 g/dL after 4 weeks of therapy, increase the dose by 25%.
For patients who do not respond adequately over a 12-week escalation period, increasing the RETACRIT dose further is unlikely to improve response and may increase risks. Use the lowest dose that will maintain a hemoglobin level sufficient to reduce the need for RBC transfusions. Evaluate other causes of anemia. Discontinue RETACRIT if responsiveness does not improve.

For adult patients with CKD on dialysis:

Initiate RETACRIT treatment when the hemoglobin level is less than 10 g/dL.
If the hemoglobin level approaches or exceeds 11 g/dL, reduce or interrupt the dose of RETACRIT.
The recommended starting dose for adult patients is 50 to 100 Units/kg 3 times weekly intravenously or subcutaneously. The intravenous route is recommended for patients on hemodialysis.

For adult patients with CKD not on dialysis:

Consider initiating RETACRIT treatment only when the hemoglobin level is less than 10 g/dL and the following considerations apply:
The rate of hemoglobin decline indicates the likelihood of requiring a RBC transfusion

and,
Reducing the risk of alloimmunization and/or other RBC transfusion-related risks is a goal
If the hemoglobin level exceeds 10 g/dL, reduce or interrupt the dose of RETACRIT, and use the lowest dose of RETACRIT sufficient to reduce the need for RBC transfusions.
The recommended starting dose for adult patients is 50 to 100 Units/kg 3 times weekly intravenously or subcutaneously.

Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) — erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) response predictors include baseline erythropoietin (EPO) and transfusion needs: patients with elevated baseline EPO levels (> 500 IU/L) are unlikely to respond, and ESAs should be avoided when EPO is elevated (> 500 IU/L), whereas an even lower EPO level (< 200 IU/L) is associated with a better Hb response; lower pretreatment red blood cell (RBC) transfusion dependence (< 2 units per month) has been associated with higher ESA response, and potential benefits include avoidance of secondary hemochromatosis in lower risk patients with years of expected survival.

### KDOQI clinical practice guideline and clinical practice recommendations for anemia in chronic kidney disease: 2007 update of hemoglobin target [^115s12Mi]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2007). Medium credibility.

KDOQI anemia guidelines — hemoglobin targets and transfusion — state that the selected hemoglobin (Hb) target should generally be in the range of 11.0 to 12.0 g/dL and that the Hb target should not be above 13.0 g/dL; they also state that no single Hb concentration justifies or requires transfusion and that the target Hb should not serve as a transfusion trigger. The epoetin alfa prescribing information lists when administered to target a Hb > 12 g/dL and that the Hb concentration should not exceed 12 g/dL, while labeling lists Hb < 10 g/dL as a starting Hb in chronic kidney disease. The guideline notes that selection of Hb target and selection of Hb level to initiate therapy are separate but related steps in medical decision-making and that to avoid achieved Hb > 12 g/dL would require a Hb target as low as 9.2 g/dL.

### JAK2 unmutated erythrocytosis: 2026 update on diagnosis and management [^111vEPYW]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). Medium credibility.

Disease Overview

JAK2 unmutated erythrocytosis encompasses a heterogeneous spectrum of hereditary and acquired entities.

Diagnosis

The foremost step is excluding polycythemia vera (PV) with JAK2 mutation screening (exons 12–15). Apparent polycythemia such as physiological outliers or relative polycythemia secondary to volume contraction should be considered. A historical overview of hematocrit (Hct) and hemoglobin (Hgb) levels helps distinguish longstanding from acquired erythrocytosis. Serum erythropoietin (Epo) levels are variably informative.

Hereditary Erythrocytosis

Hereditary erythrocytosis should be considered in longstanding erythrocytosis with a positive family history; causes include EPOR mutations (subnormal Epo), high oxygen affinity hemoglobin variants, PIEZO1 mutations, 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate deficiency, methemoglobinemia, and germline oxygen sensing pathway mutations (HIF2A-PHD2-VHL).

Acquired Erythrocytosis

Acquired erythrocytosis results from central (cardiopulmonary disease) or peripheral (renal artery stenosis) hypoxia, Epo-producing tumors (renal cell carcinoma) or drugs (testosterone, sodium glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2-i), erythropoiesis stimulating agents).

Idiopathic Erythrocytosis

Idiopathic erythrocytosis is an ill-defined terminology that presumes the existence of an increased Hgb/Hct level without an identifiable etiology.

Management

Cytoreductive therapy should be avoided. Phlebotomy should be considered for symptom control. Cardiovascular risk optimization and low-dose aspirin are advised, while the role of HIF2A inhibitors remains unclear.

Recent Advances

EPO mutations which produce hyperactive, hepatic-like Epo were identified. In cases with negative workup but high clinical suspicion, an expanded next generation sequencing panel for hereditary erythrocytosis is recommended. Among drugs, SGLT2-i-associated erythrocytosis is increasingly recognized.

Future Directions

Advances in molecular hematology are expected to improve the characterization of "idiopathic erythrocytosis". Results from prospective studies are needed to elucidate the underlying pathology and guide management.

### Pattern of resistance to erythropoietin-stimulating agents in chronic kidney disease [^116fXHqz]. Kidney International (2011). Low credibility.

Routine administration of erythropoietin (EPO)-stimulating agents (ESAs) for the control of anemia has improved the quality of life of subjects with chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, a wide variation in individual response to ESA is often observed. The reasons for EPO resistance include demographic variables such as age and gender distribution, morbidity pattern, and modality of dialysis. Despite suggestions by observational data, there is no biological characteristic that puts children at a disadvantage for adequate response to ESA. On the contrary, children possess a superior capacity for red cell production, including extramedullary erythropoiesis. The reasons for larger requirement of ESA in children (than in adults) are greater inflammatory burden, disproportionate blood loss, and greater EPO dosing by pediatric physicians. To minimize the harmful (including fatal) consequences of EPO resistance, surveillance programs must replenish nutrient (for example, iron and folate) stores, minimize oxidative hemolysis, control hyperparathyroidism, avoid catheter infection, and optimize uremic clearance. This clinical approach is justified by the inadequacy of laboratory diagnosis of pertinent etiological factors. Indeed, the best proof for functional nutrient deficiency is often a therapeutic trial. Finally, there are upcoming therapeutic agents that exploit the capacity for an endogenous EPO synthesis in CKD subjects, and may therefore minimize the off-target effect of excess dosages.

### Recombinant human erythropoietin for chronic renal failure anaemia in pre-dialysis patients [^111yaG8Z]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Treatment with recombinant human erythropoietin (rHu EPO) in dialysis patients has been shown to be highly effective in terms of correcting anaemia and improving quality of life. There is debate concerning the benefits of rHu EPO use in pre-dialysis patients which may accelerate the deterioration of renal function. However the opposing view is that if rHu EPO is as effective in pre-dialysis patient's, improving the patients sense of well-being may result in the onset of dialysis being delayed.

Objectives

To assess the effects of rHu EPO use in pre-dialysis patients with renal anaemia.

Search Strategy

The initial search included 13 electronic databases (1980 to May 2001) an internet search (August 1997), handsearching of Kidney International (1983 to May 1997), contact with known investigators and biomedical companies, and reference list of relevant articles. For this update we searched the Cochrane Renal Group's specialised register (June 2004) and The Cochrane Library (Issue 3, 2004).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs comparing the use of rHu EPO with no treatment or placebo in pre-dialysis patients.

Data Collection and Analysis

Only published data were used. Quality assessment was performed by two assessors independently. Data were abstracted by a single author onto a standard form, a sample of which was checked by another author. Results were expressed as relative risk (RR) or weighted mean difference (WMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

Fifteen trials (461 participants) were included. There was a marked improvement in haemoglobin (WMD 1.82 g/dL, 95% CI 1.35 to 2.28) and haematocrit (WMD 9.85%, 95% CI 8.35 to 11.34) with treatment and a decrease in the number of patients requiring blood transfusions (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.83). The data from studies reporting quality of life or exercise capacity demonstrated an improvement in the treatment group. Most of the measures of progression of renal disease showed no statistically significant difference. No significant increase in adverse events was identified.

Authors' Conclusions

Treatment with rHu EPO in pre-dialysis patients corrects anaemia, avoids the requirement for blood transfusions and also improves quality of life and exercise capacity. We were unable to assess the effects of rHu EPO on progression of renal disease, delay in the onset of dialysis or adverse events. Based on the current evidence, decisions on the putative benefits in terms of quality of life are worth the extra costs of pre-dialysis rHu EPO need careful evaluation.

### Revisiting diagnostic performances of serum erythropoïetin level and JAK2 mutation for polycythemias: analysis of a cohort of 1090 patients with red cell mass measurement [^113a2HJc]. British Journal of Haematology (2022). Medium credibility.

We assessed the diagnostic performances of erythropoietin and JAK2 mutations in 1,090 patients with suspected polycythemia who were referred for red cell mass (RCM) measurement. In patients with a high haematocrit and/or haemoglobin level, a low erythropoietin level (≤ 3.3 mUI/ml) and JAK2 mutation showed comparable positive predictive value (PPV) for true polycythemia (RCM ≥ 125%), 92.1% and 90% respectively. A very-low erythropoietin level (≤ 1.99 mUI/ml) had a PPV of 100% for polycythemia vera (PV) diagnosis. We confirmed the correlations between RCM, erythropoietin and JAK2 variant allelic frequency in PV patients. This study prompts the need to revisit the role of EPO in PV diagnostic criteria.

### The role of serum erythropoietin level and JAK2 V617F allele burden in the diagnosis of polycythaemia vera [^111MuMga]. British Journal of Haematology (2014). Low credibility.

Low serum erythropoietin (EPO) is a minor criterion of Polycythaemia Vera (PV) but its diagnostic usefulness relies on studies performed before the discovery of JAK2 V617F mutation. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of serum EPO and JAK2 V617F allele burden as markers of PV as well as the combination of different diagnostic criteria in 287 patients (99 with PV, 137 with Essential Thrombocythaemia and 51 with non-clonal erythrocytosis). Low EPO showed good diagnostic accuracy as a marker for PV, with the area under the curve (AUC) of the chemiluminescent-enhanced enzyme immunoassay (CEIA) being better than that of radioimmunoassay (RIA) (0.87 and 0.76 for CEIA and RIA, respectively). JAK2 V617F quantification displayed an excellent diagnostic accuracy, with an AUC of 0.95. A haematocrit > 52% (males) or > 48% (females) plus the presence of the JAK2 V617F mutation had a sensitivity and specificity of 79% and 97%, respectively. Adding low EPO or the JAK2 V617F allele burden did not improve the diagnostic accuracy for PV whereas the inclusion of both improved the sensitivity up to 83% and maintaining 96% specificity. Haematocrit and qualitative JAK2 V617F mutation allow a reliable diagnosis of PV. Incorporation of EPO and/or JAK2 V617F mutant load does not improve the diagnostic accuracy.

### Recombinant human erythropoietin versus placebo or no treatment for the anaemia of chronic kidney disease in people not requiring dialysis [^116WEA21]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Treatment with recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) in dialysis patients has been shown to be highly effective in terms of correcting anaemia and improving quality of life. There is debate concerning the benefits of rHuEPO use in predialysis patients which may accelerate the deterioration of kidney function. However the opposing view is that if rHuEPO is as effective in predialysis patients, improving the patient's sense of well-being may result in the onset of dialysis being delayed. This is an update of a review first published in 2001 and last updated in 2005.

Objectives

The objective of this review was to ascertain the effects of rHuEPO treatment in predialysis patients primarily in terms of the timing of the onset of dialysis; but also that predialysis rHuEPO: 1) corrects haemoglobin/haematocrit (markers of anaemia); 2) improves quality of life; and 3) is not associated with an increased incidence of adverse events such as hastening of the onset of dialysis, increased hypertension, clotting of arterio-venous fistulae or seizures.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant's Specialised Register (up to 29 June 2015) through contact with the Trials' Search Co-ordinator using search terms relevant to this review.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs comparing the use of rHuEPO with no treatment or placebo in predialysis patients.

Data Collection and Analysis

Only published data were used. Quality assessment was performed by two assessors independently. Data were abstracted by a single author onto a standard form, a sample of which was checked by another author. Results were expressed as risk ratio (RR) or mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

Nineteen studies (enrolling 993 participants) were included. Due to the age of the included studies (most performed prior to 2000) the risk of bias was judged to be unclear in the majority of the studies for most of the domains. There was an improvement in haemoglobin (MD 1.90 gm/L, 95% CI -2.34 to -1.47) and haematocrit (MD 9.85%, 95% CI 8.35 to 11.34) with treatment and a decrease in the number of patients requiring blood transfusions (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.83). The data from studies reporting quality of life or exercise capacity demonstrated an improvement in the treatment group. Most of the measures of progression of kidney disease showed no statistically significant difference. No significant increase in adverse events was identified.

Authors' Conclusions

Treatment with rHuEPO in predialysis patients corrects anaemia, avoids the requirement for blood transfusions and also improves quality of life and exercise capacity. We were unable to assess the effects of rHuEPO on progression of kidney disease, delay in the onset of dialysis or adverse events. Based on the current evidence, decisions on the putative benefits in terms of quality of life are worth the extra costs of predialysis rHuEPO need careful evaluation.

### Interpretation of erythropoietin levels in patients with various degrees of renal insufficiency and anemia [^111qnAmJ]. Kidney International (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic renal failure leads to hyporegenerative anemia due to erythropoietin deficiency. The creatinine clearance and hemoglobin levels, at which anemia treatment with recombinant erythropoietin should be started, are unclear. Interpretation of serum erythropoietin levels in the context of renal insufficiency remains controversial and was addressed in this study.

Methods

Three hundred and ninety-five patients were randomly chosen out of over 5000 consecutive patients investigated by coronary angiography at a single center between 1997 and 2001. Laboratory values and clinical information were prospectively collected in a central registry. Serum samples were frozen before angiography and now used to measure serum erythropoietin levels and evaluate the relationship between erythropoietin and hemoglobin levels in the context of various degrees of renal insufficiency.

Results

The patients with the lowest renal function (creatinine clearance < 20 mL/min) had significantly lower hemoglobin levels than the group with normal renal function. However, erythropoietin levels were identical indicating a lower set point for erythropoietin regulation. Above a creatinine clearance of 40 mL/min a significant inverse correlation between erythropoietin and hemoglobin levels was observed and described with the formula erythropoietin [U/L] = 2.5 × (140 − hemoglobin [g/L]) or alternatively Δerythropoietin (U/L) = −2.5 × Δhemoglobin (g/L). Below 40 mL/min no significant correlation was found.

Conclusion

A cut-off level for an altered set point of erythropoietin regulation was determined at 40 mL/min creatinine clearance. Above this cut-off hemoglobin negatively regulates erythropoietin. Below the cut-off erythropoietin levels remain stable. Pathophysiologic concepts for this finding and clinical implications in patients with moderate renal failure are discussed.

We asked the Cochrane HIV/AIDS and Pregnancy and Childbirth Groups to check their Specialised Registers. We also checked the reference lists of all trials identified by the above methods.

Selection Criteria

Randomized trials assessing the effects of treatments for anemia in people diagnosed with HIV infection. There were no age restrictions.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed relevant studies for inclusion. Data extraction and quality assessment of relevant studies was performed by two authors and checked by the other two authors.

Main Results

Six trials with a high risk of bias, including 537 patients, met the inclusion criteria. These trials only covered recombinant Human erythropoietin alfa (rHuEPO). Two of them including adult and paediatric participants (84 participants and 4 events) comparing rHuEPO to placebo did not reduce the risk of mortality with a follow up to 12 weeks (pooled RR 0.56, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.08 to 4.05, I(2) = 0%). Any trials that compared rHuEPO to placebo did not show any benefit on hematological values response, number of patients transfused, or number of packed red cell transfused. Two trial compared the effects of two rHuEPO dosing regimens on hemoglobin value and quality of life, but the effects are unclear. Three RCT reported high risk of attrition bias; therefore, were not included in a meta-analysis.

Authors' Conclusions

This updated Cochrane review provides evidence that rHuEPO compared with placebo does not reduce mortality, does not reduce transfusion requirements, did not increase hemoglobin levels, and did not improve quality of life in HIV-infected patients with anemia. The results are based on six RCTs with high risk of bias. Therefore prescription of this intervention for treating anemia in patients with AIDS is not justified, unless new evidence from a large high quality trial alters this conclusion.

### Timing and determinants of erythropoietin deficiency in chronic kidney disease [^1148NBGn]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Anemia in patients with CKD is highly related to impaired erythropoietin (EPO) response, the timing and determinants of which remain unknown.

Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements

This study measured EPO levels and studied their relation to GFR measured by 51Cr-EDTA renal clearance (mGFR) in 336 all-stage CKD patients not receiving any erythropoiesis-stimulating agent.

Results

In patients with anemia defined by World Health Organization criteria (hemoglobin [Hb] < 13 g/dl in men and 12 g/dl in women), EPO response to Hb level varied by mGFR level. EPO and Hb levels were negatively correlated (r = -0.22, P = 0.04) when mGFR was > 30 ml/min per 1.73 m(2), whereas they were not correlated when mGFR was < 30 (r = 0.09, P = 0.3; P for interaction = 0.01). In patients with anemia, the ratio of observed EPO to the level predicted by the equation for their Hb level decreased from 0.72 (interquartile range, 0.57–0.95) for mGFR ≥ 60 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) to 0.36 (interquartile range, 0.16–0.69) for mGFR < 15. Obesity, diabetes with nephropathy other than diabetic glomerulopathy, absolute iron deficiency, and high C-reactive protein concentrations were associated with increased EPO levels, independent of Hb and mGFR.

Conclusions

Anemia in CKD is marked by an early relative EPO deficiency, but several factors besides Hb may persistently stimulate EPO synthesis. Although EPO deficiency is likely the main determinant of anemia in patients with advanced CKD, the presence of anemia in those with mGFR > 30 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) calls for other explanatory factors.

### Epoetin alfa-epbx (Retacrit) [^116ybF9M]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1 Important Dosing Information

Evaluation of Iron Stores and Nutritional Factors

Evaluate the iron status in all patients before and during treatment. Administer supplemental iron therapy when serum ferritin is less than 100 mcg/L or when serum transferrin saturation is less than 20%. The majority of patients with CKD will require supplemental iron during the course of ESA therapy.

Monitoring of Response to Therapy

Correct or exclude other causes of anemia (e.g., vitamin deficiency, metabolic or chronic inflammatory conditions, bleeding, etc.) before initiating RETACRIT. Following initiation of therapy and after each dose adjustment, monitor hemoglobin weekly until the hemoglobin level is stable and sufficient to minimize the need for RBC transfusion.

Selection of Formulation

In pregnant women, lactating women, neonates, and infants use only single-dose vials (the benzyl alcohol-free formulation) [see Contraindications (4) and Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.2, and 8.4)].

2.2 Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease

In controlled trials, patients experienced greater risks for death, serious adverse cardiovascular reactions, and stroke when administered ESAs to target a hemoglobin level of greater than 11 g/dL. No trial has identified a hemoglobin target level, ESA dose, or dosing strategy that does not increase these risks. Individualize dosing and use the lowest dose of RETACRIT sufficient to reduce the need for RBC transfusions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Physicians and patients should weigh the possible benefits of decreasing transfusions against the increased risks of death and other serious cardiovascular adverse reactions [see Boxed Warning and Clinical Studies (14)].

### A critical reappraisal of the WHO classification of the chronic myeloproliferative disorders [^115BV887]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2006). Low credibility.

Following the introduction of the WHO classification of chronic myeloproliferative disorders (MPDs), after approximately 5 years, a critical reappraisal appears to be warranted. Retrospective clinico-pathological evaluations conducted in the meantime, as well as the detection of new biomarkers, may aid in testing the validity of these new criteria. Based on a large series of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), an analysis of bone marrow (BM) features and risk classifications revealed that the fiber content exerted a most important and independent impact on prognosis. This finding was also supported in a prospective randomized study and therefore myelofibrosis should be included in any staging system in CML related to survival. Moreover, it is important to emphasize the dynamics of the disease process in MPDs, especially in polycythemia vera (PV) and chronic idiopathic myelofibrosis (CIMF). Latent-stage PV is difficult to recognize when adhering to the proposed limits for hemoglobin (or red cell mass) without regarding the erythropoietin (EPO) level, endogenous erythroid colonies (EECs) or BM histopathology. Initial PV may firstly present with complications and, when accompanied by a high platelet count, mimics essential thrombocythemia (ET). Consequently, BM morphology and EPO level should be entered as major diagnostic criteria for PV. To document more accurately the progress of disease, a simplified scoring system concerning myelofibrosis has to be included in the histological description of CIMF. The diagnostic guidelines of BM features in ET should be improved because, usually, there is neither a significant proliferation nor left-shifting of the granulo- and erythropoiesis detectable and no relevant increase in reticulin. A comparison of clinical data and BM morphology reveals that biomarkers (EPO, EECs, PRV-1, JAK2) show an overlapping pattern of positivity between the different subtypes of MPDs.

If response is inadequate, increase epoetin alfa to 300 U/kg SC TIW or to 60,000 U SC weekly if HbG increases by < 1 g/dL and remains below 10 g/dL after 4 weeks of therapy; increase darbepoetin alfa to 4.5 μg/kg weekly if HbG increases by < 1 g/dL and remains below 10 g/dL after 6 weeks of therapy. For dose reduction, decrease epoetin alfa by 25% when HbG reaches a level needed to avoid transfusion or HbG increases > 1 g/dL in 2 weeks, and decrease darbepoetin alfa by 40% when HbG reaches a level needed to avoid transfusion or HbG increases ≥ 1 g/dL in 2 weeks. If HbG exceeds a level needed to avoid transfusion, restart epoetin alfa at 25% below previous dose and darbepoetin alfa at 40% below previous dose when HbG approaches a level where transfusion may be required. Discontinue following completion of chemotherapy or if no response after 8 weeks of therapy (measured by HbG levels or continuing need for transfusions).

### Treatment for anemia in people with AIDS [^1169Se2N]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Anemia is a common clinical disease in persons with HIV infection and is associated with poor prognosis. There is a need to assess the effects of anemia treatments, and to determine whether these interventions are beneficial.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy and safety of treatments for anemia in people with HIV infection and AIDS.

Search Strategy

The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library Issue 3, 2005), MEDLINE (1980-July 2005), EMBASE (1980-July 2005), LlLACS (1982 to July 2005), reference lists of relevant articles and contact with authors. See Cochrane HIV/AIDS Group search strategy.

Selection Criteria

Randomized trials assessing the effects of treatments for anemia in people diagnosed with HIV infection. There were no age restrictions.

Data Collection and Analysis

Both authors independently assessed relevant studies for inclusion. Data extraction and quality assessment of relevant studies was performed by one author and checked by the other author.

Main Results

We included four trials, but focused on the results based on three trials with acceptable attrition rate. None of the trials reported data on death. The two trials that compared recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) to placebo did not show any benefit on hematological values response, number of patients transfused, or number of packed red cell transfused. One trial compared the effects of two rHuEPO dosing regimens on hemoglobin value and quality of life, but the effects are unclear.

Authors' Conclusions

There is a lack of reliable evidence on interventions for treating anemia in patients with HIV infection. This Cochrane review has found some evidence that rHuEPO reduces transfusion requirements, increases hemoglobin levels, and improves quality of life in HIV-infected patients with anemia. However, this is based on evidence from randomized trials with weak or poor methodological quality. There is a need for randomized trials of high methodological quality to evaluate the effect of interventions on anemia in persons infected with human immunodeficiency virus.

2.4 		 	Patients on Cancer Chemotherapy

Initiate Epogen in patients on cancer chemotherapy only if the hemoglobin is less than 10 g/dL, and if there is a minimum of two additional months of planned chemotherapy.

Use the lowest dose of Epogen necessary to avoid RBC transfusions.

Recommended Starting Dose

Adults:

150 Units/kg subcutaneously 3 times per week until completion of a chemotherapy course or
40,000 Units subcutaneously weekly until completion of a chemotherapy course.

Pediatric Patients (5 to 18 years):

600 Units/kg intravenously weekly until completion of a chemotherapy course.

Dose Reduction

Reduce dose by 25% if:

Hemoglobin increases greater than 1 g/dL in any 2-week period or
Hemoglobin reaches a level needed to avoid RBC transfusion.

Withhold dose if hemoglobin exceeds a level needed to avoid RBC transfusion. Reinitiate at a dose 25% below the previous dose when hemoglobin approaches a level where RBC transfusions may be required.

Dose Increase

After the initial 4 weeks of Epogen therapy, if hemoglobin increases by less than 1 g/dL and remains below 10 g/dL, increase dose to:

300 Units/kg three times per week in adults or
60,000 Units weekly in adults
900 Units/kg (maximum 60,000 Units) weekly in pediatric patients

After 8 weeks of therapy, if there is no response as measured by hemoglobin levels or if RBC transfusions are still required, discontinue Epogen.

2.5 		 	Surgery Patients

The recommended Epogen regimens are:

300 Units/kg per day subcutaneously for 15 days total: administered daily for 10 days before surgery, on the day of surgery, and for 4 days after surgery.
600 Units/kg subcutaneously in 4 doses administered 21, 14, and 7 days before surgery and on the day of surgery.

Deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis is recommended during Epogen therapy [see Warning s and Precautions (5.1)].

Chronic Kidney Disease:

In controlled trials, patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) experienced greater risks for death, serious adverse cardiovascular reactions, and stroke when administered erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) to target a hemoglobin level of greater than 11 g/dL [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].
No trial has identified a hemoglobin target level, E SA dose, or dosing strategy that does not increase these risks [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].
Use the lowest Epogen dose sufficient to reduce the need for red blood cell (RBC) transfusions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Cancer:

ESAs shortened overall survival and/or increased the risk of tumor progression or recurrence in clinical studies of patients with breast, non-small cell lung, head and neck, lymphoid, and cervical cancers [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].
To decrease these risks, as well as the risk of serious cardiovascular and thromboembolic reactions, use the lowest dose needed to avoid RBC transfusions [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].
Use ESAs only for anemia from myelosuppressive chemotherapy [see Indications and Usage (1.3)].
ESAs are not indicated for patients receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy when the anticipated outcome is cure [see Indications and Usage (1.5)].

### Increased fetal plasma and amniotic fluid erythropoietin concentrations: markers of intrauterine hypoxia [^112ECg9W]. Neonatology (2009). Low credibility.

Tissue hypoxia is the major stimulus of erythropoietin (EPO) synthesis in fetuses and adults. Since EPO does not cross the placenta and is not stored, fetal plasma and amniotic fluid levels indicate EPO synthesis and elimination. Acutely, the rate and magnitude of the increase in plasma EPO levels correlate with the intensity of hypoxia. Amniotic fluid EPO levels correlate with cord plasma levels in normal and abnormal pregnancies, with fetal plasma EPO levels in humans averaging 2.6 times higher than the corresponding amniotic fluid EPO levels. Recent experimental and clinical studies demonstrate that EPO has neuroprotective effects related to its anti-apoptotic and vascular growth-promoting properties. Although under basal conditions the fetal kidneys are the main site of EPO production, during hypoxia recent experimental data indicate an important role of the placenta. Amniotic fluid EPO levels have been shown to increase exponentially during fetal hypoxia in preeclamptic, diabetic and Rh-immunized pregnancies, to correlate inversely with cord blood pH, pO(2) and base excess and to predict neonatal morbidities and NICU admission. As an indicator of chronic intrauterine hypoxia, fetal EPO measurements have increased our knowledge about the pathogenesis and importance of intrauterine growth restriction, macrosomia, diabetic pregnancy, prolonged pregnancy, meconium staining, fetal hemorrhage, fetal anemia, maternal smoking and alcohol consumption, abnormal fetal heart rate and abnormal Doppler flow patterns. While the clinical utility of fetal amniotic fluid and plasma EPO measurements in the management of high-risk pregnancies and their offspring is promising, adequately powered clinical trials are urgently needed.

2.1 Important Dosing Information

Evaluation of Iron Stores and Nutritional Factors

Evaluate the iron status in all patients before and during treatment. Administer supplemental iron therapy when serum ferritin is less than 100 mcg/L or when serum transferrin saturation is less than 20%. The majority of patients with CKD will require supplemental iron during the course of ESA therapy.

Monitoring of Response to Therapy

Correct or exclude other causes of anemia (e.g., vitamin deficiency, metabolic or chronic inflammatory conditions, bleeding, etc.) before initiating Mircera [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)].

Polycythemia vera (PV) diagnostic criteria and masked PV — thresholds and bone marrow biopsy role: The 2017 World Health Organization (WHO) criteria refined PV assessment to differentiate masked PV from essential thrombocythemia (ET), recognizing biopsy utility when hemoglobin is < 18.5 g/dL in men and < 16.5 g/dL in women. In an international series, 257/397 had overt PV by 2008 WHO criteria and 140/397 had masked PV with hemoglobin at diagnosis < 18.5 g/dL in males (range, 16.0–18.4 g/dL) and < 16.5 g/dL in females (range, 15.0–16.4 g/dL), often with subnormal erythropoietin (EPO). Masked PV independently predicted poor survival in patients aged > 65 years with leukocyte count > 10 × 10⁹/L, whereas without these risk factors outcomes were similar to overt PV; overall, OS, thrombosis, major bleeding, and transformation rates were similar between masked and overt PV. Major PV criteria were refined to include hemoglobin levels (> 16.5 g/dL in men and > 16.0 g/dL in women) or hematocrit > 49% in men and > 48% in women plus bone marrow biopsy to confirm age-adjusted hypercellularity. Bone marrow biopsy may not be required for sustained absolute erythrocytosis with hemoglobin > 18.5 g/dL in men [hematocrit > 55.5%] or > 16.5 g/dL in women [hematocrit > 49.5%] and presence of JAK2 V617F or JAK2 exon 12 mutations with subnormal serum EPO, though biopsy can still provide helpful prognostic information.

### Erythropoietin mimics the acute phase response in critical illness [^113THH4F]. Critical Care (2003). Low credibility.

Background

In a prospective observational study, we examined the temporal relationships between serum erythropoietin (EPO) levels, haemoglobin concentration and the inflammatory response in critically ill patients with and without acute renal failure (ARF).

Patients and Method

Twenty-five critically ill patients, from general and cardiac intensive care units (ICUs) in a university hospital, were studied. Eight had ARF and 17 had normal or mildly impaired renal function. The comparator group included 82 nonhospitalized patients with normal renal function and varying haemoglobin concentrations. In the patients, levels of haemoglobin, serum EPO, C-reactive protein, IL-1beta, IL-6, serum iron, ferritin, vitamin B12 and folate were measured, and Coombs test was performed from ICU admission until discharge or death. Concurrent EPO and haemoglobin levels were measured in the comparator group.

Results

EPO levels were initially high in patients with ARF, falling to normal or low levels by day 3. Thereafter, almost all ICU patients demonstrated normal or low EPO levels despite progressive anaemia. IL-6 exhibited a similar initial pattern, but levels remained elevated during the chronic phase of critical illness. IL-1beta was undetectable. Critically ill patients could not be distinguished from nonhospitalized anaemic patients on the basis of EPO levels.

Conclusion

EPO levels are markedly elevated in the initial phase of critical illness with ARF. In the chronic phase of critical illness, EPO levels are the same for patients with and those without ARF, and cannot be distinguished from noncritically ill patients with varying haemoglobin concentrations. Exogenous EPO therapy is unlikely to be effective in the first few days of critical illness.

### Myeloproliferative neoplasms, version 3.2022, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^114NpGUc]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2022). High credibility.

WHO and ICC diagnostic criteria — polycythemia vera (PV): The diagnosis of PV requires either all 3 major criteria or the first 2 major criteria plus the minor criterion. Major criteria are elevated hemoglobin concentration (> 16.5 g/dL in men, > 16.0 g/dL in women) or elevated hematocrit (> 49% in men, > 48% in women); bone marrow biopsy showing age-adjusted hypercellularity with trilineage proliferation (panmyelosis), including prominent erythroid, granulocytic, and megakaryocytic proliferation with pleomorphic, mature megakaryocytes (differences in size); and presence of JAK2 p.V617F or JAK2 exon 12 mutation. The minor criterion is subnormal serum erythropoietin level. Major criterion 2 (bone marrow biopsy) may not be required in patients with sustained absolute erythrocytosis (hemoglobin concentrations of > 18.5 g/dL in men or > 16.5 g/dL in women, or hematocrit values of > 55.5% in men or > 49.5% in women) if major criterion 3 and the minor criterion are present. In the absence of a JAK2 mutation, a higher hematocrit target (eg, 52%) could be considered in men before further investigation is required.

### The 2016 revision to the World Health Organization classification of myeloid neoplasms and acute leukemia [^112YmPuo]. Blood (2016). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "WHO criteria for polycythemia vera in women" for polycythemia vera.

The World Health Organization (WHO) criteria for polycythemia vera in women is a diagnostic tool designed to identify the presence of this myeloproliferative disorder. The target patient population includes women presenting with symptoms suggestive of polycythemia vera, such as fatigue, headache, dizziness, and pruritus.

The primary components of the WHO criteria include three major criteria and one minor criterion. The major criteria encompass elevated hemoglobin or hematocrit levels, bone marrow biopsy findings indicative of hypercellularity with trilineage growth, and the presence of JAK2 V617F or JAK2 exon 12 mutation. The minor criterion involves a subnormal serum erythropoietin level.

The diagnostic result is determined based on the combination of these criteria. The diagnosis of polycythemia vera is confirmed if all three major criteria are met or if the first two major criteria and the minor criterion are met. If these combinations are not fulfilled, the diagnostic criteria for polycythemia vera are not met.

The WHO criteria for polycythemia vera in women provides a structured approach to diagnosis, facilitating early detection and treatment of this condition.

The process determines if the diagnostic criteria for polycythemia vera in women, based on WHO guidelines, are met. This involves analyzing both major and minor clinical indicators.

Major criteria encompass:

- Elevated hemoglobin levels greater than 16 g/dL, or a hematocrit exceeding 48%, or a notable increase in red blood cell mass
- A bone marrow biopsy indicating hypercellularity relative to age, showing increased activity across three hematopoietic lineages, including significant erythroid, granulocytic, and megakaryocytic proliferation, with diverse, fully mature megakaryocytes
- The presence of JAK2 V617F or JAK2 exon 12 mutation

The minor criterion involves a subnormal serum erythropoietin level.

To determine if the conditions for diagnosis are satisfied, the following procedure is used:

1. **For the major criteria**:

- Condition A is established if hemoglobin parameters meet the threshold or red blood cell mass is elevated.
- Condition B is confirmed when the bone marrow biopsy reveals specific hypercellular growth across multiple hematopoietic lineages.
- Condition C implies the detection of specific JAK2 mutations.

2. The minor criterion:

- Condition D is satisfied if there is a lower than normal level of serum erythropoietin.

Diagnosis is confirmed if:

- All three major criteria (A, B, C) are met, or
- The first two major criteria (A and B) are fulfilled, alongside the minor criterion (D).

If these combinations are fulfilled, the criteria for diagnosing polycythemia vera are considered met. If not, the criteria are not met. This approach integrates clinical assessments, bone marrow examination, and genetic testing, offering a comprehensive check to accurately establish the presence of polycythemia vera in women.

### Frequency of administration of recombinant human erythropoietin for anaemia of end-stage renal disease in dialysis patients [^111Hg52o]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Background

The benefits of recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) administration in dialysis patients have been demonstrated, however the optimal frequency regimen have yet to be established.

Objectives

To assess the effects of different frequency regimens of rHuEPO administration in dialysis patients on anaemia correction, quality of life and optimal use.

Search Strategy

We searched 13 electronic databases (1980 to May 2001) the internet (August 1997), handsearched Kidney International (1983 to May 1997), contacted known investigators, biomedical companies, and screened reference lists of relevant articles. Most recent search: The Cochrane Renal Group's specialised register (June 2004) and The Cochrane Library (Issue 3, 2004).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs comparing different frequencies of rHuEPO administration in dialysis patients. We compared haemodialysis and CAPD patients and subcutaneous and intravenous administration.

Data Collection and Analysis

Quality assessment was performed by two assessors. Data were abstracted by a single author onto a standard form, and a sample was checked by another author. Results were expressed as relative risk (RR) or weighted mean difference (WMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

Eleven studies (719 patients) were included. There was no significant difference in maintaining target haemoglobin for once versus twice weekly administration (one study, 20 patients: RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.42 to 2.40) or mean haemoglobin after 12 weeks of therapy between haemodialysis and CAPD patients (two studies: WMD -0.21 g/dL, 95% CI -0.98 to 0.56) At the end of study for once versus thrice weekly administration (three studies: SMD -0.31, 95% CI -0.67 to 0.06) and at the end of maintenance phase (one study: WMD -0.2 g/dL, 95% CI -0.65 to 0.25) there was no significant difference. More rHuEPO was required by haemodialysis patients receiving once weekly versus twice weekly doses (WMD 12.0 U/kg, 95% CI 0.24 to 23.76). No difference was found for CAPD patients alone or combined (WMD 4.38 U/kg, 95% CI -11.28 to 20.04). Once versus thrice weekly administration was not significant (WMD 10.00 U/kg, 95% CI -80.87 to 100.87). There was no difference in the frequency of adverse events.

Authors' Conclusions

There is no significant difference between once weekly versus thrice weekly subcutaneous administration of rHuEPO. Once weekly administration would require an additional 12 U/kg/wk for patients on haemodialysis, however this is based on one very small study. Cost of additional rHuEPO needs to assessed with regard to patient preference and compliance.

### The 2016 revision to the World Health Organization classification of myeloid neoplasms and acute leukemia [^113MxY3L]. Blood (2016). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "WHO criteria for polycythemia vera in men" for polycythemia vera.

The World Health Organization (WHO) criteria for polycythemia vera in men is a diagnostic tool designed to identify the presence of this myeloproliferative disorder. The target patient population includes men presenting with symptoms suggestive of polycythemia vera, such as fatigue, headache, dizziness, and pruritus.

The primary components of the WHO criteria include three major criteria and one minor criterion. The major criteria encompass elevated hemoglobin or hematocrit levels, bone marrow biopsy findings indicative of hypercellularity with trilineage growth, and the presence of JAK2 V617F or JAK2 exon 12 mutations. The minor criterion involves a subnormal serum erythropoietin level.

The diagnostic result is determined by the presence of either all three major criteria or the first two major criteria along with the minor criterion. If these combinations are not met, the diagnostic criteria for polycythemia vera are not fulfilled. This scoring system aids in the accurate diagnosis of polycythemia vera, enabling appropriate management and treatment strategies to be implemented.

This tool is designed to assist in evaluating whether the WHO criteria for diagnosing polycythemia vera in men are met. This condition is assessed using a combination of major and minor criteria specified by the WHO. For successful diagnosis, specific combinations of these criteria must be satisfied.

Input Criteria:

- **Major Criteria**:

- Hemoglobin greater than 16.5 g/dL or hematocrit above 49% or an increased red blood cell mass.
- Bone marrow biopsy shows hypercellularity for age with trilineage growth, indicating proliferation of erythroid, granulocytic, and megakaryocytic cells along with mature megakaryocytes that are pleomorphic.
- Presence of a JAK2 V617F or JAK2 exon 12 mutation.

- **Minor Criterion**:

- Subnormal serum erythropoietin level.

By selecting an option from the major criteria and, if necessary, the minor criterion, the tool evaluates if the pertinent criteria combinations are met.

Interpretations:

- **Polycythemia vera diagnosis is confirmed if**:

- All three major criteria are present.
- The first two major criteria (Hemoglobin/Hematocrit and Bone Marrow) and the minor criterion (subnormal erythropoietin level) are met.

These criteria ensure the diagnosis is robust, focusing on hallmark signs of erythrocytosis alongside key genetic and bone marrow characteristics. If these combinations are fulfilled, the tool concludes that diagnostic criteria are met. If not, it suggests that criteria for diagnosis are not met, highlighting the need for further investigation or consideration of other conditions.

### Evaluation of WHO criteria for diagnosis of polycythemia vera: a prospective analysis [^113xaLY7]. Blood (2013). Low credibility.

We prospectively evaluated the accuracy of the 2007 World Health Organization (WHO) criteria for diagnosing polycythemia vera (PV), especially in "early-stage" patients. A total of 28 of 30 patients were diagnosed as PV owing to an elevated Cr-51 red cell mass (RCM), JAK2 positivity, and at least 1 minor criterion. A total of 18 PV patients did not meet the WHO criterion for an increased hemoglobin value and 8 did not meet the WHO criterion for an increased hematocrit value. Bone marrow morphology was very valuable for diagnosis. Low serum erythropoietin (EPO) values were specific for PV, but normal EPO values were found at presentation (20%). We recommend revision of the WHO criteria, especially to distinguish early-stage PV from essential thrombocythemia. Major criteria remain JAK2 positivity and increased red cell volume, but Cr-51 RCM is mandatory for patients who do not meet the defined elevated hemoglobin or hematocrit value (> 18.5 g/dL and 60% in men and > 16.5 g/dL and 56% in women, respectively). Minor criteria remain bone marrow histology or a low serum EPO value. For patients with a normal EPO value, marrow examination is mandatory for diagnostic confirmation. Because the therapies for myeloproliferative disorders differ, our data have major clinical implications.

### Annual clinical updates in hematological malignancies: a continuing medical education series: polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia: 2011 update on diagnosis, risk-stratification, and management [^113qgqA5]. American Journal of Hematology (2011). Low credibility.

Disease Overview

Polycythemia vera (PV) and essential thrombocythemia (ET) are myeloproliferative neoplasms primarily characterized by erythrocytosis and thrombocytosis, respectively. Other disease features include leukocytosis, splenomegaly, thrombohemorrhagic complications, vasomotor disturbances, pruritus, and a small risk of disease progression into acute leukemia or myelofibrosis.

Diagnosis

Diagnosis is based on JAK2 mutation status (PV and ET), serum erythropoietin (Epo) level (PV), and bone marrow histopathology (ET). The presence of a JAK2 mutation and subnormal serum Epo level confirm a diagnosis of PV. Differential diagnosis in ET should include chronic myelogenous leukemia and prefibrotic myelofibrosis.

Risk Stratification

Current risk stratification in PV and ET is designed to estimate the likelihood of thrombotic complications: high-risk-age > 60 years or presence of thrombosis history; low-risk-absence of both of these two risk factors. Presence of extreme thrombocytosis (platelet count > 1,000 × 10⁹/L) might be associated with acquired von Willebrand syndrome (AvWS) and, therefore, risk of bleeding. Risk factors for shortened survival in both PV and ET include age > 60 years, leukocytosis, history of thrombosis, and anemia.

Risk-Adapted Therapy

Survival is near-normal in ET and reasonably long in PV. The 10-year risk of leukemic/fibrotic transformation is < 1%/1% in ET and < 5%/10% in PV. In contrast, the risk of thrombosis exceeds 20%. The main goal of therapy is therefore to prevent thrombohemorrhagic complications and this is effectively and safely accomplished by the use of low-dose aspirin (PV and ET), phlebotomy (PV), and hydroxyurea (high risk PV and ET). Treatment with busulfan or interferon-a is usually effective in hydroxyurea failures.

### Epoetin alfa (Epogen) [^113fTEXH]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

6.3 		 	Immunogenicity

As with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for immunogenicity. The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors, including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to epoetin alfa with the incidence of antibodies to other products may be misleading.

Neutralizing antibodies to epoetin alfa that cross-react with endogenous erythropoietin and other ESAscan result in PRCA or severe anemia (with or without other cytopenias) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].

2.1 		 	Important Dosing Information

Evaluation of Iron Stores and Nutritional Factors

Evaluate the iron status in all patients before and during treatment. Administer supplemental iron therapy when serum ferritin is less than 100 mcg/L or when serum transferrin saturation is less than 20%. The majority of patients with CKD will require supplemental iron during the course of ESA therapy.

Monitoring of Response to Therapy

Correct or exclude other causes of anemia (e.g., vitamin deficiency, metabolic or chronic inflammatory conditions, bleeding, etc.) before initiating Aranesp. Following initiation of therapy and after each dose adjustment, monitor hemoglobin weekly until the hemoglobin level is stable and sufficient to minimize the need for RBC transfusion.

12.1 		 	Mechanism of Action

Epogen stimulates erythropoiesis by the same mechanism as endogenous erythropoietin.

12.2 		 	Pharmacodynamics

Epogen increases the reticulocyte count within 10 days of initiation, followed by increases in the RBC count, hemoglobin, and hematocrit, usually within 2 to 6 weeks. The rate of hemoglobin increase varies among patients and is dependent upon the dose of Epogen administered. For correction of anemia in hemodialysis patients, a greater biologic response is not observed at doses exceeding 300 Units/kg 3 times weekly.

Implementation issues: In clinical practice, individualized anemia management in chronic kidney disease (CKD) requires selection of the starting Hb level, initial erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) dose/route/frequency, Hb monitoring frequency, the aspirational threshold or target Hb, and rules for sequential ESA dose adjustments, but available randomized controlled trials used either a range or a discrete value for the target Hb and published reports include little additional information to assist decision making; information is lacking about how ESA and iron therapy were actually adjusted and about comparative data to determine optimum monitoring frequency and the number of Hb results needed to reliably measure clinical performance.

### Association between repeat hospitalization and early intervention in dialysis patients following hospital discharge [^116Kf5Pk]. Kidney International (2009). Low credibility.

Dialysis patients have a greater number of hospitalization events compared to patients without renal failure. Here we studied the relationship between different post-discharge interventions and repeat hospitalization in over 126,000 prevalent hemodialysis patients to explore outpatient strategies that minimize the risk of repeat hospitalization. The primary outcome was repeat hospitalization within 30 days of discharge. Compared to pre-hospitalization values, the levels of hemoglobin, albumin, phosphorus, calcium, and parathyroid hormone and weight were significantly decreased after hospitalization. Using covariate-adjusted models, those patients whose hemoglobin was monitored within the first 7 days after discharge, followed by modification of their erythropoietin dose had a significantly reduced risk for repeat-hospitalization when compared to the patients whose hemoglobin was not checked, nor was the dose of erythropoietin changed. Similarly, administration of vitamin D within the 7 days following discharge was significantly associated with reduced repeat hospitalization when compared to patients on no vitamin D. Therefore, it appears that immediate re-evaluation of anemia management orders and resumption of vitamin D soon after discharge may be an effective way to reduce repeat hospitalization.

### Diagnosis and management of iron-related anemias in critical illness [^115Z32UM]. Critical Care Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To review of the prevalence, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and management of iron (Fe)-related anemias in critical illness.

Data Source

A MEDLINE/PubMed search from 1966 to October 2005 was conducted. References from relevant articles were manually cross-referenced with additional original articles, review articles, correspondence, and chapters from selected textbooks.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Both Fe metabolism and erythropoiesis are affected by the inflammatory response that accompanies critical illness. As a result, many critically ill patients develop the anemia of inflammation, which may be compounded by an underlying Fe deficiency. Most commonly available markers of total body Fe detect Fe deficiency unreliably in the setting of inflammation. Among these tests, the serum transferrin receptor assay is relatively accurate in reflecting total body Fe, regardless of inflammation. Treatment options for Fe-related anemias in critical illness include Fe replacement and recombinant human erythropoietin therapy. The decision to implement these therapies is complex and centers on a critical evaluation of ability to affect anemia, morbidity, and mortality in critical illness and on the potential risks of therapy.

Conclusions

Fe deficiency anemia and the anemia of inflammation may co-exist in critical illness. Diagnosis of and differentiation between these two anemias involves careful interpretation of multiple markers of total body Fe stores. The utility of treatment with both Fe and recombinant human erythropoietin for these disorders during critical illness requires further investigation.

### Mechanisms of anemia in CKD [^115y47Jv]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on anemia of chronic kidney disease:

- **Definition**: Anemia of CKD is usually normocytic, normochromic, and hypoproliferative, which increases as the kidney disease progresses.
- **Pathophysiology**: Anemia of CKD is mostly caused by a relative deficiency in EPO (EPO) production. Other causes include inflammation, iron deficiency, and accumulation of uremic toxins.
- **Disease course**: Decreased production of EPO due to worsening kidney function results in anemia of CKD, which causes clinical manifestations of decreased QoL, cognitive impairment, sleep disturbances, CKD progression, and cardiovascular comorbidities.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Anemia of CKD among diabetics is associated with higher mortality (HR 3.61, 95% CI 2.48–5.26).
