## Question

What kind of ultrasound to order for irregular menstrual bleeding

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what kind of ultrasound to order for irregular menstrual bleeding. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether the patient is premenopausal, postmenopausal, or adolescent. Then, I should verify pregnancy status because that changes the imaging pathway entirely. Next, I will consider the first-line ultrasound modality and when to add Doppler. After that, I need to check when saline infusion sonohysterography is indicated. Finally, I should review what to do if ultrasound is nondiagnostic and how to integrate endometrial sampling and MRI when appropriate.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context because the imaging choice hinges on menopausal status and pregnancy. In premenopausal patients with abnormal uterine bleeding, transvaginal ultrasound is the first-line imaging modality in most cases, whereas in postmenopausal bleeding I need to ensure endometrial cancer is excluded and use transvaginal ultrasound to triage endometrial thickness before deciding on biopsy, and in adolescents routine ultrasound is not recommended initially because most bleeding is hormonal rather than structural [^111yLe7z] [^115TQ1ND] [^115YfCr6].

> Wait, let me verify pregnancy status before anything else, because if there is any possibility of pregnancy, first-trimester bleeding protocols apply and ultrasound is the primary imaging to distinguish intrauterine pregnancy, ectopic pregnancy, and early pregnancy failure, with transvaginal ultrasound preferred when feasible and transabdominal as an adjunct if needed, and I should correlate with quantitative hCG to guide management and avoid premature intervention [^113dWHe4] [^114JhVC8].

> For a premenopausal patient with irregular bleeding who is not pregnant, I should order transvaginal ultrasound as the initial study because it best visualizes the endometrium and uterine cavity and can detect polyps, fibroids, adenomyosis, and endometrial hyperplasia, and I should add color Doppler when a focal endometrial abnormality is suspected to characterize vascularity and help distinguish polyps from other lesions [^111yLe7z] [^1112oeUS] [^114kHb2Y].

> Hold on, I should verify when to escalate to saline infusion sonohysterography in premenopausal patients. If the baseline transvaginal ultrasound is inconclusive, if intracavitary pathology such as a polyp or submucosal fibroid is suspected, or if there is persistent bleeding despite negative initial imaging, then sonohysterography is indicated because it is superior to transvaginal ultrasound for detecting and characterizing discrete intrauterine abnormalities and should be timed in the follicular phase after menstrual flow for optimal visualization [^1115jFPM] [^116DFkYK] [^112G1VGH].

> For postmenopausal bleeding, I need to ensure I use transvaginal ultrasound to measure endometrial thickness as the initial test, recognizing that an endometrial thickness of 4 mm or less carries a very high negative predictive value for endometrial cancer and generally obviates biopsy, whereas a thickness greater than 4 mm warrants endometrial sampling, and I should remember that some guidelines allow either ultrasound-first or biopsy-first strategies based on risk and local practice patterns [^115TQ1ND] [^1128Ma2a] [^113ddvfn].

> But wait, what if the ultrasound is technically limited or nondiagnostic. I should double-check whether fibroids, obesity, or patient anatomy are impairing visualization; if so, saline infusion sonohysterography can improve assessment of the endometrial cavity, and if still indeterminate or if malignancy is suspected, contrast-enhanced pelvic MRI is the next appropriate modality for problem-solving and pretreatment planning [^1115jFPM] [^115xx6ac] [^114kHb2Y].

> For adolescents with irregular bleeding, I need to ensure I do not reflexively order ultrasound because most cases reflect an immature hypothalamic–pituitary–ovarian axis; routine pelvic ultrasound is not recommended initially, and imaging should be reserved for those who fail initial medical management, have concerning features, or in whom structural pathology is suspected, in which case transabdominal ultrasound is often used first with transvaginal considered if anatomy and maturity allow [^115YfCr6] [^111sdVDU].

> Let me consider special scenarios so I do not miss important exceptions. If the patient is on tamoxifen or has persistent bleeding, I should maintain a low threshold for endometrial evaluation and consider ultrasound and possible biopsy, and if a focal endometrial lesion is identified, hysteroscopic-directed biopsy is preferred over blind sampling to ensure accurate diagnosis and management planning [^114iqA31] [^117AVD1j].

> I should confirm that endometrial thickness measurement in premenopausal patients is not used to exclude pathology because thickness varies with cycle phase and has poor diagnostic utility, so in reproductive-aged patients I should avoid relying on numeric endometrial thickness cutoffs and instead focus on morphology and targeted imaging or sampling when indicated [^1167vt9e] [^113e2jcp].

> Putting this together, my default order for irregular menstrual bleeding in a nonpregnant adult is transvaginal pelvic ultrasound with Doppler as indicated, with sonohysterography if intracavitary pathology is suspected or the initial study is inconclusive, and MRI reserved for problem-solving when ultrasound is nondiagnostic or malignancy is suspected, while in adolescents I avoid routine ultrasound and reserve imaging for selected cases, and in postmenopausal bleeding I prioritize transvaginal ultrasound to measure endometrial thickness and guide biopsy decisions [^111yLe7z] [^1112oeUS] [^1115jFPM] [^115YfCr6] [^115TQ1ND].

For irregular menstrual bleeding, order a **transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS)** as the first-line imaging test [^111yLe7z] [^114jFkpT] to assess the uterus, endometrium, and ovaries for structural causes such as polyps, fibroids, or endometrial hyperplasia [^113e2jcp]. If TVUS is inconclusive or intrauterine pathology is suspected, add **saline infusion sonohysterography (SIS)** [^1115jFPM] to better define intracavitary lesions [^113okATL]. Use **transabdominal ultrasound** only when TVUS is not feasible (e.g. virginity, severe discomfort) [^113e2jcp]. MRI is reserved for complex cases or when ultrasound is nondiagnostic [^115xx6ac]. In adolescents, avoid routine ultrasound unless bleeding is severe or refractory [^115YfCr6]; in postmenopausal patients, use TVUS to measure endometrial thickness and guide biopsy [^113ddvfn].

---

## Indications for ultrasound in irregular menstrual bleeding

Ultrasound is indicated to identify **structural causes** of irregular bleeding, including:

- **Endometrial polyps**: Benign growths causing irregular or intermenstrual bleeding [^114oa2TY].

- **Uterine fibroids**: Benign tumors causing heavy, prolonged, or irregular bleeding [^116oAjZm].

- **Endometrial hyperplasia**: Thickened endometrium, a precursor to cancer, especially in postmenopausal women [^11483tuV].

- **Adenomyosis**: Endometrial tissue within the myometrium, causing heavy, painful, irregular bleeding [^notfound].

- **Congenital uterine anomalies**: Such as septate uterus or bicornuate uterus, causing irregular bleeding [^notfound].

---

## Recommended ultrasound modalities

### Transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS)

TVUS is the **first-line imaging** modality for irregular menstrual bleeding because it provides detailed visualization of the uterus, endometrium, and ovaries [^111yLe7z] [^114jFkpT]. It is highly sensitive for detecting structural abnormalities such as polyps, fibroids, and endometrial hyperplasia [^116oAjZm] [^113caDqx].

---

### Saline infusion sonohysterography (SIS)

SIS is a specialized ultrasound technique in which sterile saline is infused into the uterine cavity to enhance visualization of intrauterine structures [^112G1VGH]. It is particularly useful for detecting small intrauterine lesions — such as polyps or submucosal fibroids — that may not be clearly visible on standard TVUS [^113okATL] [^116DFkYK].

---

### Transabdominal ultrasound

Transabdominal ultrasound is **less sensitive than TVUS** but may be used when TVUS is not feasible (e.g. patient discomfort, virginity, or severe pelvic pain) [^113e2jcp]. It provides a general overview of pelvic structures but may miss small intrauterine lesions [^notfound].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Several professional organizations provide **guidelines** on the use of ultrasound in evaluating irregular menstrual bleeding:

| **Organization** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) | - TVUS is the initial imaging modality for abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) [^113rVk1g] <br/> - SIS is recommended if TVUS is inconclusive or if intrauterine pathology is suspected [^113okATL] |
| Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada (SOGC) | - TVUS is the first-line imaging for AUB [^114jFkpT] <br/> - SIS is indicated for further characterization of intrauterine abnormalities [^116DFkYK] |
| American College of Radiology (ACR) | - Combined transabdominal and transvaginal ultrasound with Doppler is the most appropriate initial imaging study for AUB [^114kHb2Y] <br/> - SIS is recommended if initial ultrasound is inconclusive [^1115jFPM] |

---

## Limitations and contraindications

While ultrasound is generally safe and well-tolerated, certain **limitations and contraindications** should be considered:

- **Patient discomfort**: TVUS may cause discomfort or anxiety, particularly in virginal patients or those with pelvic pain.

- **Limited visualization**: Severe obesity, uterine fibroids, or patient positioning may limit visualization and necessitate alternative imaging modalities [^114kHb2Y].

- **Contraindications**: Active pelvic infection, severe vaginal stenosis, or patient refusal are contraindications to TVUS or SIS [^112G1VGH].

---

## Alternative imaging modalities

If ultrasound is inconclusive or further characterization is needed, **magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)** is recommended [^115xx6ac]. MRI provides detailed soft-tissue contrast and is particularly useful for evaluating complex uterine anomalies, adenomyosis, or suspected malignancy [^113e2jcp].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **First-line imaging**: Transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) is the initial imaging modality of choice for irregular menstrual bleeding [^111yLe7z].

- **Second-line imaging**: Saline infusion sonohysterography (SIS) is recommended if TVUS is inconclusive or if intrauterine pathology is suspected [^112G1VGH].

- **Adjunctive imaging**: Transabdominal ultrasound may be used if TVUS is not feasible [^113e2jcp].

- **Advanced imaging**: MRI is reserved for complex cases or when ultrasound is inconclusive [^115xx6ac].

---

Transvaginal ultrasound is the **preferred initial imaging** for irregular menstrual bleeding, with SIS as a secondary test when needed. MRI is reserved for complex or inconclusive cases.

This publication summarizes the relevant literature for the imaging of patients with symptoms of abnormal uterine bleeding, including initial imaging, follow-up imaging when the original ultrasound is inconclusive, and follow-up imaging when surveillance is appropriate. For patients with abnormal uterine bleeding, combined transabdominal and transvaginal ultrasound of the pelvis with Doppler is the most appropriate initial imaging study. If the uterus is incompletely visualized with the initial ultrasou2nd, MRI of the pelvis without and with contrast is the next appropriate imaging study, unless a polyp is suspected on the original ultrasound, then sonohysterography can be performed. If the patient continues to experience abnormal uterine bleeding, assessment with ultrasound of the pelvis, sonohysterography, and MRI of the pelvis without and with contrast would be appropriate. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Evaluation of the woman with postmenopausal bleeding: society of radiologists in ultrasound-sponsored consensus conference statement [^113LkP3Y]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Objectives

A panel of 14 physicians practicing medicine in the United States with expertise in radiology, obstetrics and gynecology, gynecologic oncology, hysteroscopy, epidemiology, and pathology was convened by the Society of Radiologists in Ultrasound to discuss the role of sonography in women with postmenopausal bleeding. Broad objectives of this conference were (1) to advance understanding of the utility of different diagnostic techniques for evaluating the endometrium in women with postmenopausal bleeding; (2) to formulate useful and practical guidelines for evaluation of women with postmenopausal bleeding, specifically as it relates to the use of sonography; and (3) to offer suggestions for future research projects.

Setting

October 24 and 25, 2000, Washington, DC, preceding the annual Society of Radiologists in Ultrasound Advances in Sonography conference.

Procedure

Specific questions to the panel included the following: (1) What are the relative effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of using transvaginal sonography versus office (nondirected) endometrial biopsy as the initial examination for a woman with postmenopausal bleeding? (2) What are the sonographic standards for evaluating a woman with postmenopausal bleeding? (3) What are the abnormal sonographic findings in a woman with postmenopausal bleeding? (4) When should saline infusion sonohysterography or hysteroscopy be used in the evaluation of postmenopausal bleeding? (5) Should the diagnostic approach be modified for patients taking hormone replacement medications, tamoxifen, or other selective estrogen receptor modulators?

Conclusions

Consensus recommendations were used to create an algorithm for evaluating women with postmenopausal bleeding. All panelists agreed that because postmenopausal bleeding is the most common presenting symptom of endometrial cancer, when postmenopausal bleeding occurs, clinical evaluation is indicated. The panelists also agreed that either transvaginal sonography or endometrial biopsy could be used safely and effectively as the first diagnostic step. Whether sonography or endometrial biopsy is used initially depends on the physician's assessment of patient risk, the nature of the physician's practice, the availability of high-quality sonography, and patient preference. Similar sensitivities for detecting endometrial carcinoma are reported for transvaginal sonography when an endometrial thickness of greater than 5 mm is considered abnormal and for endometrial biopsy when "sufficient" tissue is obtained. Currently, with respect to mortality, morbidity, and quality-of-life end points, there are insufficient data to comment as to which approach is more effective. The conference concluded by identifying several important unanswered questions and suggestions that could be addressed by future research projects.

### Diagnosis of abnormal uterine bleeding with imaging [^1152E2kC]. Menopause (2011). Low credibility.

The major role of ultrasound in the evaluation of abnormal uterine bleeding, other than that occurring during pregnancy, is in postmenopausal women. Because postmenopausal bleeding can be the presenting symptom of endometrial cancer, any woman with this symptom should be evaluated to diagnose or exclude carcinoma. Over the last two decades, the role of ultrasound in the evaluation of postmenopausal bleeding has changed markedly, from little or no role in 1990 to a major role today. In the intervening years, numerous studies have shown that ultrasound is at least as sensitive as endometrial biopsy for endometrial cancer and that ultrasound can reliably exclude cancer without the need for biopsy in some women with postmenopausal bleeding. In particular, numerous studies have shown that women with an endometrial thickness of 4 mm or less have an extremely low likelihood of endometrial cancer and thus do not need to undergo endometrial biopsy. Ultrasound can also help in the selection of an appropriate biopsy technique. In a woman with postmenopausal bleeding and a thick endometrium, a sonohysterogram can determine whether the endometrium is diffusely thick or has focal areas of thickening. With diffuse thickening, a blind endometrial biopsy is appropriate. When there are one or more focal areas of thickening, hysteroscopic biopsy is likely to be the better choice. We present two clinical algorithms, either of which is an acceptable approach to the use of ultrasound and/or endometrial biopsy in women with postmenopausal bleeding: the "ultrasound-first" approach and the "biopsy-first" approach.

Abnormal uterine bleeding is an important clinical concern and accounts for much medical intervention. This article presents an ultrasound-based approach to help exclude endometrial carcinoma and identify the source of bleeding for better clinical management. Saline infusion sonohysterography can help to triage patients to (1) no anatomic pathology, (2) globally thickened anatomic pathology that may be evaluated with blind endometrial sampling, or (3) focal abnormalities that must be evaluated under direct vision.

Early (dating) ultrasound — The Work Group advises a first-trimester ultrasound to establish or confirm the gestational age and estimated birth date and to confirm the presence of cardiac activity; for pregnant patients who present after the first trimester, we advise performing a dating and anatomical ultrasound at the earliest opportunity, preferably before 22 weeks. The estimated due date is initially established by calculating 280 days from the first day of the last normal menstrual period, but only about 50% of patients accurately recall the date of the last menstrual period and menstrual cycles might be shorter or longer than 28 days, supporting ultrasound confirmation. Beyond dating, early ultrasound indications include evaluation of vaginal bleeding, confirmation of an intrauterine location, presence and chronicity of multiple gestations, presence of uterine anomalies, or presence of other pelvic pathology, and patients with complaints of bleeding or pain should be referred for immediate ultrasound on presentation.

### Diagnosis of abnormal uterine bleeding with biopsy or hysteroscopy [^114vd7mk]. Menopause (2011). Low credibility.

Abnormal uterine bleeding in women is a common cause for gynecologic consultation. Physicians must maintain a low threshold for endometrial assessment in abnormal uterine bleeding. Accurately determining the etiology of the bleeding permits appropriate treatment, minimizes unnecessary delays in therapy, and prevents needless worry in women. There are few national consensus guidelines, best practice guidelines, or treatment algorithms that provide gynecologists with scrupulous data to make concise decisions for the utilization of technology such as endometrial biopsy, transvaginal ultrasound, saline infusion sonography, or hysteroscopy in the evaluation of menstrual aberrations. Using technology that has a high sensitivity to detect a disease allows a physician to make concise decisions for proceeding with minimally invasive procedures or reliance on medical therapies that will probably be effective.

### Management of pre-, peri-, and post-menopausal abnormal uterine bleeding: when to perform endometrial sampling? [^113KNAgg]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) is defined as abnormal volume, duration, or frequency of menstrual period and is a common symptom in women of all ages (premenopausal, perimenopausal, and postmenopausal). The acronym PALM-COEIN, introduced by the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO), facilitates the evaluation and differential diagnosis of AUB, mostly in premenopausal women with AUB. Endometrial evaluation (including ultrasound or hysteroscopic imaging and tissue sampling) for subtle pathology is proposed in patients who are at high risk for endometrial cancer and in patients at low risk who present with AUB and who present poor correspondence in medical treatment. Many new diagnostic modalities are available in clinicians in order to help the assessment of women presenting with abnormalities in their menstrual pattern. The present study reviews the optimal management of women presenting with AUB, taking into consideration the actual need for invasive management in these women, who of them require it, and who can be diagnosed without histological verification. The importance of endometrial tissue sampling in women who present with AUB as well as the best timing for a clinician to conduct a biopsy are two axons analyzed below, according to the latest worldwide guidelines and major publications about this subject.

### ACOG committee opinion no. 426: the role of transvaginal ultrasonography in the evaluation of postmenopausal bleeding [^113ddvfn]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2009). Low credibility.

The clinical approach to postmenopausal bleeding requires prompt and efficient evaluation to exclude or diagnose carcinoma. Women with postmenopausal bleeding may be assessed initially with either endometrial biopsy or transvaginal ultrasonography; this initial evaluation does not require performance of both tests. Transvaginal ultrasonography can be useful in the triage of patients in whom endometrial sampling was performed but tissue was insufficient for diagnosis. When transvaginal ultrasonography is performed for patients with postmenopausal bleeding and an endometrial thickness of less than or equal to 4 mm is found, endometrial sampling is not required. Meaningful assessment of the endometrium by ultrasonography is not possible in all patients. In such cases, alternative assessment should be completed. When bleeding persists despite negative initial evaluations, additional assessment usually is indicated.

### Ultrasonographic evaluation of the endometrium in postmenopausal vaginal bleeding [^11483tuV]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Transvaginal ultrasound with SIS is a cost-minimizing screening tool for perimenopausal and postmenopausal women with vaginal bleeding. Its use decreases the need for invasive diagnostic procedures for women without abnormalities, and ultrasound increases the sensitivity of detecting abnormalities in women with pathologic conditions. Vaginal sonography is preferred over uniform biopsy of postmenopausal women with vaginal bleeding because it (1) is a less invasive procedure, (2) is generally painless, (3) has no complications, and (4) may be more sensitive for detecting carcinoma than blind biopsy. Transvaginal sonography is rarely nondiagnostic. Endometrial sampling is less successful in women with a thin endometrial stripe on ultrasound than in women with real endometrial pathologic condition. A limitation of ultrasound is that an abnormal finding is not specific: ultrasound cannot always reliably distinguish between benign proliferation, hyperplasia, polyps, and cancer. Although ultrasound may not be able to distinguish between hyperplasia and malignancy, the next step in the clinical treatment requires tissue sampling. Because of the risk of progression of complex hyperplasia to carcinoma, patients with this finding may benefit from hormonal suppression, dilatation and curettage, endometrial ablation, or hysterectomy, depending on the clinical scenario. The inability to distinguish these two entities based on ultrasound alone should not be seen as a limitation because tissue sampling is required in either case. Occasionally (in 5% to 10% of cases), a woman's endometrium cannot be identified on ultrasound, and these women also need further evaluation. Ultrasonography also may be used as a first-line investigation in other populations with abnormal uterine bleeding. In a multicenter, randomized, controlled trial of 400 women with abnormal uterine bleeding, the investigators found that transvaginal sonography combined with Pipelle endometrial biopsy and outpatient hysteroscopy was as effective as inpatient hysteroscopy and curettage. The subject, included women older than 35 years with PMB, menorrhagia, intermenstrual bleeding, postcoital bleeding, or irregular menses. Transvaginal sonography may be a cost-effective. sensitive, and well-tolerated method to evaluate most women with abnormal bleeding in combination with physical examination and endometrial biopsy and hysteroscopy us indicated. Hysteroscopy is likely to become the new gold standard in the future because of its ability to visualize directly the endometrium and perform directed biopsies as indicated. As office-based hysteroscopy becomes more practical and widespread, the technique may become more cost effective. An evaluation plan using transvaginal sonography as the initial screening evaluation followed by endometrial biopsy or, more likely, hysteroscopy is likely to become the standard of care (Fig. 12). It remains unproven whether certain patients at higher risk for carcinoma should proceed directly to invasive evaluation. Women on tamoxifen with persistent recurrent bleeding, women with significant risk factors for carcinoma, and women with life-threatening hemorrhage comprise this group. Further studies are still necessary to evaluate high-risk patients and determine whether ultrasound or biopsy is really the most cost-effective initial test.

### ACOG committee opinion no. 734: the role of transvaginal ultrasonography in evaluating the endometrium of women with postmenopausal bleeding [^115TQ1ND]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Low credibility.

Cancer of the endometrium is the most common type of gynecologic cancer in the United States. Vaginal bleeding is the presenting sign in more than 90% of postmenopausal women with endometrial carcinoma. Clinical risk factors for endometrial cancer, including but not limited to age, obesity, use of unopposed estrogen, specific medical comorbidities (eg, polycystic ovary syndrome, type 2 diabetes mellitus, atypical glandular cells on screening cervical cytology), and family history of gynecologic malignancy also should be considered when evaluating postmenopausal bleeding. The clinical approach to postmenopausal bleeding requires prompt and efficient evaluation to exclude or diagnose endometrial carcinoma and endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia. Transvaginal ultrasonography usually is sufficient for an initial evaluation of postmenopausal bleeding if the ultrasound images reveal a thin endometrial echo (less than or equal to 4 mm), given that an endometrial thickness of 4 mm or less has a greater than 99% negative predictive value for endometrial cancer. Transvaginal ultrasonography is a reasonable alternative to endometrial sampling as a first approach in evaluating a postmenopausal woman with an initial episode of bleeding. If blind sampling does not reveal endometrial hyperplasia or malignancy, further testing, such as hysteroscopy with dilation and curettage, is warranted in the evaluation of women with persistent or recurrent bleeding. An endometrial measurement greater than 4 mm that is incidentally discovered in a postmenopausal patient without bleeding need not routinely trigger evaluation, although an individualized assessment based on patient characteristics and risk factors is appropriate. Transvaginal ultrasonography is not an appropriate screening tool for endometrial cancer in postmenopausal women without bleeding.

### Contemporary evaluation of women and girls with abnormal uterine bleeding: FIGO systems 1 and 2 [^115YrwWW]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2023). Medium credibility.

8 FINAL THOUGHTS

Abnormal uterine bleeding and its associated conditions (e.g. ID and IDA) are underrecognized and underreported. By utilizing FIGO System 1, information about menstrual cycles and bleeding patterns can be gathered in a concise and straightforward manner. This provides the gateway to a complete evaluation with appropriate investigations and allows for a diagnosis comprising one or more elements in FIGO System 2. Menstruation and menstrual cycle symptoms can provide valuable insights into the overall health of women and girls. To date, there has been insufficient attention to inquiry about menstruation and menstrual cycle symptoms. Therefore, a conscious effort to include questions surrounding menstrual health, mirroring FIGO Systems 1 and 2, as well as signs and symptoms of associated ID/IDA, in all clinical trials, including women and girls of reproductive age, could significantly improve detection and onward management of these debilitating conditions.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® on abnormal vaginal bleeding [^113e2jcp]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2011). Low credibility.

In evaluating a woman with abnormal vaginal bleeding, imaging cannot replace definitive histologic diagnosis but often plays an important role in screening, characterization of structural abnormalities, and directing appropriate patient care. Transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) is generally the initial imaging modality of choice, with endometrial thickness a well-established predictor of endometrial disease in postmenopausal women. Endometrial thickness measurements of ≤ 5 mm and ≤ 4 mm have been advocated as appropriate upper threshold values to reasonably exclude endometrial carcinoma in postmenopausal women with vaginal bleeding; however, the best upper threshold endometrial thickness in the asymptomatic postmenopausal patient remains a subject of debate. Endometrial thickness in a premenopausal patient is a less reliable indicator of endometrial pathology since this may vary widely depending on the phase of menstrual cycle, and an upper threshold value for normal has not been well-established. Transabdominal ultrasound is generally an adjunct to TVUS and is most helpful when TVUS is not feasible or there is poor visualization of the endometrium. Hysterosonography may also allow for better delineation of both the endometrium and focal abnormalities in the endometrial cavity, leading to hysteroscopically directed biopsy or resection. Color and pulsed Doppler may provide additional characterization of a focal endometrial abnormality by demonstrating vascularity. MRI may also serve as an important problem-solving tool if the endometrium cannot be visualized on TVUS and hysterosonography is not possible, as well as for pretreatment planning of patients with suspected endometrial carcinoma. CT is generally not warranted for the evaluation of patients with abnormal bleeding, and an abnormal endometrium incidentally detected on CT should be further evaluated with TVUS.

### US of abnormal uterine bleeding [^113eNsGS]. Radiographics (2003). Low credibility.

Any significant deviation from a woman's established menstrual pattern may be considered abnormal uterine bleeding, and several factors direct evaluation of a patient with such bleeding. Premenopausal disorders that are well evaluated with ultrasound (US) include endometriosis, adenomyosis, and leiomyomas. A positive pregnancy test in a woman of childbearing age prompts a search for an intrauterine pregnancy. Possible complications that may contribute to bleeding include ectopic pregnancy; placental factors including position, trauma, and infection; gestational trophoblastic disease; preterm labor; and postpartum complications. Atrophic changes, hormonal status, and carcinoma are considerations in the postmenopausal patient with abnormal uterine bleeding. Foreign bodies, trauma, infection, polyps, and iatrogenic causes can be observed in all groups. Differential diagnoses for abnormal uterine bleeding in premenopausal, pregnant, and postmenopausal patients are well evaluated with US, and US techniques have greatly facilitated evaluation of pelvic disease. Urgent and emergent conditions such as ectopic pregnancy, placenta previa, and preterm labor are readily identifiable.

### The FIGO ovulatory disorders classification system [^112kx7a3]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2022). Medium credibility.

A somewhat similar experience exists at the opposite end of the reproductive age spectrum, beyond the age of 45 years, as women enter what has been called the menopausal transition, where cycle length typically becomes more infrequent or irregular before culminating in amenorrhea as ovarian secretion of estradiol declines and ultimately ceases. However, this experience is perhaps even less orderly than that of the post‐menarcheal period, as there may be highly variable endocrine changes resulting in unpredictable impacts on menstrual function. Again, what is common, and often portrayed as "normal", can be highly disruptive, particularly when coupled with other symptoms.

Women who present with infertility may have accompanying menstrual symptoms typical of ovulatory disorders. However, women with cyclically normal onset of menstrual bleeding may not be ovulating, or at least not ovulating regularly, as the frequency of single‐cycle anovulation in the context of normal regular cycles is in the range of 3.7%–26.7%. Consequently, further evaluation beyond a detailed history will be necessary to identify those with ovulatory disorders.

The optimal way to assess for ovulation and, by extension, confirm ovulatory disorders may vary according to the clinical circumstance. The menstrual history of regular, predictable cycles between 24 and 38 days remains a helpful tool, and reflects the overall experience better than evaluation of endocrine or imaging parameters from a single cycle does. While patients and clinicians have traditionally used measurement of basal body temperature, interpretation can be difficult, so this approach should be used with caution. If available, ovulation predictor kits that measure the levels of luteinizing hormone in urine samples generally accurately reflect levels of serum luteinizing hormone and are a valuable tool for detecting ovulation in a given cycle. Simply measuring progesterone in the predicted luteal phase may provide satisfactory evidence supporting ovulatory function, particularly when the first day of the next menstrual period is known. Such an approach may be helpful in circumstances such as hirsutism, where the incidence of anovulation in women with cyclically predictable menstrual cycles is higher.

There are other, less common ovulatory disorders that may require more complex evaluation to determine if they are present in a given individual. For example, identifying LUF cycles, somewhat common in infertile women, requires both confirmation of the LH surge and the performance of serial ultrasound to demonstrate failed rupture of the dominant follicle. It should be remembered that scrutiny of a single cycle may not reflect the overall experience for a given individual.

3 THE VALUE OF THE TWOSYSTEMS

3.1 Characterization and classification

Inconsistent terminology related to AUB was — and still is — pervasive in clinical care and the design and interpretation of basic, translational, clinical, and epidemiological research. This circumstance adversely affects the construct and interpretation of systematic reviews and meta‐analyses and, in turn, has a negative effect on clinical care, patient education and counseling, and the training of medical students, residents or registrars, and those in other postgraduate programs.

To systemize how women with AUB are evaluated, the vital step of improving and standardizing terminology used within the field was undertaken by FIGO after an extensive multistage process. International consensus using a Delphi process was sought from 2005 onward, leading to the creation of the two FIGO systems for the assessment and classification of AUB. By standardizing the descriptions of normal and abnormal menstrual function and the classification of causes of nongestational AUB in the reproductive years, communication regarding nongestational AUB can improve. Standardization fosters the creation of more homogenous populations with similar clinical features and functional and structural causes of AUB in a fashion that enhances the design and interpretation of research, facilitates education, and allows for more evidence‐based and consistent counseling of affected women regarding appropriate options.

Nongestational AUB in the reproductive years can be either acute or chronic. Chronic AUB is defined by FIGO as: "bleeding from the uterine corpus that is abnormal in volume, regularity, and/or timing, and has been present for the majority of the past 6 months". In contrast, acute AUB is: "an episode of heavy bleeding that, in the opinion of the clinician, is of sufficient quantity to require immediate intervention to prevent further blood loss".

The structured approach to diagnosis embodied in FIGO AUB Systems 1 and 2 applies to both acute and chronic AUB; however, when acute, the clinician must act expeditiously to stem the bleeding, often before a complete evaluation is possible. With both acute and chronic AUB, it is also important to remember the concurrent effect on the body's iron stores, the risk of ID and IDA, and the potential and related impacts on the patient's overall health and quality of life. It is, therefore, essential to investigate iron stores and the possibility of IDA alongside the AUB evaluation and process as guided by FIGO Systems 1 and 2.

### Abnormal uterine bleeding: imaging techniques for evaluation of the uterine cavity and endometrium before minimally invasive surgery – the case for transvaginal ultrasonography [^117W6P2A]. Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology (2007). Low credibility.

Transvaginal ultrasound has been utilized for first line evaluation of abnormal uterine bleeding since its development in the early 1980's. The benefits and diagnostic effectiveness of transvaginal ultrasound in assessing the uterus, unlike hysteroscopy, extends to the complete pelvis. The ease of application, patient acceptance, and immediacy of results are rapidly apparent. Comparisons with hysteroscopic evaluation are discussed. While tissue diagnosis is still the gold standard, transvaginal sonography lets one know what surgical procedure to plan for from hysteroscopy to Endoscopy or laparotomy, including when no further surgical evaluation is necessary.

### Evaluation and management of heavy vaginal bleeding (noncancerous) [^115ewNa5]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Heavy vaginal bleeding is a common, life-altering condition affecting around 30% of women at some point in their reproductive lives. Initial evaluation should focus on hemodynamic stability. A thorough history including the patient's menstrual cycle and personal and family bleeding history should be obtained. Causes are stratified using the structural and nonstructural International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics classification system. Further consideration of the patient's age is essential because this can help to narrow the differential diagnosis. Work-up includes laboratory and imaging studies. Treatment approach includes acute stabilization and long-term treatment with medical and surgical modalities.

### Performance of ultrasound and rates of guideline-concordant care in a diverse postmenopausal bleeding cohort [^115mMxLU]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Professional society guidelines endorse the use of ultrasound to evaluate an initial episode of postmenopausal bleeding, with endometrial sampling reserved for patients with an endometrial thickness exceeding 4 mm. However, the data supporting this ultrasound-based approach are derived from cohort studies with minimal racial and ethnic diversity.

Objective(S)

We aimed to evaluate rates of adequate endometrial visualization and prompt guideline-concordant care and to identify risk factors for lack of timely indicated sampling in a multi-institutional cohort of patients who underwent ultrasound to evaluate postmenopausal bleeding.

Study Design

Patients aged ≥ 45 years who underwent transvaginal ultrasound for an initial coding-based diagnosis of postmenopausal bleeding were eligible for this retrospective cohort study. Ultrasound findings of the endometrium were classified as thin (endometrium ≤ 4 mm), thick (endometrium > 4 mm), or inadequate (endometrium not completely visualized). Associations between clinicodemographic factors, ultrasound findings and follow-up patterns were analyzed. We defined guideline-concordant care as either having a thin endometrium or receiving indicated endometrial sampling within 3 months after index ultrasound. We analyzed outcomes using univariable and multivariable logistic regressions.

Results

3614 patients were included in the study (48.4% non-Hispanic White, 28.5% non-Hispanic Black, 9.6% Hispanic, 3.0% Asian, 10.4% other/missing). Rates of inadequate ultrasound varied between racial/ethnic cohorts (non-Hispanic White 5.9%, non-Hispanic Black 18.8%, Hispanic 12.7%, Asian 9.2%). Uterine fibroids were present in 71.5% (737/1031) non-Hispanic Black compared to 43.3% (757/1750) non-Hispanic White patients and were strongly associated with lower odds of adequate ultrasound (OR 0.29 [95% CI 0.23–0.38] p < 0.001). Rates of endometrial sampling were 53.5% (209/391) after an inadequate ultrasound and 75.3% (1329/1765) after a thickened endometrium. Guideline-concordant care rates were 85.7% for non-Hispanic White (1500/1750), 78.0% non-Hispanic Black (804/1031), 83.6% Hispanic (290/347), and 82.7% Other/Unknown (402/83). Compared to non-Hispanic White patients, non-Hispanic Black patients were less likely to receive guideline-concordant care (aOR 0.64 [95% CI 0.52–0.78]).

Conclusion(S)

Non-Hispanic Black patients with postmenopausal bleeding have a higher rate of inadequate ultrasound due to fibroids and are less likely to receive prompt guideline-concordant care. An ultrasound-based work-up of postmenopausal bleeding risks delays in endometrial cancer diagnoses and may contribute to racial disparities in outcomes. A universal biopsy approach for postmenopausal bleeding may be considered to decrease variation in, and improve, guideline-concordant care.

### Abnormal uterine bleeding [^115B7EjJ]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Abnormal uterine bleeding is a common presenting symptom in the family practice setting. In women of childbearing age, a methodical history, physical examination, and laboratory evaluation may enable the physician to rule out causes such as pregnancy and pregnancy-related disorders, medications, iatrogenic causes, systemic conditions, and obvious genital tract pathology. Dysfunctional uterine bleeding (anovulatory or ovulatory) is diagnosed by exclusion of these causes. In women of childbearing age who are at high risk for endometrial cancer, the initial evaluation includes endometrial biopsy; saline-infusion sonohysterography or diagnostic hysteroscopy is performed if initial studies are inconclusive or the bleeding continues. Women of childbearing age who are at low risk for endometrial cancer may be assessed initially by transvaginal ultrasonography. Postmenopausal women with abnormal uterine bleeding should be offered dilatation and curettage; if they are poor candidates for general anesthesia or decline dilatation and curettage, they may be offered transvaginal ultrasonography or saline-infusion sonohysterography with directed endometrial biopsy. Medical management of anovulatory dysfunctional uterine bleeding may include oral contraceptive pills or cyclic progestins. Menorrhagia is managed most effectively with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or the levonorgestrel intrauterine contraceptive device. Surgical management may include hysterectomy or less invasive, uterus-sparing procedures.

1 INTRODUCTION

1.1 Menstruation and abnormal uterine bleeding

Nongestational abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) in the reproductive years usually originates in the endometrium, regardless of the primary cause. Abnormal uterine bleeding is an umbrella termthat includes heavy (HMB), irregular, and intermenstrual bleeding (IMB), as well as disorders of cycle length — those more or less frequent than the normal range of 24–38 days. Understanding the physiology of normal endometrial function aids understanding of why the causes of AUB lead to altered endometrial behavior (i.e. one of altered bleeding characteristics) and provides a guide to interpreting investigational findings in a fashion that facilitates the creation of a personalized menu of therapeutic options.

Almost half of the world's human population will menstruateand during their reproductive years, it has been estimated that at least one in three women will experience AUB. However, recent questionnaire‐based surveys have found that HMB alone may be prevalent in over 50% of women of reproductive age. This would suggest that the lifetime risk estimation of AUB affecting one in three women is likely to be a gross underestimation. For decades, it has been reported that women experience many barriers to receiving care for AUB. This may account for the discrepancies in "patient data"‐based studies that suggest the one in three lifetime risk of AUB, whereas "direct‐to‐patient" studies suggest the much higher point prevalence of over 50% for HMB alone.

Endometrial hyperplasia, polyps, and cancer — patients who are receiving or have received tamoxifen and who retain their uterus should undergo annual gynecologic exams. Any change in menstrual bleeding and any postmenopausal vaginal bleeding should prompt a gynecologic evaluation, uterine ultrasound, and possible endometrial biopsy. In the absence of bleeding change or abnormalities, there is no role for routine ultrasound or endometrial biopsies to monitor the endometrium.

4 SYSTEM 1

4.1 Normal and abnormal uterine bleeding definitions and terminology

FIGO System 1 was developed to formalize the nomenclature and definitions of normal and abnormal menstrual bleeding, allowing clinicians, investigators, and patients to align on the description of the bleeding patterns of those complaining of AUB (Figure 1). Each element is considered in the context of a structured history and defines normal and, therefore, abnormal features generally based on the fifth to 95th percentiles from large‐scale clinical studies. System 1 was the product of a rigorous Delphi process that was used to develop simple and translatable definitions while identifying and removing the need for obsolete terminologies such as menorrhagia, menometrorrhagia, and dysfunctional uterine bleeding.

FIGURE 1
FIGO Abnormal Uterine Bleeding (AUB) System 1, defining the nomenclature and definition of AUB (30). *The normal range is age dependent, with shortest to longest days for 18–25 years at ≤ 9 days, 26–41 years at ≤ 7 days, and 42–45 years at ≤ 9 days.

As seen in Figure 1, application of FIGO System 1 in a clinical scenario requires a structured history that allows a description of the four parameters of frequency, duration, regularity, and subjective flow volume, as well as the presence or absence of IMB and unscheduled bleeding for those on progestin‐based gonadal steroid formulations. Of course, cyclical administration of estrogen and progestin‐containing agents, typically for contraception, is expected to result in cyclical withdrawal bleeding from the endometrium. All the metrics are based on the previous 6 months, provided there has been no pregnancy or puerperium.

Frequency

The number of days in an average menstrual cycle from the first day of bleeding in one cycle to the first day of the next cycle. The normal length of a menstrual cycle ranges from 24 to 38 days, whereas abnormal frequency of menstruation is less than 24 days (frequent menses) or more than 38 days (infrequent menses). The absence of menstrual bleeding, without an iatrogenic cause, should be characterized as amenorrhea, as this too is abnormal.

Duration

The number of consecutive bleeding days in each cycle, where the count begins with the onset of bleeding and ends on the last day of blood flow, including the light bleeding, often called spotting. It is normal for women to bleed for up to eight consecutive days, whereas longer than this would be considered prolonged and abnormal.

### Recommendations from the 2023 international evidence-based guideline for the assessment and management of polycystic ovary syndrome [^111bmTa8]. European Journal of Endocrinology (2023). High credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome — ultrasound assessment and PCOM thresholds in adults and adolescents specify that follicle number per ovary (FNPO) ≥ 20 in at least one ovary should be considered the threshold for PCOM in adults, and when older technology or limited image quality is used, ovarian volume (OV) ≥ 10 mL or follicle number per section (FNPS) ≥ 10 in at least one ovary in adults should be considered the threshold. There are no definitive criteria to define polycystic ovary morphology (PCOM) on ultrasound in adolescents, hence it is not recommended in adolescents. When an ultrasound is indicated, if acceptable to the individual, the transvaginal approach is the most accurate for the diagnosis of PCOM, while transabdominal ultrasound should primarily report OV with a threshold of ≥ 10 mL or FNPS ≥ 10 in either ovary in adults. In patients with irregular menstrual cycles and hyperandrogenism, an ovarian ultrasound is not necessary for PCOS diagnosis. Thresholds for PCOM should be revised regularly with advancing ultrasound technology, and age-specific cut-off values for PCOM should be defined. Training and standardized protocols are recommended for PCOM reporting on ultrasound, including at a minimum documentation of the last menstrual period or stage of cycle, transducer bandwidth frequency, approach/route, total number per 2–9 mm follicles per ovary, measurements in three dimensions (in cm) or volume of each ovary, other ovarian features and/or pathology including dominant follicles (≥ 10 mm) which should not be included in ovarian volume calculations, reliance on the contralateral ovary FNPO where a dominant follicle is noted, and uterine features including endometrial thickness and pattern.

### Clinical signs and diagnosis of fibroids from adolescence to menopause [^116oAjZm]. Fertility and Sterility (2024). Medium credibility.

The aim of this review was to provide an updated assessment of the present diagnostic tools and clinical symptoms and signs to evaluate uterine fibroids (UFs) on the basis of current guidelines, recent scientific evidence, and a PubMed and Google Scholar search for peer-reviewed original and review articles related to clinical signs and diagnosis of UFs. Approximately 50%-75% of UFs are considered nonclinically relevant. When present, the most common symptoms are abnormal uterine bleeding, pelvic pain and/or bulk symptoms, and reproductive failure. Transvaginal ultrasound is recommended as the initial diagnostic modality because of its accessibility and high sensitivity, although magnetic resonance imaging appears to be the most accurate diagnostic tool to date in certain cases. Other emerging techniques, such as saline infusion sonohysterography, elastography, and contrast-enhanced ultrasonography, may contribute to improving diagnostic accuracy in selected cases. Moreover, artificial intelligence has begun to demonstrate its ability as a complementary tool to improve the efficiency of UF diagnosis. Therefore, it is critical to standardize descriptions of transvaginal ultrasound images according to updated classifications and to individualize the use of the different complementary diagnostic tools available to achieve precise uterine mapping that can lead to targeted therapeutic approaches according to the clinical context of each patient.

### Consider ultrasound first for imaging the female pelvis [^1159ijjp]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2015). Low credibility.

Ultrasound technology has evolved dramatically in recent years and now includes applications such as 3-dimensional volume imaging, real-time evaluation of pelvic organs (simultaneous with the physical examination), and Doppler blood flow mapping without the need for contrast, which makes ultrasound imaging unique for imaging the female pelvis. Among the many cross-sectional imaging techniques, we should use the most informative, less invasive, and less expensive modality to avoid radiation when possible. Hence, ultrasound imaging should be the first imaging modality used in women with pelvic symptoms.

Ovulatory dysfunction

Ovulatory disorders exist on a spectrum (Figure 4) that encompasses occasional delayed or failed ovulation to a chronic process that can cause amenorrhea or manifest with bleeding that varies in volume, duration, and frequency.

FIGURE 4
Typically, but not always, these disorders manifest abnormalities in FIGO System 1 parameters that describe menstrual bleeding pattern: frequency, regularity, duration and volume of bleeding.

Whereas the diagnosis of AUB‐O is generally suggested by a history of irregular bleeding obtained via FIGO's AUB System 1, the specific cause of the ovulatory disorder requires a structured evaluation. While ovulatory status can usually be suggested from FIGO System 1, when there is a lack of clarity other measures may be employed, including daily measurement of basal body temperature or obtaining serum progesterone in the suspected luteal phase of the cycle.

Recently, a classification system for ovulatory disorders was developed under the aegis of FIGO by the Committees for Menstrual Disorders and Related Health Impacts (formerly the Menstrual Disorders Committee) and Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility. The development involved journal editors, recognized experts, and national, subspecialty, and lay societies from around the world to achieve international consensus for replacing a system developed over 50 years ago by the WHO. The new system comprises three anatomic categories, as well as a separate category for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), which are recognized in the acronym "HyPO‐P": Type 1 (Hypothalamic); Type 2 (Pituitary); Type 3 (Ovarian); and Type 4 (Polycystic Ovary Syndrome) (Figure 5). Each of the three anatomic categories includes a list of subtypes that follow the acronym GAIN‐FIT‐PIE (Genetic, Autoimmune, Iatrogenic, Neoplasm, Functional, Infectious and Inflammatory, Trauma, and Vascular; Physiological, Idiopathic, Endocrine) reflecting the various possible mechanisms within a given anatomical location. The investigational pathway for an individual with an ovulatory disorder is dependent upon a number of factors, including age, reproductive goals, and the suspected causes based on the initial evaluation.

FIGURE 5
The proposed FIGO classification system for ovulatory disorders. This system allows for an initial allocation of presumed primary source of ovulatory dysfunction (i.e. hypothalamus, pituitary gland, or ovary). Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is defined separately and the WHO classification system for the same should be adopted. After anatomical allocation, known or presumed mechanism is classified according to the GAIN‐FIT‐PIE acronym, as appropriate and applicable.

### Current evaluation of amenorrhea: a committee opinion [^1158P3GC]. Fertility and Sterility (2024). High credibility.

Amenorrhea evaluation — progesterone withdrawal test (PWT): The foundation of this test centers on the understanding that although low E2 and high gonadotropin levels are informative of ovarian insufficiency, normal E2 levels (in the range that is deemed normal for early follicular phase) and normal gonadotropins are relatively poor discriminants of the many nonovarian causes of amenorrhea; interpretation of a failed response (i.e., no bleeding) to PWT can be twofold, secondary to a hypoestrogenic milieu or because of an inability of the endometrium to respond to an estrogen replete environment, and in FHA circulating E2 is suppressed (< 30 pg/mL) with the endometrium often quiescent; ultrasound findings of endometrial thickness can help guide decisions regarding proceeding with PWT, and the absence of withdrawal bleeding with a progestin challenge is predictable if ultrasound demonstrates an attenuated endometrium.

### The two FIGO systems for normal and abnormal uterine bleeding symptoms and classification of causes of abnormal uterine bleeding in the reproductive years: 2018 revisions [^115L1hCU]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) systems for nomenclature of symptoms of normal and abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) in the reproductive years (FIGO AUB System 1) and for classification of causes of AUB (FIGO AUB System 2; PALM-COEIN) were first published together in 2011. The purpose was to harmonize the definitions of normal and abnormal bleeding symptoms and to classify and subclassify underlying potential causes of AUB in the reproductive years to facilitate research, education, and clinical care. The systems were designed to be flexible and to be periodically reviewed and modified as appropriate.

Objectives

To review, clarify, and, where appropriate, revise the previously published systems.

Methodology and Outcome

To a large extent, the process has been an iterative one involving the FIGO Menstrual Disorders Committee, as well as a number of invited contributions from epidemiologists, gynecologists, and other experts in the field from around the world between 2012 and 2017. Face-to-face meetings have been held in Rome, Vancouver, and Singapore, and have been augmented by a number of teleconferences and other communications designed to evaluate various aspects of the systems. Where substantial change was considered, anonymous voting, in some instances using a modified RAND Delphi technique, was utilized.

### Ultrasound assessment of premenopausal bleeding [^112JZyLc]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Vaginal bleeding is the most common cause of emergency care in the first trimester of pregnancy and accounts for the majority of premenopausal bleeding cases. Ultrasound evaluation combined with a quantitative beta human chorionic gonadotropin test is an established diagnostic tool to assess these patients. Spontaneous abortion because of genetic abnormalities is the most common cause of vaginal bleeding; ectopic pregnancy and gestational trophoblastic disease are other important causes and in all patients presenting with first trimester bleeding, ectopic pregnancy should be suspected and excluded, as it is associated with significant maternal morbidity and mortality. A thorough knowledge of the normal sonographic appearance of intrauterine gestation is essential to understand the manifestations of an abnormal gestation. Arteriovenous malformation of the uterus is a rare but important cause of vaginal bleeding in the first trimester, as it has to be differentiated from the more common retained products of conception, with which it is often mistaken.

### Functional hypothalamic amenorrhea: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^114oa2TY]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2017). Medium credibility.

Primary amenorrhea — evaluation for Müllerian tract anomalies: In cases of primary amenorrhea, we suggest evaluating Müllerian tract anomalies (congenital or acquired) and note that diagnostic options include physical examination, progestin challenge test, abdominal or transvaginal ultrasound, and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), depending on the context and patient preferences (2⊕⊕○○). Defining reproductive tract anatomies is described as the first step in excluding anatomic causes of amenorrhea and is especially important in primary amenorrhea; outflow tract anomalies often present as primary amenorrhea and require both a physical examination and imaging with pelvic ultrasound or MRI to exclude and/or define anatomic anomalies. In some women with functional hypothalamic amenorrhea (FHA), clinicians may consider a hysterosalpingogram, sonohysterogram, or saline infusion sonogram or hysteroscopy to establish acquired gynecologic tract abnormalities, and the text notes that Asherman syndrome may present as secondary amenorrhea, that a history of postpartum dilation and curettage or pelvic infection may raise suspicion of endometrial injury, and that irregular and erratic bleeding may be due to intrauterine polyps or intramural fibroids rather than functional hypothalamic hypogonadism.

### Predicting the risk of endometrial cancer in postmenopausal women presenting with vaginal bleeding: the norwich DEFAB risk assessment tool [^116V6iWm]. British Journal of Cancer (2010). Low credibility.

Postmenopausal bleeding refers to any genital tract bleeding in a postmenopausal woman, other than the expected bleeding that occurs in women taking sequential hormone replacement therapy (HRT). Because postmenopausal bleeding is the most common symptom of endometrial cancer, when postmenopausal bleeding occurs, clinical evaluation is indicated. Approximately 10% (range 1–25%) of women presenting with postmenopausal bleeding will be diagnosed with endometrial carcinoma. Endometrial atrophy is the most common cause of genital tract bleeding among postmenopausal women. Endometrial hyperplasia and polyps are also common causes.

Two different forms of endometrial carcinoma have been identified. Type-I cancers have an endometrioid histology and account for 70–80% of endometrial carcinomas. They are associated with unopposed oestrogen stimulation of the endometrium and tend to arise in women with obesity, hyperlipidaemia, and other hyper-oestrogenic conditions. Type-II cancers have a non-endometrioid histology and arise in women who are less likely to have the clinical associations seen in type-I cancers. Several risk factors such as obesity, tamoxifen use, increasing age, hypertension, diabetes, and unopposed use of exogenous oestrogens are strongly associated with increased risk of type-I endometrial cancer. Early menarche and late menopause have also been implicated due to prolonged oestrogen stimulation of the endometrium. Nulliparity as an isolated risk factor does not appear to increase the risk of endometrial cancer, although due to the high frequency of anovulatory cycles there may be an association in women with subfertility. Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer is a significant but rare risk factor, with descendants of an affected family member carrying a theoretical 50% lifetime risk of endometrial cancer.

Currently, controversy exists as to whether transvaginal ultrasonography or endometrial biopsy should be used as the initial diagnostic step for clinical evaluation of women presenting with postmenopausal bleeding. In addition, decisions made about the most appropriate investigations that need to be performed, are not always guided by clinical history. The few studies that attempt to include information gained from clinical history to predict the risk of endometrial carcinoma are too small to develop a predictive model.

The aim of our study was to use routinely collected clinical data from history and ultrasound evaluation of the endometrium to develop an algorithm to predict the risk of endometrial carcinoma in women presenting to secondary care with postmenopausal vaginal bleeding.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) diagnosis — 2018 criteria with 2023 update states that PCOS should be diagnosed using the 2018 International Evidence-based Guideline criteria (building on the 2003 Rotterdam criteria), requiring two of three features (clinical/biochemical hyperandrogenism, ovulatory dysfunction, or polycystic ovaries on ultrasound), with anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) now usable instead of ultrasound; when irregular menstrual cycles and hyperandrogenism are present, ultrasound or AMH are not required, and in adolescents both hyperandrogenism and ovulatory dysfunction are required with ultrasound and AMH not recommended due to poor specificity.

### Gestational dating by metabolic profile at birth: a California cohort study [^1146aLK8]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Accurate gestational dating is a critical component of obstetric and newborn care. During pregnancy, gestational age informs the scheduling and management of clinical visits and laboratory testing, determination of the appropriateness of fetal growth, management and timing of delivery, evaluation of the pregnancy as being at risk for preterm and/or postterm delivery, and the application of interventions including, for example, the use of antenatal corticosteroids and magnesium for neuroprotection. In the newborn period, gestational dating informs critical decisions around resuscitation (particularly in newborns born around the limits of viability) and is essential for tracking growth and neurodevelopmental function.

Accurate gestational dating is also important for establishing population-level rates of preterm birth (PTB). Measuring and tracking this rate across time is essential for establishing baselines and for resource planning aimed at reducing these outcomes and their associated burden within and across populations. While first-trimester ultrasound is recognized as the best method to establish gestational age for most pregnancies, ultrasound dating becomes less reliable as gestation progresses. Prenatal ultrasound dating is also available only in sites with the resources to purchase the equipment and hire trained technicians. As such, prenatal ultrasound is not available in some rural and low- and middle-income country settings.

In the absence of early ultrasound, many clinicians rely on last menstrual period (LMP) for gestational dating. LMP can be unreliable given that a number of factors can influence dating including poor recall, irregular cycle length, and bleeding in early pregnancy. Symphysis-fundal height (SFH) > 20 weeks is also used for pregnancy dating, but is often inaccurate due to factors such as multiple pregnancy, maternal size, polyhydramnios and oligohydramnios, and fetal growth restriction.

When no other measures of gestational dating are available (eg, fetal ultrasound, LMP, SFH), other measures used for gestational dating at birth include the Dubowitz method (which incorporates 34 physical and neurological assessments), the Ballard method (which uses 6 physical and neurological measures taken within 30 and 42 hours of age), and the New Ballard score (which uses an expanded list of features over the original Ballard method). While all of these measures provide useful information when no other data are available, like with use of LMP and SFH, these methods have been shown to be less accurate when there is intrauterine growth restriction.

### Can ultrasound replace dilation and curettage? A longitudinal evaluation of postmenopausal bleeding and transvaginal sonographic measurement of the endometrium as predictors of endometrial cancer [^1154YYHg]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to evaluate postmenopausal bleeding and transvaginal sonographic measurement of endometrial thickness as predictors of endometrial cancer and atypical hyperplasia in women whose cases were followed for ≥ 10 years after referral for postmenopausal bleeding.

Study Design

Women (n = 394) who had postmenopausal bleeding from November 1987 to October 1990 underwent transvaginal sonographic measurement of endometrial thickness and curettage. It was possible to assess the medical records (regarding recurrence of a postmenopausal bleeding, development of endometrial cancer, and death) in 339 of the 394 women (86%) ≥ 10 years after referral for postmenopausal bleeding.

Results

Thirty-nine of the 339 women (11.5%) had endometrial cancer, and 5 women (1.5%) had atypical hyperplasia. The relative risk of endometrial cancer in women who were referred for postmenopausal bleeding was 63.9 (95% CI, 46.0–88.8); the corresponding relative risk for endometrial cancer and atypical hyperplasia together was 72.1 (95% CI, 52.8–98.5) compared with women of the same age from the general population of the same region of Sweden. No woman with an endometrial thickness of ≤ 4 mm was diagnosed as having endometrial cancer. The relative risk of the development of endometrial cancer in women with an endometrial thickness of > 4 mm was 44.5 (95% CI, 6.5–320.1) compared with women with an endometrial thickness of ≤ 4 mm. The reliability of endometrial thickness (cutoff value, ≤ 4 mm) as a diagnostic test for endometrial cancer was assessed: Sensitivity, 100%; specificity, 60%; positive predictive value, 25%; and negative predictive value, 100%. The incidence of endometrial cancer or atypical hyperplasia in women with an intact uterus whose cases had been followed for ≥ 10 years was 5.8% (15/257 women) compared with 22.7% (15/66 women) in women who had ≤ 1 episode of recurrent bleeding. No endometrial cancer was diagnosed in women with a recurrent postmenopausal bleeding who had an endometrial thickness of ≤ 4 mm at the initial scan.

Conclusion

Postmenopausal bleeding incurs a 64-fold increase risk for endometrial cancer. There was no increased risk of endometrial cancer or atypia in women who did not have recurrent bleeding, whereas women with recurrent bleeding were a high-risk group. No endometrial cancer was missed when endometrial thickness measurement (cutoff value, ≤ 4 mm) was used, even if the women were followed up for ≤ 10 years. We conclude that transvaginal sonographic scanning is an excellent tool for the determination of whether further investigation with curettage or some form of endometrial biopsy is necessary

### Adolescent polycystic ovary syndrome according to the international evidence-based guideline [^116DgeZS]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Diagnosing polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) during adolescence is challenging because features of normal pubertal development overlap with adult diagnostic criteria. The international evidence-based PCOS Guideline aimed to promote accurate and timely diagnosis, to optimise consistent care, and to improve health outcomes for adolescents and women with PCOS.

Methods

International healthcare professionals, evidence synthesis teams and consumers informed the priorities, reviewed published data and synthesised the recommendations for the Guideline. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework was applied to appraise the evidence quality and the feasibility, acceptability, cost, implementation and strength of the recommendations.

Results

This paper focuses on the specific adolescent PCOS Guideline recommendations. Specific criteria to improve diagnostic accuracy and avoid over diagnosis include: (1) irregular menstrual cycles defined according to years post-menarche; > 90 days for any one cycle (> 1 year post-menarche), cycles < 21 or > 45 days (> 1 to < 3 years post-menarche); cycles < 21 or > 35 days (> 3 years post-menarche) and primary amenorrhea by age 15 or > 3 years post-thelarche. Irregular menstrual cycles (< 1 year post-menarche) represent normal pubertal transition. (2) Hyperandrogenism defined as hirsutism, severe acne and/or biochemical hyperandrogenaemia confirmed using validated high-quality assays. (3) Pelvic ultrasound not recommended for diagnosis of PCOS within 8 years post menarche. (4) Anti-Müllerian hormone levels not recommended for PCOS diagnosis; and (5) exclusion of other disorders that mimic PCOS. For adolescents who have features of PCOS but do not meet diagnostic criteria an 'at risk' label can be considered with appropriate symptomatic treatment and regular re-evaluations. Menstrual cycle re-evaluation can occur over 3 years post menarche and where only menstrual irregularity or hyperandrogenism are present initially, evaluation with ultrasound can occur after 8 years post menarche. Screening for anxiety and depression is required and assessment of eating disorders warrants consideration. Available data endorse the benefits of healthy lifestyle interventions to prevent excess weight gain and should be recommended. For symptom management, the combined oral contraceptive pill and/or metformin may be beneficial.

Conclusions

Extensive international engagement accompanied by rigorous processes honed both diagnostic criteria and treatment recommendations for PCOS during adolescence.

### Measure do not guess: a call to action to end assumed and estimated menstrual cycle phases in research [^113SCsT6]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2024). High credibility.

The problem

Sometimes, a parameter of interest (eg, ovulation) can be measured in various ways (eg, urinary luteinising hormone kits or transvaginal ultrasound), which are open to debate, but nevertheless, these are still measurements; nothing is guessed. When you assume something, you accept it is true or certain to happen without proof. When you estimate something, you take a guess (ie, a rough calculation based on something else). In both cases, you have not used a technique that allows you actually to measure the parameter of interest. You exploit the relationship between a somewhat associated variable (ie, regular menstruation) and a parameter (ie, the remaining phases of the menstrual cycle). As such, it is assumed that an event has occurred (eg, ovulation), and then the timing of that event is estimated (eg, it occurs at the halfway point of the cycle). Assumptions and estimations are made regardless of what is happening (eg, assuming ovulation has definitely occurred when, in reality, it may not have). These assumptions and estimates are not always harmless; many ovarian hormone profiles exist, and regular menstruation does not preclude menstrual dysfunctions, which go undetected with assumed and estimated phases. When adopting an assumed or estimated approach transparent reporting, including the quantification of confidence in these assumptions and estimations, is of utmost importance. While some limitations are often described, and rarely — if ever — are all of the implications of these assumptions and estimations clearly explained to the reader or user. Studies using an assumed and estimated menstrual cycle phase approach frequently do us a disservice; for example, they use the same terminology when assuming or estimating as other authors use when measuring (eg, using specific phase names associated with measurements — such as 'early luteal' — when they have not measured but assumed that phase and should in fact use the broader term 'non-bleeding day'). When the prevailing narrative is that female populations have been underserved by research, accepting assumptions and estimates is not the progress it is purported to be.

### Menstrual technology innovations and the implications for heavy menstrual bleeding [^11421ZLa]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

Assessment of patients' menstrual health is standard of care for clinicians caring for menstruating individuals. Obstetricians and gynecologists have a critical role in educating patients on normal menstruation, assessing patients with symptoms that suggest a problem with menstruation, and providing guidance on evaluation for and treatment of abnormal uterine bleeding. To provide these assessments and guidance, it is important for obstetricians and gynecologists to ask patients about the type of menstrual products they use and to have up-to-date knowledge of all of the menstrual product options to answer questions, provide counseling related to their use, and understand what kinds of experiences (leaking or flooding around products or rate of change of products) may signal a problem with heavy menstrual bleeding that requires further assessment or treatment (Table 2).

In clinical care and research settings, the multiple means of evaluating individuals' menstrual flow are based on the use of specific menstrual products. Quantitative methods, such as the alkaline hematin method, and semiquantitative methods, such as the pictorial bleeding assessment chart, depend on collection or recording of used sanitary pads or napkins and tampons. Similarly, most bleeding-related quality-of-life questionnaires and common clinical questions used to structure a menstrual history require the patient or research participant to report how often they change fully saturated pads or tampons. Newer technologies to manage menstrual bleeding, such as period-specific undergarments and menstrual cups or discs, have not been incorporated into these measures and may not be clearly evaluated during clinical encounters. This may increasingly present challenges to appropriately determining whether or not an individual is experiencing heavy menstrual bleeding.

To address these challenges, improved data on emerging menstrual technologies' absorbency and use and patient preferences is essential. With these data, clinicians and researchers could adapt how they evaluate and provide education and guidance to individuals by appropriately incorporating the specific type of menstrual products used by the individual patient or research participant. Increased variety in menstrual products gives people who menstruate increased ability to personalize menstrual management across the life course and across a variety of settings such that their menstrual health is not only less burdensome but, in some instances, empowering.

### Abnormal uterine bleeding in adolescents [^112WyvXe]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Abnormal and irregular bleeding are extremely common in the adolescent period and can be looked upon as a part of normal reproductive development. It is essential to have a firm grasp on the normal, physiologic development of the menstrual cycle. Prompt recognition and treatment of the situations that may indicate underlying disorders or diseases is possible. It is important to recognize the distinct needs, goals, and developmental stages of adolescent patients. No single therapy or approach is universal in the diagnosis and treatment, but must be tailored to the needs of the individual adolescent and her situation.

### ACR appropriateness criteriaFirst trimester vaginal bleeding [^113dWHe4]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Vaginal bleeding is not uncommon in the first trimester of pregnancy. The majority of such patients will have a normal intrauterine pregnancy (IUP), a nonviable IUP, or an ectopic pregnancy. Ultrasound (US) is the primary imaging modality in evaluation of these patients. US, along with clinical observations and serum human chorionic gonadotropin levels, can usually distinguish these causes. Although it is important to diagnose ectopic pregnancies and nonviable IUPs, one should also guard against injury to normal pregnancies due to inappropriate treatment with methotrexate or surgical intervention. Less common causes of first trimester vaginal bleeding include gestational trophoblastic disease and arteriovenous malformations. Pulsed methods of Doppler US should generally be avoided in the first trimester when there is a normal, or a potentially normal, IUP. Once a normal IUP has been excluded, Doppler US may be useful when other diagnoses such as retained products of conception or arteriovenous malformations are suspected. MRI may occasionally be helpful as a problem-solving tool. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® second and third trimester vaginal bleeding [^116xsbf6]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Vaginal bleeding can occur throughout pregnancy with varied etiologies. Although history and physical examination can identify many etiologies, imaging, in particular ultrasound (US), is the backbone of current medical practice. US pregnant uterus transabdominal, US pregnant uterus transvaginal, and US duplex Doppler velocimetry are usually appropriate for the evaluation of women with painless vaginal bleeding, those with painful vaginal bleeding, and also for those with second or third trimester vaginal bleeding with suspicion of or known placenta previa, low-lying placenta, or vasa previa. US cervix transperineal may be appropriate for those with painless or painful vaginal bleeding but is usually not appropriate for second or third trimester vaginal bleeding with suspicion of or known placenta previa, low-lying placenta, or vasa previa. Because the outcome of pregnancies is unequivocally related to the specific etiology of the vaginal bleeding, knowledge of imaging results directly informs patient management to optimize the outcome for mother and fetus. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

Not otherwise classified

There exist other entities within or affecting the uterus that may lead to AUB; however, many are rare, have an unclear relationship, or are otherwise not included in FIGO System 2. Therefore, these possible causes or contributors to AUB symptoms have been categorized as not otherwise classified or AUB‐N. It is quite possible that one or more of these diagnoses may be reassigned to a new or existing category in the future.

At present, AUB‐N includes arteriovenous malformations and cesarean scar defects. Uterine arteriovenous malformations are abnormal connections between uterine arteries and veins. They are rare, can be congenital or acquired, and usually occur in women of reproductive age or after pregnancy. They represent a potential cause of life‐threatening bleeding. Diagnostic imaging can include ultrasound, computerized tomography (CT), MRI, and digital subtraction angiography; however, the appropriate technique depends on the patient's clinical situation and comorbidities. As an acute cause of AUB, clinical management focuses primarily on gaining hemodynamic stability, after which definitive management depends on the age of the patient and fertility desires.

The high prevalence of cesarean scar defects reflects the high and increasing prevalence of cesarean section, which the WHO estimates currently at 20%, with an expected increase to one in three by 2030. The cesarean scar defect tends to be located in the anterior wall of the uterus, at the site of the hysterotomy incision, and has the potential to hold menstrual blood within the defect leading to a unique pattern of early‐cycle intermenstrual bleeding and prolonged menstruation recently described in a systematic review and meta‐analysis.FIGO System 1 can be used to identify this bleeding pattern and the diagnosis can be made by one or a combination of TVUS, sonohysterography, MRI, and hysteroscopy.

Sonohysterography should not be performed in a woman who is pregnant or who could be pregnant; in patients with regular cycles, scheduling is usually in the follicular phase after menstrual flow has completely or almost completely ceased and before ovulation, and in patients with regular cycles, SIS should ideally be performed before the 10th day of the menstrual cycle. Sonohysterography should not be performed in patients with a pelvic infection or unexplained pelvic tenderness that could be due to pelvic inflammatory disease, and active vaginal bleeding is not a contraindication but may make interpretation more challenging.

### Imaging for acute pelvic pain in pregnancy [^114JhVC8]. Insights Into Imaging (2014). Low credibility.

Obstetric causes

Early pregnancy failure

Spontaneous abortion occurs in approximately 10–12% of known first trimester pregnancies. Although the patient may be asymptomatic, spontaneous abortion commonly results in pain and vaginal bleeding.

Ultrasound is the initial diagnostic test of choice for a first trimester patient with pain and bleeding. Correlating sonographic findings with the maternal serum level of β-HCG can help to indicate whether early pregnancy failure has occurred.

Ultrasound can confirm early pregnancy failure with high specificity if no foetal cardiac activity has been detected by the time the embryo measures 5 mm in length or if the pregnancy is known to be 6.5 weeks without an embryo with a heartbeat.

When the ultrasound examination either shows worrisome features or is inconclusive, such as in cases with an embryo smaller than 5 mm without a heartbeat, follow-up ultrasound is indicated.

The most widely accepted "discriminatory" sizes of the gestational sac using endovaginal ultrasound are an 8-mm mean sac diameter by which a yolk sac must be visualised and a 16-mm mean sac diameter by which an embryo must be visualised for the pregnancy to be considered normal.

Worrisome findings on ultrasound also include slow embryonic cardiac activity, an irregular gestational sac and low position of the gestational sac. Embryonic heartbeat rates below 80 beats per minute (bpm) at 6.0–6.2 weeks or below 100 bpm at 6.3–7.0 weeks' menstrual age are associated with a very high rate of early pregnancy failure.

### Evaluation of irregular menses in perimenarcheal girls: a pilot study [^116yjgj3]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2003). Low credibility.

Acyclic vaginal bleeding in girls within three years of menarche is most commonly attributed to an immature hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis. Assuming this diagnosis may preclude the practitioner from performing more definitive studies and thereby diagnosing other, treatable causes of menstrual irregularities. A retrospective chart review of 178 girls presenting to an inner-city hospital-based adolescent clinic within three years of menarche was performed. Personal and family medical and menarcheal history was assessed, and findings on physical and laboratory examination performed were evaluated. Of the 178 girls still perimenarcheal at presentation, 47 were the focus of this study. Of these, 39 had no significant findings on physical examination, while 3 had signs of functional ovarian hyperandrogenism (FOH) including obesity, hirsutism, and moderate acne with corresponding LH/FSH ratios > 3, although pelvic ultrasound examination revealed normal ovaries. Four of the 39 patients with normal physical exams had LH/FSH testing done, and 1 of the 4 had an abnormal LH/FSH ratio, indicating possible FOH. Two of the 47 patients were pregnant. Other laboratory abnormalities included microcytic, hypochromic anemia in patients, and an elevated Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate in a patient later diagnosed with a rheumatologic disorder. Those perimenarcheal girls presenting with irregular menses and findings including obesity, acne, or pallor, were likely to have treatable causes of menstrual irregularities. In one of the four girls with a normal physical examination, hormonal testing indicated possible FOH, thus suggesting that hormonal evaluation of perimenarcheal girls with menstrual irregularities may be justified, as it may reveal previously unsuspected pathology.

### Contemporary evaluation of women and girls with abnormal uterine bleeding: FIGO systems 1 and 2 [^113YL3j3]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Regularity

The variance in days between the shortest and longest cycles defines regularity, which varies with age; below the age of 18 and after 45 years, ovulatory disorders are frequent and norms are not well defined. For women aged 18–25 years and those 42–45 years of age, cycle length can vary by up to 9 days. For those aged 26–41 years, the range is smaller — up to 7 days. Should the variance in cycle length fall outside these norms, the individual is said to have an irregular cycle, which typically reflects an ovulatory disorder.

Flow volume

In clinical medicine, and even for some investigational trials, flow volume is a subjective measurement and therefore is patient determined. As flow volume may change over the reproductive years, it is helpful to enquire about flow volume both historically and currently. In FIGO System 1, volume is categorized as normal, light, or heavy, per the patient's determination. FIGO adopted a definition of HMB that was first developed and published by the UK's National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in 2007.

Intermenstrual bleeding

The presence of any bleeding between cyclically regular menses is considered abnormal. Intermenstrual bleeding can occur randomly or have a predictable nature depending on when in the cycle it occurs; early cycle (follicular phase before ovulation), midcycle (periovulatory), or late cycle (presumably in the luteal phase).

Unscheduled bleeding on agents that suppress or alter gonadal steroid production

Estrogen‐ and progestin‐containing contraceptive steroids may be administered continuously or cyclically; cyclical use is expected to result in predictable withdrawal bleeding. However, unscheduled bleeding while using these agents, such as birth control pills, rings, patches, or injections, is considered abnormal since they are designed to suppress or alter ovulatory and endometrial function. Other pharmaceutical agents in this category include gonadotropin‐releasing hormones and selective progesterone receptor modulators.

### New sonographic classification of adenomyosis: Do type and degree of adenomyosis correlate to severity of symptoms? [^112jkofZ]. Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology (2019). Medium credibility.

Study Objective

To correlate the type and degree of adenomyosis, scored through a new system based on the features of transvaginal sonography, to patients' symptoms and fertility.

Design

This is a multicenter, observational, prospective study.

Setting

Two endometriosis tertiary referral centers (University of Rome "Tor Vergata" and University of Siena).

Patients

A total of 108 patients with ultrasonographic signs of adenomyosis.

Interventions

A new ultrasonographic scoring system designed to assess the severity and the extent of uterine adenomyosis was used to stage the disease in correlation with the clinical symptoms. Menstrual uterine bleeding was assessed by a pictorial blood loss analysis chart, painful symptoms were evaluated using a visual analog scale, and infertility factors were considered.

Measurements and Main Results

A total of 108 patients with ultrasonographic signs of adenomyosis (mean age ± standard deviation, 37.7 ± 7.7 years) were classified according to the proposed scoring system. Women with ultrasound diagnosis of diffuse adenomyosis were older (p = .04) and had heavier menstrual bleeding (p = .04) than women with focal disease; however, no statistically significant differences were found regarding the presence and severity of dyspareunia and dysmenorrhea. Higher values of menstrual bleeding were found for severe diffuse adenomyosis, with the highest values being found in those with adenomyomas. In patients trying to conceive, the presence of ultrasound findings of focal disease was associated with a higher percentage of infertility than in those with diffuse disease, and the focal involvement of the junctional zone showed a higher percentage of at least 1 miscarriage than in those with diffuse adenomyosis.

Conclusion

The ultrasonographic evaluation of the type and extension of adenomyosis in the myometrium seems to be important in correlation to the severity of symptoms and infertility.

### FIGO best practice guidance for diagnosis and treatment of fibroids [^114uAqqb]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

When the FIGO Regional Congress 2022 took place in Cartagena, Colombia, several experts came together and decided to improve care for patients with fibroids.

Why?

Because the majority of women worldwide develop fibroids during their reproductive phase. Fibroids can impair bladder, bowel, and sexual function, cause infertility, and lead to complications such as early and late miscarriage, breach presentation, postpartum hemorrhage, and irregular menstrual bleeding with anemia, and may even transform into malignancy.

Fibroids mainly affect women during their reproductive years, though their effects can persist beyond this period, depending on their size and location. African women bear the highest burden, with an incidence of up to 80%, and they tend to develop larger and more numerous fibroids compared to other populations.

Therefore, it is essential to equip doctors, nurses, and midwives with up‐to‐date knowledge on the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of fibroids. In regions where the disease burden is high, many health professionals may lack access to the theoretical and practical resources needed to diagnose and manage fibroids effectively.

It was clear from the outset in Cartagena that a free and accessible online resource would benefit health professionals. Since then, members of the four different FIGO committees (Minimal Access Surgery, Menstrual Disorders and Related Health Impacts, Reproductive Medicine, Endocrinology and Infertility, and Childbirth and PPH), representing the five FIGO regions, have joined forces to begin developing this. This online resource is intended to serve as the first FIGO 'toolkit' for doctors, healthcare professionals such as nurses and midwives, as well as graduate and postgraduate students. The aim is to remain precise and detailed, yet highly practical.

### Executive summary of the uterine cancer evidence review conference [^112rsEA8]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). Medium credibility.

EARLY DIAGNOSIS

Postmenopausal bleeding is the presenting symptom in 91% of women with endometrial cancer. Ten percent of women have bleeding in the first year after menopause. The pooled risk of endometrial cancer in women with postmenopausal bleeding is 9%. In a U.K. study, 41 of 85 women with endometrial cancer reported that they were not aware that bleeding was a sign of possible cancer.

Techniques for Evaluation

Transvaginal Ultrasonography

Transvaginal ultrasonography is commonly used for first-line evaluation in patients with postmenopausal bleeding. In a meta-analysis, the sensitivity and specificity for endometrial cancer detection with an endometrial thickness threshold of 5 mm were 90% and 54%, and with a threshold of 3 mm, they were 98% and 35%, respectively. For premenopausal women with AUB, multiple studies have shown saline-infusion ultrasonography to be superior to transvaginal ultrasonography in the detection of intracavitary pathology. – One study compared endometrial thickness to surgical or sonohysterogram findings in premenopausal patients and found endometrial thickness to be inadequate for excluding abnormalities. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists states that ultrasonographic measurement of endometrial thickness in premenopausal women has no diagnostic value and should not be performed.

Office Endometrial Sampling

Office-based endometrial sampling is minimally invasive and cost-effective. The Pipelle catheter is an accurate method of endometrial sampling, with detection rates for endometrial cancer of 99.6% in postmenopausal women and 91% in premenopausal women. The pooled sensitivity of office endometrial sampling for the diagnosis of endometrial cancer was 100% in studies using dilation and curettage (D&C) and 90% in studies using hysteroscopy with biopsy or curettage as the reference standard. Specificity for both ranged from 99% to 100%. The accuracy of office endometrial biopsy is more limited with an inadequate specimen or if the endometrial pathology is not global. In a meta-analysis of 11 studies, the posttest probability of endometrial cancer with a negative biopsy was 0.9%. The SGO and ACOG both recommend that persistent AUB should be further evaluated, with the SGO specifying use of hysteroscopic-guided biopsy. 8,120

Detection of RU, transvaginal, and transabdominal (AU) ultrasound indications, and final diagnosis.

Results

The main indications for RU were menstrual abnormalities, pelvic pain-dysmenorrhea, and vulvovaginitis. When compared according to final diagnosis adolescents with vulvovaginitis (13.9%) and amenorrhea (8.3%) were evaluated more with RU.

Conclusion

RU is highly acceptable and it provides images superior to AU. It can be used in adolescents to visualize the pelvic organs and to exclude genital abnormalities and mass lesions.

### Current evaluation of amenorrhea: a committee opinion [^114eo3SM]. Fertility and Sterility (2024). High credibility.

Amenorrhea evaluation — radiological assessment: Persistently elevated prolactin levels merit further investigation with pituitary imaging (MRI being the preferred modality) as a pituitary adenoma may be identified in 50%–60% of cases of persistent hyperprolactinemia; pelvic ultrasound, preferably via the transvaginal route, should be considered at the forefront of investigations, with ultrasound measures of endometrial thickness and trilaminar endometrial echo pattern correlating with the estrogenic milieu, ovarian morphology contributing validated criteria on the basis of antral follicle count and ovarian volume indices for allowing a diagnosis of PCOS, and an attenuated hyperechoic endometrial echo prompting saline infusion sonography or diagnostic hysteroscopy to evaluate endometrial scarring.

### Abnormal uterine bleeding in adolescents [^115DMgHx]. Current Problems in Pediatric and Adolescent Health Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) is a common diagnosis in the adolescent female population. In recent years, changes have been made to standardize nomenclature, evaluation and management of AUB in adolescents. The terms "abnormal uterine bleeding" and "heavy menstrual bleeding" have replaced terms including "dysfunctional uterine bleeding", "menorrhagia", "metrorrhagia", and "menometrorrhagia". Due to a high prevalence of these diagnoses in this population and resulting effects on quality of life, clinicians should understand and practice current evidence-based care, yet variability continues to exist. Evaluation should be focused on common etiologies of AUB in adolescents, namely non-structural causes, rather than those etiologies more common in adult females. The aim of this article is to review the existing definition, etiologies, pathophysiology, evaluation and management of AUB in adolescent females, with an emphasis on current universally accepted nomenclature and guidelines for use in clinical care.

### Contemporary evaluation of women and girls with abnormal uterine bleeding: FIGO systems 1 and 2 [^116PFowD]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Leiomyomas (uterine fibroids)

Leiomyomas are prevalent benign tumors comprising smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts while being rich in extracellular matrix. Their prevalence increases with age and has been reported to be 69% in white women and 83% in black women by the age of 50. Whereas the exact pathogenesis of a leiomyoma is unknown, it appears to be multifactorial with the involvement of genetics, gonadal steroid exposure, and environmental factors. Leiomyomas can manifest in various phenotypes that vary in size, number, and location. While most women have no symptoms related to their leiomyomas, others may present with a spectrum of symptoms. Consequently, decisions regarding expectant, medical, or procedural interventions depend on a combination of the desires of the individual and their leiomyoma phenotype. Collectively, these circumstances challenge investigators and clinicians to understand when and how a given leiomyoma phenotype is responsible for the experienced symptoms and what therapeutic options best fit the patient's goals, particularly those related to fertility.

The complex context created by this highly prevalent disorder led to the development of the FIGO classification system, which was designed primarily according to the location of the leiomyoma with respect to the endometrium and uterine serosa (Figure 3). Submucous leiomyomas include those in contact with the endometrium, as determined clinically by hysteroscopy or uterine imaging using ultrasound‐based techniques or MRI. While Types 0, 1, and 2 project into the endometrial cavity, Type 3 leiomyomas are those in contact with the endometrium without focal distortion of the endometrial cavity. Intramural leiomyomas are surrounded by myometrium and are deemed Type 4 leiomyomas. In contrast, those in contact with the uterine serosa (Types 5, 6, and 7) are categorized by the degree to which they project out of the uterus, with Type 7 being the pedunculated variety. Type 8 leiomyomas are those found in alternate locations, most commonly the cervix. Especially important for intrauterine surgery, such as hysteroscopic myomectomy, are the tumors that contact both the endometrium and the uterine serosa, which are categorized with two numbers reflecting, in order, the endometrial and serosal relationships (e.g. Types 2–5 or 3–6). It is critically important that clinicians do not attempt hysteroscopic myomectomy, as removal will result in peritoneal cavity entry, termination of the procedure, and the risk of damage to surrounding visceral and other structures including the bladder, bowel, ureters, and blood vessels.

### Estimated performance of transvaginal ultrasonography for evaluation of postmenopausal bleeding in a simulated cohort of black and white women in the US [^116zdsXi]. JAMA Oncology (2021). High credibility.

Importance

Black women in the US with endometrial cancer (EC) are more likely to be diagnosed with advanced-stage disease independent of insured status and histologic type. The most common way of diagnosing EC at early stages is through screening of people with postmenopausal bleeding to detect endometrial thickness (ET). This approach may disproportionately underperform in Black women secondary to a higher prevalence of fibroids and nonendometrioid EC in this population, both of which affect the quality of ET measurement.

Objective

To compare the performance of recommended transvaginal ultrasonography (TVUS) ET thresholds as a screening method to prompt endometrial biopsy by race in a simulated cohort of symptomatic women.

Design, Setting, and Participants

In a simulated retrospective cohort study, based on data from Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) national cancer registry 2012–2016; the US census; and published estimates of ET distribution and fibroid prevalence, diagnostic test characteristics of the 3-mm or more, 4-mm or more, and 5-mm or more ET thresholds for biopsy to capture EC diagnoses were calculated. The simulated cohort was constructed from February 2, 2020 (date of access to SEER data), to August 31, 2020. Analysis occurred from September 30, 2020, to March 30, 2021, including the primary analysis and the sensitivity calculations.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The main outcome measured was accuracy of the TVUS ET threshold to accurately identify cases of EC, measured by sensitivity, negative predictive value, and area under the curve (AUC).

Results

A total of 367 073 simulated Black and White women with postmenopausal bleeding were evaluated, including 36 708 with EC. Among Black women, the currently recommended 4-mm or greater ET threshold prompted biopsy for fewer than half of EC cases (sensitivity, 47.5%; 95% CI, 46.0%-49.0%); of women referred for biopsy, 13.1% were EC cases (positive predictive value, 13.1%; 95% CI, 12.5%-13.6%). The AUC for the 4-mm or more threshold was 0.57 (95% CI, 0.56–0.57). In contrast, among the White women, the 4-mm or more threshold led to biopsy for most with EC (sensitivity, 87.9%; 95% CI, 87.6%-88.3%). Of those referred for biopsy, 14.6% had EC (positive predictive value,14.6%; 95% CI, 14.4%-14.7%); AUC was 0.73 (95% CI, 0.73–0.74). The same variations held for the 3-mm or more and 5-mm or more ET thresholds: sensitivity, positive predictive value, and AUC were consistently lower for Black women than White women.

Conclusions and Relevance

The findings of this simulated cohort study suggest that use of ET as measured by TVUS to determine the need for EC diagnostic testing in symptomatic women may exacerbate racial disparities in EC stage at diagnosis. In simulated data, TVUS ET screening missed almost 5 times more cases of EC among Black women vs White women owing to the greater prevalence of fibroids and nonendometrioid histologic type in Black women.

### The utility of routine ultrasound in the diagnosis and management of adolescents with abnormal uterine bleeding [^111sdVDU]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2017). Low credibility.

Study Objective

Despite the fact that most cases of abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) in adolescence are due to an immature hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian (HPO) axis, the current approach to investigating adolescents who present with AUB often includes pelvic ultrasound to exclude rare structural causes. The aim of this study was to determine whether an ultrasound ordered for the investigation of AUB in adolescents detects any significant anatomic pathology or alters diagnosis and management.

Design, Setting, Participants, and Interventions

A retrospective chart review of 230 patients younger than 18 years of age who presented with AUB to the gynecology clinic at the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto, Canada between January 2010 and December 2012 was completed.

Main Outcome Measures

Findings on pelvic ultrasound and any further imaging as well as management choices for these patients were examined.

Results

Of all patients, 67.8% (156/230) had ultrasound done as part of their AUB workup. The most common diagnosis for the patients who received ultrasound examinations and the patients who did not was AUB due to an immature HPO axis. Of the patients who received an ultrasound examination, 72.4% (113/156) had normal findings; incidental findings were identified in 17.9% (28/156) and polycystic ovary syndrome morphology in 6.4% (10/156). Structural causes of AUB were found in only 2 (1.3%) of the adolescents imaged. No patient had a change in her AUB management plan because of ultrasound findings.

Conclusion

Our results strongly suggest that pelvic ultrasound examination is not required in the initial investigation of AUB in the adolescent population because it did not alter treatment in any of our patients.

Important information to consider during or after insertion

If you suspect that Mirena is not in the correct position, check placement (for example, using transvaginal ultrasound). Remove Mirena if it is not positioned completely within the uterus. Do not reinsert a removed Mirena.
If there is clinical concern, exceptional pain or bleeding during or after insertion, take appropriate steps (such as physical examination and ultrasound) immediately to exclude perforation.

2.3 Patient Follow-up

Reexamine and evaluate patients 4 to 6 weeks after insertion and once a year thereafter, or more frequently if clinically indicated.

### Risk assessment for endometrial cancer in women with abnormal vaginal bleeding: results from the prospective IETA-1 cohort study [^115kJf5H]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Our results highlight that patients' age, parity, and BMI are clinical predictors of endometrial cancer risk in women with abnormal vaginal bleeding, and that other non‐sonographic factors do not add much to risk assessment in these women. Our study confirms the value of sonographic endometrial thickness measurement in postmenopausal women with abnormal uterine bleeding. In premenopausal women, the measurement of endometrial thickness is of less added value. For these women, other features such as gray‐scale ultrasound morphology and Doppler patternsmay be more discriminative. In our study the IQR for age was 43–57 years. This probably reflects the higher incidence of abnormal uterine bleeding in the perimenopausal age group. The diagnosis of the menopausal status in this age group is often tentative: e.g. a regular menstrual cycle may resume after a period of amenorrhea of more than 12 months or frequent episodes of uterine bleeding may occur in the absence of significant ovarian activity mimicking a menstrual cycle. In contrast to menopausal status, the use of age as a risk factor is not prone to interpretation and has to be preferred.

Our study has shown that patient characteristics other than age, parity, and BMI are of little added value to assess the risk of EC in women with abnormal uterine bleeding. In abnormal uterine bleeding, knowledge about patient's age, parity, and BMI is sufficient as basic risk assessment for endometrial malignancy in women with abnormal bleeding, before referral for additional tests, such as sonographic endometrial thickness measurement. In postmenopausal women, sonographic measurement of endometrial thickness substantially improves EC risk assessment.

### A practical approach to the diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome [^114GbuAM]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2004). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is primarily achieved through clinical history and physical findings. The principle features are hirsutism or biochemical evidence of excess androgen production and irregular menstrual bleeding caused by the chronic anovulation. Associated findings include insulin resistance with compensatory hyperinsulinemia and obesity. Ultrasound imaging of the ovary has facilitated the diagnosis. It is important to exclude conditions that may mimic PCOS, such as hyperthecosis, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, 21-hydroxylase deficiency, Cushing's syndrome, and androgen-producing neoplasms. These disorders are usually revealed by appropriate laboratory assessment. Screening tests include measurement of serum total testosterone, DHEA sulfate, and 17-hydroxyprogesterone. In addition, in the obese individual, determinations of glucose and insulin levels, as well as a lipid profile, are highly recommended.

### Heavy menstrual bleeding: work-up and management [^114QnpS4]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2016). Low credibility.

Heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB), which is the preferred term for menorrhagia, affects ∼90% of women with an underlying bleeding disorder and ∼70% of women on anticoagulation. HMB can be predicted on the basis of clots of ≥ 1 inch diameter, low ferritin, and "flooding" (a change of pad or tampon more frequently than hourly). The goal of the work-up is to determine whether there is a uterine/endometrial cause, a disorder of ovulation, or a disorder of coagulation. HMB manifest by flooding and/or prolonged menses, or HMB accompanied by a personal or family history of bleeding is very suggestive of a bleeding disorder and should prompt a referral to a hematologist. The evaluation will include the patient's history, pelvic examination, and/or pelvic imaging, and a laboratory assessment for anemia, ovulatory dysfunction, underlying bleeding disorder, and in the case of the patient on anticoagulation, assessment for over anticoagulation. The goal of treatment is to reduce HMB. Not only will the treatment strategy depend on whether there is ovulatory dysfunction, uterine pathology, or an abnormality of coagulation, the treatment strategy will also depend on the age of the patient and her desire for immediate or long-term fertility. Hemostatic therapy for HMB may serve as an alternative to hormonal or surgical therapy, and may even be life-saving when used to correct an abnormality of coagulation.

Cu-IUD bleeding irregularities — counseling and evaluation: Before Cu-IUD placement, provide counseling about potential changes in bleeding patterns during Cu-IUD use, noting that spotting or light bleeding and heavy or prolonged bleeding is common during the first 3–6 months of Cu-IUD use, is generally not harmful but might be bothersome to the patient, and generally decreases with continued Cu-IUD use. If clinically indicated, consider an underlying health condition such as Cu-IUD displacement, STIs, pregnancy, thyroid disorders, or new pathologic uterine conditions (e.g., polyps or fibroids), especially in patients already using the Cu-IUD for a few months or longer who develop new heavy or prolonged bleeding; if an underlying condition is found, treat the condition or refer for care. Explore patient goals, including continued Cu-IUD use (with or without treatment for bleeding irregularities) or Cu-IUD removal.

### Contemporary evaluation of women and girls with abnormal uterine bleeding: FIGO systems 1 and 2 [^114rDDg8]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2023). Medium credibility.

While histopathologic analysis of the myometrium has been the gold standard for the diagnosis of adenomyosis, usually following hysterectomy, such an approach is not applicable to women wishing to preserve their uterus. In the past 20 years, noninvasive methods have been shown to be relatively sensitive and specific for the diagnosis.

Two‐dimensional, 3D, and color Doppler TVUS can be used to detect adenomyosis with a sensitivity of approximately 84%, 85%, and 94%, respectively. There are several features suggestive of adenomyosis that may be detected on ultrasound that can be categorized as direct or indirect as per the revised definitions of the Morphological Uterus Sonographic Assessment (MUSA). Direct features indicate the presence of ectopic endometrial tissue in the myometrium, including myometrial cysts, hypoechogenic islands, and echogenic subendometrial lines and buds. In contrast, indirect features are secondary to the ectopic endometrial tissue, in many cases reflecting the muscular hypertrophy and hyperplasia, and comprise a globular shape of the corpus, asymmetrical myometrial thickening, fan‐shaped shadowing, translesional vascularity, and an irregular or interrupted junctional zone.

It is important to view adenomyosis on a spectrum, defined by the number and type of features, and not as a binary (present or absent) diagnosis. Different individuals may have different numbers and combinations of features. Still, differences in genetics, epigenetics, and molecular expressions within the ectopic endometrial tissue may contribute to the clinical picture seen in a given patient. For example, in work performed in the UK, a single feature of adenomyosis as determined by 2D TVUS was not associated with quantified HMB, but bleeding volume increased proportionally to the total number of features detected.

Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a more expensive technique to diagnose adenomyosis accurately and, in most instances, is used as a second‐line investigation with a sensitivity of 88%–93%. Whereas most MRI features of adenomyosis overlap those seen on TVUS, focusing on the junctional zone and irregularities within provides greater diagnostic potential for MRI.

4 DISCUSSION

Our study shows that knowledge about age, BMI, and parity is informative in assessing the risk of endometrial malignancy in women with abnormal uterine bleeding. Adding other non‐sonographic patient information assumed to be associated with increased risk of malignancy did not allow for better risk assessment. Conversely, adding the sonographic endometrial thickness measurement strongly improved the discrimination between benign and malignant endometrial outcomes.

The strengths of the present study are its prospective design, the large numbers of patients included, the international contribution of cases, and the use of uniform, web‐based data‐capturing sheets. Bleeding pattern has once again been demonstrated to have a more complex correlation with endometrial pathology than commonly considered. Our data suggest focusing more on bleeding frequency than on its intensity/duration. As opposed to the textbook enumeration of risk factors, we propose a triad of factors, comprising easily assessed clinically relevant information. These might save time and energy for healthcare professionals working in a first‐line setting. Our study demonstrates, contrary to the common knowledge, several risk factors that give hardly any added value in the diagnosis of endometrial cancer. We feature a possible novel factor (bra cup size) in endometrial cancer assessment. We provide globally relevant information for first‐line management worldwide, including those countries with more limited availability of more technical tests such as ultrasound scan or magnetic resonance imaging. Of 2856 patients recruited to the study, 22% had no histologic diagnosis and, to avoid selection bias, "no sign of malignancy after 1 year of follow up" was used as proxy for benign outcome.
