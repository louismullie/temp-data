## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which option is NOT part of the male feedback loop that regulates sex hormone production. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the canonical hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal (HPG) axis and enumerate its core components. Then, I should verify the specific negative feedback signals that modulate GnRH and gonadotropins. Next, I will examine each answer choice against this framework. Finally, I will confirm which hormone is extraneous to the HPG axis and state the correct answer with supporting references.

> Let me first confirm the canonical HPG axis in men. The hypothalamus secretes pulsatile GnRH, which stimulates the anterior pituitary to release LH and FSH; LH drives testicular Leydig cells to produce testosterone, and FSH supports Sertoli cells and spermatogenesis, with inhibin B and sex steroids providing negative feedback at the hypothalamus and pituitary to close the loop, so the core components are hypothalamus, pituitary, GnRH, LH, FSH, and testosterone, plus inhibin B as a key gonadal feedback signal [^f8069013] [^e2498de7] [^a53ed94c].

> Wait, let me verify the feedback specifics so I don't overgeneralize. Testosterone exerts negative feedback at both hypothalamic and pituitary levels, and estradiol derived from aromatization also contributes to feedback, particularly on FSH; inhibin B from Sertoli cells selectively suppresses FSH, reinforcing the loop architecture in men [^a53ed94c] [^f5730f2d] [^be638a56].

> Now, I will examine each option against this framework. A, C, D, E, F, and G map directly to the HPG axis: FSH and LH are the pituitary gonadotropins, the pituitary gland is the effector organ, the hypothalamus is the upstream controller, GnRH is the hypothalamic releasing hormone, and testosterone is the principal gonadal hormone providing negative feedback; these are all integral to the loop [^f8069013] [^e2498de7] [^a53ed94c].

> Hold on, I should verify the outlier. Oxytocin is produced by the hypothalamus and released from the posterior pituitary, but it is not part of the HPG axis and does not participate in the negative feedback regulation of GnRH, LH, FSH, or testosterone; its roles are primarily in parturition, lactation, and social bonding rather than gonadal steroid feedback control [^notfound].

> Hmm, wait a minute, could oxytocin indirectly modulate the HPG axis via stress or other pathways? Even if there are broader neuroendocrine interactions, oxytocin is not a canonical component of the HPG feedback loop, and none of the authoritative HPG descriptions list oxytocin as a regulator of sex hormone production, so the correct inference remains that oxytocin is not included in this feedback system [^f8069013] [^e2498de7].

> Therefore, the answer is B, oxytocin, because it is not part of the male HPG feedback loop that regulates sex hormone production, whereas A, C, D, E, F, and G are all core components of that axis [^f8069013] [^e2498de7] [^a53ed94c].

---

The correct answer is **B. oxytocin**. Oxytocin is not part of the male hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal (HPG) axis that regulates sex hormone production. The HPG axis includes the **hypothalamus** (GnRH), **pituitary gland** (LH and FSH), and **testes** (testosterone), which together form a negative feedback loop. Oxytocin is a separate hormone involved in reproduction and social bonding, but it does not regulate sex hormone production in men [^f8069013] [^e2498de7].

## Components of the male sex hormone feedback loop

The male sex hormone feedback loop, also known as the **hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal (HPG) axis**, is a tightly regulated system that maintains hormonal balance and reproductive function. The key components include:

| **Component** | **Role in the feedback loop** |
|-|-|
| Hypothalamus | Secretes gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), which stimulates the pituitary gland to release LH and FSH [^f8069013] [^e2498de7] |
| Pituitary gland | Releases luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) in response to GnRH [^f8069013] [^e2498de7] |
| LH | Stimulates Leydig cells in the testes to produce testosterone [^f8069013] [^a53ed94c] |
| FSH | Stimulates Sertoli cells in the testes to support spermatogenesis and produce inhibin B [^f8069013] [^a53ed94c] |
| Testosterone | - Primary male sex hormone <br/> - Exerts negative feedback on the hypothalamus and pituitary to regulate GnRH, LH, and FSH secretion [^f8069013] [^a53ed94c] |
| Inhibin B | - Produced by Sertoli cells <br/> - Exerts negative feedback on the pituitary to regulate FSH secretion [^f8069013] [^f5730f2d] |

## Role of oxytocin in male physiology

Oxytocin is a hormone produced by the hypothalamus and released by the posterior pituitary gland. It is primarily known for its roles in **childbirth, lactation, and social bonding**. In men, oxytocin is involved in sexual arousal, ejaculation, and social behaviors, but it does not directly regulate the production of sex hormones such as testosterone [^notfound].

---

## Why oxytocin is not part of the feedback loop

Oxytocin is not involved in the **negative feedback regulation** of sex hormone production in men. The HPG axis operates independently of oxytocin, and there is no evidence that oxytocin directly influences GnRH, LH, FSH, or testosterone secretion. Therefore, oxytocin is not considered part of the feedback loop that regulates sex hormone production in men [^f8069013] [^e2498de7].

---

## Conclusion

The correct answer is **B. oxytocin**. Oxytocin is not part of the feedback loop that regulates sex hormone production in men. The HPG axis, comprising the hypothalamus, pituitary gland, LH, FSH, and testosterone, is the primary regulatory system responsible for maintaining sex hormone balance in males [^f8069013] [^e2498de7].

### Sex hormones and heart Failure risk [^dd3555fe]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Heart failure (HF) is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. Although there are inconsistencies, epidemiological studies have implicated sex hormones (SHs) in pathways that are linked to HF. The age-related decline in SH levels causes physiological changes that differentially impact HF risk in both sexes. Conversely, SHs are tightly regulated by complex feedback loops that become disrupted in chronic HF to create a vicious cycle that further worsens the HF syndrome. By altering the androgenic balance, SHs exert variable effects that could impact HF risk in men and women. Further studies are needed to clarify whether measurement of SH levels can identify future HF patients for early intervention, as well as HF patients who may benefit from more intensive treatments.

### Physiology of the hypothalamic pituitary gonadal axis in the male [^e2498de7]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Testosterone synthesis and male fertility are the results of the perfect coordination of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. A negative feedback finely controls the secretion of hormones at the 3 levels. Congenital or acquired disturbance at any level leads to an impairment of reproductive function and the clinical syndrome of hypogonadism. In some cases, this condition is reversible. Once the diagnosis is made, testosterone replacement therapy is the standard therapy; however, novel therapies may improve spermatogenesis while elevating testosterone levels.

### Differential regulation of gonadotropin secretion by testosterone in the human male: absence of a negative feedback effect of testosterone on follicle-stimulating hormone secretion [^bcd9a0b8]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2001). Low credibility.

Studies of sex steroid regulation of gonadotropin secretion in the human male have focused primarily on the respective site(s) of negative feedback of testosterone (T) and estradiol (E(2)). The use of pharmacological doses of sex steroids in these studies has precluded conclusions about the relative roles of T and E(2) in gonadotropin feedback. Thus, the aims of the present study were to 1) determine the relative contributions of T vs. E(2) to the sex steroid component of gonadotropin regulation, and 2) distinguish the feedback effects of T that that are direct (i.e. mediated by the androgen receptor) vs. indirect (mediated by aromatization to E(2)). Two experimental interventions were used: 1) inhibition of aromatization by a selective aromatase inhibitor to examine the impact of selective E(2) withdrawal; and 2) acute medical castration to examine the effect of ablating both T and E(2). Sixteen normal (NL) men (mean age, 30.5 ± 2.2 yr) were studied. Nine NL subjects were treated with the aromatase inhibitor, anastrozole (10 mg, orally, daily, for 5 days). Twelve NL men underwent medical castration with ketoconazole (1-g loading dose followed by 400 mg, orally, four times a day for 5 days). Ketoconazole-treated subjects received concomitant treatment with dexamethasone (0.5 mg twice daily) to prevent the development of adrenal insufficiency. Single blood samples were drawn daily between 0800–1000 h. To ensure that dexamethasone was not altering the gonadotropin response to sex steroid ablation by a direct pituitary effect, five GnRH-deficient men (mean age, 37.6 ± 3.9 yr) underwent GnRH dose-response studies at baseline and after treatment with dexamethasone (0.5 mg twice daily). Aromatase blockade caused significant lowering of E(2) (33 ± 3 to 14 ± 1 pg/mL; P: < 0.0005) with a corresponding increase in T levels (563 ± 42 to 817 ± 81 ng/dL; P: < 0.05). Treatment with ketoconazole resulted in equivalent suppression of E(2) (41 ± 4 to 14 ± 1 pg/mL; P: < 0.0005), but also induced castrate levels of T (491 ± 28 to 40 ± 3 ng/dL; P: < 0.0005). Both treatment regimens were associated with a significant increase in gonadotropin levels. For LH, the percent increase in serum levels after castration was almost 3-fold greater than that seen after selective E(2) withdrawal (275 ± 23% with ketoconazole vs. 95.6 ± 21% with anastrozole; P: < 0.005). Despite the divergent changes in T levels with these two maneuvers (a marked decrease after ketoconazole and a significant increase with anastrozole), the percent rise in FSH levels was similar in the two protocols (91 ± 6% vs. 71 ± 7%, respectively; P: = NS). Inhibin B levels were unchanged after selective E(2) withdrawal (156 ± 23 vs. 176 ± 19 pg/mL), but decreased slightly with ketoconazole (156 ± 15 to 131 ± 11 pg/mL; P: < 0.05). In contrast to the effects of glucocorticoid administration on gonadotropin secretion in women, no significant changes were observed in the GnRH-deficient men treated with dexamethasone in terms of mean LH levels (19.8 ± 3.2 vs. 23.3 ± 5.4 IU/L), mean LH pulse amplitude after GnRH (16.0 ± 2.5 vs. 19.0 ± 5.1 IU/L), or mean FSH levels (8.0 ± 1.9 vs. 9.2 ± 2.4 IU/L, pre vs. post). These studies provide evidence of differential regulation of gonadotropin secretion by T in the human male. T exerts both direct and indirect feedback on LH secretion, whereas its effects on FSH appear to be mediated largely by aromatization to E(2). From these data we conclude that in terms of sex steroid feedback, E(2) is the predominant regulator of FSH secretion in the human male.

### Sex hormones and heart Failure risk [^9afaddda]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Impact of chronic heart failure on sex hormone levels

Prior studies on SHs and chronic HF were mostly performed in men and few were specific for HF subtypes, Table 2. However, SHs are tightly regulated by complex feedback loops that become disrupted in chronic HF to create a vicious cycle that propagates the HF syndrome, Figure 2. Interactions between SHs, metabolic and nutritional changes collectively contribute to HF progression. The SH deficiencies reported in chronic HF are multifactorial and involve pathways related to inflammation and oxidative stress, which are driven in turn by physiological impairments and maladaptive cardiac responses. Testosterone deficiency for instance shifts the metabolic equilibrium in favor of catabolic activities that worsen HF symptoms, and triggers prolonged neurohormonal activation and abnormalities in hemodynamic, autonomic, and ventilatory responses to exercise. In men with chronic HF, depletions in plasma dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, FT, and TTare common and are independent predictors of disease severity, poor prognosis, and increased mortality. Higher SHBG levels were associated with an increased risk of HF hospitalization and CVD mortality independent of testosterone levels in menbut not in women with chronic HF. In men with chronic HFrEF, nonphysiological estradiol concentrations (high or low) have been associated with increased mortality. In postmenopausal women with HFrEF, testosterone deficiency is also common and is associated with a worse clinical profile including poor exercise capacity, right ventricular-pulmonary arterial uncoupling, renal dysfunction, HF-related hospitalization, and mortality.

Bidirectional Relationship Between Sex Hormones and Heart Failure

Heart failure causes metabolic changes that dysregulate sex hormonal equilibrium thereby creating a vicious cycle.

### Relative roles of inhibin B and sex steroids in the negative feedback regulation of follicle-stimulating hormone in men across the full spectrum of seminiferous epithelium function [^f5730f2d]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2008). Low credibility.

Context and Objective

Our aim was to explore the relative roles of gonadal sex steroids and inhibin B in the regulation of FSH across a spectrum of seminiferous epithelium function.

Subjects

The study included three groups: group I, healthy men (n = 31); group II, men with idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism receiving pulsatile GnRH (n = 12) selected to represent a spectrum of seminiferous tubular development, testicular size, and baseline inhibin B levels; and group III, men with functional anorchia (n = 3) receiving testosterone replacement.

Design

Subjects were studied before and after 3 d of acute sex steroid withdrawal.

Setting

The study was conducted at the Mallinckrodt General Clinical Research Center of Massachusetts General Hospital.

Interventions

Acute biochemical castration was achieved using high-dose ketoconazole (groups I and II) or withdrawal of androgen therapy (group III).

Main Outcome Measures

The relationship between FSH and inhibin B in both normal and castrate sex steroid milieu was measured.

Results

In both normal and castrate sex steroid milieus, there was a negative relationship between inhibin B and FSH, best described by a logarithmic model. Acute biochemical castration resulted in the most dramatic increases in FSH in men with the lowest baseline inhibin B levels.

Conclusions

We came to the following conclusions: 1) in the human male, inhibin B is the principal gonadal feedback regulator of FSH secretion unless seminiferous tubular function is severely compromised, and a logarithmic model best describes this relationship; and 2) sex steroid inhibition of FSH secretion is most apparent when serum inhibin B levels fall well below the normal range.

### Inhibition of luteinizing hormone secretion by testosterone in men requires aromatization for its pituitary but not its hypothalamic effects: evidence from the tandem study of normal and gonadotropin-releasing hormone-deficient men [^5b4ed0a1]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2008). Low credibility.

Context

Studies on the regulation of LH secretion by sex steroids in men are conflicting.

Objective

Our aims were to determine the relative contributions of testosterone (T) and estradiol (E2) to LH regulation and localize their sites of negative feedback.

Design

This was a prospective study with three arms.

Setting

The study was conducted at a General Clinical Research Center.

Patients Or Other Participants

Twenty-two normal (NL) men and 11 men with GnRH deficiency due to idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (IHH) participated.

Intervention

Medical castration and inhibition of aromatase were achieved using high-dose ketoconazole (KC) for 7 d with 1) no sex steroid add-back; 2) T enanthate 125 mg im starting on d 4; or 3) E2 patch 37.5 microg/d starting on d 4. Blood sampling was performed every 10 min for 12 h at baseline, overnight on d 3–4 and d 6–7.

Main Outcome Measures

Mean LH levels, LH pulse amplitude, and GnRH pulse frequency were assessed at baseline, d 3–4, and d 6–7.

Results

In NL men, KC caused a 3-fold increase in mean LH on d 3–4, which was stable on d 6–7 with no add-back. Addition of T reduced LH levels (34.6 ± 3.9 to 17.4 ± 3.6 IU/liter, P < 0.05) by slowing GnRH pulse frequency (13.3 ± 0.4 to 6.7 ± 1.0 pulses/12 h, P < 0.005). LH amplitude increased (6.9 ± 1.0 to 12.1 ± 1.4 IU/liter, P < 0.005). E2 add-back suppressed LH levels (36.4 ± 5.6 to 19.0 ± 2.4 IU/liter, P < 0.005), by slowing GnRH pulse frequency (11.4 ± 0.2 to 8.6 ± 0.4 pulses/12 h, P < 0.05) and had no impact on LH pulse amplitude. In IHH men, restoring normal T levels caused no suppression of mean LH levels or LH amplitude. E2 add-back normalized mean LH levels and decreased LH amplitude from 14.7 ± 1.7 to 12 ± 1.5 IU/liter (P < 0.05).

Conclusions

1) T and E2 have independent effects on LH. 2) Inhibition of LH by T requires aromatization for its pituitary, but not hypothalamic effects. 3) E2 negative feedback on LH occurs at the hypothalamus.

### Genetic analyses implicate complex links between adult testosterone levels and health and disease [^149cdda6]. Communications Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Testosterone (T) is the male sex hormone responsible for regulation of development of primary and secondary male sexual characteristics. Individual variation in T levels has been suggested to shape human physiology broadly, including effects on disease risk in both men and women –. Epidemiological studies and randomized clinical trials for T replacement therapy have observed associations between serum T levels and various traits ranging from type 2 diabetes (T2D) and cardiovascular disease to body composition and behavior –. Yet, these studies have yielded partly mixed results, and, in many instances, the proposed relationships between T, complex traits and disease remain elusive.

Besides the disease links, T is a known driver for sex differences. After puberty, men and women differ extensively with respect to their average T levels, with males showing roughly 7–15-fold higher serum total T concentrations. This difference largely results from the testicular T production in males that far exceeds the amount of T produced in the ovaries and the adrenal gland in females, and is known to directly contribute to variation in, for instance, body composition between the sexes.

### An epigenome-wide analysis of sex hormone levels and DNA methylation in male blood samples [^b9b7cf43]. Epigenetics (2023). Medium credibility.

The link between circulating sex hormone levels and DNA methylation in white blood cells could be connected to inflammatory pathways. Inflammation is a complex process involving multiple different immune responses, and both oestrogens and androgens have been shown to have anti-inflammatory effects. Our lab previously investigated associations between circulating levels of inflammatory markers and DNA methylation in samples from the same cohort as in this study, and were able to validate previous findings showing e.g. how CRP levels relate to DNA methylation levels.

Despite our findings, we cannot draw conclusions about the possible mediating aspect of DNA methylation on the association between sex hormones and sex hormone dependent diseases. Additionally, sex hormone levels are regulated through negative feedback loops involving, for example, expression of receptors. However, we found no statistically significant association between DNA methylation and sex hormones in regions coding for these receptors. Thus, we deem it more likely that the direction of the association is that sex hormones, and SHBG, can potentially alter DNA methylation in men.

A major strength of our study is the use of repeated samples, making it possible for us to conduct longitudinal assessments of the relationship between circulating sex hormones, sex hormone binding globulin, and DNA methylation. Although the two previous studies on males also had data at different ages, these were either not repeat measurements of the same individuals or not modelled using mixed effects models. Further major strengths of our study are the use of a validated liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) method to measure sex hormones, as well as the use of the Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC array, covering more than 850,000 CpG sites, to measure DNA methylation. In addition, we included a more comprehensive panel of sex hormones, also containing testosterone precursors (dehydroepiandrosterone and androstenedione), oestrogens (oestrone and oestradiol), and progesterone. All sex hormones and SHBG were measured in plasma collected after at least 8 hours of fasting and during the morning when concentrations of many sex hormones peak. Another strength was the adjustment for potentially important confounders such as BMI, which was measured by a health professional, alcohol consumption and physical activity, aside from age and estimated cell-type composition.

### Gender, sex-steroid, and secretagogue-selective recovery from growth hormone-induced feedback in older women and men [^e412c608]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

Context

GH negatively regulates its own secretion. How gender, sex steroids, and secretagogues modulate GH autofeedback is not known.

Hypothesis/Objective

Supplementation with sex steroids and/or a peptidyl secretagogue will enhance the escape of GH from autoinhibition, thus framing a mechanism for amplifying pulsatile GH secretion.

Subjects and Setting

Ten healthy postmenopausal women and 10 comparably aged men participated at the Clinical-Translational Science Unit.

Design/Interventions

Randomly ordered, double-blind, prospective crossover treatment with placebo vs. testosterone (men) or placebo vs. estradiol (women). Autofeedback was imposed by an iv pulse of GH. Recovery of feedback inhibition was quantified during constant infusion of saline, GHRH, or GH-releasing peptide-2 (three peptide categories).

Outcomes/Results

During negative feedback, total (integrated) GH recovery depended upon gender (P = 0.017), sex hormone (P < 0.001), and peptide category (P < 0.001). Mechanistic analysis revealed that feedback-suppressed nadir GH concentrations were determined by sex-steroid treatment (P = 0.018) but not by gender (P = 0.444). Peak GH escape was controlled by both treatment (P = 0.004) and gender (P = 0.003). Nadir GH and peak GH during feedback were enhanced by GHRH or GHRP-2 (P < 0.001 for both). Gender × peptide (P = 0.012 for nadir GH), treatment × peptide (P < 0.001 total and peak GH), and gender × treatment (P = 0.017 nadir GH) regulated GH recovery interactively.

Conclusion

Gender, sex-steroid supplementation, and secretagogue type confer distinct feedback-rescuing effects, introducing a new level of complexity in the control of pulsatile GH regulation.

### Age and testosterone feedback jointly control the dose-dependent actions of gonadotropin-releasing hormone in healthy men [^428babee]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2005). Low credibility.

Healthy older men manifest combined declines in testosterone concentrations, LH secretory burst mass (amount of LH released per pulse), and feedback-sensitive regularity of unknown cause. To test a unifying hypothesis of simultaneous reductions in GnRH outflow, gonadotrope responsiveness to GnRH, and androgenic negative feedback, we monitored LH secretion 1) after bolus iv injection of a 1000-fold range of randomly ordered individual doses of GnRH on separate mornings, 2) during unmodified (eugonadal) or testosterone-withdrawn (hypoandrogenemic) negative feedback, and 3) in 16 young (age, 18–35 yr) and 15 older (age, 60–85 yr) healthy men. LH secretory burst mass and pattern regularity were quantitated by intensive blood sampling, high specificity LH beta-subunit-directed immunoradiometric assay, deconvolution analysis, and approximate entropy. GnRH dose responsiveness was assessed by four-parameter nonlinear regression analysis. We demonstrated that older men exhibit 1) delayed attainment of GnRH-evoked maximal LH secretion; 2) enhanced potency of GnRH stimulation in both the feedback-intact and feedback-withdrawn states; 3) elevated gonadotrope sensitivity to GnRH, unmasked by experimental testosterone depletion; 4) comparable young adult-like GnRH efficacy, independent of testosterone feedback milieu; and 5) diminished regularity of GnRH-induced LH release evident only during unmodified androgenic feedback. We conclude that a 3-fold interaction among GnRH dose, testosterone concentration, and age governs GnRH action, and age determines both testosterone-modulated and testosterone-independent actions of GnRH.

### Genetic evidence that raised sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) levels reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes [^2b6eccce]. Human Molecular Genetics (2010). Low credibility.

How might genetically lowered SHBG levels increase the risk of type 2 diabetes? Previous studies suggest that rs1799941 has different effects on total testosterone levels in men and women. Dunning et al. showed that the SHBG lowering allele at rs1799941 is not associated with total testosterone levels in postmenopausal women (N = 1975). This means that women with genetically lower SHBG levels are exposed to proportionally more of the adverse effects of the biologically active unbound testosterone. In contrast, higher testosterone levels are thought to protect against adverse metabolic effects in men and Ahn et al. showed that the SHBG raising allele at rs1799941 is strongly associated with higher total testosterone levels in men (N = 4678). This explanation is complicated by the fact that free testosterone levels are maintained in men by a strong feedback loop whereby luteinizing hormone (LH) production from the pituitary gland in the presence of low androgen levels stimulates testosterone production in the testes. This should mean that genetically lower SHBG levels will not greatly affect free testosterone levels in men. However, there is recent evidence that bound testosterone may be biologically active. If this is the case, then men with lower total testosterone due to lower SHBG will be exposed to less of the protective metabolic effects of androgens, despite similar levels of unbound testosterone.

There are additional implications of our results that require further study. First, our results and those of Ding et al. are not altered by adjustment or matching for BMI despite the fact that increased BMI and adiposity are correlated with reduced SHBG levels. This could mean that altered SHBG levels are part of the reason why increased BMI causally increases the risk of type 2 diabetes. Second, a SNP (rs6259) in the SHBG gene has been associated with prostate cancer and there is increasing evidence that there may be a casual link to the inverse association between prostate cancer and type 2 diabetes, although our results suggest that this requires additional studies of rs1799941 in prostate cancer.

In conclusion, a large type 2 diabetes case–control study provides strong statistical support for a role of SHBG and sex hormones in the aetiology of type 2 diabetes.

### Central aspects of systemic oestradiol negative-and positive-feedback on the reproductive neuroendocrine system [^56a12bfd]. Journal of Neuroendocrinology (2020). Medium credibility.

The central nervous system regulates fertility via the release of gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH). This control revolves around the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, which operates under traditional homeostatic feedback by sex steroids from the gonads in males and most of the time in females. An exception is the late follicular phase in females, when homeostatic feedback is suspended and a positive-feedback response to oestradiol initiates the preovulatory surges of GnRH and luteinising hormone. Here, we briefly review the history of how mechanisms underlying central control of ovulation by circulating steroids have been studied, discuss the relative merit of different model systems and integrate some of the more recent findings in this area into an overall picture of how this phenomenon occurs.

### Circulating testosterone as the hormonal basis of sex differences in athletic performance [^159029b5]. Endocrine Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Clinically, exogenous testosterone replicates fully all effects of endogenous testosterone on every reproductive and nonreproductive organ or tissue, with the sole exception of the testis. Sperm production in the testis requires a very high concentration of testosterone (typically 100-fold greater than in the general bloodstream), which is produced in nature only by the action of the pituitary hormone LH. LH stimulates the Leydig cells in the interstitial space of the testis between seminiferous tubules to produce high intratesticular concentrations of testosterone, which are necessary and sufficient to initiate and maintain sperm production in the adjacent seminiferous tubules. This high concentration of testosterone also provides a downhill gradient to supply the rest of the body, where circulating testosterone acts on androgen-responsive tissues to produce and maintain masculine patterns of androgenization. When exogenous testosterone (or any other androgen) is administered to men, pituitary LH is suppressed by negative feedback and the sperm production halts for as long as exogenous testosterone or androgen exposure continues, after which it recovers. However, even the reduction in spermatogenesis and testis size when men are treated with exogenous testosterone is only a matter of degree. It is well established in rodents that spermatogenesis is induced by exogenous testosterone when the testosterone concentrations in the testis are high enough to replicate what occurs naturally via LH stimulation. However, direct replication that high-dose testosterone also initiates and maintains spermatogenesis in humans is not feasible, as these testosterone doses are 10- to 100-fold higher than could be safely given to humans. Nevertheless, confirmatory evidence in humans is available from rare cases of men with an activating mutation of the chorionic gonadotropin/LH receptor. This mutation causes autonomous testicular testosterone secretion leading to precocious puberty arising from the premature adult male circulating testosterone concentrations that lead to complete suppression of circulating gonadotropin (LH, FSH) secretion. In this illustrative case the testis was exposed to nonphysiologically high testosterone concentrations (but without any gonadotropin stimulation) that induced sperm production and allowed for natural paternity. This indicates that even for spermatogenesis, exogenous testosterone can replicate all biological effects of endogenous testosterone in accordance with the relevant dose-response characteristics.

### Associations of plasma sex-related hormone and protein levels and alcohol dependence [^48b3d360]. Addiction (2025). Medium credibility.

Several proteins regulate the biosynthesis of peripheral steroid sex hormones and their bioavailability in the circulation, including pituitary hormones, follicle‐stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) and blood proteins albumin and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG). Briefly, gonadotropin‐releasing hormone (GnRH) is released from the hypothalamus. On reaching the anterior pituitary, GnRH stimulates the secretion of FSH and LH into the blood circulation. At the gonads, FSH and LH stimulate gamete production and maturation as well as steroid sex hormone production. These hormones in turn inhibit hypothalamic GnRH secretion, forming an inhibitory feedback loop. In blood, the majority of steroid sex hormones are protein‐bound, with only a small fraction remaining free to interact with receptors or diffuse into cells. Therefore, the ability of steroid sex hormones to elicit their actions also depends on the levels of steroid‐binding proteins in blood including albumin, SHBG (binds to testosterone and estradiol) and corticosterone binding globulin (binds to progesterone). In addition to steroid sex hormones, the levels of these regulatory proteins were found to differ between individuals with AUD and controls and they varied at different phases after drinking cessation. Therefore, the alteration in peripheral steroid sex hormone levels observed in individuals with AUD may result from upstream signaling of their biosynthesis, and their downstream functions may be affected by their bioavailability, justifying studying these molecules alongside steroid sex hormones. However, most studies to date examined the relationships between steroid sex hormones and their regulatory proteins independently (or in ratios) with AUD. Given their inter‐relatedness, analyzing these hormones and proteins together using multivariate methods may provide deeper insights into their dysregulations in AUD.

### Sex-specific association between gut microbiome and fat distribution [^d8d1cdec]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Previous studies have shown a positive association between testosterone and android adiposity, and a positive association between estrogen and gynoid fat deposition, which are likely to partially explain the difference in fat distribution between men and women. Besides the association between fat distribution and hormone, gut microbiota can also be affected by the systemic sex hormone level. Yurkovetskiy et al. compared the male and female microbiota before and after puberty in mouse models, concluded that puberty-related hormonal changes led to the separation in the male and female microbiota, as prepubescent differences were not observed. They also observed the microbiota of castrated postpubescent male mice getting similar to their female counterparts. Inversely, the study also showed that microbiota elevated androgens in the mouse model. It has also been reported that changes in sex hormone levels were associated with microbiome compositions in human. Although the mechanism is still unclear, there seem to be a feedback loop between sex hormones and the gut microbiota. Further, gut microbiota also modulates fat deposition through producing short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) as a bacterial fermentation product, increasing enzyme lipoprotein lipase (LPL), which catalyzes the release of fatty acid, and stimulating local angiogenesis and vascular remodeling which induces local fat accumulation –. Evidence have shown obesity alters microbial colony in both mouse models and human studies, but no studies have addressed how does regional adiposity, in turn, affects local microbiota. Potentially, like the interaction between sex hormone and microbiome, there is also a feedback loop between regional adiposity and microbiome. According to our study, the taxa associated with android and gynoid fat ratio in men and women, although sharing moderate overlap at family and genus level, do not have any species-level overlap responsible for the same association. This indicates sex could potentially determine a subgroup of gut microbiota that are sex-hormone sensitive and responsible for regional adiposity. Due to the observed sexual dimorphism of the detected microbial taxa in men and women, different sex hormones may preferentially select microbial species, and these species could carry out physiological functions, such as altering hormone levels, interacting with regional adiposity.

### Contrasting negative-feedback control of endogenously driven and exercise-stimulated pulsatile growth hormone secretion in women and men [^0d27307d]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2004). Low credibility.

GH represses its own secretion via rapid and reversible feedback exerted at key hypothalamic loci. The primary mechanisms include stimulation of somatostatin release and inhibition of GHRH outflow. Autoinhibition is prominent in the adult male rat but diminutive in the female animal. The sex contrast reflects important differences in central neuropeptide signaling in this species. No comparable insights into gender-specific control of GH autofeedback are available in the human. To examine this issue, we quantitated acute recombinant human (rh)GH-induced inhibition of baseline (resting) and aerobic exercise-stimulated GH secretion in healthy young men (n = 8) and early follicular-phase women (n = 6). Each subject underwent four fasting, morning inpatient infusion studies in a prospectively randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, within-subject cross-over design. The feedback paradigm comprised 6-min bolus iv infusion of saline or rhGH (10 microg/kg) followed in 120 min by rest or submaximal aerobic (individually calibrated) bicycle ergometry for 30 min. Concomitantly, blood was sampled every 10 min for 6 h, and sera were submitted to immunochemiluminometric GH assay (sensitivity 0.005 microg/liter). Biexponential deconvolution analysis was applied to estimate stimulated GH secretory-burst mass (microg/liter per 90 min after onset of exercise or rest). Women and men had statistically comparable serum estradiol but unequal testosterone concentrations. Repeated-measures ANOVA documented a significant three-way interaction among gender, stimulus type (rest or exercise), and feedback status (saline or rhGH injection) in determining GH secretory-burst mass (P = 0.008). There were prominent two-factor interactions among gender and exercise (P < 0.001); gender and rhGH-induced negative feedback (P = 0.002); and exercise and rhGH feedback (P = 0.006). Gender comparisons disclosed that women, compared with men, maintain 20-fold higher GH secretory-burst mass at rest (P < 0.001); 40-fold less stimulation of pulsatile GH release by exercise than rest (P < 0.001); and 20-fold greater inhibition of GH secretory-burst mass by rhGH than saline at rest (P < 0.05). Observed feedback contrasts by sex were specific, inasmuch as gender did not affect absolute estimates of exercise-stimulated GH secretion (microg/liter/90 min); nadir GH concentrations (microg/liter) enforced by rhGH infusion; and the time latency (min) to manifest maximal inhibition after rhGH injection. In summary, the present clinical investigation unmasks: 1) markedly greater fractional feedback inhibition of pulsatile GH secretion by rhGH in young women than men; and 2) partial resistance of the aerobic-exercise stimulus to GH autofeedback in both women and men. We postulate that sex-steroid-specific control of somatostatin and GHRH outflow may mediate the former gender contrasts, whereas unknown (gender-independent) factors may determine the capability of exercise to significantly antagonize GH autoinhibition.

### In young men, a moderate inhibition of testosterone synthesis capacity is only partly compensated by increased activity of the pituitary and the hypothalamus [^7f99bf0b]. Clinical Endocrinology (2010). Low credibility.

Context

The classical interpretation of the feedback regulation of the male hypothalamo-pituitary-gonadal axis predicts that a partial inhibition of testosterone (T) synthesis will result in a compensatory rise in LH secretion. The question arises as to whether such a compensation is complete or that decreased T synthesis may result in a lower plasma T concentration.

Objective

To investigate whether a moderate inhibition of T synthesis capacity will be fully compensated by increased LH secretion. DESIGN, SUBJECTS AND INTERVENTIONS: In nine young healthy men, we partially inhibited T synthesis capacity using ketoconazole (KTZ) 100 mg four times daily. On day -6 (1 week prior to KTZ intake), days 1 and 8 of KTZ administration blood was drawn [07:00 h (t(1)), 10:00 h (t(2)), 13:00 h (t(3))] for evaluation of T, LH, oestradiol (E2), 17-OH-progesterone (17OHP), progesterone (PR) and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG). On day 8, 5000 IU of hCG were administered to evaluate the maximal T secretion under KTZ.

Results

Administration of KTZ resulted in an acute, moderate but significant decrease of plasma T concentration. On day 8, plasma LH, 17OHP and PR were elevated relative to day -6 and day 1, but mean T was still lower compared to day -6. Mean E2 and SHBG were only slightly affected by KTZ. After stimulation by hCG, plasma T was restored to its baseline level.

Conclusion

These results argue against the assumption that a moderate decline in T synthesis capacity will be compensated completely by increased LH secretion.

### Erosion of endogenous testosterone-driven negative feedback on pulsatile luteinizing hormone secretion in healthy aging men [^87d0805b]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2004). Low credibility.

The present study tests the intuition that successful aging in men is marked by: 1) impaired feedforward by endogenous LH concentrations (con) of testosterone (Te) secretion (sec); and/or 2) attenuated feedback by unmanipulated Te con of LH sec. The goal was to assess both implicit linkages analytically without disrupting normal pathway coupling. This strategy required: 1) assay of paired LH and Te con sampled every 10 min for 24 h in 13 older (O) (ages 60–78 yr) and 13 young (Y) (ages 18–30 yr) men; 2) deconvolution-based estimation of LH and Te sec rates; 3) lag-specific cross-correlation analyses of the relationships between LH and Te con and sec; and 4) statistical contrasts by age stratum. Salient outcomes were: 1) O and Y men maintain comparable LH con drive of Te sec, viz maximal r = +0.51 and r = +0.52, respectively, at an optimal time lag of 50 min (both P < 0.001 against random LH and Te associations); 2) elderly subjects exhibit reduced Te con inhibition of LH sec [minimal r = -0.008 (O) vs. r = -0.10 (Y), P < 0.01 at a time lag of 40 min]; 3) mean (24-h) LH con do not differ by age; and 4) molar Te/sex hormone-binding globulin con are lower in the elderly than in Y individuals (P < 0.01). In conclusion, noninvasive analyses predict that attenuation of endogenous Te feedback restraint on the hypothalamo-pituitary unit may be an early biological marker of adaptive changes in the GnRH-LH-Te ensemble axis in the healthy O male.

### Importance of inhibin B in the regulation of FSH secretion in the human male [^be638a56]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2001). Low credibility.

Regulation of FSH secretion in the male involves a complex balance between stimulation by GnRH from the hypothalamus, inhibitory feedback by sex steroids (T and E2) and inhibin B (Inh B) from the gonads, and autocrine/paracrine modulation by activin and follistatin within the pituitary. The aim of the present study was to delineate the feedback control of FSH in the human male with specific reference to the relative roles of sex steroids vs. Inh B. Two experimental human models were used: 1) normal (NL) men subjected to acute sex steroid withdrawal (-T, -E2, + Inh B), and 2) functional castrate males (-T, -E2, -Inh B). Nine NL men (age range, 25–45 yr) and three castrate males (age range, 23–47 yr) were studied. The NL men underwent acute sex steroid suppression using high dose ketoconazole (1-g loading dose, followed by 400 mg, orally, four times daily for 150 h). Gonadotropin secretion was characterized by frequent blood sampling every 10 min for 12 h at baseline and on d 3 and 6 of sex steroid ablation. In the three castrate subjects, blood sampling was performed every 5 min for 24 h 8 wk after discontinuing androgen replacement therapy. In the NL men, treatment with ketoconazole resulted in a decline to castrate levels in T (451 ± 20 to 38 ± 7 ng/dl; P < 0.0005) and E2 (39 ± 4 to 15 ± 2 pg/ml; P < 0.005) and a modest, but significant, decline in Inh B levels, which remained within the normal range (183 ± 19 to 136 ± 13 pg/ml; P < 0.005). This suppression of sex steroids was associated with a more marked increase in mean LH (9.5 ± 0.9 to 24.9 ± 2.0 IU/liter; P < 0.0001) than FSH levels (5.1 ± 0.7 to 10.0 ± 1.5 IU/liter; P < 0.005), with the latter not exceeding the normal adult male range. The castrate subjects had a mean T level of 66 ± 8 ng/dl, an E2 level of 20 ± 1 pg/ml, and undetectable Inh B levels. Despite a similar sex steroid milieu, the mean FSH levels observed in NL men after acute sex steroid ablation were approximately 6-fold lower than those seen in the castrate subjects (10.0 ± 1.5 vs. 59.5 ± 17.7 IU/liter; P < 0.0005). In contrast, mean LH levels in the NL men were less than 3-fold lower than those in castrate subjects (24.9 ± 2.0 vs. 66.8 ± 20.1 IU/liter; P < 0.005). From this human model of acute sex steroid withdrawal, we conclude that Inh B is likely to be the major feedback regulator of FSH secretion in the human male.

### Age or factors associated with aging attenuate testosterone's concentration-dependent enhancement of the regularity of luteinizing hormone secretion in healthy men [^f2672f9c]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Healthy older men have reduced testosterone (Te) production and frequent, small irregular LH pulses. Which is cause and which is effect are not known.

Rationale

In model systems, frequent and irregular LH pulses reflect attenuated feedback inhibition by Te.

Hypothesis

Factors associated with aging impair negative feedback by Te.

Subjects and Setting

Healthy men at an academic medical center were studied.

Methods

The study used quantification of the regularity of LH release patterns during blockade of gonadal steroidogenesis and graded transdermal Te addback in 18 healthy men aged 18–65 yr.

Results

In the cohort as a whole, stepwise Te repletion repressed LH concentrations (P = 0.001) and enhanced the quantifiable orderliness of LH release patterns (P < 0.001). By regression analysis, age attenuated the capability of increasing Te concentrations to regularize LH secretion patterns (P = 0.019). However, after a fixed GnRH stimulus, the effect of Te on LH regularity was invariant of the age factor (P = 0.16), thus pointing to a hypothalamic locus of impaired Te feedback.

Summary

Aging disrupts the capability of systemic Te concentrations to maintain orderly LH secretion under endogenous, but not exogenous, GnRH drive.

Conclusions

Age or factors associated with increased age reduce negative feedback by any given total Te concentration on hypothalamopituitary GnRH-LH outflow, thus contributing to disorderly LH secretion.

### A unifying biology of sex steroid-induced apoptosis in prostate and breast cancers [^bde3a88f]. Endocrine-Related Cancer (2018). Low credibility.

The sex steroid hormones i.e. androgens in men and estrogens in women play critical roles in the development and progression of prostate and breast cancers. Prostate cancer development relies on the androgen receptor (AR), whereas breast cancer development primarily relies on the estrogen receptor (ER). The majority of prostate and breast cancers are hormone dependent (Fig. 1). Antihormone therapies have had a profound impact in reducing the burden from breast cancer, worldwide. Here, we will address whether the lessons learned in breast cancer can be applied to prostate cancer therapy. Whether treatment strategies are the same or not for both diseases, resistance to antihormone treatments occurs in both prostate and breast cancers.

Figure 1
A schematic representation of the androgen and estrogen deprivation therapy in prostate cancer and pre- and postmenopausal women with breast cancer. (A) The hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal and adrenal axis in prostate cancer with their therapeutic targets. The hypothalamus produces gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), which stimulates the adenohypophysis of the pituitary to produce adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). This in turn, stimulates the adrenal gland cortex to produce androgens: dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S) predominately, DHEA and androstenedione (AD) into the circulation. These androgens (A), alongside testosterone (T) from the testes, are converted in the prostate to their potent form, dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Dihydrotestosterone stimulates the growth of prostate cancer cells and exerts a negative feedback loop onwards to the hypothalamus and pituitary. Both, GnRH agonists/antagonists suppress LH production and cause a subsequent decline in serum testosterone to castrate levels. However, GnRH agonists (with chronic use) lead to the downregulation of GnRH receptors, whereas, GnRH antagonists usually cause an immediate blockade to the receptor. At the adrenal level, abiraterone inhibits adrenal androgen de novo steroidogenesis. At the prostate level, androgen receptor (AR) inhibitors are used and they have different mechanisms of action. For example, enzalutamide competitively inhibits the AR binding to DHT, inhibits nuclear translocation, and DNA and cofactor binding. Whereas, Bicalutamide is a highly selective, competitive and silent antagonist to the AR, which was also found to accelerate AR degradation. (B) The hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis in premenopausal women with breast cancer and their therapeutic targets. The hypothalamus produces gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), which stimulates the adenohypophysis of the pituitary to produce luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). This in turn, stimulates the granulosa cells in the ovarian follicles to produce estrogen. However, FSH in particular stimulates the granulosa cells to produce inhibin, which suppresses FSH in a feedback loop and activin, a peripherally produced hormone that stimulates GnRH cells. Estrogen stimulates the growth of breast cancer cells, and exerts a negative feedback loop onwards to the hypothalamus and pituitary. Ovarian suppression can be achieved with LHRH superagonists such as goserelin, which is an analogue of LHRH, and a GnRH or LHRH agonist. Goserelin initiates a flare of LH production and ultimately leads to receptor downregulation. Antiestrogens can be estrogen receptor (ER) competitive blockers such as the Selective ER Modulators (SERMs, i.e. tamoxifen), or pure antiestrogens or what is known as a Selective ER Downregulators (SERDs, i.e. fulvestrant). Third-generation aromatase inhibitors (i.e. anastrozole, letrozole, exemestane) selectively block the aromatase enzyme system at the breast cancer level and therefore suppress estrogen synthesis. (C) The hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis in postmenopausal women with breast cancer and their therapeutic targets. The differences from premenopausal women is that the ovarian follicles are depleted, therefore there is no active production of estrogen and progesterone. This leads to a dramatic increase in GnRH, an increase in FSH serum level relatively to that of LH through the feedback loops. Ovarian suppression is not used as a treatment option.

### Proinflammatory cytokine infusion attenuates LH's feedforward on testosterone secretion: modulation by age [^b9744f65]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

Context

In the experimental animal, inflammatory signals quench LH's feedforward drive of testosterone (T) secretion and appear to impair GnRH-LH output. The degree to which such suppressive effects operate in the human is not known.

Objective

To test the hypothesis that IL-2 impairs LH's feedforward drive on T and T's feedback inhibition of LH secretion in healthy men.

Setting

Mayo Center for Translational Science Activities.

Patients Or Other Participants

A total of 35 healthy men, 17 young and 18 older.

Interventions

Randomized prospective double-blind saline-controlled study of IL-2 infusion in 2 doses with concurrent 10-minute blood sampling for 24 hours.

Main Outcome Measures

Deconvolution analysis of LH and T secretion.

Results

After saline injection, older compared with young men exhibited reduced LH feedforward drive on T secretion (P < .001), and decreased T feedback inhibition of LH secretion (P < .01). After IL-2 injection, LH's feedforward onto T secretion declined markedly especially in young subjects (P < .001). Concomitantly, IL-2 potentiated T's proportional feedback on LH secretion especially in older volunteers.

Conclusion

This investigation confirms combined feedforward and feedback deficits in older relative to young men given saline and demonstrates 1) joint mechanisms by which IL-2 enforces biochemical hypogonadism, viz, combined feedforward block and feedback amplification; and 2) unequal absolute inhibition of T and LH secretion by IL-2 in young and older men. These outcomes establish that the male gonadal axis is susceptible to dual-site suppression by a prototypic inflammatory mediator. Thus, we postulate that selected ILs might also enforce male hypogonadism in chronic systemic inflammation.

### Estradiol (menostar) [^71a7dd5b]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Endogenous estrogens are largely responsible for the development and maintenance of the female reproductive system and secondary sexual characteristics. Although circulating estrogens exist in a dynamic equilibrium of metabolic interconversions, estradiol is the principal intracellular human estrogen and is substantially more potent than its metabolites, estrone and estriol, at the receptor level.

The primary source of estrogen in normally cycling adult women is the ovarian follicle, which secretes 70 to 500 mcg of estradiol daily, depending on the phase of the menstrual cycle. After menopause, most endogenous estrogen is produced by conversion of androstenedione, which is secreted by the adrenal cortex, to estrone in the peripheral tissues. Thus, estrone and the sulfate conjugated form, estrone sulfate, are the most abundant circulating estrogens in postmenopausal women.

Estrogens act through binding to nuclear receptors in estrogen-responsive tissues. To date, two estrogen receptors have been identified. These vary in proportion from tissue to tissue.

Circulating estrogens modulate the pituitary secretion of the gonadotropins, luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), through a negative feedback mechanism. Estrogens act to reduce the elevated levels of these hormones seen in postmenopausal women.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Generally, a serum estrogen concentration does not predict an individual woman's therapeutic response to Menostar nor her risk for adverse outcomes. Likewise, exposure comparisons across different estrogen products to infer efficacy or safety for the individual woman may not be valid.

### Elevated levels of gonadotrophins but not sex steroids are associated with musculoskeletal pain in middle-aged and older European men [^26b3ffa7]. Pain (2011). Low credibility.

A studyinvolving 57 women followed up during their menopausal transition found an association between musculoskeletal pain and E2. In EMAS, we found no relationship between E2 and pain status among middle-aged and older men. A possible explanation for the discrepancy is that higher levels of oestrogens in women may predispose them to greater pain than men.

What are the possible mechanism underlying our observations? The absence of any association between androgens and pain status observed in this cohort may suggest that the age-related decline of T in men may not have an important role in the occurrence of pain, in contrast with the strong association between changes in oestrogen levels and musculoskeletal pain in women. However, disruptions in testicular function (elevated gonadotrophins) appear to be related to the presence of musculoskeletal pain. It is possible that high gonadotrophin levels among men with CWP may be considered as a biomarker for a previous T decline within the normal physiological range (10 to 30 nmol/L), thus indicating a readjustment of the pituitary–testicular feedback set point that compensates for defective T feedback at the hypothalamic–pituitary level, or as genuine androgen deficiency with respect to the man's individual normal level. If so, it might be expected that there would be an association with T that was not the case here. Alternatively, the onset of CWP as a marker of poor health could result in an increase in gonadotrophin levels as an early sign of imminent testicular failure. A further possibility is that alterations in the hormonal feedback mechanisms controlled by the hypothalamus may play a role in the symptomatology of fibromyalgia. Interestingly, the LH receptor has been localised not only in the reproductive organs but also as a functional protein within the central nervous system, including regions of the brain involved in sensory functions. It is biologically plausible, therefore, that LH may have either direct effects within the central nervous system or indirect effects via regulation of neurosteroid production, although this would not explain the observed association of FSH with pain status. However, these 2 hormones are jointly regulated by the hypothalamic gonadotrophin-releasing hormone and their levels usually change in parallel. Prospective data are warranted to confirm these findings and to help determine the temporal nature of the relationships.

### The relationship between bone and reproductive hormones beyond estrogens and androgens [^858f9354]. Endocrine Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

The Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Gonadal Axis: A Historical Perspective and Overview

Reproduction is governed by the HPG axis, which acts as a classical negative feedback loop to regulate gonadal function. Indeed, it was Geoffrey Harris' 1955 monograph "Neural Control of the Pituitary Gland" that first posited that the secretion of pituitary gonadotropins was controlled by chemical substances of hypothalamic origin released into the hypophysial (pituitary) portal circulation. Consequently, this conceptual groundwork led to the isolation and sequencing of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) by the laboratories of Schally and Guillemin in 1971, and their award of the 1977 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. For decades GnRH would be considered the key determinant of reproductive function.

However, in 2003 two independent groups published reports in short succession revealing that humans with inactivating mutations of the kisspeptin receptor (GPR54/KISS1R) resulted in failed puberty and resultant infertility. These landmark findings in reproductive biology were followed by a series of studies demonstrating that kisspeptin (encoded by Kiss1/KISS1) administration acted as a potent stimulator of gonadotropin release in animals and humans, whereas pretreatment with a GnRH antagonist abolished this stimulatory effect of kisspeptin.

In light of such fundamental discoveries, the historical understanding of the hormonal cascade that controls the HPG axis was revised (Figure 1): Kisspeptin sits at the apex of the reproductive axis and is secreted by hypothalamic KISS1 neurons. Kisspeptin activates kisspeptin receptors expressed on GnRH neurons to secrete GnRH into the local hypophyseal-portal circulation in a pulsatile manner. Subsequently, GnRH is responsible for stimulating the biosynthesis and secretion of gonadotropins (luteinizing hormone [LH] and follicle-stimulating hormone [FSH]) from the anterior pituitary gland, which circulate systemically to reach the gonads to promote gamete maturation and the release of sex steroids (estradiol, testosterone, and progesterone). In addition to these established members, gonadal-derived activin and inhibin are closely related reproductive hormones with diametrically opposing biological effects: Activin enhances FSH secretion, whereas conversely inhibin inhibits FSH secretion.

### Diagnosis and treatment of infertility in men: AUA / ASRM guideline part II [^57971a9b]. Fertility and Sterility (2021). High credibility.

Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH) management and endocrine therapy considerations: Patients with HH present with deficient luteinizing hormone (LH) and FSH secretion, and referral to an endocrinologist or male reproductive specialist is encouraged; spermatogenesis can be initiated and pregnancies achieved in many men with idiopathic HH when treated with exogenous gonadotropins or pulsatile GnRH. With gonadotropin treatment for HH, hCG injections are typically initiated with serum testosterone monitored, and after normalization of testosterone, FSH or FSH analogues may be added to optimize sperm production. Exogenous testosterone administration provides negative feedback to the hypothalamus and pituitary gland that can inhibit gonadotropins such that spermatogenesis may decrease or cease altogether, resulting in azoospermia, supporting avoidance of testosterone monotherapy in men desiring fertility. Although not currently FDA-approved for use in men, SERMs such as clomiphene or tamoxifen are often prescribed to attempt improvement in semen parameters and fertility outcomes. While exogenous FSH may be used as an adjunct for HH with good results, in idiopathic infertile men without HH its fertility benefits are measurable but limited; the cost-to-benefit ratio is questionable because men are typically treated for 3 months or more and the incremental increase in pregnancy rates is small. There are no clear, reliable data to support use of supplements (vitamins, antioxidants, nutritional formulations) for men attempting conception; current data suggest they are likely not harmful but of questionable value in improving fertility outcomes.

### Altered thyroid feedback loop in Klinefelter syndrome: from infancy through the transition to adulthood [^dd555c05]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

We propose that the previously described inhibitory mechanism of T on D2 activity may explain the well-known higher circulating fT3 and fT4 levels experienced during puberty and adolescence due to the rising sex steroids. However, other mechanisms might also be involved, like the crosstalk between the somatotropic and gonadal axes.

In our cohort, the hypothalamic-pituitary failure to compensate for lower fT3 and fT4 levels was confirmed by measuring SHBG levels to exclude a defect in peripheral sensitivity to thyroid hormone (see Fig. 4). The hepatocyte nuclear factor-4α is stimulated by fT3, resulting in an enhanced SHBG transcription. Consequently, hypothyroidism is associated with reduced SHBG levels and the opposite is true in hyperthyroidism. In our KS cohort, a clear correlation between fT3 (and fT4) and SHBG was found, confirming a normal peripheral sensitivity to thyroid hormones; still, none with TSH, suggesting an altered central feedback in KS. The proposed mechanism proved correct when further examining adult hypogonadal non-KS men naive to TRT. In fact, they also exhibited values consistent with increased central thyroid hormones sensing, reflected by lower TSH, fT3, and fT4 levels compared to the euthyroid eugonadal controls, and recapitulating some of the alterations observed in KS.

We further aimed to understand the contribution of T to the overall clinical picture. Compared with eugonadal and TRT patients, hypogonadal KS individuals had higher fT4 levels and a reduced fT3/fT4 ratio. These results remained statistically significant even after adjusting for multiple confounders and were confirmed by a negative correlation between cfT and fT4 levels, and a positive correlation with the fT3/fT4 ratio. We speculate that T may exert an indirect effect on skeletal muscular D2 expression/activity, mediated by an increase in lean body mass. Accordingly, hypogonadal men would be characterized by lower peripheral T4 to T3 deiodination, and a resulting relative increase in fT4 (and a consequent reduction in the fT3/fT4 ratio), although in vivo data on this topic are controversial. An alternative explanation may involve T immunomodulatory actions.

### Anabolic-androgenic steroid use in sports, health, and society [^ff676cbd]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2021). High credibility.

Androgen physiology — testosterone (T) production and circulating levels — is outlined: in men, > 95% of T is synthesized in the Leydig cells of the testes; healthy men produce ∼4 to 9 mg of T per day with circulating concentrations of 10–35 nmol·L−1, whereas women have approximately 0.5 to 2.3 nmol·L−1; in blood, testosterone is bound to sex hormone-binding globulin (44%–60%) and to other proteins.

### Increased salt-sensitive blood pressure in women vs men: is relative hyperaldosteronism the mechanism? [^d63eb7c7]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Why Are Basal Aldosterone Levels Higher in Men Than in Women?

Circulating ALDO levels, for the most part, are a product of its production and metabolism rates. Its production rate usually is determined by intrinsic zona glomerulosa properties and its secretagogue levels with Ang II, potassium and ACTH being the most prominent ones. Ang II and potassium appear to be equally potent and sustainable, with endogenous ACTH having a variable effect. Since all 3 secretagogues are increased in men vs women basally, to a variable extent each likely contributes to this sex effect. This conclusion suggests that the "set point" between at least Ang II and K + in their classical negative feedback loops differs between men and women (lower in women) with several physiologic and pathophysiologic sex-based consequences. Support for this hypothesis comes from 3 observations. First, women have more SSBP than men in the presence of lower basal ALDO levels. Second, this increases the likelihood that a non-ALDO mechanism is causing the increased SSBP in women. The most likely mechanism would be a reduced renal plasma flow response to Ang II on the liberal-salt diet. The opposite occurred in women vs men, providing support for an altered ALDO response to salt-loading. Third, ALDO/PRA levels were higher in women vs men, again supportive of an enhanced glomerulosa cell response to its secretagogue.

Alternatively, the answer is in the secretagogues, not the glomerulosa cell. If we assume that women have increased SSBP via a non-ALDO mechanism, this will be accompanied by volume expansion resulting in suppressed PRA and also decreased serum potassium in women vs men. However, this enhanced relationship between ALDO and vascular tissues responses to Ang II in women vs men was present regardless of the level of salt intake. At a population level, this enhanced relationship could be modified by genetic, race, age, or environmental factors. Several of these factors were present in the HyperPATH database. In the ones available, the relationship between ALDO, PRA, and SSBP and biological sex remained the same.

### A unifying biology of sex steroid-induced apoptosis in prostate and breast cancers [^a6647b91]. Endocrine-Related Cancer (2018). Low credibility.

Long-term antiandrogen therapy can affect the hypothalamo–pituitary axis as a negative feedback loop in men, leading to a compensatory increase of circulating androgens. This, by itself, can activate the AR by the law of mass action, but testosterone is not the physiologic ligand as it is required to be converted to dihydroxytestosterone (DHT) in the prostate cancer cell. Increased 5α-reductase enzyme activity contributes to the increase of endogenous androgens in the tumor. This results in the selection of CRPC cells able to convert androgen to endogenous DHT to produce a growth advantage. A polymorphism in the 5α-reductase gene is noted in men of African-American descent, which is responsible for higher enzymatic activity in prostate cancer cells, as well as in prostate cancer cases with bad prognosis. In fact, the intratumoral levels of androgens can be as high as 40% above the baseline levels before ADT. Recently another polymorphism in HSD3B1, which encodes 3β-hydroxysteroid-dehydrogenase-1 has been identified in a retrospective study of CRPC as a factor that correlates with an increased DHT synthesis.

Ligand-independent and receptor-dependent mechanisms of resistance

Most mutations are point gain-of-function mutations and are mostly located in the LBD of the AR and allow other sex steroids, such as glucocorticoids to bind to the AR and activate it. Resistance to abiraterone was demonstrated in some mCRPC tumors with mutated AR. Additionally, alternative AR mRNA splice variants occur that generate constitutively active AR proteins.

Increased expression of certain growth factors are associated with increased activity of the AR in mCRPC as well. The subversion of the AR transcriptional activity via growth factor receptor-mediated growth is called the cross-talk. Epidermal growth factor (EGF), keraticocyte growth factor (KGF) and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-I) can activate the AR and can be reversed by antiandrogens. Tyrosine kinase receptors, such as HER2, which is highly expressed in CRPC cells, can also activate the AR via phosphorylation, through activation of the MAPK and the Akt pathways. The growth factor IL-6 is responsible for the progression of CRPC. This occurs by increasing AR activity by 50% more than observed with DHT alone. Resistance to growth inhibition occurs through the MAPK and STAT3 pathways, induces autophosphorylation of HER2 to activate the AR-mediated cascade independent of the ligand. High expression levels of the AR mRNA are maintained by NF-κB in CRPC cells, which sustains high AR protein levels.

### Adult-onset hypogonadism [^e989679c]. Mayo Clinic Proceedings (2016). Medium credibility.

The influence of aging — testosterone dynamics and hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis changes indicate that among healthy aging men, HPG function may be maintained, yet beginning at age 20 to 30 years, T levels decline by 0.3% to 1.4% per year. Declining T levels are linked to primary testis failure with Leydig cells becoming less responsive to exogenous gonadotropin stimulation and the number of Leydig cells declining, but most older men with low T levels do not have increased LH. Mechanistically, production of GnRH decreases with age and GnRH/LH pulse amplitude diminishes; androgen negative feedback suppression of LH secretion may be increased; sex hormone–binding globulin (SHBG) levels tend to rise in older men causing free T levels to decline; and T shows higher morning levels with dampening of this diurnal rhythm as men grow older. Adult-onset hypogonadism, unlike overall hypogonadism, may be less influenced by age, and in EMAS among men with low T and normal LH levels — men likely to have AOH — age was not a significant predictor.

### Gender difference in the neuroendocrine regulation of growth hormone axis by selective estrogen receptor modulators [^8c5ec82c]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

Context

In men, GH secretion is stimulated by estradiol derived locally from aromatization of testosterone. Recently, we showed that local estrogen also plays a major role in the central regulation of GH secretion in women. Tamoxifen and raloxifene are selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), drugs that block central estrogen action but exert estrogen-like effects in the liver, inhibiting hepatic IGF-I production. The relative impact of SERMs on the GH-IGF-I axis in men and women has not been investigated.

Objective

The aim of the study was to determine whether there is a gender difference in the impact of SERMs on the GH-IGF-I axis.

Design

We conducted a comparative, randomized, open-label, crossover study of tamoxifen and raloxifene.

Patients and Intervention

Ten healthy postmenopausal women and ten healthy men were randomized to 2-wk sequential treatment with tamoxifen (10 and 20 mg/d) and raloxifene (60 and 120 mg/d) with a washout of 2 wk between treatments.

Main Outcome Measures

The GH response to arginine, IGF-I, testosterone, and SHBG was measured.

Results

In women, but not in men, tamoxifen significantly attenuated the GH response to arginine. The GH response was not significantly blunted by raloxifene in both sexes. Both SERMs significantly reduced mean IGF-I levels to a similar degree in men and women. In men, both SERMs significantly increased LH and testosterone levels.

Conclusions

In summary, GH secretion was blunted by tamoxifen in women in the face of reduced IGF-I feedback inhibition but not in men in whom the gonadal axis was stimulated. We conclude that potential blunting of GH secretion in men by SERMs was counteracted by concomitant central stimulation of GH secretion by testosterone. In therapeutic doses, tamoxifen may induce detrimental metabolic effects in women, but not men.

### Update on male hormonal contraception [^3241d3c0]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Action mechanism of male hormonal contraception

The basic mechanism by which hormones affect fertility in men is through the suppression of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) with subsequent reversible inhibition of testicular function, namely spermatogenesis and testosterone production (Figure 1). Both the decrease of testosterone and suppression of FSH lead to a decrease of Sertoli cell function essential for germ-cell maturation. To maintain androgen-dependent physiological functions an androgen (usually testosterone) must be part of the contraceptive regimen.

### Immune system adaptation during gender-affirming testosterone treatment [^ca694d53]. Nature (2024). Excellent credibility.

Infectious, inflammatory and autoimmune conditions present differently in males and females. SARS-CoV-2 infection in naive males is associated with increased risk of death, whereas females are at increased risk of long COVID 1, similar to observations in other infections 2. Females respond more strongly to vaccines, and adverse reactions are more frequent 3, like most autoimmune diseases 4. Immunological sex differences stem from genetic, hormonal and behavioural factors 5 but their relative importance is only partially understood 6–8. In individuals assigned female sex at birth and undergoing gender-affirming testosterone therapy (trans men), hormone concentrations change markedly but the immunological consequences are poorly understood. Here we performed longitudinal systems-level analyses in 23 trans men and found that testosterone modulates a cross-regulated axis between type-I interferon and tumour necrosis factor. This is mediated by functional attenuation of type-I interferon responses in both plasmacytoid dendritic cells and monocytes. Conversely, testosterone potentiates monocyte responses leading to increased tumour necrosis factor, interleukin-6 and interleukin-15 production and downstream activation of nuclear factor kappa B-regulated genes and potentiation of interferon-γ responses, primarily in natural killer cells. These findings in trans men are corroborated by sex-divergent responses in public datasets and illustrate the dynamic regulation of human immunity by sex hormones, with implications for the health of individuals undergoing hormone therapy and our understanding of sex-divergent immune responses in cisgender individuals.

### Sex differences in lipid and lipoprotein metabolism: it's not just about sex hormones [^ab15bd8e]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

It is commonly thought that sex hormones are important regulators of plasma lipid kinetics and are responsible for sexual dimorphism in the plasma lipid profile. Here we discuss the findings from studies evaluating lipid and lipoprotein kinetics in men and women in the context of what we know about the effects of exogenous sex hormone administration, and we conclude that it is more complicated than that. It has become clear that normal physiological alterations in the hormonal milieu (i.e. due to menopause or throughout the menstrual cycle) do not significantly affect plasma lipid homeostasis. Furthermore, parenterally administered estrogens have either no effect or only very small beneficial effects, whereas orally administered estrogens raise plasma triglyceride concentrations — a phenomenon that is not consistent with the observed sex differences and likely results from the hepatic "first-pass effect". The effects of progestogens and androgens mimic only in part the differences in plasma lipids between men and women. Thus, the underlying physiological modulators of plasma lipid metabolism responsible for the differences between men and women remain to be elucidated.

### Critical illness and sex hormones: response and impact of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis [^5c6c2606]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Causes of sex hormone changes during critical illness

Within critically ill patients, corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) inhibits the secretion of GnRH, thereby suppressing pituitary hormone secretion. In addition, a rise in cortisol levels incites a feedback suppression of the secretion of hypothalamic and pituitary hormones, resulting in a similar HPG axis reduction, namely a drop in FSH, LH, and testosterone. Furthermore, the secretion suppression of gonadotropin trials behind the diminished testosterone, which further indicates that the inhibition of the gonads is more severe than the central. The treatment of critically ill patients involves drugs such as dopamine, opioid drugs, and cytokines like interleukin (IL)-1, which could potentially inhibit LH secretion by reducing the amplitude of LH secretion pulses. Clinical studies have revealed that hypogonadism in long-term critically ill male patients is central, originating from the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal junction, which can only be partially counteracted via exogenous iv GnRH pulses. Functional or relative adrenal insufficiency may exist in critically ill patients. Studies have discovered that elevated cortisol levels and diminished dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate levels are closely tied to critical illnesses in patients, despite both being produced by the adrenal gland and ideally should alter in harmony. But low-dose adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation test and Thorn test reveal that the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis was at full stimulation. Furthermore, any additional stimulation to ACTH appears relatively absent.

The rise in estrogen levels is not only a by-product of adrenal activation but may also be the outcome of elevated aromatase activity catalyzed by high-level cytokines like IL-6 or tumor necrosis factor (TNF), leading to the conversion of peripheral androgens into estrogen through aromatization, (Figure 3).

Figure 3.
The mechanism of hormone changes in critically ill patients. In critically ill patients, in addition to the self-adjustment of the HPG axis, high cortisol levels incite a feedback suppression of the secretion of hypothalamic and pituitary hormones. Drugs such as dopamine, opiates, and cytokines could potentially inhibit LH secretion. LPS, TNF-a, IL-6, and IL-2 curtail testosterone secretion, possibly inhibiting GnRH and/or LH secretion by the hypothalamus and pituitary gland. The CRF, produced by the hypothalamus and peripheral tissues such as gonads and immune cells, restricts the secretion of GnRH in the hypothalamus. In addition, glucocorticoids inhibit the secretion of LH, estrogen, and progesterone. E2 amplifies the inhibition of LH pulse induced by CRF.

### Testosterone blunts feedback inhibition of growth hormone secretion by experimentally elevated insulin-like growth factor-I concentrations [^c1b900f8]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2005). Low credibility.

The present study tests the hypothesis that a high dose of testosterone (Te) drives GH and IGF-I production, in part, by blunting autonegative feedback by the end-product peptide. To this end, we infused saline or recombinant human IGF-I (10 microg/kg.h iv for 6 h) in seven healthy men ages 51–72 yr after administration of placebo (Pl) and Te in randomized order. GH release was quantitated fasting before and after injection of GHRH (1 microg/kg). Statistical analyses disclosed that Te vs. Pl: 1) increased the mean concentration of GH from 0.15 ± 0.045 to 0.48 ± 0.11 microg/liter (P = 0.007) and IGF-I from 108 ± 5.0 to 124 ± 4.1 (P = 0.047) without altering GHRH-induced GH release; 2) elevated the GH nadir from 0.13 ± 0.03 to 0.23 ± 0.06 microg/liter (P < 0.05) in the control session and from 0.06 ± 0.02 to 0.14 ± 0.04 microg/liter (P = 0.038) during IGF-I infusion; 3) augmented GHRH-stimulated GH release from 3.0 ± 0.56 (Pl) to 3.7 ± 0.52 microg/liter (Te) (P < 0.05) during IGF-I infusion; and 4) did not influence estimated IGF-I kinetics. In summary, supplementation of a high dose of Te in middle-aged and older men attenuates IGF-I feedback-dependent inhibition of nadir and peak GH secretion. Both effects of Te differ from those reported recently for estradiol in postmenopausal women. Accordingly, we postulate that Te and estrogen modulate IGF-I negative feedback differentially.

### Short-term aromatase-enzyme blockade unmasks impaired feedback adaptations in luteinizing hormone and testosterone secretion in older men [^870f72e1]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2005). Low credibility.

The mechanisms subserving hypoandrogenemia and relative hypogonadotropism in older men are not known. The present study tests the clinical hypothesis that aging impairs hypothalamopituitary adaptations to feedback withdrawal induced by antagonism of estrogen biosynthesis. To this end, we appraised gonadal axis responses to estrogen depletion induced by anastrozole (a potent and selective aromatase inhibitor) in nine older and 11 young men vs. placebo in 17 other older and eight young men. The study design comprised a prospectively randomized, double-blind, parallel-cohort intervention. To monitor LH release, blood was sampled every 10 min for 24 h; LH concentrations were assayed by two-site monoclonal immunoradiometric assay; pulsatile LH release quantitated by a model-free discrete peak-detection technique (Cluster); feedback-dependent orderliness of LH secretion via the approximate entropy statistic; and 24-h rhythmicity of LH concentrations by cosine analysis. At baseline, older men had comparable estradiol and testosterone but lower LH concentrations than young controls. Exposure to anastrozole reduced (24-h pooled) serum estradiol concentrations by 50% (P < 0.001) and elevated mean LH concentrations by 2.1-fold (P < 0.001) in both the young and older cohorts. However, older men failed to achieve young adult augmentation of the following: 1) total testosterone concentrations (P < 0.01) or molar testosterone to SHBG ratios (P < 0.01); 2) incremental LH pulse amplitude (P < 0.001) and LH peak area (P < 0.01); 3) mean LH pulse frequency (P = 0.0044); and 4) quantifiable irregularity (approximate entropy) of LH release patterns (P < 0.001). FSH concentrations became comparable in the two age cohorts. In summary, administration of a potent and selective aromatase antagonist reduces estradiol and elevates mean LH concentrations equivalently in young and older men. The low estrogen-feedback state in elderly men unmasks diminished incremental LH pulse amplitude and area; absence of further acceleration of LH pulse frequency; impaired regulation of the orderliness of LH release; and reduced testosterone to SHBG ratios. Thus, aging alters expected hypothalamopituitary-gonadal adaptations to short-term partial estrogen depletion in healthy men.

### Interpretation of reproductive hormones before, during and after the pubertal transition-identifying health and disordered puberty [^550f2173]. Clinical Endocrinology (2021). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Puberty is the transitional period in adolescence that leads to the attainment of reproductive capacity. The physical, psychological and emotional changes that occur are the consequence of sex hormone synthesis by the gonads, under the control of the hypothalamic–pituitary axis (Figure 1). The activation of pulsatile gonadotropin‐releasing hormone (GnRH) secretion from the hypothalamus is the endocrine hallmark of the onset of puberty. The development of this hypothalamic–pituitary axis starts in foetal life, with rising gonadotropin concentrations from the end of the first trimester, although these are lower in males than in females and decline by birth in both sexes. The axis is reactivated in early infant life, in a period named 'mini‐puberty', peaking between 1 week and 3 months of age in both sexes but with a later peak and longer tail in female infants. There is then a prolonged period of dormancy in young children between the approximate ages of 2 and 8–9 years (Figure 2).

Figure 1
Schematic of the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis. GnRH production from hypothalamic GnRH neurons is regulated by kisspeptin, neurokinin, dynorphin (KNDy) and other upstream signalling, including GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons. GnRH travels via the portal circulation to the anterior pituitary where it stimulates LH and FSH production. These gonadotropins act in males on the testes and in females on the ovaries to produce the sex steroids testosterone and estradiol/progesterone (E2/P), respectively. There is negative feedback from inhibin B (IB) on the pituitary, and a mix of negative and positive feedback from sex steroids on the pituitary and on the hypothalamus via kisspeptin neurons. −, negative feedback; +, positive feedback; FSH, follicle‐stimulating hormone; GnRH, gonadotropin‐releasing hormone; LH, luteinizing hormone [Color figure can be viewed at]

### The regulation of aldosterone secretion by leptin: implications in obesity-related cardiovascular disease [^ccf85a91]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Although it has been known for some time that increases in body mass enhance aldosterone secretion, particularly in women, the origin of this elevation in aldosterone production is not well defined. Adipocyte-derived factors have emerged as potential candidates to increase aldosterone production in obesity.

Recent Findings

Emerging evidence suggests the presence of a mechanistic link in which the adipocyte-derived hormone leptin stimulates aldosterone production in obesity, thereby creating a positive feedback loop for obesity-associated cardiovascular disease. In addition, recent reports give credence to the concept that this leptin-aldosterone stimulation pathway in obesity is an underlying mechanism for sex-discrepancies in obesity-associated cardiovascular disease.

Summary

Leptin appears as a new direct regulator of adrenal aldosterone production and leptin-mediated aldosterone production is a novel candidate mechanism underlying obesity-associated hypertension, particularly in females.

2.2.1.1 Males

The Leydig cells of the testes synthesize testosterone from cholesterol through a series of enzymatic conversions stimulated by the binding of LH its receptor, the luteinizing hormone/chorionic gonadotropin receptor (LHCGR) on the Leydig cell membrane. LHCGR numbers and downstream responsiveness decrease after exposure to LH for at least 24 h, leading to insensitivity to LH after daily injections of LH or human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) compared to alternate day injections. Thus, hCG or LH must be administered at 2–3 day intervals to eliminate such downregulation when assessing the response of the testes to LH‐like stimulation.

The majority of circulating testosterone is bound to sex‐hormone‐binding globulin (SHBG) or albumin, with the remaining 'free' testosterone considered to be responsible for biological activity. Testosterone is modulated by prereceptor metabolism through conversion, either by 5α‐reductase type 2 (a surface enzyme located on the genital skin and elsewhere) to dihydrotestosterone or by aromatase (CYP19A1) to estradiol. Testosterone and dihydrotestosterone both bind to the androgen receptor but with a greater affinity for dihydrotestosterone. The testosterone/dihydrotestosterone‐receptor complex attaches to the steroid‐responsive region of genomic DNA to initiate androgen‐dependent transcription and translation.

Dihydrotestosterone is responsible for virilisation of the external genitalia and for most of the secondary sexual characteristics of puberty, including phallic growth, prostate enlargement, androgen‐induced hair loss and beard growth. Testosterone promotes muscle development and stimulates enzymatic activity in the liver and haemoglobin synthesis. Testosterone sends negative feedback to regulate LH secretion, directly or after conversion to estradiol, through suppression of GnRH secretion via kisspeptin neurons at the hypothalamic level and by acting directly on gonadotropin synthesis in the pituitary gland (Figure 1). Estradiol aromatized from testosterone stimulates bone maturation at the epiphyseal plate.

FSH binds to specific receptors on the cell surface of Sertoli cells resulting in a similar intracellular cascade to that produced by LH binding on Leydig cells. FSH causes an increase in the mass of seminiferous tubules and supports the development of sperm, particularly in the early stages of meiosis. Complete spermatogenesis and spermiogenesis is dependent on both FSH and intratesticular concentrations of testosterone and DHT.

### Muting of androgen negative feedback unveils impoverished gonadotropin-releasing hormone / luteinizing hormone secretory reactivity in healthy older men [^3b1146ff]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2001). Low credibility.

Plasma bioavailable testosterone concentrations decline in healthy older men without a uniformly commensurate rise in serum LH concentrations, which disparity is consistent with a hypothesis of relative hypogonadotropism. Likewise, preserved gonadotrope responsiveness to exogenous GnRH stimulation, despite an attenuated amplitude of endogenous LH pulses, points to reduced hypothalamic GnRH feedforward signaling in aging males. To appraise GnRH/LH secretory reserve more directly in older men, we have compared daily LH secretion, driven by profound short-term blockade of androgen biosynthesis by oral ketoconazole administration, in nine young (ages, 18–32 yr) and seven older (ages, 60–73 yr) volunteers. The ability to unleash endogenous GnRH-driven LH secretion in response to acute testosterone withdrawal was quantitated by sampling blood every 10 min, for 24 h, followed by high-precision immunoradiometric assay. The resultant serum LH concentration profiles were analyzed by: 1) model-free discrete peak detection (Cluster) analysis; 2) the approximate entropy statistic to quantitate pattern regularity; and 3) 24-h rhythmic (cosinor) analysis. At baseline, mean and integrated (24-h) serum LH concentrations were similar in both age cohorts. However, Cluster analysis established an elevated LH peak frequency [18 ± 0.86 (older) vs. 13 ± 1.3 pulses/24 h (young), P = 0.0028] and a reduced incremental LH pulse area [37 ± 6.9 (older) vs. 106 ± 20 (young) IU/L x min, P = 0.016] in older men. Approximate entropy calculations also revealed more irregular LH release patterns in older men before intervention (P = 0.00089). Feedback stress, achieved by ketoconazole-induced androgen deprivation, unmasked further neuroregulatory defects in older volunteers, who failed to equivalently increase the: 1) mean (24-h) serum LH concentration [i.e. to 5.0 ± 0.99 (older men) vs. 9.0 ± 1.1 (young) IU/L, P = 0.000071]; 2) maximal LH peak height (to 6.1 ± 1.1 vs. 10.4 ± 1.2 IU/L, P = 0.00043); 3) incremental LH pulse area (to 41 ± 8.8 vs. 87 ± 20 IU/L x min, P = 0.016); 4) interpeak nadir serum LH concentration (to 4.0 ± 0.77 vs. 7.9 ± 1.0 IU/L, P < 10(-6)); 5) the quantitable irregularity of LH release (P = 0.00089); and 6) the mesor of 24-h rhythmic LH secretion (P = 0.000062). In summary, experimental imposition of a novel hypoandrogenemic open-loop feedback stressor, for 48 h, to heighten hypothalamic GnRH feedforward drive, unveils impoverished augmentation of LH pulse mass, impaired orderliness of LH release, and diminished 24-h rhythmic LH secretion in older men. The foregoing trilogy of neuroregulatory defects identifies unequivocally attenuated hypothalamo-pituitary reactivity to muting of androgen negative feedback in the aging male.

### Pituitary gonadotropin-releasing hormone II as a possible mediator of positive estrogen feedback [^45a942db]. Journal of Neuroendocrinology (2025). Medium credibility.

While highly plausible, this generally accepted mechanism is based on two assumptions. First, the same population of GNRH‐producing cells ultimately respond to both negative and positive estrogen feedback, either directly or indirectly via kisspeptin neurons. Second, pituitary gonadotropes respond to only a single molecular form of GNRH. Moreover, this mechanism does not adequately explain how estrogens inhibit GNRH secretion for most of the follicular phase, and yet in the middle of the cycle they suddenly become highly stimulatory. A novel explanation was proposed more recently when it was discovered that humansand rhesus macaques, express two different hypothalamic forms of GNRH (i.e. GNRH1 and GNRH2), where the two populations of GNRH neurons are completely distinct, and that both molecular forms of GNRH can stimulate LH release in vivo by acting through the same GNRH receptor 1 (GNRHR1). More importantly, estradiol was shown to inhibit GNRH1 expression in the hypothalamus but stimulate GnRH2 expression, leading to the idea that hypothalamic regulation of the primate female reproductive axis may be orchestrated by two distinct GnRH cell populations. It was further posited, that the pulsatile release of GNRH1 plays a primary role in stimulating pulsatile LH release from the adenohypophysis, which in turn stimulates follicular development and ovarian sex‐steroid production and is responsible for mediating negative estrogen feedback.

### Critical illness and sex hormones: response and impact of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis [^f8069013]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

The HPG axis and sex hormones under normal condition

The HPG axis, one of the three classical feedback mechanisms, functions under normal conditions through a series of procedures involving multiple hormones. The GnRH, typically characterized by its pulsatile nature, is secreted by the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus. Following its release, it stimulates anterior pituitary gonadotropin cells to release luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormones (FSH) via the pituitary portal vein system. –

In males, LH primarily prompts testicular Leydig cells to generate androgens, while FSH collaboratively works with testosterone to act on Sertoli cells, ultimately accelerating sperm formation. FSH also has a role in activating the aromatase in Sertoli cells, which enhances the conversion of testosterone to estradiol. This induces a reduction in the pituitary gland's responsiveness to GnRH besides locally modulating testosterone secretion. Furthermore, inhibin, another hormone produced by the testes, exerts a potently inhibitory effect on FSH secretion within the pituitary gland, while the same physiological dose of inhibin has less effect on LH. Other hormones, such as leptin, can promote GnRH secretion, whereas prolactin, corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), and various cytokines tend to inhibit GnRH release(Figure 1).

Figure 1.
Physiological feedback of the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis. The GnRH, secreted by the hypothalamus, stimulates anterior pituitary gonadotropin cells to release LH and FSH. In males, LH prompts testicular Leydig cells to generate androgens, while FSH works with testosterone to act on Sertoli cells, accelerating sperm formation. FSH also has a role in activating the aromatase in Sertoli cells. Inhibin, another hormone produced by the testes, exerts an inhibitory effect on FSH secretion. In females, estrogen, secreted by granulosa cells, has a feedback effect on the hypothalamus and pituitary gland, including negative feedback and positive feedback before ovulation. LH stimulates the synthesis of androgens by theca cells during the follicular phase, fostering the maturation and ovulation of oocytes. During the luteal phase, LH bolsters the synthesis and secretion of progesterone. Concurrently, FSH fosters the conversion process from androgens to estrogen in the ovaries.

Physiological Development of the Reproductive Axis

Role of the Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Gonadal Axis

Gonadal function is regulated by hormones of the central HPG axis. GnRH is secreted in a pulsatile fashion into the hypophyseal portal venous blood by the "GnRH pulse generator," which consists of specialized neurons in the human hypothalamus. GnRH pulses exert a stimulating effect on GnRH receptors that are located on gonadotropic cells of the anterior pituitary gland. In response, the gonadotropins luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) are cosecreted into the bloodstream. The intensity of pituitary secretion of both pituitary hormones is differentially modulated by the amplitude and frequency of GnRH pulses. Male and female gonads respond to gonadotropin-stimulation by secreting sex steroid hormones.

In females, ovarian theca cells produce androstenedione and testosterone. These hormones diffuse to the neighboring granulosa cells, where they are used as precursors for estrogen synthesis. FSH stimulates estrogen secretion by granulosa cells, which in turn induces a peak of pituitary LH secretion that induces ovulation. Thereafter, luteinized granulosa and theca cells produce progesterone and estrogens on stimulation by both gonadotropins.

In males, testicular Leydig cells produce and secrete testosterone on LH stimulation. Testosterone, together with its 5-α reduced form, 5-dihydrotestosterone (DHT), are the key bioactive androgens. FSH stimulates testicular Sertoli cells with a 2-fold effect. Specifically, during mini-puberty and early puberty, Sertoli cells respond to FSH stimulation by undergoing mitotic divisions. During later puberty and adulthood, the role of Sertoli cells is to form the niche that nurtures germ cells on FSH stimulation, to enable spermatogenesis. Spermatogenesis includes meiosis of diploid spermatogonia to haploid pachytene spermatocytes and completion of spermatogenesis through development of elongated spermatids from round spermatids (spermiogenesis). This results in the production of mature spermatozoa.

Human HPG axis function is modulated by feedback mechanisms of the gonads to the hypothalamus and pituitary, including both positive and negative mechanisms. While testosterone, estradiol, progesterone, and inhibins act as inhibitors on GnRH, LH, and FSH secretion, activins exert a positive feedback.

### Emerging insights into hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis regulation and interaction with stress signalling [^c081c230]. Journal of Neuroendocrinology (2018). Low credibility.

Reproduction and fertility are regulated via hormones of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis. Control of this reproductive axis occurs at all levels, including the brain and pituitary, and allows for the promotion or inhibition of gonadal sex steroid secretion and function. In addition to guiding proper gonadal development and function, gonadal sex steroids also act in negative- and positive-feedback loops to regulate reproductive circuitry in the brain, including kisspeptin neurones, thereby modulating overall HPG axis status. Additional regulation is also provided by sex steroids made within the brain, including neuroprogestins. Furthermore, because reproduction and survival need to be coordinated and balanced, the HPG axis is able to modulate (and be modulated by) stress hormone signalling, including cortiscosterone, from the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. This review covers recent data related to the neural, hormonal and stress regulation of the HPG axis and emerging interactions between the HPG and HPA axes, focusing on actions at the level of the brain and pituitary.

Materials and methods

Derivation of the mathematical model

The present model is based on our minimal mathematical model, which was developed from the understanding of the interrelationships between the hormones in HPT axis regulationand theoretical principles of endocrine regulation. In addition, it constructs the essential mechanisms described by the earlier study, using physiologically realistic production rate constants and binding affinities of the hormones to the relevant receptor, including saturation effects (, doi: 10.5281/zenodo.7344861). We followed a systems biology approach, as described in general by Alon. We did not seek to develop the full molecular details for the complex feedback and feedforward mechanisms which are only partly known. The rationale for our approach is based on the concept of relational stability where the activities of the feedback loops respond to each other. System stability is expressed as a state of conditional balance between the strengths of the influences of the appropriate loops. This allows us to compare the predictions of the present model constructed with physiological parameters and those of the minimal model. With appropriate scaling based on fractions of the normal levels of the hormones, the two models showed high congruence (, doi: 10.5281/zenodo.7344861).

### Defining reference ranges for serum anti-Müllerian hormone on a large cohort of normozoospermic adult men highlights new potential physiological functions of AMH on FSH secretion and sperm motility [^be36220c]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Relationship Between Serum AMH and Both Reproductive Hormones and Semen Parameters

A significant positive relationship was observed in our study between blood-circulating AMH and inhibin B levels. A close correlation was also observed after adjustment for serum FSH concentrations and age. Furthermore, serum inhibin B and serum AMH levels were positively correlated with total sperm count and sperm concentration. This relationship remained even after adjustment for age and serum FSH levels. Accordingly, serum AMH values are a reliable marker for both Sertoli cells and exocrine testicular functions and can thus be a good marker of spermatogenesis in adult men. The association between circulating AMH levels and semen quality has been assessed previously, but the results are divergent. Similar to our finding, a significant positive relationship between serum AMH and total sperm count was described previously. However, others have reported no significant association between serum AMH levels and semen characteristics.

The New Potential Function of AMH on the Regulation of FSH Secretion

We also found an interesting significant negative correlation between serum FSH and both serum AMH and inhibin B, which conforms with data from other studies. This significant relationship remained after adjusting for age and serum inhibin B levels. In seeking a possible functional explanation for the negative correlation that we observed between circulating AMH levels and serum FSH concentrations, we explored the expression of the AMH-R2 in human gonadotroph cells. Interestingly, to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to document AMH-R2 expression in gonadotropic cells of an adult man's pituitary gland. The role of AMH in the regulation of gonadotropin secretion has been previously investigated in many preclinical studies. AMH has been reported to activate β-LH and β-FSH gene expression in LβT2 cells, a murine gonadotroph-derived cell line. Similarly, AMH was found to stimulate FSH secretion in rats in vivo; however, such stimulation was restricted to prepubertal female rats. In both male and female mice, AMH increases gonadotropin-releasing hormone–dependent LH pulsatility and secretion. In adult men, like inhibin B but to a lesser degree, AMH may contribute to the classical feedback loop of the pituitary-gonadal axis to decrease FSH secretion by modulating gonadotropic cell activity in the pituitary gland. Nevertheless, further in vitro experiments using isolated human gonadotropic cells are needed to elucidate whether AMH can regulate FSH secretion.

### Effects of gonadotrophin-releasing hormone outside the hypothalamic-pituitary-reproductive axis [^228d7361]. Journal of Neuroendocrinology (2009). Low credibility.

Gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) is a hypothalamic decapeptide with an undisputed role as a primary regulator of gonadal function. It exerts this regulation by controlling the release of gonadotrophins. However, it is becoming apparent that GnRH may have a variety of other vital roles in normal physiology. A reconsideration of the potential widespread action that this traditional reproductive hormone exerts may lead to the generation of novel therapies and provide insight into seemingly incongruent outcomes from current treatments using GnRH analogues to combat diseases such as prostate cancer.

### Sex-specific regulation of inflammation and metabolic syndrome in obesity [^d6ed7801]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2020). Medium credibility.

Additionally, to gain more insight into what specific features of the metabolic syndrome drive the observed associations with circulating adipokines and cytokines, we individually evaluated the 5 parameters defining metabolic syndrome. We showed that circulating triglycerides concentration seem to be the most important condition driving the sex-specific association. In women with high TGs, adiponectin levels are lower, whereas in men with high TGs, plasma IL6 is higher. In addition, also the augmented cytokine production capacity of PBMCs in men with metabolic syndrome is mainly dependent on the presence of high TGs. Further lipidomic analyses showed that this differential effect is not because of sex-differences in the composition of circulating lipoproteins. Following high-fat loads, circulating triglycerides are associated with circulating cytokine levels such as IL-6 and with activation of circulating innate immune cells. However, it is currently unclear why triglycerides are associated with higher IL-6 and higher cytokine production capacity only in men.

As has been shown previously that for example testosterone can have immunomodulatory effect, we tested the hypothesis that circulating hormones contribute to the observed sex-specific differences in inflammatory parameters by measuring the serum concentrations of 5 circulating steroid hormones, of which 4 show strong differential concentrations in men and women, including 17-OH-progesteron and testosterone. For these hormones, we did not observe any differential association with triglycerides or the metabolic syndrome nor an association with circulating cytokines and cytokine-production capacity that could explain our findings. It is important to realize that we were only able to test a selection of hormones and that we cannot exclude effects of progesterone or estrogens. Also, though changes in sex hormones with the metabolic syndrome do not explain the observed sex differences, contrasting baseline levels of steroid hormones between women and men might still play a role these differences (Table XIX in the).

### The language of glioblastoma: a tale of cytokines and sex hormones communication [^a5721a19]. Neuro-Oncology Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Glioblastoma (GB) is the most aggressive and frequent tumor in the central nervous system and, in humans, represents the worst prognosis for cancer. GB develops a very complex microenvironment, recruiting and interacting with a variety of cells and soluble factors, including immune cells, cytokines, and sex hormones, that contribute to GB survival and progression. Recent evidence has shown a crosstalk between cytokine and sex hormone signaling in GB. This communication could provide GB resistance to treatments and malignancy. Then, how GB orchestrates this communication is a matter of interest. For instance, a critical interaction between tumor necrosis factor-beta (TGF-β) and estrogen receptor signaling has been reported in regulating epithelial-mesenchymal transition, an essential step in GB progression. Furthermore, an inhibition of TGF-β signaling by androgen receptor has been reported to promote GB tumorigenesis in men. Conversely, it has been described that cytokines regulate steroid hormone production in different organs, and this mechanism could be involved in GB development and progression. All these data suggest an intercommunication between the immune and endocrine systems in the tumor microenvironment. Thus, in this review, we focus on explaining the knowledge about this critical intercommunication system and its implication in GB progression.

### Production of 11-oxygenated androgens by testicular adrenal rest tumors [^4f82480c]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Reduced fertility in 21OHD men with TART is considered to be associated with mechanical obstruction of the seminiferous tubules. In addition to the mechanical effects, adrenal-derived androgens likely contribute to the suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, as suggested by the suppressed gonadotropins in men with poorly controlled 21OHD, and by the inverse correlation of 11KT with T in reproductive age men (as opposed to the direct correlation of these 2 steroids in females and pre-pubertal boys). Hypothetically, the local (adrenal-like) steroid production by TART might have paracrine effects on healthy testicular tissue, impairing the normal gonadal function.

To study whether steroid production by TART translated into elevated circulating concentrations in 21OHD patients, the peripheral blood steroid levels from 21OHD patients were compared with matched controls. Whereas the levels of all 4 11oxC19 androgens were previously found to be increased in peripheral plasma of 21OHD patients, these 11oxC19 androgens were not elevated in the peripheral blood samples of 21OHD patients in this study cohort. This discrepancy might be explained by the smaller sample size of this study or, more likely, the partially suppressive effect of dexamethasone, which was required as stress medication in this study. As this dose was given immediately prior to surgery, the suppressive effect of dexamethasone was delayed, which is confirmed by the elevation of peripheral steroid concentrations in men with 21OHD vs those with history of adrenalectomy (only testicular contribution) and by the trend of slightly lower steroid concentrations in the spermatic veins cannulated last vs those cannulated first (described in Claahsen-van der Grinten et al). Although this suggests a very small effect of dexamethasone on the negative feedback-loop, this trend demonstrates the existence of kinetics and ACTH-responsiveness of steroid production, confirming that adrenal-like ACTH-sensitive steroid production was not completely suppressed. We could not measure plasma ACTH in the peripheral serum samples obtained during spermatic vein sampling to demonstrate the degree of ACTH suppression at that time. The peripheral steroid hormone concentrations in these men with 21OHD acutely treated with dexamethasone were lower compared to a previously described cohort of men with 21OHD during conventional therapy. This finding is most likely due to the clinically required dexamethasone dose just prior to spermatic vein sampling, given the generally poor hormonal control of both cohorts (Table 1). The preoperative dexamethasone in this study is a limitation but suggests that the spermatic vein gradients might have been even greater if dexamethasone was not administered. In agreement with previous findings, the peripheral levels of the upstream 11oxC21 steroids, 21dF, and 11OHP, were higher in patients with 21OHD than in unaffected individuals. The comparison of peripheral serum steroid concentrations in 21OHD men to healthy control men is, however, limited because of the dexamethasone stress medication given only to the men with 21OHD. Thus, although it is difficult to quantitate the proportions of peripheral steroids coming from TART vs adrenals, our findings suggest that TART contribute to the production of 11-oxygenated steroids.

### Combined inhibition of types I and II 5 α-reductase selectively augments the basal (nonpulsatile) mode of testosterone secretion in young men [^e59f6feb]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2005). Low credibility.

Context

Testosterone (Te) is metabolized in the hypothalamus and pituitary gland, where untransformed steroid and activated products participate in feedback regulation of GnRH and LH secretion. Genetic inactivation of 5 alpha-reductase type I remains undescribed clinically, whereas deficiency of the type II isoenzyme elevates both LH and Te concentrations.

Objective

The aim of this study was to test the combined feedback contribution of 5 alpha-reduced steroids. SETTING/DESIGN/INTERVENTION: In a university setting, nine young men received placebo and a dual (type I/type II) 5 alpha-reductase inhibitor, dutasteride.

Methods/Outcomes

LH and Te dynamics were assessed by: 1) 10-min blood sampling for 26 h; 2) GnRH stimulation (100 ng/kg iv); 3) discrete peak detection; 4) deconvolution analysis; 5) cosinor analyses of 24-h rhythmicity; and 6) pattern regularity.

Results

Compared with placebo, dutasteride lowered 5 alpha-dihydro Te concentrations by 80% (P = 0.009), but did not alter any measure of LH dynamics. Conversely, dutasteride augmented: 1) total, bioavailable and free Te concentrations (0.002 < P < 0.032) without changing estradiol or SHBG concentrations; 2) nadir Te concentrations (P = 0.025); and 3) basal (P = 0.013) and thereby total (basal plus pulsatile) (P = 0.003) Te secretion.

Conclusion

Combined antagonism of types I and II 5 alpha-reductase preferentially drives nonpulsatile Te secretion in healthy men. The concomitant stability of LH outflow could indicate that intragonadal 5 alpha-reduced androgens repress basal Leydig-cell steroidogenesis.

### Pituitary gonadotropin-releasing hormone II as a possible mediator of positive estrogen feedback [^e9228ec6]. Journal of Neuroendocrinology (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

The role that luteinizing hormone (LH) plays in controlling ovarian function is already well established. For example, in female primates the pulsatile release of this glycoprotein from the adenohypophysis is known to stimulate the ovarian production of estrogens. Furthermore, during the late follicular phase of the primate menstrual cycle, a surge of LH serves as the primary humoral trigger for ovulation to occur. On the other hand, the neuroendocrine factors that regulate the pulsatile and surge modes of LH from pituitary gonadotropes are less clear, especially in humans and nonhuman primates. For many years it was assumed that pulsatile release of gonadotropin‐releasing hormone (GNRH) from the hypothalamus was sufficient to stimulate both the tonic and surge modes of LH release, depending on the level of estrogen in circulation. Later studies involving direct measurement of GNRH concentrations in the medial basal hypothalamus (or in the third ventricle) showed that primates, like rodents and sheep, release GNRH as a large surge at the time of ovulation. These findings gave added credence to the idea that GNRH plays a dual role in regulating the human menstrual cycle: (1) During the early follicular phase of the cycle, pulsatile GNRH stimulates ovarian estrogen production, which in turn exerts negative feedback on the GNRH‐producing cells; (2) during the late follicular phase of the cycle, the rising estrogen concentrations exert positive feedback on the GNRH‐producing cells causing them to release the peptide as a large surge, which in turn stimulates a preovulatory surge of LH.

### An expert perspective on phosphate dysregulation with a focus on chronic hypophosphatemia [^77ad1f85]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Phosphate: Role and Regulation

Role and requirements through life

Phosphorus (in the form of organic phosphate) is an essential component of cell membranes, proteins, nucleic acids, bones, and teeth, as well as having roles in the structure and function of smooth and skeletal muscles. Phosphorus‐containing compounds are also involved in the storage and release of metabolic energy (via adenosine triphosphate[ATP]), cell signaling, and normal acid–base balance.

Phosphate requirements vary with age and sex because of changing developmental and physiologic needs (Table 1). The age‐associated decline in serum phosphate levels, more predominantly shown in men after middle age, reflects changes in renal tubular phosphate reabsorption postulated by age‐dependent changes in tubular phosphate handling or levels of hormonal modulators (eg, PTH, phosphatonins, and growth hormone).

Table 1
Reference Ranges for Serum Phosphate

Regulation of phosphate homeostasis

Under normal conditions, phosphate levels are maintained by a balance between dietary phosphate intake with appropriate intestinal absorption, renal phosphate excretion through changes in renal tubular reabsorption, and the transcellular movement of phosphate between intracellular fluid and bones (Fig. 1). These processes are regulated via multiple endocrine negative feedback loops involving FGF23, PTH, and 1,25(OH) 2 D (Fig. 2). Briefly, FGF23 is a key regulator of phosphate homeostasis and vitamin D metabolism that controls renal phosphate absorption and excretion. Under physiologic conditions, FGF23 is produced by osteocytes and osteoblasts in response to high phosphate intake, elevated serum phosphate levels, or elevated 1,25(OH) 2 D. PTH is released from the parathyroid glands in response to low calcium levels and/or high phosphate in the blood, resulting in the production of 1,25(OH) 2 D and, potentially, FGF23. In contrast, 1,25(OH) 2 D increases in response to low plasma phosphate and potentiates the capacity of the gut to absorb dietary phosphate. Maintenance of phosphate homeostasis is important throughout life as phosphate dysregulation can lead to hyperphosphatemia or hypophosphatemia, with potentially fatal complications if untreated.

### Interpretation of reproductive hormones before, during and after the pubertal transition-identifying health and disordered puberty [^570da8ed]. Clinical Endocrinology (2021). Medium credibility.

Each GnRH pulse stimulates a pulse of LH, but FSH pulses are less clearly correlated with GnRH release, due to the longer circulatory half‐life of FSH. LH is secreted rapidly in response to a bolus of GnRH from pre‐existing pools of LH, leading to a rise in circulating LH within minutes, as well as more slowly after further LH processing. There is also a differential sensitivity between LH and FSH response to GnRH, such that a partial decrease in the activity of the GnRHR can lead to reduced LH and sex steroid hormone production with relatively preserved FSH concentrations. While stimulation by GnRH in an intermittent or pulsatile manner leads to increased gonadotropin secretion, a continuous infusion of GnRH results in a decrease in LH and FSH secretion and a downregulation of the GnRH receptors on the pituitary gonadotrope cells. These alterations in the GnRH receptor have an important role in regulating gonadotrope function.

FSH and LH are glycoproteins that share an identical α‐subunit but have distinct 115 amino acid long β‐subunits that confer specificity. There are a small number of published cases of mutations in the gonadotropin‐specific β‐subunits, including an inactivating mutation of beta LH causing pubertal failure with the absence of Leydig cells of the testes, in contrast to inactivating mutations of beta FSH, which lead to lack of follicular maturation and amenorrhoea in females and failure of spermatogenesis in males, although there is some phenotypic variability. Pubertal maturation in women, including breast development and menarche (indicating sufficient oestrogen production for a mitogenic action on the breast tissue and endometrium), can occur in a state of LH deficiency, although LH secretion is obligatory for ovulation. These observations imply that LH is essential for the maturation of Leydig cells and steroidogenesis in men and that its primary role in women is to induce ovulation(Table 1).

### A mechanical'hypothalamus' for ovulation induction therapy… [^f6cf5534]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

In the normal menstrual cycle, the functional integrity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis requires the pulsatile secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone from the hypothalamus. This hypothalamic hormone, also known as luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone, stimulates pituitary gonadotropin secretion, promoting ovarian follicular maturation, ovulation, and corpus luteum function. 1, 2 When the hypothalamus fails to provide an appropriate GnRH stimulation of the pituitary gland, anovulatory infertility often occurs. Recent advances in neuroendocrine physiology demonstrate that pulsatile GnRH replacement therapy can restore ovulation and fertility. Infertility specialists are learning how to provide pulsatile GnRH therapy for the treatment of hypothalamic hypogonadism in both men and women.

3–5 Recent evidence also suggests that higher-dose pulsatile GnRH treatment may be used to achieve multiple follicular growth for in vitro fertilization therapy, when the collection of several mature oocytes is desired.

### Unusual suspects: glial cells in fertility regulation and their suspected role in polycystic ovary syndrome [^fd257589]. Journal of Neuroendocrinology (2022). Medium credibility.

2 DO GLIAL CELLS PLAY A ROLE IN FERTILITY REGULATION?

Fertility is controlled by a small population of brain cells known as GnRH neurons (Figure 1A). GnRH neurons secrete pulses of GnRH peptide into the pituitary portal system to drive the pulsatile release of LH and follicle‐stimulating hormone (FSH) from the pituitary gland. LH and FSH then act on the gonads to stimulate the production of gametes and sex steroid hormones in a sexually dimorphic manner. In females, once per reproductive cycle, GnRH secretion is increased in a surge pattern that triggers a preovulatory LH surge leading to ovulation. Circulating concentrations of sex steroid hormones are then conveyed to GnRH neurons; however, GnRH neurons do not express the sex steroids receptors that are essential for the feedback regulation of the HPG axis. Positive and negative sex steroid hormone feedback has been shown to occur in part through a synaptically‐connected neuronal network commonly referred to as the 'GnRH neuronal network'. In addition, evidence supports an important role for glial cells in the relay of sex steroid feedback onto GnRH neurons. Sex hormones influence glial cell morphology, number and function throughout life in different brain regions. However, whether or not glial cells express sex steroid receptors depends on the glial cell type, the brain region and the physiological or pathological state of the animal studied. In addition, glial cells have been shown to change their morphology and their secretome depending on external (light/season) and other internal (energy balance) cues, as well as to interact/communicate with GnRH neurons, therefore positioning them as important modulators of the central regulation of the HPG axis (Figure 1A).

### Testosterone (Striant) [^32af8863]. FDA (2009). Low credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Striant®delivers physiologic amounts of testosterone to the systemic circulation, thereby producing circulating testosterone concentrations in hypogonadal males that approximate physiologic levels seen in healthy young men (300–1050 ng/dL).

Testosterone - General Androgen Effects

Endogenous androgens, including testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) are responsible for the normal growth and development of the male sex organs and for maintenance of secondary sex characteristics. These effects include the growth and maturation of prostate, seminal vesicles, penis, and scrotum; the development of male hair distribution, such as facial, pubic, chest, and axillary hair; laryngeal enlargement, vocal chord thickening, and alterations in body musculature and fat distribution. Testosterone and DHT are necessary for the normal development of secondary sex characteristics.

Male hypogonadism results from insufficient production of testosterone and is characterized by low serum testosterone concentrations. Symptoms associated with male hypogonadism include impotence and decreased sexual desire, fatigue and loss of energy, mood depression, regression of secondary sexual characteristics and osteoporosis. Hypogonadism is a risk factor for osteoporosis in men.

Drugs in the androgen class also promote retention of nitrogen, sodium, potassium, phosphorus, and decreased urinary excretion of calcium. Androgens have been reported to increase protein anabolism and decrease protein catabolism. Nitrogen balance is improved only when there is sufficient intake of calories and protein.

Androgens are responsible for the growth spurt of adolescence and for the eventual termination of linear growth brought about by fusion of the epiphyseal growth centers. In children, exogenous androgens accelerate linear growth rates but may cause a disproportionate advancement in bone maturation. Use by children and adolescents over long periods may result in fusion of the epiphyseal growth centers and termination of the growth process. Androgens have been reported to stimulate the production of red blood cells by enhancing the production of erythropoietin.

During exogenous administration of androgens, endogenous testosterone release may be inhibited through feedback inhibition of pituitary luteinizing hormone (LH). At large doses of exogenous androgens, spermatogenesis may also be suppressed through feedback inhibition of pituitary follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH).

### Esterified estrogens (Menest) [^b8afb979]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Endogenous estrogens are largely responsible for the development and maintenance of the female reproductive system and secondary sexual characteristics. Although circulating estrogens exist in a dynamic equilibrium of metabolic interconversions, estradiol is the principal intracellular human estrogen and is substantially more potent than its metabolites, estrone and estriol, at the receptor level.

The primary source of estrogen in normally cycling adult women is the ovarian follicle, which secrets 70 to 500 mcg of estradiol daily, depending on the phase of the menstrual cycle. After menopause, most endogenous estrogen is produced by conversion of androstenedione, secreted by the adrenal cortex, to estrone by the peripheral tissues. Thus, estrone and the sulfate conjugated form, estrone sulfate, are the most abundant circulating estrogens in postmenopausal women.

Estrogens act through binding to nuclear receptors in estrogen-responsive tissues. To date, two estrogen receptors have been identified. These vary in proportion from tissue to tissue.

Circulating estrogens modulate the pituitary secretion of the gonadotropins, luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), through a negative feedback mechanism. Estrogens act to reduce the elevated levels of these hormones seen in postmenopausal women.

Distribution

The distribution of exogenous estrogens is similar to that of endogenous estrogens. Estrogens are widely distributed in the body and are generally found in higher concentrations in the sex hormone target organs. Estrogens circulate in the blood largely bound to sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) and albumin.

Metabolism

Exogenous estrogens are metabolized in the same manner as endogenous estrogens. Circulating estrogens exist in a dynamic equilibrium of metabolic interconversions. These transformations take place mainly in the liver. Estradiol is converted reversibly to estrone, and both can be converted to estriol, which is the major urinary metabolite. Estrogens also undergo enterohepatic recirculation via sulfate and glucuronide conjugation in the liver, biliary secretion of conjugates into the intestine, and hydrolysis in the gut followed by reabsorption. In postmenopausal women, a significant proportion of the circulating estrogens exist as sulfate conjugates, especially estrone sulfate, which serves as a circulating reservoir for the formulation of more active estrogens.

Excretion

Estradiol, estrone, and estriol are excreted in the urine along with glucuronide and sulfate conjugates.

Expanding modes of action of hormonal treatments

As PCa is a largely hormone-driven tumor, understanding the androgen signaling pathway, its role in cell growth, and identification of vulnerable points for manipulation is important when evaluating pharmacological treatments. The centralized hormonal control of T production was the first element of the pathway to be investigated. T secretion is initiated in the hypothalamus with pulsatile release of LHRH, followed by binding to, and stimulation of, LHRH receptors in the anterior pituitary gland that cause the release of luteinizing (LH) and follicle-stimulating (FSH) hormones. LH stimulates receptors on Leydig cells in the testes to induce production of T. Suppression of this hypothalamic−pituitary−gonadal axis is the mechanism by which LHRH agonists (also referred to as gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)) and antagonists reduce circulating T levels (Fig. 1).

Fig. 1
Mechanisms of androgen signaling inhibition

Inhibition of enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of T is an additional therapeutic target. T is a steroid hormone that is derived from cholesterol through a cascade of biochemical reactions. The final steps of biosynthesis involve the enzymes 17α-hydroxylase and C17,20-lyase that convert the precursors pregnenolone into the weaker androgen dehydroepiandrosterone, and progesterone into androstenedione. These enzymes are normally found in the testes and adrenal glands; however, some PCa cells can synthesize them and produce T outside of the control of the normal regulatory mechanisms. With effective inhibition of these enzymes, biosynthesis of T at all sites can be prevented (Fig. 1).

Additionally, the AR signaling pathway can be directly inhibited by antiandrogen molecules that prevent binding of androgen to the AR. In PCa cells, DHT binds to the AR in the cytoplasm, causing activated protein to translocate to the nucleus where it promotes the transcription of genes that regulate cell growth and survival. The AR binds directly to the promotor of genes at the AR element. Antiandrogens such as enzalutamide and apalutamide bind to the AR in the cytoplasm, disrupt the interaction between androgens and the AR thus preventing translocation of the AR into the nucleus and subsequent binding to DNA (Fig. 1). Enzalutamide may also interact with coactivator function at the DNA binding site to prevent transcription.

Therefore, in patients with CRPC, there are multiple pharmacological routes through which the PCa cell can be deprived of androgenic stimulation, thereby preventing tumor cell growth and providing clinical benefit.

### The fetal programming effect of prenatal smoking on igf1r and igf1 methylation is organ-and sex-specific [^a5fcd2c7]. Epigenetics (2017). Low credibility.

We also found organ-specific Igf1r and Igf1 gene expression with higher levels in lung than in liver. This indicates their organ-specific production and suggests local regulation. Our findings are in accordance with those that found that deletion of hepatic Igf1 in mice leaves its local production in other tissues unaffected. When comparing fetuses and neonates, we observed an increase of hepatic Igf1 expression accompanied by simultaneous increase of Igf1r. Together with the stable amount of Igf1 in lung, this may indicate the onset of a hepatic secretory function, as Igf1 gene expression was shown to gradually increase from fetal day 18 onwards to postnatal age, thus establishing its role in postnatal development. PSE seems to interfere with these observations, considering the reduced Igf1 mRNA levels in neonatal lung.

We also showed that PSE affects gene expression primarily in male offspring. The predominant impact was observed in liver. Various in vivo studies on organ-specific Igf1 gene expression showed its dependence on steroid hormone actions (e.g.). Sexually dimorphic responses to PSE were described in human fetal liver and suggest that, dependent on sex, different pathways may be affected but may converge in the same disease outcome. Interestingly, sex-specific methylation patterns were also affected by testosterone in selected organs, which in turn influenced gene expression. These findings match our observation of higher baseline Igf1 gene expression in lung of male fetuses for the reasons discussed above. Albeit the moderate effect of PSE on Igf1r and Igf1 gene expression, strong correlations in both organs suggest a mutual regulation. Igf1 mediates its effects by exclusively interacting with Igf1r, which suggests a feedback loop in lung and liver at both analyzed time points. A high susceptibility to smoke-induced deregulation appears reasonable and is suggested by the disturbance of the described correlations by PSE.

### The biological basis of sex differences in athletic performance: consensus statement for the American College of Sports Medicine [^e214f76c]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2023). High credibility.

American College of Sports Medicine consensus on sex differences in athletic performance — Biological sex is a primary determinant of athletic performance because of fundamental sex differences in anatomy and physiology dictated by sex chromosomes and sex hormones. Adult men are typically stronger, more powerful, and faster than women of similar age and training status, and for events relying on endurance, muscle strength, speed, and power, males typically outperform females by 10%–30% depending on the requirements of the event. These sex differences in performance emerge with the onset of puberty and coincide with the increase in endogenous sex steroid hormones, particularly testosterone in males, which increases 30-fold by adulthood, but remains low in females. The review highlights differences in anatomy and physiology, roles of sex steroid hormones, and historical and nonphysiological factors that influence performance and identifies knowledge gaps; a major step toward closing the knowledge gap is to include more and equitable numbers of women to that of men in mechanistic studies that examine any of the sex differences in response to an acute bout of exercise, exercise training, and athletic performance.

Metabolic syndrome and hypertension ‒ Cause of concern

One of the other significant complications of MetS is systemic hypertension, which is characterized by elevated systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), increasing the risk of adverse cardiovascular events. Blood pressure regulation is a closed system with feedback loops that correct any change in blood pressure from normal limits. Blood pressure regulation involves three dynamic systems: vascular tone and endothelial functionality, the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system, and the renin‒angiotensin II‒aldosterone mechanism. There are sex-based differences in blood pressure regulation attributed to the presence of male-specific sex hormones, namely testosterone, and the female sex hormone estrogen. There are also indications that circadian rhythm, quality of sleep, and exercise all play a part in blood pressure regulation. In normal homeostatic subjects, SCFAs produced by the intestinal microbiota activate the cognate receptors GPR41 and olfactory receptor 78 (Olfr78), which can regulate blood pressure. Acetate (one of the SCFAs), binds to GPR41 in vascular endothelial cells and induces calcium release, promoting vasodilation. SCFAs can also directly modulate sympathetic nervous activity via GPR41, thus reducing blood pressure. SCFA exerts anti-inflammatory effects through the modulation of T reg action, reducing proinflammatory cytokine production, which improves endothelial functionality and maintains insulin sensitivity. Insulin-stimulated nitric oxide release plays a significant role in maintaining vasodilation and blood pressure. SCFAs, especially butyrate, reduce the levels of ROS, improving endothelial function. SCFA, acetate via GPCR ligands, suppress IL-1 and renin‒angiotensin‒aldosterone system, reducing blood pressure. Microbiome-produced indole metabolites such as indole-3-acetic acid and indole-3-propionic acid improve vascular endothelial cell functionality and reduce blood pressure. The adipokines/batokines generated by WAT or BAT can also regulate endothelial functionality and thus blood pressure. In peri-vascular adipose tissue, one of the earliest discovered adipokines, adiponectin, can increase vasodilation via nitric oxide synthesis, which is mediated by the adiponectin-AMPK-eNOS pathway, and regulates blood pressure. Leptin, another adipokine proportional to fat mass, can influence the sympathetic nervous system.

estriol, at the receptor level.

The primary source of estrogen in normally cycling adult women is the ovarian
follicle, which secrets 70 to 500mcg of estradiol daily, depending on the phase
of the menstrual cycle. After menopause, most endogenous estrogen is produced by
conversion of androstenedione, secreted by the adrenal cortex, to estrone by the
peripheral tissues. Thus, estrone and the sulfate conjugated form, estrone
sulfate, are the most abundant circulating estrogens in postmenopausal
women.

Estrogens act through binding to nuclear receptors in estrogen-responsive
tissues. To date, two estrogen receptors have been identified. These vary in
proportion from tissue to tissue.

Circulating estrogens modulate the pituitary secretion of the gonadotropins,
luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), through a
negative feedback mechanism. Estrogens act to reduce the elevated levels of
these hormones seen in postmenopausal women.

Distribution

The distribution of exogenous estrogens is similar to that of
endogenous estrogens. Estrogens are widely distributed in the body and are
generally found in higher concentrations in the sex hormone target organs.
Estrogens circulate in the blood largely bound to sex hormone binding globulin
(SHBG) and albumin.

Metabolism

Exogenous estrogens are metabolized in the same manner as
endogenous estrogens. Circulating estrogens exist in a dynamic equilibrium of
metabolic interconversions. These transformations take place mainly in the
liver. Estradiol is converted reversibly to estrone, and both can be converted
to estriol, which is the major urinary metabolite. Estrogens also undergo
enterohepatic recirculation via sulfate and glucuronide conjugation in the
liver, biliary secretion of conjugates into the intestine, and hydrolysis in the
gut followed by reabsorption. In postmenopausal women, a significant proportion
of the circulating estrogens exist as sulfate conjugates, especially estrone
sulfate, which serves as a circulating reservoir for the formulation of more
active estrogens.

Excretion

Estradiol, estrone, and estriol are excreted in the urine along
with glucuronide and sulfate conjugates.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Endogenous androgens are responsible for normal growth and development of the male sex organs and for maintenance of secondary sex characteristics. These effects include growth and maturation of the prostate, seminal vesicles, penis, and scrotum; development of male hair distribution, such as beard, pubic, chest, and axillary hair; laryngeal enlargement, vocal cord thickening, and alterations in body musculature and fat distribution. Drugs in this class also cause retention of nitrogen, sodium, potassium, and phosphorus, and decreased urinary excretion of calcium. Androgens have been reported to increase protein anabolism and decrease protein catabolism. Nitrogen balance is improved only when there is sufficient intake of calories and protein.

Androgens are responsible for the growth spurt of adolescence and for eventual termination of linear growth, brought about by fusion of the epiphyseal growth centers. In children, exogenous androgens accelerate linear growth rates, but may cause disproportionate advancement in bone maturation. Use over long periods may result in fusion of the epiphyseal growth centers and termination of the growth process. Androgens have been reported to stimulate production of red blood cells by enhancing production of erythropoietic stimulation factor.

During exogenous administration of androgens, endogenous testosterone release is inhibited through feedback inhibition of pituitary luteinizing hormone (LH). At large doses of exogenous androgens, spermatogenesis may also be suppressed through feedback inhibition of pituitary follicle stimulating hormone (FSH).

There is a lack of substantial evidence that androgens are effective in fractures, surgery, convalescence, and functional uterine bleeding.

### Selective modulation of the keratoconic stromal microenvironment by FSH and LH [^a74971ef]. The American Journal of Pathology (2023). Medium credibility.

We have long posited that hormone imbalances play a vital role in the onset and progression of KC and have found significant changes in plasma and salivary androgens and estrogens in KC patients when compared to their healthy counterparts. More recently, reports of modulation in levels of gonadotropins — follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) — in KC in vivo, as well as modulation of their receptors (FSHR and LHR) in vitro, suggested upstream hormone dysregulation. The discovery of a hormone-regulated, robust biomarker, prolactin-induced protein, supports the hypothesis that hormones play a crucial role in KC pathogenesis.

FSH and LH are hormones essential for the growth, development, and maturation of the human reproductive system. They stimulate the gonads in both males (testes) and females (ovaries). Gonadotropins are produced by gonadotropic cells in the anterior pituitary gland in response to gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) secreted by the hypothalamus. Regulation of gonadotropins involves positive and negative feedback loops between the different components of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, in which circulating gonad-derived sex hormones act at the level of the hypothalamus and anterior pituitary to modulate the release or inhibition of hypothalamic GnRH and anterior pituitary gonadotropins (FSH and LH).FSH and LH are large glycoproteins composed of α and β subunits; the β subunit is unique to each hormone, having the capacity to bind to its own receptor. By puberty, a crucial period in KC manifestation, gonadotropin secretion in boys promotes sperm production by FSH and testosterone secretion by LH in the testes. In girls, gonadotropins are released cyclically, wherein FSH stimulates ovarian follicle growth and estrogen release in the ovaries, and an LH surge stimulates ovulation and progesterone secretion.

### Regulation of bone turnover by sex steroids in men [^6286a9d1]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2008). Low credibility.

Introduction

The mechanism(s) by which sex steroids regulate bone turnover in humans are unclear, and recent studies have suggested that follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) may play an important role in regulating bone resorption.

Materials and Methods

Fifty-nine men (median age, 69 yr) underwent suppression of sex steroids using a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist and aromatase blocker and were replaced with testosterone (T; 5 mg/d) and estradiol (E; 37.5 microg/d). After assessment of bone resorption markers (serum C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen [CTX] and TRACP5b), they were randomized to sex steroid deficiency (-T, -E), E alone (-T, +E), T alone (+T, -E), or both (+T, +E) and restudied 3 wk later. Bone marrow aspirates were obtained to isolate osteoblastic, T, and monocytic cells using magnetic-activated cell sorting.

Results

Serum CTX and TRACP5b increased significantly (by 71% and 15%, p < 0.01 and < 0.001, respectively) in the -T, -E group, and these increases occurred despite a 60% suppression of serum FSH levels (p < 0.001) caused by the GnRH agonist. There were significant E (but not T) effects on preventing increases in serum CTx and TRACP levels. There was a nonsignificant trend (p = 0.122) for E to suppress RANKL mRNA levels in bone marrow osteoblastic cells. Changes in mRNA levels for other cytokines (TNF-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1alpha, IL-1beta, IL-1ra, IFN-gamma) in bone marrow cells were not significant.

Conclusions

E has greater suppressive effects on bone resorption than T, and increased bone resorption after sex steroid deficiency can occur independently of changes in FSH secretion. E effects on bone resorption may be mediated by regulation of RANKL production by osteoblastic cells, although further studies using more highly purified cells may reduce the variability of the mRNA measurements and allow for clearer definition of the mediators of sex steroid action in vivo.

### Gonadotrophs have a dual origin, with most derived from early postnatal pituitary stem cells [^148af822]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

The reproductive axis comprises the hypothalamus, the pituitary gland and the gonads. While all its components are assembled in the embryo, it only starts to be active postnatally, initially during a transient period known as minipuberty, which is important for future male fertility and cognitive development in both sexes –. Activity will start again at puberty, which marks the onset of reproductive capacity. The hypothalamic gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) has a central regulatory role during these periods. Its pulsatile secretory patterns are regulated by a neuronal network that integrates peripheral signals; it is released in the hypophyseal portal system, through which it reaches the pituitary where it controls production and secretion of luteinizing (LH) and follicle-stimulating (FSH) hormones. The two gonadotrophins act in turn on the gonads, regulating steroid and gamete maturation. Gonadal steroids exert crucial feedback both at the hypothalamic and pituitary level.

Most adult pituitary gonadotrophs produce both LH and FSH. However, the patterns of their secretion differ; LH secretion closely follows GnRH pulses, while FSH does not, and it is regulated by additional peptide hormones. The modalities of LH and FSH regulation are not completely understood, in particular how secretion of LH and FSH is differentially regulated by the same ligand. Adding to this complexity, we reveal here that gonadotrophs comprise a dual population based on different developmental origins.

Gonadotrophs initially arise in the embryonic pituitary. They are amongst the first endocrine cell types to commit, at 12.5dpc in the mouse, in the ventral pituitary primordium, with upregulation of the glycoprotein α, the subunit common to LH, FSH and TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone). LHβ and FSHβ subunits are only expressed from 16.5dpc, which is considered the true gonadotroph birthdate, and GnRH is involved in this, at least in males. Postnatally, gonadotrophs expand dorsally through the gland as a second wave during the first two weeks after birth –.

### Addressing sex as a biological variable in preclinical models of lung disease: an official American Thoracic Society research statement [^29011d81]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Classes of factors causing sex differences — sex chromosomes and gonadal hormones both contribute to lung disease differences. The sex chromosomes cause the development of different gonads in the two sexes, which secrete different gonadal hormones that act throughout the body, and many actions of gonadal hormones are reversible, but some are long-lasting. The sex chromosomes can also act directly on nongonadal tissues, including the lung, to cause sex differences, and one goal is to differentiate the effects of gonadal hormones and sex chromosomes in driving sex differences in lung disease, with the aim of identifying molecular pathways that could serve as therapeutic targets.

### Interpretation of reproductive hormones before, during and after the pubertal transition-identifying health and disordered puberty [^55e90468]. Clinical Endocrinology (2021). Medium credibility.

2.4 Dynamic hormonal changes during pubertal maturation

After periods of activity of the HPG axis in utero, and then during mini‐puberty, the axis becomes dormant between the ages of approximately 2 and 8–9 years (Figure 2). The suppression of the axis is not absolute as LH pulsatility is detectable during this stage using ultrasensitive assays, but pulses are of low amplitude and infrequent. Likewise, testosterone and estradiol are measurable in the circulation using sensitive assays, thus demonstrating low but definite activity of the prepubertal gonads. Notably, serum gonadotropin concentrations are low in early‐mid childhood in the majority of children with gonadal disorders, demonstrating that it is central inhibition rather than negative feedback from sex steroid production that suppresses gonadotropin secretion during this period.

The increasing amplitude of GnRH pulses in early puberty leads to the augmentation of nocturnal LH pulses in children, before any physical development of Tanner genital or breast stage 2 can be observed clinically. This period may thus be seen as the hormonal onset of puberty. The difference between daytime and overnight LH concentrations persists until the late stages of puberty. Mean LH and FSH concentrations both increase gradually through pubertal development in concert with sex steroid concentrations, although LH rises to a greater extent, due to differences in feedback mechanisms and sensitivity for these two hormones, as described above. There is both an increase in basal concentrations of LH and FSH and a greater number and amplitude of LH peaks. The negative feedback from gonadal steroids on the hypothalamic–pituitary production of GnRH and gonadotropins develops by mid‐puberty and becomes dominant over the central inhibitory feedback drive.

### Aging in healthy men impairs recombinant human luteinizing hormone (LH)-stimulated testosterone secretion monitored under a two-day intravenous pulsatile LH clamp [^e39e9be9]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2005). Low credibility.

Context

Testosterone (Te) depletion in aging men in principle could reflect deficits in the hypothalamus, pituitary gland, or testis. Available pharmacological studies of possible failure of Leydig cell steroidogenesis remain inconclusive.

Objective

The objective of the study was to assess Te secretion in older and young men in response to near physiological LH stimulation.

Intervention

Pulsatile i.v. infusion of recombinant human LH was administered for 2 d to stimulate Te secretion during suppression of endogenous LH concentrations with a potent selective GnRH receptor antagonist (ganirelix). SUBJECTS/CONTEXT: Healthy older (aged 60–73 yr, n = 8) and young (19–30 yr, n = 13) men were studied in an academic setting.

Measures

Pulsatile LH and Te concentrations on the second day of exogenous LH stimulation were measured.

Results

Serum ganirelix concentrations and infused LH pulse increments were similar by age. In contrast, older subjects manifested: 1) reduced mean Te concentrations (P = 0.016), Te peak heights (P = 0.014), increments (P = 0.010), summed areas (P < 0.013), and interpeak Te concentrations (P = 0.023); 2) decreased Te to LH concentration ratios (P = 0.002); 3) diminished LH-Te feed-forward synchrony (P = 0.020); and 4) a blunted amplitude (P = 0.036) and advanced phase (P = 0.013) of diurnal Te rhythms.

Conclusion

A novel regimen of pulsatile LH stimulation for 48 h during GnRH receptor blockade unmasks deficits in pulsatile, basal, synchronous, and nyctohemeral Te secretion in healthy older men. These findings do not exclude concomitant defects in GnRH outflow and/or Te-negative feedback in the aging male.

### Drug insight: recent advances in male hormonal contraception [^3c299294]. Nature Clinical Practice: Endocrinology & Metabolism (2006). Medium credibility.

As there are limitations to current methods of male contraception, research has been undertaken to develop hormonal contraceptives for men, analogous to the methods for women based on estrogen and progestogens. When testosterone is administered to a man, it functions as a contraceptive by suppressing the secretion of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) from the pituitary gland. Since these hormones are the main stimulatory signals for spermatogenesis, low levels of LH and FSH markedly impair sperm production. After 3–4 months of testosterone treatment, 60–70% of men no longer have sperm in their ejaculate, and most other men exhibit markedly diminished sperm counts. Male hormonal contraception is well tolerated, free of serious adverse side effects, and 95% effective in the prevention of pregnancy. Importantly, male hormonal contraception is reversible, with sperm counts usually recovering within 4 months of the discontinuation of hormone treatment. Because exogenous testosterone administration alone does not completely suppress sperm production in all men, researchers have combined testosterone with second agents, such as progestogens or gonadotropin-releasing-hormone antagonists, to further suppress secretion of LH and FSH and improve suppression of spermatogenesis. Recent trials have used combinations of long-acting injectable or implantable forms of testosterone with progestogens, which can be administered orally, by injection or by a long-acting implant. Such combinations suppress spermatogenesis to zero without severe side effects in 80–90% of men, with near-complete suppression in the remainder of individuals. One of these testosterone and progestogen combination regimens might soon bring the promise of male hormonal contraception to fruition.

### Circulating resistin levels and risk of multiple myeloma in three prospective cohorts [^37b9fa92]. British Journal of Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

This study is, to our knowledge, the first prospective investigation of circulating levels of resistin and risk of MM. Our findings suggest that high pre-diagnosis circulating resistin levels are associated with a reduced future risk of MM development, in particular among men. These results are consistent with findings from a prior hospital-based case–control study. Although we did not find evidence of an association among women, our investigation included relatively few female MM cases and thus we had limited statistical power for this subgroup analysis. Our findings may also reflect true differences by sex in the biological activity of resistin due to interaction with sex or metabolic hormones or other inflammatory markers that are differentially expressed in men and women. We also observed a somewhat stronger association during the time period closer to MM diagnosis, which may reflect altered resistin expression related to onset or progression of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance.

Resistin increases nuclear factor kappa B-related monocyte expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6. Thus, the observed increased risk of MM in males with lower levels of resistin might reflect a compensatory effect of resistin or a negative feedback loop following the production of IL-6 and/or other cytokines with known effects on proliferation and survival of MM cells. Alternatively, previous studies have shown that TNF- α decreases resistin secretion in murine models. If TNF- α, a well-characterised pro-inflammatory cytokine that stimulates MM cell proliferation, also acts as a negative regulator of resistin in humans, this action may explain the observed inverse association between pre-diagnosis resistin levels and MM risk. This hypothesis is corroborated by increased resistin levels in MM patients after treatment with thalidomide, a TNF- α inhibitor.

 will determine the distribution of testosterone between the free and
 bound forms, and the free testosterone concentration will determine its
 half-life.

About 90 percent of a dose of testosterone is excreted as
 glucuronic and sulfuric acid conjugates of testosterone and its
 metabolites; about 6 percent of a dose is excreted in feces, mostly in
 the unconjugated form. Inactivation of testosterone occurs primarily in
 the liver. Testosterone is metabolized to various 17-keto steroids
 through two different pathways. There are considerable variations of the
 half-life as reported in the literature, ranging from 10–100 minutes.

In many tissues the activity of testosterone appears to depend on
 reduction to dihydrotestosterone, which binds to cytosol receptor
 proteins. The steroid-receptor complex is transported to the nucleus
 where it initiates transcription events and cellular changes related to
 androgen action.

### Developmentally delimited emergence of more orderly luteinizing hormone and testosterone secretion during late prepuberty in boys [^3aea274e]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2001). Low credibility.

To quantitate changing feedback control in the GnRH-LH/FSH-testosterone axis in male puberty, we here quantitate the orderliness of hormone release patterns using the regularity (pattern-sensitive) statistic, approximate entropy (ApEn), in 46 eugonadal boys representing 6 genitally defined stages of normal puberty. ApEn is a single variable, model-free, and scale-independent barometer of coordinate signaling or integrative regulation within a coupled neuroendocrine axis. Accordingly, we quantitated ApEn of LH profiles obtained by immunofluorometric assay of sera sampled every 20 min for 24 h. LH ApEn declined remarkably between early prepuberty (genital stage I-A: mean bone age, 4.6 ± 1.6 yr; testis volume, < 3 mL for at least 3 succeeding yr) and late prepuberty (genital stage I-C: bone age, 8.7 ± 1.8 yr; testis volume, < 3 mL for up to 1 yr thereafter; P: = 0.00019), which indicates the acquisition of more regular LH release patterns in late prepuberty. Maximal LH orderliness occurred in puberty stage II (bone age, 10.7 ± 1.0 yr; testis volume, 2.8 ± 0.4 mL). The LH secretory process was more disorderly in mid- and later puberty (Tanner stages III and IV). Transpubertal variations in testosterone ApEn manifested a similar tempo, i.e. the greatest regularity of testosterone secretion (lowest ApEn) emerged in Tanner genital stage II (P: < 10(-)(7)), with less orderly patterns evident both earlier and later in sexual development. In contrast, FSH ApEn values remained invariant of pubertal status. Analysis of bihormonal coupling using the theoretically related bivariate cross-ApEn statistic disclosed maximal 2-hormone synchrony for LH and testosterone secretion in genital stage II (P: = 0.031), with relative deterioration of coordinate LH and testosterone release patterns both before and after. LH and FSH release became maximally synchronous at the end of prepuberty (genital stage I-C; P: = 0.029), and FSH and testosterone synchrony peaked in pubertal stage III (P: = 0.037). As mean 24-h serum concentrations of LH, FSH, and testosterone rose transpubertally by 35-fold (LH), 68-fold (FSH), and 70-fold (testosterone), respectively, we infer that pubertal developmental stage per se rather than level of hormone output dictates coordinate GnRH-LH/FSH-testosterone secretion. In summary, in eugonadal boys, the regularity of 24-h LH and testosterone secretory patterns undergoes well defined pubertal stage-specific control. No sexually developmentally delimited regulation is inferable for FSH. The concept of temporally biphasic puberty-dependent variations in neurohormone secretory regularity contrasts with the unidirectional rise in daily hormone output. Accordingly, we infer that late prepuberty and early puberty (Tanner genital stages IC and II) embody a physiologically unique sexual developmental window, marked by transiently enhanced LH and testosterone feedback stability in boys. Whether analogous plasticity of hypothalamo-pituitary-gonadal interactions unfolds during female adolescence is not known.

### Testosterone therapy in men with hypogonadism: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^399b349b]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). Medium credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for male hypogonadism, more specifically with respect to LH/FSH levels, ES 2018 guidelines recommend to obtain measurement of LH and FSH concentrations in patients with hypogonadism to distinguish between primary (testicular) and secondary (pituitary/hypothalamic) hypogonadism.
