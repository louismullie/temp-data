HPV vaccine

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about HPV vaccination. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical question and PICO framing. Then, I should appraise the evidence hierarchy and classify studies. Next, I will extract and synthesize efficacy, immunogenicity, and safety data by outcome and population. After that, I need to integrate guideline recommendations and weigh benefits versus risks. Finally, I will translate this into practical, age-specific recommendations and highlight uncertainties and future directions, ensuring I continuously verify claims against the best available sources.

> Let me first confirm the clinical question and PICO elements. The overarching question is who should receive HPV vaccination, which vaccine, what schedule, and why, with outcomes including infection, precancerous lesions, cancer, and adverse events. Population spans adolescents and adults, including males, females, and people living with HIV. Interventions include 2-, 4-, and 9-valent vaccines given as 1-, 2-, or 3-dose schedules. Comparators include placebo, other vaccines, or different schedules. Outcomes include persistent HPV infection, CIN2+/CIN3+, cervical and other HPV-attributable cancers, anogenital warts, immunogenicity, and serious adverse events, which I should verify against RCTs, systematic reviews, and population studies [^63e69aab] [^45839215] [^4eb73827].

> Next, I should review the evidence hierarchy and classify sources. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses, especially Cochrane, provide the highest level of evidence for efficacy and safety comparisons, followed by randomized controlled trials, then observational cohort and case-control studies, and finally case series and expert opinion. I need to ensure I weigh population-level effectiveness data alongside RCTs because cancer endpoints are rare and long-term, making observational data essential for real-world impact estimates [^63e69aab] [^45839215] [^4eb73827].

> I will now examine efficacy and immunogenicity by outcome, starting with cervical precancers and cancer. Wait, let me verify the magnitude of benefit. High-certainty evidence shows HPV vaccination reduces CIN3+ by about 74% in those vaccinated at or before age 16, and cervical cancer incidence by about 80% in the same group, with consistent reductions across multiple cohorts and countries. Nonavalent vaccine efficacy against high-grade disease attributable to the five additional types is 96.7% in per-protocol analyses, supporting broader type coverage, and these findings align with earlier RCTs showing near-complete protection against vaccine-type persistent infection when given before exposure [^45839215] [^91fc6e96] [^4eb73827].

> Hold on, I should verify dose-schedule questions because this often drives practice. In adolescents initiating vaccination before age 15, two doses yield noninferior immunogenicity to three doses, and real-world data suggest high effectiveness even with one or two doses when given at younger ages. However, three doses remain indicated for those who start at age 15 or older or who are immunocompromised, and I need to emphasize that immunogenicity bridging supports noninferiority but long-term cancer endpoints are still being accrued for reduced-dose schedules [^68e71260] [^289aee57] [^63e69aab].

> Let me consider males and non-cervical outcomes. Moderate-certainty evidence shows the quadrivalent vaccine reduces external genital lesions and anogenital warts in males, and systematic reviews indicate meaningful efficacy against persistent anogenital HPV16/18 and high-grade anal lesions, especially in HPV-naïve men. I should confirm that these data underpin routine male vaccination recommendations and that the 9-valent vaccine is expected to broaden protection against anal and other HPV-attributable cancers in men [^63e69aab] [^80e7f4af] [^d5e144da].

> I need to check special populations, particularly people living with HIV. Immunogenicity is robust in children and adolescents with HIV, though clinical outcome data are limited and certainty is low. Given higher risks of HPV-related disease, vaccination through age 26 is recommended, and I should note that ongoing studies are evaluating fewer-dose regimens and durability in this group, so recommendations may evolve as more data accrue [^63e69aab] [^531db176].

> Next, I should review safety comprehensively. Serious adverse events are not increased versus comparators across RCTs and large post-licensure surveillance, with the most common effects being injection-site pain, redness, and swelling. A Bayesian network meta-analysis found more systemic adverse events with the bivalent vaccine versus quadrivalent or nonavalent formulations, but no differences in serious adverse events, and CDC monitoring of over 100 million doses shows a reassuring safety profile. I should double-check that this aligns with patient counseling points about expected local reactions and the absence of signals for major safety concerns [^4b2d8083] [^58c29034] [^26c3f334].

> But wait, what about adult vaccination beyond age 26. I should confirm the balance of benefit and cost-effectiveness. Modeling and guideline appraisals indicate minimal incremental benefit and poor cost-effectiveness when extending routine vaccination to adults 27–45, with ACIP adopting shared clinical decision-making rather than a routine recommendation. The ACS explicitly does not endorse routine catch-up in this group due to low effectiveness and limited cancer prevention potential, so I need to ensure I frame this as individualized discussion rather than a blanket recommendation [^daa0364b] [^dbc9f0d9] [^b3a076c1].

> I will now integrate guideline positions to ensure consistency. ACIP recommends routine vaccination at age 11–12, starting as early as 9, with catch-up through age 26 for all persons, and shared decision-making for some adults 27–45. ACOG aligns with ACIP and emphasizes strong clinician recommendation and catch-up through 26. The ACS encourages starting at 9–12 to maximize on-time completion and cancer prevention, and does not endorse routine vaccination beyond 26, which I should reinforce in counseling about diminishing returns with age [^17949483] [^cd759357] [^b3a076c1].

> Let me translate this into practical, age-specific recommendations. For ages 9–14, a 2-dose schedule at 0 and 6–12 months is preferred if initiated before the 15th birthday, with the option to start at 9–10 to improve series completion. For ages 15–26, use a 3-dose schedule at 0, 1–2, and 6 months, and do not restart if delayed. For adults 27–45, engage in shared decision-making considering sexual risk, prior exposure likelihood, and limited incremental benefit, and avoid routine vaccination beyond 45. I should confirm that no prevaccination testing is needed and that pregnancy is a temporary deferral, not a contraindication [^68e71260] [^16aff043] [^0da03180].

> Hold on, I should verify vaccine product considerations. In the U.S., only the 9-valent vaccine is distributed, covering HPV 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58, which prevents about 92% of HPV-attributable cancers. Nonavalent efficacy against disease due to the five additional types is high, and immunogenicity bridging supports noninferiority to quadrivalent for shared types, which supports using the 9-valent formulation for all eligible recipients [^f572aa2d] [^91fc6e96] [^1687e738].

> I should double-check implementation pearls that affect uptake. Strong, presumptive clinician recommendation is the single most important predictor of vaccination, and addressing safety concerns directly improves acceptance. Real-world data show substantial declines in vaccine-type HPV prevalence and genital warts after program implementation, with herd effects evident even among unvaccinated individuals, reinforcing the public health rationale for adolescent-focused programs [^44d5f11e] [^6b973093] [^68394738].

> Let me reconsider uncertainties and future directions so I don't overstate conclusions. Long-term durability beyond 10 years appears strong, but continued surveillance is warranted, especially for reduced-dose schedules. One-dose regimens are under active investigation and could transform delivery in low-resource settings, and ongoing trials are evaluating use in immunocompromised hosts, postpartum populations, and for preventing oropharyngeal cancer, so recommendations may evolve as these data mature [^186c9610] [^0feb41c2] [^45839215].

> In summary, I need to ensure the bottom line is clear and evidence-aligned. HPV vaccination is highly effective at preventing infection and HPV-related disease, with the greatest cancer prevention when given in early adolescence before sexual exposure. Two doses suffice if started before age 15, three doses are indicated for older initiators or immunocompromised persons, males should be vaccinated routinely, adults 27–45 may be considered case-by-case with limited benefit, and safety is excellent across millions of doses. These conclusions are supported by high-quality systematic reviews, population studies, and convergent guidelines [^45839215] [^63e69aab] [^17949483] [^b3a076c1].

The HPV vaccine is **highly effective** at preventing HPV infections and related cancers, with > 99% efficacy against cervical precancers when given before exposure [^c8b1e324] [^4eb73827]. It is **safe**, with no serious safety signals in large trials and post-licensure surveillance [^58c29034] [^26c3f334]. Routine vaccination at **ages 11–12** (can start at 9) with a 2-dose schedule is recommended; catch-up through age 26 is advised, and adults 27–45 may consider vaccination via shared decision-making [^17949483] [^b3a076c1]. The 9-valent vaccine covers 90% of HPV-related cancers, and population impact includes marked declines in HPV infections, genital warts, and cervical precancers [^f572aa2d] [^6b973093] [^45839215].

## Vaccine types and composition

Three HPV vaccines are available: **bivalent (2vHPV)** targets HPV 16 and 18; **quadrivalent (4vHPV)** targets HPV 6, 11, 16, and 18; and **nonavalent (9vHPV)** targets HPV 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58. The 9-valent vaccine is the only HPV vaccine currently distributed in the U.S. and prevents about 90% of HPV-related cancers [^f572aa2d].

---

## Mechanism of action

HPV vaccines are **prophylactic** and composed of virus-like particles (VLPs) assembled from the L1 major capsid protein; they are noninfectious and induce strong neutralizing antibody responses that prevent infection with vaccine-covered HPV types [^6499a257].

---

## Clinical efficacy

- **Cervical cancer**: > 99% efficacy against cervical precancers caused by HPV 16/18 when given before exposure; population studies show substantial reductions in cervical cancer incidence [^c8b1e324] [^45839215].
- **Other cancers**: Reduces incidence of vaginal, vulvar, anal, penile, and oropharyngeal cancers linked to vaccine-covered types [^d5e144da].
- **Genital warts**: Quadrivalent and nonavalent vaccines prevent ~90% of genital warts caused by HPV 6/11 [^72c395f2].

---

## Safety profile

- **Common adverse effects**: Injection-site pain, redness, and swelling; mild systemic symptoms (fever, headache) are common but transient [^10c424c1].
- **Serious adverse events**: No increased risk of serious adverse events, autoimmune diseases, or infertility in large trials and post-licensure surveillance [^58c29034] [^26c3f334].
- **Pregnancy**: Not recommended during pregnancy; no evidence of adverse pregnancy outcomes if inadvertently administered [^16aff043].

## Recommended vaccination schedule

| **Age group** | **Recommended schedule** |
|-|-|
| 9–14 years | 2 doses at 0 and 6–12 months; if the interval is < 5 months, a third dose is needed [^68e71260] |
| 15–26 years | 3 doses at 0, 1–2, and 6 months [^16aff043] |
| ≥ 27 years | Shared clinical decision-making for some adults 27–45 years; not routinely recommended [^dbc9f0d9] |

---

## Impact of HPV vaccination programs

Population-level benefits include **declines in HPV infections** — with vaccine-type HPV prevalence down 88% among females aged 14–19 and 81% among those aged 20–24 since vaccine introduction — as well as reductions in genital warts and cervical precancers, with substantial decreases in anogenital warts and CIN2+ observed in vaccinated populations [^6b973093] [^45839215].

---

## Barriers to vaccination and strategies to improve uptake

Barriers include vaccine hesitancy, misinformation, and logistical challenges. Strategies to improve uptake include **provider recommendation** — the strongest predictor of vaccination — school-based programs, and public education campaigns [^44d5f11e] [^4eb73827].

---

## Global perspectives and disparities

High-income countries have achieved greater coverage and earlier impact, whereas **low- and middle-income countries** face supply constraints, cost, and infrastructure barriers. WHO initiatives support equitable access, including single-dose strategies and Gavi support [^0feb41c2] [^4eb73827].

---

## Future directions

Research is evaluating **single-dose regimens**, extended age ranges, and novel vaccine formulations, while ongoing surveillance monitors long-term effectiveness and safety [^186c9610] [^3897419d].

---

The HPV vaccine is **highly effective and safe**, with broad cancer prevention benefits and a strong public health impact; early adolescent vaccination is the cornerstone of prevention, and catch-up through age 26 is recommended.

Background

Uptake of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine remains low in many countries, although the bivalent and quadrivalent HPV vaccines given as a three-dose schedule are effective in the prevention of precancerous lesions of the cervix in women. Simpler immunisation schedules, such as those with fewer doses, might reduce barriers to vaccination, as may programmes that include males.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy, immunogenicity, and harms of different dose schedules and different types of HPV vaccines in females and males.

Search Methods

We conducted electronic searches on 27 September 2018 in Ovid MEDLINE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (in the Cochrane Library), and Ovid Embase. We also searched the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov (both 27 September 2018), vaccine manufacturer websites, and checked reference lists from an index of HPV studies and other relevant systematic reviews.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with no language restriction. We considered studies if they enrolled HIV-negative males or females aged 9 to 26 years, or HIV-positive males or females of any age.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used methods recommended by Cochrane. We use the term 'control' to refer to comparator products containing an adjuvant or active vaccine and 'placebo' to refer to products that contain no adjuvant or active vaccine. Most primary outcomes in this review were clinical outcomes. However, for comparisons comparing dose schedules, the included RCTs were designed to measure antibody responses (i.e. immunogenicity) as the primary outcome, rather than clinical outcomes, since it is unethical to collect cervical samples from girls under 16 years of age. We analysed immunogenicity outcomes (i.e.g.eometric mean titres) with ratios of means, clinical outcomes (e.g. cancer and intraepithelial neoplasia) with risk ratios or rate ratios and, for serious adverse events and deaths, we calculated odds ratios. We rated the certainty of evidence with GRADE.

Main Results

We included 20 RCTs with 31,940 participants. The length of follow-up in the included studies ranged from seven months to five years. Two doses versus three doses of HPV vaccine in 9- to 15-year-old females Antibody responses after two-dose and three-dose HPV vaccine schedules were similar after up to five years of follow-up (4 RCTs, moderate- to high-certainty evidence). No RCTs collected clinical outcome data. Evidence about serious adverse events in studies comparing dose schedules was of very low-certainty owing to imprecision and indirectness (three doses 35/1159; two doses 36/1158; 4 RCTs). One death was reported in the three-dose group (1/898) and none in the two-dose group (0/899) (low-certainty evidence). Interval between doses of HPV vaccine in 9- to 14-year-old females and males Antibody responses were stronger with a longer interval (6 or 12 months) between the first two doses of HPV vaccine than a shorter interval (2 or 6 months) at up to three years of follow-up (4 RCTs, moderate- to high-certainty evidence). No RCTs collected data about clinical outcomes. Evidence about serious adverse events in studies comparing intervals was of very low-certainty, owing to imprecision and indirectness. No deaths were reported in any of the studies (0/1898, 3 RCTs, low-certainty evidence). HPV vaccination of 10- to 26-year-old males In one RCT there was moderate-certainty evidence that quadrivalent HPV vaccine, compared with control, reduced the incidence of external genital lesions (control 36 per 3081 person-years; quadrivalent 6 per 3173 person-years; rate ratio 0.16, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.38; 6254 person-years) and anogenital warts (control 28 per 2814 person-years; quadrivalent 3 per 2831 person-years; rate ratio 0.11, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.38; 5645 person-years). The quadrivalent vaccine resulted in more injection-site adverse events, such as pain or redness, than control (537 versus 601 per 1000; risk ratio (RR) 1.12, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.18, 3895 participants, high-certainty evidence). There was very low-certainty evidence from two RCTs about serious adverse events with quadrivalent vaccine (control 12/2588; quadrivalent 8/2574), and about deaths (control 11/2591; quadrivalent 3/2582), owing to imprecision and indirectness. Nonavalent versus quadrivalent vaccine in 9- to 26-year-old females and males Three RCTs were included; one in females aged 9- to 15-years (n = 600), one in females aged 16- to 26-years (n = 14,215), and one in males aged 16- to 26-years (n = 500). The RCT in 16- to 26-year-old females reported clinical outcomes. There was little to no difference in the incidence of the combined outcome of high-grade cervical epithelial neoplasia, adenocarcinoma in situ, or cervical cancer between the HPV vaccines (quadrivalent 325/6882, nonavalent 326/6871; OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.16; 13,753 participants; high-certainty evidence). The other two RCTs did not collect data about clinical outcomes. There were slightly more local adverse events with the nonavalent vaccine (905 per 1000) than the quadrivalent vaccine (846 per 1000) (RR 1.07, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.08; 3 RCTs, 15,863 participants; high-certainty evidence). Comparative evidence about serious adverse events in the three RCTs (nonavalent 243/8234, quadrivalent 192/7629; OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.14 to 2.61) was of low certainty, owing to imprecision and indirectness. HPV vaccination for people living with HIV Seven RCTs reported on HPV vaccines in people with HIV, with two small trials that collected data about clinical outcomes. Antibody responses were higher following vaccination with either bivalent or quadrivalent HPV vaccine than with control, and these responses could be demonstrated to have been maintained for up to 24 months in children living with HIV (low-certainty evidence). The evidence about clinical outcomes and harms for HPV vaccines in people with HIV is very uncertain (low- to very low-certainty evidence), owing to imprecision and indirectness.

Authors' Conclusions

The immunogenicity of two-dose and three-dose HPV vaccine schedules, measured using antibody responses in young females, is comparable. The quadrivalent vaccine probably reduces external genital lesions and anogenital warts in males compared with control. The nonavalent and quadrivalent vaccines offer similar protection against a combined outcome of cervical, vaginal, and vulval precancer lesions or cancer. In people living with HIV, both the bivalent and quadrivalent HPV vaccines result in high antibody responses. For all comparisons of alternative HPV vaccine schedules, the certainty of the body of evidence about serious adverse events reported during the study periods was low or very low, either because the number of events was low, or the evidence was indirect, or both. Post-marketing surveillance is needed to continue monitoring harms that might be associated with HPV vaccines in the population, and this evidence will be incorporated in future updates of this review. Long-term observational studies are needed to determine the effectiveness of reduced-dose schedules against HPV-related cancer endpoints, and whether adopting these schedules improves vaccine coverage rates.

### HPV vaccines: their pathology-based discovery, benefits, and adverse effects [^123e9de0]. Annals of Diagnostic Pathology (2015). Low credibility.

The discovery of the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine illustrates the power of in situ-based pathologic analysis in better understanding and curing diseases. The 2 available HPV vaccines have markedly reduced the incidence of cervical intraepithelial neoplasias, genital warts, and cervical cancer throughout the world. Concerns about HPV vaccine safety have led some physicians, health care officials, and parents to refuse providing the recommended vaccination to the target population. The aims of the study were to discuss the discovery of HPV vaccine and review scientific data related to measurable outcomes from the use of HPV vaccines. The strong type-specific immunity against HPV in humans has been known for more than 25 years. Multiple studies confirm the positive risk benefit of HPV vaccination with minimal documented adverse effects. The most common adverse effect, injection site pain, occurred in about 10% of girls and was less than the rate reported for other vaccines. Use of HPV vaccine should be expanded into more diverse populations, mainly in low-resource settings.

### Human papillomavirus vaccination: current indications and future directions [^baf01e71]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) is one of the most common sexually transmitted infections affecting both men and women worldwide. The development of the prophylactic HPV vaccines is a significant pharmaceutical innovation with potential to reduce HPV-related morbidity. However, barriers to the universal use and acceptability of the HPV vaccines continue to exist in both economically privileged and disadvantaged countries. It may be decades before the impact of preventive vaccines on HPV-related diseases caused by the considerable burden of HPV infections will be seen. Collaborative efforts must continue to promote vaccine implementation.

### Use of 9-valent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine: updated HPV vaccination recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices [^7055adfc]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2015). Low credibility.

What is currently recommended?

The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends routine HPV vaccination at age 11 or 12 years. The vaccination series can be started beginning at age 9 years. Vaccination is also recommended for females aged 13 through 26 years and for males aged 13 through 21 years who have not been vaccinated previously or who have not completed the 3-dose series. Males aged 22 through 26 years may be vaccinated. ACIP recommends vaccination of men who have sex with men and immunocompromised persons through age 26 years if not vaccinated previously.

Why are the recommendations being updated now?

9-valent HPV vaccine (9vHPV) was approved by the Food and Drug Administration on December 10, 2014. This vaccine targets HPV types 6, 11, 16, and 18, the types targeted by the quadrivalent HPV vaccine (4vHPV), as well as five additional types, HPV types 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58. ACIP reviewed results of a randomized trial among approximately 14,000 females aged 16 through 26 years that showed noninferior immunogenicity for the types shared by 4vHPV and 9vHPV and high efficacy for the five additional types. Other trials in the 9vHPV clinical development program included studies that compared antibody responses across age groups and females and males and concomitant vaccination studies. The evidence supporting 9vHPV vaccination was evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework and determined to be type 2 (moderate level of evidence) among females and 3 (low level of evidence) among males; the recommendation was designated as a Category A recommendation (recommendation for all persons in an age- or risk-factor–based group).

What are the new recommendations?

9vHPV, 4vHPV or 2vHPV can be used for routine vaccination of females aged 11 or 12 years and females through age 26 years who have not been vaccinated previously or who have not completed the 3-dose series. 9vHPV or 4vHPV can be used for routine vaccination of males aged 11 or 12 years and males through age 21 years who have not been vaccinated previously or who have not completed the 3-dose series. ACIP recommends either 9vHPV or 4vHPV vaccination for men who have sex with men and immunocompromised persons (including those with HIV infection) through age 26 years if not vaccinated previously.

Main results

We included 20 RCTs with 31,940 participants. The length of follow‐up in the included studies ranged from seven months to five years.

Two doses versus three doses of HPV vaccine in 9‐ to 15‐year‐old females

Antibody responses after two‐dose and three‐dose HPV vaccine schedules were similar after up to five years of follow‐up (4 RCTs, moderate‐ to high‐certainty evidence). No RCTs collected clinical outcome data. Evidence about serious adverse events in studies comparing dose schedules was of very low‐certainty owing to imprecision and indirectness (three doses 35/1159; two doses 36/1158; 4 RCTs). One death was reported in the three‐dose group (1/898) and none in the two‐dose group (0/899) (low‐certainty evidence).

Interval between doses of HPV vaccine in 9‐ to 14‐year‐old females and males

Antibody responses were stronger with a longer interval (6 or 12 months) between the first two doses of HPV vaccine than a shorter interval (2 or 6 months) at up to three years of follow‐up (4 RCTs, moderate‐ to high‐certainty evidence). No RCTs collected data about clinical outcomes. Evidence about serious adverse events in studies comparing intervals was of very low‐certainty, owing to imprecision and indirectness. No deaths were reported in any of the studies (0/1898, 3 RCTs, low‐certainty evidence).

HPV vaccination of 10‐ to 26‐year‐old males

In one RCT there was moderate‐certainty evidence that quadrivalent HPV vaccine, compared with control, reduced the incidence of external genital lesions (control 36 per 3081 person‐years; quadrivalent 6 per 3173 person‐years; rate ratio 0.16, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.38; 6254 person‐years) and anogenital warts (control 28 per 2814 person‐years; quadrivalent 3 per 2831 person‐years; rate ratio 0.11, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.38; 5645 person‐years). The quadrivalent vaccine resulted in more injection‐site adverse events, such as pain or redness, than control (537 versus 601 per 1000; risk ratio (RR) 1.12, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.18, 3895 participants, high‐certainty evidence). There was very low‐certainty evidence from two RCTs about serious adverse events with quadrivalent vaccine (control 12/2588; quadrivalent 8/2574), and about deaths (control 11/2591; quadrivalent 3/2582), owing to imprecision and indirectness.

Nonavalent versus quadrivalent vaccine in 9‐ to 26‐year‐old females and males

Three RCTs were included; one in females aged 9‐ to 15‐years (n = 600), one in females aged 16‐ to 26‐years (n = 14,215), and one in males aged 16‐ to 26‐years (n = 500). The RCT in 16‐ to 26‐year‐old females reported clinical outcomes. There was little to no difference in the incidence of the combined outcome of high‐grade cervical epithelial neoplasia, adenocarcinoma in situ, or cervical cancer between the HPV vaccines (quadrivalent 325/6882, nonavalent 326/6871; OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.16; 13,753 participants; high‐certainty evidence). The other two RCTs did not collect data about clinical outcomes. There were slightly more local adverse events with the nonavalent vaccine (905 per 1000) than the quadrivalent vaccine (846 per 1000) (RR 1.07, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.08; 3 RCTs, 15,863 participants; high‐certainty evidence). Comparative evidence about serious adverse events in the three RCTs (nonavalent 243/8234, quadrivalent 192/7629; OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.14 to 2.61) was of low certainty, owing to imprecision and indirectness.

HPV vaccination for people living with HIV

Seven RCTs reported on HPV vaccines in people with HIV, with two small trials that collected data about clinical outcomes. Antibody responses were higher following vaccination with either bivalent or quadrivalent HPV vaccine than with control, and these responses could be demonstrated to have been maintained for up to 24 months in children living with HIV (low‐certainty evidence). The evidence about clinical outcomes and harms for HPV vaccines in people with HIV is very uncertain (low‐ to very low‐certainty evidence), owing to imprecision and indirectness.

Authors' conclusions

The immunogenicity of two‐dose and three‐dose HPV vaccine schedules, measured using antibody responses in young females, is comparable. The quadrivalent vaccine probably reduces external genital lesions and anogenital warts in males compared with control. The nonavalent and quadrivalent vaccines offer similar protection against a combined outcome of cervical, vaginal, and vulval precancer lesions or cancer. In people living with HIV, both the bivalent and quadrivalent HPV vaccines result in high antibody responses. For all comparisons of alternative HPV vaccine schedules, the certainty of the body of evidence about serious adverse events reported during the study periods was low or very low, either because the number of events was low, or the evidence was indirect, or both. Post‐marketing surveillance is needed to continue monitoring harms that might be associated with HPV vaccines in the population, and this evidence will be incorporated in future updates of this review. Long‐term observational studies are needed to determine the effectiveness of reduced‐dose schedules against HPV‐related cancer endpoints, and whether adopting these schedules improves vaccine coverage rates.

### Effects of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination programmes on community rates of HPV-related disease and harms from vaccination [^45839215]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination has the potential to enhance prevention of cervical cancer, especially in countries where screening programmes are currently unaffordable or impractical. Rare adverse events and longer‐term benefits of HPV vaccination, such as effects on cancer rates, are difficult to examine in randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and require large data from population‐level studies to inform decision‐making.

Objectives

We aimed to assess population‐level effects of HPV vaccination programmes on HPV‐related disease and harms from vaccination.

Search methods

We conducted electronic searches on 11 September 2024 in CENTRAL (Cochrane Library), Ovid MEDLINE and Ovid Embase. We also searched vaccine manufacturer websites and checked reference lists from an index of HPV studies and other relevant systematic reviews.

Selection criteria

We included studies that assessed the impact of HPV vaccination on the general population. This included population‐level studies comparing outcomes before and after the introduction of HPV vaccine. We also included individual‐level, non‐randomised comparative studies, such as cohort studies, case‐control studies, cross‐sectional studies and self‐controlled case series.

Data collection and analysis

We used methods recommended by Cochrane. Two review authors carried out data extraction independently using pretested data extraction forms. We assessed the risk of bias of all included effect estimates using different tools according to study design. We carried out quantitative and qualitative data synthesis separately by outcome and study design. We performed meta‐analysis on studies that reported effect estimates adjusted for confounding, with a focus on those receiving HPV vaccination at or before the age of 16 years (the target age group for vaccination). We rated the certainty of the evidence with GRADE.

Main results

We included 225 studies from 347 records in this review, evaluating over 132 million people. We included 86 cohort studies, four case‐control studies, 46 cross‐sectional studies, 69 pre‐post vaccine introduction studies, five RCT extensions and two self‐controlled case series. Thirteen additional studies reported on more than one type of analysis. Of the included studies, 177 reported only on females, 11 only males and 37 a combination of males and females. Risk of bias ranged from overall moderate risk to critical risk.

Clinical outcomes

There was moderate‐certainty evidence from 20 studies that HPV vaccination reduces the incidence of cervical cancer. Five cohort studies including 4,390,243 females reported adjusted estimates showing a reduced risk of cervical cancer following HPV vaccination in the long term (risk ratio (RR) 0.37, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.25 to 0.56; I² = 88%). There was a significant interaction with age at vaccination, with a greater risk reduction in younger people. For those vaccinated at or before 16 years of age, covering 4.54 million person‐years, there was an 80% reduced risk of cervical cancer (RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.44; I² = 69%). One cohort study, one case‐control study, one cross‐sectional study and three RCT extension studies all reported no cases of cervical cancer in the HPV vaccine groups. Eight pre‐post vaccine introduction studies each reported a reduction in cervical cancer incidence following HPV vaccine introduction but did not provide data in a form that allowed for meta‐analysis.

There was moderate‐certainty evidence from 23 studies that HPV vaccination reduces the incidence of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 or higher (CIN3+), including 12 cohort studies. For 1.5 million females vaccinated at or before the age of 16 years in two cohort studies, there was a reduction of CIN3+ incidence of 74% in the long term (RR 0.26, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.56; I² = 80%). Three case‐control studies, one RCT extension study and three cross‐sectional studies also reported a decreased risk of CIN3+ in vaccinated participants. One cross‐sectional study reported no difference in the risk of CIN3+. Three pre‐post vaccine introduction studies reported a decrease in CIN3+ incidence following HPV vaccine introduction.

There was moderate‐certainty evidence from 37 studies that HPV vaccination reduces the incidence of CIN2+. In cohort studies with females vaccinated at or before the age of 16 years, a reduction in risk was seen in the medium term (RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.65; 2 cohort studies, 233,468 females; I² = 0%) and long term (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.45; 5 cohort studies, 6,455,176 females; I² = 64%).

There was moderate‐certainty evidence from 47 studies that HPV vaccination reduces the incidence of anogenital warts. From the cohort studies with adjusted estimates, the pooled impact of HPV vaccination on rates of anogenital warts indicated a reduction of 47% in the medium term (RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.77; 4 studies, 6,430,295 females and 313 males; I² = 98%) and 53% in the long term (RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.61; 13 studies, 4.5 million person‐years plus 5,802,969 females and males; I² = 99%). Twenty‐three pre‐post vaccine introduction studies reported a decrease in anogenital warts incidence following the introduction of HPV vaccine. Six studies reported no difference in anogenital warts incidence.

There was only very low‐certainty evidence on the effect of HPV vaccination on the incidence of adenocarcinoma in situ (three studies) and vulval cancer (five studies). No studies were identified that reported on community rates of serious adverse events following HPV vaccination.

Specific adverse events

Across a range of study designs, HPV vaccination was not associated with an increased risk of postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis, paralysis, complex regional pain syndrome, premature ovarian failure, infertility or sexual activity (all moderate‐certainty evidence). There was evidence that suggests HPV vaccination was not associated with an increased risk of Guillain‐Barré syndrome (low‐certainty evidence).

Authors' conclusions

There are now long‐term outcome data from different countries and from different study designs that consistently report a reduction in the development of high‐grade CIN and cervical cancer in females vaccinated against HPV in early adolescence. Data show that there is greater benefit to vaccinating younger adolescents prior to becoming sexually active. There is evidence that HPV vaccination does not increase the risk of the most common adverse events reported on social media.

### Human papillomavirus vaccination 2020 guideline update: American cancer society guideline adaptation [^b3a076c1]. CA (2020). High credibility.

American Cancer Society human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination recommendations — The ACS recommends routine HPV vaccination between ages 9 and 12 years to achieve higher on-time vaccination rates. Health care providers are encouraged to start offering the HPV vaccine series at age 9 or 10 years. Catch-up HPV vaccination is recommended for all persons through age 26 years who are not adequately vaccinated, and providers should inform individuals aged 22 to 26 years who have not been previously vaccinated or who have not completed the series that vaccination at older ages is less effective in lowering cancer risk. Catch-up HPV vaccination is not recommended for adults aged older than 26 years. The ACS does not endorse the 2019 Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommendation for shared clinical decision making for some adults aged 27 through 45 years who are not adequately vaccinated because of the low effectiveness and low cancer prevention potential of vaccination in this age group, the burden of decision making on patients and clinicians, and the lack of sufficient guidance on the selection of individuals who might benefit.

### Human papillomavirus vaccination for adults: updated recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices [^dbc9f0d9]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2019). Medium credibility.

Vaccination against human papillomavirus (HPV) is recommended to prevent new HPV infections and HPV-associated diseases, including some cancers. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP)* routinely recommends HPV vaccination at age 11 or 12 years; vaccination can be given starting at age 9 years. Catch-up vaccination has been recommended since 2006 for females through age 26 years, and since 2011 for males through age 21 years and certain special populations through age 26 years. This report updates ACIP catch-up HPV vaccination recommendations and guidance published in 2014, 2015, and 2016 (1–3). Routine recommendations for vaccination of adolescents have not changed. In June 2019, ACIP recommended catch-up HPV vaccination for all persons through age 26 years. ACIP did not recommend catch-up vaccination for all adults aged 27 through 45 years, but recognized that some persons who are not adequately vaccinated might be at risk for new HPV infection and might benefit from vaccination in this age range; therefore, ACIP recommended shared clinical decision-making regarding potential HPV vaccination for these persons.

### Age considerations when vaccinating against HPV [^9172cf5f]. Gynecologic Oncology (2008). Low credibility.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines have been shown to be both highly effective and safe, and there is now considerable enthusiasm among healthcare providers to use the vaccines to reduce the burden of HPV-associated disease in women. When considering who should be vaccinated, it is important that providers understand the complex relationships between age and HPV infections. HPV infections and cervical cancer have a widespread impact on society. Cervical cancer is the cause of a significant amount of morbidity and mortality throughout the world, making it crucial to implement prophylactic HPV vaccines to prevent cervical cancer. Nationally, the target group for vaccination is pre-adolescent females who have not been sexually active or who have recently become sexually active. In the United States, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommends HPV vaccination for females aged 11 to 12 years. "Catch-up" vaccination of females aged 13 to 26 years who have not been previously vaccinated or who have missed a vaccination is also recommended, as females within this age group have the highest prevalence of HPV infection. Vaccination can still benefit females over the age of 26 years who have not been previously exposed to HPV 6, 11, 16, or 18 and those who may have new sexual partners in the future. This review discusses the various considerations that should be addressed when making recommendations of who should be vaccinated against HPV.

### Use of a 2-dose schedule for human papillomavirus vaccination-updated recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices [^68e71260]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2016). Low credibility.

Vaccination against human papillomavirus (HPV) is recommended to prevent HPV infections and HPV-associated diseases, including cancers. Routine vaccination at age 11 or 12 years has been recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) since 2006 for females and since 2011 for males (1,2). This report provides recommendations and guidance regarding use of HPV vaccines and updates ACIP HPV vaccination recommendations previously published in 2014 and 2015 (1,2). This report includes new recommendations for use of a 2-dose schedule for girls and boys who initiate the vaccination series at ages 9 through 14 years. Three doses remain recommended for persons who initiate the vaccination series at ages 15 through 26 years and for immunocompromised persons.

### Human papillomavirus vaccination: recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices (ACIP) [^f4cb7a8a]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2014). Low credibility.

This report summarizes the epidemiology of human papillomavirus (HPV) and associated diseases, describes the licensed HPV vaccines, provides updated data from clinical trials and postlicensure safety studies, and compiles recommendations from CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) for use of HPV vaccines. Persistent infection with oncogenic HPV types can cause cervical cancer in women as well as other anogenital and oropharyngeal cancers in women and men. HPV also causes genital warts. Two HPV vaccines are licensed in the United States. Both are composed of type-specific HPV L1 protein, the major capsid protein of HPV. Expression of the L1 protein using recombinant DNA technology produces noninfectious virus-like particles (VLPs). Quadrivalent HPV vaccine (HPV4) contains four HPV type-specific VLPs prepared from the L1 proteins of HPV 6, 11, 16, and 18. Bivalent HPV vaccine (HPV2) contains two HPV type-specific VLPs prepared from the L1 proteins of HPV 16 and 18. Both vaccines are administered in a 3-dose series. ACIP recommends routine vaccination with HPV4 or HPV2 for females aged 11 or 12 years and with HPV4 for males aged 11 or 12 years. Vaccination also is recommended for females aged 13 through 26 years and for males aged 13 through 21 years who were not vaccinated previously. Males aged 22 through 26 years may be vaccinated. ACIP recommends vaccination of men who have sex with men and immunocompromised persons (including those with HIV infection) through age 26 years if not previously vaccinated. As a compendium of all current recommendations for use of HPV vaccines, information in this report is intended for use by clinicians, vaccination providers, public health officials, and immunization program personnel as a resource. ACIP recommendations are reviewed periodically and are revised as indicated when new information and data become available.

### Human papillomavirus vaccines [^6499a257]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines are among the most effective vaccines available, the first to prevent infection by a mucosatropic sexually transmitted infectious agent and to do so without specific induction of mucosal immunity. Currently available prophylactic HPV vaccines are based on virus-like particles that self-assemble spontaneously from the L1 major capsid protein. The first HPV vaccine was licensed in 2006. All vaccines target HPV-16 and HPV-18, types which cause the majority of HPV-attributable cancers. As of 2020, HPV vaccines had been introduced into national immunization programs in more than 100 countries. Vaccination polices have evolved; most programs target vaccination of young adolescent girls, with an increasing number also including boys. The efficacy and safety found in prelicensure trials have been confirmed by data from national immunization programs. The dramatic impact and effectiveness observed has stimulated interest in ambitious disease reduction goals.

### Human papillomavirus vaccine trials and tribulations: clinical perspectives [^98af9396]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) affects hundreds of millions of people worldwide and is associated with both benign and malignant neoplasms in men and women. It is a double-stranded DNA virus with an icosahedral capsid. Forty HPV types are known to infect mucosal keratinocytes. If not cured by the immune system, the infection can lead to genital warts, mucosal dysplasia, or cancer. The most common oncogenic types are 16 and 18. The vaccine to prevent HPV and its associated morbidity and mortality has existed since 2006. Several variations protect against an increasing number of HPV types. The recommended vaccination age is before sexual exposure; administration of the vaccine to children has been controversial. This continuing medical education review evaluates the current HPV vaccines available to clinicians. Part I focuses on the debate over who should be vaccinated, at what age, and in which populations.

### Human papillomavirus vaccination 2020 guideline update: American cancer society guideline adaptation [^eb9c2ccd]. CA (2020). High credibility.

American Cancer Society (ACS) adapted human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination recommendations — age indications and adult decision-making — state that HPV vaccination is routinely recommended at age 11 or 12 y; vaccination can be given starting at age 9 y, with an ACS qualifying statement that routine HPV vaccination between ages 9–12 y is expected to achieve higher on-time vaccination rates, resulting in increased numbers of cancers prevented, and health care providers are encouraged to start offering the HPV vaccine at age 9 or 10 y. Vaccination is recommended for all persons through age 26 y who are not adequately vaccinated, and the ACS qualifying statement specifies that providers should inform individuals aged 22–26 y who have not been previously vaccinated or who have not completed the series that vaccination at older ages is less effective in lowering cancer risk. For adults, catch-up HPV vaccination is not recommended for all aged > 26 y and instead shared clinical decision making is recommended for some adults aged 27–45 y who are not adequately vaccinated; however, the ACS does not endorse the recommendation for shared clinical decision making for adults aged 27–45 y because of the low effectiveness and low cancer prevention potential of vaccination in this age group, the burden of decision making on patients and clinicians, and the lack of sufficient guidance on selection of individuals who might benefit.

### Human papillomavirus vaccination 2020 guideline update: American cancer society guideline adaptation [^0da03180]. CA (2020). High credibility.

Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) 2019 human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination — For children and adults aged 9–26 y, HPV vaccination is routinely recommended at age 11 or 12 y; vaccination can be given starting at age 9 y, and vaccination is recommended for all persons through age 26 y who are not adequately vaccinated. For adults aged > 26 y, catch-up HPV vaccination is not recommended for all adults aged > 26 y; instead, shared clinical decision making regarding HPV vaccination is recommended for some adults aged 27–45 y who are not adequately vaccinated, and HPV vaccines are not licensed for use in adults aged > 45 y. Administration guidance states that dosing schedules, intervals, and definitions of persons considered adequately vaccinated have not changed and that no prevaccination testing (eg, Pap or HPV testing) is recommended to establish the appropriateness of HPV vaccination. Cervical cancer screening guidelines and recommendations should be followed. These recommendations for children and adults aged 9–26 y and for adults aged > 26 y apply to all persons, regardless of behavioral or medical risk factors; for persons who are pregnant, HPV vaccination should be delayed until after pregnancy, however, pregnancy testing is not needed before vaccination, and persons who are breastfeeding or lactating can receive HPV vaccine.

### Human papillomavirus vaccination 2020 guideline update: American cancer society guideline adaptation [^292844bd]. CA (2020). High credibility.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination — adults older than 26 years: ACIP indicates that catch-up HPV vaccination is not recommended for all adults aged > 26 years; instead, shared clinical decision making is recommended for some adults aged 27 through 45 years who are not adequately vaccinated, and HPV vaccines are not licensed for use in adults aged > 45 years. The ACS does not endorse the recommendation for shared clinical decision making for adults aged 27 through 45 years because of the low effectiveness and low cancer prevention potential of vaccination in this age group, the burden on patients and clinicians, and the lack of sufficient guidance on selecting individuals who might benefit. Supporting context notes that HPV vaccination is most effective in early adolescence, with effectiveness decreasing dramatically by age 18 years and minimal benefit noted by age 20 or 21 years, and that compared with vaccination through age 26 years, extending to adults through age 45 years was estimated to prevent only an additional 0.5% cases of cancer, 0.4% cases of cervical precancer, and 0.3% cases of genital warts over the next 100 years.

### Quadrivalent human papillomavirus vaccine: recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices (ACIP) [^d35501b8]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2007). Low credibility.

These recommendations represent the first statement by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) on the use of a quadrivalent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine licensed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on June 8, 2006. This report summarizes the epidemiology of HPV and associated diseases, describes the licensed HPV vaccine, and provides recommendations for its use for vaccination among females aged 9–26 years in the United States. Genital HPV is the most common sexually transmitted infection in the United States; an estimated 6.2 million persons are newly infected every year. Although the majority of infections cause no clinical symptoms and are self-limited, persistent infection with oncogenic types can cause cervical cancer in women. HPV infection also is the cause of genital warts and is associated with other anogenital cancers. Cervical cancer rates have decreased in the United States because of widespread use of Papanicolaou testing, which can detect precancerous lesions of the cervix before they develop into cancer; nevertheless, during 2007, an estimated 11,100 new cases will be diagnosed and approximately 3,700 women will die from cervical cancer. In certain countries where cervical cancer screening is not routine, cervical cancer is a common cancer in women. The licensed HPV vaccine is composed of the HPV L1 protein, the major capsid protein of HPV. Expression of the L1 protein in yeast using recombinant DNA technology produces noninfectious virus-like particles (VLP) that resemble HPV virions. The quadrivalent HPV vaccine is a mixture of four HPV type-specific VLPs prepared from the L1 proteins of HPV 6, 11, 16, and 18 combined with an aluminum adjuvant. Clinical trials indicate that the vaccine has high efficacy in preventing persistent HPV infection, cervical cancer precursor lesions, vaginal and vulvar cancer precursor lesions, and genital warts caused by HPV types 6, 11, 16, or 18 among females who have not already been infected with the respective HPV type. No evidence exists of protection against disease caused by HPV types with which females are infected at the time of vaccination. However, females infected with one or more vaccine HPV types before vaccination would be protected against disease caused by the other vaccine HPV types. The vaccine is administered by intramuscular injection, and the recommended schedule is a 3-dose series with the second and third doses administered 2 and 6 months after the first dose. The recommended age for vaccination of females is 11–12 years. Vaccine can be administered as young as age 9 years. Catch-up vaccination is recommended for females aged 13–26 years who have not been previously vaccinated. Vaccination is not a substitute for routine cervical cancer screening, and vaccinated females should have cervical cancer screening as recommended.

Clinical Question

Who should receive human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination?

Bottom Line

Catch-up vaccination is now recommended for all persons through age 26 years. For persons aged 27 through 45 years, clinicians and patients should now jointly decide whether HPV vaccination is appropriate. Routine HPV vaccination at age 11 or 12 years (or as early as age 9 years) continues to be recommended.

### Human papillomavirus vaccination guideline update: American cancer society guideline endorsement [^10fdc023]. CA (2016). Low credibility.

Answer questions and earn CME/CNE The American Cancer Society (ACS) reviewed and updated its guideline on human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination based on a methodologic and content review of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) HPV vaccination recommendations. A literature review was performed to supplement the evidence considered by the ACIP and to address new vaccine formulations and recommendations as well as new data on population outcomes since publication of the 2007 ACS guideline. The ACS Guideline Development Group determined that the evidence supports ACS endorsement of the ACIP recommendations, with one qualifying statement related to late vaccination. The ACS recommends vaccination of all children at ages 11 and 12 years to protect against HPV infections that lead to several cancers and precancers. Late vaccination for those not vaccinated at the recommended ages should be completed as soon as possible, and individuals should be informed that vaccination may not be effective at older ages.

### Use of 9-valent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine: updated HPV vaccination recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices [^d1fbcb81]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2015). Low credibility.

Methods

From October 2013 to February 2015, the ACIP HPV Vaccine Work Group reviewed clinical trial data assessing the efficacy, immunogenicity, and safety of 9vHPV, modeling data on cost-effectiveness of 9vHPV, and data on burden of type-specific HPV-associated disease in the United States. Summaries of reviewed evidence and Work Group discussions were presented to ACIP before recommendations were proposed. Recommendations were approved by ACIP in February 2015. Evidence supporting 9vHPV use was evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework and determined to be type 2 (moderate level of evidence) among females and 3 (low level of evidence) among males; the recommendation was categorized as a Category A recommendation (for all persons in an age- or risk-factor–based group).

Introduction

Vaccination against human papillomavirus (HPV) is recommended to prevent new HPV infections and HPV-associated diseases, including some cancers. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) * routinely recommends HPV vaccination at age 11 or 12 years; vaccination can be given starting at age 9 years. Catch-up vaccination has been recommended since 2006 for females through age 26 years, and since 2011 for males through age 21 years and certain special populations through age 26 years. This report updates ACIP catch-up HPV vaccination recommendations and guidance published in 2014, 2015, and 2016. Routine recommendations for vaccination of adolescents have not changed. In June 2019, ACIP recommended catch-up HPV vaccination for all persons through age 26 years. ACIP did not recommend catch-up vaccination for all adults aged 27 through 45 years, but recognized that some persons who are not adequately vaccinated might be at risk for new HPV infection and might benefit from vaccination in this age range; therefore, ACIP recommended shared clinical decision-making regarding potential HPV vaccination for these persons.

### Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine safety… [^58c29034]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

CDC is aware of public concern about the safety of HPV vaccine. Since the vaccine's introduction in 2006, vaccine safety monitoring and studies conducted by CDC, FDA, and other organizations have documented a reassuring safety record. Available vaccines & manufacturer package inserts Gardasil 9 and manufacturer insert
- Gardasil 9 was approved by FDA for use in 2014.
- The safety of Gardasil 9 was studied in clinical trials with more than 15, 000 participants before it was licensed and continues to be monitored.
- Gardasil 9 protects against 9 types of cancer-causing HPV types 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58. For HPV vaccine to be most effective, the series should begin prior to exposure to HPV. Keep Reading: Vaccine Information Statement. The 9vHPV vaccine adds 5 additional antigens, providing protection against 9 types of cancer-causing human papillomaviruses.

Studies of 2vHPV have also shown a favorable safety profile. While the vaccines target different HPV types, all three HPV vaccines are similar and made from a single protein of the HPV virus. Who should & should not get the vaccine CDC recommends HPV vaccination for everyone through age 26 years, if not vaccinated already. Teens and young adults who start the series at ages 15 through 26 years still need three doses of HPV vaccine. Three doses are also recommended for people with certain immunocompromising conditions ages 9 through 26 years. Keep Reading: Who should & should not get the vaccine. HPV vaccines and fertility HPV vaccination prevents infection with the HPV types that most commonly cause cervical cancer. In some cases, women develop cervical cancer before starting or finish having children. Treatment for cervical cancer can keep a woman from being able to become pregnant.

Preventing cervical cancer through HPV vaccination reduces this risk. A closer look at the safety data HPV vaccines are safe Findings from many vaccine safety monitoring systems and more than 160 studies have shown that HPV vaccines have a favorable safety profile — the body of scientific evidence overwhelmingly supports their safety. Of the reports to VAERS, 6% were classified as "serious. " Of the other reports to VAERS relating to HPV, about 22% of the reports were not related to health problems, but were reported for reasons such as improper vaccine storage or the vaccine being given to someone for whom it was not recommended. Over 100 million doses of HPV vaccines were distributed in the United States from June 2006 through December 2017. To date, most of CDC's HPV vaccine safety monitoring and research has focused on Gardasil because it has accounted for the majority of HPV vaccine doses distributed in the United States.

These safety efforts continue, now focusing on Gardasil 9.
- **Analysis from VSD**: The Vaccine Safety Datalink conducted near-real time surveillance from October 2015 through October 2017, looking at 11 pre-specified adverse events. During this two-year time period, nearly 840, 000 doses were administered to people aged 9–26 years at six VSD sites. No new safety concerns were identified.

### Use of 9-valent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine: updated HPV vaccination recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices [^17933071]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2015). Medium credibility.

Use of 9-valent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine — The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended 9-valent HPV vaccine (9vHPV) as one of three HPV vaccines that can be used for routine vaccination, and HPV vaccine is recommended for routine vaccination at age 11 or 12 years. ACIP also recommends vaccination for females aged 13 through 26 years and males aged 13 through 21 years not vaccinated previously, and vaccination is also recommended through age 26 years for men who have sex with men and for immunocompromised persons (including those with HIV infection) if not vaccinated previously. 9vHPV was licensed by the Food and Drug Administration on December 10, 2014 for use in females aged 9 through 26 years and males aged 9 through 15 years, and for these recommendations ACIP reviewed additional data on 9vHPV in males aged 16 through 26 years. 9vHPV and 4vHPV are licensed for use in females and males, whereas bivalent HPV vaccine (2vHPV), which contains HPV 16, 18 VLPs, is licensed for use in females.

### Use of 9-valent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine: updated HPV vaccination recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices [^a7ab3d9f]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2015). Low credibility.

During its February 2015 meeting, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended 9-valent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine (9vHPV) (Gardasil 9, Merck and Co, Inc.) as one of three HPV vaccines that can be used for routine vaccination. HPV vaccine is recommended for routine vaccination at age 11 or 12 years. ACIP also recommends vaccination for females aged 13 through 26 years and males aged 13 through 21 years not vaccinated previously. Vaccination is also recommended through age 26 years for men who have sex with men and for immunocompromised persons (including those with HIV infection) if not vaccinated previously. 9vHPV is a noninfectious, virus-like particle (VLP) vaccine. Similar to quadrivalent HPV vaccine (4vHPV), 9vHPV contains HPV 6, 11, 16, and 18 VLPs. In addition, 9vHPV contains HPV 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58 VLPs. 9vHPV was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on December 10, 2014, for use in females aged 9 through 26 years and males aged 9 through 15 years. For these recommendations, ACIP reviewed additional data on 9vHPV in males aged 16 through 26 years. 9vHPV and 4vHPV are licensed for use in females and males. Bivalent HPV vaccine (2vHPV), which contains HPV 16, 18 VLPs, is licensed for use in females. This report summarizes evidence considered by ACIP in recommending 9vHPV as one of three HPV vaccines that can be used for vaccination and provides recommendations for vaccine use.

### Human papillomavirus vaccination: ongoing challenges and future directions [^baff7fd8]. Gynecologic Oncology (2020). Medium credibility.

Studies with prophylactic HPV vaccination have demonstrated impressive efficacy, immunogenicity, and safety results; however, the implementation and uptake in both low and high-income countries continues to be challenging. Since 2006, administration guidelines have undergone multiple updates regarding age, dosing schedule, and gender. Despite these changes, the basic tenet remains the same: prioritize immunization before initiation of sexual activity and subsequent exposure to HPV. The importance of immunizing males and females equally and the role for catch-up vaccination in late adolescent and adulthood has also been supported by subsequent research. Very recently, the FDA approved to expand the range of eligible patients for the nonavalent (9vHPV) vaccine to women and men from age 27 to 45 for the prevention of HPV-related cancers and diseases. Furthermore, members of the ACIP voted to recommend that individuals between ages 27 and 45 who have not yet been vaccinated discuss the option with their physician. This review will highlight the history of the vaccine, barriers to vaccination, current recommendations, and future directions for success.

### Committee opinion no. 588: human papillomavirus vaccination [^cdff8250]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2014). Low credibility.

The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination routinely be targeted to females and males aged 11 years or 12 years as part of the adolescent immunization platform to help reduce the incidence of anogenital cancers and genital warts associated with HPV infection. The quadrivalent HPV vaccine is approved for use in males and females, whereas the bivalent HPV vaccine is approved for use only in females. For those not vaccinated at the target age, catch-up vaccination is recommended up to age 26 years. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists endorses these recommendations. Although obstetrician-gynecologists are not likely to care for many patients in the initial HPV vaccination target group, they have the opportunity to educate mothers about the importance of vaccinating their children at the recommended age and are critical to vaccinating adolescent girls and young women during the catch-up period. Obstetrician-gynecologists should advise patients and parents that HPV vaccines are most effective in preventing genital cancers when administered before the onset of sexual activity. However, sexually active individuals can receive some benefit from the vaccination because exposure to all HPV types prevented by the vaccines is unlikely in persons aged 13 years through 26 years. Although HPV vaccination in pregnancy is not recommended, neither is routine pregnancy testing before vaccination. Lactating women can receive either HPV vaccine. The need for ongoing cervical cytology screening should be emphasized in all women aged 21 years and older, even those who received HPV vaccination before the onset of sexual activity.

### Human papillomavirus vaccine and men: what are the obstacles and challenges? [^3ce142ed]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The present review describes the indications for vaccinating men with the quadrivalent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine, reports on the US rates of male vaccination, and reviews the recent research on acceptability of vaccinating men and research on the cost-effectiveness of adding men to existing female HPV immunization programs.

Recent Findings

Recent evidence shows that the quadrivalent HPV vaccine prevents several HPV-related diseases in men. However, despite the licensure of the vaccine in the USA for men 9 through 26 years of age, rates of male vaccination are very low. Research on acceptability, in general, indicates strong interest in vaccination among men, parents, and healthcare providers, though female vaccination is typically seen as a higher priority. Cost-effectiveness studies indicate that in the context of modest female vaccination rates and with the specification of a broad range of disease outcomes (e.g. genital warts, anogenital cancers, and oropharyngeal cancers), male vaccination can be quite cost-effective.

Summary

Men are at high risk for HPV infection and can benefit from vaccination, but vaccination rates among men remain extremely low. More research needs to be done on the predictors of uptake of HPV vaccine among men and on the development of interventions to increase male vaccination.

### Human papillomavirus vaccination for adults: updated recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices [^cdb630ef]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2019). Medium credibility.

Methods

During April 2018–June 2019, the ACIP HPV Vaccines Work Group held at least monthly conference calls to review and discuss relevant scientific evidence regarding adult HPV vaccination using the Evidence to Recommendations framework. The Work Group evaluated the quality of evidence for efficacy, safety, and effectiveness for HPV vaccination for primary prevention of HPV infection and HPV-related disease using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.

Scientific literature published during January 1, 2006–October 18, 2018, was searched to identify clinical trials of any licensed HPV vaccine in adults aged 27 through 45 years. Detailed search methods and results for the GRADE tables are available at. Benefits were based on per-protocol analyses of vaccine efficacy; immunogenicity data were also considered. Harms were any vaccine-related serious adverse events. Of 1,388 references identified, 100 were selected for detailed review, and 16 publications were included in GRADE tables presented at the October 2018 ACIP meeting; tables were updated in June 2019 to include new results from a 9vHPV trial. At the June 2019 ACIP meeting, two policy issues were considered: 1) harmonization of catch-up vaccination for all persons through age 26 years, and 2) vaccination of adults aged > 26 years. Two Evidence to Recommendations documents were developed and presented along with proposed recommendations; after a public comment period, ACIP members voted unanimously to harmonize catch-up vaccination recommendations across genders for all persons through age 26 years. ACIP members also voted 10–4 in favor of shared clinical decision-making for adults aged 27 through 45 years, recognizing that some persons who are not adequately vaccinated might be at risk for new HPV infection and might benefit from vaccination in this age range.

### Human papillomavirus vaccination for adults: updated recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices [^ca7b9075]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2019). Medium credibility.

Recommendations

Children and adults aged 9 through 26 years. HPV vaccination is routinely recommended at age 11 or 12 years; vaccination can be given starting at age 9 years. Catch-up HPV vaccination is recommended for all persons through age 26 years who are not adequately vaccinated. †

Adults aged > 26 years. Catch-up HPV vaccination is not recommended for all adults aged > 26 years. Instead, shared clinical decision-making regarding HPV vaccination is recommended for some adults aged 27 through 45 years who are not adequately vaccinated. (Box). HPV vaccines are not licensed for use in adults aged > 45 years.

BOX
Considerations for shared clinical decision-making regarding human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination of adults aged 27 through 45 years

Ideally, HPV vaccination should be given in early adolescence because vaccination is most effective before exposure to HPV through sexual activity. For adults aged 27 through 45 years who are not adequately vaccinated, * clinicians can consider discussing HPV vaccination with persons who are most likely to benefit. HPV vaccination does not need to be discussed with most adults aged > 26 years.

HPV is a very common sexually transmitted infection. Most HPV infections are transient and asymptomatic and cause no clinical problems.
Although new HPV infections are most commonly acquired in adolescence and young adulthood, some adults are at risk for acquiring new HPV infections. At any age, having a new sex partner is a risk factor for acquiring a new HPV infection.
Persons who are in a long-term, mutually monogamous sexual partnership are not likely to acquire a new HPV infection.
Most sexually active adults have been exposed to some HPV types, although not necessarily all of the HPV types targeted by vaccination.
No clinical antibody test can determine whether a person is already immune or still susceptible to any given HPV type.
HPV vaccine efficacy is high among persons who have not been exposed to vaccine-type HPV before vaccination.
Vaccine effectiveness might be low among persons with risk factors for HPV infection or disease (e.g. adults with multiple lifetime sex partners and likely previous infection with vaccine-type HPV), as well as among persons with certain immunocompromising conditions.
HPV vaccines are prophylactic (i.e. they prevent new HPV infections). They do not prevent progression of HPV infection to disease, decrease time to clearance of HPV infection, or treat HPV-related disease.

### Use of 9-valent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine: updated HPV vaccination recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices [^3cd9639d]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2015). Low credibility.

During its February 2015 meeting, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended 9-valent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine (9vHPV) (Gardasil 9, Merck and Co. Inc.) as one of three HPV vaccines that can be used for routine vaccination (Table 1). HPV vaccine is recommended for routine vaccination at age 11 or 12 years. ACIP also recommends vaccination for females aged 13 through 26 years and males aged 13 through 21 years not vaccinated previously. Vaccination is also recommended through age 26 years for men who have sex with men and for immunocompromised persons (including those with HIV infection) if not vaccinated previously. 9vHPV is a noninfectious, virus-like particle (VLP) vaccine. Similar to quadrivalent HPV vaccine (4vHPV), 9vHPV contains HPV 6, 11, 16, and 18 VLPs. In addition, 9vHPV contains HPV 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58 VLPs. 9vHPV was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on December 10, 2014, for use in females aged 9 through 26 years and males aged 9 through 15 years. For these recommendations, ACIP reviewed additional data on 9vHPV in males aged 16 through 26 years. 9vHPV and 4vHPV are licensed for use in females and males. Bivalent HPV vaccine (2vHPV), which contains HPV 16, 18 VLPs, is licensed for use in females. This report summarizes evidence considered by ACIP in recommending 9vHPV as one of three HPV vaccines that can be used for vaccination and provides recommendations for vaccine use.

### Use of 9-valent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine: updated HPV vaccination recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices [^b2c3bf31]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2015). Low credibility.

Recommendations for Use of HPV Vaccines

ACIP recommends that routine HPV vaccination be initiated at age 11 or 12 years. The vaccination series can be started beginning at age 9 years. Vaccination is also recommended for females aged 13 through 26 years and for males aged 13 through 21 years who have not been vaccinated previously or who have not completed the 3-dose series. Males aged 22 through 26 years may be vaccinated. † Vaccination of females is recommended with 2vHPV, 4vHPV (as long as this formulation is available), or 9vHPV. Vaccination of males is recommended with 4vHPV (as long as this formulation is available) or 9vHPV.

2vHPV, 4vHPV, and 9vHPV all protect against HPV 16 and 18, types that cause about 66% of cervical cancers and the majority of other HPV-attributable cancers in the United States. 9vHPV targets five additional cancer causing types, which account for about 15% of cervical cancers. 4vHPV and 9vHPV also protect against HPV 6 and 11, types that cause anogenital warts.

Methods

Criteria for considering studies for this review

Types of studies

We included RCTs with no language restrictions. We included unpublished studies, studies in press, and abstracts without a full‐text publication, if they met the inclusion criteria.

Types of participants

Females or males aged 9 to 26 years, including MSM. For the comparisons among people living with HIV, we included all age groups.

Types of interventions

Prophylactic administration of licensed bivalent (Cervarix, GlaxoSmithKline), quadrivalent (Gardasil, Merck), or nonavalent (Gardasil 9, Merck) HPV vaccines. We excluded studies if they assessed monovalent or plasmid vaccines, or assessed non‐prophylactic uses of bivalent, quadrivalent or nonavalent vaccines. In addition, we considered for inclusion any trials reporting on the efficacy, immunogenicity, or adverse events in vaccines currently in phase 2 or 3 development. Studies comparing bivalent versus quadrivalent vaccines were excluded, as these will be included in an update of a separate Cochrane Review (Arbyn 2018).

For males and people living with HIV, we included comparisons of HPV vaccines to placebo containing no adjuvant or only the adjuvant of the HPV vaccine, or another HPV vaccine.

In this review, we use the term 'control' to refer to comparator products that contain another vaccine or only vaccine adjuvants, regardless of the terminology used in individual study reports. We use the term 'placebo' only to refer to comparator products containing no adjuvant or active vaccine. In Characteristics of included studies we have reported full details of the type of comparison group compound.

The focus of the review was on different dose schedules and comparisons between different types of HPV vaccine. Where possible we stratified data by participant characteristics of age, gender, and HIV status. Specifically, we aimed to investigate the efficacy, immunogenicity, and harms of:

fewer than three doses of HPV vaccine in females and males;
different intervals between doses in a two‐dose schedule in females and males;
HPV vaccination compared to control for males (a Cochrane Review for females has been published (Arbyn 2018));
nonavalent HPV vaccine compared to the other HPV vaccines in females and males;
HPV vaccination in people living with HIV.

### Ten years of human papillomavirus vaccination in the United States [^04909f33]. Academic Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Since human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine was first introduced for females in the United States in 2006, vaccination policy has evolved as additional HPV vaccines were licensed and new data became available. The United States adopted a gender neutral routine HPV immunization policy in 2011, the first country to do so. Vaccination coverage is increasing, although it remains lower than for other vaccines recommended for adolescents. There are various reasons for low coverage, and efforts are ongoing to increase vaccine uptake. The safety profile of HPV vaccine has been well established from 10 years of postlicensure monitoring. Despite low coverage, the early effects of the HPV vaccination program have exceeded expectations.

### Committee opinion no. 467: human papillomavirus vaccination [^740eaf70]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2010). Low credibility.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved both a bivalent and quadrivalent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices has recommended that HPV vaccination routinely be given to girls when they are 11 years or 12 years old. The vaccine can be given to individuals as young as 9 years; catch-up vaccination is recommended in females aged 13 years through 26 years. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists endorses these recommendations. Although obstetrician-gynecologists are not likely to care for many girls in the initial vaccination target group, they are critical to the catch-up vaccination period. Both HPV vaccines are most effective if given before any exposure to HPV infection (ie, before sexual activity). However, sexually active girls and women can receive some benefit from the vaccination because exposure to all HPV types prevented by the vaccines is unlikely in females aged 13 years through 26 years. Vaccination with either HPV vaccine is not recommended for pregnant women. It can be provided to women who are breastfeeding. The need for booster vaccination has not been established but appears unnecessary. Health care providers are encouraged to discuss with their patients the benefits and limitations of the HPV vaccine and the need for routine cervical cytology screening for those aged 21 years and older.

Background

HPV is a common sexually transmitted infection, with HPV acquisition generally occurring soon after first sexual activity. Most HPV infections are transient and asymptomatic. Persistent infections with high-risk (oncogenic) HPV types can lead to development of cervical, anal, penile, vaginal, vulvar, and oropharyngeal cancers, usually after several decades. Most new HPV infections occur in adolescents and young adults. Although most sexually active adults have been exposed to HPV, new infections can occur with a new sex partner.

Three prophylactic HPV vaccines are licensed for use in the United States: 9-valent (9vHPV, Gardasil 9, Merck), quadrivalent (4vHPV, Gardasil, Merck), and bivalent (2vHPV, Cervarix, GlaxoSmithKline). As of late 2016, only 9vHPV is distributed in the United States. The majority of HPV-associated cancers are caused by HPV 16 or 18, types targeted by all three vaccines. In addition, 4vHPV and 9vHPV target HPV 6 and 11, types that cause anogenital warts. 9vHPV also protects against five additional high-risk types: HPV 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58.

In October 2018, using results from 4vHPV clinical trials in women aged 24 through 45 years, and bridging immunogenicity and safety data in women and men, the Food and Drug Administration expanded the approved age range for 9vHPV use from 9 through 26 years to 9 through 45 years in women and men. In June 2019, after reviewing evidence related to HPV vaccination of adults, ACIP updated recommendations for catch-up vaccination and for vaccination of adults older than the recommended catch-up age.

Data synthesis

When pooling was considered feasible, we employed a random‐effects meta‐analysis using the DerSimonian and Laird method (DerSimonian 1986), as it was assumed that effect size might vary across studies and settings. We used data from the last available follow‐up for clinical and adverse event outcomes, with the number of participants (rather than the number of events) used in the analysis. For immunological outcomes, we extracted data from one month after the last HPV dose and at the longest‐term follow‐up.

To assess the harms associated with the HPV vaccine comparisons in this review, we recorded the methods used in each included study to collect adverse event data, and extracted data on common events that we determined a priori as: pain, swelling, redness at the injection site and overall systemic adverse events. For all serious adverse events reported in the included studies, we extracted the number of participants, participants with events and a description of the events. We also extracted information on whether the serious adverse events were considered to be related to the vaccines. We did not conduct statistical hypothesis testing because our protocol did not prespecify hypotheses about differences in the occurrence of any specific serious adverse event.

Why it is important to do this review

In practice, HPV vaccination rates in many countries remain low.

Simpler HPV immunisation schedules have been identified as a potential strategy to increase the coverage of vaccination (Walling 2016). The World Health Organization (WHO) recommended a two‐dose HPV vaccine schedule in 2014, based on a systematic review of studies with immunogenicity as the end‐point (D'Addario 2017; WHO 2017). As of 30 December 2017, 80 countries had fully introduced HPV vaccination and four countries had partially introduced HPV vaccination into their national immunisation programmes, with 65 countries having implemented a two‐dose schedule in girls 9 to 14 years old.

In 2018, a Cochrane Review concluded that the licensed three‐dose schedules of the bivalent and quadrivalent HPV vaccines result in limited adverse events and are effective against precancerous cervical lesions in females (Arbyn 2018). Since the 2014 WHO recommendation and original systematic review of two‐dose HPV vaccination schedules (D'Addario 2017; WHO 2017), the evidence base from RCTs about alternative vaccination schedules has expanded to include more data about the nonavalent HPV vaccine (Iversen 2016), about HPV vaccination in males, including MSM (Giuliano 2011), and amongst people living with HIV infection (Toft 2014). This review was initially commissioned in 2016 by the WHO Initiative for Vaccine Research to update the evidence for the two‐dose recommendation and is an update of D'Addario 2017. We produced a revised protocol for this update (Bergman 2017).

Cochrane Reviews usually include only RCTs with major clinical disease endpoints because RCTs provide the highest level of certainty about critical outcomes of interventions. However, precancer and cancer do not develop until many years after the acquisition of HPV infection, so it is difficult to determine the efficacy of vaccines against these outcomes. Persistent HPV infection is considered by the International Agency for Research on Cancer to be sufficient as a surrogate marker for cervical and anal cancer and non‐inferiority of immunogenicity is sufficient to bridge results to under‐16‐year‐olds. It is therefore important to document all infection and immunological outcomes measured in RCTs of HPV vaccines, even if the intended use of the vaccine is to prevent cancer.

This review aims to extend the evidence base on the efficacy and harms of HPV vaccines by including and evaluating RCTs of different HPV vaccines and different dose schedules in adolescent and adult females and males, as well as women and men living with HIV infection.

### Human papillomavirus vaccination 2020 guideline update: American cancer society guideline adaptation [^f572aa2d]. CA (2020). High credibility.

United States human papillomavirus (HPV)–attributable cancer burden and vaccine uptake — For the period from 2012 to 2016, an average of 34,800 cancers annually in the United States were attributable to HPV infection, and ninety-two percent of these cases (32,100) were attributable to the types targeted by the 9-valent HPV vaccine, the only vaccine formulation distributed in the United States since 2016. According to the National Immunization Survey-Teen, in 2018, 68.1% of adolescents (male and female) aged 13 to 17 years had received at least 1 dose of HPV vaccine, and 51.1% were up to date with the HPV vaccine series.

### Human papillomavirus vaccination: ACOG committee opinion, number 809 [^cd759357]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). High credibility.

Human papillomavirus vaccination — regulatory scope and core recommendations — notes that three vaccines covering 2, 4, or 9 HPV serotypes have been approved, with bivalent and quadrivalent vaccines approved for women and men aged 9–26 years, the 9‑valent vaccine approved for women and men aged 9–45 years, and the 9‑valent vaccine currently the only HPV vaccine available in the United States. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices and ACOG recommend routine HPV vaccination for girls and boys at 11–12 years, but it may be given from the age of 9 years. Obstetrician–gynecologists should assess and vaccinate adolescent girls and young women during the catch‑up period (ages 13–26 years) regardless of sexual activity, prior exposure to HPV, or sexual orientation if they were not vaccinated at 11–12 years. For previously unvaccinated women aged 27–45 years, clinicians may use shared clinical decision making regarding HPV vaccination.

### Moving forward: human papillomavirus vaccination and the prevention of cervical cancer [^cc67bfc0]. Journal of Women's Health (2007). Low credibility.

In June 2006, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the first human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine. The vaccine was subsequently recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices (ACIP) for routine vaccination of 11-12-year-old girls and catch-up vaccination of females 13–26 years of age. With the approval of the first HPV vaccine, cervical cancer now has a primary prevention tool. However, the availability of an HPV vaccine will not change the course of cervical cancer in this country unless there is both widespread demand by and access for the targeted populations. Demand will require recognition of the need for protection against HPV infection as well as a positive perception of the vaccine as safe and efficacious. General knowledge of HPV and its relationship to cervical cancer is limited; some parents and healthcare providers are hesitant to vaccinate preadolescent girls. Access to the expensive vaccine will not be increased without addressing financial constraints. Although the Vaccines for Children (VFC) program has added HPV to its vaccine plan, not all private insurers have approved coverage, and the uninsured and underinsured may have limited access. Moving forward will require a well-planned and executed public information campaign by trusted sources and the development of a comprehensive vaccine administration program. Although mandates would assure the broadest coverage, controversies surrounding mandates may deter work toward broad coverage. States should focus on developing a comprehensive program and then return to the mandate issue if coverage does not meet public health objectives.

### Human papillomavirus vaccine update [^fa4baf06]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Rates of cancers attributable to human papillomavirus (HPV) are rising. A safe and extremely effective vaccine is available to prevent many of these cancers. Studies have shown that health care providers' recommendation to immunize is the most important factor in parents' decision. Parents of all adolescent boys and girls should receive a strong and unequivocal recommendation to vaccinate their child against HPV at the 11- or 12-year-old well child visit. Ideally, adolescents complete their HPV vaccine series by their 13th birthday, leading to greater immune response and protection before most adolescents are exposed to sexually transmitted HPV.

### An update on human papillomavirus vaccination in the United States [^678d14b1]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). Medium credibility.

Cervical cancer remains a significant disease in the United States. Although the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine has been approved for those aged 9–26 years and for some individuals up to age 45 years, there are many circumstances in which health care professionals may not know whether the vaccine should be recommended, such as for patients with previous infection, health care workers, and those older than age 26 years. This article highlights the evidence that the HPV vaccine is a safe and highly effective way to prevent cervical cancer, with the strongest predictor of vaccine uptake being practitioner recommendation.

### Understanding and learning from the success of prophylactic human papillomavirus vaccines [^d7744eb2]. Nature Reviews: Microbiology (2012). Medium credibility.

An estimated 5% of human cancers are caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) infections, and most of these cancers are of the cervix. Two prophylactic HPV vaccines that target the two most oncogenic virus types, HPV16 and HPV18, are now commercially available. In controlled clinical trials, the vaccines proved to be effective at preventing incident anogenital infection and the associated neoplastic disease that is induced by these virus types. Here, we highlight the specific aspects of HPV biology and vaccine composition that are likely to contribute to the efficacy of these vaccines, and we discuss how these particular features might or might not be relevant for the development of effective vaccines against other sexually transmitted viruses such as HIV and herpes simplex virus (HSV).

### Recent advances in human papillomavirus vaccines [^5a76709c]. Current Oncology Reports (2006). Low credibility.

The human papillomavirus (HPV) is one of the most common sexually transmitted infections and the etiologic agent of cervical dysplasia and cancer. Recent research on the safety and efficacy of prophylactic vaccines against HPV has shown promising results with nearly 100% efficacy in preventing persistent infections and cervical dysplasia. Several approaches are being tested in therapeutic vaccine clinical trials whereby E6, E7, or both agents are administered in live viral vectors, as proteins, or in nucleic acid form. Cell-based therapeutic vaccines are also being tested. HPV vaccines have the potential to eradicate a major cancer and source of morbidity around the world.

### Development of therapeutic HPV vaccines [^c89f99bb]. The Lancet: Oncology (2009). Medium credibility.

At least 15% of human malignant diseases are attributable to the consequences of persistent viral or bacterial infection. Chronic infection with oncogenic human papillomavirus (HPV) types is a necessary, but insufficient, cause in the development of more cancers than any other virus. Currently available prophylactic vaccines have no therapeutic effect for established infection or for disease. Early disease is characterised by tissue sequestration. However, because a proportion of intraepithelial HPV-associated disease undergoes immune-mediated regression, the development of immunotherapeutic strategies is an opportunity to determine proof-of-principle for therapeutic vaccines. In this Review, we discuss recent progress in this field and priorities for future clinical investigations.

### Comparison of different human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine types and dose schedules for prevention of HPV-related disease in females and males [^2a79f560]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

With regard to serious adverse events, there is a large degree of uncertainty in the evidence comparing different HPV vaccines and different dose schedules. The 'Summary of findings' tables show low numbers of serious adverse events and deaths in most included studies. Even when the total number of events is high (e.g. Joura 2015), specific events of clinical relevance are still too rare for meaningful comparative analyses. In this review, we used a composite outcome, that is, the overall frequency of serious adverse events, for each comparison, however, analyses based on a composite outcome can produce results that are difficult to interpret for several reasons. This outcome can include events that are not clinically relevant or are not biologically related to the vaccine (Lineberry 2016), occur outside a plausible time frame relative to vaccine exposure (Huang 2011), or are not based on standardised definitions (Bonhoeffer 2002). In addition, trials measure serious adverse events at different time points and there is a large variation in duration of follow‐up, which could produce misleading summary estimates (Huang 2011). Finally, there is heterogeneity among trials with regard to the age and gender of participants and clinical measurements of serious adverse events (Appendix 4). Meta‐analyses of serious adverse events, such as those presented in this review, should be considered exploratory rather than confirmatory as the analyses are not planned in advance (i.e. when the included studies were designed) (Huang 2011). Despite the uncertainty in the evidence about harms when comparing different HPV vaccines and dose schedules, a previous systematic review reported similar rates of serious adverse events when HPV vaccines were compared to control (Arbyn 2018).

Quality of the evidence

The risk of bias of the included studies in this review is generally low. We rated studies that received funding from the vaccine manufacturer as 'unclear' for the 'other risk of bias' domain. This judgement was based on the results of a systematic review which showed more favourable efficacy results and conclusions in studies sponsored by manufacturing companies (Lundh 2017). It has been suggested that industry sponsorship of studies results in overly positive results through a variety of choices in the design and conduct of the trials that leads to bias. Based on the low risk of bias in other methodological domains and adequate reporting in the trials, we did not downgrade the certainty of the evidence using GRADE for this factor. In accordance with Higgins 2017, information on industry sponsorship and other funding sources is captured in the Characteristics of included studies tables.

### Trends in human papillomavirus vaccine safety concerns and adverse event reporting in the United States [^26c3f334]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Does public sentiment of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine safety align with spontaneous HPV vaccine adverse event reporting data?

Findings

This cross-sectional analysis of the 2015 to 2018 National Immunization Survey indicates a 79.9% increase in the proportion of parents who refused the HPV vaccine for their adolescents due to safety concerns. In contrast, estimates from the national vaccine safety surveillance system found that the HPV vaccine adverse event reporting rate per 100 000 doses distributed decreased from 44.7 in 2015 to 29.4 in 2018.

Meaning

These findings suggest an urgent need to combat safety concerns about the HPV vaccine in the US.

Adults (27–45 years) — the HPV vaccine is licensed in the United States for women and men through age 45 years. Although administration is safe in patients aged 27–45 and can prevent new infections in women not previously exposed, most women in this age range will already have been exposed to HPV, and the overall public health benefit in women aged 27–45 years is markedly diminished compared with use in the target age range. For previously unvaccinated women aged 27–45 years, clinicians may use shared clinical decision making regarding HPV vaccination.

### Current and future vaccine clinical research with the licensed 2-, 4-, and 9-valent VLP HPV vaccines: what's ongoing, what's needed? [^186c9610]. Preventive Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Prophylactic HPV vaccination has been a great public health success. For > 20 years, clinical trials were conducted with the 2-, 4-, and/or 9-valent vaccines in young-adult females, mid-adult women, males, and adolescents. In all studies, the vaccines were highly efficacious, immunogenic, and well tolerated. Following vaccine licensure and utilization in national vaccine programs globally (real-world settings primarily in high income countries), numerous studies demonstrated that the vaccines continue to have an excellent safety profile and have dramatically reduced the incidence of genital warts, HPV vaccine-type prevalence, and precancerous lesions. Thirty-eight clinical trials with the currently licensed HPV vaccines are ongoing. Key questions being addressed in new trials include: efficacy against persistent infection and immunogenicity of a 1-dose regimen; efficacy of 3 doses in 20-45-year-old females; use in postpartum women and immunocompromised individuals (HIV, liver and kidney transplants); dose sparing via intradermal administration; use in combination with a PD1 monoclonal antibody in patients with cervical cancer; impact on recurrent disease in women undergoing cervical conization; persistence of protection; and use to prevent oropharyngeal cancer. Additional clinical research that should be conducted includes: long-term follow-up, particularly of 1- and 2-dose regimens; further evaluation of flexible 2-dose regimens; immunogenicity of 1- or 2-dose regimens in persons ≥ 15 years old and immunocompromised populations; safety and immunogenicity of 1 or 2 doses in children < 9 years old; assessment of the vaccine in the prevention of transmission; interchangeability with newer HPV vaccines; additional concomitant use studies; and prevention of penile cancer and recurrent respiratory papillomatosis.

### Monitoring effect of human papillomavirus vaccines in US population, emerging infections program, 2008–2012 [^bcdb4dd4]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines are primarily designed to prevent HPV-associated cancers that typically occur years to decades after exposure to HPV-16 and -18. Three prophylactic HPV vaccines are available in the United States: bivalent, quadrivalent, and 9-valent vaccines. The bivalent vaccine protects against HPV-16 and -18, the most common oncogenic HPV types, which are responsible for ≈70% of HPV-associated cervical cancers and a large proportion of other HPV-related cancers. The quadrivalent vaccine also protects against HPV-16 and -18 and against HPV-6 and -11, two nononcogenic HPV types that cause genital warts and respiratory papillomatosis. The 9-valent vaccine also protects against HPV-6, -11, -16, and -18 and against 5 other oncogenic types: HPV-31, -33, -45, -52, and -58.

Since June 2006, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) has recommended routine HPV vaccination of girls 11–26 or 12–26 years of age who have not previously been administered the quadrivalent vaccine. After licensure of the bivalent vaccine against HPV-16 and -18 in 2009, the ACIP guidelines for vaccination of women and girls were expanded to recommend quadrivalent or bivalent vaccine for protection against HPV types that can cause cancer. The 9-valent vaccine was licensed in 2014, and in February 2015, ACIP included it as one of 3 recommended HPV vaccines. To date, the quadrivalent vaccine accounts for almost all HPV vaccines distributed.

Postlicensure surveillance activities include a range of early, mid, and late biological outcomes for the timely monitoring of the effects of the vaccines in the population. In the United States, type-specific HPV infection and genital warts are being monitored in a variety of settings to evaluate the earliest evidence of vaccine effect, and HPV-associated cancers are monitored through the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)–administered National Program of Cancer Registries, which cover the entire US population.

### Human papillomavirus vaccine effectiveness against HPV infection: evaluation of one, two, and three doses [^289aee57]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Highly effective human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines are used in many national programs in 3- or 2-dose schedules. We examined HPV vaccine effectiveness against HPV prevalence by number of doses.

Methods

We collected residual liquid-based cytology samples from US women aged 20–29 years who were screened for cervical cancer. Women continuously enrolled from 2006 through the specimen collection date were analyzed. Specimens were tested using the Linear Array assay. We analyzed prevalence of quadrivalent HPV vaccine (4vHPV) types (HPV 6,11,16,18) and other HPV-type categories and determined prevalence ratios (PRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for 1, 2, and 3 compared with no vaccine doses.

Results

Among 4269 women, 1052 (24.6%) were unvaccinated, 2610 (61.1%) received 3 doses, 304 (7.1%) received 2 doses, and 303 (7.1%) received 1 dose. The 4vHPV-type prevalence was 7.4% among unvaccinated women compared with 1.7%, 1.0%, and 1.0% among 1-, 2-, and 3-dose recipients. Among women vaccinated at ≤ 18 years, adjusted PRs for 1, 2, and 3 doses were 0.06 (95% CI, 0.01–0.42), 0.05 (95% CI, 0.01–0.39), and 0.06 (95% CI, 0.04–0.12).

Conclusions

Among women who received their first dose at age ≤ 18, estimated HPV vaccine effectiveness was high regardless of number of doses.

### Optimal human papillomavirus vaccination strategies in the context of vaccine supply constraints in 100 countries [^0feb41c2]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Countries are recommended to immunise adolescent girls routinely with one or two doses of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines to eliminate cervical cancer as a public health problem. With most existing vaccine doses absorbed by countries (mostly high-income) with existing HPV vaccination programmes, limited supply has been left for new country introductions until 2022; many of those, low- and middle-income countries with higher mortality. Several vaccination strategies were considered by the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization to allow more countries to introduce vaccination despite constrained supplies.

Methods

We examined the impact of nine strategies for allocating limited vaccine doses to 100 pre-introduction countries from 2020 to 2030. Two algorithms were used to optimise the total number of cancer deaths that can be averted worldwide by a limited number of doses (knapsack and decreasing order of country-specific mortality rates), and an unoptimised algorithm (decreasing order of Human Development Index) were used.

Findings

Routinely vaccinating 14-year-old girls with either one or two doses and switching to a routine 9-year-old programme when supply is no longer constrained could prevent the most cervical cancer deaths, regardless of allocation algorithm. The unoptimised allocation averts fewer deaths because it allocates first to higher-income countries, usually with lower cervical cancer mortality.

Interpretation

To optimise the deaths averted through vaccination when supply is limited, it is important to prioritise high-burden countries and vaccinating older girls first.

### Efficacy, effectiveness and safety of vaccination against human papillomavirus in males: a systematic review [^80e7f4af]. BMC Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination is safe and effective in preventing cervical cancer in females. As HPV infections can also induce cancers of the anus, penis and oral cavity, male vaccination is also advocated, but systematic reviews on efficacy and safety in males are lacking.

Methods

We performed a systematic review on the efficacy, effectiveness and safety of HPV vaccination in males of any age. MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched from inception to April 2017.

Results

We identified 5196 articles and seven studies (four randomized controlled trials (RCTs), three non-randomized studies) were included, comprising a total of 5294 participants. Vaccine efficacy against at least 6-month persisting anogenital HPV 16 infections was 46.9% (95% confidence interval (CI) 28.6–60.8%), whereas efficacy against persisting oral infections was 88% (2–98%). A vaccine efficacy of 61.9% (21.4–82.8%) and 46.8% (-20 to -77.9%) was observed against anal intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 and grade 3 lesions, respectively. No meaningful estimates were available on vaccine efficacy or effectiveness against penile intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or 3, and no data were identified for anal, penile or head and neck squamous cell cancer. In participants who were HPV-seronegative and PCR-negative at enrolment, efficacy against all outcomes was higher as compared to seropositive and/or PCR-positive individuals. Risk of bias was low in three RCTs and high in one, while the three non-randomized studies were at serious to critical risk of bias. Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation evidence quality was moderate to low for most outcomes.

Conclusions

HPV vaccination in males is moderately effective against persistent anogenital HPV infection and high-grade anal intraepithelial lesions in studies where the population consists mainly of HPV-infected males. Vaccine effectiveness was high in study groups comprising HPV-naïve males. This supports a recommendation for vaccination of boys before the onset of sexual activity with the goal of establishing optimal vaccine-induced protection. Mathematical modelling studies will still be needed to assess the effects of adding males to existing HPV vaccination programs in females.

### Use of 9-valent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine: updated HPV vaccination recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices [^70a2db05]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2015). Medium credibility.

HPV-associated disease burden in the United States — HPV is associated with cervical, vulvar, and vaginal cancer in females, penile cancer in males, and anal cancer and oropharyngeal cancer in both females and males, and the burden also includes cervical precancers such as cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or 3 and adenocarcinoma in situ (≥ CIN2). In the United States, approximately 64% of invasive HPV-associated cancers are attributable to HPV 16 or 18 (65% for females; 63% for males; approximately 21,300 cases annually) and 10% are attributable to the five additional types in 9vHPV: HPV 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58 (14% for females; 4% for males; approximately 3,400 cases annually). HPV 16 or 18 account for 66% and the five additional types for about 15% of cervical cancers, and approximately 50% of ≥ CIN2 are caused by HPV 16 or 18 and 25% by the five additional types.

### Human papillomavirus vaccine trials and tribulations: vaccine efficacy [^aa0a2452]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

As of December 2014, there were 3 approved vaccines for human papillomavirus (HPV): bivalent Cervarix (GlaxoSmithKline, New York, NY), quadrivalent Gardasil (Merck and Co, Kenilworth, NJ), and 9-valent Gardasil-9 (Merck and Co). The average cost per dose is $120, with a recommended 3-dose course. The quadrivalent vaccine is the most widely administered worldwide. As with the bivalent and 9-valent vaccines, the vaccine is considered safe, although concerns have been raised. In addition to immunization against the targeted HPV types, there is evidence that there is cross protection against other types of HPV. This continuing medical education review evaluates the differences in vaccines that are currently on the market; part II focuses on the cost-effectiveness of vaccination, the HPV vaccination programs currently instituted around the globe, efficacy, and safety.

### Human papillomavirus vaccination for adults: updated recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices [^d67b6386]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2019). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Adolescents remain the most important focus of the HPV vaccination program in the United States. Recommendations harmonized across genders will simplify the immunization schedule and be more feasible to implement. HPV vaccination is most effective when given before exposure to any HPV, as in early adolescence. Clinical trials have indicated that HPV vaccines are safe and effective against infection and disease attributable to HPV vaccine types that recipients are not infected with at the time of vaccination.

Because HPV acquisition generally occurs soon after first sexual activity, vaccine effectiveness will be lower in older age groups because of prior infections. Some previously exposed adults will have developed natural immunity already. Exposure to HPV decreases among older age groups. Evidence suggests that although HPV vaccination is safe for adults aged 27 through 45 years, population benefit would be minimal; nevertheless, some adults who are not adequately vaccinated might be at risk for new HPV infection and might benefit from vaccination in this age range.

The extent of cross-protection is a key element in the choice of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine to use in vaccination programmes. We compared the cross-protective efficacy of the bivalent vaccine (HPV 16 and 18; Cervarix, GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals, Rixensart, Belgium) and quadrivalent vaccine (HPV 6, 11, 16, and 18; Gardasil, Merck, Whitehouse Station, NJ, USA) against non-vaccine type HPVs.

Methods

We searched Medline and Embase databases, conference abstracts, and manufacturers' websites for randomised clinical trials assessing the efficacy of bivalent and quadrivalent vaccines against persistent infections (lasting ≥ 6 months) and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) associated with the non-vaccine type HPVs (types 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58). We included studies of participants who were HPV DNA negative before vaccination for all HPV types assessed. We assessed heterogeneity in vaccine efficacy estimates between trials with I² and χ² statistics.

Findings

We identified two clinical trials (Females United to Unilaterally Reduce Endo/Ectocervical Disease [FUTURE] I and II) of the quadrivalent vaccine and three (Papilloma Trial Against Cancer In Young Adults [PATRICIA], HPV007, and HPV-023) of the bivalent vaccine. Analysis of the most comparable populations (pooled FUTURE I/II data vs PATRICIA) suggested that cross-protective vaccine efficacy estimates against infections and lesions associated with HPV 31, 33, and 45 were usually higher for the bivalent vaccine than the quadrivalent vaccine. Vaccine efficacy in the bivalent trial was higher than it was in the quadrivalent trial against persistent infections with HPV 31 (77.1% [95% CI 67.2 to 84.4] for bivalent vaccine vs 46.2% [15.3 to 66.4] for quadrivalent vaccine; p = 0.003) and HPV 45 (79.0% [61.3 to 89.4] vs 7.8% [-67.0 to 49.3]; p = 0.0003), and against CIN grade 2 or worse associated with HPV 33 (82.3% [53.4 to 94.7] vs 24.0% [-71.2 to 67.2]; p = 0.02) and HPV 45 (100% [41.7 to 100] vs -51.9% [-1717.8 to 82.6]; p = 0.04). We noted substantial heterogeneity between vaccine efficacy in bivalent trials against persistent infections with HPV 31 (I² = 69%, p = 0.04) and HPV 45 (I² = 70%, p = 0.04), with apparent reductions in cross-protective efficacy with increased follow-up.

Interpretation

The bivalent vaccine seems more efficacious against non-vaccine HPV types 31, 33, and 45 than the quadrivalent vaccine, but the differences were not all significant and might be attributable to differences in trial design. Efficacy against persistent infections with types 31 and 45 seemed to decrease in bivalent trials with increased follow-up, suggesting a waning of cross-protection; more data are needed to establish duration of cross-protection.

### Effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of human papillomavirus vaccination through age 45 years in the United States [^daa0364b]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

In the United States, the routine age for human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination is 11 to 12 years, with catch-up vaccination through age 26 years for women and 21 years for men. U.S. vaccination policy on use of the 9-valent HPV vaccine in adult women and men is being reviewed.

Objective

To evaluate the added population-level effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of extending the current U.S. HPV vaccination program to women aged 27 to 45 years and men aged 22 to 45 years.

Design

The analysis used HPV-ADVISE (Agent-based Dynamic model for VaccInation and Screening Evaluation), an individual-based transmission dynamic model of HPV infection and associated diseases, calibrated to age-specific U.S. data.

Data Sources

Published data.

Target Population

Women aged 27 to 45 years and men aged 22 to 45 years in the United States.

Time Horizon

100 years.

Perspective

Health care sector.

Intervention

9-valent HPV vaccination.

Outcome Measures

HPV-associated outcomes prevented and cost-effectiveness ratios.

Results Of Base-Case Analysis

The model predicts that the current U.S. HPV vaccination program will reduce the number of diagnoses of anogenital warts and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia of grade 2 or 3 and cases of cervical cancer and noncervical HPV-associated cancer by 82%, 80%, 59%, and 39%, respectively, over 100 years and is cost saving (vs. no vaccination). In contrast, extending vaccination to women and men aged 45 years is predicted to reduce these outcomes by an additional 0.4, 0.4, 0.2, and 0.2 percentage points, respectively. Vaccinating women and men up to age 30, 40, and 45 years is predicted to cost $830 000, $1 843 000, and $1 471 000, respectively, per quality-adjusted life-year gained (vs. current vaccination).

Results Of Sensitivity Analysis

Results were most sensitive to assumptions about natural immunity and progression rates after infection, historical vaccination coverage, and vaccine efficacy.

Limitation

Uncertainty about the proportion of HPV-associated disease due to infections after age 26 years and about the level of herd effects from the current HPV vaccination program.

Conclusion

The current HPV vaccination program is predicted to be cost saving. Extending vaccination to older ages is predicted to produce small additional health benefits and result in substantially higher incremental cost-effectiveness ratios than the current recommendation.

### Human papillomavirus vaccination and cervical cancer risk [^4eb73827]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Persistent human papillomavirus infection is the central cause of cervical cancer, the leading cause of cancer death among women worldwide. Clear evidence from both randomized trials and population based studies shows that vaccination against human papillomavirus reduces the incidence of cervical pre-cancer. These data suggest that the vaccine reduces the incidence of cervical cancer. However, human papillomavirus vaccine coverage is inadequate in all countries, especially in low and middle income countries where disease burden is highest. Supply side strategies to improve coverage include increasing the availability of low cost vaccines, school located delivery, single dose vaccine schedules, and development of vaccines that do not need refrigeration. Demand side strategies include enhancing provider recommendations, correcting misinformation, and public awareness campaigns. The near elimination of cervical cancer is achievable through increased uptake of human papillomavirus vaccination and efforts to increase screening for cervical cancer, especially when enacted to reduce disparities in across the world.

### Human papillomavirus vaccinations: provider education to enhance vaccine uptake [^44d5f11e]. Clinical Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the number one sexually transmitted infection (STI) worldwide. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) approximated that 92% of HPV-related cancers might be prevented by receiving the HPV 9-valent vaccine (Gardasil 9). The 2-dose HPV vaccine for children ages 11 to 12 years provides almost 100% protection against strains affiliated with cervical, vaginal, and vulvar cancers. Provider education is essential to decrease clinical knowledge deficits and increase vaccination uptake. Evidence-based provider recommendations expressed to eligible individuals improves vaccination rates. Evidence-based approaches for vaccine-hesitant parents involve using the presumptive announcement approach, asking for and addressing main concerns, and trying again if the parent initially declines. Seventy percent of parents who initially decide not to get their child vaccinated later agree to the vaccine or schedule a follow-up appointment. The CDC guidelines for HPV vaccinations, including the catch-up and adult guidelines, are reviewed. A clinical vignette with case scenarios and a Q&A quiz are included.

### Human papillomavirus vaccines [^10c424c1]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the pharmacology, efficacy, safety, tolerability, and pharmacoeconomics of Cervarix and Gardasil, 2 human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines.

Data Sources

English-language articles were obtained by MEDLINE search (1966-February 2006) using the key words human papillomavirus vaccine, Cervarix, and Gardasil. Bibliographies of selected articles were used to identify additional sources.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All available published articles or abstracts reporting the results of human studies of HPV vaccines were reviewed for inclusion in this article. Additional information about ongoing clinical trials was obtained from manufacturers' Web sites.

Data Synthesis

Cervarix and Gardasil are recombinant vaccines against HPV. Cervarix targets HPV-16 and -18, which are responsible for 70% of cervical cancers. Gardasil also targets HPV-16 and -18, plus the HPV-6 and -11 types responsible for more than 80% of genital warts. Both vaccines have been effective in preventing persistent infection with targeted HPV types and in preventing cervical intraepithelial lesions, while Gardasil has also been effective in preventing vulvar and vaginal neoplasia and genital warts. Both vaccines have been well tolerated, with the most common adverse effects occurring at the injection site. Phase III trials are ongoing to further evaluate vaccine efficacy.

Conclusions

Cervarix and Gardasil are effective for prevention of HPV infection and cervical lesions. Issues remaining to be addressed include duration of protection, efficacy for prevention of cervical cancer, optimal age for vaccination, feasibility of application to the developing world, the ideal combination of HPV subtypes, and the most efficient combination of vaccination and cervical cancer screening.

### The comparative safety of human papillomavirus vaccines: a Bayesian network meta-analysis [^4b2d8083]. Journal of Medical Virology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

The safety of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines, one of the major challenges to public vaccination, has been controversial. This study assessed the adverse reactions of various HPV vaccines, including bivalent HPV (2vHPV), quadrivalent HPV (4vHPV), and 9-valent HPV (9vHPV) vaccines.

Methods

PubMed, Embase, and Central databases were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the comparative safety of HPV vaccines. A network meta-analysis was performed based on the Bayesian framework random-effects model.

Results

This study included 23 RCTs. Analysis across these reports indicated that the 2vHPV vaccine was associated with significantly more systemic adverse events than the 4vHPV vaccine (risk ratio [RR]: 1.28, 95% credible interval [CrI]: 1.14–1.44), 9vHPV vaccine (RR: 1.25, 95% CrI: 1.06–1.49), and placebo (RR: 1.31, 95% CrI: 1.18–1.46). However, there were no statistically significant differences in serious adverse events between the vaccinated and placebo groups. For injection-site adverse events, there were substantial inconsistencies between the direct and indirect effects; therefore, the analysis results of the safety were presented only for systemic and serious adverse events.

Conclusions

The 2vHPV vaccine resulted in more systemic adverse events than other vaccines and placebo. No significant differences in serious adverse events were observed. Further studies are needed to obtain more information regarding the safety of HPV vaccines.

### Human papillomavirus vaccination: ACOG committee opinion, number 809 [^c8b1e324]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). High credibility.

Human papillomavirus vaccination — routine and catch-up guidance emphasizes early adolescent initiation and strong clinician recommendation. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices and ACOG recommend routine human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination for girls and boys at the target age of 11–12 years (but it may be given from the age of 9 years) as part of the adolescent immunization platform, and obstetrician–gynecologists should assess and vaccinate adolescent girls and young women during the catch-up period (ages 13–26 years) if not vaccinated at 11–12 years. Unvaccinated women age 26 years and younger should receive the HPV vaccine series regardless of sexual activity, prior exposure to HPV, or sexual orientation. Obstetrician–gynecologists and other health care professionals should strongly recommend HPV vaccination, should educate parents in their decision making for daughters and sons, and are encouraged to stock and administer HPV vaccines when feasible. HPV vaccines are characterized as among the most effective available, with data demonstrating greater than 99% efficacy when given before exposure to that HPV type.

### FDA licensure of bivalent human papillomavirus vaccine (HPV2, cervarix) for use in females and updated HPV vaccination recommendations from the advisory committee on immunization practices (ACIP) [^c6a44abf]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2010). Low credibility.

On October 16, 2009, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) licensed bivalent human papillomavirus vaccine (HPV2; Cervarix, GlaxoSmithKline) for use in females aged 10 through 25 years. Cervarix is the second human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine licensed for use in females in the United States. Quadrivalent HPV vaccine (HPV4; Gardasil, Merck & Co, Inc.) was licensed in 2006 for use in females aged 9 through 26 years, and the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended routine HPV4 vaccination of females aged 11 or 12 years, and catch-up vaccination for females aged 13 through 26 years. This report provides updated recommendations for routine and catch-up vaccination of females with either HPV2 or HPV4.

We reported relative risks (ORs or RRs) in the Effects of interventions section for all relevant outcomes, but where the evidence was of very low‐certainty we reported the number of events in each group only.

Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity

We performed subgroup meta‐analyses where possible, using vaccine type, gender, and age group (9 to 15 years; 16 to 26 years) as stratifying variables.

Sensitivity analysis

We carried out one post‐hoc sensitivity analysis for outcomes using a Mantel‐Haenszel odds ratio where events were very rare (i.e. an event rate of < 1% across both trial arms). We compared the results of the primary analysis calculated with Mantel‐Haenzsel methods against those with Peto methods (Bradburn 2007). We also planned to conduct sensitivity analyses for the primary outcomes according to allocation concealment (high risk of bias, low risk of bias, and unclear risk of bias) for outcomes for which data could not be pooled because of considerable heterogeneity (I² > 75%).

### Human papillomavirus vaccination 2020 guideline update: American cancer society guideline adaptation [^028b9cff]. CA (2020). High credibility.

ACIP routine HPV vaccination ages and ACS qualifying statement with rationale indicate that ACIP recommends HPV vaccination at age 11 or 12 years and that vaccination can be given starting at age 9 years, and ACS states that routine HPV vaccination between ages 9 and 12 years is expected to achieve higher on-time vaccination rates and encourages providers to start the series at age 9 or 10 years. The ACIP basis included that the vaccine can be administered as young as age 9 years, high antibody titers after vaccination at age 11 or 12 years, and the established young adolescent visit at age 11 or 12 years. Evidence summarized notes that HPV vaccination has been shown to be more effective at younger ages, that vaccinating at age 12 or 13 years is significantly more effective than vaccinating at age 14 or 15 years, that vaccinating at ages 9 to 11 years will be at least as effective and will likely result in a stronger immune response, and that vaccination has shown no sign of protection waning over time.

### Anal carcinoma, version 2.2023, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^d5e144da]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2023). High credibility.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination — prevention and recommendations: A 9-valent HPV vaccine protecting against HPV-6, -11, -16, -18, -31, -33, -45, -52, and -58 is available, and targeting the additional strains over the quadrivalent vaccine is predicted to prevent an additional 464 cases of anal cancer annually. Compared with the quadrivalent vaccine, the 9-valent vaccine was noninferior for antibody response to HPV-6, -11, -16, and -18, and its calculated efficacy was 96.7% (95% CI, 80.9–99.8) for prevention of high-grade cervical, vulvar, or vaginal disease related to these strains, with sustained efficacy and immunogenicity aiding prevention of HPV incidence after 10 years post-vaccination. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends routine use of the 9-valent vaccine in children aged 11 and 12 years and catch-up vaccination through 26 years of age for those not previously vaccinated; the U.S. Food and Drug Administration expanded use to individuals aged 27 through 45 years, and in 2019 the ACIP voted to recommend vaccination based on shared clinical decision-making for individuals in this age range who are not adequately vaccinated.

### Use of 9-valent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine: updated HPV vaccination recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices [^1687e738]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2015). Medium credibility.

9vHPV immunogenicity across ages — Geometric mean antibody titers (GMTs) 1 month after the third dose were noninferior for HPV 6, 11, 16, and 18, and in the 9vHPV group, > 99% seroconverted to all nine HPV vaccine types. Two immunobridging trials included approximately 2,400 females and males aged 9 through 15 years versus approximately 400 females aged 16 through 26 years with over 99% seroconversion; another trial comparing 4vHPV with 9vHPV in approximately 600 adolescent females aged 9 through 15 years showed 100% seroconversion to HPV 6, 11, 16, and 18 in both groups with noninferior GMTs for 9vHPV. In males aged 16 through 26 years, > 99% seroconverted and GMTs were noninferior to those in females. Noninferior immunogenicity of 9vHPV compared with 4vHPV was used to infer efficacy for HPV 6, 11, 16, and 18.

### Declines in prevalence of human papillomavirus vaccine-type infection among females after introduction of vaccine-United States, 2003–2018 [^6b973093]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2021). Medium credibility.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common sexually transmitted infection in the United States (1). Although most infections resolve without clinical sequalae, persistent HPV infection can cause cervical, other anogenital, and oropharyngeal cancers and anogenital warts. HPV vaccination has been recommended in the United States at age 11–12 years since 2006 for females and since 2011 for males. Catch-up vaccination is recommended through age 26 years.* A quadrivalent vaccine (4vHPV) targeting types 6, 11, 16, and 18 was mainly used until 2015, when a 9-valent vaccine (9vHPV), targeting the same four types as 4vHPV and five additional types (31, 33, 45, 52, and 58), was introduced; 9vHPV has been the only vaccine available in the United States since the end of 2016 (2). HPV vaccination coverage has increased but remains lower than that of other vaccinations recommended for adolescents (3). A decrease in prevalence of 4vHPV types detected in cervicovaginal swabs among young females from the prevaccine era (2003–2006) to 2007–2010 in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) was an early indicator of vaccine impact (2) and was also observed in later periods (4,5). NHANES data from 2017–2018 were included in this analysis to update HPV prevalence estimates among females aged 14–34 years. From the prevaccine era to 2015–2018, significant decreases in 4vHPV-type prevalence occurred among females aged 14–19 years (88%) and 20–24 years (81%). In sexually experienced females, 4vHPV-type prevalence decreased in those who reported receiving ≥ 1 HPV vaccine dose (97% among those aged 14–19 years, 86% among those aged 20–24 years) and in those who reported no vaccination (87% among those aged 14–19 years, 65% among those aged 20–24 years). Significant declines among unvaccinated females suggest herd effects. These data show increasing impact of HPV vaccination in the United States. HPV vaccination is a critical prevention tool against HPV infection, anogenital warts, and HPV-attributable precancers and cancers. HPV vaccination is highly effective and is recommended routinely at age 11–12 years and through 26 years for persons not already vaccinated.

### Efficacy, effectiveness and safety of vaccination against human papillomavirus in males: a systematic review [^07742f2d]. BMC Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Data extraction

From the eligible studies, two independent reviewers (TH, MWP) used standardized forms to extract study characteristics and assess methodological quality. In case of disagreement, a final decision was made by consensus. The corresponding authors or principal investigators of three studies were contacted for additional data and information. The following data were extracted: study location, study design, study period, inclusion criteria, exclusion criteria, age at enrolment, duration of follow-up, vaccine used, comparator, study sponsorship, conflict of interests, number (proportion) of vaccinated participants with outcome, number (proportion) of control participants with outcome, unadjusted estimates, adjusted estimates, confounders.

Assessment of risk of bias and quality of evidence

For randomized controlled trials (RCTs), the Cochrane risk of bias tool was used to assess the following domains: random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants and personnel, blinding of outcome assessment, incomplete outcome data, selective reporting, other bias. Studies were categorized as being at "high risk", "low risk" or "unclear risk" of bias. For non-randomized studies, the Risk Of Bias in Non-randomized Studies - of Interventions (ROBINS-I) tool was used, comprising the following domains: bias due to confounding, bias in selection of participants into the study, bias in classification of interventions, bias due to deviations from intended interventions, bias due to missing data, bias in measurement of outcomes, bias in selection of the reported results. Risk of bias was categorized as being "low risk", "moderate risk", "serious risk" or "critical risk".

The methodology of the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) working group was used to assess the quality of the evidence.

Statistical analysis

Abstracted data were aggregated in tables. Risk ratios, odds ratios, risk differences and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were either calculated or extracted from the publications. Vaccine efficacy and vaccine effectiveness were either extracted from the publications or calculated as [1-(risk ratio or rate ratio comparing vaccine and control recipients)] × 100. Since only one study per outcome and study design was identified in this review, no meta-analyses were performed. According to the review protocol, analyses were performed in two subgroups: (1) all study participants, irrespective of HPV infection at enrolment, and (2) study participants who were seronegative and PCR-negative for the relevant HPV types at enrolment.

### Comparison of different human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine types and dose schedules for prevention of HPV-related disease in females and males [^e9e050ef]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Two studies found that two doses of HPV vaccine resulted in little to no difference in pain at the injection site compared with three doses of HPV vaccine (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.03; 2 studies; 1189 participants; Analysis 1.1), but reduced swelling (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.89; 2 studies; 1189 participants; Analysis 1.2) and redness (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.96; 2 studies; 1189 participants; Analysis 1.3) at the injection site at up to seven days follow‐up. The comparative evidence about serious adverse events was considered to be of very low‐certainty (risk with two doses 36/1158, risk with three doses 35/1159; 4 studies; 2317 participants; Analysis 1.4). We downgraded certainty for imprecision and indirectness of the composite measure of all serious adverse events, which may or may not be clinically relevant, may or may not be related to the vaccine, and may occur outside a biologically plausible time frame relative to vaccine exposure. Two of the studies reported on withdrawals from the study and reported that no participants had withdrawn because of adverse events. One death was reported in the three‐dose group (1/898) and no deaths (0/899) in the two‐dose group (OR 0.33, 95% CI 0.01 to 8.19; 3 studies; 1797 participants; low‐certainty evidence; Analysis 1.5).

### Effects of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination programmes on community rates of HPV-related disease and harms from vaccination [^3ba0bdac]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Data synthesis

The inclusion of various study designs in this review that use different estimation methods and statistical models means that we calculated different measures of effect and interpret these separately. We carried out quantitative and qualitative data syntheses separately for effectiveness and safety (harms).

We grouped studies for quantitative analysis according to study design (see Types of studies and Appendix 1) and outcome. Where possible, we stratified analyses by age at vaccination, sex, type of vaccine and outcome time point. We analysed all outcomes according to time from first vaccination, considering immediate term to be less than 4 weeks, short term to be less than 12 months, medium term from 12 months to 5 years, and long term for follow‐up longer than 5 years. If a study reported multiple time points within these categories, we prioritised the longest time point for meta‐analysis.

To account for confounding, if both adjusted and unadjusted estimates were reported within a study, we gave preference to the estimate that adjusted for the most important confounders for the review. Where data permitted, we combined adjusted point estimates using the generic inverse variance method (DerSimonian and Laird random‐effects). We also performed an analysis of adjusted effect estimates from those in the target population for vaccination, i.e. ≤ 16 years of age.

We checked all observational studies for potential overlapping populations, based on the location, study dates and source of the population and outcome data. Where we considered studies to be overlapping, these are grouped together in the list of included studies, and we only included one study in the meta‐analysis. This was the study with the lowest risk of bias, the largest sample size, or that covered the longest time period.

We used RR and its CI as measures of effect for cohort studies and population‐level studies. We used the OR and its CI for case‐control studies. For self‐controlled case series studies, we calculated a RI and its CI.

When meta‐analysis was not possible or appropriate, we used 'Synthesis without meta‐analysis' (SWiM) methodology (Campbell 2020).

Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity

We were unable to perform our planned subgroup analysis by time since vaccination programme introduction, as this was not clearly reported in most studies. We performed separate analyses for participants in the target population for vaccination, i.e. ≤ 16 years of age. We extracted effect estimates for partial schedule (i.e. one or two doses) and reported these along with full schedule effect estimates for each outcome.

### Use of 9-valent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine: updated HPV vaccination recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices [^91fc6e96]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2015). Medium credibility.

9-valent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine (9vHPV) — Phase III efficacy versus quadrivalent vaccine (4vHPV) in the per protocol population of females aged 16 through 26 years shows high efficacy against HPV 31, 33, 45, 52, 58 outcomes: for ≥ CIN2, VIN2/3, VaIN2/3 efficacy was 96.7 (95% CI 80.9–99.8) with 9vHPV cases 1 among 6,016 participants versus 30 among 6,017 with 4vHPV; for ≥ CIN2 efficacy was 96.3 (95% CI 79.5–99.8) with cases 1 among 5,948 versus 27 among 5,943; for 6‑month persistent infection efficacy was 96.0 (95% CI 94.4–97.2) with cases 35 among 5,939 versus 810 among 5,953; participants were from 18 countries with median follow‑up of 40 months.
