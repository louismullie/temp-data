## Question

Write a SOAP note for a follow-up visit on anticoagulation therapy.

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking me to write a SOAP note for a follow-up visit on anticoagulation therapy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and indication for anticoagulation. Then, I should verify the current anticoagulant, dose, and duration. Next, I will review INR control metrics and time in therapeutic range. After that, I need to check for bleeding, thrombotic events, and adverse effects. I will then examine adherence, drug–drug interactions, and lifestyle factors. Finally, I will reassess the indication and duration, adjust therapy as needed, and document the plan with monitoring and patient education, ensuring each step aligns with guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and indication, because everything downstream depends on it. I need to distinguish venous thromboembolism (provoked versus unprovoked, with or without cancer), atrial fibrillation with stroke risk, mechanical heart valves, and other indications, since duration and intensity vary accordingly, and I should verify this against FDA labeling and major guidelines to avoid anchoring on an incorrect premise [^112yVtAk] [^116doaNf].

> Next, I should review the current anticoagulant regimen, dose, and duration, and I need to ensure I capture any recent changes or transitions. For warfarin, I should confirm the target INR and whether bridging was used; for DOACs, I should confirm the agent, dose, and whether dose reduction is appropriate for renal function or other criteria, because underdosing or overdosing is common and consequential [^113xd6B9] [^1144RqaH].

> I will now examine INR control metrics, and I should double-check the time in therapeutic range and variance. Poor TTR correlates with more bleeding and less efficacy, and I should calculate TTR using Rosendaal or similar methods and flag high INR variability, as these predict adverse outcomes and guide intensified monitoring or switching strategies [^112k6c2H].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about stability. I should confirm whether the patient has had at least 3 months of consistent INR results without dose changes, because if so, extending INR monitoring intervals up to 12 weeks can be safe and noninferior to 4-week checks, though I need to ensure the patient remains engaged and that any dose changes reset the stability clock.

> I need to check for bleeding, thrombotic events, and adverse effects since the last visit, and I should quantify severity and timing. Major bleeding, clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding, and thrombotic recurrences alter risk–benefit and may necessitate switching agents, adjusting intensity, or temporarily interrupting therapy, so I must document each event and its management.

> Let me consider adherence and persistence, because nonadherence is a frequent cause of apparent "treatment failure". I should ask about missed doses, interruptions, and any difficulties with administration or cost, and I should verify refill data when available, since adherence issues should trigger education, adherence tools, or a change to a more manageable regimen rather than simply escalating intensity.

> I should confirm drug–drug interactions and new medications, including over-the-counter and herbal agents, because warfarin has numerous interactions and DOACs have clinically important inhibitors and inducers. If interactions are present, I need to increase monitoring frequency and adjust dosing prospectively rather than reactively, and I should document the plan to mitigate interaction risks [^117CMVg2].

> Next, I should review lifestyle and dietary factors that affect warfarin control, especially vitamin K intake consistency and alcohol use, and I should counsel on maintaining a stable diet and avoiding drastic changes. I also need to ask about falls, trauma, and activities that increase bleeding risk, and reinforce activity precautions and when to seek urgent care [^115mPpLa].

> I will now reassess the original indication and whether it remains valid, because indications can evolve. For VTE, I should confirm whether the event was provoked or unprovoked, whether cancer is present, and whether there has been recurrence, as these determine duration and agent selection; for AF, I should recalculate stroke risk and verify that the anticoagulant and dose remain appropriate given renal function and interactions [^113BLMww] [^116doaNf] [^117CMVg2].

> For duration decisions, I should align with guideline-based milestones: 3 months for provoked VTE, at least 3 to 6 months for a first unprovoked VTE with individualized consideration of extended therapy, and indefinite therapy for recurrent unprovoked VTE or active cancer. I should also discuss the trade-offs of extended therapy using data on recurrence risk and bleeding, and incorporate patient preferences [^113BLMww] [^116doaNf] [^113yUv3E].

> If INR is unstable or TTR is poor, I should consider switching to a DOAC when appropriate, or if already on a DOAC and unstable, I should verify adherence, interactions, and renal function and consider switching to LMWH or VKA with closer monitoring. For recurrent VTE on therapeutic anticoagulation, I should double-check the diagnosis, adherence, and occult malignancy, and then escalate intensity or switch class per guideline algorithms [^115UQRLD] [^112yR2c1].

> I should confirm the monitoring plan, including INR frequency for VKA users and lab surveillance for DOACs when indicated, and I need to ensure the patient knows when to obtain urgent labs or care. For stable VKA patients, extending to 12-week intervals is reasonable, but I should reset to 4 weeks after any dose change or instability, and for DOACs I should verify renal function periodically and adjust dosing accordingly [^1179VRtY] [^1144RqaH].

> Finally, I will document patient education and shared decision-making, including a written action plan for bleeding, missed doses, and when to contact clinicians. I should confirm the patient carries anticoagulation identification and understands peri-procedural management, and I will schedule follow-up to reassess risk–benefit, adherence, and any new clinical developments.

Deep venous thrombosis (DVT) is a frequently encountered condition that is often diagnosed and treated in the outpatient setting. Risk stratification is helpful and recommended in the evaluation of DVT. An evidence-based diagnostic approach is discussed here. Once diagnosed, the mainstay of DVT treatment is anticoagulation. The specific type and duration of anticoagulation depend upon the suspected etiology of the venous thromboembolism, as well as risks of bleeding and other patient comorbidities. Both specific details and a standardized approach to this vast treatment landscape are presented.

Results

Between July 2007 and October 2013, 104 patients were enrolled, 50 being randomized to warfarin and 54 to placebo. Of these patients, 102 (98.1%) attended the 18-month visit and 100 (96.2%) the 42-month visit; no patient was lost to follow up (Figure 1 and Online Supplementary Table S1). The median follow up (interquartile range) was 23.6 (23.2–24.1) months after the treatment period, and 41.2 (40.9–41.6) months overall. Baseline characteristics were similar between the two groups (Table 1).

Baseline characteristics of study participants according to randomized assignment.

Treatment and evaluation of International Normalized Ratios

The median study treatment duration was similar in the two groups (warfarin: 17.5 months; placebo: 17.2 months). Double-blind treatment was permanently discontinued in six warfarin-treated patients (none with recurrent venous thromboembolism or major bleeding, all 6 discontinuing for other reasons), and 21 placebo-treated patients (16 with confirmed recurrent venous thromboembolism, none experiencing major bleeding and 5 discontinuing for other reasons). Of the six patients on warfarin who discontinued the study treatment for reasons other than major bleeding, two continued to receive anticoagulant therapy; of the five patients on placebo who discontinued for other reasons, two started anticoagulant therapy. The median interval between INR measurements was 19.5 days and 20.5 days for warfarin- and placebo-treated patients, respectively. In the warfarin group, INR was within the therapeutic range (2.0–3.0] for 70.3% of the time, being below and above this range for 19.1% and 10.6% of the time, respectively; corresponding figures for the sham INR in the placebo group were 75.9%, 14.6% and 9.6%, respectively (Online Supplementary Table S2).

### Long-term management of venous thromboembolism: a 61-year-old woman with unprovoked venous thromboembolism [^113yUv3E]. JAMA (2011). Excellent credibility.

Numerous randomized clinical trials have compared various durations of anticoagulant therapy with a vitamin K antagonist (ie, warfarin) for an initial episode of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Despite major advances in understanding the pathophysiology of thrombosis and its genetic basis, clinical risk factors at presentation have emerged as the primary determinant of recurrence risk. Following a minimum of 3 months of anticoagulant therapy, patients with VTE in association with transient risk factors (eg, major surgery, trauma, pregnancy) have a low annual recurrence risk, while patients without identifiable provocative risk factors have a recurrence risk of approximately 25% at 4 years with the highest annual rates occurring in the first 2 years. Extending warfarin therapy is highly effective in preventing recurrences but is associated with increased rates of major and minor bleeding. Clinical decision making therefore requires individualized assessment of recurrence and bleeding risk, coupled with patient preference. After 3 months of anticoagulant therapy for a first episode of unprovoked VTE, male sex, age older than 65 years, and an elevated D-dimer level 1 month after discontinuing anticoagulant therapy are useful parameters in identifying patients with an increased recurrence risk. The case of Ms W, a woman with unprovoked venous thromboembolism and hemorrhagic event while receiving anticoagulation, is used to illustrate clinical decision making to determine ongoing treatment.

### A 52-year-old-male patient with metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer and recurrent venous thromboembolism in unusual sites despite anticoagulation [^113fj2Ah]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

The link between cancer and venous thromboembolism is well known, with an annual incidence rate of venous thromboembolism between 0.5% and 20% depending on the primary site and background risk factors. Current guidelines suggest treatment with low-molecular-weight heparin over oral vitamin K antagonists. However, data regarding the management of recurrent venous thromboembolism when the patient is under treatment with anticoagulants are sparse. In this article we present a patient with multiple thromboembolic events in unusual sites despite anticoagulant treatment and we discuss the management options.

### Fondaparinux as alternative anticoagulant to warfarin or low-molecular-weight heparin for recurrent venous thrombosis [^114f8dVB]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

Recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE) occurs in some patients despite treatment with the standard drugs, warfarin and low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH). Fondaparinux is currently licensed by the Food and Drug Administration for the prophylaxis of deep-vein thrombosis in patients undergoing orthopedic or abdominal surgery and also in the treatment of VTE. Well-documented use of this agent beyond these indications and for prolonged periods is currently limited.

Case Summary

Two cases of "refractory" VTE, managed effectively with long-term fondaparinux are described. In the first case, a 43-year-old man developed recurrent thrombosis while receiving warfarin at a higher target international normalized ratio (INR) of 3 to 4. In the second case, a 45-year-old man developed recurrent thrombosis on once-daily dalteparin. Both the patients were successfully managed with fondaparinux for 36 months and 14 months, respectively, with no sign of recurrent thrombosis or adverse effects.

Discussion

In patients with recurrent VTE, fondaparinux is effective as daily injections as much as twice-daily LMWH or warfarin maintained on higher therapeutic-range INRs. Although the exact mechanism for this effectiveness is not yet understood, it provides a useful alternative to the standard therapies. In addition, the side effect profile is also favorable for fondaparinux, in that it causes less thrombocytopenia and skin reactions in comparison with heparins.

Conclusion

Daily fondaparinux injections may be an effective antithrombotic agent in patients who develop recurrent VTE on anticoagulation with warfarin or LMWH.

### A potential interaction between warfarin and atovaquone [^1121CSRL]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To report a case of increased international normalized ratio (INR) in a patient established on warfarin therapy who was then initiated on atovaquone therapy.

Case Summary

A 53-year-old African American male with HIV was prescribed warfarin 5 mg/day for 12 months after diagnosis of idiopathic deep vein thrombosis and bilateral pulmonary emboli (target INR 2.5 [range 2.0–3.0]). The patient required Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia prophylaxis and was prescribed atovaquone instead of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole therapy because of the latter drug's known interaction with warfarin. The patient's INR rose by greater than 50% (from 2.3 to 3.5) after 7 days of concomitant warfarin and atovaquone. In response, the patient's total weekly warfarin dose was decreased by 5%. Eight days later, the patient's INR was still supratherapeutic at 3.1. Approximately 4 weeks later, his INR was 4.2. One dose of warfarin was withheld and then the total weekly warfarin dosage was decreased by another 10%. Eight days later, the patient discontinued atovaquone therapy but continued on warfarin as prescribed. One day after atovaquone discontinuation, his INR decreased to 1.7. Due to this subtherapeutic INR level, 8 days later the total weekly warfarin dose was increased by 5%. Although a follow-up appointment was scheduled, no further INR values were obtained because the patient's 12-month course of anticoagulation therapy was completed and warfarin was discontinued. The patient did not report any adverse effects or signs or symptoms of hemorrhage while his INR values were supratherapeutic.

Discussion

Warfarin's potential for interactions with other highly protein-bound drugs, such as atovaquone, can result in displacement from protein binding sites and increased serum concentrations of warfarin. Based on a search of MEDLINE/PubMed, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, and the Food and Drug Administration MedWatch Adverse Event Reporting Program (all through July 31, 2010), no cases were found of an interaction between atovaquone and warfarin. The Horn Drug Interaction Probability Scale calculated this to be a probable interaction between warfarin and atovaquone.

Conclusions

Although current medication references do not report an interaction between atovaquone and warfarin, knowledge of their pharmacodynamic properties can enable practitioners to anticipate the consequences of a possible transient increase in warfarin serum concentration, such as that seen in our patient, when given concomitantly.

Vitamin K antagonist (VKA) loading dose case series — Two large case series involving a total of 1,054 outpatients suggest that a nomogram specifying a 10-mg loading dose is safe, with a recurrent VTE rate of 1.9% and a major bleeding rate of 1.0% at 3 months follow-up. However, pooling across both studies suggests that only 49.3% of participants followed the nomogram completely.

Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) with prior arterial or venous thromboembolism — vitamin K antagonist (VKA) intensity is guided as follows: For patients with antiphospholipid syndrome with previous arterial or venous thromboembolism, we suggest VKA therapy titrated to a moderate-intensity international normalized ratio (INR) range (INR 2.0–3.0) rather than higher intensity (INR 3.0–4.5) (Grade 2B). Supporting comparative data for high- vs moderate-intensity VKA include 220 participants (2 studies) with 3 y follow-up reporting thromboembolism OR 2.33 (0.82–6.66), major bleeding OR 0.70 (0.23–2.16), and mortality OR 1.51 (0.3–7.72).

Bleeding risk and management context with elevated international normalized ratio (INR) on warfarin: "The risk of bleeding increases significantly when the INR exceeds 4.5". In patients with mechanical heart valves, adverse events increased from "two per 100 patient-years at INR 2.5 to 4.9, to 4.8 per 100 patient-years for INR 5 to 5.5, then to 7.5 per 100 patient-years for INR ≥ 6.5", and intracerebral bleeding doubled "for every 0.5-s increment in prothrombin time". When supratherapeutic INR occurs without bleeding, strategies include withholding VKA, adjusting VKA dose, or giving vitamin K, and a 2006 meta-analysis found vitamin K "was more likely to reverse overanticoagulation (INR > 4) at 24 h compared with simply withholding VKA".

Vitamin K antagonist (VKA) maintenance — international normalized ratio (INR) monitoring frequency for consistently stable results: Stable INRs are defined as "at least 3 months of consistent results with no need to adjust VKA dosing". Practice varies, with "stable patients usually" tested "every 4 weeks" in North America, whereas "INR recall intervals of up to 90 days are routine" in the United Kingdom. Evidence includes three RCTs of recall intervals exceeding the 4-week standard; one compared 6- to 4-week intervals, another allowed intervals "of up to 12 weeks", and a third compared "4- to 12-week" intervals, with "none of the studies" showing differences in thromboembolism, bleeding, or INR control. Accordingly, the recommendation states: "For patients taking VKA therapy with consistently stable INRs, we suggest an INR testing frequency of up to 12 weeks rather than every 4 weeks (Grade 2B)".

Warfarin interaction mitigation — The most effective method to avoid adverse outcomes associated with drug interactions is to try to avoid, when feasible, concurrent use of potentially interacting drugs and to use noninteracting alternatives instead; when noninteracting alternatives are not available, adverse outcomes can be avoided by increasing the frequency of monitoring and adjusting warfarin doses based on INR response, and prospective dosing adjustments are inappropriate because of the unpredictable nature of patient response to drug interactions.

Warfarin loading strategies in randomized trials — two studies compared a 10-mg loading dose to 5 mg daily for the first 2 days, with one not reporting recurrent VTE; concentrations of protein C and factor VII decreased faster in the 10-mg group than in the 5-mg group, but increased recurrent thromboembolism has not been demonstrated. In a trial of 5 vs 10 mg initial dosing in 190 patients there was no difference in median time to two consecutive therapeutic international normalized ratios (INRs), with a 2-week follow-up and exclusion of 322 of 372 screened. Another study showed a shorter time to a therapeutic INR with loading dose vs standard initiation (3.3 vs 4.3 days). A 10- vs 5-mg initiation nomogram in 210 outpatients yielded a shorter mean time to therapeutic INR of 4.2 vs 5.6 days and a higher proportion therapeutic by day 5 of 86% vs 45%, and all studies followed the initiation period with INR-based dose adjustment.

Warfarin initiation dosing and timing — following the administration of VKAs, an initial effect on the INR usually occurs within the first 2 or 3 days and an antithrombotic effect occurs within the next several days. Initiation doses between 5 and 10 mg are effective, with individual responses varying according to the inpatient or outpatient status, age, concomitant treatments, and comorbidities; starting doses of ≤ 5 mg might be appropriate in the elderly, in patients with impaired nutrition, liver disease, or congestive heart failure, and in patients who are at high risk of bleeding. A dose of 2 to 3 mg seems to be appropriate for patients who have undergone heart valve replacement.

### Potential inaccuracy of point-of-care INR in dabigatran-treated patients [^113VV4vX]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To report 2 cases in which point-of-care international normalized ratios (INRs) in dabigatran-treated patients were inaccurate.

Case Summary

A 59-year-old woman with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation was started on warfarin. After 3 days, warfarin was discontinued, and the decision was made to switch to dabigatran 150 mg twice a day, which was started 2 days after the warfarin was discontinued. As treatment was being converted from warfarin to dabigatran therapy, the woman's primary care physician referred her to our anticoagulation clinic, where her point-of-care INR was 7.2. A laboratory INR performed approximately 30 minutes later was 1.7. Several repeat point-of-care INRs were elevated and discordant with the laboratory INRs. A second patient, a 52-year-old man, was started on dabigatran after an ablation procedure, as a bridge to warfarin. Approximately 16 hours after a single dose of dabigatran etexilate 150 mg, the point-of-care INR was 1.6.

Discussion

Dabigatran etexilate is an oral direct thrombin inhibitor that is approved for use in thromboprophylaxis of atrial fibrillation and deep vein thrombosis. Dabigatran's predictable pharmacokinetic profile allows for a fixed-dose regimen without the need for coagulation monitoring. In certain clinical situations (eg, switching treatment between dabigatran and warfarin), INR testing is performed as part of routine clinical care. During the development program for dabigatran, laboratory testing of INR was performed, with INRs at therapeutic concentrations of dabigatran ranging from 1.1 to 1.7. Supratherapeutic concentrations of dabigatran elevated the INR to slightly higher levels, between 1.7 and 2.4. Even at extremely high dabigatran concentrations, the INR was generally in the range of 2.3–3.5.

Conclusions

We advocate laboratory INR testing with simultaneous assessment of the activated partial thromboplastin time in patients who are receiving or who have recently received dabigatran. A prospective evaluation assessing the accuracy of the commonly used point-of-care INR devices in patients receiving dabigatran would confirm our findings with respect to this device and determine whether our findings extend to other commonly used devices.

In a multicenter, parallel group study, 900 patients with acute lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) with or without pulmonary embolism (PE) were randomized to an inpatient (hospital) treatment of either (i) enoxaparin sodium 1.5 mg/kg once a day subcutaneously, (ii) enoxaparin sodium 1 mg/kg every 12 hours subcutaneously, or (iii) heparin intravenous bolus (5000 IU) followed by a continuous infusion (administered to achieve an aPTT of 55 to 85 seconds). A total of 900 patients were randomized in the study and all patients were treated. Patients ranged in age from 18 to 92 years (mean age 60.7 years) with 54.7% men and 45.3% women. All patients also received warfarin sodium (dose adjusted according to PT to achieve an International Normalization Ratio [INR] of 2.0 to 3.0), commencing within 72 hours of initiation of enoxaparin sodium or standard heparin therapy, and continuing for 90 days. Enoxaparin sodium or standard heparin therapy was administered for a minimum of 5 days and until the targeted warfarin sodium INR was achieved. Both enoxaparin sodium regimens were equivalent to standard heparin therapy in reducing the risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism (DVT and/or PE).

### Long-term, low-intensity warfarin therapy for the prevention of recurrent venous thromboembolism [^111KZdBU]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2003). Excellent credibility.

Background

Standard therapy to prevent recurrent venous thromboembolism includes 3 to 12 months of treatment with full-dose warfarin with a target international normalized ratio (INR) between 2.0 and 3.0. However, for long-term management, no therapeutic agent has shown an acceptable benefit-to-risk ratio.

Methods

Patients with idiopathic venous thromboembolism who had received full-dose anticoagulation therapy for a median of 6.5 months were randomly assigned to placebo or low-intensity warfarin (target INR, 1.5 to 2.0). Participants were followed for recurrent venous thromboembolism, major hemorrhage, and death.

Results

The trial was terminated early after 508 patients had undergone randomization and had been followed for up to 4.3 years (mean, 2.1). Of 253 patients assigned to placebo, 37 had recurrent venous thromboembolism (7.2 per 100 person-years), as compared with 14 of 255 patients assigned to low-intensity warfarin (2.6 per 100 person-years), a risk reduction of 64 percent (hazard ratio, 0.36 [95 percent confidence interval, 0.19 to 0.67]; P < 0.001). Risk reductions were similar for all subgroups, including those with and those without inherited thrombophilia. Major hemorrhage occurred in two patients assigned to placebo and five assigned to low-intensity warfarin (P = 0.25). Eight patients in the placebo group and four in the group assigned to low-intensity warfarin died (P = 0.26). Low-intensity warfarin was thus associated with a 48 percent reduction in the composite end point of recurrent venous thromboembolism, major hemorrhage, or death. According to per-protocol and as-treated analyses, the reduction in the risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism was between 76 and 81 percent.

Conclusions

Long-term, low-intensity warfarin therapy is a highly effective method of preventing recurrent venous thromboembolism.

If yes, ask "Is an urgent surgical/ invasive procedure planned?"; for yes, "Suggest delaying restart of anticoagulation until procedure performed". If no, evaluate "Did bleeding occur at a critical site (see Table 1)?" and "Has sufficient time passed to consider restarting anticoagulation?"; if no to the latter, "• Ensure plan for follow-up on a specific date to address restarting anticoagulation
- Consider nonpharmacologic therapies". If time has passed, assess "Is the patient at high risk of rebleeding?"; if no, "Suggest restarting anticoagulation (see Figure 5)". If yes, determine "Is the patient at low/moderate thrombotic risk?"; for yes, actions include "• Consider patient values/preferences
- If indicated, start temporary anticoagulation for VTE prophylaxis
- Delay anticoagulation for a short duration and reassess". If no (high thrombotic risk), the box "Patient is at high thrombotic risk:" advises "• Consider patient values/preferences
- If indicated, start temporary parenteral anticoagulation with IV heparin or pharmacological VTE prophylaxis until bleeding risk decreases
- If the patient is a candidate, consider nonpharmacological therapies".

### Antithrombotic therapy for VTE disease: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^112yR2c1]. Chest (2016). Medium credibility.

Recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE) on anticoagulant therapy — management principles: The guideline notes "There are no randomized trials or prospective cohort studies that have evaluated management of patients with recurrent VTE on anticoagulant therapy", so management "is based on low-quality evidence" and the likely cause, grouped into "(1) treatment factors and (2) the patient's intrinsic risk of recurrence". The risk "decreases rapidly after starting anticoagulant therapy, with a much higher risk during the first week (or month) compared with the second week (or month)", and an early recurrence "can generally be managed by a time-limited (eg, 1 month) period of more aggressive anticoagulant intensity (eg, switching from an oral agent back to LMWH, an increase in LMWH dose)". Treatment-factor checks include "(1) was LMWH being used; (2) was the patient adherent; (3) was VKA subtherapeutic; (4) was anticoagulant therapy prescribed correctly; (5) was the patient taking an NOAC and a drug that reduced anticoagulant effect; and (6) had anticoagulant dose been reduced (drugs other than VKA)?" For cancer-associated VTE and for unexplained recurrence on VKA or a NOAC, the panel states "There is moderate-quality evidence that LMWH is more effective than VKA therapy in patients with VTE and cancer", and provides dose-adjustment approaches: if LMWH was previously reduced "(eg, by 25% after 1 month of treatment), it is usually increased to the previous level", if on full-dose LMWH "the dose may be increased by about 25%", and "Once-daily LMWH may also be switched to a twice-daily regimen".

### A probable interaction between warfarin and the antiretroviral TRIO study regimen [^116rHHrC]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To report a probable drug interaction between the antiretroviral TRIO regimen (ritonavir-boosted darunavir, etravirine, and raltegravir) and warfarin in an HIV-infected patient.

Case Summary

In January 2010, a 50-year-old transgender female with HIV infection and recurrent deep vein thrombosis began treatment with the TRIO study regimen. Treatment had been maintained with warfarin for the past 5 years and emtricitabine monotherapy for the preceding 22 months. Emtricitabine was discontinued when the TRIO regimen was started. The mean weekly warfarin dose while the patient was receiving emtricitabine monotherapy was 13.3 mg (95% CI 12.7 to 13.8), with a mean international normalized ratio (INR) of 2.8 (95% CI 2.5 to 3.1). Following the initiation of the TRIO regimen, the mean weekly warfarin dose was increased to 19.3 mg (95% CI 18.5 to 20.1) and was maintained over the ensuing 71 weeks with a mean INR of 2.6 (95% CI 2.2 to 3.0).

Discussion

Information on the effect of newer antiretrovirals on warfarin metabolism, as well as the collective contribution of combination antiretroviral therapy including multiple agents that may alter warfarin metabolism, is limited. We predicted that warfarin dose requirements would change upon initiation of the TRIO regimen. Given the variability in INR that can occur with chronic warfarin treatment, weekly warfarin doses were averaged during emtricitabine monotherapy (90 weeks) and TRIO regimen (71 weeks) periods. Mean weekly warfarin doses increased by 45% (p < 0.001) following initiation of the TRIO regimen. Mean INR results for the 2 time periods were not significantly different, demonstrating that stable anticoagulation was maintained. The Horn drug interaction probability scale score to assess causation indicated a probable interaction.

Conclusions

An increased weekly warfarin dose requirement is predicted when warfarin is used concurrently with the antiretroviral TRIO regimen. Increased INR monitoring is prudent when the combination is administered.

### Three months versus one year of oral anticoagulant therapy for idiopathic deep venous thrombosis. warfarin optimal duration Italian trial investigators [^116LJMSt]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2001). Excellent credibility.

Background

In patients with idiopathic deep venous thrombosis, continuing anticoagulant therapy beyond three months is associated with a reduced incidence of recurrent thrombosis during the period of therapy. Whether this benefit persists after anticoagulant therapy is discontinued is controversial.

Methods

Patients with a first episode of idiopathic proximal deep venous thrombosis who had completed three months of oral anticoagulant therapy (with warfarin, in 97 percent of the cases and acenocoumarol in 3 percent) were randomly assigned to the discontinuation of oral anticoagulants or to their continuation for nine additional months. The primary study outcome was recurrence of symptomatic, objectively confirmed venous thromboembolism during at least two years of follow-up.

Results

The primary intention-to-treat analysis showed that of 134 patients assigned to continued oral anticoagulant therapy, 21 had a recurrence of venous thromboembolism (15.7 percent; average follow-up, 37.8 months), as compared with 21 of 133 patients assigned to the discontinuation of oral anticoagulant therapy (15.8 percent; average follow-up, 37.2 months), resulting in a relative risk of 0.99 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.57 to 1.73). During the initial nine months after randomization (after all patients received three months of therapy), 1 patient had a recurrence while receiving oral anticoagulant therapy (0.7 percent), as compared with 11 of the patients assigned to the discontinuation of oral anticoagulant therapy (8.3 percent; P = 0.003). The incidence of recurrence after the discontinuation of treatment was 5.1 percent per patient-year in patients in whom oral anticoagulant therapy was discontinued after 3 months (95 percent confidence interval, 3.2 to 7.5 percent; average interval since discontinuation, 37.2 months) and 5.0 percent per patient-year in patients who received an additional 9 months of oral anticoagulant therapy (95 percent confidence interval, 3.1 to 7.8 percent; average interval since discontinuation, 29.4 months). None of the recurrences were fatal. Four patients had non-fatal major bleeding during the extended period of anticoagulant therapy (3.0 percent).

Conclusions

In patients with idiopathic deep venous thrombosis, the clinical benefit associated with extending the duration of anticoagulant therapy to one year is not maintained after the therapy is discontinued.

### Recurrent chronic thromboembolic disease despite optimal anticoagulation in setting of recent COVID-19 infection [^114tnP4U]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Treatment

In the hospital, the patient was treated with intranasal oxygen, supportive care, and was transiently on unfractionated intravenous heparin therapy while the consideration of anticoagulation failure was being discussed. Due to the patient's morbid obesity and the lack of data on the efficacy and safety of Direct Oral Anticoagulants (DOACs) in obese patients, a DOAC was not considered as a therapeutic option. Additionally, the patient was not thought to be a candidate for subcutaneous enoxaparin therapy due to his high dose requirement calculation based on his obesity. Following extensive discussions between the care teams and the patient, a decision was ultimately made to continue on warfarin with a slightly higher INR target range. In addition to this, the patient was advised to follow closely with the haematology department for future consideration of enoxaparin therapy with monitoring of Factor Xa levels, after adequate weight loss.

### AGA clinical practice update: coagulation in cirrhosis [^115Bo1G4]. Gastroenterology (2019). High credibility.

AGA Clinical Practice Update — Anticoagulant therapy in cirrhosis addresses portal vein thrombosis (PVT) by noting that in the acute setting such as new (especially if symptomatic) PVT or extension of prior thrombosis, management notes systemic anticoagulation with IV heparin or low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), while asymptomatic incidentally discovered PVT does not invariably warrant therapy and spontaneous resolution may occur, especially if partial. For chronic PVT, especially in patients listed for transplantation or with a history of symptomatic PVT or mesenteric thrombosis, direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are reported as safe and effective in Child–Pugh class A and early class B, whereas vitamin K antagonists (eg, warfarin) are problematic due to uncertainty of target INR. For prevention, deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis in hospitalized patients with cirrhosis is indicated, and in the absence of bleeding, routine DVT prophylaxis measures are recommended.

### Apixaban compared with warfarin to prevent thrombosis in thrombotic antiphospholipid syndrome: a randomized trial [^11222EZn]. Blood Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

Statistical a nalysis

Based upon former work, we estimated a recurrent rate of thrombosis of 1.5% among patients receiving anticoagulation, and using a noninferiority design, we estimated that 4640 subjects would need to be enrolled to have 80% power to report a 1% difference in thrombosis rate. Given the large number of patients (with a rare condition) needed, we aimed to conduct a pilot study first by randomizing 200 patients to apixaban or warfarin to report primary outcome rates that could evaluate feasibility and inform future research. We hypothesized that apixaban would not differ from warfarin for the outcome of thrombosis and vascular death or major bleeding and CRNMB among patients with TAPS receiving therapeutic anticoagulation for secondary prevention of thrombosis. Descriptive demographics of the patient population were calculated for each arm as either mean and standard deviation or number of participants and percentage. Intention-to-treat analysis was used to report the primary efficacy outcome (thrombosis and vascular mortality) and primary safety outcome (major bleeding and CRNMB). Cox proportional-hazards models were used to assess differences in outcomes between the study arms. Person-time and Kaplan-Meier curves were calculated for each outcome separately and for the net clinical benefit upon combining the primary efficacy and safety outcomes. In a sensitivity analysis, the as-treated status of participants was considered for exposure to apixaban 2.5 mg twice daily dosing, apixaban 5.0 mg twice daily dosing, and warfarin. An additional sensitivity analysis was done to omit patients with a history of arterial thromboembolism. Quality of anticoagulation management was assessed by calculating the time in therapeutic range in a usual fashion. INR values used in the calculation were collected as part of the study protocol, as well as all laboratory values gathered from routine clinical care. Adherence to apixaban was calculated from the visit questionnaires that interrogated for elective interruption and missed doses and were reported as a percent of doses prescribed.

To analyze findings from the ACTS survey, benefit and burden questions were aggregated separately and then combined for a final score. Higher scores correlated with greater satisfaction. A Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare between study arms. All analyses were conducted with R version 4.0.3.

Role of the funding source

Bristol-Myers-Squibb/Pfizer Pharmaceuticals provided apixaban and funding for the study but had no role in the design or conduct of the study. Data collection, data management, analysis, data interpretation, and manuscript preparation were conducted independent of the funding source.

### Oral anticoagulant therapy: antithrombotic therapy and prevention of thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^115mPpLa]. Chest (2012). Medium credibility.

Long-term INR stability during vitamin K antagonist (VKA) therapy — patient factors, monitoring implications, physical activity, and vitamin K intake: Two recent studies assessed very stable INR control, comparing 2,504 patients with all INR values in range for 6 months vs 3,569 with at least one value outside range, and 533 patients in range for 12 months vs 2,555 controls. Independent predictors of stability were age > 70 years and absence of chronic diseases (male gender in one study), while congestive heart failure, diabetes, and a target range for INR ≥ 3.0 were associated with instability. Patients with very stable INR levels required fewer visits and had fewer events; investigators suggested many such warfarin-treated patients could be safely managed with INR recall intervals ≥ 4 weeks, and advanced age predicted stable anticoagulation. Physical activity influences control, with reductions in anticoagulant effect correlated with sudden increases in activity and increased warfarin requirements described with daily exercise such as walking. Dietary vitamin K affects stability: controlling intake can achieve a more stable response; unstable patients had poorer intake than stable controls; vitamin K‑depleted patients show greater INR influence from small vitamin K amounts; in healthy volunteers, a daily dose of at least 150 μg was needed to alter the INR response; and in nine unstable patients, 100 μg daily increased INRs in range from 32% to 57%.

Medication reconciliation and antithrombotic management — Medication reconciliation is necessary before discharge and must be clearly documented on the discharge instructions; the expected duration of DAPT should be documented as part of medication reconciliation, with particular attention to patients requiring "triple therapy" (antiplatelets/anticoagulants), and duration of each medication explicitly stated. Due to increased bleeding risk, triple therapy should be maintained for the least amount of time possible. Patients previously on a TSOAC can restart the next day, and patients previously on warfarin should restart their standard regimen immediately and arrange for follow-up PT/INR within 1 week of discharge. LMWH as a bridge to therapeutic warfarin is not routinely recommended (due to the potential for bleeding) except in cases of mechanical prosthetic valves, recent deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, and other causes for extreme risk of thrombosis. Metformin should be held for 48 hr. Proton-pump inhibitors should be prescribed for patients with prior history of gastrointestinal bleeding who are discharged on DAPT, and should be considered for all patients on triple therapy.

Case Description

We present the case of a 49-year-old male patient with a history of bilateral deep vein thrombosis on warfarin therapy who presented with dry cough and dyspnea at rest that worsened 2 days before admission. The patient was hemodynamically stable on admission, with moderate hypoxemia (oxygen saturation 87% with fraction of inspired oxygen 50%). Computed tomography showed massive bilateral pulmonary embolism, as well as thrombosis of the left subclavian artery. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) revealed a highly mobile elongated mass in the right atrium that crossed the patent foramen ovale (PFO) into the left atrium, with concomitant pulmonary hypertension (Figure 1). Anticoagulation with intravenous heparin was started as soon as the diagnosis was made.

Urgent surgical management was indicated, and bilateral pulmonary and atrial thromboembolectomy were performed, plus PFO closure with autologous pericardium (Figure 2). Total cardiopulmonary bypass time was 3 hours and 16 minutes; aortic crossclamp time was 2 hours and 21 minutes with 20 minutes of hypothermic circulatory arrest. Intraoperative TEE showed improvement in pulmonary hypertension, preserved biventricular function with mild tricuspid regurgitation, and satisfactory closure of the foramen ovale. In the intensive care unit, the patient presented with moderate hypoxemia due to reperfusion edema that was managed according to protocol. Anticoagulation was started 24 hours after surgery, with intravenous heparin, transitioning to warfarin for a target international normalized ratio of 2.5 to 3.5 (Video 1).

### 2020 ACC expert consensus decision pathway on management of bleeding in patients on oral anticoagulants: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^111cBg6Z]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2020). High credibility.

Restarting oral anticoagulation (OAC) after bleeding — indications and risk–benefit factors: In most cases, restarting OAC after a bleeding event provides net clinical benefit, and after a patient has a bleeding event on OAC, the indication for OAC should be reassessed to determine whether continued therapy is warranted on the basis of established clinical practice guidelines. Possible conditions for which OAC may no longer be indicated include nonvalvular AF with CHA2DS2-VASc score < 2 in men and < 3 in women, first time provoked VTE > 3 months ago, or bioprosthetic valve placement in the absence of AF > 3 months ago. If there is an ongoing indication for OAC, the clinician must evaluate the net clinical benefit of OAC in the context of a recent bleed, and this assessment should be conducted in consultation with other practitioners and in discussion with patients or caregivers; several validated bleeding assessment tools are available, but none has been studied in the specific situation of active or very recent bleeding. Reversible factors that may have contributed to the bleed, such as a high INR in a patient on a VKA, concomitant antiplatelet therapy, acute or worsening renal insufficiency leading to elevated OAC levels, or significant drug interactions that could increase DOAC levels, should be addressed prior to restarting therapy. If the patient is on dual antiplatelet therapy, re-evaluating whether aspirin can be discontinued is reasonable, and bleed characteristics that contribute substantially to risks with restarting anticoagulation include the location, the source and whether it was definitively identified and treated, the mechanism, and whether further surgical or procedural interventions are planned; patients who are at a high thrombotic risk will likely benefit from restarting anticoagulation even if the risk of rebleeding is high.

### Antithrombotic therapy practices in US hospitals in an era of practice guidelines… [^111i5aYc]. JAMA Network (2005). Excellent credibility.

Patients who underwent TKR and THR received a mean ± SD of 3. 2 ±
2. 4 and 3. 4 ±
3. 0 days of postprocedure anticoagulation therapy, respectively. Only 261 patients who underwent TKR and 206 patients who underwent THR received a prescription for postdischarge anticoagulant agents. Patients receiving aspirin within 24 hours of hospitalization, or within 8 hours of arrival at the hospital or of AMI diagnosis, accounted for 75. 5% of the total. Excluding 120 patients with active peptic ulcer disease or a bleeding history, 643 received aspirin within 8 hours or had documentation of receipt in the previous 24 hours.

we did not have posthospitalization data to determine the mean duration of anticoagulation after hospital discharge, we do know that the mean inpatient duration of prophylaxis was less than 5 days and that only slightly greater than 70% of patients who underwent TKR or THR and 50% of those who underwent hip fracture repair were discharged with anticoagulation therapy. These findings indicate that the duration of therapy is inadequate for many patients. Aspirin is generally the preferred agent for the secondary prevention of vascular events and death after AMI because of its ease of use, low cost, and proven efficacy. Supporting data31-33 indicate that early administration of aspirin improves survival and reperfusion rates over later administration. Therefore, we measured the frequency of aspirin administration within 8 hours of arrival at the hospital or within 8 hours of an event when hospitalized, except in patients who took a routine dose of aspirin within 24 hours of the event.

Guidelines recommend that unfractionated heparin or low-molecular-weight heparin administration be continued for a minimum of 4 to 5 days and until the INR has been at least 2. 0 for a minimum of 2 consecutive days. 34 Our data suggest that only half of all patients who initiated warfarin therapy reached an INR of 2. 0 or greater for 2 consecutive days before the parenteral agent was discontinued. Only a few patients without a therapeutic INR for 2 consecutive days had 4 days of concurrent unfractionated heparin or low-molecular-weight heparin and warfarin therapy. Concurrent therapy must be long enough to ensure adequate anticoagulation.

### Association between warfarin control metrics and atrial fibrillation outcomes in the outcomes registry for better informed treatment of atrial fibrillation [^112k6c2H]. JAMA Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

Importance

Bleeding and thrombotic events (eg, stroke and systemic embolism) are common in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) taking warfarin sodium despite a well-established therapeutic range.

Objective

To evaluate whether history of therapeutic warfarin control in patients with AF is independently associated with subsequent bleeding or thrombotic events.

Design, Setting, and Participants

In this multicenter cohort study of 176 primary care, cardiology, and electrophysiology clinics in the United States, data were obtained during 51 830 visits among 10 137 patients with AF in the Outcomes Registry for Better Informed Treatment of Atrial Fibrillation (ORBIT-AF) Registry; 5545 patients treated with warfarin were included in the bleeding analysis, and 5635 patients were included in the thrombotic event analysis. Patient follow-up was performed from June 29, 2010, to November 30, 2014. Data analysis was performed from August 4, 2016, to February 15, 2019.

Exposures

Multiple measures of warfarin control within the preceding 6 months were analyzed: time in therapeutic range of 2.0 to 3.0, most recent international normalized ratio (INR), percentage of time that a patient had interpolated INR values less than 2.0 or greater than 3.0, INR variance, INR range, and percentage of INR values in therapeutic range.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Association of INR measures, alone or in combination, with clinical factors and risk for thrombotic events and bleeding during the subsequent 6 months was assessed post hoc using logistic regression models.

Results

A total of 5545 patients (mean [SD] age, 74.5 [9.8] years; 3184 [57.4%] male) with AF were included in the major bleeding analysis and 5635 patients (mean [SD] age, 74.5 [9.8] years; 3236 [57.4%] male) in the thrombotic event analysis. During a median follow-up of 1.5 years (interquartile range, 1.0–2.5 years), there were 339 major bleeds (6.1%) and 51 strokes (0.9%). Multiple metrics of warfarin control were individually associated with subsequent bleeding. After adjustment for clinical bleeding risk, 3 measures-time in therapeutic range (per 1-SD increase ≤ 55: adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.16; 95% CI, 1.02–1.32), variation in INR values (aOR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.19–1.47), and maximum INR (aOR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.10–1.31)-remained associated with bleeding risk. Adding INR variance to a clinical risk model slightly increased the C statistic from 0.68 to 0.69 and had a net reclassification improvement index of 0.028 (95% CI, -0.029 to 0.067). No INR measures were associated with subsequent stroke risk.

Conclusions and Relevance

Three metrics of prior warfarin control were associated with bleeding risk but only marginally more so than traditional clinical factors. This study did not identify any measures of INR control that were significantly associated with stroke risk.

### A randomized clinical trial of high-intensity warfarin vs. conventional antithrombotic therapy for the prevention of recurrent thrombosis in patients with the antiphospholipid syndrome (WAPS) [^11343Dkw]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2005). Low credibility.

Background

The optimal intensity of oral anticoagulation for the prevention of recurrent thrombosis in patients with antiphospholipid antibody syndrome is uncertain. Retrospective studies show that only high-intensity oral anticoagulation [target international normalized ratio (INR) > 3.0] is effective but a recent randomized clinical trial comparing high (INR range 3.0–4.0) vs. moderate (INR 2.0–3.0) intensities of anticoagulation failed to confirm this assumption.

Methods

We conducted a randomized trial in which 109 patients with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) and previous thrombosis were given either high-intensity warfarin (INR range 3.0–4.5, 54 patients) or standard antithrombotic therapy (warfarin, INR range 2.0–3.0 in 52 patients or aspirin alone, 100 mg day(-1) in three patients) to determine whether intensive anticoagulation is superior to standard treatment in preventing symptomatic thromboembolism without increasing the bleeding risk.

Results

The 109 patients enrolled in the trial were followed up for a median time of 3.6 years. Mean INR during follow-up was 3.2 (SD 0.6) in the high-intensity warfarin group and 2.5 (SD 0.3) (P < 0.0001) in the conventional treatment patients given warfarin. Recurrent thrombosis was observed in six of 54 patients (11.1%) assigned to receive high-intensity warfarin and in three of 55 patients (5.5%) assigned to receive conventional treatment [hazard ratio for the high intensity group, 1.97; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.49–7.89]. Major and minor bleeding occurred in 15 patients (two major) (27.8%) assigned to receive high-intensity warfarin and eight (three major) (14.6%) assigned to receive conventional treatment (hazard ratio 2.18; 95% CI 0.92–5.15).

Conclusions

High-intensity warfarin was not superior to standard treatment in preventing recurrent thrombosis in patients with APS and was associated with an increased rate of minor hemorrhagic complications.

14.4 Treatment of Deep Vein Thrombosis with or without Pulmonary Embolism

In a multicenter, parallel group study, 900 patients with acute lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) with or without pulmonary embolism (PE) were randomized to an inpatient (hospital) treatment of either (i) enoxaparin sodium injection 1.5 mg/kg once a day subcutaneously, (ii) enoxaparin sodium injection 1 mg/kg every 12 hours subcutaneously, or (iii) heparin intravenous bolus (5000 IU) followed by a continuous infusion (administered to achieve an aPTT of 55 to 85 seconds). A total of 900 patients were randomized in the study and all patients were treated. Patients ranged in age from 18 to 92 years (mean age 60.7 years) with 54.7% men and 45.3% women. All patients also received warfarin sodium (dose adjusted according to PT to achieve an International Normalization Ratio [INR] of 2.0 to 3.0), commencing within 72 hours of initiation of enoxaparin sodium injection or standard heparin therapy, and continuing for 90 days. Enoxaparin sodium injection or standard heparin therapy was administered for a minimum of 5 days and until the targeted warfarin sodium INR was achieved. Both enoxaparin sodium injection regimens were equivalent to standard heparin therapy in reducing the risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism (DVT and/or PE). The efficacy data are provided below (see Table 21).

Anticoagulant Transitioning

As with any high‐risk medication such as anticoagulants, clinical situations may arise that require transitioning to or off of DOAC therapy. Two common transition scenarios include (1) switching between anticoagulants and (2) periprocedural management.

Switching Between Anticoagulants

It is not uncommon to require transition from one anticoagulant to another because of either cost, comorbid conditions, patient preference, hospitalization, thrombotic complications, bleeding complications, or procedures. Five scenarios exist that comprise DOAC therapy switching from/to another anticoagulant:
VKA to DOAC
DOAC to VKA
DOAC to DOAC
DOAC to parenteral anticoagulant
Parenteral anticoagulant to DOAC

For all scenarios, assessment of each drug's pharmacokinetic profile (ie, half‐life), pharmacodynamics profile (INR for VKA or activated partial thromboplastin time for unfractionated heparin, etc), as well as patients' renal function, must be taken into account. The ultimate goal is to limit interruption of the therapeutic anticoagulation during the transition to minimize the risk of atherothrombosis. In certain cases, this requires overlap of the 2 anticoagulants. See Table 6. 92

Table 6
Algorithm for Switching Between Anticoagulants

Transitioning between VKA and DOAC and vice versa requires additional explanation that takes into account the INR measurement. When transitioning from a VKA to a DOAC, the half‐life of the VKA compound is imperative to guide therapy. Since warfarin is the principle VKA utilized in the United States, with a half‐life of ≈36 to 48 hours, it is advisable to stop warfarin and check INR at least 3 days later. DOACs can be initiated once the INR is ≤ 2; see Table 7 for management strategies based on INR values. 38 When converting from a DOAC to a VKA, providers should administer DOACs concomitantly with VKAs because of the VKAs' known slow onset of action (≈5–10 days). 38 An INR should be rechecked between days 3 and 5 of warfarin therapy. INRs should be checked just before the dose of the DOAC because of their ability to elevate INR values. The INRs should be monitored frequently for at least the first month until INR stability has been achieved (ie, ≥ 3 consecutive INR readings at goal).

This kind of patient represents a challenge for clinicians, particularly due to INR therapeutic targets, which should be higher than recommended in other patients due to the lupus anticoagulant positivity.

### Oral anticoagulant therapy: antithrombotic therapy and prevention of thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^112ML7w1]. Chest (2012). Medium credibility.

Vitamin K antagonist (VKA) therapy — monitoring anticoagulant intensity by the international normalized ratio (INR) relies on PT-based calibration and has early-therapy caveats: The PT test is the most common test used to monitor VKA therapy, and during the first few days of warfarin therapy the PT reflects mainly a reduction of factor VII, the half-life of which is approximately 6 h. PT monitoring of VKA treatment is not standardized when expressed in seconds, or as a simple ratio or percentage, so a calibration model adopted in 1982 converts the local PT ratio into an INR, calculated as follows: INR = (patient PT/mean normal PT)ISI or log INR = ISI(log observed PT ratio). For calibration, patients' samples should be selected by rejecting samples beyond the 1.5 to 4.5 INR range, and outliers with a perpendicular distance greater than three residual SDs from the line of relationship should be rejected. Because the half-life of prothrombin is about 60 to 72 h, at least 5 days of overlap is necessary, and the INR is based on ISI values derived from the plasma of patients who had received stable anticoagulant doses for at least 6 weeks; as a result, the INR has not been validated and should be viewed with some skepticism early in the course of warfarin therapy, particularly when results are obtained from different laboratories.

### Continuation of anticoagulation through ambulatory phlebectomy does not impact postoperative bleeding risk [^113DW7aV]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Results

A total of 1853 patients received APs from four outpatient offices within our institutional network during the 7-year study period, with 101 patients (5.5%) on chronic anticoagulation. Demographics, clinical characteristics, and procedural details of all patients before propensity score matching is provided in Supplementary Table I (online only). Within this cohort on chronic anticoagulation, there were three patients (3%) who reported postprocedural bleeding before their follow-up appointment, either by calling the outpatient office or EMR messaging. There were also two patients (2%) who were prescribed oral antibiotics for postprocedural cellulitis. Ecchymosis was also minimal, including five patients (5%) indicating significant ecchymosis at a 1-week follow-up visit. No patient in the total anticoagulation cohort required an emergency room visit or an additional procedure before their planned, scheduled, postoperative visit.

Nonetheless, given the significant differences between these two populations, including comorbid conditions and clinical presentation, we elected to propensity score match patients to like-controls, yielding a total of 140 patients, 70 in each group. Of note, propensity score matching eliminated patients on anticoagulation who tended to be older (> 76 years old), have a history of congestive heart failure, and have a history of previous deep vein thrombosis. This patient cohort was compared for demographic differences, procedural complications, and follow-up sequelae (Fig 1). Of the 70 patients who were on chronic anticoagulation, 25 (35.7%) were taking rivaroxaban, 23 (32.9%) were taking apixaban, 17 (24.3%) were taking warfarin, and the other 5 patients were taking either dabigatran (4.3%) or enoxaparin (2.9%). Reasons for chronic anticoagulation were most often related to atrial fibrillation (56.4%) (Fig 2).

Unlabelled

Essentials Few data exist on outcome of upper extremity deep and superficial vein thrombosis (UEDVT and UESVT). We followed 102 and 55 patients with UEDVT or UESVT, respectively, for a median of 3.5 years. Risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism was low in both diseases, and the mortality high. Postthrombotic symptoms were infrequent and cancer patients had a higher risk of recurrent VTE.

Summary

Background There is scant information on the optimal management and clinical outcome of deep and superficial vein thrombosis of the upper extremity (UEDVT and UESVT). Objectives To explore treatment strategies and the incidence of recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE), mortality, postthrombotic symptoms, and bleeding in patients with UEDVT and UESVT and to assess the prognosis of cancer patients with UEDVT. Patients/methods Follow-up of patients with UEDVT or UESVT, who were enrolled previously in a diagnostic management study. Results We followed 102 and 55 patients with UEDVT and UESVT, respectively, both for a median of 3.5 years. Anticoagulant treatment was started in 100 patients with UEDVT (98%) and in 40 (73%) with UESVT. Nine patients with UEDVT (9%) developed recurrent VTE, 26 (26%) died, 6 (8%) of 72 patients had moderate postthrombotic symptoms, and 5 (5%) experienced major bleeding. One patient with UESVT had a recurrent VTE, 18 (33%) died, none had moderate postthrombotic symptoms, and none had major bleeding. Of the cancer patients with UEDVT, 18% had recurrent VTE vs. 7.5% in non-cancer patients (adjusted hazard ratio 2.2, 95%CI 0.6–8.2). The survival rate was 50% in cancer patients with UEDVT vs. 60% in those without (adjusted HR 0.8, 95%CI 0.4–1.4). Conclusions The risk of recurrent VTE was low in patients with UEDVT, and negligible for UESVT. Mortality was high for both diseases. Postthrombotic symptoms were infrequent and mild. Anticoagulant therapy of UEDVT carried a substantial risk of major bleeding. Cancer patients had a significant risk of recurrent VTE.

Analysis of prospective risk of thrombosis

During a median follow-up of 9.5 years (range: 12 days–13.6 years) and 1076 patient years, 32 patients developed TE (arterial: n = 16, venous: n = 16). The most frequent type of events were lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (n = 6) and pulmonary embolism (n = 6) in the venous vasculature, and cerebrovascular incidents (n = 9) and myocardial infarction (n = 5) in the arterial vasculature. Twenty-one of the 32 events occurred in patients with a prior history of thrombosis ("recurrent thrombosis"), and 11 events occurred in LA-positive patients without a prior history of thrombosis. Data on antithrombotic therapy at the time of thrombosis were available for 31 out of 32 patients (Table 2). Twenty-three (74.2%) of these 31 events occurred while patients were receiving antithrombotic therapy (Table 2). In detail, 14 (45.2%), 4 (12.9%), and 7 (22.6%) of these patients were receiving VKA, low molecular weight heparin, and/or low dose aspirin at the time of thrombosis, respectively. Among the 14 patients receiving VKA, the international normalized ratio (INR) was insufficient (i.e. < 2) in 6 patients, within therapeutic range in 5 patients, and unknown in 3 patients. The cumulative 1-, 5-, 10-, and 15-year incidences of TE accounting for competing mortality were 4.0% (95% CI: 1.7–8.1), 13.3% (95% CI: 8.3–19.4), 24.3% (95% CI: 17.0–32.5), and 27.6% (95% CI: 19.3–36.6), respectively (Additional file 8: Figure S1). With 12 patients having died during follow-up without developing TE, death was clearly present as a competing risk in this population. Of the 32 patients who developed thrombosis during follow-up, 2 patients developed a further TE (1x venous thrombotic event (VTE) after VTE, 1x myocardial infarction after cerebrovascular insult).

### A 17-year-old with chest pain [^112hd7qK]. Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

A 17-year-old male subject with a history of deep venous thrombosis presented with acute unilateral severe chest pain. His examination was nonspecific, and vital signs were normal. His initial laboratory evaluation revealed mild thrombocytopenia, elevated troponin levels, and critically elevated activated partial thromboplastin time. A computed tomography angiogram of the chest revealed a pulmonary embolus, and anticoagulation therapy was initiated. His course was complicated by the development of multiple thrombi and respiratory failure. Extensive evaluation revealed a rare, underlying diagnosis in time for life-saving treatment to be initiated.

### Patient satisfaction with extended international normalized ratio follow-up intervals in a veteran population [^115cnmZ5]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Background: For highly stable warfarin patients, limited data exists regarding patient satisfaction on extended international normalized ratio (INR) follow-up intervals and how this population compares with patients on a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC). Objective: To assess the impact on patient satisfaction of extending INR follow-up intervals. Methods: Veterans on stable warfarin doses had extended INR follow-up intervals up to 12 weeks in a single-arm prospective cohort study for 2 years. This analysis included participants who completed at least 2 Duke Anticoagulation Satisfaction Scales (DASS). The primary outcome was the change in the DASS. A focus group described participant experiences. Participant satisfaction was compared to patients on a DOAC. Results: Of the 51 participants, 48 were included in the warfarin extended INR follow-up group. Compared with baseline, the mean DASS score (42.9 ± 12.08) was worse at 24 months (46.82 ± 15.2, P = 0.0266), with a small effect size (Cohen's d = 0.29). The 8 participants in the focus group were satisfied with the extended INR follow-up interval but would be uncomfortable extending follow-up past 2 to 3 months. The extended INR follow-up interval study had similar DASS scores as the 33 participants included on DOAC therapy (46.8 ± 15.1, P = 0.9970) but may be limited by differing populations using DOACs. Conclusion and Relevance: For patients currently stable on warfarin therapy, extending the INR follow-up interval up to 12 weeks or changing to a DOAC does not appear to improve patient satisfaction.

### Comparison of 1 month with 3 months of anticoagulation for a first episode of venous thromboembolism associated with a transient risk factor [^112bkh1W]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2004). Low credibility.

Background

The risk of recurrence is lower after treatment of an episode of venous thromboembolism associated with a transient risk factor, such as recent surgery, than after an episode associated with a permanent, or no, risk factor. Retrospective analyses suggest that 1 month of anticoagulation is adequate for patients whose venous thromboembolic event was provoked by a transient risk factor.

Methods

In this double-blind study, patients who had completed 1 month of anticoagulant therapy for a first episode of venous thromboembolism provoked by a transient risk factor were randomly assigned to continue warfarin or to placebo for an additional 2 months. Our goal was to determine if the duration of treatment could be reduced without increasing the rate of recurrent venous thromboembolism during 11 months of follow-up.

Results

Of 84 patients assigned to placebo, five (6.0%) had recurrent venous thromboembolism, compared with three of 81 (3.7%) assigned to warfarin, resulting in an absolute risk difference of 2.3%[95% confidence interval (CI) - 5.2, 10.0]. The incidence of recurrent venous thromboembolism after discontinuation of warfarin was 6.8% per patient-year in those who received warfarin for 1 month and 3.2% per patient-year in those who received warfarin for 3 months (rate difference of 3.6% per patient-year; 95% CI - 3.8, 11.0). There were no major bleeds in either group.

Conclusion

Duration of anticoagulant therapy for venous thromboembolism provoked by a transient risk factor should not be reduced from 3 months to 1 month as this is likely to increase recurrent venous thromboembolism without achieving a clinically important decrease in bleeding.

### A systematic review of outcome measures reported for the therapeutic effectiveness of oral anticoagulation [^112cwoJe]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2003). Low credibility.

Aims

To evaluate the evidence of therapeutic international normalised ratio (INR) control reporting and to provide recommendations for future reporting, particularly for research and audit purposes.

Methods

A systematic review of literature published over a five year period describing therapeutic INR control. Papers were identified from the Medline electronic database, and those that met the quality criteria were reviewed independently by an academic general practitioner and a consultant haematologist.

Results

Fifteen papers were identified that met the quality criteria for review. The sample size of studies ranged from 53 to 2545 (mean, 483.9) patients. Follow up ranged from three months to 13 years. Twelve studies reported results from secondary care only, one from primary care only, and two from both primary and secondary care. Seven of the 15 papers reported percentage time in range, five of 15 papers reported mean INR, six of 15 papers reported the proportion of tests in range, and five of 15 papers reported mean warfarin dose. Additional methods of presenting INR results were: dose changes each month, distribution of INR results, deviation of INR value from mean, percentage dose changes, time between visits, and median INR value. Six papers reported only one outcome measure, six reported two outcomes, two papers reported three outcomes, and one paper reported five outcomes.

Conclusions

It is recommended that at least two outcome measures should be reported and measures should be selected so that both the INR determinations and dosing advice are monitored.

### Evidence-based management of anticoagulant therapy: antithrombotic therapy and prevention of thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^1128huug]. Chest (2012). Medium credibility.

Clinical prediction rules for bleeding while taking vitamin K antagonists (VKA) — The annual incidence of warfarin-associated major bleeding is estimated at 1% to 3%, and the performance of a rule was considered moderate if the likelihood ratio for a high score to predict major bleeding was > 5.0 and strong if it was ≥ 10.0; two variants of the same clinical prediction rule had a likelihood ratio of ~9. The independently validated mOBRI (modified Outpatient Bleeding Risk Index) includes predictors age ≥ 65 years, history of stroke, GI bleed in the past 2 weeks, and at least one of the following comorbidities: recent myocardial infarction, hematocrit level < 30%, creatinine level > 1.5 mg/dL, or diabetes mellitus; one point is given for each, with high risk defined as ≥ 3 points. For patients initiating VKA therapy, we suggest against the routine use of clinical prediction rules for bleeding as the sole criterion to withhold VKA therapy (Grade 2C).

### Oral anticoagulant therapy: antithrombotic therapy and prevention of thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^116aPtzG]. Chest (2012). Medium credibility.

Vitamin K antagonist (VKA) therapy — international normalized ratio (INR) monitoring frequency is outlined for inpatient and outpatient care, with randomized and observational data on testing intervals: In hospitalized patients, INR monitoring is usually performed daily until the therapeutic range has been achieved and maintained for at least 2 consecutive days, and in outpatients starting VKA therapy, initial monitoring may be reduced to once every few days until a stable dose response has been achieved. When the INR response is stable, the frequency of testing can be reduced to intervals as long as every 4 to 6 weeks (or possibly longer in particularly stable patients). In a randomized comparison of monitoring intervals in stable mechanical valve patients, there were no differences of time in, above, or below range between 6‑week and 4‑week groups, with actual monitoring intervals of 24.9 days vs 22.5 days (P < .0003). In a retrospective cohort of > 4,000 patients with chronic AF and > 250,000 INRs, time in range increased as the interval decreased from every 5 weeks or more to every 3 weeks (41% to 45%, P < .0005), and investigators suggested that patients should be monitored at time intervals no longer than every 3 weeks; however, the strength of this recommendation is reduced by the very poor TTR reported in both arms of the study.

### Six monthstwo years of oral anticoagulation after a first episode of unprovoked deep-vein thrombosis. the PADIS-DVT randomized clinical trial [^112Sxhmt]. Haematologica (2019). Medium credibility.

Participants

Patients aged 18 years or older who had experienced a first episode of symptomatic unprovoked proximal deep-vein thrombosis and had been initially treated without interruption for 6 (range, 5.5 to 7) months with a vitamin K antagonist [target International Normalized Ratio (INR), 2.0 to 3.0] were eligible for inclusion. Unprovoked proximal deep-vein thrombosis was defined as objectively confirmed symptomatic deep-vein thrombosis located in the popliteal vein or aboveoccurring in the absence of any major reversible risk factor for venous thromboembolism within 3 months before diagnosis and in the absence of active cancer or cancer resolved within less than 2 years prior to the diagnosis of the venous thromboembolism. Reversible risk factors included surgery with locoregional or general anesthesia lasting over 30 min, trauma with or without lower limb immobilization in a plaster cast, and bed-rest for more than 72 h. Estrogen-containing contraception (used by 6 women) was not considered as a major reversible risk factor. No deep-vein thrombosis was related to prolonged travel or hormone replacement therapy. All the index proximal deep-vein thromboses were objectively diagnosed using leg vein ultrasound.

The main exclusion criteria were: previous confirmed pulmonary embolism or proximal deep-vein thrombosis, concomitant symptomatic pulmonary embolism, recurrent venous thromboembolism or bleeding during the initial 6 months of anticoagulation, known major thrombophilia, indication for vitamin K antagonist therapy for reasons other than venous thromboembolism, increased bleeding risk, and life expectancy < 18 months (see the Online Supplement for the full list).

All participants were ambulatory patients enrolled in eight French hospital centers from July 13 th, 2007 to October 16 th, 2013 (last patient/last visit: December 31 st, 2016).

### Warfarin dose assessment every 4 weeks versus every 12 weeks in patients with stable international normalized ratios: a randomized trial [^113YjVYh]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Guidelines recommend that patients receiving warfarin undergo international normalized ratio (INR) monitoring every 4 weeks.

Objective

To investigate whether assessment of warfarin dosing every 12 weeks is as safe as assessment every 4 weeks.

Design

Noninferiority randomized trial. The randomization schedule (in a 1:1 ratio) was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed until the database was locked by using a centralized schedule. Patients, study and clinical personnel, adjudicators of clinical events, and the study statistician were blinded to treatment assignment. (ClinicalTrials.gov registration number: NCT00356759) SETTING: Single center in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.

Patients

250 patients receiving long-term warfarin therapy, whose dose was unchanged for at least 6 months; 226 completed the study.

Intervention

Dosing assessment every 12 weeks (n = 124) compared with every 4 weeks (n = 126) for 12 months. Patients in the 12-week group were tested every 4 weeks; sham INRs within the target range were reported for two of the three 4-week periods.

Measurements

Percentage of time in the therapeutic range (primary outcome) and number of extreme INRs, changes in maintenance dose, major bleeding events, objectively verified thromboembolism, and death (secondary outcomes).

Results

The percentage of time in the therapeutic range was 74.1% (SD, 18.8%) in the 4-week group compared with 71.6% (SD, 20.0%) in the 12-week group (absolute difference, 2.5 percentage points [1-sided 97.5% upper confidence bound, 7.3 percentage points]; noninferiority P = 0.020 for a 7.5-percentage point margin). Fewer patients in the 12-week group than in the 4-week group had any dose changes (37.1% vs. 55.6%; absolute difference, 18.5 percentage points [95% CI, 6.1 to 30.0 percentage points]; P = 0.004). Secondary outcomes did not differ between groups.

Limitations

Patients in the 12-week group had testing and contact with clinic staff every 4 weeks. The study was conducted at a single center and used surrogate outcomes.

Conclusion

Assessment of warfarin dosing every 12 weeks seems to be safe and noninferior to assessment every 4 weeks. A comparison of INR testing, patient contact, and warfarin dose assessment every 12 weeks versus every 4 weeks is necessary before INR testing every 12 weeks can be routinely recommended for practice.

Recommendation strength interpretation notes that the strength of a recommendation is expressed as either strong ("the guideline panel recommends… ") or conditional ("the guideline panel suggests… ") and is interpreted so that for strong recommendations, most individuals in this situation would want the recommended course of action and only a small proportion would not, and most individuals should receive the intervention or test; for conditional recommendations, the majority of individuals in this situation would want the suggested course of action but many would not, and different choices will be appropriate for individual patients and clinicians must help each patient arrive at a management decision consistent with their individual risks, values, and preferences.
