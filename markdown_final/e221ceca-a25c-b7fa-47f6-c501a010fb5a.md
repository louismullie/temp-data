## Question

What are the indications for blood transfusion in thalassemia?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the indications for blood transfusion in thalassemia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical classification that separates transfusion-dependent from non–transfusion-dependent thalassemia. Then, I should verify the specific hemoglobin thresholds and symptomatic criteria that trigger regular transfusions. Next, I will examine the physiologic rationale and targets for transfusion in transfusion-dependent thalassemia. After that, I need to consider special populations such as HbE β-thalassemia and pregnancy. Finally, I should review product specifications, monitoring, and how emerging therapies modify transfusion needs, while double-checking areas where evidence is weak or evolving.

> Let me first confirm the classification because indications hinge on it. Thalassemia is broadly divided into transfusion-dependent thalassemia (TDT), typically β-thalassemia major, and non–transfusion-dependent thalassemia (NTDT), which includes thalassemia intermedia and HbE β-thalassemia; this framing determines whether regular transfusions are indicated versus episodic or supportive use only [^4078a67c] [^fad8f4e3].

> Now, for TDT, I should verify the hemoglobin threshold that prompts initiation of regular transfusions. The Thalassemia Western Consortium recommends starting regular transfusions when hemoglobin is consistently less than 7 g/dL on at least two occasions separated by at least 2 weeks, acknowledging that some patients with β-thalassemia major may already be severely symptomatic at this level and warrant earlier initiation based on clinical judgment [^64924665] [^049470d4].

> Wait, let me verify the symptomatic trigger even when hemoglobin is not below 7 g/dL. The same guidance supports initiating regular transfusions when hemoglobin is 7 g/dL or higher if there are severe symptoms or complications such as growth failure, delayed puberty, bone deformities, symptomatic splenomegaly, or evidence of cardiopulmonary compromise; this aligns with the principle that anemia-related morbidity, not just the absolute hemoglobin value, should guide therapy [^64924665] [^049470d4].

> I need to check the physiologic rationale and transfusion targets once regular transfusions are started. The goals are to suppress ineffective erythropoiesis, support normal growth and development, and prevent complications of chronic anemia; typical practice targets a pretransfusion hemoglobin of about 9.5–10.5 g/dL in β-thalassemia major, with post-transfusion hemoglobin around 13–14 g/dL, balancing symptom control against iron loading, and this approach is supported by consensus statements and transfusion guidance [^372cdc6c] [^c785eb54] [^049470d4].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions for NTDT. I initially thought the same 7 g/dL threshold might apply, but wait, I should correct that. For NTDT, regular transfusions are generally not required for survival; instead, transfusions are reserved for episodic indications such as acute illness, infection, pregnancy, surgery, or when complications emerge, and some patients may evolve to transfusion dependence over time, which reclassifies them as TDT for management purposes [^da837aa8] [^ecf996d8] [^c7269826].

> Let me consider HbE β-thalassemia specifically, because its phenotype spans mild to severe. I should confirm that even when hemoglobin is below 7 g/dL, many patients with HbE β-thalassemia can initially be managed with on-demand transfusions rather than a fixed schedule; however, longitudinal data show substantial morbidity even in so-called milder phenotypes, and some centers adopt a lower transfusion threshold or more intensive regimens based on symptoms and complications, underscoring the need for individualized decisions and close monitoring [^6218f3e9] [^64924665].

> Next, I should review pregnancy, where the threshold shifts. In thalassemia syndromes during pregnancy, maintaining maternal hemoglobin around 10 g/dL with transfusions is recommended to reduce maternal and fetal morbidity; this is a higher target than in nonpregnant NTDT and reflects increased physiologic demands and the risks of placental hypoxia and growth restriction [^f7862315].

> I will now examine product specifications and transfusion logistics because they materially affect outcomes. Leukoreduced RBCs are standard to reduce febrile reactions, and extended antigen matching for C, c, E, e, and Kell is recommended to mitigate alloimmunization; in patients who have already formed alloantibodies, more extensive matching is advised, and RBC genotyping can refine matching strategies, though evidence quality for extended matching is limited and implementation varies by center and resource availability [^ebabf86a] [^28279f6c] [^4200c409].

> But wait, what about iron overload and chelation once transfusions begin. I should confirm that iron chelation is indicated in TDT to prevent transfusional hemosiderosis, with deferasirox, deferoxamine, and deferiprone as options; in NTDT, chelation is indicated when iron burden is significant even without regular transfusions, typically when liver iron concentration is at least 5 mg/g dry weight or ferritin exceeds 300 ng/mL, reflecting increased intestinal iron absorption [^49e62224] [^1f60e25a] [^d06abc28].

> Let me reconsider how evolving therapies modify transfusion needs. Luspatercept is FDA-approved for adults with TDT and can reduce transfusion burden in a subset, and real-world data suggest improvements in pretransfusion hemoglobin in some patients; gene therapy has also entered practice as a potentially curative option for eligible TDT patients, though access and long-term outcomes remain key issues [^dcb00dfa] [^ee89f58e] [^8ccc8243].

> I should double-check the strength of evidence and acknowledge limitations. Much of the transfusion guidance in thalassemia is based on expert consensus and observational data rather than randomized trials, and recent systematic reviews highlight the very low certainty of evidence for extended antigen matching strategies, reinforcing the need for individualized decisions and shared decision-making, especially in NTDT where thresholds are less rigid and phenotype is heterogeneous [^4200c409] [^ed9f6737] [^da837aa8].

> In summary, I need to ensure the decision framework is explicit: initiate regular transfusions in TDT when hemoglobin is consistently less than 7 g/dL or when hemoglobin is 7 g/dL or higher with severe symptoms or complications; maintain pretransfusion hemoglobin around 9.5–10.5 g/dL in β-thalassemia major while balancing iron load; in NTDT, avoid routine transfusions and reserve them for acute needs or complications; in pregnancy, target hemoglobin near 10 g/dL; and throughout, use leukoreduced, appropriately matched RBCs and institute iron chelation to prevent overload, adjusting for patient-specific factors and evolving therapies [^64924665] [^372cdc6c] [^f7862315] [^ebabf86a] [^49e62224].

Transfusion in thalassemia is indicated to **prevent complications of chronic anemia** and **suppress ineffective erythropoiesis** [^372cdc6c]. In transfusion-dependent thalassemia (TDT), regular transfusions are standard to maintain a pre-transfusion hemoglobin of 9–10.5 g/dL [^c785eb54], supporting growth, preventing bone deformities, and reducing extramedullary hematopoiesis [^372cdc6c]. In non–transfusion-dependent thalassemia (NTDT), transfusions are reserved for acute indications such as hemoglobin < 7 g/dL with symptoms, infection, pregnancy, or surgery [^notfound]. Transfusion decisions should be individualized, balancing anemia severity, symptoms, and complications, and always paired with iron chelation to prevent overload [^e4cd3690].

## Indications for transfusion in transfusion-dependent thalassemia (TDT)

TDT, typically β-thalassemia major, is characterized by severe anemia requiring lifelong regular transfusions. The primary goals are to **maintain adequate oxygen delivery**, suppress ineffective erythropoiesis, and prevent complications of chronic anemia [^372cdc6c].

---

### Standard indications

- **Severe anemia**: Hemoglobin consistently < 7 g/dL on two occasions at least 2 weeks apart [^64924665].
- **Growth failure**: Failure to thrive, delayed puberty, or growth retardation despite optimal medical management [^61284245].
- **Bone deformities**: Development of bone deformities or osteoporosis due to marrow expansion [^61284245].
- **Extramedullary hematopoiesis**: Evidence of extramedullary hematopoiesis causing organomegaly or neurological compromise [^notfound].
- **Cardiac complications**: Signs of cardiac dysfunction, such as heart failure or arrhythmias, attributable to chronic anemia [^notfound].

---

### Target hemoglobin levels

Pre-transfusion hemoglobin is typically maintained at **9.0–10.5 g/dL** to balance oxygen delivery with iron loading [^c785eb54]; post-transfusion hemoglobin is generally 13–14 g/dL [^372cdc6c].

---

## Indications for transfusion in non–transfusion-dependent thalassemia (NTDT)

NTDT, including β-thalassemia intermedia and HbE β-thalassemia, generally does not require regular transfusions. However, transfusions may be necessary in specific clinical scenarios [^da837aa8].

---

### Acute indications

- **Severe symptomatic anemia**: Hemoglobin < 7 g/dL with significant symptoms such as fatigue, dyspnea, or dizziness [^notfound].
- **Infection or acute illness**: Acute infections or illnesses exacerbating anemia [^c7269826].
- **Pregnancy**: Pregnancy-related anemia requiring transfusion support [^f7862315].
- **Surgery**: Preoperative or perioperative transfusion support for surgical procedures [^ecf996d8].

---

### Chronic indications

Chronic indications include **progressive anemia** with hemoglobin declining toward 7 g/dL and symptomatic anemia despite optimal medical management, and **complications of ineffective erythropoiesis** such as extramedullary hematopoiesis, bone deformities, or pulmonary hypertension [^085582d4].

---

## Special considerations

### Pregnancy

During pregnancy, **target hemoglobin** is maintained at approximately 10 g/dL to support maternal and fetal well-being [^f7862315]. Transfusions are generally indicated when hemoglobin falls below this threshold or when symptomatic anemia develops.

---

### Iron overload and chelation therapy

Chronic transfusions inevitably lead to iron overload, necessitating **iron chelation therapy** [^e4cd3690]. Deferasirox, deferoxamine, and deferiprone are commonly used chelators, with the choice individualized based on patient age, iron burden, and tolerance [^e4cd3690].

---

## Risks and complications of transfusion

While life-saving, transfusions carry risks, including:

- **Alloimmunization**: Development of red cell alloantibodies, complicating future transfusions [^28279f6c].
- **Iron overload**: Progressive organ dysfunction if not adequately chelated [^f3b1b3b3].
- **Transfusion reactions**: Acute and delayed hemolytic reactions, febrile reactions, and allergic responses [^notfound].
- **Infectious risks**: Hepatitis B, hepatitis C, HIV, and other transfusion-transmitted infections, though modern screening has significantly reduced these risks [^notfound].

---

## Emerging therapies and future directions

Recent advances include **luspatercept**, which reduces transfusion burden in TDT, and **gene therapy**, offering potential cures for selected patients [^dcb00dfa] [^5eb1373f]. These therapies may reshape transfusion indications and frequency in the future [^aa647332].

---

Transfusion in thalassemia is indicated to **prevent complications of chronic anemia** and suppress ineffective erythropoiesis. In TDT, regular transfusions are standard to maintain pre-transfusion hemoglobin at 9–10.5 g/dL, while in NTDT, transfusions are reserved for acute indications or specific complications. Individualized decision-making and iron chelation are essential to optimize outcomes.

Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) have determined, in surgical and critically ill patients, relatively safe hemoglobin (Hb) thresholds of 7–8 g/dL to guide restrictive transfusion of red blood cells (RBCs). However, in patients with various hematologic disorders, strong evidence in support of such an approach is sparse and the optimal transfusion practice is yet to be defined. This review focuses on RBC transfusion practice in three hematologic diseases and a treatment strategy, including autoimmune hemolytic anemia, thalassemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. These entities manifest in a broad spectrum of anemia, acute or chronic, in patients with different comorbidities and degrees of transfusion requirement. Thus the nuances in the indications of RBC transfusion and the goals to achieve in these specific situations may have been underappreciated. The limited data available highlight the importance of titrating RBC transfusion based on the clinical context and patient characteristics. Future RCTs are necessary to firmly establish the Hb thresholds associated with improved outcomes relevant to these specific patient populations, which will facilitate the personalized decision-making in RBC transfusion.

Thalassemia major and sickle cell disease are the two most widely disseminated hereditary hemoglobinopathies in the world. The outlook for affected individuals has improved in recent years due to advances in medical management in the prevention and treatment of complications. However, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is still the only available curative option. The use of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation has been increasing, and outcomes today have substantially improved compared with the past three decades. Current experience world-wide is that more than 90% of patients now survive hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and disease-free survival is around 80%. However, only a few controlled trials have been reported, and decisions on patient selection for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and transplant management remain principally dependent on data from retrospective analyses and on the clinical experience of the transplant centers. This consensus document from the European Blood and Marrow Transplantation Inborn Error Working Party and the Paediatric Diseases Working Party aims to report new data and provide consensus-based recommendations on indications for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and transplant management.

### Challenges in chronic transfusion for patients with thalassemia [^9a3ff803]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2020). Medium credibility.

The introduction of regular red cell transfusions 60 years ago transformed β-thalassemia major from a fatal childhood illness into a chronic disorder. Further advances in the prevention of transfusion-transmitted infections and management of iron overload have allowed survival and quality of life to approach normal. However, transfusion therapy for some other thalassemia syndromes continues to challenge clinical decision-making. Nearly one-half of the patients with E ß thalassemia are transfusion-dependent, yet the criteria for initiating transfusions or hemoglobin targets are not well defined. Patients with thalassemia intermedia who begin transfusions as adults are at very high risk for developing red cell alloimmunization and serious hemolytic transfusion reactions. In the growing number of survivors of Bart hydrops fetalis, the approach to transfusion therapy and iron chelation is rapidly evolving. A collaboration between hematology and transfusion medicine specialists will be essential to improving patient care and developing evidence-based guidelines.

What to know This thalassemia resource for people with thalassemia and their caregivers contains key facts about beta thalassemia and information a healthcare provider considers when developing a transfusion plan for people with β thalassemia. Key facts about β thalassemia
- β thalassemia is an inherited blood disorder.
- People with β thalassemia cannot make enough of a protein called globin, an important part of the hemoglobin that is contained inside red blood cells.
- When not enough hemoglobin is made, there are fewer red blood cells in the bloodstream, so less oxygen reaches the organs and tissues that need it. This condition is called anemia. Healthcare providers follow guidelines to decide if a person with β thalassemia needs regularly occurring blood transfusions to treat the anemia. Once it is determined that someone needs to start receiving regular transfusions, healthcare providers develop a transfusion plan.

The transfusion plan may vary from person to person and may need to be adjusted over time. What information do healthcare providers consider when developing a transfusion plan for people with β thalassemia. Target hemoglobin level The target hemoglobin level is the level that most people with β thalassemia need to ensure normal growth and puberty, to prevent fatigue, and to avoid problems with their spleen. For people receiving regular transfusions, the healthcare provider will monitor hemoglobin levels before each transfusion to make sure it does not fall below the target level. Healthcare providers may refer to this target hemoglobin level as the target. pretransfusion hemoglobin level. In general, for the two types of beta thalassemia below, the target pretransfusion hemoglobin level is
- 9. 5–10. 5 g/dL for people with β thalassemia major
- 9. 0–10. 0 g/dL for people with hemoglobin E. Did you know. grams per deciliter, written g/dL.

Timing of transfusions The transfusion plan also includes a schedule of how often the regular transfusions should occur. This schedule helps maintain the target pretransfusion hemoglobin level and prevent complications for most people with β thalassemia. In general, regular transfusions take place
- Every 3 weeks in most older children and adults with β thalassemia major
- Every 4 weeks in younger children with β thalassemia major and most people with HbE β thalassemia. Additional considerations Healthcare providers also consider these questions when developing a transfusion plan for people with β thalassemia:

- Is their spleen intact.
- How much do they weigh.
- Do they have congestive heart failure.
- Are they severely fatigued.
- Do they have bone pain.
- Do they have pulmonary hypertension. The answers to these questions help determine how often the transfusions will take place and how much blood will be transfused each time. People with β thalassemia may talk with their healthcare provider to understand if they need to start regular transfusions and, if so, what the best transfusion plan is for them.

### Treating iron overload in patients with non-transfusion-dependent thalassemia [^d06abc28]. American Journal of Hematology (2013). Low credibility.

Despite receiving no or only occasional blood transfusions, patients with non-transfusion-dependent thalassemia (NTDT) have increased intestinal iron absorption and can accumulate iron to levels comparable with transfusion-dependent patients. This iron accumulation occurs more slowly in NTDT patients compared to transfusion-dependent thalassemia patients, and complications do not arise until later in life. It remains crucial for these patients' health to monitor and appropriately treat their iron burden. Based on recent data, including a randomized clinical trial on iron chelation in NTDT, a simple iron chelation treatment algorithm is presented to assist physicians with monitoring iron burden and initiating chelation therapy in this group of patients.

### Initiating regular transfusions… [^61284245]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

What to know This thalassemia resource for people with thalassemia and their caregivers contains key facts about beta thalassemia, and information about how β thalassemia affects the body, as well as why and when blood transfusions may be needed. Key facts about β thalassemia
- β thalassemia is an inherited blood disorder.
- People with β thalassemia cannot make enough of a protein called globin, an important part of the hemoglobin that is contained inside red blood cells.
- Hemoglobin picks up oxygen in the lungs and takes it to different parts of the body through the bloodstream. What happens when hemoglobin levels are low in people with β thalassemia. When not enough hemoglobin is made, there are fewer red blood cells in the bloodstream, so less oxygen reaches the organs and tissues that need it. This condition is called anemia. In children with β thalassemia, anemia may cause.
- Fatigue and reduced activity
- Growth problems and delayed puberty
- Enlargement of the liver and spleen
- Bone weakening
- Trouble with memory, concentration, or learning new things In adults with β thalassemia, anemia may cause
- Fatigue and trouble working or performing usual activities
- Bone weakening or fractures
- An overactive spleen that makes it harder to filter old or damaged red blood cells
- Trouble with memory, concentration, or learning new things
- Reduced quality of life. These complications occur because the bone marrow becomes more active. The marrow expands, trying to make up for the anemia by making more red blood cells. These new cells also have reduced hemoglobin levels. When there isn't enough hemoglobin, the body's red blood cells don't function properly, and they last shorter periods of time. This means there are fewer healthy red blood cells traveling in the bloodstream.

Why people with β thalassemia need transfusions Blood transfusions are used to treat anemia in people with β thalassemia. A blood transfusion is usually a safe, common procedure in which a person receives blood through a tiny plastic tube inserted into one of their veins. A blood transfusion increases the hemoglobin, which reduces the anemia and nearly always makes a person feel better quickly. Healthcare providers might recommend episodic transfusions or regularly occurring transfusions based on a person's overall health. Did you know iron supplements could harm a person with β thalassemia. Initiating regular transfusions for people with β thalassemia Healthcare providers follow guidelines to decide whether to recommend episodic or regularly occurring transfusions depending on hemoglobin levels, type of thalassemia, and other things found during a physical exam.

Most people with β thalassemia whose hemoglobin levels are consistently below 7 g/dl might get regularly occurring transfusions. Regular transfusions are also important, even if a person's hemoglobin levels are 7 g/dl or higher, if there are other complications such as.
- Growth problems or delayed puberty
- Bone deformities or fractures
- An enlarged spleen
- Stroke
- Blood clots
- High blood pressure that affects the lungs and heart Did You Know. grams per deciliter, written g/dl. Reference Lal A, Wong T, Keel S, Pagano M, Chung J, Kamdar A, et al.

### Transfusion management of beta (β) thalassemia… [^64924665]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Transfusion Management of Beta Thalassemia: Developing a Transfusion Plan A Thalassemia Resource for Healthcare Providers Download and print this page. Key Facts About β Thalassemia
- β thalassemia is caused by β-globin gene variants that reduce the production of adult hemoglobin which may cause anemia.
- Chronic anemia can have serious consequences for people with β thalassemia.
- **Children**: reduced activity, growth problems and delayed puberty, hepatosplenomegaly, osteopenia, cognitive impairment.
- **Adults**: fatigue, decline in capacity to work or perform usual activities, cognitive impairment, osteopenia, fractures, hypersplenism, reduced quality of life
- The primary management of severe anemia in β thalassemia is regular red cell transfusions.
- The Thalassemia Western Consortium recommends initiating regular transfusions if either of the following conditions are met:

- Hemoglobin < 7g/dL on 2 occasions at least 2 weeks apart
- **Β thalassemia major**: < 7g/dL on 2 occasions, with or without severe symptoms
- **HbE β thalassemia**: < 7 g/dL on 2 occasions AND one or more severe symptoms.
- Hemoglobin __ > __7g/dL, with one or more severe symptoms
- Hemoglobin < 7g/dL on 2 occasions at least 2 weeks apart Once the decision to initiate regular transfusions is made, healthcare providers can develop a transfusion plan to determine the rate, frequency, and volume of transfusions that are needed to maintain a target pretransfusion hemoglobin level. This transfusion plan may differ from person to person and may need to be adjusted over time. What are the Components of a Transfusion Plan for People with β thalassemia.

Target Pretransfusion Hemoglobin Level In general, the target pretransfusion hemoglobin level recommended by the Thalassemia Western Consortium for people with β thalassemia is
- 9. 5–10. 5 g/dL for people with β thalassemia major
- 9. 0–10. 0 g/dL for people with HbE β thalassemia Maintaining these target pretransfusion hemoglobin levels has been previously determined to ensure normal growth, prevent fatigue, and suppress splenomegaly and marrow hyperactivity in most people with β thalassemia. Rate In general, blood is transfused at a rate of
- 5 ml/kg/hour for children
- 200–300 ml/hour, based on tolerance, for adults The shortest time to complete a transfusion safely may differ between people. Frequency In general, people with β thalassemia need transfusions
- Every 3 weeks for most older children and adults with β thalassemia major
- Every 4 weeks for younger children with β thalassemia major and most people with HbE β thalassemia.

The frequency of transfusions may be changed to maintain the target pretransfusion hemoglobin level. A shorter interval between transfusions reduces hemoglobin level variability but requires more frequent visits to the infusion center. A person with β thalassemia who is on a 4-week transfusion schedule requires a larger volume of blood at each transfusion than a person who is on a 3-week transfusion schedule to attain the same target pretransfusion hemoglobin level. Volume In general, the volume of blood transfused for people with β thalassemia major is
- 4 ml/kg per gram increase in hemoglobin desired, up to 20 ml/kg at a single visit for children
- 2, 3, or 4 units per transfusion for adults. Common regimen: 3 units if the pretransfusion hemoglobin level is < 10 g/dl; 2 units if the pretransfusion hemoglobin level is ≥ 10 g/dl The volume of blood transfused during a visit may be changed to maintain the target pretransfusion hemoglobin level.

### Transfusion management in sickle cell disease [^56ea7463]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is the most commonly inherited hemoglobinopathy in the United States. Blood transfusion is a critical part of the multidisciplinary approach necessary in the management of SCD; however, blood transfusions are not without complications. The successful use of transfusion as a treatment strategy in SCD requires the critical review and knowledge of transfusion methods, generally accepted indications, clinical situations in which transfusion generally is not considered, the selection of blood products, and strategies to prevent transfusion-related complications.

### Allogeneic red blood cell transfusions: efficacy, risks, alternatives and indications [^004333e8]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2005). Low credibility.

Careful assessment of risks and benefits has to precede each decision on allogeneic red blood cell (RBC) transfusion. Currently, a number of key issues in transfusion medicine are highly controversial, most importantly the influence of different transfusion thresholds on clinical outcome. The aim of this article is to review current evidence on blood transfusions, to highlight 'hot topics' with respect to efficacy, outcome and risks, and to provide the reader with transfusion guidelines. In addition, a brief synopsis of transfusion alternatives will be given. Based on up-to-date information of current evidence, together with clinical knowledge and experience, the physician will be able to make transfusion decisions that bear the lowest risk for the patient.

### How I treat non-transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia [^da837aa8]. Blood (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Since the previous How I Treat articles focusing on the thalassemias were published in Blood in 2011 and 2018, our armamentarium for the management of these disorders has expanded. In this article, we present 4 cases as examples of the most contemporary clinical approaches to the diagnosis and management of non-transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia (NTDT), specifically β-thalassemia intermedia. Although some aspects of care continue to be extrapolated from transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia (TDT), the approach for patients with NTDT should be individualized while considering opportunities for interventions with the potential of improving short-term or long-term outcomes, such as blood transfusion, iron chelation therapy (ICT), hydroxyurea, and luspatercept. The distinction between TDT and NTDT may vary with time because a patient with NTDT may increasingly depend on regular transfusion support or a patient with TDT may require a less intensive transfusion program with certain interventions.

Therefore, we describe special situations in which the clinical phenotypes merge and highlight opportunities to use conventional and novel therapies to address the underlying pathophysiology based on emerging evidence or otherwise practical considerations for the hematologist.

### Deferasirox oral [^49e62224]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Deferasirox is an iron chelator indicated for the treatment of chronic iron overload due to blood transfusions in patients 2 years of age and older. (1.1)

Deferasirox is indicated for the treatment of chronic iron overload in patients 10 years of age and older with non-transfusion-dependent thalassemia (NTDT) syndromes, and with a liver iron (Fe) concentration (LIC) of at least 5 mg Fe per gram of dry weight (Fe/g dw) and a serum ferritin greater than 300 mcg/L.

Limitations of Use:

The safety and efficacy of deferasirox when administered with other iron chelation therapy have not been established. (1.3)

1.1 Treatment of Chronic Iron Overload Due to Blood Transfusions (Transfusional Iron Overload)

### Management of patients with sickle cell disease using transfusion therapy: guidelines and complications [^98129ce9]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Red blood cell (RBC) transfusion therapy is a key component of comprehensive management of patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) and has increased over time as a means of primary and secondary stroke prevention. RBC transfusions also prove to be lifesaving for many acute sickle cell-related complications. Although episodic and chronic transfusion therapy has significantly improved the morbidity and mortality of patients with SCD, transfusions are not without adverse effects. This review addresses RBC transfusion methods, evidence-based and/or expert panel-based consensus on indications for chronic and episodic transfusion indications, and strategies to prevent and manage transfusion-related complications.

### Indications for transfusion in the management of sickle cell disease [^b0554d07]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2021). Medium credibility.

The transfusion of red blood cells (RBCs) is a crucial treatment for sickle cell disease (SCD). While often beneficial, the frequent use of transfusions is associated with numerous complications. Transfusions should be offered with specific guidelines in mind. Here we present updates to the indications for transfusion of RBCs in SCD. We review recent publications and include expert perspectives from hematology and transfusion medicine. For some clinical indications, such as ischemic stroke, the role of transfusion has been well studied and can be applied almost universally. For many other clinical scenarios, the use of transfusion therapy has less conclusive data and therefore must be tailored to individual needs. We highlight the roles of RBC transfusions in preventing or mitigating neurological disease, in reducing perioperative complications, in managing acute chest syndrome, and in optimizing pregnancy outcomes in SCD. We further highlight various transfusion techniques and when each might be considered. Potential complications of transfusion are also briefly discussed.

INTRODUCTION

In sickle cell disease (SCD; including HbSS, HbSC, HbS‐beta thalassaemia, HbSD, HbSE, HbSO Arab) and thalassaemia, including transfusion‐dependent thalassaemia (TDT), the development of alloantibodies following red blood cell (RBC) transfusion has well‐recognised clinical consequences, including haemolytic transfusion reactions (HTRs) and delays in sourcing appropriately matched RBCs for transfusion. There is a need to understand to what degree the high prevalence of alloimmunisation in SCD and thalassaemia can be prevented by matching transfused RBCs as closely as possible to the RBC antigen phenotype of the patient. The feasibility of providing more extended matched RBC units than is standard practice is dependent on many factors including the size of the donor pool, differences between donor and recipient ethnicity, and the laboratory resources available at the hospital, donor centre, and blood transfusion services. The provision of extended matched RBCs for transfusion may however be associated with delays in transfusion, which may have a clinical impact. There are also concerns that sequestering of RBC units for purposes of prophylactic matching may deplete the availability of antigen‐negative units to patients who have previously formed antibodies, placing these patients at risk of harm.

Previous evidence‐based guidelines have provided recommendations for prophylactic RBC matching beyond ABO and RhD in patients with SCD and thalassaemia aimed at reducing risks of alloimmunisation. Such practices are relevant both in patients who have never developed an alloantibody, and in those who have been previously alloimmunised, but with the added need to minimise the formation of new alloantibodies. In 2018, the International Collaboration for Transfusion Medicine Guidelines (ICTMG)made several recommendations based on a systematic review of 18 published studies (Appendix A). However, recommendations are not always consistent across guidelines, and a subsequent position paper from the British Society for Haematology (BSH)raised uncertainties about the recommendations to provide extensive phenotype‐matched RBC in patients who had acquired any RBC alloantibodies. As part of an ongoing need to review guidelines in response to new literature, this evidence‐based guideline was commissioned by ICTMG. An updated systematic review of relevant literature evidence was conducted for studies published after 2015. An international panel of experts was convened to review the new literature and to determine whether previous recommendations were still appropriate and relevant to the current clinical practice and literature or needed updating.

### Beta thalassemia: monitoring and new treatment approaches [^ecd30607]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Beta thalassemias are a significant global health problem. Globin chain imbalance leads to a complex physiologic cascade of hemolytic anemia, ineffective erythropoiesis, and iron overload. Management of the broad spectrum of phenotypes requires the careful use of red blood transfusions, supportive care, monitoring, and management of iron overload. In this article, the authors discuss recommendations for monitoring of individuals with thalassemia, as well as ongoing preclinical and clinical trials of therapies targeting different aspects of thalassemia pathophysiology.

### Luspatercept for β-thalassemia: beyond red blood cell transfusions [^aa647332]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Red blood cell transfusions and iron chelation therapy are the cornerstone of treatment for β-thalassemia, with allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and gene therapy offering further disease-management options for eligible patients. With up to 90% of severe cases of β-thalassemia occurring in resource-constrained countries, and estimates indicating that 22,500 deaths occur annually as a direct consequence of undertransfusion, provision of adequate treatment remains a major issue.

Areas Covered

In this review, we provide an overview of luspatercept, a first-in-class erythroid maturation agent, and present the available clinical data related to the treatment of β-thalassemia.

Expert Opinion

The recent approval of luspatercept offers a new, long-term therapeutic option for adult patients with transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia to reduce red blood cell transfusion burden, anemia, and iron overload.

### Blood transfusions for treating acute chest syndrome in people with sickle cell disease [^e9d8df9d]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Sickle cell disease is an inherited autosomal recessive blood condition and is one of the most prevalent genetic blood diseases worldwide. Acute chest syndrome is a frequent complication of sickle cell disease, as well as a major cause of morbidity and the greatest single cause of mortality in children with sickle cell disease. Standard treatment may include intravenous hydration, oxygen as treatment for hypoxia, antibiotics to treat the infectious cause and blood transfusions may be given. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2010.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of blood transfusions, simple and exchange, for treating acute chest syndrome by comparing improvement in symptoms and clinical outcomes against standard care.

Search Methods

We searched The Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register, which comprises references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearching of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. Date of the most recent search: 25 April 2016.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials and quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing either simple or exchange transfusion versus standard care (no transfusion) in people with sickle cell disease suffering from acute chest syndrome.

Data Collection and Analysis

Both authors independently selected trials and assessed the risk of bias, no data could be extracted.

Main Results

One trial was eligible for inclusion in the review. While in the multicentre trial 237 people were enrolled (169 SCC, 42 SC, 15 Sβ⁰-thalassemia, 11Sβ(+)-thalassemia); the majority were recruited to an observational arm and only ten participants met the inclusion criteria for randomisation. Of these, four were randomised to the transfusion arm and received a single transfusion of 7 to 13 ml/kg packed red blood cells, and six were randomised to standard care. None of the four participants who received packed red blood cells developed acute chest syndrome, while 33% (two participants) developed acute chest syndrome in standard care arm. No data for any pre-defined outcomes were available.

Authors' Conclusions

We found only one very small randomised controlled trial; this is not enough to make any reliable conclusion to support the use of blood transfusion. Whilst there appears to be some indication that chronic blood transfusion may play a roll in reducing the incidence of acute chest syndrome in people with sickle cell disease and albeit offering transfusions may be a widely accepted clinical practice, there is currently no reliable evidence to support or refute the perceived benefits of these as treatment options; very limited information about any of the potential harms associated with these interventions or indeed guidance that can be used to aid clinical decision making. Clinicians should therefore base any treatment decisions on a combination of; their clinical experience, individual circumstances and the unique characteristics and preferences of adequately informed people with sickle cell disease who are suffering with acute chest syndrome. This review highlights the need of further high quality research to provide reliable evidence for the effectiveness of these interventions for the relief of the symptoms of acute chest syndrome in people with sickle cell disease.

### American Society of Hematology 2020 guidelines for sickle cell disease: transfusion support [^9321364f]. Blood Advances (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Red cell transfusions remain a mainstay of therapy for patients with sickle cell disease (SCD), but pose significant clinical challenges. Guidance for specific indications and administration of transfusion, as well as screening, prevention, and management of alloimmunization, delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions (DHTRs), and iron overload may improve outcomes.

Objective

Our objective was to develop evidence-based guidelines to support patients, clinicians, and other healthcare professionals in their decisions about transfusion support for SCD and the management of transfusion-related complications.

Methods

The American Society of Hematology formed a multidisciplinary panel that was balanced to minimize bias from conflicts of interest and that included a patient representative. The panel prioritized clinical questions and outcomes. The Mayo Clinic Evidence-Based Practice Research Program supported the guideline development process. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was used to form recommendations, which were subject to public comment.

Results

The panel developed 10 recommendations focused on red cell antigen typing and matching, indications, and mode of administration (simple vs red cell exchange), as well as screening, prevention, and management of alloimmunization, DHTRs, and iron overload.

Conclusions

The majority of panel recommendations were conditional due to the paucity of direct, high-certainty evidence for outcomes of interest. Research priorities were identified, including prospective studies to understand the role of serologic vs genotypic red cell matching, the mechanism of HTRs resulting from specific alloantigens to inform therapy, the role and timing of regular transfusions during pregnancy for women, and the optimal treatment of transfusional iron overload in SCD.

This article discusses the approach for recognition, diagnosis, and management of the thalassemias, and reviews new prospects of therapy, focusing mostly on the beta-thalassemias — the more severe and clinically important type, beta-thalassemia major is typically treated with regular transfusion and chelation therapy. New strategies for specific therapy including monitoring of iron induced organ damage, fetal hemoglobin augmentation as an alternative for transfusions, bone marrow transplantation offer hope for prevention of complications and better care of the beta-thalassemias.

### Red cell specifications for blood group matching in patients with haemoglobinopathies: an updated systematic review and clinical practice guideline from the International Collaboration for Transfusion Medicine Guidelines [^b46b236a]. British Journal of Haematology (2025). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

The guideline panel recognised the paucity of evidence favouring the use of extended matching strategies. Well‐designed adequately resourced studies are needed to inform how to reduce alloimmunisation and hence the risks related to transfusion, especially in vulnerable patient groups who rely on transfusion as a primary treatment for their conditions. Specific matching strategies, if implemented, may need to be further adapted for different areas of the world depending on donor profiles.

### Red blood cell transfusion: 2023 AABB international guidelines [^a48ea723]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

AABB 2023 red blood cell transfusion — evidence base and general conclusions: For adults, 45 randomized controlled trials with 20 599 participants compared restrictive hemoglobin-based transfusion thresholds, typically 7 to 8 g/dL, with liberal transfusion thresholds of 9 to 10 g/dL; for pediatric patients, 7 randomized controlled trials with 2730 participants compared a variety of restrictive and liberal transfusion thresholds, and for most adult patient populations, results provided moderate certainty evidence that restrictive transfusion thresholds did not adversely affect patient-important outcomes; it is good practice to consider overall clinical context and alternative therapies to transfusion when making transfusion decisions about an individual patient.

### Survival and complications in patients with haemoglobin E thalassaemia in sri lanka: a prospective, longitudinal cohort study [^6218f3e9]. The Lancet: Global Health (2022). High credibility.

Regarding the fundamental question of which patients with haemoglobin E thalassaemia should have transfusions and on what regimens, our findings could guide future work. Judicious withdrawal of transfusions in this study permitted identification of approximately 50% of patients who were able to continue on-demand transfusions. Compared with patients requiring regularly scheduled transfusions, these patients appeared to have a milder phenotype, as suggested by several factors including a clinically modest but statistically significant higher mean steady-state haemoglobin concentration, consistent with our previous findings. However, even in patients with this mild phenotype, the safety of on-demand transfusions might be questioned because of the high prevalence of complications that emerged in this study. Although maintenance of steady-state haemoglobin concentrations of 4·5 g/dL (the threshold for survival identified for haemoglobin E thalassaemia in this study) is not recommended, uncertainty persists as to the optimal target haemoglobin concentration, and by extension intensity of transfusions, in this disorder. In several countries, many affected children begin prescheduled transfusions at diagnosis; one study reported the primary, and arbitrary, indication for this approach was the country of birth. Furthermore, traditional guidelines for transfusions in thalassaemia that propose maintenance of steady-state haemoglobin concentrations of 9·5–10·0 g/dL arise from one small retrospective study in European patients with thalassaemia major. Whether such a regimen is appropriate in all patients with haemoglobin E thalassaemia, many of whom might adapt better to anaemia related to the decreased oxygen affinity of haemoglobin Eand who, even when irregularly transfused, have better survival than those with thalassaemia major, remains unclear.

Our study has limitations. During the 20-year period, approaches to management shifted, complicating some evaluations. There is little information on deaths, and no post-mortem data. Quantitative measurements of body iron burden were were not regularly assessed, because of resource constraints. Baseline haemoglobin F concentrations were not assessed in most patients. Resting ejection fractions provide little information about cardiac reserve or iron loading. Haemoglobin and serum ferritin concentrations changed over the life course of patients; although we considered haemoglobin and recent ferritin concentrations, time-dependent analysis could be considered in future. Another limitation was that, before the study, transfusions had been started in many patients without adequate iron-chelation therapy; it, therefore, became the priority to reduce, where possible, transfusions in patients with iron burdens associated with increased risk of death. Access to chelation therapy continued to be problematic, limiting transfusion approaches in many patients.

### Non-transfusion-dependent thalassemias [^45137086]. Haematologica (2013). Low credibility.

Non-transfusion-dependent thalassemias include a variety of phenotypes that, unlike patients with beta (β)-thalassemia major, do not require regular transfusion therapy for survival. The most commonly investigated forms are β-thalassemia intermedia, hemoglobin E/β-thalassemia, and α-thalassemia intermedia (hemoglobin H disease). However, transfusion-independence in such patients is not without side effects. Ineffective erythropoiesis and peripheral hemolysis, the hallmarks of disease process, lead to a variety of subsequent pathophysiologies including iron overload and hypercoagulability that ultimately lead to a number of serious clinical morbidities. Thus, prompt and accurate diagnosis of non-transfusion-dependent thalassemia is essential to ensure early intervention. Although several management options are currently available, the need to develop more novel therapeutics is justified by recent advances in our understanding of the mechanisms of disease. Such efforts require wide international collaboration, especially since non-transfusion-dependent thalassemias are no longer bound to low- and middle-income countries but have spread to large multiethnic cities in Europe and the Americas due to continued migration.

### Treating iron overload in patients with non-transfusion-dependent thalassemia [^c7269826]. American Journal of Hematology (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Although patients with NTDT are generally considered to have a less severe form of thalassemia compared with patients with transfusion-dependent disease, over time, they can achieve similar levels of liver iron. By definition, NTDT patients are not dependent on blood transfusions for their survival. They may receive occasional transfusion therapy; for example, in the case of growth retardation, infection, severe anemia, or pregnancy. In general, the main contributor to total iron burden is increased intestinal absorption rather than blood transfusions.

Adequate assessment, monitoring and iron chelation treatment of NTDT patients are crucial for preventing the complications known to be associated with increased iron burden. Recent advances in the understanding of the mechanisms of iron overload in NTDT patients and the relationship between LIC and serum ferritin have prompted a need for re-evaluation of previous treatment recommendations. There are currently no standard clinical practice guidelines for the treatment of iron overload in NTDT patients.

Recent randomized trial data showing the efficacy and manageable safety profile of iron chelation in NTDT support the use of iron chelation therapy the NTDT patient population. Revision of previous treatment guidelines is necessary to reflect these recent advances and provide further guidance for physicians who care for NTDT patients.

The International Collaboration for Transfusion Medicine Guidelines (ICTMG) has published guidance on transfusion for haemoglobinopathies. To give a UK perspective on this guidance, each of the recommendations in the ICTMG guideline were reviewed and the applicability for transfusion practice in the UK considered with reference to relevant published British Society for Haematology (BSH) guidelines and national standards. There was much consensus; however, there was disparity surrounding the recommendations for routinely extended matching in those with alloimmunisation.

### Survival and causes of death in 2, 033 patients with non-transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia [^ecf996d8]. Haematologica (2021). Medium credibility.

Non-transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia (NTDT) is a broad term encompassing patients who do not require lifelong transfusion therapy for survival. NTDT patients commonly, but not exclusively, present to medical care later in childhood (commonly > 2 years of age) and with milder anemia and clinical symptoms compared to patients with transfusion-dependent forms. Our understanding of the disease process in NTDT has evolved significantly over the past two decades and it is now established that a diagnosis of NTDT can be associated with greater morbidity than previously recognized. Ineffective erythropoiesis and peripheral hemolysis lead to a state of chronic anemia, which can impact organ function in the long-term. There is a significant correlation between the degree of anemia and morbidity development in this NTDT patient population. Ineffective erythropoiesis is also linked to other pathogeneses manifesting as extramedullary hematopoiesis, bone disease, hypercoagulability and vascular disease, as well as primary iron overload due to increased intestinal iron absorption. Iron overload can be cumulative and leads to end-organ damage, especially in the liver. Despite advances in realizing risk factors and morbidity in NTDT, data on mortality and causes of death remain limited.

There are currently no approved drugs for the management of ineffective erythropoiesis, or anemia, in NTDT. Thus, despite the terminology, many patients are given sporadic transfusions or are even placed on regular transfusion programs later in their disease course. This is commonly undertaken in situations of acute stress (during pregnancy, surgery, or infection), in the context of supporting growth and development, or for the management and prevention of complications in adulthood. Decisions are often based on the physician's judgement, since management guidelines have only become available since 2013 and do not necessarily provide specific recommendations for transfusion therapy or for other erythropoiesis modulators when data from clinical trials is absent. Iron chelation therapy has been used in patients with NTDT for decades, but this have primarily based on expert opinion since data from dedicated clinical trials and management guidelines have only become available in the last 10 years.

### Clinical classification, screening and diagnosis for thalassemia [^fad8f4e3]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

At present, thalassemia diseases are classified into transfusion-dependent thalassemia and non-transfusion-dependent thalassemia. This classification is based on the clinical severity of patients determining whether they do require regular blood transfusions to survive (transfusion-dependent thalassemia) or not (non-transfusion-dependent thalassemia). In addition to the previous terminology of "thalassemia major" or "thalassemia intermedia", this classification has embraced all other forms of thalassemia syndromes such as α-thalassemia, hemoglobin E/β-thalassemia and combined α- and β-thalassemias. Definitive diagnosis of thalassemia and hemoglobinopathies requires a comprehensive workup from complete blood count, hemoglobin analysis, and molecular studies to identify mutations of globin genes.

The complex pathophysiology in β-thalassemia can translate to multiple morbidities that affect every organ system. Improved survival due to advances in management means that patients are exposed to the harmful effects of ineffective erythropoiesis, anemia, and iron overload for a longer duration, and we started seeing new or more frequent complications in adult compared with younger patients. In this article, we highlight particular aspects of managing adult patients with β-thalassemia, using our own experience in treating such patients. We cover both transfusion-dependent and nontransfusion-dependent forms of the disease and tackle specific morbidities of highest interest.

### Red cell specifications for blood group matching in patients with haemoglobinopathies: an updated systematic review and clinical practice guideline from the International Collaboration for Transfusion Medicine Guidelines [^4200c409]. British Journal of Haematology (2025). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

This updated literature review and evidence‐based clinical practice guideline continue to struggle to make recommendations for a beneficial role of extended matching of RBCs for patients with SCD and thalassaemia, a group with significant transfusion exposure and a high burden of clinically relevant alloimmunisation. This largely results from the lack of high‐quality evidence and uncertainty about whether extended‐matching reduces the risk of alloimmunisation or HTRs in this patient population. Our review has highlighted multiple research needs. Above all, well‐designed studies, with clear analysis plans for reporting alloimmunisation rates in the context of pre‐study baseline transfusion information, are required. Research priorities should include:
Improving our understanding of how patient factors, such as ethnicity and genetic modifiers of alloimmunisation risk (which may vary globally) and the clinical context in which transfusions are administered (e.g. episodic or chronic, elective or during acute illness) may influence the role of extended matching.
Identifying which patients benefit most from extended prophylactic matching and whether subgroups of patients might be better suited to different policies for extended matching.
Evaluating the clinical and operational impact of implementing policies for extended prophylactic matching on patients with existing alloantibodies.
Assessing how the advent of genotyping technologies may impact the ability to deliver extended matched RBCs and better define the need/ability to match for variants, particularly in the Rh group.
Ensuring new studies provide clear descriptions of the local standard of practice (in particular explaining in detail RBC matching practices), report alloimmunisation rates as prevalence and incidence to better enable comparisons between studies, and that time periods during which the antibodies are identified are clearly stated. This may be best achieved through prospective data collection and starting prior to first transfusions. In addition, new studies may want to consider collecting additional data for factors such as the age of RBC units, leukodepletion (often poorly described in studies) and haemoglobin S status of the RBC units transfused to assess how these affect transfusion outcomes in patients with haemoglobinopathies.
Evaluating whether the use of RBC donations from HbS carriers should be considered for all patients, even those with strict post‐transfusion HbS% targets, such as seen in the management of ischaemic stroke. Due to the difficulty in accurately measuring post‐transfusion HbS%, this is currently avoided at many centres, but the inclusion of these donations would increase the pool of donors of similar ethnicity and genotype for patients with SCD.
Incorporating health economic research into the adoption of more stringent or extensive prophylactic matching strategies for patients with SCD or thalassaemia. Studies need to consider the feasibility of providing alternate matching strategies in different parts of the world.
Establishing the selection of appropriate, consistent, and meaningful patient‐focussed outcomes for clinical research, including both benefits and risks. There continues to be a need for accurate data on adverse events related to transfusion, including transfusion reactions, timely availability of blood, and the challenges and cost implications of different matching strategies.
Identifying efficient ways of recruiting and retaining donors whose ethnicities correlate with patients affected by inherited RBC disorders to further minimise and manage the risks associated with alloimmunisation.

10.3 Blood transfusion in pregnant women with hemoglobinopathy

Blood transfusion is indicated to treat acute anemia in pregnant women with sickle cell disease, but there is no consensus on the exact hemoglobin concentration below which transfusion should be considered. Most authors recommended transfusion when the hemoglobin concentration is below 5–7 g/dL (the steady‐state hemoglobin concentration in sickle cell disease is usually in the range of 6–8 g/dL), or above 2 g/dL below the steady‐state hemoglobin concentration, or above 20% reduction from the steady‐state hemoglobin concentration.,

Current evidence from systematic and Cochrane reviews does not support routine prophylactic blood transfusion in pregnant women with sickle cell disease. Restricting blood transfusion in pregnant women with sickle cell disease to situations in which it is clinically indicated reduces the risks of alloimmunization, viral infections, and iron overload. For pregnant women with thalassemia syndromes, hemoglobin concentration should be maintained at a target of 10 g/dL with transfusions to avoid maternal and fetal morbidity.

### Developing a transfusion plan… [^049470d4]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

What to know This thalassemia resource for healthcare providers contains information on key facts about beta thalassemia, the components of a transfusion plan for people with β thalassemia, and transfusion considerations for people with β thalassemia. Key facts about β thalassemia β thalassemia is caused by β-globin gene variants that reduce the production of adult hemoglobin which may cause anemia. Chronic anemia can have serious consequences for people with β thalassemia. Children can experience reduced activity, growth problems and delayed puberty, hepatosplenomegaly, osteopenia, and cognitive impairment. Adults may experience fatigue, decline in capacity to work or perform usual activities, cognitive impairment, osteopenia, fractures, hypersplenism, reduced quality of life. The primary management of severe anemia in β thalassemia is regular red cell transfusions.

The Thalassemia Western Consortium recommends initiating regular transfusions if either of the following conditions are met: 1) Hemoglobin < 7g/dL on 2 occasions at least 2 weeks apart
- **Β thalassemia major**: < 7g/dL on 2 occasions, with or without severe symptoms
- **HbE β thalassemia**: < 7 g/dL on 2 occasions AND one or more severe symptoms. 2) Hemoglobin ≥ 7 g/dL, with one or more severe symptoms Once the decision to initiate regular transfusions is made, healthcare providers can develop a transfusion plan to determine the rate, frequency, and volume of transfusions that are needed to maintain a target pretransfusion hemoglobin level. This transfusion plan may differ from person to person and may need to be adjusted over time. What are the components of a transfusion plan for people with β thalassemia.

Target pretransfusion hemoglobin level In general, the target pretransfusion hemoglobin level recommended by the Thalassemia Western Consortium for people with β thalassemia is
- 9. 5–10. 5 g/dL for people with β thalassemia major
- 9. 0–10. 0 g/dL for people with HbE β thalassemia Maintaining these target pretransfusion hemoglobin levels has been previously determined to ensure normal growth, prevent fatigue, and suppress splenomegaly and marrow hyperactivity in most people with β thalassemia. Rate In general, blood is transfused at a rate of
- 5 ml/kg/hour for children
- 200–300 ml/hour, based on tolerance, for adults The shortest time to complete a transfusion safely may differ between people. Frequency In general, people with β thalassemia need transfusions
- Every 3 weeks for most older children and adults with β thalassemia major
- Every 4 weeks for younger children with β thalassemia major and most people with HbE β thalassemia.

The frequency of transfusions may be changed to maintain the target pretransfusion hemoglobin level. A shorter interval between transfusions reduces hemoglobin level variability but requires more frequent visits to the infusion center. A person with β thalassemia who is on a 4-week transfusion schedule requires a larger volume of blood at each transfusion than a person who is on a 3-week transfusion schedule to attain the same target pretransfusion hemoglobin level. Volume In general, the volume of blood transfused for people with β thalassemia major is
- 4 ml/kg per gram increase in hemoglobin desired, up to 20 ml/kg at a single visit for children
- 2, 3, or 4 units per transfusion for adults. Common regimen: 3 units if the pretransfusion hemoglobin level is < 10 g/dL; 2 units if the pretransfusion hemoglobin level is ≥ 10 g/dL The volume of blood transfused during a visit may be changed to maintain the target pretransfusion hemoglobin level.

---

### Current evidence and rationale to guide perioperative management, including transfusion decisions, in patients with sickle cell disease [^590994c2]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2023). Medium credibility.

When to Consider Preoperative Transfusion

Currently, ASH does suggest transfusion over no preoperative transfusion in all patients with SCD undergoing surgery requiring general anesthesia and lasting > 1 hour, which is a conditional recommendation based on very low certainty data. The guidelines note that decision should be individualized based on genotype, risk of surgery, baseline hemoglobin, prior transfusion-related complications, and disease severity.

We, therefore, recommend exercising caution in patients with underlying SCD-related complications, especially underlying pulmonary disease or prior transfusion-related complications, given the increased risk of volume overload in this population. Preoperative transfusion needs should be made in consultation with a hematologist familiar with the management of people with SCD. At our institutions, we approach each patient individually, taking into account their SCD genotype, risk level of surgery, baseline total hemoglobin, complications with prior transfusion, known blood antigens, and SCD disease severity. All patients receive leukoreduced, nonsickle trait blood as is recommended by ASH. Additionally, patients receive ABO and Rh-antigen matched blood. Patients with known antibodies should receive extending matching based on phenotype, which includes matching beyond ABO and Rh-antigens, such as Jka/Jkb, Fya/Fyb, and S/s antigens. Additionally, whenever possible, we recommend prophylactic extended phenotypic matching for patients without known antibodies if available, as is suggested by ASH for patients with SCD of all genotypes. However, in emergency settings, it is reasonable to give O ¯ blood, regardless of shelf-life and sickle trait status, if necessary.

Figure 2.
Preoperative transfusion management. In addition to the above transfusion parameters, we additionally recommend that all patients receive leukoreduced, nonsickle trait blood. All patients should also receive ABO and Rh-antigen-matched blood, and patients with known antibodies should receive extended matching based on their phenotype.

When transfusing preoperatively, we recommend simple transfusion if Hb < 8.5 g/dL for patients with all SCD genotypes, with a posttransfusion hemoglobin goal no > 11 g/dL to avoid the risk of hyperviscosity (Figure 2). We recommend exchange transfusion if total hemoglobin ≥ 8.5 g/dL, with a posttransfusion goal of 10 to 11 g/dL. We do not target a specific HbS% at our institutions for patients with HbSS (or HbS/β 0 -thalassemia) disease; however, we recommend a target HbA of 70% for patients with HbSC or HbS/β + -thalassemia disease.

### Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for people with ß-thalassaemia major [^593af4a6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Thalassemia is an inherited blood disorder, caused by mutations in regulatory genes and transmitted as an autosomal recessive disorder, which results in a reduced rate of synthesis of one of the globin chains that make up haemoglobin. In ß-thalassaemia major there is an underproduction of ß-globin chains combined with excess of free α-globin chains. The excess free α-globin chains damage the red blood cell membranes, leading to their destruction and a phenomenon termed ineffective erythropoiesis. The conventional approach to treatment is based on the correction of haemoglobin status through regular blood transfusions and iron chelation therapy for iron overload. Although conventional treatment has the capacity to improve the quality of life of people with ß-thalassaemia major, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is the only currently available procedure which has the potential to definitively cure the disease.

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of different types of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, in people with severe transfusion-dependant ß-thalassaemia major, ß-thalassaemia intermedia or ß0/+- thalassaemia variants requiring chronic blood transfusion.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. Date of the most recent search: 11 November 2013.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials and quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation with each other or with standard therapy (regular transfusion and chelation regimen).

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened studies and had planned to extract data and assess risk of bias using standard Cochrane Collaboration methodologies but no studies were identified for inclusion.

Main Results

No relevant studies were retrieved after a comprehensive search of the literature.

Authors' Conclusions

We were unable to identify any randomised controlled trials or quasi-randomised controlled trials on the effectiveness and safety of different types of allogeneic stem cell transplantation in people with severe transfusion-dependant ß-thalassaemia major or ß0/+- thalassaemia variants requiring chronic blood transfusion. The absence of high-level evidence for the effectiveness of these interventions emphasises the need for well-designed, adequately-powered, randomised controlled clinical trials.

### Hydroxyurea for reducing blood transfusion in non-transfusion dependent beta thalassaemias [^c104117b]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Non-transfusion dependent beta thalassaemia is a subset of inherited haemoglobin disorders characterised by reduced production of the beta globin chain of the haemoglobin molecule leading to anaemia of varying severity. Although blood transfusion is not a necessity for survival, it is required when episodes of chronic anaemia occur. This chronic anaemia can impair growth and affect quality of life. People with non-transfusion dependent beta thalassaemia suffer from iron overload due to their body's increased capability of absorbing iron from food sources. Iron overload becomes more pronounced in those requiring blood transfusion. People with a higher foetal haemoglobin level have been found to require fewer blood transfusions. Hydroxyurea has been used to increase foetal haemoglobin level; however, its efficacy in reducing transfusion, chronic anaemia complications and its safety need to be established.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness, safety and appropriate dose regimen of hydroxyurea in people with non-transfusion dependent beta thalassaemia (haemoglobin E combined with beta thalassaemia and beta thalassaemia intermedia).

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of relevant journals. We also searched ongoing trials registries and the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews. Date of last search: 30 April 2016.

Selection Criteria

Randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials of hydroxyurea in people with non-transfusion dependent beta thalassaemia comparing hydroxyurea with placebo or standard treatment or comparing different doses of hydroxyurea.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently applied the inclusion criteria in order to select trials for inclusion. Both authors assessed the risk of bias of trials and extracted the data. A third author verified these assessments.

Main Results

No trials comparing hydroxyurea with placebo or standard care were found. However, we included one randomised controlled trial (n = 61) comparing 20 mg/kg/day with 10 mg/kg/day of hydroxyurea for 24 weeks. Both haemoglobin and foetal haemoglobin levels were lower at 24 weeks in the 20 mg group compared with the 10 mg group, mean difference -2.39 (95% confidence interval - 2.8 to -1.98) and mean difference -1.5 (95% confidence interval -1.83 to -1.17), respectively. Major adverse effects were significantly more common in the 20 mg group, for neutropenia risk ratio 9.93 (95% confidence interval 1.34 to 73.97) and for thrombocytopenia risk ratio 3.68 (95% confidence interval 1.13 to 12.07). No difference was reported for minor adverse effects (gastrointestinal disturbances and raised liver enzymes). The effect of hydroxyurea on transfusion frequency was not reported. The overall quality for the outcomes reported was graded as very low mainly because the outcomes were derived from only one small study with an unclear method of allocation concealment.

Authors' Conclusions

There is no evidence from randomised controlled trials to show whether hydroxyurea has any effect compared with controls on the need for blood transfusion. Administration of 10 mg/kg/day compared to 20 mg/kg/day of hydroxyurea resulted in higher haemoglobin levels and seems safer with fewer adverse effects. It has not been reported whether hydroxyurea is capable of reducing the need for blood transfusion. Large well-designed randomised controlled trials with sufficient duration of follow up are recommended.

### Evidence-based medicine and management of hepatocellular carcinoma in thalassemia [^acb59f0e]. BMC Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Hepatocellular carcinoma as a complication is linked to improved outcomes of thalassemia.

Main Body

Published data suggest an incidence of HCC in thalassemia of about 2%. However, since thalassemia is endemic in many under-developed countries where patients have not probably been screened for HCC yet, the burden of the disease could be higher. Prevention of HCV infection through blood transfusion, HCV treatment and adequate iron chelation are all tools to prevent HCC in thalassemia. In presence of risk factors, HCC screening seems appropriate for thalassemia. Management of HCC should not be different from that indicated for non thalassemics. However, liver transplantation can be challenging and should be reserved to highly selected cases, due to coexistence of relevant comorbidities. Decisions in the management of HCC in thalassemia should follow a multidisciplinary effort. Moreover, due to the paucity of published data about the issue, future multicenter international studies will be helpful.

Short Conclusion

In BMC Gastroenterology results of a commendable effort to guidelines for the management of HCC in thalassemia are reported by an Italian panel of experts. However, due to the paucity of published data about the topic, some conclusions rely on grey areas and are reason of debate.

### Real-world use of iron chelators [^e4cd3690]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2011). Low credibility.

Whereas RBC transfusion therapy is lifesaving in thalassemia, obligatory iron loading accompanies such treatment and chelation therapy to remove and detoxify iron resulting from these chronic transfusions must therefore be administered. Morbidity and mortality in thalassemia is linked closely to the adequacy of chelation. Three chelators are currently available worldwide-deferoxamine, deferasirox, and deferiprone, although the latter is available in North America only in research protocols and compassionate use programs. These chelators can be used as monotherapy or in combination, although only the combination of deferiprone and deferoxamine has been extensively studied to date. Several factors, including chelator availability and its properties, drug tolerability, degree of organ-specific iron loading, ongoing transfusional iron burden, and patient preference, must be considered in the design of optimal, individualized chelation regimens, and these factors must periodically be reviewed and chelation adjusted accordingly. Ultimately, comparative effectiveness trials may help to determine the ideal strategy (eg, intensification of monotherapy or combined therapy including agents and doses) for treating various scenarios of organ-specific iron loading.

### How I treat non-transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia [^eca10f8d]. Blood (2023). Medium credibility.

Practical challenges and final thoughts

As we now understand that untreated anemia carries detrimental long-term consequences in patients with NTDT, research and development are being geared toward finding the best approach to therapy. Although transfusions and agents such as hydroxyurea have been around and used in other hemoglobinopathies for decades, they may not necessarily specifically address the unmet need in this patient population, which not only requires anemia correction but also demands a treatment option that is safe and durable for such a chronic disease. Amidst the excitement about upcoming novel therapies, we are cognizant of the limited affordability and access to novel therapies in many regions of the globe where the disease is most prevalent.

Because patients with NTDT are living longer and experiencing longer-term morbidities than previously, it is imperative to establish a timely and appropriate diagnosis to allow preventive care and appropriate risk mitigation. Unlike patients with TDT who receive frequent follow-up as a byproduct of the need for frequent and regular transfusion therapy, patients with NTDT may not be easily identified or appropriately monitored. Engaging primary care providers in areas of higher prevalence may help early identification of patients, before the onset of morbidities. In parallel, developing the local expertise and coalescing efforts toward the development of national and regional centers of excellence can foster the advancement of clinical trials and guide local communities and clinics in the care of patients with NTDT.

With NTDT being a disease mostly diagnosed in childhood, the transition from pediatric to adult clinics is fraught with its own hurdles. Therefore, we recommend starting the process early, involving both the parent and the patient in the conversation, empowering the child or adolescent to assume progressive responsibility, and harnessing the expertise of the multidisciplinary team, including the nurse, the social worker, the pediatric hematologist, the adult hematologist, the psychologist when needed, and the financial counselor when applicable.

### Thalassaemia [^4078a67c]. Lancet (2022). Excellent credibility.

Thalassaemia is a diverse group of genetic disorders with a worldwide distribution affecting globin chain synthesis. The pathogenesis of thalassaemia lies in the unbalanced globin chain production, leading to ineffective erythropoiesis, increased haemolysis, and deranged iron homoeostasis. The clinical phenotype shows heterogeneity, ranging from close to normal without complications to severe requiring lifelong transfusion support. Conservative treatment with transfusion and iron chelation has transformed the natural history of thalassaemia major into a chronic disease with a prolonged life expectancy, albeit with co-morbidities and substantial disease burden. Curative therapy with allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation is advocated for suitable patients. The understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease is guiding therapeutic advances. Novel agents have shown efficacy in improving anaemia and transfusion burden, and initial results from gene therapy approaches are promising. Despite scientific developments, worldwide inequality in the access of health resources is a major concern, because most patients live in underserved areas.

Thalassemia intermedia — transfusion needs and cardiovascular implications: The cardiovascular manifestations are beyond this document's scope but typically include a greater propensity to pulmonary hypertension and thrombosis; in thalassemia intermedia there is a very variable increase in gastrointestinal iron uptake, patients generally do not require transfusions to maintain hemoglobin and form part of the spectrum of non–transfusion-dependent thalassemias, yet with aging some may require transfusions to prevent complications including cardiovascular ones, which leads to iron loading and an increased requirement for iron chelation.

### Gene therapies for transfusion dependent β-thalassemia: current status and critical criteria for success [^f3a0db25]. American Journal of Hematology (2020). Medium credibility.

Thalassemia is one of the most prevalent monogenic diseases usually caused by quantitative defects in the production of β-globin leading to severe anemia. Technological advances in genome sequencing, stem cell selection, viral vector development, transduction and gene editing strategies now allow for efficient exvivo genetic manipulation of human stem cells that can lead to production of hemoglobin, leading to a meaningful clinical benefit in thalassemia patients. In this review, the status of the gene-therapy approaches available for transfusion dependent thalassemia are discussed, along with the critical criteria that affect efficacy and lessons that have been learned from the early phase clinical trials. Salient steps necessary for the clinical development, manufacturing, and regulatory approvals of gene therapies for thalassemia are also highlighted, so that the potential of these therapies can be realized. It is highly anticipated that gene therapies will soon become a treatment option for patients lacking compatible donors for hematopoietic stem cell transplant and will offer an alternative for definitive treatment of β-thalassemia.

### Treatment of thalassemia… [^8ccc8243]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Treatments for thalassemia depend on the type and how serious it is.
- Blood transfusions are the main way to treat moderate or severe thalassemia.
- People receiving regular blood transfusions are at risk for certain complications such as iron overload, alloimmunization, and infection.
- People receiving transfusions may need ongoing treatment to remove excess iron before it builds up and damages the organs. How is thalassemia treated. The type of treatment a person receives depends on the type of thalassemia they have. In people with severe thalassemia, there are fewer red blood cells and less hemoglobin in the body. This leads to more severe anemia. Blood transfusions One way to treat anemia is to provide the body with more red blood cells to carry oxygen. This can be done through a blood transfusion, a safe, common procedure in which you receive blood through a small plastic tube inserted into one of your blood vessels.

Some people with thalassemia – usually with thalassemia major – need regular blood transfusions because their body makes such low amounts of hemoglobin. People who are transfused regularly are at risk for a complication known as iron overload. Iron overload is when too much iron builds up in the body. The excess iron can make it hard for organs such as the heart and liver to work properly. Chelation therapy is used to prevent iron overload. This therapy removes excess iron before it builds up in the organs. People with thalassemia intermedia may need blood transfusions sometimes, such as when they have an infection or an illness. People with thalassemia minor or trait usually do not need blood transfusions because they either do not have anemia or have only a mild anemia. Folic acid Many times people with thalassemia are prescribed a supplemental B vitamin, known as folic acid, to help treat anemia.

Folic acid can help red blood cells develop. Treatment with folic acid is usually done in addition to other therapies. Gene therapy In January 2024, the U. S. Food and Drug Administration approved CASGEVY™, a cell-based gene therapy for the treatment of transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia in patients 12 years and older. CASGEVY™ is also known as exagamglogene autotemcel. The product is made from patients' own blood stem cells. The stem cells are taken, modified, and given back as a one-time, single-dose infusion as part of a blood stem cell transplant. Prior to treatment, a patients' own stem cells are collected. Then the patient must undergo high-dose chemotherapy. This is a process that removes cells from the patient's bone marrow so they can be replaced with the modified stem cells. More information about CASGEVY™ can be found on the FDA website and the Cooley's Anemia Foundation website.

Hear Robert Mannino 's tips on how to successfully transition to adult care for thalassemia. Transfusion complications How do blood transfusions affect my body. People who receive a lot of blood transfusions are at risk for iron overload. Red blood cells contain a lot of iron, and over time, the iron from all of the transfusions can build up in the body. When it builds up, the iron collects in places like the heart, liver, and brain, and can make it hard for these organs to work properly. To prevent iron overload, people with thalassemia may need chelation therapy, which is when doctors give a medicine – either a pill or a shot under the skin – to remove excess iron before it builds up in the organs. Hear Robert Mannino discuss how iron overload affects the body and why it is important to stay on track with thalassemia treatments. Every time a person gets a blood transfusion, their risk for a problem called "alloimmunization" goes up.

### Best practices in gene therapy for sickle cell disease and transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia [^508ee238]. Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Sickle cell disease (SCD) and transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia (TDT) are inherited blood disorders caused by pathogenic variants of the β-globin gene. Historically, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) from human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched donors has been the only curative option. However, as most patients with SCD or TDT lack HLA-matched donors, autologous or patient-derived HSCT can provide an alternative, transformative option. Gene therapy-based autologous HSCT for the treatment of SCD and TDT entails a complex patient journey and requires the careful implementation of numerous policies and procedures. As gene therapies for these diseases are now commercially available, there is great value in institutions with developed and implemented approaches sharing their best practices. Here, we describe standardized approaches and best practices for the optimized implementation of gene therapies based on our experience in administering this novel class of medicines.

### Gene therapy and gene editing for β-thalassemia [^5eb1373f]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

After many years of intensive research, emerging data from clinical trials indicate that gene therapy for transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia is now possible. Strategies for therapeutic manipulation of patient hematopoietic stem cells include lentiviral transduction of a functional erythroid-expressed β-globin gene and genome editing to activate fetal hemoglobin production in patient red blood cells. Gene therapy for β-thalassemia and other blood disorders will invariably improve as experience accumulates over time. The best overall approaches are not known and perhaps not yet established. Gene therapy comes at a high cost, and collaboration between multiple stakeholders is required to ensure that these new medicines are administered equitably.

### Reducing transfusion utilization for children with sickle cell anemia in sub-saharan Africa with hydroxyurea: analysis from the phase I / II REACH trial [^fdcc62ac]. American Journal of Hematology (2024). Medium credibility.

2.3 | Transfusion data collection

Transfusions were recorded prospectively in the REACH REDCap database. The decision to transfuse was made independently by local clinicians, and donated blood units were collected, processed, screened, and distributed in accordance with each country's national policy. All transfusions of whole blood or packed red blood cells (pRBC) across the four clinical sites were included in this analysis. Descriptive data about the transfusion events included transfusion date, transfusion location (REACH site vs. alternate site), clinical indications, type of blood product (whole blood or pRBC), volume transfused in mL or units, and when available, blood group and cross-match results, the pre-transfusion and post-transfusion hemoglobin values and supplemental diagnostic test results. If recognized, transfusion reactions were recorded as clinical Adverse Events. The clinical indications were specified by the local clinicians and were cross-referenced with other study data including malaria assessments, laboratory values, and adverse events. Although multiple clinical indications could be selected during the trial, a principal indication was identified for analysis (Figure S1).

Demographic data were also collected from the database, including date of birth, sex, G6PD and alpha-thalassemia status, and country of residence. Physical exam and laboratory parameters at study enrollment, at each scheduled visit, and at presentation for transfusion were recorded if available. Transfusions were categorized based on the treatment period of the participant when the transfusion occurred; these categories include pre-treatment (screening), fixed-dose (months 0–6), dose escalation (months 7–24), and treatment at MTD (months 24 onward). If on treatment, the duration that the participant had received hydroxyurea was recorded.

### Optimal management of β thalassaemia intermedia [^8e3a1555]. British Journal of Haematology (2011). Low credibility.

Our understanding of the molecular and pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the disease process in patients with β thalassaemia intermedia (TI) has substantially increased over the past decade. The hallmark of disease process in patients with TI includes ineffective erythropoiesis, chronic haemolytic anaemia, and iron overload. There are a number of options currently available for managing patients with TI including splenectomy, transfusion therapy, iron chelation therapy, modulation of fetal haemoglobin production, and several other agents targeting specific clinical complications. Limited studies assessed the efficacy and safety of these modalities; hence, there are currently no clear guidelines for managing patients with TI. Until solid evidence-based guidelines are available, individualised treatment should be entertained.

### Italian society of hematology practice guidelines for the management of iron overload in thalassemia major and related disorders [^ec1b45fe]. Haematologica (2008). Low credibility.

New measures of iron accumulation in liver and heart (superconducting quantum inference device and magnetic resonance imaging), and oral iron chelators (deferiprone and deferasirox) are available for managing iron overload in thalassemia major. To assure appropriate use of these new health technologies, the Italian Society of Hematology appointed a panel of experts to produce clinical practice-guidelines for the management of iron overload in thalassemia major and related disorders. The analytical hierarchy process, a technique for multicriteria decision analysis, was applied to relevant key questions in order to identify the alternative strategies, generate explicit criteria for their evaluation, and check how well the alternatives fulfilled the criteria. The result of a comprehensive systematic review of articles released from 1990 to 2007 was used as a source of scientific evidence to compare the decisional options pairwise, and select the final recommendation. Every step in the model was developed from questionnaires and group discussion. The resulting recommendations advise about which examination to carry out in order to plan iron chelation therapy, when to start iron chelation, which iron chelator to choose in regularly transfused patients, how to monitor iron chelation therapy, and when and how to switch standard therapy.

### Decision-making about gene therapy in transfusion dependent thalassemia [^68926d07]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Transfusion dependent thalassemia (TDT) is a major public health problem with substantial economic, personal and health care burdens worldwide. An estimated 56,000 babies are born annually with major thalassemia, of which 30,000 require transfusions to survive. In developing countries, where the large majority of patients with TDT reside, chronic transfusion therapy is often not feasible. Even among those with access to safe and adequate transfusion, only a small minority have access to adequate chelation therapy to prevent or treat transfusional iron overload and less than 40% of transfused patients receive adequate chelation.

Hematopoietic stem cell therapy (HSCT) offers a curative treatment option with event free and overall survival rates of 80% and 90% respectively for HLA-identical sibling donor transplants. However, less than 25% of patients are likely to find suitable matched sibling donor for transplant. Alternate donor HSCT, is associated with lower overall survival and higher risks of graft versus host disease (GVHD). The emergence of gene therapy (GT) involving the transplantation of genetically modified autologous hematopoietic stem cells has the potential to eliminate the need for an allogeneic donor and the risk of GVHD, and greatly expand the applicability of HSCT for TDT.

### What to transfuse: specifications for red cell products… [^ebabf86a]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

What to know This thalassemia resource for healthcare providers contains information about transfusion management of beta thalassemia. It covers information about β thalassemia and describes key considerations for selecting red blood cell products for people with β thalassemia who receive regular blood transfusions. Key facts about β thalassemia
- β thalassemia is caused by β-globin gene variants that reduce the production of adult hemoglobin, which may cause anemia.
- Chronic anemia can have serious consequences for people with β thalassemia. Children may experience: reduced activity, growth problems and delayed puberty, hepatosplenomegaly, osteopenia, and cognitive impairment. Adults may experience: fatigue, decline in capacity to work or perform usual activities, cognitive impairment, osteopenia, fractures, hypersplenism, and reduced quality of life.
- The primary management of severe anemia in β thalassemia is regular red blood cell transfusions.

Healthcare providers can work with their blood bank partners to develop thalassemia-specific red blood cell transfusion protocols. In selecting RBC products for patients receiving regular transfusions, it's important for the clinical team to carefully consider which products emphasize efficacy while also minimizing risk of hemolytic and non-hemolytic transfusion complications. What type of RBC product is needed by people with β thalassemia. The optimization of RBC products is vital when transfusing people with β thalassemia. The Thalassemia Western Consortium recommends.
- Leukoreduction of RBC units via filtration during the pre-storage period to prevent febrile non-hemolytic transfusion reactions
- Storage of RBC units in additive solutions or citrate phosphate dextrose-adenine
- Using non-apheresis-derived RBC units for transfusions in adults due to smaller hemoglobin increments with apheresis-derived units.
- Washed RBC units for individuals who experience severe, recurrent allergic reactions
- RBC units that are less than 2 weeks old, when possible, to reduce the impact of the storage lesion on red cell survival
- Using non-irradiated RBC units, as routine use of irradiated RBC units may be detrimental. What type of RBC antigen matching is needed by people with β thalassemia. Prevention of red cell alloimmunization is an important goal of transfusion management in thalassemia.

Ideally, an individual's RBC genotyping is performed once the decision to initiate regular transfusions is made. The results of this typing determine their risk for developing alloantibodies and/or autoantibodies and determine the extent to which antigen-matched blood is needed. The Thalassemia Western Consortium recommends:

- Individuals without a history of alloimmunization are given RBC units matched to Cc, Ee, and K blood group antigens
- Individuals with one or more alloantibodies are given RBC units matched to Cc, Ee, K, Jka/b, Fya/b, and Ss blood group antigens It is important for providers to maintain an accurate antibody history, as an antibody screen can become negative over time, and individuals with a history of developing antibodies need antigen-negative blood to prevent hemolytic transfusion reactions.

### Β-thalassemia and ocular implications: a systematic review [^b3ce4154]. BMC Ophthalmology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Thalassemia is a severe genetic blood disorder caused by a mutation in the globin gene. Abnormal globin chains lead to the excessive destruction of red blood cells. The phenotypes of homozygous or genetic heterozygous compound beta-thalassemias include thalassemia major (TM) and thalassemia intermedia (TI). Individuals with thalassemia major usually come to medical attention within the first two years of life. These patients require lifelong RBC transfusions at regular intervals to survive. Thalassemia intermedia includes patients with milder symptoms, who present at an older age and do not require regular transfusions. More than 42,000 newborns are affected by Beta-thalassemia every year worldwide. Without blood transfusions, Beta-thalassemia major (TM) causes death amongst infected children before the age of 3 years old. Although transfusions can prevent death and decrease mortality, iron accumulated from transfused red blood cells can lead to organ failure. Iron chelation treatment, to reduce iron store in the body and improve the long-term survival rate of patients with TM, is considered a mandatory adjuvant therapy.

As a group, the thalassemias are the most common single gene disorder in the world. High prevalence occurs in developing regions as well as in large multiethnic Western cities due to an expanding immigrant population. The inheritance of β-thalassemias is recessive. The mutations in the β-globin gene and consequent defective β-chain production leads to a devastating cascade: imbalance in α/β- globin chain synthesis, ineffective erythropoiesis, reduced red blood cell survival and subsequent anemia. Although the disease is confirmed genetically, the phenotype of β-thalassemia is determined based on clinical observation.

Therapeutic measures resulted in a progressive improvement in life expectancy in both developed and developing countries. Increased awareness, better education and optimal health care provision efforts, a large body of evidence attained by clinical trials and observational studies conducted in the last 3 decades, allowed for remarkable advances in diagnostic and therapeutic options. Milestones in this effort include the introduction of guidelines for safe processing of blood products, noninvasive techniques for the assessment of iron overload in target organs, oral iron chelators, and prevention/management schemes for specific complications.

### Red cell specifications for blood group matching in patients with haemoglobinopathies: an updated systematic review and clinical practice guideline from the International Collaboration for Transfusion Medicine Guidelines [^ed9f6737]. British Journal of Haematology (2025). Medium credibility.

Patient values and preferences

For this guideline, we wanted to understand the values and preferences of patient representatives with lived experiences of haemoglobinopathies as patients, caregivers, or patient advocates. Patient representatives indicated that high value should be placed on avoiding the adverse effects of alloimmunisation associated with RBC transfusion without compromising the timely supply of blood as needed (e.g. during surgery or in emergencies). The patient representatives were aware of the value of conserving resources related to RBC transfusions and the ongoing need to ensure that the blood donor population appropriately reflected the serological needs of transfused patients, which will vary globally. Patient representatives acknowledged the importance of a diverse and appropriately sized donor pool and being able to ensure rare blood is allocated equitably, which are considerable challenges, particularly in low and middle‐resource country settings.

summary

The GRADE evidence assessment for studies reporting the proportion of patients developing clinically significant antibodies and volume/units of RBCs transfused is presented in Table 3. As seen in the table, the certainty of evidence to recommend an extended matching strategy for both outcomes is very low. This is due to the high RoB across studies reporting on both outcomes and high inconsistency due to treatment arms not being equal in size across studies, different follow‐up times, and indirectness, as some studies did not report the current standard of care. In addition, the decreased transfusion volumes observed in patients receiving extended matching may have reflected greater reticence by physicians in transfusing this group due to the presence of their alloantibodies, or decreased availability of suitably matched units, rather than a decreased product haemolysis.

BLOOD TRANSFUSION FOR PATIENTS WITH

Blood transfusion remains both a major treatment — as well as a commonly employed preventive strategy — for complications of SCD. Almost nine in 10 adults with SCD in LMICs receive an RBC transfusion in their lifetime. In LMICs, the primary driver for blood utilization in patients with SCD occurs in the emergency setting, as many patients are severely anaemic upon arrival at the hospital. Complications such as malaria‐associated anaemia, acute splenic sequestration, ACS, sepsis, acute stroke and multiorgan failure are major indications for emergent blood transfusion. The scarcity of blood contributes to an increase in the mortality rate in these patients during their hospitalization.

Chronic transfusion therapy is also employed and may be administered as simple transfusion (infusing blood without removing or exchanging the patient's own blood), partial manual exchange transfusion (phlebotomy is undertaken immediately prior to simple transfusion) or automated exchange transfusion (concomitant removal of a patient's blood and infusion of donor blood via apheresis technology).

Chronic transfusion therapy has been shown to benefit patients with SCD, particularly those individuals with a history of stroke. Prophylactic transfusion therapy may also confer benefits to pregnant patients with SCD. In the Stroke Prevention Trial in Sickle Cell Anaemia (STOP trial), children with SCD and elevated TCD velocities who received prophylactic transfusion therapy had a 92% lower risk of stroke than those children who received standard of care. In the STOP II trial, the incidence of high‐risk TCD findings or overt stroke was significantly greater in those children whose TCDs had normalized after 30 months of transfusion therapy and subsequently stopped transfusions compared to those who continued chronic transfusion therapy. Additional studies have assessed whether children with a history of stroke or abnormal TCDs can be transitioned from chronic transfusion therapy to hydroxyurea after a particular amount of time; the findings have demonstrated that hydroxyurea may not be inferior to chronic blood transfusion in certain patients. Thus, this may be cost‐effective, reducing the transfusion burden. Nevertheless, transfusion remains the standard of care for acute neurological events and ACS.

### Luspatercept for transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia: real-world experience in a large cohort of patients from Italy [^ee89f58e]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). Medium credibility.

FIGURE 1
Erythroid response parameters.

The pre‐transfusion hemoglobin (Hb) level following a non‐clinically significant increase in the first 12 weeks (p = 0.024) did not differ from that of the pre‐treatment period (Figure 1C). However, this observation varied when considering only patients who started luspatercept with suboptimal pre‐transfusion Hb values according to the international guidelines (< 9.5 g/dL). At the first follow‐up, Hb levels significantly improved (p < 0.001) and stabilized afterward (Figure 1D). Of the 109 patients with baseline Hb < 9.5 g/dL, 32 achieved optimal pre‐transfusion Hb levels, while either maintaining the same transfusion requirements or reducing the need for blood transfusions. The estimated average increase in Hb level was 1.1 g/dL (95% CI: 0.9–1.3). Using the same response criteria as in the BELIEVE trial, some of them would have been classified as non‐responders. However, we believe that this outcome is just as significant as the reduction in blood transfusion since it may have substantial practical benefits. Recent evidence shows an association between higher pre‐transfusion Hb levels and lower thalassemia‐related mortality in adults with TDT. This association seems to begin with Hb levels at or exceeding 9.5 g/dL, the cutoff that we considered in our analysis in reference to international guidelines, and protective effects are incremental with higher levels.

When examining patients classified as good or excellent responders, univariate logistic regression revealed a significant association between a positive response and splenectomy, therapy initiation at > 32 years of age, as well as older age at diagnosis of thalassemia and at start of regular transfusion (Table S6). Even correcting for age at first transfusion, older ages at baseline were associated with a better response to luspatercept but the strength of association significance decreased (p = 0.057). In other words, the best responders to the treatment seemed to be those with 'residual erythropoiesis', which is the retained or potential ability to produce RBCs, in presence of determinants that facilitate the drug's therapeutic activity.

Consistent with this hypothesis and with the findings of Panzieri et al. we observed a correlation between response probability and HbF levels: if HbF was < 0.6 g/dL at baseline, the probability of non‐response was high (Figure S4).

Hydroxyurea is taken once a day orally and is supplied as a capsule, fast-dissolving tablet, or compounded liquid. Myelosuppression is a potential adverse effect, and a CBC and reticulocyte count is monitored every 1 to 3 months depending on treatment duration and dose stability.

Transfusion therapy for inherited anemias and acquired refractory anemias both improves the quality of life and prolongs survival. A consequence of chronic transfusion therapy is secondary iron overload, which adversely affects the function of the heart, the liver and other organs. This session will review the use of iron chelating agents in the management of transfusion-induced secondary iron overload. In Section I Dr. John Porter describes techniques for the administration of deferoxamine that exploit the pharmacokinetic properties of the drug and minimize potential toxic side effects. The experience with chelation therapy in patients with thalassemia and sickle cell disease will be reviewed and guidelines will be suggested for chelation therapy of chronically transfused adults with refractory anemias. In Section II Dr. Nancy Olivieri examines the clinical consequences of transfusion-induced secondary iron overload and suggests criteria useful in determining the optimal timing of the initiation of chelation therapy. Finally, Dr. Olivieri discusses the clinical trials evaluating orally administered iron chelators.

The decision to initiate iron chelation in NTDT patients depends on the estimated extent of iron overload in each patient (Figure 2 shows a proposed treatment algorithm for iron overlaod in NTDT). Body iron monitoring should begin when the patient is 10 years old. The following applies to alpha-thalassemia, especially HbH disease which can be devided into deletional (–/–α) and non-deletional (–/αTα or –/ααT) type: Patients with non-deletional mutations usually have a more anemic phenotype than deletional HbH and they may require infrequent blood transfusions and/or splenectomy. A decision with regards to iron monitoring in non-deletional HbH should therefore depend on a patients' blood transfusion history. In general, patients with deletional type HbH typically accumulate iron much slower than other NTDT patients, and monitoring can begin at 15 years of age.

Measuring serum ferritin is a simple method that may act as a surrogate to estimate the extent of total iron load. We recommend that chelation should be initiated if serum ferritin rises above 800 ng/mL, with the objective of reducing levels to 300 ng/mL. Chelation therapy dosing should be titrated if serum ferritin continues to rise, or if it falls too quickly. Serum ferritin should also be used for monitoring patients' progress over the course of chelation therapy.

When serum ferritin levels are between 300 ng/mL and 800 ng/mL, LIC should be measured to more accurately determine the extent of iron overload. LIC can be measured directly, either by biopsy or by a non-invasive method such as MRI. Initiation of chelation therapy should be started at a LIC of 5 mg Fe/g dw. Previous treatment algorithms have suggested a LIC threshold of 7 mg Fe/g dw, for initiating chelation. However, recent evidence showing increased prevalence of morbidities at LIC of 6-7and ≥ 5 mg Fe/g dw, has prompted this revised recommendation. Chelation therapy should be initiated at LIC ≥ 5 mg Fe/g dw in order to prevent complications before they develop. If direct measurement of LIC is not available, then the decision to initiate chelation should be made on an individual basis and should be guided by the treating physicians' opinion.

### Red cell specifications for blood group matching in patients with haemoglobinopathies: an updated systematic review and clinical practice guideline from the International Collaboration for Transfusion Medicine Guidelines [^e9ae49d5]. British Journal of Haematology (2025). Medium credibility.

Limitations

An important limitation of our updated guideline is the very low quality of evidence from the observational studies. We only included comparative studies in our search strategy. Large (non‐comparator) datasets presenting information on rates of alloimmunisation (e.g. antibodies per number of units transfused) over time, with clearly defined matching strategies may add additional information relevant to our questions. It should be noted that, whilst our review included both prospective and retrospective studies, our summary statistics on alloimmunisation predominantly originate from large retrospective datasets with long follow‐up. We did not capture data that have been reported to haemovigilance schemes internationally unless such data were also published in a peer reviewed journal that was subject to the searches.

### Evidence-based medicine and management of hepatocellular carcinoma in thalassemia [^65be8519]. BMC Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Thalassaemias are rare inherited haemoglobin disorders, endemic in the Mediterranean Area and South-East Asia. Depending on severity, there are two clinical forms: thalassemia major (TM), in which severe anemia starts during the first year of life, requires life-long periodic transfusion management; and thalassemia intermedia (TI), in which anemia has later onset and is generally milder, allowing survival without any regular transfusion. However, today the TM-TI dichotomy should be considered outdated, and, for both clinical and research purposes, thalassemias should be divided in transfusion dependent (TDT) and non-transfusion dependent (NTDT).

### Can N-acetylcysteine reduce red blood cell transfusion burden in patients with transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia? [^07fedc4f]. Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

Patients with beta-thalassemia major require lifelong and frequent red blood cell transfusions for survival, impacting their quality of life and life expectancy. This treatment approach poses risks of organ damage, iron overload, and increased transfusion-transmitted diseases. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) has been studied for its potential antioxidant effects on hemoglobin stability, aiming to reduce the burden of red blood cell transfusions. To explore this possibility further, we conducted a quasi-experimental study involving 35 individuals with thalassemia major over six months All subjects were already receiving iron chelators and blood transfusions. They were given a daily oral dose of 10mg/kg NAC for three months. After three months of treatment with NAC, the serum levels of ferritin and liver enzymes (SGOT and SGPT) did not show significant changes (p = 0.35, p = 0.352, and p = 0.686, respectively). However, the red blood cell transfusion burden was significantly reduced in all patients after NAC therapy (p = 0.029), with no corresponding decrease in serum hemoglobin levels (p = 0.931), indicating maintained hemoglobin concentration despite reduced transfusion volume. The study indicates that NAC can effectively decrease the burden of red blood cell transfusions without significant toxicity in these patients. This finding suggests the potential for NAC as a cost-effective and manageable treatment option for these patients. A larger clinical trial with more robust statistical methods could further confirm these results and pave the way for using NAC as a valuable therapeutic agent for managing beta-thalassemia major patients.

### Treating iron overload in patients with non-transfusion-dependent thalassemia [^24d66720]. American Journal of Hematology (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

The thalassemias are a group of inherited disorders that are caused by altered or absent hemoglobin chain synthesis leading to ineffective erythropoiesis and subsequent anemia. The symptoms of these diseases can vary substantially in severity–. Some patients, like those with the carrier genotypes, have no clinically obvious symptoms. Others, like β-thalassemia major patients, depend on lifelong transfusions for survival.

Non-transfusion-dependent thalassemia (NTDT) is a recently introduced term used to describe those thalassemia phenotypes that do not require regular blood transfusions for survival. Patients with very severe HbE/β-thalassemia may require regular blood transfusions, but these and other patients requiring regular transfusions would not be considered NTDT patients for the purposes of treating iron overload. Patients who are dependent on transfusions, regardless of genotype, would be managed as β-thalassemia major patients.

NTDT comprises a range of hemoglobin disorders including β-thalassemia intermedia, α-thalassemia (mainly HbH disease), HbE/β-thalassemia, HbS/β-thalassemia, and HbC thalassemia. The most prevalent forms of NTDT worldwide are HbH disease, HbE/β-thalassemia, and β-thalassemia intermedia. NTDTs primarily exist in low- or middle-income countries of the tropical belt stretching from sub-Saharan Africa, through the Mediterranean region and the Middle East, to South and Southeast Asia. However, recent global population movements have also led to increasing incidence in areas of the world previously relatively unaffected by these conditions, such as North Europe and the Americas.

Clinical features of NTDT are variable, making diagnosis of NTDT challenging. Both the β-thalassemia intermedia and HbE/β-thalassemia phenotypes show a wide spectrum of disease severity. Patients may have a very mild phenotype and normal growth, or may exhibit severe anemia, growth retardation, hypersplenism, and a variety of morbidities that may eventually require regular transfusion therapy. Patients with HbH disease present with anemia, splenomegaly, jaundice, and growth retardation–. Patients who have HbH along with the Constant Spring or Paksé mutation have a much more severe clinical phenotype. Several genetic and environmental factors are known to modify phenotype in NTDT; however, the diagnosis remains largely clinical and is based on the severity of the patient's condition.

### Consensus statement for the perinatal management of patients with α thalassemia major [^94862ff8]. Blood Advances (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

A strong consensus emerged among the multidisciplinary attendees at this international conference: ATM should no longer be considered universally fatal. Although decision making during pregnancy is complex and personal, and the availability of medical care varies globally, parents should be offered nondirective counseling regarding all options, including that of fetal therapy with IUTs. Perinatologists with expertise in performing IUTs for other conditions can offer this therapy in close collaboration with pediatric hematologists. After birth, patients can be treated with chronic transfusions or stem cell transplant. Given immigration patterns from regions with a high carrier frequency, there is a growing population of families at risk for ATM in North America and beyond. Recognition of the specific needs for these patients is critical in delivering optimal care. In addition to clinical resources, connecting families within the α thalassemia community via patient advocacy groups will be valuable in helping with informed decision-making.

### How I treat non-transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia [^b3304551]. Blood (2023). Medium credibility.

Early detection of iron overload is important to facilitate early intervention, prevent further iron accumulation, and reverse previous iron deposition. The preferred noninvasive method for diagnosis and monitoring of iron overload in NTDT is using a liver MRI with R2 or T2✱ techniques. Because NTDT is prevalent in areas of the world where advanced MRI techniques may not be available, serum ferritin level is used as a marker of iron overload when LIC measurement is not possible. Spot serum ferritin measurement can underestimate the degree of iron overload in many patients with NTDT because the ratio of serum ferritin level to LIC is lower than that in TDT. However, the trends in serum ferritin levels over time remain informative and can be followed in the absence of access to a liver MRI. We typically start screening patients with NTDT for iron overload as of age 10 years. We perform a baseline MRI for LIC measurement and repeat it every 1 or 2 years in the absence of indications for ICT. For patients receiving ICT, we track the LIC via MRI every 6 or 12 months. In the context of NTDT, there is insufficient evidence to recommend routine screening with cardiac MRI T2✱.
