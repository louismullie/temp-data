## Question

can food cause a uti

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether food can cause a urinary tract infection (UTI). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core pathophysiology of UTIs and the usual bacterial reservoirs. Then, I should verify whether foodborne bacteria can serve as a source of uropathogens. Next, I will examine specific food–pathogen links, especially for extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC) and Staphylococcus saprophyticus. After that, I need to consider the strength of evidence and distinguish colonization from true infection. Finally, I will synthesize a cautious, clinically useful conclusion and outline practical implications for counseling and prevention.

> Let me first confirm the fundamentals: UTIs are typically caused by enteric bacteria ascending from the perineal and gastrointestinal reservoirs, with Escherichia coli responsible for roughly 80–90% of cases. This mechanistic anchor frames how we interpret any foodborne hypothesis, so I need to keep that in mind as I proceed [^111SBV8v].

> Wait, let me verify the foodborne angle before jumping ahead: multiple lines of evidence suggest that some extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC) strains causing human UTIs originate in food animals and can be transmitted to humans via the food supply, particularly poultry, indicating a plausible foodborne contribution to the uropathogen reservoir rather than direct "food poisoning" of the urinary tract per se [^113fuR5k] [^111SBV8v] [^1136k2rD].

> I will now examine specific pathogens and foods. Staphylococcus saprophyticus, a recognized uropathogen in young women, frequently colonizes livestock and contaminates meat and fermented foods, and contemporary genomic work supports speculation that food may seed human colonization and subsequent infection, though definitive attribution remains challenging and likely reflects colonization dynamics rather than ingestion-acute infection pathways [^115ozM5B].

> Hold on, let's not conflate colonization with infection. The more accurate clinical framing is that contaminated food can introduce uropathogens into the human gut, where they may transiently or persistently colonize, and from there ascend to cause UTI depending on host and behavioral risk factors, rather than food acting as a direct portal of entry into the urinary tract itself [^113KDEcE] [^113fuR5k].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought "foodborne UTIs" might be a direct, frequent route, but I should double-check the strength of evidence. While observational and molecular studies link retail meat ExPEC to human UTI isolates, causality is complex and confounded by processing and handling, so the prudent conclusion is that food can contribute to the uropathogen reservoir and thus indirectly influence UTI risk, rather than serving as a primary, direct cause in most cases [^1136k2rD] [^113fuR5k].

> Next, I should review practical implications. Safe food handling to reduce introduction of high-risk ExPEC into the gut makes sense, and for patients seeking nonantibiotic prevention, standardized cranberry products have moderate-quality evidence for reducing recurrent UTIs in some populations, though effects vary by formulation and patient group, so I need to counsel on realistic expectations and product selection if chosen [^114VsfN9] [^116scJSi] [^114DCdn9].

> Let me reconsider the bottom line to ensure I'm precise: food does not directly "cause" UTIs in the way contaminated food causes gastroenteritis, but foodborne uropathogens — especially certain E. coli lineages and possibly S. saprophyticus — can colonize the gut and thereby contribute to the reservoir from which UTIs arise. Therefore, food can be an indirect contributor to UTI risk, particularly via colonization and subsequent ascent, rather than a direct pathogenic portal into the urinary tract [^113KDEcE] [^113fuR5k] [^115ozM5B].

---

Food does not directly cause UTIs, but **contaminated food can introduce uropathogens** (notably E. coli) that colonize the gut and later ascend to the urinary tract [^113fuR5k] [^1136k2rD]. Poor food hygiene, undercooked meat, and raw produce increase this risk [^notfound]. Once colonized, **sexual activity, hygiene, or impaired immunity** can trigger infection [^116hJy6A] [^111MeHfU] [^112eGX1X]. Safe food handling and cooking reduce exposure; cranberry products may modestly lower recurrence risk but are not a substitute for antibiotics [^114VsfN9] [^116scJSi].

## Pathways linking food to UTIs

UTIs are typically caused by bacteria from the gastrointestinal tract — especially **E. coli** — ascending to the **urinary tract** [^111SBV8v]. Food can indirectly contribute by introducing these bacteria into the gut, where they may **colonize** and later ascend [^113fuR5k]. The main pathways include:

- **Contaminated food consumption**: Food contaminated with uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC) or other bacteria can colonize the gut, increasing UTI risk [^113fuR5k] [^1136k2rD].

- **Improper food handling**: Poor hygiene during preparation or consumption can introduce bacteria into the digestive tract, facilitating colonization and subsequent UTI [^1136k2rD].

- **Undercooked or raw foods**: Raw or undercooked meat, poultry, and seafood can harbor bacteria that, if ingested, may colonize the gut and later cause UTI [^notfound].

---

## Evidence linking specific foods to UTIs

Several studies have explored the connection between specific foods and UTIs:

| **Food category** | **Evidence linking to UTIs** | **Mechanism** |
|-|-|-|
| Contaminated meat (especially poultry) | Strong evidence linking E. coli from retail chicken to human UTIs [^111SBV8v] [^1136k2rD] | Consumption of contaminated meat introduces UPEC into the gut, leading to colonization and subsequent UTI [^113fuR5k] |
| Raw or undercooked foods | Documented cases of foodborne pathogens causing UTIs | Ingestion of pathogens that colonize the gut and ascend to the urinary tract [^113fuR5k] |
| Fermented foods (e.g. cheese, yogurt) | Potential link to UTIs due to presence of bacteria like Enterococcus faecalis [^notfound] | Consumption of foods containing uropathogenic bacteria may increase UTI risk |

---

## Role of foodborne bacteria in UTIs

Foodborne bacteria, particularly E. coli, are a significant cause of UTIs. Studies show that **retail chicken is a reservoir** for E. coli strains that cause human UTIs, indicating that consumption of contaminated poultry can directly contribute to UTI risk [^111SBV8v] [^1136k2rD]. Enterococcus faecalis from food-producing animals has also been linked to human UTIs, underscoring the zoonotic potential of foodborne pathogens [^114tUmGv].

---

## Preventive measures and dietary recommendations

To minimize the risk of UTIs associated with food consumption, the following preventive measures and dietary recommendations are advised:

- **Safe food handling**: Wash hands thoroughly before handling food, cook meat and poultry to safe internal temperatures, and avoid cross-contamination [^notfound].

- **Avoidance of high-risk foods**: Limit consumption of raw or undercooked meat, poultry, and seafood, especially if sourced from unreliable suppliers [^notfound].

- **Hydration**: Drink plenty of water to help flush bacteria from the urinary tract [^111kzGSH].

- **Cranberry products**: Cranberry juice or supplements may reduce UTI recurrence in some populations, although evidence is mixed and not a substitute for antibiotics [^114VsfN9] [^116scJSi].

---

## Conclusion

While food does not directly cause UTIs, **contaminated food can introduce uropathogenic bacteria** into the gastrointestinal tract, increasing the risk of colonization and subsequent infection [^115ozM5B]. Safe food handling, proper cooking, and dietary precautions can significantly reduce this risk [^notfound].

### Food reservoir for Escherichia coli causing urinary tract infections [^1136k2rD]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

The identification of 2 clonal groups containing isolates from retail chicken meat and human infections supports our a priori hypothesis. We cannot exclude the possibility that food source isolates were present because of human contamination during food production, processing or handling, even though it is very unlikely. Subsequent research will help determine whether these E. coli occur in a food animal reservoir or whether transfer of these E. coli results from contamination during food processing or preparation and reflects human-to-human transmission by food.

This study demonstrates that some E. coli from retail chicken meat and other food sources are closely related to E. coli causing human UTIs. Since a food animal reservoir apparently exists for E. coli that cause urinary tract and other extraintestinal infections, this further reinforces the need for responsible antimicrobial drug stewardship in veterinary medicine and food animal production as well as in human medicine.

### Standardised high dose versus low dose cranberry proanthocyanidin extracts for the prevention of recurrent urinary tract infection in healthy women [PACCANN]: a double blind randomised controlled trial protocol [^114dRj26]. BMC Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are one of the most common bacterial infections affecting women. UTI preferentially affects young, sexually active women with 50–60% of women reporting at least one UTI during their lifetime. Nearly 1 in 3 women will experience at least one episode of UTI requiring antibiotic therapy before the age of 24 years and a quarter of these women will present reoccurrence within 6 months. Anatomical differences in male and female perineal anatomy may explain why women are more susceptible than men to the ascension of faecal bacteria in the urinary tract. More precisely, these anatomical features include a relative shortness of the urethra, the urethral meatus's proximity to the anus and a more humid surrounding environment comparatively to the male anatomy. Additional well-established risk factors include spermicide-based contraception, history of previous UTI, first UTI before 15 years of age and those with UTI history in the mother.

Recurrent UTIs (r-UTI) are defined as more than 2 episodes in the last 6 months or 3 episodes in the last year. The major symptoms of UTI include dysuria, increased frequency of urine, cloudy urine and occasionally hematuria. In general, uncomplicated UTIs are confined to the bladder, resolve quickly following antibiotic treatment and thus are associated with fewer severe or long-term sequelae. Though viewed as a benign affliction, uncomplicated lower UTI symptoms can have considerable impacts on the patient's productivity and quality of life. A study of university women reported that patients suffering from UTI experienced 2.4 days of restricted activity, 1.2 days of lost time and 0.4 bed bound days due to their symptoms. Presently, the Canadian Urological Association and Society of Obstetricians and Gynecologists of Canada recommendations for the treatment of uncomplicated r-UTI use one of three antibiotic treatment regimens: continuous antibiotic prophylaxis, post-coital antibiotic prophylaxis or self-start antibiotic therapy. Empirical and preventive antibiotics for the treatment of r-UTI have been established as the most cost-effective way to manage these infections. However, prescribing without confirmation of diagnosis and isolation of causal bacterial contributes to the growing problem of uropathogen resistance in primary care.

### High dose versus low dose standardized cranberry proanthocyanidin extract for the prevention of recurrent urinary tract infection in healthy women: a double-blind randomized controlled trial [^117QEpR9]. BMC Urology (2021). Medium credibility.

Outcomes

The primary outcome was the number of symptomatic UTIs during the 24-week follow-up period. Symptomatic UTI was defined as acute urinary symptoms such as urine frequency, urgency, dysuria, pelvic pain, and hematuria in the absence of alternate diagnoses as assessed by study staff. The choice of symptomatic UTI was based on local and international guidelines as well as on realistic clinical settings in North America where empirical therapy is prescribed on the basis of clinical symptoms. This outcome increased our capture of UTI episodes and trial conduct as we anticipated that certain women would be unable to present themselves to the research facilities to provide a urine sample.

Secondary outcomes were symptomatic UTI with pyuria and symptomatic UTI with bacteriuria. Women who presented both symptoms and a positive leukocyte esterase dipstick result, were diagnosed as having symptomatic UTI with pyuria. Episodes were categorized as symptomatic UTI with bacteriuria in the presence of ≥ 10³ CFU/ml of uropathogenic bacteria. Women with antibiotic treatment for symptomatic UTI during the study period continued to take the cranberry capsules and remained in the study for 24 weeks.

Compliance and side effects

Participants completed a daily journal to record compliance and were asked to bring capsule bottles to each visit in order to count remaining capsules. A bi-weekly email reminder was sent to encourage participation. Side effects were evaluated at each visit and participants were asked to document symptoms in their daily journal.

Sample size and statistical analysis

We estimated that 35% of patients in the control group would present at least one UTI during the 24-week follow-up period. We needed to recruit 126 women to detect a clinically significant difference of 25% between the 2 groups (10% of women assigned to the experimental group would experience at least 1 UTI with a power of 80%). We estimated that 15% of randomized participants would be lost to follow-up, therefore 148 women needed to be recruited in order for at least 126 participants to complete the 24-week intervention.

The Poisson regression model was used to compare the incidence of symptomatic UTI during the 24-week follow-up. A Kaplan Meier estimate with a log-rank test was used to compare time to first UTI between the two treatment arms. Intention to treat analyses were performed in all randomly assigned subjects with the observation time censored at the date that the participant abandoned or the date of last contact (either a scheduled study visit or visit for UTI treatment). All statistical analyses were performed using SAS University Edition software (SAS Institute Inc. Cary, NC, USA).

### Cranberry products for the prophylaxis of urinary tract infections in pediatric patients [^1164T5a1]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the existing data regarding the use of cranberry products for the prevention of urinary tract infections (UTIs) in pediatric patients.

Data Sources

A literature search of Medline databases from 1966 to June 2015 was conducted.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

The databases were searched using the terms "pediatrics", "children", "cranberry", "cranberry juice", and "urinary tract infections". The identified trials were then searched for additional references applicable to this topic.

Data Synthesis

A total of 8 clinical trials were identified that examined the use of cranberry products, mostly juice, for the prevention of UTIs in children. Three trials examined the use in otherwise healthy children. Five trials examined the use in pediatric patients with underlying urogenital abnormalities of which 2 compared cranberry to antibiotics. In healthy pediatric patients, cranberry use was associated with a reduction in the overall number of UTIs and a decrease in the number of antibiotic days per year for UTI treatment. In patients with urogenital abnormalities, results were conflicting, with some studies showing no reduction in UTIs compared with placebo, but others demonstrating a significant reduction. However, cranberry products had similar efficacy when compared with both cefaclor and trimethoprim. All studies used a wide variety of doses and frequencies of cranberry, making specific product recommendations difficult.

Conclusions

Cranberry appears effective for the prevention of UTIs in otherwise healthy children and is at least as effective as antibiotics in children with underlying urogenital abnormalities. However, recommendations for cranberry dosing and frequency cannot be confidently made at this time. Larger, well-designed trials are recommended.

### FDA announces health claim for certain cranberry products and UTI… [^112J4WyC]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Constituent Update July 21, 2020 The U. S. Food and Drug Administration announced today in a letter of enforcement discretion that it does not intend to object to the use of certain qualified health claims regarding consuming certain cranberry products and a reduced risk of recurrent urinary tract infection in healthy women. Based on the FDA's review, the agency concluded that there is limited and inconsistent credible scientific evidence to support a qualified health claim for the consumption of cranberry juice beverages and limited credible scientific evidence to support a qualified health claim for the consumption of cranberry dietary supplements and a reduced risk of recurrent UTI in healthy women.

Specifically, the FDA intends to exercise its enforcement discretion regarding claims for the association between consumption of cranberry juice beverages containing at least 27 percent cranberry juice and cranberry dietary supplements containing at least 500 milligrams of cranberry fruit powder and a reduced risk of recurrent UTI. The claims do not include other conventional foods or food products made from or containing cranberries, such as dried cranberries or cranberry sauce. The following qualified health claims are included in the FDA's letter of enforcement discretion: For cranberry juice beverages
- "Limited and inconsistent scientific evidence shows that by consuming one serving each day of a cranberry juice beverage, healthy women who have had a urinary tract infection may reduce their risk of recurrent UTI.

"
- "Consuming one serving each day of a cranberry juice beverage may help reduce the risk of recurrent urinary tract infection in healthy women. FDA has concluded that the scientific evidence supporting this claim is limited and inconsistent".
- "Consuming one serving each day of may help reduce the risk of recurrent urinary tract infection in healthy women. FDA has concluded that the scientific evidence supporting this claim is limited and inconsistent. " For cranberry dietary supplements.
- "Limited scientific evidence shows that by consuming 500 mg each day of cranberry dietary supplement, healthy women who have had a urinary tract infection may reduce their risk of recurrent UTI. "
- "Consuming 500 mg each day of cranberry dietary supplement may help reduce the risk of recurrent urinary tract infection in healthy women.

FDA has concluded that there is limited scientific evidence supporting this claim".

### Preventing urinary tract infection in older people living in care homes: the 'StOP UTI' realist synthesis [^112ze7Sp]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2025). High credibility.

CMOc 7: proactive strategies are in place to prevent recurrent UTI (n = 7 articles)

In care homes where recurrent UTI (RUTI) is recognised as a treatable problem with systems to identify residents at risk (context), care staff are less accepting of the inevitability of RUTI and can consider options for its prevention (mechanism), ensuring residents are offered preventative treatment to reduce the risk of further UTI and the emergence of antimicrobial resistant infections (outcome).

Despite the treatment of RUTI being accepted practice, it is not commonly used in care home residents. Awareness among care staff of pharmacological strategies for preventing UTI is limited, although hydration and cranberry juice are perceived as important. There are also concerns that labelling residents as having RUTIs would encourage unnecessary antibiotic treatment.

The options for managing people with RUTI are complex and require evaluation of individual underlying risk factors to select the best approach. Stakeholders identified that systems to recognise residents with RUTI and trigger an assessment or treatment were deficient and staff were not aware of the availability and value of prophylactic treatment.

This CMOc was informed by national and international guidelinesand one comprehensive narrative review. We found only one small studyundertaken in a care home setting where a continence advisor developed individualised treatment plans for residents with RUTI with preventative strategies including topical oestrogen and increased fluid and fibre intake. The intervention was associated with an 80% reduction (31–6) in UTI highlighting the value of input from a continence advisor in preventing UTI.

### Randomised trial of cranberry-lingonberry juice and Lactobacillus GG drink for the prevention of urinary tract infections in women [^115P1PLC]. BMJ (2001). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To determine whether recurrences of urinary tract infection can be prevented with cranberry-lingonberry juice or with Lactobacillus GG drink.

Design

Open, randomised controlled 12 month follow up trial.

Setting

Health centres for university students and staff of university hospital.

Participants

150 women with urinary tract infection caused by Escherichia coli randomly allocated into three groups.

Interventions

50 mL of cranberry-lingonberry juice concentrate daily for six months or 100 mL of lactobacillus drink five days a week for one year, or no intervention.

Main Outcome Measure

First recurrence of symptomatic urinary tract infection, defined as bacterial growth ≥ 10⁵colony forming units/ml in a clean voided midstream urine specimen.

Results

The cumulative rate of first recurrence of urinary tract infection during the 12 month follow up differed significantly between the groups (P = 0.048). At six months, eight (16%) women in the cranberry group, 19 (39%) in the lactobacillus group, and 18 (36%) in the control group had had at least one recurrence. This is a 20% reduction in absolute risk in the cranberry group compared with the control group (95% confidence interval 3% to 36%, P = 0.023, number needed to treat = 5, 95% confidence interval 3 to 34).

Conclusion

Regular drinking of cranberry juice but not lactobacillus seems to reduce the recurrence of urinary tract infection.

### D-mannose for prevention of recurrent urinary tract infection among women: a randomized clinical trial [^112F6EEx]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Implications

-Mannose is a relatively expensive food supplement that is sold directly to the public in the US and UK. It should not be used to prevent rUTI in a primary care setting. However, the present results are not necessarily generalizable to secondary care populations who may be more severely affected. There has recently been interest in other approaches to block the binding of the Escherichia coli type 1 pili. Synthetic mannosides, which have a much higher affinity for the FimH adhesin, have shown promise in mouse models. A phase 1 trial of a vaccine against the FimH adhesin recently demonstrated safety and immunogenicity.

Strengths and Limitations

Strengths of this study include the placebo-controlled design, the sample drawn from a diverse primary care with a population representative of the intended-use population, and 97.5% ascertainment of the primary outcome. Limitations include possible underdosing, although the dose was the same as in 2 previous trials that found benefit. Although the patient advisory panel favored a powder over capsule form, it is possible that capsules might have resulted in a more consistent dose per day. The primary outcome was a pragmatic one of clinically suspected UTI following ambulatory care attendance, chosen with the patient advisory panel as the most important indicator of symptom burden, and we did not seek microbiological confirmation for all recurrence episodes. However, urine cultures were performed at more than 60% of the clinical contacts for suspected UTI, and the proportion of women experiencing at least 1 microbiologically confirmed UTI was similar in both groups. Although more than two-thirds of women reported taking the study product at least 3 days a week for 15 weeks, adherence could have affected the validity of findings. The per protocol analyses including only those women reporting good adherence found similar effects, and adherence was similar in the 2 arms. Finally, a small number of participants experienced outlying durations of symptoms and used antibiotics often, which could have skewed the results. We used post hoc analyses to interrogate the effect of this on findings, which did not meaningfully alter our estimates.

### Medical treatment for urinary tract infections [^113wS4eQ]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a common source of morbidity and require significant health care resources for diagnosis, treatment, and prevention. Antimicrobials represent the mainstay for the treatment of UTIs. Established guidelines exist for the antimicrobial treatment and prevention of uncomplicated UTIs; however, antimicrobial dependence and overuse have led to the emergence of antimicrobial resistance. Nonantimicrobial alternatives are an ongoing area of research and should be considered when clinically appropriate based on available evidence.

### Effectiveness of cranberry capsules to prevent urinary tract infections in vulnerable older persons: a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial in long-term care facilities [^114TVw1X]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2014). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a common bacterial infection in residents of long-term care facilities (LTCF), accounting for nearly 25% of all infections.UTI not only causes several days of illness, but may have more-severe consequences such as delirium, dehydration, urosepsis, hospitalization, or even death.

Interventions to prevent UTI could reduce these severe consequences, but there are no evidence-based interventions that decrease UTI in institutionalized populations. The use of prophylactic antibiotics is currently controversial because of side-effects and antibiotic resistance. Prophylaxis with cranberry is a potential prevention strategy. Cranberries contain proanthocyanidins (PACs), which are stable phenolic compounds with anti-adhesion activity against Escherichia coli.–In vitro, antibacterial activity of concentrated cranberry juice against other pathogens such Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis has also been demonstrated.

There is aggregated evidence that cranberry juice may lead to a decrease in the incidence of symptomatic UTIs over a 12-month period, particularly in women with recurrent UTIs. Another recent systematic review indicates that cranberry-containing products are associated with a protective effect against UTI in different subgroups, albeit with heterogeneity across the included trials. A recent study in children without urological abnormalities showed a 65% reduction of UTI with the use of cranberry.

Two studies reported that cranberry juice may be protective in subgroups of older adults, but the effectiveness of cranberry capsules in the protection against UTI in vulnerable older persons in LTCFs has not been studied.

The present study assessed the effectiveness of cranberry capsules in preventing UTI in vulnerable older persons living in LTCFs. Research in an institutionalized population is challenging, and clinical manifestations of UTI may be subtle.–To be relevant for clinical practice and science, a clinical definition according to international guidelines for LTCF residents and a strict definition according to scientific criteria were both used.

### Overview on cranberry and urinary tract infections in females [^115isbyo]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2010). Low credibility.

Cranberry (Vaccinium macrocarpon) has been used for decades to prevent urinary tract infections (UTIs) that are among the most common bacterial infections in women. As to the traditional use of cranberry and its A-type proanthocyanidins' ability to inhibit adherence of the bacterial P fimbriae in a dose-dependent manner, clinical trials have been conducted on different subpopulations. A Cochrane meta-analysis in 244 females with symptomatic UTI suggests that the effect was more pronounced in women with recurrent UTIs than elderly males and females or people requiring catheterization. A first head-to-head trial in older females has been published comparing effectiveness of a low-dose antibiotic versus cranberry in which investigators suggest that cranberry products may have a role in older females with recurrent UTI. Still with regard to antibiotic treatment in women, a recently published study investigated also the potential cranberry juice interaction with beta-lactam antibiotics supporting the hypothesis that cranberry juice in usual quantities as prophylaxis for UTI is not likely to alter the pharmacokinetics of these oral antibiotics. In addition, the effects of cranberry in pregnant female patients have been investigated. A first pilot trial has been published in which, while a possible protective effect was shown, more than one third of the females withdrew mainly for gastrointestinal upset.

### Does ingestion of cranberry juice reduce symptomatic urinary tract infections in older people in hospital? A double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^115cJZxK]. Age and Ageing (2005). Low credibility.

Background

cranberry juice is often given to older people in hospital to prevent urinary tract infection (UTI), although there is little evidence to support its use.

Objective

to assess whether cranberry juice ingestion is effective in reducing UTIs in older people in hospital.

Design

randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial.

Setting

Medicine for the Elderly assessment and rehabilitation hospital wards.

Subjects

376 older patients in hospital.

Methods

participants were randomised to daily ingestion of 300 mL of cranberry juice or matching placebo beverage. The primary outcome was time to onset of first UTI. Secondary outcomes were adherence to beverage drinking, courses of antibiotics prescribed, and organisms responsible for UTIs.

Results

a total of 21/376 (5.6%) participants developed a symptomatic UTI: 14/189 in the placebo group and 7/187 in the cranberry juice group. These between-group differences were not significant, relative risk (RR) 0.51 [95% CI 0.21–1.22, P = 0.122). Although there were significantly fewer infections with Escherichia coli in the cranberry group (13 versus 4) RR 0.31 [95% CI 0.10–0.94, P = 0.027], this should be interpreted with caution as it was a secondary outcome.

Conclusion

despite having the largest sample size of any clinical trial yet to have examined the effect of cranberry juice ingestion, the actual infection rate observed was lower than anticipated, making the study underpowered. This study has confirmed the acceptability of cranberry juice to older people. Larger trials are now required to determine whether it is effective in reducing UTIs in older hospital patients.

### Cranberry juice for the prevention of recurrences of urinary tract infections in children: a randomized placebo-controlled trial [^113BknWR]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Cranberry juice prevents recurrences of urinary tract infections (UTIs) in adult women. The objective of this study was to evaluate whether cranberry juice is effective in preventing UTI recurrences in children.

Methods

A double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial was performed in 7 hospitals in Finland. A total of 263 children treated for UTI were randomized to receive either cranberry juice (n = 129) or placebo (n = 134) for 6 months. Eight children were omitted because of protocol violations, leaving 255 children for the final analyses. The children were monitored for 1 year, and their recurrent UTIs were recorded.

Results

Twenty children (16%) in the cranberry group and 28 (22%) in the placebo group had at least 1 recurrent UTI (difference, -6%; 95% confidence interval [CI] -16 to 4%; p = 0.21). There were no differences in timing between these first recurrences (P = 0.32). Episodes of UTI totaled 27 and 47 in the cranberry and placebo groups, respectively, and the UTI incidence density per person-year at risk was 0.16 episodes lower in the cranberry group (95% CI, -.31 to -.01; p = 0.035). The children in the cranberry group had significantly fewer days on antimicrobials (-6 days per patient-year; 95% CI, -7 to -5; P < .001).

Conclusions

The intervention did not significantly reduce the number of children who experienced a recurrence of UTI, but it was effective in reducing the actual number of recurrences and related antimicrobial use.

### Novel approaches to prevention of urinary tract infections [^113YqaxQ]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections are common clinical entities occurring in a variety of patient groups, most frequently caused by uropathogenic E. coli. Novel methods of preventing UTI currently under development are focused on three key approaches: (1) use of cranberry products, (2) restoration of the normal flora using Lactobacillus-based probiotic preparations, and (3) vaccine development. Although promising studies in each of these areas have been published or are ongoing, additional properly designed and powered clinical studies based on solid scientific evidence are needed.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^111QtwvM]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Recurrent urinary tract infection prophylaxis — additional 2022 studies of cranberry often showed no difference, with very low strength of evidence. Four additional studies addressed cranberry prophylaxis, including combinations with other non-antibiotic agents and a dose comparison that did not show differences in UTI recurrences or adverse events; a cranberry + D‑mannose + Lactobacillus trial also did not show differences versus no treatment. A fourth study of high-dose cranberry combined with Lactobacillus and vitamin A reported fewer recurrences with treatment (9.1% versus 33.3%; p = 0.0053), but this did not impact the Guideline statement because it combined cranberry with two other substances.

### Diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of catheter-associated urinary tract infection in adults: 2009 international clinical practice guidelines from the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^113gUmBk]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2010). Medium credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for catheter-associated urinary tract infection, more specifically with respect to cranberry products, IDSA 2010 guidelines recommend to do not use cranberry products routinely to reduce CA-ASB or CA-UTI in patients with neurogenic bladder managed with intermittent or indwelling catheterization.
Insufficient evidence to support the use of cranberry products to reduce CA-ASB or CA-UTI in other groups of catheterized patients, including patients using condom catheters.

### Prevention of catheter-associated urinary tract infection [^112mk2R6]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The underlying cause of catheter-associated urinary tract infection is biofilm formation by uropathogens on the urinary catheter. Biofilm is a relatively new concept in medicine, and current measures to prevent biofilm formation are inadequate. Considerable work is being done in this area, but little clinical progress has been made. The purpose of this review is to analyze recent publications concerning prevention of catheter-associated urinary tract infection.

Recent Findings

Several recent studies have elucidated aspects of biofilm formation in catheter-associated urinary tract infection. Other researchers are working on methods to disrupt biofilm formation on catheter surfaces. At the same time, the magnitude of the problem of catheter-associated urinary tract infection has increased awareness of the effectiveness of basic infection control measures. A modern approach to infection control may include computerized ordering systems that minimize unnecessary days of catheterization. Finally, consumption of cranberry juice products and bacterial interference are two novel approaches to urinary tract infection prevention.

Summary

Biofilm-disrupting strategies offer promise for the future but have little immediate applicability. Implementation of infection control measures to improve catheter function and remove unnecessary catheters can be done at the present time. In general, prevention of catheter-associated urinary tract infection remains an elusive goal. More basic research at the level of pathogenesis is needed so that novel strategies can be designed.

Introduction

Globally, urinary tract infections (UTIs) are among the most common bacterial infections in clinical practice, resulting in substantial clinical and economic burdens. Females are more susceptible, with nearly 1 in 3 females having at least one episode of UTI requiring antimicrobial therapy by the age of 24 y, ∼50 to 70% experiencing a UTI during their lifetime, and ∼20 to 40% of those who have had a UTI will have recurrent UTI (rUTI). UTIs are associated with pain and discomfort, which can cause stress and affect a patient's quality of life. The most common form of UTI is cystitis, an acute uncomplicated infection confined to the bladder. Cystitis remains one of the most common conditions requiring antimicrobial treatment, which is also highly effective as a prophylactic measure. However, continued use is often associated with antimicrobial resistance. The impact on antimicrobial resistance rates and subsequent health care and economic burden is of major concern such that establishing alternative safe and effective nonantibiotic therapies for prevention of rUTI in otherwise healthy females should be prioritized. Cranberry (Vaccinium macrocarpon) products have been suggested as an alternative therapeutic strategy. Components in the cranberry fruit, including proanthocyanidins and flavonoids, have been shown in both in vitro and ex vivo experiments to induce antiadhesive activity against uropathogenic Escherichia coli to uroepithelial cells, resulting in impaired colonization and reduced subsequent infection. The most recent Cochrane review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials that evaluated the effects of various cranberry-containing products on risk of UTIs in susceptible populations reported reduced risk of symptomatic, culture-confirmed UTIs in females with rUTIs with moderate certainty (8 studies, 1555 participants: relative risk [RR]: 0.74; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.55, 0.99; I² = 54%). While, most clinical trials to date have tested fractions from cranberry fruit, such as juice concentrate or isolated proanthocyanidins, two clinical studies investigated a powder consisting of whole cranberry fruit. Although they both described reduced incidence of UTI in females with rUTI, the trials presented methodological and statistical limitations. The study by Sengupta et al. was short (90 d), small (n = 60 across 3 groups), treatments were not blinded, the primary outcome (presence of urinary Escherichia coli) was only assessed at visits and not as infections occurred, and unequal positive cultures were observed between groups at baseline. The study by Vostalova et al. although generally well designed, was criticized by the European Food Safety Authority for not including a proper intention-to-treat analysis. Therefore, high quality randomized controlled trials to assess the efficacy and safety of whole cranberry fruit powder to reduce incidence of UTIs in females with rUTIs are warranted.

The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2025). Medium credibility.

The primary aim of the current study was to investigate the effectiveness of a whole cranberry fruit powder on the incidence of culture-confirmed UTI in females with a history of rUTI (≥ 3 UTIs in the last year or ≤ 2 UTIs in the last 6 mo, but not > 5 UTIs), over a 6-mo intervention period. Secondary outcomes included incidence of symptomatic suspected UTI, incidence of individual symptoms of culture-confirmed UTI (dysuria, urinary frequency or urgency, fever, suprapubic pain, and macroscopic hematuria), time to first culture-confirmed UTI episode, number of culture-confirmed UTIs per participant and presence of individual uropathogenic species on culture at any time of a culture-confirmed UTI and safety assessments. Sexual health was investigated as an exploratory outcome in a subset of sexually active and consenting females.

### Cranberries for preventing urinary tract infections [^114VsfN9]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Cranberries contain proanthocyanidins (PACs), which inhibit the adherence of p-fimbriated Escherichia coli to the urothelial cells lining the bladder. Cranberry products have been used widely for several decades to prevent urinary tract infections (UTIs). This is the fifth update of a review first published in 1998 and updated in 2003, 2004, 2008, and 2012.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of cranberry products in preventing UTIs in susceptible populations.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Specialised Register up to 13 March 2023 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs of cranberry products compared with placebo, no specific treatment or other intervention (antibiotics, probiotics) for the prevention of UTIs were included.

Data Collection and Analysis

At least two authors independently assessed and extracted data. Information was collected on methods, participants, interventions and outcomes (incidence of symptomatic UTIs, positive culture results, side effects, adherence to therapy). Risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated where appropriate. Study quality was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias assessment tool. Confidence in the evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.

Main Results

For this update, 26 new studies were added, bringing the total number of included studies to 50 (8857 randomised participants). The risk of bias for sequence generation and allocation concealment was low for 29 and 28 studies, respectively. Thirty-six studies were at low risk of performance bias, and 23 studies were at low risk of detection bias. Twenty-seven, 41, and 17 studies were at low risk of attrition bias, reporting bias and other bias, respectively. Forty-five studies compared cranberry products with placebo, water or no specific treatment in six different groups of participants. Twenty-six of these 45 studies could be meta-analysed for the outcome of symptomatic, culture-verified UTIs. In moderate certainty evidence, cranberry products reduced the risk of UTIs (6211 participants: RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.84; I² = 69%). When studies were divided into groups according to the treatment indication, cranberry products probably reduced the risk of symptomatic, culture-verified UTIs in women with recurrent UTIs (8 studies, 1555 participants: RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.99; I² = 54%), in children (5 studies, 504 participants: RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.68; I² = 21%) and in people with a susceptibility to UTIs due to an intervention (6 studies, 1434 participants: RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.61; I² = 0%). However, there may be little or no benefit in elderly institutionalised men and women (3 studies, 1489 participants: RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.30; I² = 9%; moderate certainty evidence), pregnant women (3 studies, 765 participants: RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.50; I² = 3%; moderate certainty evidence), or adults with neuromuscular bladder dysfunction with incomplete bladder emptying (3 studies, 464 participants: RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.19; I² = 0%; low certainty evidence). Other comparisons were cranberry products with probiotics (three studies) or antibiotics (six studies), cranberry tablets with cranberry liquid (one study), and different doses of PACs (two studies). Compared to antibiotics, cranberry products may make little or no difference to the risk of symptomatic, culture-verified UTIs (2 studies, 385 participants: RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.33; I² = 0%) or the risk of clinical symptoms without culture (2 studies, 336 participants: RR 1.30, 95% CI 0.79 to 2.14; I² = 68%). Compared to probiotics, cranberry products may reduce the risk of symptomatic, culture-verified UTIs (3 studies, 215 participants: RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.56; I² = 0%). It is unclear whether efficacy differs between cranberry juice and tablets or between different doses of PACs, as the certainty of the evidence was very low. The number of participants with gastrointestinal side effects probably does not differ between those taking cranberry products and those receiving a placebo or no specific treatment (10 studies, 2166 participants: RR 1.33, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.77; I² = 0%; moderate certainty evidence). There was no clear relationship between compliance with therapy and the risk for repeat UTIs. No difference in the risk for UTIs could be demonstrated between low, moderate and high doses of PACs.

Authors' Conclusions

This update adds a further 26 studies, taking the total number of studies to 50 with 8857 participants. These data support the use of cranberry products to reduce the risk of symptomatic, culture-verified UTIs in women with recurrent UTIs, in children, and in people susceptible to UTIs following interventions. The evidence currently available does not support its use in the elderly, patients with bladder emptying problems, or pregnant women.

### Urinary tract infection pathogenesis: host factors [^113tCV6p]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Clinically, host factors in the pathogenesis of urinary tract infection (UTI) may be considered as modifiable (eg, behaviors associated with increased risk of UTI, anatomic and functional problems of the urinary tract) and thus potentially amenable to a change in patient behavior or treatment approach, or as intrinsic and nonmodifiable host factors that neither the patient nor the clinician can influence (eg, gender and genetic influences associated with UTI). Although considering nonmodifiable host factors may be discouraging to patients and clinicians at present, some genetic associations have the potential for future predictive value and may interface with future treatments.

### D-mannose for prevention of recurrent urinary tract infection among women: a randomized clinical trial [^115Uk7Pd]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is the most common bacterial infection affecting women presenting to primary care, with a lifetime risk of up to 50%. Recurrent UTI (rUTI), defined as experiencing 2 UTIs in 6 months or 3 in a year, has a considerable negative effect on quality of life, which extends beyond the unpleasant symptoms to distressing and disrupted sexual relationships, persistent and unmanageable pain, and systemic illness. In 2019, more than 400 million individuals had UTIs globally, and more than 200 000 people died of UTIs.

The most common approach to prophylaxis of rUTI is daily antibiotic use. While effective during the period of prophylaxis, this increases risk of subsequent resistant UTIs and adverse effects. A recent open randomized trial in women who were referred to secondary care with rUTI found that methenamine hippurate was noninferior to prophylactic antibiotics, but there is limited evidence in primary care populations of effectiveness in comparison with placebo, and there are limited data on effectiveness or safety in older adults.

-Mannose is a food supplement found in small quantities in some fruits and vegetablesthat may offer an alternative to antibiotic prophylaxis in women who experience rUTI and, in turn, contribute to better antimicrobial stewardship in primary care. It is absorbed in the upper gastrointestinal tract and excreted in the urine.-Mannose is a monosaccharide isomer of glucose that may inhibit bacterial adherence to uroepithelial cells by binding to a site on the tip of the fimbriaand has shown benefit in animal models in preventing UTIs. Although a recent Cochrane systematic review concluded that there was insufficient evidence to support-mannose for UTI prophylaxis, an open randomized trial that compared-mannose, antibiotic prophylaxis, and usual care found evidence of benefit. The high costs (at least £23 a month in the UK [US $29]) add weight to the need to establish whether family physicians should advise patients to buy-mannose, since it is not available on prescription. In this randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study, we compared the clinical effectiveness of-mannose and placebo powder to prevent UTI in women with rUTI in primary care.

### Cranberry juice and urinary tract infection [^113fcrBK]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Cranberries have long been the focus of interest for their beneficial effects in preventing urinary tract infections (UTIs). Cranberries contain 2 compounds with antiadherence properties that prevent fimbriated Escherichia coli from adhering to uroepithelial cells in the urinary tract. Approximately 1 dozen clinical trials have been performed testing the effects of cranberries on the urinary tract. However, these trials suffer from a number of limitations. Most importantly, the trials have used a wide variety of cranberry products, such as cranberry juice concentrate, cranberry juice cocktail, and cranberry capsules, and they have used different dosing regimens. Further research is required to clarify unanswered questions regarding the role of cranberries in protecting against UTI in general and in women with anatomical abnormalities in particular.

### Cysticlean® a highly pac standardized content in the prevention of recurrent urinary tract infections: an observational, prospective cohort study [^112PpsAS]. BMC Urology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The high prevalence of urinary tract infections (UTIs) causes a major social and health impact. 37% of women suffer at least one episode of cystitis during their lifetime, of these, 20% recur in the first two months due to poor cure of infection, resistance to antibiotics or poor hygiene habits. In addition, 12% have recurrent cystitis, that is, they suffer more than 2 episodes of cystitis in a year.

Cystitis affects predominantly women aged between 20 and 60 years. The most common causes include: alteration of the vaginal flora, cold and humidity, low insertion of the urethral meatus, chronic constipation, lack of lubrication and frequency of sexual intercourse, urinary retention and misuse of antibiotics.

To deal with this situation, different therapeutic options have been proposed. After establishing a presumptive diagnosis of UTI, antibiotic therapy is instituted until the result of the antibiotic susceptibility testing of the urinary culture is obtained. When infections are recurrent, the possibility of administering antibiotic prophylaxis temporarily can be considered, though given the gradual increase in the number of antibiotic resistances of the most common pathogens, the current trend is to search for other options.

Cysticlean® (Vaccinium macrocarpon) (hereinafter named Cys) is a dietary food supplement based on concentrated American cranberry (AC) extract. AC is known for its antibacterial properties and benefits on health of the urinary tract due to its high content in proantocyanidins (PAC) and, to a lesser extent, quinic acid. There is not a standard method (European Pharmacopeia) to measure PAC contents on AC, and this is the reason AC preparations with similar PAC content do not have the same antiadhesive effect against Escherichia coli. Cys is the AC extract marketed in Spain with greater antiadhesive capacity against E. coli (83% and 76% in the sachet and capsule forms, respectively), the main cause of UTIs.

The use of concentrated AC extract has no reported contraindications or side effects. It is thus ideal as a long-term treatment to prevent cystitis recurrences. Very rare cases of interaction with warfarin have been reported, but all were associated with massive intake of AC juice for several days.

Based on the above, this pilot study was conducted to determine the prophylactic efficacy of AC extract (Cys) in women with recurrent symptomatic postcoital urinary tract infections (PCUTIs) and its impact on their quality of life.

### High dose versus low dose standardized cranberry proanthocyanidin extract for the prevention of recurrent urinary tract infection in healthy women: a double-blind randomized controlled trial [^1176ZvmU]. BMC Urology (2021). Medium credibility.

In women experiencing higher level of UTI (> 5), certain factors that were not measured in our study could explain the mitigated response to PAC intake. It is possible that in these women, UTI recurrence may be the result of complex interactions between bacterial urovirulence and a particular host susceptibility (altered gut microbiota, less efficient adaptive immune response). Considering that PACs are poorly absorbed and are difficult to quantify in the urine, future studies should focus on the effect of these molecules on the gut microbiota, a natural reservoir for uropathogenic Escherichia coli. Gut microbiota composition and function largely vary between individuals which might explain differences in individual's susceptibility to UTI. This could be mediated by a direct effect (e.g. growth inhibition of pathobiont, encroachment of uropathogenic bacteria in the gut) or an indirect effect (microbial metabolism of PAC or potential bioactive urinary metabolites). In order to provide mechanistic insight explaining different levels of recurrence, feces and urine samples are being analysed and results will be published in a future article.

Our study was based on medical practice in Quebec whereby many women receive antibiotics without delaying treatment for several days while awaiting urine culture results. Similarly, Maki et al. compared daily intake of 41 mg PACs from cranberry juice cocktail compared to a placebo beverage on the incidence of symptomatic UTI during a 24-week follow-up. In our study, pyuria was present in 81% and bacteriuria was confirmed in 49% of the urine samples provided by participants during symptomatic UTI. This corresponds to the similar proportion of 80% of symptomatic UTI with pyuria and 60% with bacteriuria in a total of 106 symptomatic UTI episodes presented by Maki et al.

This study had limitations that could influence our findings. The use of a control dose instead of placebo may explain why we were unable to find a significant reduction in the recurrence of UTI in our cohort with a high UTI burden. A study conducted by Vostavola et al. has shown that 2.8 mg PAC daily can significantly impact the incidence of recurrent UTIs compared to placebo. Moreover, urine cultures were incomplete for a proportion of urine samples provided by symptomatic participants. Urine culture contaminated by improper clean-catch urine technique were excluded from analyses in order to mitigate a risk of detection bias. We also experienced technical issues such as delays in delivery to the microbiology laboratory and improperly stored samples.

### Can cranberries contribute to reduce the incidence of urinary tract infections? A systematic review with meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis of clinical trials [^1141Ze32]. The Journal of Urology (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

We sought to clarify the association between cranberry intake and the prevention of urinary tract infections.

Materials and Methods

This systematic review, which complies with the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis) statement, was done as a meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis of clinical trials.

Results

The findings clearly showed the potential use of cranberries for the clinical condition of urinary tract infection. Cranberry products significantly reduced the incidence of urinary tract infections as indicated by the weighted risk ratio (0.6750, 95% CI 0.5516–0.7965, p < 0.0001). The results of subgroup analysis demonstrated that patients at some risk for urinary tract infections were more susceptible to the effects of cranberry ingestion.

Conclusions

The results of the current study could be used by physicians to recommend cranberry ingestion to decrease the incidence of urinary tract infections, particularly in individuals with recurrent urinary tract infections. This would also reduce the administration of antibiotics, which could be beneficial since antibiotics can lead to the worldwide emergence of antibiotic resistant microorganisms.

### High dose versus low dose standardized cranberry proanthocyanidin extract for the prevention of recurrent urinary tract infection in healthy women: a double-blind randomized controlled trial [^1147HNUw]. BMC Urology (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Our objective was to assess the efficacy of a high dose cranberry proanthocyanidin extract for the prevention of recurrent urinary tract infection.

Material and methods

We recruited 145 healthy, adult women with a history of recurrent urinary tract infection, defined as ≥ 2 in the past 6 months or ≥ 3 in the past 12 months in this randomized, controlled, double-blind clinical trial. Participants were randomized to receive a high dose of standardized, commercially available cranberry proanthocyanidins (2 × 18.5 mg daily, n = 72) or a control low dose (2 × 1 mg daily, n = 73) for a 24-week period. During follow-up, symptomatic women provided urine samples for detection of pyuria and/or bacteriuria and received an appropriate antibiotic prescription. The primary outcome for the trial was the mean number of new symptomatic urinary tract infections during a 24-week intervention period. Secondary outcomes included symptomatic urinary tract infection with pyuria or bacteriuria.

Results

In response to the intervention, a non-significant 24% decrease in the number of symptomatic urinary tract infections was observed between groups (Incidence rate ratio 0.76, 95%CI 0.51–1.11). Post-hoc analyses indicated that among 97 women who experienced less than 5 infections in the year preceding enrolment, the high dose was associated with a significant decrease in the number of symptomatic urinary tract infections reported compared to the low dose (age-adjusted incidence rate ratio 0.57, 95%CI 0.33–0.99). No major side effects were reported.

Conclusion

High dose twice daily proanthocyanidin extract was not associated with a reduction in the number of symptomatic urinary tract infections when compared to a low dose proanthocyanidin extract. Our post-hoc results reveal that this high dose of proanthocyanidins may have a preventive impact on symptomatic urinary tract infection recurrence in women who experienced less than 5 infections per year.

### Enterococcus faecalis urinary-tract infections: Do they have a zoonotic origin? [^114tUmGv]. The Journal of Infection (2016). Low credibility.

Major human pathogens are frequently isolated from meat-producing animals, particularly poultry. Among them is Enterococcus faecalis, which is known to be one of the main cause of human urinary-tract infections worldwide. Early in 2015, we detected several, consecutive abnormal increases in the weekly number of human E. faecalis infections in various medical settings in the Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur region of France, especially including community-acquired urinary-tract infections. Speculating that this region-wide epidemiological event may have originated from animal-based food, we initiated this work to provide an overview of the epidemiology of E. faecalis, with a particular focus on the possible link between E. faecalis clones isolated from food-producing animals and those responsible for human urinary-tract infections. At that time, only one study had clearly identified strong epidemiological links between E. faecalis clones isolated from food-producing animals and human E. faecalis urinary-tract infections. This observation, coupled with our region-wide epidemiological experience, leads us to strongly believe that E. faecalis is a real zoonotic pathogen with potentially highly significant impact on human health. This is of particular concern because of its ability to acquire antibiotic-resistance genes and to infect animals and humans. Various strategies must be urgently implemented to address this public health threat, in particular through the development and implementation of large integrated automated surveillance systems based on animal and human health data to enable us to detect E. faecalis epidemiological events.

### Standardised high dose versus low dose cranberry proanthocyanidin extracts for the prevention of recurrent urinary tract infection in healthy women [PACCANN]: a double blind randomised controlled trial protocol [^115rALML]. BMC Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Implications of findings

Many Canadian women who present r-UTI commonly use over the counter cranberries-derived products with inadequate labelling of PACs concentrations. For cranberry products with quantification of PACs, these concentrations rarely exceed 2 mg in Canada. Various trials have tested the effectiveness of cranberry derived products, essentially in juice form, and their results remain discordant mainly due to the lack of standardization and low doses of PACs in tested products. Hence, the intrinsic activity of cranberry PACs, demonstrated against Escherichia coli in vitro, has never been optimized for the prevention of UTI. The results generated from this trial will clarify the role of cranberry extracts standardized in PACs on the decreased incidence of UTI in women presenting r-UTIs, will evaluate the differences in the incidence of UTI on the basis of different PACs concentrations and will respond to the recommendations reported in the last Cochrane meta-analysis.

This report provides comprehensive methods for a clinical trial on the prevention of RUTI by cranberry extract capsule intake. The strengths of this trial include the quantification and standardisation of PACs contained in the cranberry extract capsule and a randomized, double blind, controlled trial method. Our trial will add to a growing body of literature regarding cranberry extract capsule for the prevention of r-UTI in healthy women. In addition, the data set and specimen bank generated from conducting this trial will enable researchers to understand the metabolites of type-A PACs produced after prolonged consumption of cranberry capsules.

### Dietary factors protecting women from urinary tract infection [^116hJy6A]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Because urinary tract infections (UTIs) are caused by bacteria in the stool, dietary factors may affect the risk of contracting a UTI by altering the properties of the fecal bacterial flora.

Objective

We studied dietary and other risk factors for UTI in fertile women in a case-control setting.

Design

One hundred thirty-nine women from a health center for university students or from the staff of a university hospital (mean age: 30.5 y) with a diagnosis of an acute UTI were compared with 185 age-matched women with no episodes of UTIs during the past 5 y. Data on the women's dietary and other lifestyle habits were collected by questionnaire. A risk profile for UTI expressed in the form of adjusted odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs was modeled in logistic regression analysis for 107 case-control pairs with all relevant information.

Results

Frequent consumption of fresh juices, especially berry juices, and fermented milk products containing probiotic bacteria was associated with a decreased risk of recurrence of UTI: the OR for UTI was 0.66 (95% CI: 0.48, 0.92) per 2 dL juice. A preference for berry juice over other juices gave an OR of 0.28 (95% CI: 0.14, 0.56). Consumption of fermented milk products ≥ 3 times/wk gave an OR of 0.21 (95% CI: 0.06, 0.66) relative to consumption < 1 time/wk. Intercourse frequency was associated with an increased risk of UTI (OR for ≥ 3 times/wk compared with < 1 time/wk: 2.7; 95% CI: 1.16, 6.2).

Conclusion

Dietary habits seem to be an important risk factor for UTI recurrence in fertile women, and dietary guidance could be a first step toward prevention.

### Urinary tract infection: clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of the initial UTI in febrile infants and children 2 to 24 months [^116Qcf5R]. Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

American Academy of Pediatrics urinary tract infection guideline — antimicrobial prophylaxis considerations state that although effectiveness for prevention of UTI has not been demonstrated, the concept has biological plausibility. Antimicrobials reach high urinary concentrations, yet barriers include adherence to a daily regimen, adverse effects, and emergence of antimicrobial resistance. Evidence of effectiveness with a well-tolerated, safe product and parent education are needed; a urinary antiseptic that could be taken indefinitely without resistance is particularly desirable, and probiotics are another possible strategy.

### Standardised high dose versus low dose cranberry proanthocyanidin extracts for the prevention of recurrent urinary tract infection in healthy women [PACCANN]: a double blind randomised controlled trial protocol [^112d6PDX]. BMC Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Cranberries have been used for numerous years to prevent UTIs. Research suggests that proanthocyanidins (PACs), a component of cranberries, inhibit the adherence of p-fimbriated Escherichia coli on uroepithelial cells of the bladder, preventing the adherence of bacteria to the mucosal surface of the urinary tract and thereby inhibiting bacterial proliferation. A multicentre randomized clinical trial (RCT) in sexually active adult women showed that a daily dose of 36 mg PACs or more provided an optimal antibacterial effect in the urine. A Cochrane systematic review published in 2012, could not definitively conclude on the efficacy of cranberry products for the prevention of r-UTI mainly because of a lack of observance to the intake of cranberry supplements in juice form and also because of varying PACs concentrations in the different clinical trials that were rarely quantified or standardized. A systematic review in 2013 including trials conducted in women with r-UTI found a significantly decreased risk of UTI among women receiving cranberry-containing products compared to control (2 trials, Risk ratio (RR) = 0.53, 95%CI 0.33–0.83, I² = 0%).

Since these reviews, several well-designed trials have evaluated the effects of daily cranberry capsules in women with r-UTI. Most notably, an RCT compared the preventive effects of a cranberry juice (UR65) containing 40 mg PACs versus placebo on the relapse of UTI in women aged 20–79 years presenting acute complicated or uncomplicated cystitis with a history of r-UTI during a six-month follow-up The authors found no significant difference in the relapse rates of UTI between groups (log-rank test, p = 0.4209). Similarly, a double blind RCT evaluated the effects of a daily dose of 500 mg of a commercial cranberry fruit powder (2 mg PACs) compared to a placebo in 176 women who experienced at least 2 symptomatic UTI in the twelve months preceding the study. In this trial, the proportion of women who experienced greater than one UTI in the cranberry powder group was significantly lower than in the placebo group during the six-month follow-up period (10.8% vs 25.8%, p = 0.04). Although well designed, these studies presented several methodological flaws such as the inclusion of women with complicated UTIs related to catheterization in the former as well as the use of a sub-optimal dose of cranberries in the latter.

### Cranberries for preventing urinary tract infections [^117QGVuZ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Cranberries have been used widely for several decades for the prevention and treatment of urinary tract infections (UTIs). This is the third update of our review first published in 1998 and updated in 2004 and 2008.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of cranberry products in preventing UTIs in susceptible populations.

Search Methods

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL in The Cochrane Library) and the Internet. We contacted companies involved with the promotion and distribution of cranberry preparations and checked reference lists of review articles and relevant studies. Date of search: July 2012

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs of cranberry products for the prevention of UTIs.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed and extracted data. Information was collected on methods, participants, interventions and outcomes (incidence of symptomatic UTIs, positive culture results, side effects, adherence to therapy). Risk ratios (RR) were calculated where appropriate, otherwise a narrative synthesis was undertaken. Quality was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias assessment tool.

Main Results

This updated review includes a total of 24 studies (six cross-over studies, 11 parallel group studies with two arms; five with three arms, and two studies with a factorial design) with a total of 4473 participants. Ten studies were included in the 2008 update, and 14 studies have been added to this update. Thirteen studies (2380 participants) evaluated only cranberry juice/concentrate; nine studies (1032 participants) evaluated only cranberry tablets/capsules; one study compared cranberry juice and tablets; and one study compared cranberry capsules and tablets. The comparison/control arms were placebo, no treatment, water, methenamine hippurate, antibiotics, or lactobacillus. Eleven studies were not included in the meta-analyses because either the design was a cross-over study and data were not reported separately for the first phase, or there was a lack of relevant data. Data included in the meta-analyses showed that, compared with placebo, water or not treatment, cranberry products did not significantly reduce the occurrence of symptomatic UTI overall (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.04) or for any the subgroups: women with recurrent UTIs (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.31); older people (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.44); pregnant women (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.17); children with recurrent UTI (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.19 to 1.22); cancer patients (RR 1.15 95% CI 0.75 to 1.77); or people with neuropathic bladder or spinal injury (RR 0.95, 95% CI: 0.75 to 1.20). Overall heterogeneity was moderate (I² = 55%). The effectiveness of cranberry was not significantly different to antibiotics for women (RR 1.31, 95% CI 0.85, 2.02) and children (RR 0.69 95% CI 0.32 to 1.51). There was no significant difference between gastrointestinal adverse effects from cranberry product compared to those of placebo/no treatment (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.31 to 2.27). Many studies reported low compliance and high withdrawal/dropout problems which they attributed to palatability/acceptability of the products, primarily the cranberry juice. Most studies of other cranberry products (tablets and capsules) did not report how much of the 'active' ingredient the product contained, and therefore the products may not have had enough potency to be effective.

Authors' Conclusions

Prior to the current update it appeared there was some evidence that cranberry juice may decrease the number of symptomatic UTIs over a 12 month period, particularly for women with recurrent UTIs. The addition of 14 further studies suggests that cranberry juice is less effective than previously indicated. Although some of small studies demonstrated a small benefit for women with recurrent UTIs, there were no statistically significant differences when the results of a much larger study were included. Cranberry products were not significantly different to antibiotics for preventing UTIs in three small studies. Given the large number of dropouts/withdrawals from studies (mainly attributed to the acceptability of consuming cranberry products particularly juice, over long periods), and the evidence that the benefit for preventing UTI is small, cranberry juice cannot currently be recommended for the prevention of UTIs. Other preparations (such as powders) need to be quantified using standardised methods to ensure the potency, and contain enough of the 'active' ingredient, before being evaluated in clinical studies or recommended for use.

### Prevention of recurrent urinary tract infection in children [^114CBQQK]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Urinary tract infection (UTI) in children is common (5–10%) and recurs in 10–30%. UTI causes an unpleasant, usually febrile illness in children. This review focuses on studies evaluating interventions to prevent UTI in children and published between January 2007 and June 2008.

Recent Findings

Three relevant updated Cochrane reviews, six randomized trials and an evidence-based guideline were published in the study period. Five of the six trials and one of the three Cochrane updates included data on the effects of relevant interventions in children. Three of the six trials investigated the efficacy of long-term, low-dose antibiotics as prophylaxis, and the other trials and both Cochrane updates evaluated complementary therapies such as vitamin A, probiotics and herbal supplements.

Summary

The benefit of prophylactic antibiotics for the prevention of recurrent UTI in children remains unclear because of underpowered and suboptimally designed trials, but these studies suggest that any benefit is likely to be small, and clinical significance may be limited. The trials of complementary interventions (vitamin A, probiotics, cranberry, nasturtium and horseradish) generally gave favourable results but were not conclusive. Children and families who use these products should be aware that further infections are possible despite their use.

### Whole cranberry fruit powder supplement reduces the incidence of culture-confirmed urinary tract infections in females with a history of recurrent urinary tract infection: a 6-month multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^1124AQi4]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2025). Medium credibility.

Results

A total of 150 females were randomly assigned: n = 75 to the whole cranberry and n = 75 to the placebo groups (Figure 1). Of these, 14 discontinued the intervention or were lost to follow-up (9% dropout rate), 3 from the whole cranberry, and 11 from the placebo group. Of the 150 randomly assigned participants, 5 were excluded from the FAS because either no intervention product was taken or no postbaseline data were collected (2 in the whole cranberry and 3 in the placebo groups) as per the SAP. Therefore, the FAS comprised n = 145 participants (73 in the whole cranberry and 72 in the placebo groups). Additional information about the study population can be found in Supplementary materials (Supplementary Results). The treatment groups appeared balanced with respect to the majority of reported baseline characteristics (Table 1). Notably, the cranberry group included more postmenopausal females, and the first UTIs occurred at a later age compared with the placebo group. More than 95% and 88% of participants in the whole cranberry and placebo groups, respectively, consumed ≥ 80% of prescribed study capsules over the 6-mo study period, and > 80% of participants were compliant overall (Supplemental Table 2).

### Whole cranberry fruit powder supplement reduces the incidence of culture-confirmed urinary tract infections in females with a history of recurrent urinary tract infection: a 6-month multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^1165abyT]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2025). Medium credibility.

The limitations of the current study included, despite using an objective and standard measure to define UTIs, namely microbial growth on urine culture of > 10⁸ cfu/L, it is likely that we missed some positive incidences of UTI over the intervention period. It has been reported that most females who present with typical UTI complaints but have a negative culture still do have an undetectable Escherichia coli infection. Future studies may wish to consider clinical assessments that include a combination of outputs, such as urinary culture results, urinalysis (pyuria), and other common symptoms, to provide a more complete diagnosis of UTI. Although the initial target sample size of n = 300 was not achieved (increasing the type II but not affecting the type I error risk), the absolute reduction in culture-confirmed incidence observed between groups (17%) was greater than initially predicted (15%), which may explain significant results despite a reduced sample size of n = 150. Future studies should record and include as a confounder in the analyses the time since the last UTI before participant enrollment. Although microbial growth on urine culture (≥ 10⁷ cfu/L [10⁴ cfu/mL]) 7 d prebaseline was an exclusion criterion, Maki et al. showed that recent UTI, < 90 d prior to screening, was an important variable associated with the odds of having ≥ 1 UTI. The prespecified primary analysis was conducted on the FAS (a sample of 145 out of 150 participants), which is as complete and as close as possible to the intention-to-treat ideal of including all randomized participants. However, as this is a modification from the intention-to-treat principle, potential bias in the estimation of the treatment effect needs to be considered. Jakobsen et al. however, noted that when the fraction of individuals excluded is small, here 5 of 150 (3.3%), and those missing are unlikely to be individuals likely to be at greatest or lowest risk of outcome, then the risk of bias is negligible. Furthermore, sensitivity analyses testing several plausible assumptions about the outcome for participants excluded from the FAS resulted in the same substantive conclusions as the primary analysis of the primary outcome (see Supplemental materials, Tables 3–5). The per-protocol analysis, which included only n = 117 (out of 150), is at greater risk of bias and resulted in slightly smaller treatment estimates (See Supplemental Discussion for further information). Additionally, this study reports on a substantial number of secondary outcomes related to UTI incidence. These were not prespecified as confirmatory secondary analyses and were not adjusted for multiple testing, and as such, care must be taken when interpreting the reported P values. More dropouts were reported in the placebo group (n = 11) compared with the cranberry (n = 3) group. Reasons for withdrawal did not suggest a relationship to treatment allocation. Finally, it is important to note that the results are generalizable only to females with uncomplicated rUTI, excluding severe cases, over a 6-mo period.

### Consumption of a cranberry juice beverage lowered the number of clinical urinary tract infection episodes in women with a recent history of urinary tract infection [^1169AXUV]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are among the most common bacterial infections and are often treated with antibiotics. Concerns about multidrug-resistant uropathogens have pointed to the need for safe and effective UTI-prevention strategies such as cranberry consumption.

Objective

We assessed the effects of the consumption of a cranberry beverage on episodes of clinical UTIs.

Design

In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter clinical trial, women with a history of a recent UTI were assigned to consume one 240-mL serving of cranberry beverage/d (n = 185) or a placebo (n = 188) beverage for 24 wk. The primary outcome was the clinical UTI incidence density, which was defined as the total number of clinical UTI events (including multiple events per subject when applicable) per unit of observation time.

Results

The dates of the random assignment of the first subject and the last subject's final visit were February 2013 and March 2015, respectively. The mean age was 40.9 y, and characteristics were similar in both groups. Compliance with study product consumption was 98%, and 86% of subjects completed the treatment period in both groups. There were 39 investigator-diagnosed episodes of clinical UTI in the cranberry group compared with 67 episodes in the placebo group (antibiotic use-adjusted incidence rate ratio: 0.61; 95% CI: 0.41, 0.91; P = 0.016). Clinical UTI with pyuria was also significantly reduced (incidence rate ratio: 0.63; 95% CI: 0.40, 0.97; P = 0.037). One clinical UTI event was prevented for every 3.2 woman-years (95% CI: 2.0, 13.1 woman-years) of the cranberry intervention. The time to UTI with culture positivity did not differ significantly between groups (HR: 0.97; 95% CI: 0.56, 1.67; P = 0.914).

Conclusion

The consumption of a cranberry juice beverage lowered the number of clinical UTI episodes in women with a recent history of UTI. This study was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01776021.

### A systematic review of non-antibiotic measures for the prevention of urinary tract infections in pregnancy [^112MMJ1P]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2018). Low credibility.

Cranberry juice

Both RCTs assessing the efficacy of cranberry juice to prevent UTIs in pregnancy concluded that it has the potential to be effective. However, both studies had limitations which shed doubt on the effectiveness of this intervention. The study by Wing et al. was underpowered with a small sample size (188 women). Essadi et al. had a larger cohort (760 women) but compared cranberry juice to water which led to inadequate blinding giving rise to a risk of performance bias i.e. systemic differences between the groups. In addition, it is not clear if they used intention-to-treat analysis which may have distorted the results in favour of cranberry juice. A point to note with regards to Essadi et al. is that it was published as a conference poster and full details were not available but it was included because the abstract reported data in sufficient detail to determine the significance of the results.

A limitation of cranberry juice seen in both studies was the high volume of juice that needed to be ingested (240 mL and 250 ml). Both trials had a high withdrawal rate mostly due to gastrointestinal disturbances which can limit its use on grounds of acceptability to women. These results point to a need to investigate a standardised content of cranberries in alternative formulations such as tablets and capsules which may help with improving adherence and tolerability of this intervention.

Both these trials view cranberry juice as potentially effective at preventing UTIs in pregnancy but a Cochrane review by Jepson et al. included both these studies in a meta-analysis and found cranberries to be ineffective in preventing UTIs in pregnancy. Thus, although there has been interest in using cranberries for UTI prevention, the evidence does not support its efficacy. It can still be used as a self-care option, if preferred by women, because of its known safety in pregnancy.

### Chicken as reservoir for extraintestinal pathogenic Escherichia coli in humans, Canada [^111SBV8v]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections can be difficult and expensive to treat. Most (85%) are caused by bacteria called E. coli. Historically, doctors have believed that these urinary tract E. coli came from the patient's own intestines. But recently, Canadian researchers discovered that not only can these E. coli come from outside the patient's intestines, they can actually come from outside the patient: from food. After comparing the genetic makeup of E. coli from human urinary tract infections with E. coli from retail meat (chicken, beef, and pork), they concluded that chickens are a likely source of E. coli and that the infections probably come directly from the chickens themselves, not from human contamination during food processing. Therefore, prevention of E. coli urinary tract infections in people might need to start on chicken farms.

### Cranberry products and prevention of urinary tract infections [^115GDtHA]. JAMA (2013). Excellent credibility.

Clinical Question

Are cranberry products (juice, tablets, capsules, and syrup) associated with prevention of urinary tract infections (UTIs) compared with placebo or other treatments?

Bottom Line

Cranberry products are not associated with prevention of UTIs. However, lack of association of cranberry products with a reduced incidence of UTIs in clinical trials may be due to lack of participant adherence, lack of sufficient active ingredient in the cranberry product, or lack of sufficient statistical power.

### Food-borne origins of Escherichia coli causing extraintestinal infections [^113fuR5k]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Most human extraintestinal Escherichia coli infections, including those involving antimicrobial resistant strains, are caused by the members of a limited number of distinctive E. coli lineages, termed extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC), that have a special ability to cause disease at extraintestinal sites when they exit their usual reservoir in the host's intestinal tract. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that many of the ExPEC strains encountered in humans with urinary tract infection, sepsis, and other extraintestinal infections, especially the most extensively antimicrobial-resistant strains, may have a food animal source, and may be transmitted to humans via the food supply. This review summarizes the evidence that food-borne organisms are a significant cause of extraintestinal E. coli infections in humans.

### Does urinary pH and diet influence the rate of urinary tract infection recurrence after electrofulguration in women with antibiotic-recalcitrant recurrent urinary tract infections? [^114WQXBF]. Urology (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To assess if urine acidity may be preventative against urinary tract infection (UTIs) and affected by diet. Our goal was to evaluate the effect of urine pH on the rate of recurrent UTIs (RUTIs) after electrofulguration (EF) in 3 groups of women with different urine pH ranges as well as the relation between their diet composition and urine pH.

Methods

In a prior IRB-approved prospective study, women recorded urinary pH 4 times a day and diet for a week. Three urinary pH groups were identified: never below 6, never above 6, and above and below 6. In this study, a 3-day diet analysis involved categorizing different foods by acidity based on pH food charts and calculating amounts consumed using a nutritional analysis database. Rate of UTIs after EF and urine pH after consumption of acidic foods was compared between urine pH groups. Our hypothesis was that low urinary pH protects against RUTIs.

Results

Of 37/69 patients who underwent EF with long median follow-up duration (4–6 years), no difference was found among the groups for UTI frequency, rate, and culture characteristics. There was a no significant difference in the mean amount of acidic foods eaten and the urine pH after each meal as well as in total.

Conclusions

During long-term follow-up, no association was found between urine pH groups and acidic food intake, and rates of UTIs after EF, possibly because of no link between urine pH and UTIs or EF already provokes an important reduction in rates of UTIs.

### Consensus position statement on advancing the classification of patients and tests of cure in studies of antibiotic treatment of complicated urinary tract infections [^111ndMsp]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Complicated urinary tract infections denote an important research field for new antibiotics against Gram-negative pathogens. There is, however, increasing concern that this disease entity is too vaguely defined, leading to heterogeneous study populations and risk of bias. We analysed researchers' adherence to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidance on complicated urinary tract infection and assessed risk of bias using a three-step procedure: literature review of full-text articles on complicated urinary tract infection; assessment of the importance of risk factors for treatment failure, including statistical evaluation of how patients with risk factors might skew treatment effects; and a Delphi consensus process in a multidisciplinary group. Our evaluation showed poor adherence to FDA guidance on complicated urinary tract infection and significant heterogeneity in the reporting of study, patient, and pathogen characteristics, leading to a high risk of bias when interpreting and comparing study findings. We therefore question the concept of complicated urinary tract infection as a meaningful entity with its own study guidance.

### Standardised high dose versus low dose cranberry proanthocyanidin extracts for the prevention of recurrent urinary tract infection in healthy women [PACCANN]: a double blind randomised controlled trial protocol [^117L3uko]. BMC Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Methods

Study design and objectives

To assess the effects of a standardized cranberry extract in sexually active healthy women who present r-UTI, we will undertake a double blind, prospective RCT with 2 arms comparing the mean number of new UTIs during a 6-month period after consumption of a standardized cranberry extract containing 37 mg PACs (2 × 18.5 mg PACs per day) with a control dose of 2 mg PACs (2 × 1 mg PACs per day) in women presenting r-UTI. This protocol was developed in accordance with the Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials (SPIRIT) Statement. The SPIRIT figure is illustrated in Fig. 1.

Fig. 1
Study procedures and characteristics of study visits

The primary objective is to evaluate, in sexually active women who present r-UTIs, the effects of a standardized cranberry extract containing 37 mg type-A linkage PACs per day, compared to a control dose of 2 mg PACs per day during a 6-month period on the incidence rate of newly symptomatic UTIs during a 6-month follow-up period. Secondary objectives are: (1) To evaluate the mean number of new symptomatic UTIs with pyuria as demonstrated by a positive leucocyte esterase test; (2) To detect the mean number of new symptomatic culture-confirmed UTIs; (3) To quantify urinary PACs metabolites in women who take a daily dose of 37 mg PACs per day compared to women who take a daily dose of 2 mg per day for 6 months; (4) To characterize women who present r-UTI based on known risk factors such as spermicidal contraception use, frequency of sexual relations, personal and familial history of UTI; (5) To describe the side effects of daily intake of cranberry extract containing 37 mg PACs compared to 2 mg PACs.

### Foodborne origin and local and global spread of Staphylococcus saprophyticus causing human urinary tract infections [^115ozM5B]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Staphylococcus saprophyticus is the cause of uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI) in 10%–20% of young women. Despite a greater successful treatment rate, S. saprophyticus UTI has a higher recurrent infection frequency than Escherichia coli UTI. Rare complications of S. saprophyticus UTI include acute pyelonephritis, nephrolithiasis, and endocarditis.

S. saprophyticus frequently colonizes humans and can be found in the gastrointestinal tract, vagina, and perineum. S. saprophyticus also is part of the gut and rectal flora of livestock, including pigs and cattle, and a frequent contaminant of meat and fermented food products. S. saprophyticus also has been recovered from polluted aquatic environments.

The reservoirs of S. saprophyticus causing UTI in humans are believed to be endogenous, but evidence is lacking. Moreover, given the frequent bacterial contamination of meat through the meat-processing chain, meat and food are speculated to be sources of human gut colonization and human S. saprophyticus infection. Some studies have reported high genetic diversity among isolates from human infections, food products, and other sources. However, previous studies were performed with a limited number of isolates, which prevented the description of the global and local molecular epidemiology of S. saprophyticus.

We used phenotypic, genomic, and pangenome-wide association study (pan-GWAS) approaches to characterize S. saprophyticus both globally and locally. In addition, we identified adaptive features that drive S. saprophyticus evolution, defined the S. saprophyticus population structure, investigated dissemination routes, and identified new pathogenicity factors.

### The role of nonantibiotic treatment of community-acquired urinary tract infections [^113np9Mq]. Current Opinion in Urology (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To summarize evidence on the efficacy of nonantibiotic treatments in the prevention of recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs). The need for antibiotic-free regimens seems to be imperative given the worldwide rates of resistance of uropathogens to available antibiotics.

Recent Findings

In the recently published literature, cranberry products and probiotics are the focus of research. They both seem to be effective in preventing recurrent UTIs compared with placebo, but their benefit becomes less clear when they are compared with antibiotics.

Summary

A number of nonantibiotic-containing alternatives are available for the prevention of recurrent UTIs. For the majority of these alternatives, contradictory results have been published. These can be, at least partially, explained by variation in doses administered and duration of treatment. Selection of patients more likely to benefit from these interventions seems to be a realistic approach from a clinical-practice perspective, as well a worthwhile focus for future research.

### Meta-analyses in prevention and treatment of urinary tract infections [^113TeMWT]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTI) are common, and complications result in significant morbidity and mortality and also consume resources. This overview summarizes the current evidence for the prevention and treatment of UTI in adults and children from meta-analyses. The quality and applicability of this evidence in clinical practice for different patient groups is discussed. Suggestions are made for future research, because it is apparent that there are evidence gaps for particular subgroups of people.

### Medical management of kidney stones: AUA guideline [^115fJtps]. The Journal of Urology (2014). Medium credibility.

AUA medical management of kidney stones guideline — screening evaluation in newly diagnosed kidney or ureteral stones states: A clinician should perform a screening evaluation consisting of a detailed medical and dietary history, serum chemistries and urinalysis on a patient newly diagnosed with kidney or ureteral stones (Clinical Principle). A detailed history should elicit from the patient any medical conditions, dietary habits or medications that predispose to stone disease; nutritional factors associated with stone disease include calcium intake below or significantly above the recommended dietary allowance, low fluid intake, high sodium intake, limited intake of fruits and vegetables and high intake of animal-derived purines; and patients should be queried regarding their regular use of any stone-provoking medications or supplements. Dietary history should elicit from the patient their average daily intake of fluids (amount and specific beverages), protein (types and amounts), calcium, sodium, high oxalate-containing foods, fruits and vegetables and over-the-counter supplements. Serum chemistries should include electrolytes, calcium, creatinine and uric acid that may suggest underlying medical conditions associated with stone disease. Urinalysis should include both dipstick and microscopic evaluation to assess urine pH and indicators of infection and to identify crystals pathognomonic of stone type, and urine culture should be obtained in patients with a urinalysis suggestive of urinary tract infection or in patients with recurrent UTIs.

### Whole cranberry fruit powder supplement reduces the incidence of culture-confirmed urinary tract infections in females with a history of recurrent urinary tract infection: a 6-month multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^11764yik]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2025). Medium credibility.

TABLE 2
UTI-related outcomes over the 6-mo study period for the FAS.

Results for the per-protocol UTI outcomes are summarized in Supplemental Table 6. The adjusted RR reduction in the whole cranberry powder compared with the placebo group was 40% (adjusted RR: 0.60; 95% CI: 0.32, 1.14; P = 0.12), and when age-squared was included in the model 46% (adjusted RR: 0.54; 95% CI: 0.28, 1.06; P = 0.08), but neither of the models was statistically significant. Incidence of culture-confirmed urinary frequency or urgency was reduced in the whole cranberry powder group compared with the placebo group by 65% (adjusted RR: 0.35; 95% CI: 0.14, 0.86; P = 0.02). The incidence of any one or more culture-confirmed symptoms associated with UTI was reduced by 50% (adjusted RR: 0.50; 95% CI: 0.25, 1.00; P = 0.05). Other UTI outcomes were not statistically significantly different between groups, including time to first culture-confirmed UTI episode.

### Manipulating the gut microbiome in urinary tract infection-prone patients [^113aMXLf]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Although antibiotics remain the mainstay of urinary tract infection treatment, many affected women can be caught in a vicious cycle in which antibiotics given to eradicate one infection predispose them to develop another. This effect is primarily mediated by disturbances in the gut microbiome that both directly enrich for uropathogenic overgrowth and induce systemic alterations in inflammation, tissue permeability, and metabolism that also decrease host resistance to infection recurrences. Here, we discuss nonantibiotic approaches to manipulating the gut microbiome to reverse the systemic consequences of antibiotics, including cranberry supplementation and other dietary approaches, probiotic administration, and fecal microbiota transplantation.

### High dose versus low dose standardized cranberry proanthocyanidin extract for the prevention of recurrent urinary tract infection in healthy women: a double-blind randomized controlled trial [^116kYz8D]. BMC Urology (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Our objective was to assess the efficacy of a high dose cranberry proanthocyanidin extract for the prevention of recurrent urinary tract infection.

Material and Methods

We recruited 145 healthy, adult women with a history of recurrent urinary tract infection, defined as ≥ 2 in the past 6 months or ≥ 3 in the past 12 months in this randomized, controlled, double-blind clinical trial. Participants were randomized to receive a high dose of standardized, commercially available cranberry proanthocyanidins (2×18.5 mg daily, n = 72) or a control low dose (2×1 mg daily, n = 73) for a 24-week period. During follow-up, symptomatic women provided urine samples for detection of pyuria and/or bacteriuria and received an appropriate antibiotic prescription. The primary outcome for the trial was the mean number of new symptomatic urinary tract infections during a 24-week intervention period. Secondary outcomes included symptomatic urinary tract infection with pyuria or bacteriuria.

Results

In response to the intervention, a non-significant 24% decrease in the number of symptomatic urinary tract infections was observed between groups (Incidence rate ratio 0.76, 95%CI 0.51–1.11). Post-hoc analyses indicated that among 97 women who experienced less than 5 infections in the year preceding enrolment, the high dose was associated with a significant decrease in the number of symptomatic urinary tract infections reported compared to the low dose (age-adjusted incidence rate ratio 0.57, 95%CI 0.33–0.99). No major side effects were reported.

Conclusion

High dose twice daily proanthocyanidin extract was not associated with a reduction in the number of symptomatic urinary tract infections when compared to a low dose proanthocyanidin extract. Our post-hoc results reveal that this high dose of proanthocyanidins may have a preventive impact on symptomatic urinary tract infection recurrence in women who experienced less than 5 infections per year.

### D-mannose for preventing and treating urinary tract infections [^111MeHfU]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are very common, affecting more than 7 million people worldwide. Whilst many people may only experience a single episode in their lifetime and are generally responsive to standard antibiotics, a significant proportion of adults and children (approximately 15% to 25%) are chronic symptomatic UTI sufferers. Certain population groups are at greater risk than others, such as immunosuppressed and people with chronic kidney disease. D-mannose is a sugar part of normal human metabolism found within most diets. The mechanism of action is to prevent bacterial adherence to the uroepithelial cells. The D-mannose-based inhibitors can block uropathogenic Escherichia coli adhesion and invasion of the uroepithelial cells. The bacteria are then understood to essentially be eliminated by urination. Early pilot studies on animals and humans have trialled concentrated forms of D-mannose (tablets or sachets) in doses ranging from 200 mg up to 2 to 3 g and found possible efficacy in reducing UTI symptoms or recurrence. Although the anti-adhesive effects of D-mannose have been well-established, only recently have we seen a small number of pilot studies and small clinical trials conducted.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of D-mannose for preventing and treating UTIs in adults and children.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 22 February 2022 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov.

Selection Criteria

We included RCTs measuring and reporting the effect of D-mannose, in any combination and any formulation, to prevent or treat UTIs in adults and children, females and males, in any setting (including perioperative). Authors independently assessed the retrieved titles and abstracts and, where necessary, the full text to determine which satisfied the inclusion criteria.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data extraction was independently carried out by two authors using a standard data extraction form. Methodological quality of the included studies was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Data entry was carried out by one author and cross-checked by another author. The certainty of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We included seven RCTs (719 participants) in adult females and males who had either acute cystitis or a history of recurrent (at least two episodes in six months or three episodes in 12 months) UTIs (symptomatic or asymptomatic). Two were prevention studies, four were prevention and treatment studies (two perioperative and one in people with multiple sclerosis), and one was a treatment study. Time periods ranged from 15 days to six months. No two studies were comparable (by dose or treatments), and we could not undertake meta-analyses. Individual studies reported no clear evidence to determine whether D-mannose is more or less effective in preventing or treating UTIs. D-mannose (2 g) had uncertain effects on symptomatic and bacteriuria-confirmed UTIs when compared to no treatment (1 study, 205 participants; very low certainty evidence) and antibiotics (nitrofurantoin 50 mg) (1 study, 206 participants; very low certainty evidence). D-mannose, in combination with herbal supplements, had uncertain effects on symptomatic and bacteria-confirmed UTI and pain when compared to no treatment (1 study, 40 participants; very low certainty evidence). D-mannose 500 mg plus supplements (N-acetylcysteine and Morinda citrifolia fruit extract) had uncertain effects on symptomatic and bacteriuria-confirmed UTIs when compared to an antibiotic (prulifloxacin 400 mg) (1 study, 75 participants; very low certainty evidence). Adverse events were very few and poorly reported; none were serious (mostly diarrhoea and vaginal burning). Overall, the quality of the evidence is poor. Most studies were judged to have unclear or high risk of bias across most domains. Data was sparse and addressed very few outcomes. The GRADE evaluation was rated as very low certainty evidence due to very serious limitations in the study design or execution (high risk of bias across all studies) and sparse data (single study data and small sample sizes).

Authors' Conclusions

There is currently little to no evidence to support or refute the use of D-mannose to prevent or treat UTIs in all populations. This review highlights the severe lack of high-quality RCTs testing the efficacy of D-mannose for UTIs in any population. Despite UTIs being one of the most common adult infections (affecting 50% of women at least once in their lifetime) and the growing global antimicrobial resistance, we found very few studies that adequately test this alternative treatment. Future research in this field requires, in the first instance, a single adequately powered RCT comparing D-mannose with placebo.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^116scJSi]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections (rUTIs) in women — clinicians should offer cranberry as an option for prophylaxis for women with rUTIs (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade B). The 2019 systematic review identified 8 randomized trials including cranberry versus placebo/no cranberry (6 randomized controlled trials [RCTs]) and cranberry versus antibiotics (2 RCTs), and cranberry was associated with decreased risk of experiencing at least 1 UTI recurrence than placebo or no cranberry (5 trials; RR: 0.67, 95% CI: 0.54 to 0.83; ARD: -11%, 95% CI: -16% to 5%). Examples included a 20% reduction in UTIs with 50 mL of daily cranberry-lingonberry juice concentrate over 6 months, one 240 mL serving of cranberry beverage daily yielding an antibiotic use-adjusted incidence rate ratio (IRR) of 0.61 (95% CI: 0.41 to 0.91; P = 0.016), and cranberry juice and cranberry tablets significantly decreasing the number of patients experiencing at least 1 symptomatic UTI per year to 20% and 18% compared with placebo to 32% (p < 0.05). Cranberry fruit powder reduced UTI significantly at 18.8% versus 25.8% (p = 0.04) in women who received 500 mg daily for 6 months, and the product had a PAC content of 0.56%. Against antibiotics, there was no statistically significant difference in risk of experiencing at least 1 UTI after 6 or 12 months (RR: 1.30; 95% CI: 0.79 to 2.14; I² = 68%), and a trial comparing cranberry versus TMP-SMX reported RR: 1.09 (95% CI: 0.92 to 1.28). For dosing considerations, most healthcare providers would agree that a cranberry supplement standardized to at least 36 mg of bioavailable proanthocyanidins (PACs) is a good option, and a systematic review suggested that cranberry supplements standardized to at least 36 mg PACs are more effective in reducing UTI recurrence than those which contain less than 36 mg, while the available evidence suggests the potential harms from cranberry use are minimal.

### Continuous low-dose antibiotic prophylaxis for adults with repeated urinary tract infections (AnTIC): a randomised, open-label trial [^1151WYAL]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2018). Medium credibility.

The effectiveness of continuous low-dose antibiotic prophylaxis against UTIs in users of CISC who had repeated episodes increases the number of patient groups with repeated or chronic infections who have been shown to benefit from this strategy. The increased frequency of antimicrobial resistance in potential urinary pathogens to antibiotics that are used for treatment of UTIs is a concern for individuals and for public health. Increased resistance occurred in the prophylaxis group despite reduced use of antibiotics to treat symptomatic UTIs. The mechanism by which low-dose antibiotic prophylaxis provides a benefit is uncertain. Our results show that episodes of symptomatic UTIs (indicating infection with urinary pathogens) are suppressed while the incidence of asymptomatic bacteriuria (indicating urinary colonisation) was unchanged. It is possible that pathogenic bacterial strains with particular virulence factors are preferentially targeted by low-dose continuous therapy, or changes in the host response might be induced, allowing tolerance of colonisers but eradication of pathogens. Alternatively, bacteria colonising the bladder could be protected in specific niches that cannot be accessed by low urinary concentrations of antibiotic.

Evidence-based alternative ways of reducing the risk of UTIs and the severity of symptoms in women include non-antibiotic prophylaxis with methenamine hippurateand vaginal oestrogen supplementation; however, neither has been tested for CISC users. Frequency of use of non-antibiotic preventative strategies was similar in both groups of this trial: increased fluid intake, increased frequency of catheterisation, and ingestion of cranberry products and probiotics were the most popular interventions (data not shown). Cranberry extracts, although often taken, do not appear effective in reducing the risk of UTIs in CISC users.

An alternative antibiotic-based strategy is so-called self-start therapy, whereby patients have a supply of antibiotics at home and can start a treatment course when their typical symptoms occur. In the present trial, participants in the control group reported self-start therapy to be the source of their treatment antibiotics more often than the prophylaxis group, but we cannot speculate further from these data as to whether this treatment option is a viable alternative to continuous prophylaxis in our trial population.

### Cranberry constituents prevent SOS-mediated filamentation of uropathogenic [^112ipS6T]. Infection and Immunity (2025). Medium credibility.

Prophylaxis with cranberry juice and cranberry capsules is effective to prevent recurrent UTIs in young and middle-aged women. In addition, a recent Cochrane systematic review of studies involving almost 9,000 patients concluded that there is clinical evidence for reduced rates of symptomatic culture-proven recurrent UTIs in women and children who consume cranberry products. However, there is no current consensus on the mechanism of efficacy nor the specific components of cranberries that are efficacious. Many labs have implicated PACs in preventing binding of UPEC to bladder epithelial cells. However, these studies investigated the effect of P-pilus adhesion on bladder epithelial cells, whereas the Type 1 pilus is the essential adhesin for binding to the bladder. The bioavailability of cranberry constituents in the plasma and urine is well investigated in humans and provides the platform for comparison of products identified and the potential utility in humans. In addition, these studies have demonstrated that intact PACs are not excreted in human urine and thus are unavailable to prevent binding of bacteria to the urothelium. Additional mechanistic studies also refute the activity of PACs in the urinary tract and suggest potential roles in the gastrointestinal tract. Our study did not reveal a single cranberry component that contributes to the phenotype. However, our observed potency with PURE juice and powder C that contained minimal levels of PACs is consistent with other studies that these molecules are likely not responsible for the effect of cranberry juice. Future studies will compare the components of medicinal foods that do not reduce filamentation to assist in defining the potential active molecules.

### Cranberry juice fails to prevent recurrent urinary tract infection: results from a randomized placebo-controlled trial [^112ymYcu]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Background

A number of observational studies and a few small or open randomized clinical trials suggest that the American cranberry may decrease incidence of recurring urinary tract infection (UTI).

Methods

We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of the effects of cranberry on risk of recurring UTI among 319 college women presenting with an acute UTI. Participants were followed up until a second UTI or for 6 months, whichever came first. A UTI was defined on the basis of the combination of symptoms and a urine culture positive for a known uropathogen. The study was designed to detect a 2-fold difference between treated and placebo groups, as was detected in unblinded trials. We assumed 30% of participants would experience a UTI during the follow-up period.

Results

Overall, the recurrence rate was 16.9% (95% confidence interval, 12.8%-21.0%), and the distribution of the recurrences was similar between study groups, with the active cranberry group presenting a slightly higher recurrence rate (20.0% vs 14.0%). The presence of urinary symptoms at 3 days, 1–2 weeks, and at ≥ 1 month was similar between study groups, with overall no marked differences. CONCLUSIONS.: Among otherwise healthy college women with an acute UTI, those drinking 8 oz of 27% cranberry juice twice daily did not experience a decrease in the 6-month incidence of a second UTI, compared with those drinking a placebo.

### Nonantibiotic prevention and management of recurrent urinary tract infection [^115Ba668]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2018). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are highly prevalent, lead to considerable patient morbidity, incur large financial costs to health-care systems and are one of the most common reasons for antibiotic use worldwide. The growing problem of antimicrobial resistance means that the search for nonantibiotic alternatives for the treatment and prevention of UTI is of critical importance. Potential nonantibiotic measures and treatments for UTIs include behavioural changes, dietary supplementation (such as Chinese herbal medicines and cranberry products), NSAIDs, probiotics, D-mannose, methenamine hippurate, estrogens, intravesical glycosaminoglycans, immunostimulants, vaccines and inoculation with less-pathogenic bacteria. Some of the results of trials of these approaches are promising; however, high-level evidence is required before firm recommendations for their use can be made. A combination of these agents might provide the optimal treatment to reduce recurrent UTI, and trials in specific population groups are required.

### Whole cranberry fruit powder supplement reduces the incidence of culture-confirmed urinary tract infections in females with a history of recurrent urinary tract infection: a 6-month multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^111kspb9]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2025). Medium credibility.

There were no safety concerns related to the cranberry treatment reported in the current study, and the dropout rate was low at 9%. Jepson et al. reported in their meta-analysis on cranberry products and UTI that many studies reported low compliance and high withdrawal/dropout problems attributable to palatability/acceptability of the products, primarily cranberry juice. Therefore, it can be suggested that a juice or beverage product may be less acceptable for use as a long-term prophylactic treatment, and a supplement form, such as the supplement used in the current trial, may be more suitable.

Strengths of the current study included targeting females at elevated risk for UTI episodes, who were appropriately clinically diagnosed with a history of rUTI, but otherwise healthy and most likely to benefit from cranberry supplementation. Females experiencing higher numbers of UTIs (> 5 UTIs in the past 6 mo) were excluded as it was believed that they may not respond to supplement treatment. The fact that incidence rate of UTI during the study in the placebo group (34%) was as predicted in sample size estimates (25%–35%) supports that participants were appropriately diagnosed with rUTI and that the methods for diagnosing UTIs during the study were suitable and effective. Finally, sensitivity analyses were conducted and showed that the estimated treatment effects were unchanged when testing various assumptions about the UTI incidence status of participants lost to follow-up.

### High dose versus low dose standardized cranberry proanthocyanidin extract for the prevention of recurrent urinary tract infection in healthy women: a double-blind randomized controlled trial [^116iZgXc]. BMC Urology (2021). Medium credibility.

Post-hoc and sensitivity analysis

In the case of imbalanced groups, we generated relative rate estimates adjusted for potential confounding variables. Univariate regression analyses were performed for relevant variables collected at the baseline visit and data collected from post-hoc questions. Missing data was excluded from analyses for post-hoc questions. Variables with a p value < 0.20 in univariate analysis were included in the multivariate regression model. Interactions with the treatment groups were tested in multivariate regression model using a backward elimination method. Interactions with a p value < 0.05 are presented in the results by subgroup of the effect-modifying factor.

The incidence of UTI with pyuria or bacteriuria was estimated using a statistical imputation method for missing urine samples with two extreme assumptions: symptomatic UTI episodes without urine samples were classified as (1) no symptomatic UTI with pyuria or bacteriuria; and (2) symptomatic UTI with pyuria or bacteriuria.

### Standardised high dose versus low dose cranberry proanthocyanidin extracts for the prevention of recurrent urinary tract infection in healthy women [PACCANN]: a double blind randomised controlled trial protocol [^115ZT3T7]. BMC Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are amongst the most common bacterial infections affecting women. Although antibiotics are the treatment of choice for UTI, cranberry derived products have been used for many years to prevent UTIs, with limited evidence as to their efficacy. Our objective is to assess the efficacy of a cranberry extract capsule standardized in A-type linkage proanthocyanidins (PACs) for the prevention of recurrent urinary tract infection.

Methods

We will perform a 1:1 randomized, controlled, double blind clinical trial in women aged 18 years or more who present ≥ 2 UTIs in 6 months or ≥ 3 UTIs in 12 months. One hundred and forty-eight women will be recruited and randomized in two groups to either receive an optimal dose of cranberry extract quantified and standardized in PACs (2 × 18.5 mg PACs per day) or a control dose (2 × 1 mg PACs per day). The primary outcome for the trial is the mean number of new symptomatic UTIs in women during a 6-month intervention period. Secondary outcomes are: (1) To evaluate the mean number of new symptomatic UTIs with pyuria as demonstrated by a positive leucocyte esterase test; (2) To detect the mean number of new symptomatic culture-confirmed UTIs; (3) To quantify urinary PACs metabolites in women who take a daily dose of 37 mg PACs per day compared to women who take a daily dose of 2 mg per day for 6 months; (4) To characterize women who present recurrent UTI based on known risk factors for recurrent UTI; (5) To describe the side effects of daily intake of cranberry extract containing 37 mg PACs compared to 2 mg PACs. This report provides comprehensive methodological data for this randomized controlled trial.

Discussion

The results of this trial will inform urologists, gynaecologists, family physicians and other healthcare professionals caring for healthy women with recurrent UTI, as to the benefits of daily use of an optimal dose of cranberry extract for the prevention of recurrent UTI.

### Cranberries for preventing urinary tract infections [^114mRS4A]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Cranberries have been used widely for several decades for the prevention and treatment of urinary tract infections (UTIs).

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of cranberry products in preventing UTIs in susceptible populations.

Search Strategy

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL in The Cochrane Library) and the Internet. We contacted companies involved with the promotion and distribution of cranberry preparations and checked reference lists of review articles and relevant studies. Date of last search: January 2007.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs of cranberry products for the prevention of UTIs in all populations.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed and extracted information. Information was collected on methods, participants, interventions and outcomes (UTIs - symptomatic and asymptomatic, side effects, adherence to therapy). Relative risk (RR) were calculated where appropriate, otherwise a narrative synthesis was undertaken. Quality was assessed using the Cochrane criteria.

Main Results

Ten studies (n = 1049, five cross-over, five parallel group) were included. Cranberry/cranberry-lingonberry juice versus placebo, juice or water was evaluated in seven studies, and cranberries tablets versus placebo in four studies (one study evaluated both juice and tablets). Cranberry products significantly reduced the incidence of UTIs at 12 months (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.90) compared with placebo/control. Cranberry products were more effective reducing the incidence of UTIs in women with recurrent UTIs, than elderly men and women or people requiring catheterisation. Six studies were not included in the meta-analyses due to methodological issues or lack of available data. However, only one reported a significant result for the outcome of symptomatic UTIs. Side effects were common in all studies, and dropouts/withdrawals in several of the studies were high.

Authors' Conclusions

There is some evidence that cranberry juice may decrease the number of symptomatic UTIs over a 12 month period, particularly for women with recurrent UTIs. It's effectiveness for other groups is less certain. The large number of dropouts/withdrawals indicates that cranberry juice may not be acceptable over long periods of time. It is not clear what is the optimum dosage or method of administration (e.g. juice, tablets or capsules). Further properly designed studies with relevant outcomes are needed.

### Whole cranberry fruit powder supplement reduces the incidence of culture-confirmed urinary tract infections in females with a history of recurrent urinary tract infection: a 6-month multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^113rXCqS]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2025). Medium credibility.

Statistical analyses

Data collected during this study were processed and managed as per a prespecified data management plan. The original sample size calculation indicated n = 300 females (150 participants in each group) provided ≥ 80% power to detect an absolute reduction of 15% in the rate of culture-confirmed UTI incidence between treatment groups (2-sided alpha = 0.05), given expected control group incidence is 25%–35% and dropout rate of ≤ 10%. At the time when recruitment ceased, n = 150 patients had been randomly assigned (75 participants in each treatment group). It was calculated that a revised sample size of n = 150 (75 participants in each group) provided 80% power to detect an absolute reduction of ∼19% in the rate of culture-confirmed UTI incidence between treatment groups (2-sided alpha = 0.05) given an incidence of 30%. No interim analysis was conducted.

Primary efficacy analyses were conducted according to the intention-to-treat principle on the full analysis set (FAS) comprising all randomly assigned participants with ≥ 1 dose of study treatment and with ≥ 1 nonmissing postbaseline value for the primary outcome and according to their randomly assigned treatment allocation. Following recommendations of Jakobsen et al. missing outcome data were not imputed, given the proportions of missing outcome data were small (< 5%) and baseline covariate data were complete. The FAS, thus, included all randomly assigned individuals with both baseline data and valid outcome data and who took ≥ 1 dose of study medication. Secondary per-protocol analyses were performed on the per-protocol set comprising all randomly assigned participants who were compliant with treatment and reported no major deviations or violations with respect to the protocol (see Supplementary material for assessment of protocol compliance and major protocol deviations or violations), according to the study treatment received. Analyses of safety outcomes were conducted on the safety set (SS), comprising all randomly assigned participants who received ≥ 1 dose of study treatment, according to the study treatment received. The level of statistical significance was set at 0.05 (2-sided). No adjustment for multiple testing was performed.

### Probiotics for preventing urinary tract infections in adults and children [^113dwGy3]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a common bacterial infection that can lead to significant morbidity including stricture, abscess formation, fistula, bacteraemia, sepsis, pyelonephritis and kidney dysfunction. Mortality rates are reported to be as high as 1% in men and 3% in women due to development of pyelonephritis. Because probiotic therapy is readily available without a prescription, a review of their efficacy in the prevention of UTI may aid consumers in making informed decisions about potential prophylactic therapy. Institutions and caregivers also need evidence-based synopses of current evidence to make informed patient care decisions.

Objectives

Compared to placebo or no therapy, did probiotics (any formulation) provide a therapeutic advantage in terms of morbidity and mortality, when used to prevent UTI in susceptible patient populations?Compared to other prophylactic interventions, including drug and non-drug measures (e.g. continuous antibiotic prophylaxis, topical oestrogen, cranberry juice), did probiotics (any formulation) provide a therapeutic advantage in terms of morbidity and mortality when used to prevent UTIs in susceptible patient populations?

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Specialised Register to 21 September 2015 through contact with the Trials' Search Co-ordinator using search terms relevant to this review.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of susceptible patients (e.g. past history of UTI) or healthy people in which any strain, formulation, dose or frequency of probiotic was compared to placebo or active comparators were included.

Data Collection and Analysis

All RCTs and quasi-RCTs (RCTs in which allocation to treatment was obtained by alternation, use of alternate medical records, date of birth or other predictable methods) looking at comparing probiotics to no therapy, placebo, or other prophylactic interventions were included. Summary estimates of effect were obtained using a random-effects model, and results were expressed as risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes.

Main Results

We included nine studies that involved 735 people in this review. Four studies compared probiotic with placebo, two compared probiotic with no treatment, two compared probiotics with antibiotics in patients with UTI, and one study compared probiotic with placebo in healthy women. All studies aimed to measure differences in rates of recurrent UTI. Our risk of bias assessment found that most studies had small sample sizes and reported insufficient methodological detail to enable robust assessment. Overall, there was a high risk of bias in the included studies which lead to inability to draw firm conclusions and suggesting that any reported treatment effects may be misleading or represent overestimates. We found no significant reduction in the risk of recurrent symptomatic bacterial UTI between patients treated with probiotics and placebo (6 studies, 352 participants: RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.12; I² = 23%) with wide confidence intervals, and statistical heterogeneity was low. No significant reduction in the risk of recurrent symptomatic bacterial UTI was found between probiotic and antibiotic treated patients (1 study, 223 participants: RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.33). The most commonly reported adverse effects were diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, constipation and vaginal symptoms. None of the included studies reported numbers of participants with at least one asymptomatic bacterial UTI, all-cause mortality or those with at least one confirmed case of bacteraemia or fungaemia. Two studies reported study withdrawal due to adverse events and the number of participants who experienced at least one adverse event. One study reported withdrawal occurred in six probiotic participants (5.2%), 15 antibiotic participants (12.2%), while the second study noted one placebo group participant discontinued treatment due to an adverse event.

Authors' Conclusions

No significant benefit was demonstrated for probiotics compared with placebo or no treatment, but a benefit cannot be ruled out as the data were few, and derived from small studies with poor methodological reporting. There was limited information on harm and mortality with probiotics and no evidence on the impact of probiotics on serious adverse events. Current evidence cannot rule out a reduction or increase in recurrent UTI in women with recurrent UTI who use prophylactic probiotics. There was insufficient evidence from one RCT to comment on the effect of probiotics versus antibiotics.

### Management of uncomplicated urinary tract infection in the post-antibiotic era: select non-antibiotic approaches [^1144wrVF]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Given the high frequency of patients presenting with urinary tract infections (UTIs) and the ensuing high degree of antibiotic prescription, UTI is a critical point of intervention for non-antibiotic treatments to curb the further development of antimicrobial resistance and provide risk-appropriate care for patients.

Objectives

To highlight several select non-antibiotic therapies for the treatment of uncomplicated UTI and relevant indications (prevention and complicated UTI) from recent literature.

Sources

PubMed, Google Scholar, and clinicaltrials.gov were searched for clinical trials published in the English language corresponding to non-antibiotic treatments for UTI.

Content

The focus of this narrative review centres on a limited number of non-antibiotic therapies for the treatment of UTI based on (a) herbal extracts or (b) antibacterial strategies (e.g. bacteriophage therapy and D-mannose). The experience of treatment with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs is also used to fuel discussion on the risk of developing pyelonephritis without antibiotics-compared with the projected harms of continuing their widespread use.

Implications

Non-antibiotic treatment strategies for UTI have shown varying results in clinical trials, and the current evidence does not yet indicate a clear, better alternative to antibiotics. However, the collective experience with non-antibiotic treatments suggests that there is a need to weigh the actual benefits/risks of unfettered, non-culture-confirmed antibiotic use in uncomplicated UTI. Given the different mechanisms of action of proposed alternatives, more in-depth knowledge on microbiological and pathophysiological factors influencing UTI susceptibility and prognostic indicators are highly needed to stratify patients most likely to benefit. The feasibility of alternatives in clinical practice should also be considered.

### Scientific advances in understanding the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and prevention of urinary tract infection in the past 10 Years [^117BehL6]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a very common disease that is accompanied by various complications in the affected person. UTI triggers diverse inflammatory reactions locally in the infected urinary bladder and kidney, causing tissue destruction and organ failure. Moreover, systemic responses in the entire body carry the risk of urosepsis with far-reaching consequences. Understanding the cell-, organ-, and systemic mechanisms in UTI are crucial for prevention, early intervention, and current therapeutic approaches. This review summarizes the scientific advances over the last 10 years concerning pathogenesis, prevention, rapid diagnosis, and new treatment approaches. We also highlight the impact of the immune system and potential new therapies to reduce progressive and recurrent UTI.

### Nonantibiotic treatments for urinary cystitis: an update [^113tME1t]. Current Opinion in Urology (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are one of most common infections in everyday clinical practice. Given the increase in antimicrobial therapy resistance, there has been an increased interest in nonantibiotic treatment options for common infections.

Recent Findings

A review of the recent literature including on nonantibiotic options for management of UTIs, symptoms of cystitis and prevention of recurrent UTIs.

Summary

The article provides an overview on alternative therapy to antibiotics in the treatment of cystitis and recurrent UTI prophylaxis, including alkalinization of urine, cranberry products, probiotics, NSAIDS, D-mannose, herbal medicine, methenamine hippurate, oral immunostimulants (immunotherapy), topical oestrogens, vitamins and acupuncture. The last few years of intense research has focused on an effort to find evidence to corroborate potentially efficacious non antibiotic treatments. However, alternative treatments for UTIs have not brought conclusive evidence that antibiotic usage can be replaced completely by nonantibiotic options. The reason for this is largely due to a lack of good-quality randomized controlled trials on this subject.

### Cranberry for prevention of urinary tract infections [^113yGYNG]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Traditionally, cranberry has been used for the treatment and prophylaxis of urinary tract infections. Research suggests that its mechanism of action is preventing bacterial adherence to host cell surface membranes. Systematic reviews have concluded that no reliable evidence supports the use of cranberry in the treatment or prophylaxis of urinary tract infections; however, more recent, randomized controlled trials demonstrate evidence of cranberry's utility in urinary tract infection prophylaxis. Supporting studies in humans are lacking for other clinical uses of cranberry. Cranberry is a safe, well-tolerated herbal supplement that does not have significant drug interactions.

### Whole cranberry fruit powder supplement reduces the incidence of culture-confirmed urinary tract infections in females with a history of recurrent urinary tract infection: a 6-month multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^115A3BTG]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

High prevalence of urinary tract infections (UTI), including cystitis, and concern for antimicrobial resistance justify safe and effective nonantibiotic therapies for prevention of recurrent UTI (rUTI).

Objectives

This study investigated the effect of a whole cranberry fruit powder supplement on incidence of culture-confirmed UTI (primary outcome) in females with rUTI history.

Methods

This multicenter, 6-mo, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study enrolled 150 healthy females [18–65 y, body mass index (BMI) > 17.5 and < 35 kg/m 2] with rUTI defined as ≥ 3 UTIs in the last year or ≤ 2 UTIs in the last 6 mo, excluding those with > 5 UTIs in the last 6 mo. Participants consumed either 1 capsule of 500 mg/d of whole cranberry powder (Pacran) or placebo. Culture-confirmed UTIs (> 10⁸ cfu/L) were assessed throughout the intervention period at unscheduled clinic visits whenever participants experienced UTI symptoms and at baseline, 3- and 6-mo clinic visits. Symptomatic suspected UTIs were defined as participant-reported UTI-associated symptoms at unscheduled visits.

Results

Whole cranberry powder capsules reduced culture-confirmed UTI risk compared with placebo by 52% (adjusted relative risk [RR]: 0.48; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.26, 0.87; P = 0.01); reduced Escherichia coli UTIs (RR: 0.49; 95% CI: 0.24, 1.01; P = 0.05); reduced incidence of UTI with urinary frequency and urgency symptomatology (RR: 0.29; 95% CI:0.13, 0.63; P < 0.01); delayed time to first UTI episode (adjusted hazard ratio [HR]: 0.36; 95% CI: 0.18, 0.74; P = 0.01); and reduced the mean total number of UTIs per participant (adjusted incidence rate ratio IRR: 0.41; 95% CI: 0.21, 0.79; P = 0.01). Significant differences between groups in incidence of symptomatic suspected UTIs and culture-confirmed dysuria were not observed. Exploratory scores for UTI-related female sexual matters, assessed in a subset of sexually active, consenting females, did not differ significantly between groups. No safety concerns were reported.

Conclusion

This study shows that whole cranberry powder capsules do not impact safety markers and reduce the incidence of culture-confirmed UTI and several other UTI-related outcomes in healthy females with rUTI history. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov asNCT03042273.

### Cranberries for treating urinary tract infections [^113Uri89]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Cranberries (particularly in the form of cranberry juice) have been used widely for several decades for the prevention and treatment of urinary tract infections (UTIs). The aim of this review is to assess the effectiveness of cranberries in treating such infections.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of cranberries for the treatment of UTIs.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 1 August 2023 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Registry Portal (ICTRP) Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs of cranberry juice or cranberry products for the treatment of UTIs. Studies of men, women or children were to be included.

Data Collection and Analysis

Titles and abstracts of studies that were potentially relevant to the review were screened and studies that were clearly ineligible were discarded. Further information was sought from the authors where papers contained insufficient information to make a decision about eligibility.

Main Results

No studies were found that fulfilled all of our inclusion criteria. Seven studies were excluded because they were the wrong study design, mixed interventions or did not report any relevant outcomes. One study is ongoing; however, its current status is unknown.

Authors' Conclusions

After a thorough search, no RCTs which assessed the effectiveness of cranberry juice for the treatment of UTIs were found. Therefore, at the present time, there is no good quality evidence to suggest that it is effective for the treatment of UTIs. Well-designed parallel-group, double-blind studies comparing cranberry juice and other cranberry products versus placebo to assess the effectiveness of cranberry juice in treating UTIs are needed. Outcomes should include a reduction in symptoms, sterilisation of the urine, side effects and adherence to therapy. The dosage (amount and concentration) and duration of therapy should also be assessed. Consumers and clinicians will welcome the evidence from these studies.

### High dose versus low dose standardized cranberry proanthocyanidin extract for the prevention of recurrent urinary tract infection in healthy women: a double-blind randomized controlled trial [^113UaxzZ]. BMC Urology (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This randomized clinical trial is the first to evaluate the efficacy of a standardized split daily dose of 37 mg cranberry PACs in capsule form on symptomatic UTI. It is of particular interest that this dose was compared to another cranberry extract containing a low concentration of PACs, as often found on the Canadian supplement market to prevent UTI. Our results indicate that the intake of 2 × 18.5 mg PACs daily was associated with a non-statistically significant 24% reduction in the risk of symptomatic UTI compared to a daily dose of 2 × 1 mg PACs during a 24-week follow-up period, similar to the results of a recent meta-analysis.

The present study is distinct given that we recruited according to a guideline-based definition of recurrent UTI. Our cohort had a higher mean incidence of UTI prior to study enrolment (mean UTI = 2.4/6 months and 3.9/1 year) compared to similar trials such as Maki et al. (1.65/6 months), Barbosa-Cesnik et al. (1.13 /1 year) or Stothers et al. (2.8/1 year). The proportion of women in the 2 mg PAC group that experienced more than 1 UTI (53.4%) was also greater than the estimated 35% used to calculate our sample size. Considering these key differences with previous reports, we explored if UTI burden at baseline could impact the treatment effect. Statistical analysis confirmed that number of recurrent UTI was indeed a modifying factor. In women who experienced fewer than 5 UTI (mean number = 3.1) in the year prior to enrolment, symptomatic UTIs were significantly reduced by 43%. No significant effect was observed in women with higher past UTI burden.

### Cost-effectiveness of cranberry capsules to prevent urinary tract infection in long-term care facilities: economic evaluation with a randomized controlled trial [^112Jejca]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

This study investigated whether the use of cranberry capsules is more cost-effective than placebo based on data from a randomized controlled trial. In participants with low UTI risk, the use of cranberry capsules did not prevent UTIs, and consequently, their use is not cost-effective. In high-UTI-risk participants, there were fewer clinically defined UTIs. Moreover, there was a significant, but moderate, short-term effect of those UTIs on quality of life and care dependency. Most of the QALY gain was due to the prevented UTI mortality, resulting in a gain in life expectancy of approximately 2 weeks. This relative 1.5% improvement in life expectancy is consistent with the estimated mortality attributable to UTI (7.7%) combined with the 26% treatment effect.

Savings on prevented UTIs partly compensate for the costs of the cranberry capsules, but using a lifelong perspective, those savings added up to approximately €50. As a result, the overall cost difference is about equal to the costs of the cranberry capsules, estimated at €439 per year or at €3,800 per prevented clinically defined UTI. The health gain in terms of QALYs was small in comparison with the costs, so use of cranberry capsules was not likely to be cost-effective (22% for a WTP threshold of €40,000 per QALY).

### Whole cranberry fruit powder supplement reduces the incidence of culture-confirmed urinary tract infections in females with a history of recurrent urinary tract infection: a 6-month multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^115jfQyG]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2025). Medium credibility.

Sensitivity analysis

In the primary analysis, participants who were lost to follow-up or discontinued the intervention and recorded 0 culture-confirmed UTIs were assumed to not have experienced a culture-confirmed UTI during the study period. To assess the sensitivity of results to this assumption, the analyses were repeated, first by including these participants as UTI-positive in the analysis and second by excluding these participants from the analyses.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^116GSgYo]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Recurrent urinary tract infection prevention — cranberry juice comparative effectiveness from a 2024 network meta-analysis indicates reductions in UTI incidence and antibiotic use. In over 3,000 participants across 20 trials, cranberry juice consumption led to a 54% lower rate of UTIs compared to no treatment and a 27% lower rate than placebo liquid; it also reduced antibiotic use by up to 50% compared to no treatment and significantly lessened UTI symptoms. While increased fluid intake and cranberry tablets offered some benefits, cranberry juice provided the most substantial reduction in UTI incidence and antibiotic reliance.

### Recurrent UTI in women-risk factors and management [^111kzGSH]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common in women; more than 50% of women will be diagnosed with a UTI in her lifetime. Many of these women will go on to develop recurrent UTI. Nevertheless, evidence-based prevention of recurrent UTI is under-utilized. Here, the authors provide detailed practical advice on UTI prevention with a thorough review of the evidence. Non-antibiotic prevention measures discussed include increased fluid intake, vaginal estrogen therapy, methenamine, and cranberry. Antibiotic prophyalxis for carefully selected patients is also discussed.

### A systematic review of non-antibiotic measures for the prevention of urinary tract infections in pregnancy [^112eGX1X]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common in pregnancy and account for the highest proportion of primary care antibiotic prescriptions issued to pregnant women in the UK. It is well known that antibiotic use is associated with increased antimicrobial resistance and therefore measures to minimise antibiotic use for UTI prevention have been studied. The efficacy and safety of these measures in pregnancy have not been addressed and therefore the aim of this study was to systematically review the literature to identify and evaluate potential measures to prevent UTIs in pregnant women.

Methods

Ten databases (EMBASE, AMED, BNI, CINAHL, Medline, PubMed, PsycINFO, Cochrane Trials, Scopus and Science Direct) were systematically searched in July 2017 for studies reporting non-antibiotic measures to prevent UTIs in pregnancy. The terms ("urinary tract infection" or UTI or bacteriuria or cystitis) AND (prevention) AND (pregnan*) were used. The quality of the publications was appraised using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) checklists for cohort study, case-control study and randomised controlled trial. The results were synthesised using a textual narrative approach.

Results

Search results yielded 3276 publications and after reviewing titles and removing duplicates, 57 full text articles were assessed for eligibility and eight were included in the review. Five different approaches (hygiene measures, cranberry juice, immunisation, ascorbic acid and Canephron® N) have been identified, all of which are reported to be safe in pregnancy.

Conclusion

The quality of the evidence varied considerably and only hygiene measures were supported by evidence to be recommended in practice. Future work needs to concentrate on strengthening the evidence base through improved design and reporting of studies with a focus on immunisation, ascorbic acid and Canephron® N.

### FDA announces health claim for certain cranberry… [^114DCdn9]. FDA (2020). Medium credibility.

Based on the FDA's review, the agency concluded that there is limited and inconsistent credible scientific evidence to support a qualified health claim for the consumption of cranberry juice beverages and limited credible scientific evidence to support a qualified health claim for the consumption of cranberry dietary supplements and a reduced risk of recurrent UTI in healthy women. Specifically, the FDA intends to exercise its enforcement discretion regarding claims for the association between consumption of cranberry juice beverages containing at least 27 percent cranberry juice and cranberry dietary supplements containing at least 500 milligrams of cranberry fruit powder and a reduced risk of recurrent UTI. The claims do not include other conventional foods or food products made from or containing cranberries, such as dried cranberries or cranberry sauce.

The following qualified health claims are included in the FDA's letter of enforcement discretion: For cranberry juice beverages
- "Limited and inconsistent scientific evidence shows that by consuming one serving each day of a cranberry juice beverage, healthy women who have had a urinary tract infection may reduce their risk of recurrent UTI. "
- "Consuming one serving each day of a cranberry juice beverage may help reduce the risk of recurrent urinary tract infection in healthy women. FDA has concluded that the scientific evidence supporting this claim is limited and inconsistent".
- "Consuming one serving each day of may help reduce the risk of recurrent urinary tract infection in healthy women. FDA has concluded that the scientific evidence supporting this claim is limited and inconsistent. " For cranberry dietary supplements.
- "Limited scientific evidence shows that by consuming 500 mg each day of cranberry dietary supplement, healthy women who have had a urinary tract infection may reduce their risk of recurrent UTI. "
- "Consuming 500 mg each day of cranberry dietary supplement may help reduce the risk of recurrent urinary tract infection in healthy women. FDA has concluded that there is limited scientific evidence supporting this claim".

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^113CURLY]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Recurrent urinary tract infection (rUTI) prophylaxis — cranberry randomized controlled trials (RCTs) show benefit in select populations. Two recent RCTs (N = 218) investigated cranberry prophylaxis. In one, Rondanelli et al. randomized 46 women older than 70 years of age with diabetes taking an SGLT-2 inhibitor to a standardized cranberry extract or placebo, and the UTI rate in the intervention group was a third of that in placebo (3% versus 9%) with no adverse events or safety concerns. In another, Tsiakoulias et al. randomized 172 females with rUTI to a high dose proanthocyanidins (PAC) cranberry supplement (240 mg/day) or placebo, and UTIs were significantly fewer with intervention (IRR: 0.49; p < 0.001) with slight quality-of-life improvement; across new studies, rates of adverse events were low and did not differ between groups.

### The epidemiology of urinary tract infection [^113KDEcE]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2010). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are among the most common bacterial infections acquired in the community and in hospitals. In individuals without anatomical or functional abnormalities, UTIs are generally self limiting, but have a propensity to recur. Uropathogens have specialized characteristics, such as the production of adhesins, siderophores and toxins that enable them to colonize and invade the urinary tract, and are transmitted between individuals both through person-to-person contact and possibly via food or water. Although generally self limiting, treatment of UTIs with antibiotics leads to a more rapid resolution of symptoms and is more likely to clear bacteriuria, but also selects for resistant uropathogens and commensal bacteria and adversely affects the gut and vaginal microbiota. As uropathogens are increasingly becoming resistant to currently available antibiotics, it may be time to explore alternative strategies for managing UTI.

### Cranberries for preventing urinary tract infections [^117PZRV4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Cranberries (particularly in the form of cranberry juice) have been used widely for several decades for the prevention and treatment of urinary tract infections (UTIs). The aim of this review is to assess the effectiveness of cranberries in preventing such infections.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of cranberry juice and other cranberry products in preventing UTIs in susceptible populations.

Search Strategy

Electronic databases and the Internet were searched using English and non English language terms; companies involved with the promotion and distribution of cranberry preparations were contacted; reference lists of review articles and relevant trials were searched.

Selection Criteria

All randomised or quasi randomised controlled trials of cranberry juice/products for the prevention of urinary tract infections in susceptible populations. Trials of men, women or children were included.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently assessed and extracted information. For each included trial, information was collected on methods, participants, interventions and outcomes (urinary tract infections (symptomatic and asymptomatic), side effects and adherence to therapy). We were unable to perform statistical analysis due to the nature of the data available for review, so a narrative synthesis was undertaken. Quality was assessed using the Cochrane criteria.

Main Results

Five trials met the inclusion criteria (four cross-over, one parallel group). Four compared the effectiveness of cranberry juice versus placebo juice or water, and one compared the effectiveness of cranberry capsules versus placebo. Two further trials were excluded. Data from two out of the five trials indicated that cranberries were effective for either symptomatic or asymptomatic UTIs, but this result was not obtained in an intention-to-treat analysis. Side effects were common, and dropouts high. Overall, the quality of the five included trials was poor, the sample sizes were small, and thus the reliability of the results must be questionable.

Reviewer's Conclusions

The small number of poor quality trials gives no reliable evidence of the effectiveness of cranberry juice and other cranberry products. The large number of dropouts/withdrawals from the trials indicates that cranberry juice may not be acceptable over long periods of time. There is no conclusive evidence to recommend cranberry juice for the prevention of UTIs. Further properly designed trials with relevant outcomes are needed.

### Whole cranberry fruit powder supplement reduces the incidence of culture-confirmed urinary tract infections in females with a history of recurrent urinary tract infection: a 6-month multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^116UFxK8]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2025). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, the present study provides robust evidence that among females with recurrent UTI, consumption of whole cranberry fruit powder (500 mg/d Pacran) capsules, compared with placebo, does not impact safety markers and reduces the incidence of culture-confirmed UTI supported by improvements in several other UTI-related outcomes.

### A review for clinical practice in the treatment and prevention of recurrent urinary tract infections in women over age 65 [^113ZsabT]. Journal of Women's Health (2024). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a pervasive, costly, and dangerous cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, which can lead to further complications if they become recurrent or progress to urosepsis. Recurrent UTI is a particular concern among postmenopausal females because of increased risk factors and decreased estrogen levels, leading to changes in the urogenital epithelium and subsequently causing alterations in the urogenital microbiome. Prevention strategies for recurrent UTIs are often incorporated into patient-centered care plans, but finding the right management can be difficult for older women since many of the common treatment options have contraindications and adverse side effects. This review aims to describe the diagnosis, treatment, and special considerations for the treatment and prevention of recurrent UTIs in women over 65. Current prevention strategies include both antibiotic and nonantibiotic options. The antibiotic choice for older women presents a few unique challenges, including frequent allergy or intolerance of side effects, renal or liver dysfunction, and polypharmacy or drug interactions. Nonantibiotic options range from readily accessible drugstore remedies to experimental vaccines, which all are accompanied by certain advantages and disadvantages. Appropriate management plans can help to reduce symptoms and poor outcomes among older females. In addition, we hope future studies continue to investigate the proper dosing and routes for optimal management in this aging female population.

### Urinary tract infections cranberry juice, underwear, and probiotics in the 21st century [^111KxsN7]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

There is a substantial gap between the viewpoint of urologists and the rest of society regarding UTIs. Urologists spend little time and effort thinking about UTIs. In contrast, UTIs are a major issue for many women. There is substantial concern about "natural compounds" and probiotics that allow women to take charge of their health care. It is easy to understand this concern because UTIs are common, costly, and cause considerable morbidity.

### Recurrent urinary tract infections in women [^114TV6QX]. International Urogynecology Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction and Hypothesis

Recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs) are more common in women and are frequently defined as ≥ 2 episodes in the last 6 months or ≥ 3 episodes in the last 12 months. In a primary care setting, 53% of women above the age of 55 years and 36% of younger women report a recurrence within 1 year. Thus, management and prevention of recurrent UTI is of utmost significance. This review aims to highlight the latest research in prevention strategies and suggest a management pathway.

Methods

A search was conducted on MEDLINE, Embase and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews databases for the latest systematic reviews and high-quality randomized controlled trials. Special emphasis was placed on the remit "recurrent" and strongly adhered to. Furthermore, a Google search was conducted for current guidelines on the management of UTIs.

Results

Current prevention strategies include eliminating risk factors that increase the risk of acquiring recurrent UTI and continuous, post-coital and self-initiated antimicrobial prophylaxis. Other prospective preventative strategies, currently under trial, include use of vaccinations, D-mannose and lactobacillus (probiotics).

Conclusion

Although risk factors should be identified and addressed accordingly, individualized antibiotic prophylaxis remains the most effective method of management. Non-antibiotic prevention strategies such as cranberry, vitamin C and methenamine salts lack strong evidence to be introduced as routine management options and as alternatives to antibiotics. Based on current evidence and guidelines, a management pathway is recommended. Emerging therapies require further evaluation before they can be recommended.

### Effectiveness of cranberry capsules to prevent urinary tract infections in vulnerable older persons: a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial in long-term care facilities [^113VDesj]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2014). Low credibility.

Effectiveness

A systematic review showed that cranberry-containing products were associated with a protective effect against UTI in certain populations. A Cochrane review reported a UTI reduction of 35% (95% CI = 10–54%). In the recent update of this Cochrane review in 2012, the authors performed a meta-analysis based on two studies evaluating cranberry in elderly adults (N = 413). Cranberry did not significantly reduce UTI in this population (risk ratio = 0.75, 95% CI = 0.39–1.44). In contrast with this last review, the current study found a positive effect of treatment with cranberry capsules on the incidence of clinically diagnosed UTI in 516 older persons with high UTI risk. A possible explanation for this difference could be the product used (juice vs capsules), study population (hospitalized vs institutionalized), and sample size. Another study comparing cranberry with low-dose trimethoprim (follow-up 6 months) showed no difference between cranberry and low-dose antibiotics but did not include a placebo arm.

It could have been expected that the beneficial effect of cranberry capsules would be fairly prompt after starting treatment, but the current study showed a beneficial effect of cranberry capsules in the high-UTI-risk group starting from 2 months of treatment on for clinically defined UTI. This was shown in an earlier study that found a reduction that started between 1 and 2 months after initiating cranberry juice and remained stable throughout the 6 months of follow-up. Cranberries with PAC were expected to have an effect by different mechanisms, because they influence the adhesive capacity of fimbriae of bacteria and build a biofilm on the surface, preventing adhesion. Nevertheless, bacteria could be persistent (chronic bacteriuria), and the types of bacteria could vary over time. So cranberry protects against UTI, but it takes some time to have an effect.

Because the effect of preventive care depends on the incidence of the disease, a preplanned stratification was made at baseline on baseline UTI risk. Based on the literature, LTCF residents with diabetes mellitus,–long-term catheterization, or UTI in the preceding year, were considered to be at high risk. Although a group of LTCF residents with a high incidence were selected using these criteria, it might be that other criteria would have selected a group with even higher risks or more preventable UTIs.

### Whole cranberry fruit powder supplement reduces the incidence of culture-confirmed urinary tract infections in females with a history of recurrent urinary tract infection: a 6-month multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^113KFBtW]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled 6-mo clinical intervention trial in females with rUTI demonstrated that daily consumption of whole cranberry fruit powder reduced the risk of culture-confirmed UTI compared with placebo. Consistent findings were also observed for several UTI-related secondary outcomes, and the supplement was reported to be safe for consumption.

The results from the current study are similar to previous randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses of these trials, which investigated the effects of cranberry in various forms compared with placebo/control on UTI incidence in females with rUTI. Although the effects from these studies differed in magnitude and level of statistical significance, the direction of effects was generally toward protection against rUTI, with the exception of Barbosa-Cesnik, which showed higher rUTI rates in the cranberry than the placebo group. This latter study differed from other studies in that they enrolled females presenting at clinic with acute UTI rather than a history of rUTI, used a lower bacteria threshold to define UTI (10³ cfu/mL), and additionally used juice as the placebo, which although it did not contain cranberry, may have inadvertently contained similar active ingredients to those found in cranberry juice such as ascorbic acid. Studies that enrolled mixed sex or pooled participants with complicated and uncomplicated UTIs generally reported no effect of cranberry products compared with placebo, likely due to complexities associated with UTI in males and complicated UTIs requiring different treatments.

The criteria for defining rUTI differed across studies. Although the current study defined rUTI as ≥ 2 UTIs in the past 6 mo or ≥ 3 UTIs in the past year as recommended, others used lower rates of ≥ 1 in the past 6 mo or ≥ 2 in the past year. Despite differences in inclusion criteria all studies reported reduced rates of UTI with cranberry products compared with placebo. However, results may be sensitive to the exclusion of participants with a history of higher number of UTIs (> 5 UTIs in the past 6 or 12 mo). Babar et al. used similar inclusion criteria as the current study (≥ 2 UTIs in the past 6 mo or ≥ 3 UTIs in the past year) and did not show an overall significant reduction in UTI incidence. However, they did detect a significant reduction in a subgroup of females with a history of < 5 UTIs in the preceding year. Thus, excluding participants with > 5 UTIs in the past 6 mo, as in the current study, may be an important criterion.
