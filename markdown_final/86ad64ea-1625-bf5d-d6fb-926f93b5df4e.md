## Question

What is the formulary for injectable of vitamin B 12?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the formulary for injectable vitamin B12. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "formulary" means in this context and whether the user is asking about available products, dosing regimens, or both. Then, I should verify the active forms of injectable B12 and their labeled indications. Next, I will review dosing protocols by clinical scenario, including without neurologic involvement, with neurologic involvement, and special populations. After that, I should check product availability, strengths, excipients, and storage. Finally, I will synthesize a concise, clinically actionable summary and note any controversies or exceptions that might alter practice decisions.

> Let me first confirm the scope so I don't miss anything. "Formulary" here could refer to the list of available injectable B12 products, their formulations, and the dosing regimens used in practice; I will address both the product landscape and the dosing protocols, and I should explicitly distinguish cyanocobalamin from hydroxocobalamin because availability and dosing differ by region and indication [^5294ccdc] [^fa54d9be].

> I need to check the active forms and labeled uses. Cyanocobalamin is the most commonly used injectable form in the U.S. and is indicated for treatment and diagnosis of vitamin B12 deficiency, with rapid absorption after IM/SC injection and peak plasma levels within about 1 hour; hydroxocobalamin is also indicated for B12 deficiency and is preferred in some regions and special circumstances, though in the U.S. it is best known as a cyanide antidote rather than a routine B12 replacement product [^5294ccdc] [^fa54d9be] [^16694ff8].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about dosing; I should verify protocols by clinical scenario. For adults with B12 deficiency without neurologic involvement, a standard U.S. regimen is 100 mcg IM or SC daily for 6–7 days, then every other day for 7 doses if there is a response, then every 3–4 days for 2–3 weeks, followed by maintenance 100 mcg monthly; this is the FDA-labeled cyanocobalamin regimen and aligns with primary care guidance to consider injectables in severe deficiency or when rapid correction is desired [^2d8ec6f1] [^cd70807b] [^3135f7d4].

> Wait, let me verify the approach when neurologic symptoms are present, because undertreatment risks irreversible injury. With neurologic involvement, many guidelines favor more aggressive parenteral therapy; for example, British guidance recommends 1,000 mcg IM every 2 days until no further improvement, then 1,000 mcg every 2 months, while AAFP advises parenteral therapy early in patients with neurologic symptoms; I initially thought the FDA label endorsed 1,000 mcg IM every 2 days, but that is not correct — the FDA labeling details the 100 mcg regimen, so the higher-dose, more frequent IM approach is guideline-based rather than FDA-labeled, and I should correct that distinction here [^2cfa5690] [^91827e2d] [^2d8ec6f1].

> I should confirm special populations and contexts. In pregnancy, cyanocobalamin is generally acceptable across trimesters, but injectable formulations contain benzyl alcohol, which is associated with gasping syndrome in premature infants, so risk–benefit discussion and preservative-aware choices are prudent; in patients with malabsorption or after bariatric surgery, parenteral therapy is preferred and often required long term; in smokers or those with suspected cyanide exposure risk, hydroxocobalamin is favored because it is a cyanide scavenger; in renal insufficiency, some experts advise avoiding cyanocobalamin due to impaired cyanide clearance and prefer methylcobalamin, though high-quality comparative data are limited, so I should flag this as controversial and individualized [^49ddc507] [^3c216fb8] [^080c4271] [^3ed7b090] [^286c3b17] [^46f44c9b].

> Next, I should review product availability and formulation details. Cyanocobalamin injection is available as 1,000 mcg/mL in 1 mL single-dose vials and 10 mL and 30 mL multiple-dose vials; typical excipients include sodium chloride and benzyl alcohol, with pH adjusted to about 4.5–7.0; storage is at controlled room temperature with protection from light; some kits include alcohol pads, syringes, and needles, but I need to ensure I don't overgeneralize kit contents across manufacturers [^a945fc18] [^32c38909] [^79e4e8bd] [^988451c2].

> Let me consider administration nuances and safety. IM and SC routes are both acceptable and have similar pharmacokinetics; peak levels occur within about 1 hour and a large fraction of administered dose is excreted in urine within 48 hours, which explains why high-dose regimens are reasonable in deficiency states; I should also remember warnings about anaphylaxis, hypokalemia during intense correction of severe megaloblastic anemia, and the risk of masking folate deficiency, and I should double-check that these are consistently reflected in labeling and guidelines [^5294ccdc] [^aee46a4c] [^b3225c68].

> But wait, what if oral therapy could suffice in some cases; I should acknowledge that evidence base. High-dose oral cyanocobalamin can be effective in many patients, including some with pernicious anemia, due to passive absorption, yet guidelines still prioritize parenteral therapy in severe deficiency, malabsorption, or neurologic disease; this helps frame shared decision-making when patients prefer to avoid injections or when access is limited [^a2861784] [^0619db39] [^9f69ce42].

> I will now examine the hydroxocobalamin side of the formulary briefly. Hydroxocobalamin is available as a 1,000 mcg/mL injection and is indicated for B12 deficiency as well as for cyanide poisoning; dosing for deficiency is often 1,000 mcg IM every 2–3 months after loading in some protocols, though regional practices vary, and its longer half-life can be advantageous in certain maintenance scenarios; I should confirm that when used for cyanide, the dosing is entirely different and unrelated to B12 deficiency treatment [^fa54d9be] [^14de98d5].

> Let me synthesize a practical, clinically oriented summary. The core injectable B12 formulary centers on cyanocobalamin 1,000 mcg/mL multidose vials for IM/SC use, with a standard adult regimen of 100 mcg daily for 6–7 days, then every other day for 7 doses, then every 3–4 days for 2–3 weeks, followed by 100 mcg monthly maintenance; in neurologic disease or severe deficiency, many clinicians escalate to 1,000 mcg IM every 2–3 days until improvement plateaus, then taper to maintenance every 1–2 months; hydroxocobalamin 1,000 mcg/mL is an alternative, particularly in smokers or when cyanide exposure risk is a concern, and product selection should account for excipients, storage, and patient-specific contraindications [^2d8ec6f1] [^cd70807b] [^2cfa5690] [^3ed7b090].

> Finally, I should confirm key caveats so we don't overgeneralize. Evidence for exact dosing frequencies is limited and interindividual variability is substantial, so some patients require more frequent injections to remain asymptomatic; benzyl alcohol preservatives warrant caution in neonates and may be avoided by selecting preservative-free options when available; and while oral therapy can work in many patients, parenteral therapy remains the most reliable in malabsorption and neurologic disease, which justifies its prominent place in the injectable "formulary" for B12 replacement [^f971644f] [^286c3b17] [^a2861784].

Injectable vitamin B12 is available as **cyanocobalamin 1,000 mcg/mL** [^a945fc18] in 1 mL single-dose vials and 10 mL or 30 mL multiple-dose vials [^79e4e8bd]; hydroxocobalamin is less common in the U.S. but is used in some regions [^e10cd858]. Typical dosing is **100 mcg IM/SC daily for 6–7 days** [^2d8ec6f1], then every other day for 7 doses, then every 3–4 days for 2–3 weeks, then 100 mcg monthly for maintenance [^cd70807b]; for neurological involvement, 1,000 mcg IM every 2–3 days until improvement, then monthly [^2cfa5690]. Store at 20–25°C, protect from light, and monitor for rare hypersensitivity or hypokalemia [^a945fc18] [^aee46a4c].

## Available formulations and strengths

Injectable vitamin B12 is available primarily as **cyanocobalamin**, with hydroxocobalamin used in some regions [^e10cd858].

| **Formulation** | **Strength** | **Presentation** |
|-|-|-|
| Cyanocobalamin | 1,000 mcg/mL | - 1 mL single-dose vials <br/> - 10 mL multiple-dose vials <br/> - 30 mL multiple-dose vials [^a945fc18] [^79e4e8bd] |
| Hydroxocobalamin | 1,000 mcg/mL | - 1 mL ampules <br/> - 10 mL vials (availability varies by region) |

---

## Clinical indications

Injectable vitamin B12 is indicated for **deficiency due to malabsorption** (pernicious anemia, post-gastrectomy, celiac disease, pancreatic insufficiency, small bowel bacterial overgrowth) [^fef49851], dietary deficiency (strict veganism), and neurological involvement (subacute combined degeneration, peripheral neuropathy) [^2cfa5690]. It is also used when oral therapy is ineffective or not tolerated [^a2861784].

---

## Recommended dosing regimens

Dosing depends on severity, cause, and presence of neurological symptoms:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Initial dosing** | **Maintenance dosing** |
|-|-|-|
| Without neurological involvement | 100 mcg IM/SC daily for 6–7 days, then every other day for 7 doses, then every 3–4 days for 2–3 weeks [^2d8ec6f1] | 100 mcg IM/SC monthly [^cd70807b] |
| With neurological involvement | 1,000 mcg IM every 2–3 days until improvement ceases (typically 10–12 weeks) [^2cfa5690] | 1,000 mcg IM monthly thereafter |
| Pernicious anemia | 100 mcg IM/SC daily for 6–7 days, then every other day for 7 doses, then every 3–4 days for 2–3 weeks [^2d8ec6f1] | 100 mcg IM/SC monthly for life [^cd70807b] |

---

## Administration techniques

- **Intramuscular (IM) injection**: Preferred for rapid absorption; deltoid or gluteal sites are commonly used.
- **Subcutaneous (SC) injection**: Alternative when IM is contraindicated; absorption is slower but steady [^5294ccdc].
- **Intravenous (IV) injection**: Not recommended due to rapid renal excretion and reduced hepatic storage [^5294ccdc].

---

## Storage and stability

Store at **20–25°C (68–77°F)** with excursions permitted to 15–30°C (59–86°F); protect from light [^a945fc18]. Do not freeze, and discard if discoloration or precipitation occurs.

---

## Safety considerations and adverse effects

- **Hypersensitivity reactions**: Rare anaphylaxis or allergic reactions; monitor closely [^aee46a4c].
- **Hypokalemia**: Can occur during intense therapy for severe megaloblastic anemia; monitor potassium [^b3225c68].
- **Polycythemia vera**: May be unmasked during treatment; monitor hematocrit [^b3225c68].
- **Benzyl alcohol preservative**: Avoid in neonates due to potential gasping syndrome [^286c3b17].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Assess **clinical response** by tracking hematologic improvement (CBC, reticulocyte count) and neurological symptoms [^cec3d397]. Routine B12 level monitoring is not required once stable; consider periodic checks in high-risk patients. Adjust dosing based on response and recurrence of symptoms [^8528325f].

---

Injectable vitamin B12 is available as cyanocobalamin 1,000 mcg/mL [^a945fc18] in single- and multiple-dose vials, with dosing tailored to severity and neurological involvement; **monitor for rare hypersensitivity and hypokalemia**, and store protected from light [^aee46a4c].

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Vitamin B12is essential to growth, cell reproduction, hematopoiesis, and nucleoprotein and myelin synthesis.

Cyanocobalamin is quantitatively and rapidly absorbed from intramuscular and subcutaneous sites of injection; the plasma level of the compound reaches its peak within 1 hour after intramuscular injection. Absorbed vitamin B12is transported via specific B12binding proteins, transcobalamin I and II to the various tissues. The liver is the main organ for vitamin B12storage.

Within 48 hours after injection of 100 or 1000 mcg of vitamin B12, 50 to 98% of the injected dose may appear in the urine. The major portion is excreted within the first eight hours. Intravenous administration results in even more rapid excretion with little opportunity for liver storage.

Gastrointestinal absorption of vitamin B12depends on the presence of sufficient intrinsic factor and calcium ions. Intrinsic factor deficiency causes pernicious anemia, which may be associated with subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord. Prompt parenteral administration of vitamin B12prevents progression of neurologic damage.

The average diet supplies about 5 to 15 mcg/day of vitamin B12in a protein-bound form that is available for absorption after normal digestion. Vitamin B12is not present in foods of plant origin, but is abundant in foods of animal origin. In people with normal absorption, deficiencies have been reported only in strict vegetarians who consume no products of animal origin (including no milk products or eggs).

Vitamin B12is bound to intrinsic factor during transit through the stomach; separation occurs in the terminal ileum in the presence of calcium, and vitamin B12enters the mucosal cell for absorption. It is then transported by the transcobalamin binding proteins. A small amount (approximately 1% of the total amount ingested) is absorbed by simple diffusion, but this mechanism is adequate only with very large doses. Oral absorption is considered too undependable to rely on in patients with pernicious anemia or other conditions resulting in malabsorption of vitamin B12.

Cyanocobalamin is the most widely used form of vitamin B12, and has hematopoietic activity apparently identical to that of the antianemia factor in purified liver extract. Hydroxycobalamin is equally as effective as cyanocobalamin, and they share the cobalamin molecular structure.

DESCRIPTION

Cyanocobalamin Injection (vitamin B12) is a sterile solution of Cyanocobalamin. Each mL contains Cyanocobalamin 1000 mcg, sodium chloride 9 mg and benzyl alcohol 0.015 mL in water for injection. Hydrochloric acid and/or sodium hydroxide may have been added to adjust the pH (range 4.5–7.0).

Cyanocobalamin appears as dark red crystals or as an amorphous or crystalline red powder. It is very hygroscopic in the anhydrous form, and sparingly soluble in water (1:80). It is stable to autoclaving for short periods at 121°C. The vitamin B12coenzymes are very unstable in light.

The chemical name is 5,6-dimethyl-benzimidazolyl cyanocobamide; the molecular formula is C63H88CoN14O14P. The cobalt content is 4.34%. The molecular weight is 1355.39.

The structural formula is represented below.

### Oral or intramuscular vitamin B12? [^e10cd858]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2009). Low credibility.

Vitamin B(12) deficiency is common, becoming more so with age, and estimates of its population prevalence have ranged from 1.5% to 15%. If untreated, it can lead to megaloblastic anaemia and irreversible neurological complications. In the UK, the usual treatment is regular intramuscular injections of hydroxocobalamin. High-dose oral vitamin B(12) replacement is standard practice in some other countries and less costly. Here we review issues around adopting an oral vitamin B(12) replacement regimen more widely in the UK.

### Synopsis of the 2020 U.S. VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the management of adult overweight and obesity [^8c297fcd]. Military Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Cyanocobalamin (vitamin B-12) and weight loss: Vitamin B-12 has a very limited role in promoting weight loss, and there are no studies evaluating weight loss with vitamin B-12 injections, tablets, sublingual pills, or drinks. Conversely, B-12 deficiency has been associated with weight loss, particularly after bariatric surgical procedures, and can lead to permanent nerve damage if left untreated; no weight loss should be anticipated as a result of the use of exogenous vitamin B-12, injection site reaction might be anticipated if that route is chosen, and in patients with normal renal function a hypervitaminosis state is unlikely.

### Comparing the efficacy and tolerability of a new daily oral vitamin B12 formulation and intermittent intramuscular vitamin B12 in normalizing low cobalamin levels: a randomized, open-label, parallel-group study [^3183a3dc]. Clinical Therapeutics (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Vitamin B(12) deficiency is routinely treated with parenteral dosing and less often with high-dose oral vitamin B(12). Oral vitamin B(12) formulations have low bioavailability in patients with malabsorption and are considered less reliable than parenteral treatments.

Objective

The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety profile of a new proprietary oral vitamin B(12) formulation (oral B(12)) with intramuscular (IM) vitamin B(12) (IM B(12)) in restoring normal serum B(12) concentrations in patients with low cobalamin levels (< 350 pg/mL).

Methods

Patients were recruited from 5 centers and randomly assigned to receive oral B(12) 1000 μg, taken daily for 90 days, or IM B(12) 1000 μg, given on study days 1, 3, 7, 10, 14, 21, 30, 60, and 90. The patients were aged ≥ 60 years or aged ≥ 18 years and had gastrointestinal abnormalities or were on a restricted diet. The primary efficacy outcome compared the proportion of patients in each treatment arm in whom cobalamin levels were normalized (≥ 350 ng/mL) following 60 days of treatment. Secondary objectives included comparing the efficacy of the 2 formulations after 90 days of treatment, assessing time to normalization of B(12) levels, and evaluating the changes in the levels of biomarkers methylmalonic acid (MMA) and homocysteine (HC). The effect on holotranscobalamin II (active B(12)) levels was assessed as an exploratory end point and correlated to serum cobalamin levels in both treatment groups. Blood samples were collected at baseline (day 1) and on days 15, 31, 61, and 91.

Results

Fifty patients were recruited. Forty-eight patients (96.0%) completed the study (22 patients [91.7%] in the oral B(12) group and 26 patients [100%] in the IM B(12) group). All patients (100%) in both treatment groups and in both populations had a cobalamin level ≥ 350 pg/mL on day 61 and maintained it on day 91. The difference between the IM and oral treatment groups did not reach the planned level of statistical significance (P < 0.05) for mean percent change from baseline (PCFB) in serum cobalamin levels on day 61 and day 91. The difference between the IM and oral treatment groups did not reach the planned level of statistical significance for mean PCFB in serum MMA levels on day 61. There was a statistical difference between the IM and oral treatment groups for mean PCFB in serum MMA levels on day 91 (P = 0.033), with lower values in the oral B(12) group. The difference between the IM and oral treatment groups did not reach the planned level of statistical significance for mean PCFB in plasma HC levels on day 61 and day 91. All patients in each treatment group achieved normalization of serum cobalamin levels by day 15. All patients in both treatment groups and in both populations had plasma holotranscobalamin levels ≥ 40 pmol/L on day 61 and on day 91. No statistical analysis was planned or performed for safety end points, which were reported only descriptively. Most observed adverse effects were considered mild or moderate in intensity. All adverse effects that were considered severe in intensity were also considered by the investigator to be not related to the study drug.

Conclusions

In this selected study population comprising individuals with low cobalamin levels but who otherwise were in good health, patients received oral B(12) (1000 μg/d) or IM B(12) (1000 μg in 9 injections over 3 months) for a total of 3 months. Both the oral and IM formulations were effective in restoring normal levels of serum cobalamin in all patients studied (100%). Both formulations used in this study were well tolerated at the dose studied. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01312831.

Vitamin B12 — replacement routes and special situations: Very large doses of sublingual or oral crystalline B12 (500–1000 mcg/d) are ≈1% absorbed by mass action even if IF is absent, and the sublingual and oral routes seem equally effective and may be preferred to a monthly intramuscular injection. In patients with tobacco amblyopia or B12 deficiency who smoke, increased urinary thiocyanate losses mean they should receive hydroxocobalamin, which is a potent cyanide antagonist; this compound is currently available only in parenteral form. Cyanocobalamin, the traditional salt, is used in oral, sublingual, and parenteral multivitamin formulations.

How cost effective is B 12?

Oral cyanocobalamin is cost effective for treating diet related B 12 deficiency. A hydroxocobalamin vial for parenteral administration containing 1000 mcg costs less than £1. The main costs of intramuscular B 12 therapy are associated with the administration of the injection itself, when this is done by a nurse specialist or GP. Many patients have successfully learnt to self-administer B 12 by intramuscular injection, which reduces both healthcare costs and burden on GP practices, and allows people who are B 12 deficient to optimise their treatment regimen.

Case example

A man in his 70s presents with a nine month history of difficulty walking and climbing stairs, numbness and pain in his lower limbs, and paraesthesia in his hands. He received a diagnosis of B 12 deficiency 10 years ago, and during the covid-19 pandemic he switched from intramuscular hydroxocobalamin 1000 mcg once monthly to oral B 12 supplementation. At the current presentation he has serum B 12 (209 pmol/L), which is within the normal range (148–600 pmol/L), however MMA is elevated at 1100 nmol/L (a measurement taken in 2017 was 117 nmol/L, normal < 300 nmol/L). He had no other haematological abnormalities at initial presentation or at his current relapse. Hydroxocobalamin injections are resumed twice weekly (self-administrated) because of the severity of the neuropathy. It takes more than 12 months for his symptoms to resolve.

Tips for patients.

If you have limited dietary intake of B 12 and experience symptoms listed in box 1, you might have B 12 deficiency.
Consider regular oral supplementation if you have a limited dietary intake of B 12 or are taking medications that interfere with B 12 absorption.
Where possible, avoid suddenly reducing the B 12 dose or injection frequency, as too rapid dose reduction may worsen symptoms or lead to symptom recurrence. Instead, gradually increase the interval between B 12 injections over the course of several months while monitoring symptoms.
If you require regular intramuscular B 12 injections, consider being taught how to self-administer these.
Consider creating an individualised treatment plan with the support of your doctor tailored to help you become or remain symptom-free (dose and frequency will vary between individuals from twice weekly to once every two to three months).

How is B 12 deficiency treated?

The therapeutic goals of B 12 treatment are the reversal of metabolic abnormalities and the prevention or reduction of clinical symptoms (fig 1). Treatment depends in part on the severity of symptoms and the cause of the deficiency. In individuals with symptomatic B 12 deficiency despite normal dietary B 12 intake, B 12 malabsorption is the most likely cause and should guide parenteral therapy.

The three key treatment areas are outlined below.

Insufficient dietary intake

To prevent deficiency, oral cyanocobalamin supplementation once daily 20–50 mcg or 50–150 mcg is most commonly recommended. In some countries, methyl- and adenosylcobalamin-containing preparations are available; however, one observational study suggests better efficacy with cyanocobalamin than with methylcobalamin. Exercise caution when using combination preparations to avoid excessive folate or B 6 intake. With advancing age, B 12 absorption declines, and a higher supplemental B 12 dose may be needed. Yearly monitoring of B 12 status and suitable adjustment of the supplementation dose is recommended.

For symptomatic deficiency (box 1) caused by insufficient dietary intake, intramuscular B 12 therapy is usually initiated with the aim of progressing to oral supplements once symptoms have resolved.

PRECAUTIONS

General Precautions: Vitamin B12deficiency that is allowed to progress for longer than 3 months may produce permanent degenerative lesions of the spinal cord. Doses of folic acid greater than 0.1 mg per day may result in hematologic remission in patients with vitamin B1 deficiency. Neurologic manifestations will not be prevented with folic acid, and if not treated with vitamin B, irreversible damage will result.

Doses of cyanocobalamin exceeding 10 mcg daily may produce hematologic response in patients with folate deficiency. Indiscriminate administration may mask the true diagnosis.

Information for Patients: Patients with pernicious anemia should be informed that they will require monthly injections of vitamin B12for the remainder of their lives. Failure to do so will result in return of the anemia and in development of incapacitating and irreversible damage to the nerves of the spinal cord. Also, patients should be warned about the danger of taking folic acid in place of vitamin B12, because the former may prevent anemia but allow progression of subacute combined degeneration.

A vegetarian diet which contains no animal products (including milk products or eggs) does not supply any vitamin B12. Patients following such a diet should be advised to take oral vitamin B12regularly. The need for vitamin B12is increased by pregnancy and lactation. Deficiency has been recognized in infants of vegetarian mothers who were breast fed, even though the mothers had no symptoms of deficiency at the time.

### Oral vitamin B12 versus intramuscular vitamin B12 for vitamin B12 deficiency [^9f69ce42]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Vitamin B12 deficiency is common and rises with age. Most people with vitamin B12 deficiency are treated in primary care with intramuscular vitamin B12 which is a considerable source of work for health care professionals. Several case control and case series studies have reported equal efficacy of oral administration of vitamin B12 but it is rarely prescribed in this form, other than in Sweden and Canada. Doctors may not be prescribing oral formulations because they are unaware of this option or have concerns regarding effectiveness.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of oral vitamin B12 versus intramuscular vitamin B12 for vitamin B12 deficiency.

Search Strategy

Searches were undertaken of The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE and Lilacs in early 2005. The bibliographies of all relevant papers identified using this strategy were searched. In addition we contacted authors of relevant identified studies and Vitamin B12 research and pharmaceutical companies to enquire about other published or unpublished studies and ongoing trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) examining the use of oral or intramuscular vitamin B12 to treat vitamin B12 deficiency.

Data Collection and Analysis

All abstracts or titles identified by the electronic searches were independently scrutinised by two reviewers. When a difference between reviewers arose, we obtained and reviewed a hard copy of the papers and made decisions by consensus. We obtained a copy of all pre-selected papers and two researchers independently extracted the data from these studies using piloted data extraction forms. The whole group checked whether inclusion and exclusion criteria were met, and disagreement was decided by consensus. The methodological quality of the included studies was independently assessed by two researchers and disagreements were brought back to the whole group and resolved by consensus.

Main Results

Two RCT's comparing oral with intramuscular administration of vitamin B12 met our inclusion criteria. The trials recruited a total of 108 participants and followed up 93 of these from 90 days to four months. High oral doses of B12 (1000 mcg and 2000 mcg) were as effective as intramuscular administration in achieving haematological and neurological responses.

Authors' Conclusions

The evidence derived from these limited studies suggests that 2000 mcg doses of oral vitamin B12 daily and 1000 mcg doses initially daily and thereafter weekly and then monthly may be as effective as intramuscular administration in obtaining short term haematological and neurological responses in vitamin B12 deficient patients.

### Treatment of vitamin b (12)-deficiency anemia: oral versus parenteral therapy [^0086fc69]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the use of oral cyanocobalamin therapy in the treatment of cobalamin (vitamin B(12))-deficient anemia.

Data Sources

Primary and review articles were identified by MEDLINE search (1966-May 2000) and through secondary sources.

Data Synthesis

Cobalamin-deficient anemia is among the most common diagnoses in older populations. Cobalamin-deficient anemia may be diagnosed as pernicious anemia, resulting from the lack of intrinsic factor required for cobalamin absorption or as protein malabsorption from the inability to displace cobalamin from protein food sources. Several studies provide evidence that daily oral cyanocobalamin as opposed to monthly parenteral formulations may adequately treat both types of cobalamin-deficient anemias.

Conclusions

Daily oral cyanocobalamin at doses of 1000–2000 microg can be used for treatment in most cobalamin-deficient patients who can tolerate oral supplementation. There are inadequate data at the present time to support the use of oral cyanocobalamin replacement in patients with severe neurologic involvement.

### Pharmacokinetics of oral cyanocobalamin formulated with sodium N-[8-(2-hydroxybenzoyl) amino] caprylate (SNAC): an open-label, randomized, single-dose, parallel-group study in healthy male subjects [^b499524a]. Clinical Therapeutics (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Vitamin B12 (cobalamin) deficiency may be caused by inadequate dietary intake of B12 or by conditions that result in malabsorption of the vitamin. Crystalline vitamin B12, usually in the form of cyanocobalamin, is administered parenterally (ie, intramuscularly) or orally for treating deficiency states. Intramuscular administration is widely accepted as a treatment method. Oral B12 supplementation is also used, but it is considered to be less reliable.

Objective

This study was conducted to compare the pharmacokinetics and tolerability of 2 oral formulations of cyanocobalamin-a marketed cyanocobalamin tablet (immediate-release B12 5 mg) and cyanocobalamin formulated with a proprietary carrier, sodium N-[8-(2-hydroxybenzoyl)amino]caprylate (SNAC)-to establish the feasibility of using an absorption enhancer with B12 to improve uptake of the vitamin. This was the first clinical study conducted with the cyanocobalamin/SNAC coformulation.

Methods

An open-label, randomized, single-dose, parallel-group study was conducted in healthy male subjects. Subjects were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 treatment groups: Treatment A subjects (n = 4) received 2 tablets of 5-mg cyanocobalamin formulated with 100-mg SNAC as part of a dose range-finding arm included to determine a dose to provide a measurable concentration of vitamin B12 at all time points when tested with the available vitamin B12 assay; treatment B subjects (n = 6) received 1 tablet of 5-mg cyanocobalamin formulated with 100-mg SNAC; treatment C subjects (n = 6) received 1 commercially available 5-mg cyanocobalamin tablet; and treatment D subjects (n = 4) received commercially available 1-mg cyanocobalamin IV. Treatment A was completed 3 weeks before treatments B, C, and D were studied. Human serum B12 was analyzed by chemiluminescence assay method. Validation procedures established that samples could be diluted up to 100 times without any effects on accuracy and precision. The pharmacokinetic properties of vitamin B12 were characterized by noncompartmental analysis. Vitamin B12 absolute bioavailability estimates were calculated between the oral (A, B, and C) and IV (D) treatments using non-baseline-adjusted vitamin B12 concentrations as well as baseline-adjusted vitamin B12 concentrations, with or without body weight adjustments. Tolerability was evaluated through review or monitoring of medical history, physical examination findings, concomitant medications, vital signs, laboratory tests (hematology, serum chemistry, and urinalysis values), electrocardiography, adverse events, and serious adverse events.

Results

Twenty healthy male subjects, aged 20 to 45 years, participated in this study. Based on data from treatment A, a 5-mg cyanocobalamin dose was selected for use with treatments B and C. The oral cyanocobalamin formulation containing SNAC had greater mean absolute bioavailability than the commercial oral formulation (5.09% vs 2.16%, respectively), calculated on AUC(0-last) values uncorrected for baseline, weight, or body mass index. It also had a reduced T(max) compared with the commercial formulation (0.5 hours vs 6.83 hours, respectively). The K(e) was similar between treatments (0.028 1/h vs 0.025 1/h). Comparable results were achieved using corrected values. The cyanocobalamin/SNAC formulation was well tolerated, and there were no reported adverse events.

Conclusions

An oral formulation of 5-mg cyanocobalamin containing 100-mg SNAC, an absorption enhancer, provided significantly improved bioavailability and a significant decrease in T(max) for B12 in a small study of normal healthy subjects compared with a commercially available 5-mg cyanocobalamin oral formulation. Both oral formulations and commercial 1-mg cyanocobalamin IV were well tolerated.

### Vitamin B12 as a treatment for pain [^aca0a021]. Pain Physician (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

First isolated as cyanocobalamin in 1948, vitamin B12 has been explored for pain treatment almost since its discovery. With the advent of the opioid epidemic, safer treatments for pain are needed.

Objectives

Our objective was to compile the latest information on potential mechanisms from animal studies and clinical trial data on vitamin B12 for the treatment of pain conditions.

Study Design

We conducted a narrative review.

Methods

PubMed was searched using the terms "methylcobalamin pain", "hydroxycobalamin pain", "cyanocobalamin pain", and "vitamin B12 pain". Animal studies that identified mechanisms of action for the effects of pain were collected. Clinical trials utilizing larger, pharmaceutical doses of vitamin B12 (> 100 µg/dose) in pain treatment were identified and reviewed.

Results

Animal studies support multiple beneficial effects of vitamin B12 including the regeneration of nerves and the inhibition of cyclooxygenase enzymes and other pain-signaling pathways. In addition, animal studies have demonstrated synergistic benefits of vitamin B12 combined with other pain medications, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and opiates. Clinical trials provide evidence for the effectiveness of vitamin B12 for the treatment of low back pain and neuralgia, although data is still fairly limited and optimal treatment regimens have not been identified.

Limitations

More large, double-blind placebo-controlled trials are needed to fully establish efficacy and best dosing parameters.

Conclusion

Vitamin B12 may prove to be an adjunctive or integrative treatment for pain conditions. While more research is needed, considering the low incidence of side effects and overall safety, B12 may be an additional tool to consider for pain treatment.

Key Words

Vitamin B12, cyanocobalamin, methylcobalamin, hydroxycobalamin, pain, chronic pain, neuropathy, low back pain.

Tips for safer prescribing

Pregnancy and breastfeeding

Continued or new B12 therapy of women with deficiency during pregnancy and lactation is mandatory and safe.B 12 deficiency increases the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes, including early pregnancy loss, neural tube defects, pre-eclampsia, preterm birth, and low birth weight, as well as insulin resistance and adiposity. It also may lead to neurological complications in newborns, such as hypotonia, failure to thrive, central apnoeas, and seizures.

Children

Evidence based treatment advice on treatment in children is lacking; each case is judged individually. Solid evidence on the safety of parenteral, lifelong, high dose hydroxocobalamin is available from decades of treating patients with inborn errors of B 12 metabolism (eg, cobalamin C deficiency).

Symptom monitoring

Monitor symptoms regularly (eg, every two to three months) as they may reappear, even after several months, if injection frequency is reduced. Measuring serum biomarkers such as B 12 or MMA is neither helpful nor indicated in assessing or monitoring clinical improvement. Base the injection frequency on symptoms, and not on biomarker assessment.

Shared decision making

Use shared decision making to establish a long term frequency of B 12 injections for each patient and teach them how to self-inject.

### Cyanocobalamin [^6041b2d4]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY:

Vitamin B12is essential to growth, cell reproduction, hematopoiesis, and nucleoprotein and myelin synthesis.

Cyanocobalamin is quantitatively and rapidly absorbed from intramuscular and subcutaneous sites of injection; the plasma level of the compound reaches its peak within 1 hour after intramuscular injection. Absorbed vitamin B12is transported via specific B12binding proteins, transcobalamin I and II to the various tissues. The liver is the main organ for vitamin B12storage.

Within 48 hours after injection of 100 or 1000 mcg of vitamin B12, 50 to 98% of the injected dose may appear in the urine. The major portion is excreted within the first eight hours. Intravenous administration results in even more rapid excretion with little opportunity for liver storage.

Gastrointestinal absorption of vitamin B12depends on the presence of sufficient intrinsic factor and calcium ions. Intrinsic factor deficiency causes pernicious anemia, which may be associated with subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord. Prompt parenteral administration of vitamin B12prevents progression of neurologic damage.

The average diet supplies about 5 to 15 mcg/day of vitamin B12in a protein-bound form that is available for absorption after normal digestion. Vitamin B12is not present in foods of plant origin, but is abundant in foods of animal origin. In people with normal absorption, deficiencies have been reported only in strict vegetarians who consume no products of animal origin (including no milk products or eggs).

Vitamin B12is bound to intrinsic factor during transit through the stomach; separation occurs in the terminal ileum in the presence of calcium, and vitamin B12enters the mucosal cell for absorption. It is then transported by the transcobalamin binding proteins. A small amount (approximately 1% of the total amount ingested) is absorbed by simple diffusion, but this mechanism is adequate only with very large doses. Oral absorption is considered too undependable to rely on in patients with pernicious anemia or other conditions resulting in malabsorption of vitamin B12.

Cyanocobalamin is the most widely used form of vitamin B12, and has hematopoietic activity apparently identical to that of the antianemia factor in purified liver extract. Hydroxycobalamin is equally as effective as cyanocobalamin, and they share the cobalamin molecular structure.

Patient experiences

Data from a review of patient experiences and surveys involving more than 2200 patients with B 12 deficiency in the UK indicate that many patients have concerns related to healthcare quality, safety, and treatment, with nearly two thirds of respondents reporting that their treatment is insufficient to manage symptoms. Some patients may experience recurrence or worsening of symptoms when the interval between injections is extended or extended too quickly, and report that continuation of frequent intramuscular hydroxocobalamin injections, varying between twice weekly and once every three to four weeks, is needed to remain asymptomatic. Why certain patients require more frequent treatment is not understood.

In an online survey, almost one third of 683 participants reported cancellation of B 12 injections during the covid-19 lockdowns, with subsequent worsening of symptoms and often with negative emotions and feelings including anger, fear, disappointment, feeling let down, and feeling undervalued. In contrast, those who were self-administering B 12 injections or who were rapidly taught to do so reported a noticeable improvement in their symptoms and quality of life, with some benefiting from increasing the frequency of injections to suit their personal need.

What are the harms?

Strong evidence, from decades of treating individuals with inborn errors of B 12 metabolism, supports the safety of parenteral, lifelong, even high dose hydroxocobalamin, sometimes even at very high doses. Long term epidemiological studies also indicate that treatment with pharmacological B 12 doses and the corresponding increase in serum B 12 do not increase mortality. Data on the safety of cyanocobalamin, when administered with high frequency (ie, one to two times a week) for a longer period of time, are lacking.

Adverse drug reactions include skin reactions like acne or rosacea; their frequency is unknown. In our experience, some people have successfully switched to a cobalamin preparation without benzylalcohol (a preservative in some parenteral B 12 preparations) and have seen their skin problems resolve. Isolated allergy cases are reported, with some successfully treated by desensitisation. Transient hypokalaemia during initial B 12 treatment in individuals with severe anaemia is usually mild and without clinical consequences.

Contraindications

Preparations containing benzylalcohol are contraindicated for use in children and pregnant women. Cyanocobalamin is associated with worsening of visual problems, and is therefore contraindicated in people with the mitochondrial disorder Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy. Cyanocobalamin (but not hydroxocobalamin) is also contraindicated in renal insufficiency.

### A.S.P.E.N. position paper: recommendations for changes in commercially available parenteral multivitamin and multi-trace element products [^004ab446]. Nutrition in Clinical Practice (2012). Medium credibility.

Cobalamin and parenteral nutrition (PN) — In pregnancy and lactation, the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) and standard PN dosing are specified: RDA in pregnancy is 2.6 mcg B12 per day, and the usual parenteral dose of 5 mcg B12 per day exceeds this; during lactation, secretion is approximately 0.33 mcg B12 per day in breast milk, decreasing to 0.25 mcg B12 per day after 6 months, while the RDA is 2.8 mcg B12 per day with PN providing 5 mcg B12 per day. For adults, the current dose of 5 mcg/d generously meets requirements. When patients with short bowel syndrome are weaned off PN, B12 adequacy needs to be checked at interval, and if the patient smokes, hydroxocobalamin, rather than cyanocobalamin, is the compound of choice.

### Effect of combined diclofenac and B vitamins (thiamine, pyridoxine, and cyanocobalamin) for low back pain management: systematic review and meta-analysis [^6827f338]. Pain Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Methods

We compiled all available published and unpublished evidence and used premature discontinuation of medication due to complete pain relief as the primary outcome measure. Secondary outcomes included decreased pain intensity according to a visual analog scale (VAS) measure, the occurrence of adverse events (i.e.g.astrointestinal events), and participant satisfaction, based on the number of patients who described subjective improvement at the end of the study. We assessed the quality of the obtained results using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology.

Data Sources and Search Strategy

We conducted this systematic review of RCTs in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses declaration criteria and the current recommendations of the Cochrane Collaboration. We carried out searches up to June 2018 using the search terms "pain", "thiamine", "vitamin B1", "pyridoxine", "vitamin B6", "cyanocobalamin", "vitamin B12", "vitamin B complex", "Neurobion", and "diclofenac" in the following databases: MEDLINE (Ovid SP), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), EMBASE (Ovid SP), the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), the Latin American and Caribbean Health Science Information Database (LILACS), International Standard Randomized Controlled Trial Registry (ISRCTN), ClinicalTrials.gov, and the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). No language, date of publication, or completion status filters were used. In addition, we carried out a search of the references for review articles, relevant clinical trials, textbooks, and conference summaries to identify more RCTs. In all cases, we read the full-text versions of these articles. We systematically contacted the corresponding authors by e-mail if the publication contained incomplete data (i.e. data on adverse events). Although the focus of this review is LBP, we searched for pain in general, with the intention of increasing the sensitivity of the search strategy, considering that there are a lot of terms with the same meaning (i.e. back pain, lumbago, spine pain, sciatica, and dorsalgia, among others).

The search equation is found in Appendix 1. Likewise, we made additional efforts to identify RCTs that were potentially relevant to the topic using the following data sources: 1) gray literature (theses, internal reports, non-peer-reviewed journals) and 2) other unpublished sources known to experts in the specialty (obtained via personal communication).

### Vitamin B12 deficiency in patients undergoing bariatric surgery: preventive strategies and key recommendations [^3946c7d2]. Surgery for Obesity and Related Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Advances in bariatric surgery have brought about a paradigm shift in the management of obesity, with benefits extending beyond weight loss. However, nutritional deficiencies are an inherent problem in the postoperative period and often require lifelong supplementation. Vitamin B12, also referred to as cobalamin, is one of the most common micronutrient deficiencies affecting this population. This review explores the pathophysiology of cobalamin deficiency in patients undergoing bariatric surgery and provides an overview of the effectiveness of various available vitamin B12 formulations.

Methods

To identify the relevant literature, a systematic review of MEDLINE was conducted from the earliest dates through September 2012 for English-language articles describing the prevention and management of vitamin B12 deficiency in patients undergoing bariatric surgery.

Results

Intramuscular vitamin B12 continues to be the gold standard of therapy for vitamin B12 deficiency, especially in symptomatic patients. In select patients with asymptomatic vitamin B12 deficiency after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), high-dose oral cyanocobalamin should be given a consideration, especially when there are concerns with the adherence to intramuscular therapy or if compliance comes into question. Unlike patients post-RYGB, those undergoing restrictive procedures such as gastric banding and sleeve gastrectomy may be maintained postoperatively on a lower-dose daily vitamin B12 supplementation. Efficacy data of nasal and sublingual routes for maintenance therapy is currently awaited.

Conclusion

Patients undergoing bariatric surgery must be continuously educated on proper nutrition, the risk of developing significant vitamin B12 deficiency, and the role of supplements in avoiding catastrophic consequences.

Vitamin B12 requirements in parenteral nutrition — adult dose and rationale: Adult parenteral multivitamin products provide 5 mcg/d of crystalline cyanocobalamin. Serum B12 tends to be elevated in chronic parenteral nutrition, usually in the 700- to 900-pg/mL range, but there are several good reasons to continue this generous 5 mcg/d dose. Reasons include that although this dose yields serum B12 at the upper limits of normal there is no evidence for a B12 toxicity syndrome, high serum levels may reflect daily parenteral infusion rather than elevated tissue levels, parenteral B12 enters the systemic rather than portal circulation with first-pass uptake of 50% by the liver and 25% of systemic blood first passing the kidneys leading to probable urinary loss, B12 secreted into bile may not be recaptured due to loss of ileal receptors, and smokers have increased urinary B12 losses as thiocyanate.

### Diagnosis and treatment of vitamin B12 deficiency – an update [^17026fc1]. Haematologica (2006). Low credibility.

We represent an update on diagnosing and treatment of vitamin B12 deficiency. Vitamin B12 deficiency should be suspected in all patients with unexplained anaemia and/or neurological symptoms, as well as in patients at risk of developing vitamin B12 deficiency such as the elderly and patients with intestinal diseases. Measurement of plasma cobalamins is suggested as the primary analysis followed by measurement of plasma methylmalonic acid in unsettled cases. Accumulating evidence indicates that the biologically active cobalamin, plasma holotranscobalamin (holoTC), may be superior to plasma cobalamins, and measurement of holoTC is currently introduced in the clinical setting. No consensus exists concerning evaluation of the cause for vitamin B12 deficiency, and pros and cons on the different tests mainly aiming at evaluation of the function of the gastric mucosa are presented. Once the diagnosis of vitamin B12 deficiency has been confirmed efficient treatment can be ensured either by injections every 2–3 month or by a daily dose of 1 mg vitamin B12.

### Intravenous vitamin injections: where is the evidence? [^c9409d8f]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2023). Medium credibility.

The body needs small daily quantities of vitamins and minerals, which are usually obtained from the diet. Intravenous vitamins are used for a few serious medical conditions (eg, malabsorption syndromes with severe vitamin depletion, Wernicke's encephalopathy or critical illness). Intravenous drips containing high doses of various vitamins and minerals (eg, the so-called 'Myers' cocktail') have been promoted in popular culture to 'reduce stress', 'increase energy' or 'boost immunity', with claims that the intravenous route allows faster absorption of vitamins into the bloodstream than if they are taken orally. There is a lack of high-quality evidence to suggest that high-dose vitamin infusions are necessary or offer any health benefit in the absence of a specific vitamin deficiency or medical condition. There may be harms from taking high (non-physiological) quantities of some vitamins and minerals. Licensed forms of injectable vitamins that are prescription-only medicines should not be advertised to the public and should only be supplied and administered by appropriately qualified healthcare professionals.

### Oral vitamin B12 versus intramuscular vitamin B12 for vitamin B12 deficiency: a systematic review of randomized controlled trials [^b48f8f1c]. Family Practice (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Vitamin B(12) deficiency is common, increasing with age. Most people are treated in primary care with intramuscular vitamin B(12). Several studies have reported equal efficacy of oral administration of vitamin B(12).

Objectives

We set out to identify randomized controlled trial (RCT) evidence for the effectiveness of oral versus intramuscular vitamin B(12) to treat vitamin B(12) deficiency.

Methods

We conducted a systematic review searching databases for relevant RCTs. Outcomes included levels of serum vitamin B(12), total serum homocysteine and methylmalonic acid, haemoglobin and signs and symptoms of vitamin B(12) deficiency.

Results

Two RCTs comparing oral with intramuscular administration of vitamin B(12) met our inclusion criteria. The trials recruited a total of 108 participants and followed up 93 of these from 90 days to 4 months. In one of the studies, mean serum vitamin B(12) levels were significantly higher in the oral (643 ± 328 pg/ml; n = 18) compared with the intramuscular group (306 ± 118 pg/ml; n = 15) at 2 months (P < 0.001) and 4 months (1005 ± 595 versus 325 ± 165 pg/ml; P < 0.0005) and both groups had neurological responses. In the other study, serum vitamin B(12) levels increased significantly in those receiving oral vitamin B(12) and intramuscular vitamin B(12) (P < 0.001).

Conclusions

The evidence derived from these limited studies suggests that 2000 microg doses of oral vitamin B(12) daily and 1000 microg doses initially daily and thereafter weekly and then monthly may be as effective as intramuscular administration in obtaining short-term haematological and neurological responses in vitamin B(12)-deficient patients.

Inflammatory bowel disease — vitamin B12 deficiency prevalence, risk, screening, and repletion: prevalence of vitamin B12 deficiency in patients with Crohn's disease ranges from 5.6% to 38%. Patients with ileocecal disease and/or terminal ileal resection > 30 cm with an ileoanal pouch are at increased risk, and yearly screening is warranted in high-risk patients or those with clinical features of deficiency. Repletion with 1000 μg vitamin B12 injections (intramuscular or subcutaneous) at 1- to 4-week intervals for life is suggested, and compared with sublingual supplementation, intramuscular or subcutaneous supplementation remains the current preferred route for long-term repletion in patients with documented deficiency.

### Oral cobalamin therapy for the treatment of patients with food-cobalamin malabsorption [^6e7e1913]. The American Journal of Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Background

The standard treatment for cobalamin (vitamin B(12)) deficiency involves regular intramuscular cobalamin injection. It has been suggested that oral cobalamin therapy may be effective for treating patients who have food-cobalamin malabsorption.

Subjects and Methods

We prospectively studied 10 patients with cobalamin deficiency and well-established food-cobalamin malabsorption who received 3000 microg or 5000 microg of oral crystalline cyanocobalamin once a week for at least 3 months. Complete blood counts and serum cobalamin, homocysteine, and folate levels were determined at baseline and after 3 months of treatment. Patients were reexamined after 6 months.

Results

After 3 months of treatment, all patients had increased hemoglobin levels (mean increase, 1.9 g/dL; 95% confidence interval: 0.9 to 3.9 g/dL; P < 0.01 compared with baseline) and decreased erythrocyte cell volume (mean decrease, 7.8 fL; 95% confidence interval: 0.9 to 16.5 fL; P < 0.001). However, 2 patients had only minor, if any, responses. Serum cobalamin levels were increased in all 8 patients in whom it was measured.

Conclusion

Our findings suggest that moderate doses of crystalline cyanocobalamin given orally may be an effective treatment for food-cobalamin malabsorption.

### Subnormal vitamin B12 concentrations and anaemia in older people: a systematic review [^68a81c93]. BMC Geriatrics (2010). Low credibility.

Intervention studies

We found three randomized placebo-controlled trials with a total number of 210 participants that met the inclusion criteria for intervention studies for our review (Table 2). Detailed information about the trials can be found in Additional file 7. These three trials included patients with low or subnormal vitamin B12 levels concentrations at the start of the study. The first trial by Hughes and colleagues included a random sample of 39 persons aged ≥ 65 years registered at general practices in a town in Wales, UK, that were treated for 4 weeks with intramuscular hydroxocobalamin or placebo. Haemoglobin was measured after 5 weeks. The second trial by Hvas et al. included 140 persons in Aarhus, Denmark, with elevated methylmalonic acid levels (median age 75 years in the treatment group and 74 years in the placebo group) that received weekly intramuscular injections of cyanocobalamin of placebo for 1 month. Haemoglobin was measured after 3 months (13 weeks). In the third trial by Seal and colleagues, 31 persons in two geriatric hospitals in Melbourne, Australia, (mean age ≥ 78 years) received two different doses of oral cyanocobalamin daily or placebo for 4 weeks.

Table 2
Summary of the results and quality assessment of the intervention studies included in this review

Based on checklist from Jadad et al. Higher scores indicate higher quality (range 0–5). Intervention studies that scored 3 points or more were considered 'high quality'.

Due to clinical heterogeneity (differences in methods of administration, dose of vitamin B12, outcome measures and treatment follow-up time) we did not combine the results in a meta-analysis. However, all three RCTs, of which two were regarded high quality ("see Additional file 8 "), showed no beneficial effect of vitamin B12 administration on haemoglobin concentrations and MCV. In the study by Hughes et al, there was, on average, a small decrease in haemoglobin level during the trial but the difference between the mean changes in those given vitamin B12 and those given placebo was very small and not statistically significant. In the study by Hvas et al, the change in haemoglobin level was the same in the vitamin B12 group and placebo group. In addition, no differences were observed in the mean change in haemoglobin level in the three treatment groups in the study by Seal et al.

Risk Factors for Folate Deficiency

Low folate levels usually occur in the context of a restricted diet, bariatric surgery, or malabsorption. Increased cell turnover such as pregnancy, severe eczema, chronic hemolysis, or exfoliative skin disease can contribute as well. Folate losses can occur with chronic hemodialysis or external biliary drainage.

Diagnosis and Treatment of Vitamin B12 and Folate Deficiency

Evaluation for vitamin B12 and folate deficiency often occurs simultaneously. A complete evaluation for deficiency would evaluate vitamin B12, folate, methylmalonic acid (MMA), and homocysteine levels. Anti-intrinsic factor and anti-parietal cell antibodies should be considered to evaluate for pernicious anemia. Patients on chronic dialysis should have RBC folate levels evaluated rather than serum folate. Homocysteine levels are increased in both folate and vitamin B12 deficiencies however MMA is only elevated in B12 deficiency. Of note, although elevated homocysteine is associated with increased thrombosis, folic acid supplementation has not been showed to reduce the risk of such events.

A vitamin B12 value < 200pg/ml is indicative of deficiency. Vitamin B12 levels 200-300pg/ml and folate levels between 2-4ng/mL are considered borderline and may warrant further investigation. Vitamin B12 levels may be normal in those with nitrous oxide overuse as the underlying etiology is inactivation rather than deficiency. However homocysteine and methylmalonic acid levels will be elevated.

Vitamin B12 repletion should factor the underlying cause and severity of symptoms. Intramuscular route is preferred in patients with malabsorption or severe hematologic or neurologic symptoms. Initial dose can range from 1000mcg of intramuscular cyanocobalamin one to three times a week for 4 weeks or once daily for the first week followed by once a week doses for 4 weeks. Once symptoms improve, patients can be maintained on intramuscular preparation of 1000mcg once a month. Oral supplementation of 1000mcg can be used in those with milder symptoms and an intact gastrointestinal tract. A supratherapeutic oral dose has been used to promote passive absorption, bypassing the active transport mediated by intrinsic factor, in those with malabsorption who are unable to take intramuscular injections.

Folate repletion can start at 1 to 5mg a day until anemia improves followed by maintenance dose of 400mcg if the reason for deficiency persists. Vitamin B12 levels should be closely monitored as prolonged high dose folic acid supplementation may improve anemia but worsen an underlying vitamin B12 deficiency, leading to neurologic damage.

There are also several positives for PA patients from the 2024 NICE guidelines

The guidelines' emphasis on a symptom-based approach to treatment is an urgent and necessary shift that could positively influence current practice. They also stress the importance of individualised care, suggesting that B 12 replacement dosage, frequency, and delivery method may need to be tailored to ensure treatment efficacy. However, many patients require treatment more frequently than current guidelines suggest. Survey data indicates that up to 50% of patients require more frequent injections to manage their symptoms effectively (Thain et al. 2024, DOI: 10.1101/2024.08.30.24312837). This is consistent with findings from Hooper et al. where 65% of patients received B 12 injections according to current guidelines (every 2–3 months). Further qualitative evidence from interviews also highlights that many PA patients considered the current guidelines too restrictive, with symptoms reoccurring well before the next planned injection.

### A.S.P.E.N. position paper: recommendations for changes in commercially available parenteral multivitamin and multi-trace element products [^6ebd1ae5]. Nutrition in Clinical Practice (2012). Medium credibility.

Vitamin B12 — intake, storage, enterohepatic cycling, and excretion are summarized as follows: In the United States, the median adult B12 intake from food is 5 mcg/d for men and 3.5 mcg/d for women. The liver takes up 50% of dietary B12 and provides the main storage site, and the total body B12 content is 1–3 mg. Vitamin B12 has an enterohepatic circulation, and each day, about 1 to 4 μg is secreted into the bile and can be recaptured if intrinsic factor (IF) is present. If IF is absent or the distal ileum has been resected, clinical B12 deficiency can develop in a few months, whereas B12 deficiency in vegans develops over many years. After a parenteral injection of B12, if the circulating vitamin exceeds transcobalamin (TC) binding capacity, the excess is secreted in the urine. Vitamin B12 toxicity has not been described.

### Effect of vitamin B12 injection on the vocal performance of professional singers: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial [^11465355]. JAMA Otolaryngology — Head & Neck Surgery (2021). High credibility.

Importance

One-third of singers and vocal professionals report experiencing a benefit from empirical vitamin B12 injections for improvement of mild singing-related symptoms (eg, reduced stamina, vocal fatigue, and effort). However, there is no objective evidence to support or refute these claims.

Objective

To assess the presence and magnitude of the effect of empirical vitamin B12 injection on the vocal performance of singers.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial was conducted from November 7, 2017, to November 30, 2018, at an academic voice center among 20 active adult singers without dysphonia but with mild vocal symptoms. Individuals with known or suspected vitamin B12 deficiency or active or recent vitamin B12 treatment were excluded. Analysis was on a per-protocol basis.

Interventions

Participants were randomized to receive an intramuscular (deltoid) injection of either vitamin B12 (1000 μg of cyanocobalmin) or placebo (0.9% sodium chloride). After a washout period of at least 4 weeks, participants were crossed over to receive the opposite injection. Both the investigators and participants were blinded to the order of injections.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The participants completed the Singing Voice Handicap Index-10 (SVHI-10), the Voice Fatigue Index (VFI), and the Evaluation of the Ability to Sing Easily (EASE) before each injection and at intervals of 1 hour, 3 hours, 24 hours, 72 hours, and 1 week after the injection. The primary time point assessment was 72 hours after injection, and the SVHI-10 score was the primary outcome measure.

Results

Twenty singers (10 men; median age, 22 years [range, 19–42 years]) were enrolled. The improvements after either placebo or vitamin B12 injections were comparable to each other. At 72 hours after the vitamin B12 injection, the median difference in the SVHI-10 score was 1 (95% CI, -1 to 2) compared with 3 (95% CI, 0–4) after placebo. The median difference between differences at 72 hours between placebo and vitamin B12 injections were 1.5 (95% CI, -2 to 5) for the SVHI-10, 1 (95% CI, -9 to 9) for the VFI, and -1 (95% CI, -3 to 2) for the EASE. The improvements after both injections failed to reach the estimated minimal clinically important difference. Of the 20 participants, 4 (20%) reached the estimated minimal clinically important difference in their SVHI-10 score after 72 hours for both vitamin B12 and placebo injections.

Conclusions and Relevance

This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial found that after empirical vitamin B12 injection to improve mild voice-related symptoms, the improvement in self-reported voice measures in singers shows no meaningful difference compared with placebo.

### Effect of combined diclofenac and B vitamins (thiamine, pyridoxine, and cyanocobalamin) for low back pain management: systematic review and meta-analysis [^d4708dfa]. Pain Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Clinical Implications

The current review and meta-analysis revealed evidence confirming a superior analgesic effect for the combination of diclofenac with TPC over conventional therapy (diclofenac monotherapy) in patients with acute LBP, or acute exacerbations of the chronic condition, with or without degenerative lumbar spine disease without discopathy. The doses of diclofenac ranged between 75 and 150 mg/d, whereas the doses of vitamins B1 and B6 were between 100 and 300 mg/d. The dose of vitamin B12 ranged between 0.75 and 2 mg/d in the study by Mibielli et al. which reported the greatest levels of pain relief. These results are in agreement with those reported by the Magaña-Villa et al. study of patients with severe osteoarthritis of the knee and the Ponce-Monter et al. study of patients with lower limb fractures and surgery, in which cyanocobalamin doses of 2 mg/d or more were used. Importantly, cyanocobalamin as monotherapy delivered by intramuscular route has previously been assessed in patients with chronic back pain against placebo in an RCT, with a greater reduction in the VAS in patients who received vitamin B12 (average reduction of 66 points), compared with those given placebo (average reduction of 34 points; P < 0.0001). We speculate that the analgesic effect of combining thiamine, pyridoxine, and cyanocobalamin may be largely due to vitamin B12.

### The association between vitamin B12, albuminuria and reduced kidney function: an observational cohort study [^46f44c9b]. BMC Nephrology (2015). Low credibility.

Potential mechanisms

B12 in the blood is primarily protein-bound. Approximately 20% of circulating B12 is bound to holotranscobalamin (TC2) with the remainder to haptocorrin. TC2-bound B12 is the biologically active form as B12 bound to haptocorrin cannot be taken up into cells. A congenital form of megaloblastic anemia has been described in infants lacking TC2 despite normal total B12 levels. The kidney plays an important role in TC2 metabolism. TC2 is filtered at the glomerulus and is reabsorbed in the proximal tubule by megalin. B12 is then returned to the blood bound to newly synthesized TC2. Thus, defects in protein reabsorption in the proximal tubule could lead to a loss of biologically active TC2 in the urine.

Increased TC2 and haptocorrin levels have been noted in patients with CKD. Despite this, there is decreased uptake of TC2 into cells. This can lead to a paradoxical increase in cellular homocysteine levels despite normal total B12. Thus, a functional B12 deficiency can occur in patients with CKD in the setting of increased TC2 losses in the urine, decreased TC2 absorption in the proximal tubule and decreased cellular uptake of TC2.

Another important consideration is the possibility that elevated B12 levels and B12 supplementation may be harmful in individuals with CKD. Cyanide metabolism is abnormal in individuals with CKD due to decreased clearance. Cyanocobalamin, the most commonly used form of B12 replacement is metabolized to active methylcobalamin releasing small amounts of cyanide. Under normal circumstances, methylcobalamin acts as a means of removing cyanide from the circulation through conversion to cyanocobalamin. However, in patients with CKD the reduced cyanide clearance prevents conversion of cyanocobalamin to the active form and therefore supplementation in this form is less effective at reducing homocysteine levels.

In fact, a recent randomized trial of cyanocobalamin administration found more rapid GFR decline and cardiovascular morbidity in the treatment arm. It was suggested that this may be related to increased synthesis of assymetric dimethylarginine which is known to inhibit nitric oxide. However, the data above suggest that in fact this finding may result from the use of cyanocobalamin rather than methylcobalamin in this population and that methylcobalamin should be preferred in individuals with CKD. Unfortunately, as we do not have data on vitamin supplementation, this is speculative and would warrant further investigation.

### Update on vitamin B12 deficiency [^9a3e684a]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Vitamin B(12) (cobalamin) deficiency is a common cause of megaloblastic anemia, a variety of neuropsychiatric symptoms, and elevated serum homocysteine levels, especially in older persons. There are a number of risk factors for vitamin B(12) deficiency, including prolonged use of metformin and proton pump inhibitors. No major medical organizations, including the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, have published guidelines on screening asymptomatic or low-risk adults for vitamin B(12) deficiency, but high-risk patients, such as those with malabsorptive disorders, may warrant screening. The initial laboratory assessment of a patient with suspected vitamin B(12) deficiency should include a complete blood count and a serum vitamin B(12) level. Measurements of serum vitamin B(12) may not reliably detect deficiency, and measurement of serum homocysteine and/or methylmalonic acid should be used to confirm deficiency in asymptomatic high-risk patients with low normal levels of vitamin B(12). Oral administration of high-dose vitamin B(12) (1 to 2 mg daily) is as effective as intramuscular administration in correcting the deficiency, regardless of etiology. Because crystalline formulations are better absorbed than naturally occurring vitamin B(12), patients older than 50 years and strict vegetarians should consume foods fortified with vitamin B(12) and vitamin B(12) supplements, rather than attempting to get vitamin B(12) strictly from dietary sources. Administration of vitamin B(12) to patients with elevated serum homocysteine levels has not been shown to reduce cardiovascular outcomes in high-risk patients or alter the cognitive decline of patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer disease.

### Vitamin B12 deficiency: common questions and answers [^99fb3f54]. American Family Physician (2025). Medium credibility.

Vitamin B12 deficiency occurs in approximately 2% to 3% of adults in the United States. Risk factors include malabsorptive processes, limited dietary intake of vitamin B12, use of certain medications (eg, metformin, proton pump inhibitors), and older age. Symptoms vary based on the severity of vitamin B12 deficiency but may include fatigue, brain fog, depression, peripheral neuropathy, and ataxia. Although universal screening is not recommended, testing should be considered in patients with at least one risk factor for and one clinical feature of vitamin B12 deficiency. Initial testing includes total serum vitamin B12 level, which is diagnostic for deficiency if less than 180 pg/mL. Borderline levels (180–350 pg/mL) warrant a methylmalonic acid measurement, which is diagnostic for vitamin B12 deficiency if elevated. Patients without a clear cause of deficiency should undergo further testing for atrophic gastritis with a Helicobacter pylori test and evaluation for autoantibodies associated with autoimmune gastritis. Oral vitamin B12 supplementation can be used in most patients and is noninferior to intramuscular supplementation. Intramuscular administration should be considered in patients with severe deficiency or neurologic manifestations. Vitamin B12 levels that are persistently elevated (greater than 1,000 pg/mL on two measurements) have been associated with solid tumors, hematologic malignancy, and increased risk of cardiovascular death.

### A systematic review of attributes influencing preferences for treatments and interventions in people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) [^41d02a73]. Muscle & Nerve (2025). Medium credibility.

3.1.1 Ease of Use

Most pwALS recruited from four European countries faced challenges in swallowing riluzole that led to treatment delays or omissions (Table 1). These people had the strongest preference for a new formulation with an easier mode of delivery that dissolved quickly on the tongue and had convenient/portable packaging. Similarly, an implanted drug delivery device (IDDD) was considered to be a preferred alternative to a lumbar puncture for intrathecal therapy by pwALS in multiple clinical settings in the US and Europe, due to it being perceived as an easier mode of delivery. PwALS valued a shorter duration and less frequent administration of the treatment. Despite a general acceptance of edaravone, 22/331 (6.6%) participants voluntarily suspended this potential disease‐modifying drug treatment due to the burden of the intravenous route of administration.

TABLE 1
Summary of preferences results for drug treatment studies.

Difficulties were expressed with the range of syringes available for the injection of methylcobalamin, a form of vitamin B12 with limited evidence of potential slowing of functional decline in ALS. It was reported "It would be good to have a standard syringe, because otherwise, you have to learn every time". A single ALS centre observed the use of PB‐TURSO, a combination of sodium phenylbutyrate (PB) and taurursodiol (TURSO) for the disease modification of ALS. The study observed a high discontinuation rate due to gastrointestinal side effects 17/29 (58.6%) and the drug's taste 8/29 (27.6%).

The ease of administration is also important to pwALS when receiving drug treatments to manage the symptoms of their ALS. Almost all people with ALS were satisfied with the effectiveness of tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabidiol (THC:CBD) for treating symptoms of spasticity, but a third reported issues with the ease of administration of the oromucosal spray, highlighting the way this restricts usability.

3.1.2 Accessibility

PwALS express the importance of affordability in deciding whether to start or continue a drug treatment. " Riluzole is too expensive. If it is cheaper, I would try it ". Similar concerns were expressed regarding vitamin B12 injections, where " The cost poses a barrier to how often I take the [vitamin B12] shots now.29 ".

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of hydroxocobalamin IM (also known as Cyanokit):
- **Decreased serum potassium, increased platelet count**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as hypokalemia and thrombocytosis can occur upon conversion of severe megaloblastic to normal erythropoiesis with B12 therapy. Monitor serum potassium levels and platelet count.
- **Impaired response to vitamin B12**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as the therapeutic response to vitamin B12 may be impaired in patients with infection, uremia, bone marrow suppression from drugs such as chloramphenicol, or concurrent iron or folic acid deficiency.
- **Polycythemia vera**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as vtamin B12 deficiency may suppress the signs of polycythemia vera and treatment with vitamin B12 may unmask this condition.

### Oral vitamin B12 supplementation in pernicious anemia: a prospective cohort study [^0619db39]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The absorption of vitamin B12 is hindered in pernicious anemia (PA) owing to intrinsic factor deficiency. Traditionally, intramuscular vitamin B12 injections were the standard treatment, bypassing the impaired absorption. Although there is potential for oral vitamin B12 supplementation through passive enteral absorption, it is not commonly prescribed in PA owing to limited studies assessing its efficacy.

Objectives

We aimed to assess the efficacy of oral vitamin B12 supplementation in PA.

Methods

We enrolled participants diagnosed with incident vitamin B12 deficiency related to PA. The diagnosis of PA was based on the presence of classical immune gastritis and of anti-intrinsic factor and/or antiparietal cell antibodies. To evaluate the vitamin B12 status, we measured total plasma vitamin B12, plasma homocysteine, and plasma methylmalonic acid (pMMA) concentration and urinary methylmalonic acid-to-creatinine ratio. Participants were treated with oral cyanocobalamin at a dosage of 1000 μg/d throughout the study duration. Clinical and biological vitamin B12 deficiency related features were prospectively and systematically assessed over the 1-y study duration.

Results

We included 26 patients with vitamin B12 deficiency revealing PA. Following 1 mo of oral vitamin B12 supplementation, 88.5% of patients were no longer deficient in vitamin B12, with significant improvement of plasma vitamin B12 [407 (297–485) compared with 148 (116–213) pmol/L; P < 0.0001], plasma homocysteine [13.5 (10.9–29.8) compared with 18.6 (13.7–46.8) μmol/L; P < 0.0001], and pMMA [0.24 (0.16–0.38) compared with 0.56 (0.28–1.09) pmol/L; P < 0.0001] concentrations than those at baseline. The enhancement of these biological parameters persisted throughout the 12-month follow-up, with no patients showing vitamin B12 deficiency by the end of the follow-up period. The median time to reverse initial vitamin B12 deficiency abnormalities ranged from 1 mo for hemolysis to 4 mo for mucosal symptoms.

Conclusions

Oral supplementation with 1000 μg/d of cyanocobalamin has been shown to improve vitamin B12 deficiency in PA.

NASEMSO National Model EMS Clinical Guidelines — Hydroxocobalamin (Cyanokit®) is classified as a cyanide antidote, with pharmacologic action described as vitamin B12 with hydroxyl group complexed to cobalt which can be displaced by cyanide resulting in cyanocobalamin that is renally excreted. It is indicated for the management of cyanide toxicity and contraindicated in documented hypersensitivity. The warning notes it will cause discoloration of the skin and urine, can interfere with pulse oximetry, and because it interferes with certain diagnostic blood tests, prehospital phlebotomy is preferable prior to administration.

### Cyanocobalamin injection USP 1, 000 mcg / mL… [^fef49851]. FDA (DailyMed) (2025). Medium credibility.

CYANOCOBALAMIN- cyanocobalamin injection Sportpharm, Inc. dba Sportpharm ----------. Cyanocobalamin Injection, USP is a sterile solution of cyanocobalamin for intramuscular or subcutaneous use. Each mL contains 1, 000 mcg cyanocobalamin; sodium chloride 0. 9%; benzyl alcohol

1. 5%; Water for Injection q. s.; Hydrochloric acid and/or sodium hydroxide for pH adjustment if necessary. The chemical name is 5, 6-dimethyl-benzimidazolyl cyanocobamide. The cobalt content is 4. 34%. The structural formula is represented below: Vitamin B 12is essential to growth, cell reproduction, hematopoiesis, nucleoprotein and myelin synthesis. Cyanocobalamin is quantitatively and rapidly absorbed from intramuscular and subcutaneous sites of injection; the plasma level of the compound reaches its peak within one hour after intramuscular injection. Absorbed Vitamin B 12is transported via specific B 12binding proteins, transcobalamin I and II to the various tissues.

The liver is the main organ for Vitamin B 12storage. Vitamin B 12is bound to intrinsic factor during transit through the stomach; separation occurs in the terminal ileum in the presence of calcium, and Vitamin B 12enters the mucosal cell for absorption. It is then transported by the transcobalamin binding proteins. A small amount is absorbed by simple diffusion, but this mechanism is adequate only with very large doses. Oral absorption is considered too undependable to rely on in patients with pernicious anemia or other conditions resulting in malabsorption of Vitamin B 12. Cyanocobalamin is the most widely used form of Vitamin B 12, and has hematopoietic activity apparently identical to that of the antianemia factor in purified liver extract. Hydroxocobalamin is equally as effective as cyanocobalamin, and they share the cobalamin molecular structure.

Cyanocobalamin is indicated for Vitamin B 12deficiencies due to malabsorption which may be associated with the following conditions: Addisonian anemia Gastrointestinal pathology, dysfunction, or surgery, including gluten enteropathy or sprue, small bowel bacterial overgrowth, total or partial gastrectomy.

Symptomatic deficiency in people with B 12 malabsorption

Suggested treatment schemes differ considerably between countries. The British National Formulary (BNF), for example, differentiates the prescription of hydroxocobalamin according to presenting symptoms, eg, "For neurological involvement, it is advised to administer hydroxocobalamin by intramuscular injection, initially 1 mg once daily on alternate days until no further improvement, then 1 mg every 2 months". In the Netherlands, pharmacotherapeutic guidelinesrecommend (for the same neurological symptoms or abnormalities) administration of 1000 mcg once or twice weekly for up to two years. Little robust, reliable evidence supports current recommended dosing schedules, and no clinical studies assess the effectiveness and optimal dosing of intramuscular cobalamin preparations for symptom relief, other than studies assessing attained serum B 12 concentrations and sometimes haematological response. Studies as early as the 1960s reported considerable differences between individuals in pharmacodynamicsand dose requirements. Some patients may require a more frequent injection regimen, especially those with neurological symptoms, varying from twice weekly to every 2–4 weeks to become and remain asymptomatic. A possible explanation may be the large inter-individual difference in biliary B 12 excretion. More than two thirds of the B 12 excreted in bile is reabsorbed in the small intestine, but this reabsorption is reduced in people with pernicious anaemia or other causes of B 12 malabsorption.

Nitrous oxide toxicity

The Association of British Neurologists has recently issued guidance on recognising and managing nitrous oxide toxicity associated with B 12 deficiency. It recommends rapid initiation of alternate-day intramuscular hydroxocobalamin therapy, and maintenance of this treatment until all symptoms have resolved or there is no further neurological improvement, with long term B 12 therapy depending on the presence of deficiency on presentation, together with total abstinence from the use of nitrous oxide.
