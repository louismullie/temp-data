## Question

Hi, is cystine-c a marker of renal function?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether cystatin C (the user wrote "cystine-c") is a marker of renal function. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the terminology and biological plausibility of cystatin C as a filtration marker. Then, I should verify head-to-head validation against measured GFR and how it compares with creatinine. Next, I will examine non-GFR determinants, standardization, and availability issues. After that, I need to review guideline recommendations and regulatory use. Finally, I will consider prognostic value and synthesize practical clinical applications before concluding with a balanced recommendation.

> Let me first confirm the terminology because precision matters; the question says "cystine-c", but wait, that seems off — hold on, I should verify — yes, the correct biomarker is cystatin C, a low–molecular weight cysteine protease inhibitor produced at a near-constant rate by nucleated cells, freely filtered by the glomerulus with negligible tubular secretion, making its serum concentration inversely related to GFR and biologically credible as a filtration marker.

> Next, I should review the direct validation against measured GFR; the landmark CKD-EPI analyses in NEJM developed cystatin C–only and creatinine–cystatin C combined equations and validated them against measured iohexol GFR, and wait, let me verify the performance — yes, the combined equation had better precision and fewer large errors than creatinine or cystatin C alone, which strengthens confidence that cystatin C contributes real signal about GFR estimation accuracy [^1151ULyu].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about superiority in every setting; I need to compare determinants and biases versus creatinine, and here cystatin C has a key advantage in being largely independent of muscle mass and dietary protein, enabling more accurate eGFR in people with low or atypical muscle mass and in settings where race coefficients for creatinine are problematic, thereby supporting use of cystatin C or combined equations to improve accuracy and equity in eGFR estimation [^113Z68RZ] [^111SjC68] [^114shjdX].

> But wait, what if cystatin C is also influenced by non-GFR factors — I should double-check that; after GFR adjustment, cystatin C varies with diabetes, inflammation, obesity, smoking, thyroid status, and even shows sex and age effects in some analyses, meaning it is not a perfect GFR-isolated signal and clinicians must interpret levels in clinical context rather than assuming pure filtration biology [^114h6MDC] [^114WwGpH] [^113Z68RZ].

> Hmm, I almost said cystatin C simply increases with age regardless of GFR, but let me reconsider; population studies show higher cystatin C with aging, whereas some adjusted analyses suggest a small decrease with age after accounting for measured GFR, highlighting that unadjusted epidemiology and GFR-adjusted physiology can point in different directions — this reinforces the need to interpret cystatin C alongside clinical context and, when possible, in combined equations to buffer non-GFR influences [^112Fd9ew] [^114h6MDC] [^1151ULyu].

> I need to ensure assay and implementation issues are addressed; standardization of cystatin C assays is improving but not fully optimized, availability remains limited in many labs, costs are higher than creatinine, and different eGFRcys equations can yield different estimates at the same concentration, so operational barriers and equation selection still matter in real-world adoption [^113Z68RZ] [^114VFrRf] [^116EABqS].

> Next, I should review authoritative guidance; KDIGO 2024 explicitly recommends using cystatin C, where available, together with creatinine to assign GFR categories, and also advises health systems to enable measurement of both markers, while methodologic advances like the EKFC eGFRcys equation demonstrate accurate, race- and sex–neutral implementation; regulators further endorse clinical use, as FDA labels for certain antisense therapies mandate cystatin C for baseline and safety monitoring, underscoring clinical validity and utility [^114shjdX] [^113KiU9n] [^1133E75J] [^112GVmyi] [^1153Cscv].

> I will now examine prognostic value beyond static GFR estimation; adding cystatin C to creatinine improves CKD detection, staging, and risk reclassification for mortality and cardiovascular outcomes across diverse cohorts, and elevated cystatin C predicts cardiovascular and heart failure events even when creatinine-based eGFR is normal, yet Mendelian randomization finds no causal effect on CVD, suggesting cystatin C is a powerful risk marker rather than a mediator of vascular disease [^1151ULyu] [^112TjbJh] [^112FKNp7] [^1176gBhY].

> Let me consider medication dosing and acute care scenarios; approaches incorporating cystatin C often improve prediction of drug exposure for narrow-therapeutic-index agents like vancomycin, and in patients with abnormal or changing muscle mass — frail older adults, neuromuscular disease, amputation, cirrhosis — the combined creatinine–cystatin C equations generally provide the most accurate and least biased eGFR for clinical decisions, though I should confirm equation choice and assay traceability locally before acting on small differences [^116EABqS] [^111SjC68] [^115zUBQ1].

> Hold on, I should verify the synthesis before concluding; the weight of evidence supports cystatin C as a valid filtration marker that enhances eGFR accuracy, especially when combined with creatinine, with clear benefits in specific populations and for prognostication, but with important caveats about non-GFR determinants, assay standardization, and access that necessitate cautious, context-aware use rather than blanket replacement of creatinine [^1151ULyu] [^114shjdX] [^113Z68RZ] [^114q3FTC].

> Final take: yes, cystatin C is a reliable marker of renal function and is guideline-endorsed to complement creatinine, not supplant it; I recommend using the combined CKD-EPI or EKFC approaches where available, reserving cystatin C for confirmatory testing, atypical body composition, critical dosing decisions, and risk stratification, while advocating for improved assay availability and standardization to fulfill the promise outlined by KDIGO and validated in large cohorts [^111SjC68] [^114PNWLg] [^114shjdX] [^1151ULyu].

Cystine-C does not express renal function. The correct biomarker is **cystatin C**, which is a validated endogenous marker of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) [^1151ULyu] and is recommended by KDIGO 2024 [^114shjdX] for confirming CKD diagnosis and staging when creatinine-based eGFR is uncertain or discordant [^114q3FTC]. Cystatin C is **less affected by muscle mass, diet, and race** [^114PNWLg] than creatinine, making it especially useful in older adults, those with low muscle mass, or when creatinine is unreliable [^113KiU9n] [^116EABqS]. It is not a direct measure of renal function [^111dFPsn] but a surrogate marker that improves accuracy when combined with creatinine [^1151ULyu].

---

## Biological basis of cystatin C as a renal function marker

Cystatin C is a 13 kDa cysteine protease inhibitor produced at a constant rate by all nucleated cells [^114VFrRf]; it is freely filtered by the glomerulus and almost completely reabsorbed and catabolized in the proximal tubules [^113KiU9n], with minimal urinary excretion. Serum levels **rise as GFR declines** [^1151ULyu], making it a sensitive indicator of reduced kidney function.

---

## Clinical utility of cystatin C in renal function assessment

Cystatin C is widely used to **estimate GFR (eGFR)** [^111SjC68] and is particularly valuable when creatinine is unreliable due to muscle mass, diet, or race [^1119AfVX]. It is recommended to confirm CKD diagnosis and staging [^114q3FTC] when creatinine-based eGFR is uncertain or discordant [^114shjdX].

---

## Advantages of cystatin C over traditional renal function markers

Cystatin C offers several **advantages over creatinine**:

- **Muscle mass independence**: Less affected by muscle mass, age, sex, or race, improving accuracy in older adults, those with low muscle mass, or chronic illness [^113KiU9n] [^116EABqS].

- **Early detection**: More sensitive to mild or early kidney dysfunction [^113KiU9n], enabling earlier intervention [^116XHT6q].

- **Prognostic value**: Strongly associated with mortality [^113KiU9n] and cardiovascular events [^1119AfVX], providing additional prognostic information [^1176gBhY].

---

## Limitations and confounding factors in cystatin C measurement

Despite its advantages, cystatin C **has limitations**:

- **Non-renal influences**: Levels can be affected by inflammation, thyroid dysfunction, corticosteroids, smoking [^114WwGpH], and obesity [^113Z68RZ].

- **Assay variability**: Differences in assays and lack of standardization [^113Z68RZ] can affect accuracy and comparability [^114h6MDC].

- **Cost and availability**: More expensive and less widely available [^112Guu5f] than creatinine, limiting routine use.

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

KDIGO 2024 **recommends cystatin C** [^114shjdX] to confirm CKD diagnosis and staging [^114q3FTC] when creatinine-based eGFR is uncertain or discordant. It is particularly useful in older adults, those with low muscle mass, or when creatinine is unreliable [^113KiU9n] [^116EABqS].

## Comparison with other renal function biomarkers

| **Biomarker** | **Advantages** | **Limitations** |
|-|-|-|
| Creatinine | Widely available and inexpensive | Influenced by muscle mass, diet, age, sex, and race, and less sensitive to early kidney dysfunction [^113KiU9n] |
| Cystatin C | - Less influenced by muscle mass, diet, age, sex, race <br/> - More sensitive to early kidney dysfunction <br/> - Strong prognostic value | - Influenced by inflammation, thyroid dysfunction, corticosteroids, smoking, obesity <br/> - More expensive <br/> - Less widely available [^113KiU9n] [^114h6MDC] |
| Beta-2 microglobulin | Useful in specific clinical scenarios | Limited availability and less commonly used [^113KiU9n] |

---

## Clinical scenarios where cystatin C is particularly useful

Cystatin C is **especially useful** in:

- **Older adults**: Less influenced by age-related muscle loss [^111WgMMm] [^113KiU9n].

- **Low muscle mass**: More accurate in sarcopenia or chronic illness [^111NPLAh] [^113KiU9n].

- **Early kidney dysfunction**: More sensitive to mild impairment [^113KiU9n] [^1119AfVX].

- **Unreliable creatinine**: Useful when creatinine is affected by diet, muscle mass, or race [^113KiU9n] [^111SjC68].

---

## Conclusion

Cystatin C is a **validated endogenous marker of GFR** [^1119AfVX] and is recommended by KDIGO 2024 [^114shjdX] to confirm CKD diagnosis and staging [^114q3FTC] when creatinine-based eGFR is uncertain or discordant. It is less affected by muscle mass, diet, and race [^113KiU9n] than creatinine, making it particularly useful in older adults [^116EABqS], those with low muscle mass, or when creatinine is unreliable. However, its levels can be influenced by inflammation, thyroid dysfunction, corticosteroids, smoking, and obesity, and testing is more expensive and less widely available [^112Guu5f] than creatinine.

### Cystatin C is ready for clinical use [^116EABqS]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2020). Low credibility.

The goal of this update is to raise awareness of clinical scenarios where cystatin C has clear and immediate benefits as an alternative glomerular filtration rate (GFR) biomarker to supplement creatinine. An additional goal is to focus the estimated GFR (eGFR) controversy onto medication prescribing for agents with narrow therapeutic windows where better GFR estimation will lead to improved medical care.

Equations that include cystatin C predict GFR more accurately than serum creatinine in children, adults, and older adults, with larger effects among persons who are acutely ill. Numerous studies have evaluated medication dosing based on either GFR estimate; vancomycin was the most frequently studied drug, and its target level and elimination were better predicted by cystatin C. Overall, approaches to medication dosing and monitoring that include cystatin C concentrations have been shown to result in a better achievement of drug trough levels. Furthermore, cystatin C offers the opportunity to avoid the race coefficient that is required for any creatinine-based eGFR equation, which has been appropriately criticized for introducing unnecessary imprecision, assumptions, and values on GFR estimation.

Hospital laboratories must make cystatin C available for clinical care to improve the safety and efficacy of medications that have narrow therapeutic windows.

### Estimating glomerular filtration rate from serum creatinine and cystatin C [^1151ULyu]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Estimates of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) based on serum creatinine are routinely used; however, they are imprecise, potentially leading to the overdiagnosis of chronic kidney disease. Cystatin C serves as an alternative filtration marker for estimating GFR.

- **Methods**: Using cross-sectional analyses, we developed estimating equations based on cystatin C alone and in combination with creatinine in diverse populations totaling 5,352 participants from 13 studies. These equations were then validated in 1,119 participants from five different studies in which GFR had been measured. Cystatin and creatinine assays were traceable to primary reference materials.

- **Results**: Mean measured GFRs were 68 and 70 mL per minute per 1.73 m² of body-surface area in the development and validation data sets, respectively. In the validation data set, the creatinine-cystatin C equation performed better than equations that used creatinine or cystatin C alone. Bias was similar among the three equations, with a median difference between measured and estimated GFR of 3.9 mL per minute per 1.73 m² with the combined equation, compared with 3.7 and 3.4 mL per minute per 1.73 m² with the creatinine equation and the cystatin C equation (P = 0.07 and P = 0.05), respectively. Precision was improved with the combined equation (interquartile range of the difference, 13.4 vs. 15.4 and 16.4 mL per minute per 1.73 m², respectively [P = 0.001]). The percentage with a difference greater than 30% of measured GFR was 8.5% vs. 12.8% and 14.1%, respectively [P < 0.001 for both].

### Cystatin C as a biomarker for estimating glomerular filtration rate [^113KiU9n]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2015). Low credibility.

Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is rarely measured in clinical practice because of the complexity of the measurement. As such, kidney function is typically estimated using validated study equations that use readily available data, including age, sex, race, and serum creatinine as a filtration marker. Contemporary research suggests that cystatin C may be an improved alternative to creatinine for inclusion in GFR estimating equations. This article evaluates the benefits and limitations of using cystatin C as a biomarker of filtration.

Recent findings indicate that cystatin C has fewer non-GFR determinants compared with serum creatinine. The use of serum cystatin C avoids the limitations related to both diet and muscle mass that affect serum creatinine. Cystatin C may be more accurate than serum creatinine in estimating GFR and is more strongly associated with all-cause mortality and cardiovascular events.

Cystatin C has some advantages over serum creatinine in estimating GFR. The use of cystatin C as a confirmatory biomarker in deciding medication dosages or as a confirmatory test in patients with an uncertain diagnosis of chronic kidney disease may be beneficial.

### Factors other than glomerular filtration rate affect serum cystatin C levels [^114h6MDC]. Kidney International (2009). Low credibility.

Cystatin C is an endogenous glomerular filtration marker; hence its serum level is affected by the glomerular filtration rate (GFR). To study what other factors might affect its blood level, we performed a cross-sectional analysis of 3,418 patients, which included a pooled dataset of clinical trial participants and a clinical population with chronic kidney disease. The serum cystatin C and creatinine levels were related to clinical and biochemical parameters, and errors-in-variables models were used to account for errors in GFR measurements. The GFR was measured as the urinary clearance of 125I-iothalamate and 51Cr-EDTA. Cystatin C was determined at a single laboratory, while creatinine was standardized to reference methods and these were 2.1 ± 1.1 mg/dL and 1.8 ± 0.8 mg/L, respectively.

After adjustment for GFR, cystatin C was 4.3% lower for every 20 years of age, 9.2% lower for female gender, but only 1.9% lower in Blacks. Diabetes was associated with 8.5% higher levels of cystatin C and 3.9% lower levels of creatinine. Higher C-reactive protein and white blood cell count, and lower serum albumin were associated with higher levels of cystatin C and lower levels of creatinine. Adjustment for age, gender, and race had a greater effect on the association of factors with creatinine than with cystatin C. Hence, we found that cystatin C is affected by factors other than GFR, which should be considered when the GFR is estimated using serum levels of cystatin C.

The association of elevated circulating levels of cystatin C with adverse medium- and long-term outcomes underscores the importance of chronic kidney disease (CKD) as a cardiovascular risk factor in our aging societies. However, our data also support the additional prognostic value for major cardiovascular disease (CVD) events and long-term mortality of measurement of circulating cystatin C, which allows improved assessment of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).

### Serum creatinine-to-cystatin-C ratio as a potential muscle mass surrogate and racial differences in mortality [^114VZQVP]. Journal of Renal Nutrition (2023). Low credibility.

Serum creatinine-based estimated glomerular filtration rate equations and muscle mass are powerful markers of health and mortality risk. However, the serum creatinine-to-cystatin-C ratio may be a better indicator of health status. The objective of this study was to describe the relationship between the creatinine-to-cystatin-C ratio and all-cause mortality when stratifying patients by race and chronic kidney disease status.

- **Methods**: This retrospective cohort study examined Black and non-Black US veterans between October 2004 and September 2019, with baseline cystatin C and creatinine data from those not on dialysis during the study period. Veterans were divided into four creatinine-to-cystatin-C ratio groups: < 0.75, 0.75- < 1.00, 1.0- < 1.25, and ≥ 1.25. The primary outcome of interest was all-cause mortality subsequent to the cystatin C laboratory measure.

- **Results**: Among 22,316 US veterans, the mean (± standard deviation) age of the cohort was 67 ± 14 years. Five percent were female, 82% were non-Black, and 18% were Black. The proportion of Black veterans increased across creatinine-to-cystatin-C ratio groups. In the fully adjusted model, compared with the reference (creatinine-to-cystatin-C ratio: 1.00- < 1.25), a creatinine-to-cystatin-C ratio < 0.75 had the highest mortality risk among both Black and non-Black veterans (non-Black: hazard ratio (HR) [95% confidence interval (CI)]: 3.01 [2.78–3.26] and Black: 4.17 [3.31–5.24]). A creatinine-to-cystatin-C ratio ≥ 1.25 was associated with lower death risk than the reference in both groups. Non-Black: HR [95% CI]: 0.89…

### Genetic analysis of elevated levels of creatinine and cystatin C biomarkers reveals novel genetic loci associated with kidney function [^115iTuYf]. Human Molecular Genetics (2025). High credibility.

The rising prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD), affecting an estimated 37 million adults in the United States, presents a significant global health challenge. CKD is typically assessed using estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), which incorporates serum levels of biomarkers such as creatinine and cystatin C. However, these biomarkers do not directly measure kidney function; their elevation in CKD results from diminished glomerular filtration. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) based on eGFR formulas using creatinine (eGFRcre) or cystatin C (eGFRcys) have identified distinct non-overlapping loci, raising questions about whether these loci govern kidney function or biomarker metabolism.

In this study, we show that GWAS on creatinine and cystatin C levels in healthy individuals reveal both non-overlapping genetic loci impacting their metabolism as well as overlapping genetic loci associated with kidney function. In contrast, GWAS on elevated levels of these biomarkers uncover novel loci primarily associated with kidney function in CKD patients.

### What should European nephrology do with the new CKD-EPI equation [^113Z68RZ]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2023). Low credibility.

Third, we could change the analyte from creatinine or add an analyte to creatinine as a marker for kidney function. In this respect, cystatin C has received the most attention. In contrast to creatinine, cystatin C is produced by all nucleated cells, not only by myocytes, and its serum concentration is therefore not dependent on muscle mass. The CKD-EPI research group showed that new eGFR equations that incorporate creatinine and cystatin C, but omit race, are more accurate and lead to smaller differences between Black participants and non-Black participants than new equations that do not include race and use creatinine alone. Moreover, the use of cystatin C alone or in combination with creatinine strengthens the association between eGFR and the risks of death and kidney failure across diverse populations.

Unfortunately, cystatin C is not widely available for clinical use because not every clinical chemistry lab offers its measurement, and the related costs are generally considerably higher than those for serum creatinine. Additionally, cystatin C is not independent of specific subject characteristics. For instance, it is increased in obesity, hyperthyroidism, and inflammatory states, and steroids also increase cystatin C values. Furthermore, the standardization of cystatin C measurement has not yet been fully optimized. Efforts should therefore be made to make cystatin C available at lower costs and to improve its standardization. At the moment, measurement of cystatin C for GFR estimation is especially advised for subjects with clearly abnormal muscle mass for their age and sex, and for subjects with…

### Genetic analysis of elevated levels of creatinine and cystatin C biomarkers reveals novel genetic loci associated with kidney function [^112ndPMe]. Human Molecular Genetics (2025). Low credibility.

These observations underscore the multifaceted nature of biomarker metabolism and kidney function regulation. While creatinine-specific and cystatin C-specific loci play distinct roles in biomarker metabolism, many loci shared between creatinine and cystatin C are involved in kidney function, gene expression, and disease. Previous studies have shown cystatin C levels associated with chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes and hypertension. It is not known whether these associations are due to impaired kidney function caused by these diseases or whether there is a direct link between cystatin C levels and other biomarkers, such as cholesterol. Our findings that cystatin C-specific loci are associated with HDL levels in the bottom99 dataset support previous observations suggesting that these associations represent a direct link.

### Method of glomerular filtration rate estimation affects prediction of mortality risk [^115Rkm6s]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2009). Low credibility.

Decreased kidney function, determined using a serum creatinine-based estimation of GFR, is associated with a higher risk for mortality from cardiovascular disease. Equations incorporating cystatin C improve the estimation of GFR, but whether this improves the prediction of risk for mortality is unknown. We measured cystatin C on 6,942 adult participants in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey Linked Mortality File, including all participants who had high serum creatinine (> 1.2 mg/dl for men; > 1.0 mg/dl for women) or were older than 60 years and a 25% random sample of participants who were younger than 60 years. We estimated GFR using equations that included standardized serum creatinine, cystatin C, or both. Participant data were linked to the National Death Index.

A total of 1,573 (22.7%) deaths (713 deaths from cardiovascular disease) occurred during a median of 8 years. Lower estimated GFR based on cystatin C was strongly associated with higher risk for overall and cardiovascular mortality across the range of normal to moderately decreased estimated GFR. Creatinine-based estimates of GFR resulted in weaker associations, with the association between estimated GFR and all-cause mortality reversed at higher levels of estimated GFR. An equation using both creatinine and cystatin C (in addition to age, race, and gender) resulted in weaker associations than equations using only cystatin C (with or without age, race, and gender).

In conclusion, despite better performance in terms of estimating GFR, equations based on both cystatin C and creatinine do not predict mortality as effectively as those based solely on cystatin C.

### Cystatin C as a risk factor for outcomes in chronic kidney disease [^1135KAEE]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

No study has compared cystatin C level, serum creatinine concentration, and estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) as risk factors for outcomes in chronic kidney disease (CKD), and none has compared measured GFR with CKD in any population.

- **Objective**: To compare cystatin C level with serum creatinine concentration and iothalamate GFR as risk factors for death and kidney failure.

- **Design**: Observational study using serum cystatin C assayed from baseline samples of the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study (1989–1993).

- **Setting**: Fifteen clinical centers in the United States that participated in the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study.

- **Participants**: 825 trial participants with stage 3 or 4 nondiabetic CKD who had measurements of serum cystatin C.

- **Measurements**: All-cause mortality, cardiovascular (CVD) mortality, and kidney failure until December 2000.

Results indicated that the mean cystatin C level, creatinine concentration, and GFR were 2.2 mg/L (SD, 0.7), 212.16 micromol/L (SD, 88.4) (2.4 mg/dL [SD, 1.0]), and 33 mL/min per 1.73 m² (SD, 12), respectively. The median follow-up was 10 years. Twenty-five percent of patients (n = 203) died of any cause, 15% (n = 123) died of CVD, and 66% (n = 548) reached kidney failure. In multivariate-adjusted models, 1-SD decreases in 1/creatinine, GFR, and 1/cystatin C were associated with increased risks for all-cause mortality of 1.27 (95% CI, 1.06 to 1.49), 1.27 (CI, 1.08 to 1.49), and 1.41 (CI, 1.18 to 1.67), respectively. For CVD mortality, the increased risks were 1.32 (CI, 1.05 to 1.64), 1.28 (CI, 1.04 to 1.59), and 1.64 (CI, 1.

### Serum cystatin C as a marker of glomerular filtration rate [^114VFrRf]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2006). Low credibility.

Glomerular filtration rate is widely accepted as the best overall measure of kidney function. Currently available methods to estimate glomerular filtration rate have strengths and limitations. Cystatin C is a novel endogenous filtration marker being considered as a potential replacement for serum creatinine. This review summarizes the currently available glomerular filtration rate estimating equations based on cystatin C and the literature comparing cystatin C and creatinine as filtration markers.

- **Recent findings**: In most cystatin C estimating equations, the inclusion of age and sex did not substantially improve their performance. Equations yield different glomerular filtration rate estimates for the same level of cystatin C. Variation among equations may be due to differences among the assays or populations in the individual studies. Studies comparing cystatin C with creatinine or creatinine-based estimating equations show heterogeneous results, with some showing improved performance and others showing equivalent performance, even in similar populations. These heterogeneous results may be due to inappropriate comparisons between equations developed in one population and those developed in another, or to the differences between assays or population characteristics.

- **Summary**: Cystatin C shows promise as an alternative to serum creatinine, but several important questions remain before it can be recommended for use in clinical practice.

### Gestational and age-specific cystatin C reference intervals for newborns [^115aPUd5]. American Journal of Perinatology (2022). Low credibility.

Cystatin C (CysC) references are useful for monitoring renal function in neonates. However, the standard CysC references in newborn infants have not been determined. The aim of this study was to establish a useful reference range for CysC in newborns.

- **Study design**: Serum CysC levels were measured in 1,919 blood samples from 1,044 newborns during their first 28 days of life. CysC levels were analyzed for associations between subgroups dichotomized by postnatal age (PA) and gestational age (GA). The serum CysC reference intervals were determined according to PA and GA. Associations between serum CysC levels and other biochemical parameters, as well as perinatal factors, were also analyzed.

- **Results**: In this study, the mean GA was 35.8 ± 2.9 weeks and the birth weight (BW) was 2,614 ± 697g. Reference ranges of serum CysC were determined, and a general decreasing trend of CysC levels was observed as GA increased. CysC levels differed significantly among PA and GA categories (p < 0.001). Serum CysC levels were relatively stable throughout the GA range but were impacted by the white blood cell count within the first postnatal 24 hours. Moreover, CysC levels always correlated positively with serum creatinine concentrations (p < 0.001). Serum creatinine levels were influenced by multiple factors, including BW, GA, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, white blood cell count, C-reactive protein, and blood urea nitrogen.

- **Conclusion**: Reference levels of serum CysC should be determined according to PA and GA. In contrast to creatinine, serum CysC is a reliable index for monitoring renal function in newborns.

### Traditions and innovations in assessment of glomerular filtration rate using creatinine to cystatin C [^111SjC68]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2023). High credibility.

Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is the best index for kidney function. Estimated GFR (eGFR), calculated from endogenous filtration markers like serum creatinine and cystatin C, is widely used in clinical practice for chronic kidney disease diagnosis and prognostication. This review explores the evolution of GFR estimating equations, nuances of eGFR interpretation, and the utility of eGFR in drug dosing.

- **Recent findings**: The Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) serum creatinine eGFR equation was recently updated to exclude the race variable. The CKD-EPI creatinine-cystatin C equation demonstrated the highest reliability. Although calculated creatinine clearance by Cockcroft Gault has been traditionally used for drug dosing, the use of eGFR is gradually being adopted by the Food and Drug Administration for pharmacokinetic studies. However, the individual-level accuracy of eGFR using the CKD-EPI 2021 equations remains low, with the distribution of measured GFR at a given eGFR value spanning several CKD stages.

- **Summary**: Although methods for estimating GFR have improved in terms of population measures of reliability, significant individual-level inaccuracies remain, posing a challenge for clinical decision-making contingent on the actual level of GFR. Modern methods of GFR measurements should be made widely available to enhance individualized patient decision-making.

### Detection of renal function decline in patients with diabetes and normal or elevated GFR by serial measurements of serum cystatin C concentration: results of a 4-year follow-up study [^116XHT6q]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2005). Low credibility.

Research on early renal function decline in diabetes is hampered by the lack of simple tools for detecting trends, particularly systematic decreases in renal function over time when GFR is normal or elevated. This study sought to assess how well serum cystatin C meets that need.

Thirty participants with type 2 diabetes in the Diabetic Renal Disease Study met these three eligibility criteria: GFR > 20 ml/min per 1.73 m² at baseline (based on cold iothalamate clearance), 4 years of follow-up, and yearly measurements of iothalamate clearance and serum cystatin C. Using linear regression, each individual's trend in renal function over time, expressed as the annual percentage change in iothalamate clearance, was determined.

Serum cystatin C in mg/L was transformed to its reciprocal (100/cystatin C), and linear regression was used to determine each individual's trend over time, expressed as an annual percentage change. In paired comparisons of 100/cystatin C with iothalamate clearance at each examination, the two measures were numerically similar. More importantly, the trends in 100/cystatin C and iothalamate clearance were strongly correlated (Spearman r = 0.77). All 20 participants with negative trends in iothalamate clearance (declining renal function) also had negative trends for 100/cystatin C. Results were discordant for only three participants.

In contrast, the trends for three commonly used creatinine-based estimates of GFR compared poorly with trends in iothalamate clearance (Spearman r < 0.35). Serial measures of serum cystatin C accurately detect trends in renal function.

### Update on cystatin C: New insights into the importance of mild kidney dysfunction [^114kUbmq]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2006). Low credibility.

Using cystatin C, a novel serum marker of kidney function, several studies have shown that mild kidney dysfunction is associated with increased risk for cardiovascular disease and mortality. Notably, there is ongoing debate regarding whether cystatin C primarily measures kidney function. This review summarizes the research literature on cystatin C.

- **Recent findings**: One longitudinal study involving patients with diabetes found that cystatin C approximated glomerular filtration rate measures over a span of 4 years much more accurately than creatinine. Studies across several cohorts have identified a linear association between cystatin C and mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and heart failure risk, whereas creatinine predicted increased risk only in individuals with severe kidney dysfunction. However, a separate study reported associations of cystatin C with increased age, male sex, greater height and weight, smoking, and elevated C-reactive protein levels after adjusting for creatinine clearance, which may imply nonrenal influences on cystatin C concentrations.

Cystatin C appears to effectively capture the link between mild kidney dysfunction and heightened risk for cardiovascular disease and mortality. Future research should evaluate the potential clinical relevance of cystatin C.

### Circulating cystatin C is an independent risk marker for cardiovascular outcomes, development of renal impairment, and long-term mortality in patients with stable coronary heart disease: The LIPID study [^112Guu5f]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). High credibility.

Our data also show that in those patients with normal eGFR-creatinine at baseline, plasma cystatin C was a significant predictor of the development of renal dysfunction, independent of baseline eGFR-creatinine and other CKD risk factors. Our data are consistent with those of other investigators, who have shown that plasma cystatin C can predict the onset of CKD and its progression to end-stage renal disease. However, because this association was no longer significant with eGFR-creatinine-cystatin C in the statistical model, the prognostic value of circulating cystatin C appears to relate particularly to its superior estimation of renal function, with no significant effects unrelated to this mechanism.

Numerous cardiovascular biomarkers have been described. In addition to their important role in the diagnosis of MI (cardiac troponins) and heart failure (BNP and NT-proBNP), biomarkers may have other applications. Our data confirm the possibility of refining risk stratification with the estimation of cystatin C levels. However, the potential incorporation of biomarkers in usual practice also mandates other considerations. These include the availability and reliability of the assay and its cost-effectiveness. The assay for circulating cystatin C is not widely available. It is also expensive compared with the measurement of creatinine. Although it is recommended in the United Kingdom for possible measurement in those with a creatinine-GFR of 45–59 mL/min per 1.73 m² and no albuminuria, the general use of eGFR-cystatin in the primary care setting in the United Kingdom has been shown…

### Use of cystatin C levels in estimating renal function and prognosis in patients with chronic systolic heart failure [^117Tx8cq]. Heart (2012). Low credibility.

Estimates of glomerular filtration rate (GFR), including creatinine and creatinine-based formulae, are inaccurate in extremes of GFR and substantially biased in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF).

- **Objective**: To investigate whether serum cystatin C levels would be a better, more accurate, and simple alternative for estimation of GFR and prognosis in CHF.

- **Design**: Cohort study.

- **Setting**: Chronic heart failure.

- **Patients, interventions and main outcome measure**: In 102 CHF patients, the correlation between GFR as estimated by (125)I-iothalamate clearance (GFR(IOTH)), the modification of diet in renal disease formula (GFR(MDRD)), and cystatin C was investigated. The combined endpoint consisted of the first occurrence of all-cause mortality, heart transplantation, or admission for CHF within 24 months.

- **Results**: Mean age was 58 ± 12 years; 77% were male. Mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 28 ± 9%. Mean GFR(IOTH) was 75 ± 27 ml/min/1.73 m², while median cystatin C levels were 0.80 (0.69–1.02) mg/l. GFR(IOTH) was strongly correlated with all renal function estimates, including 1/cystatin C (r = 0.867, p < 0.001). GFR(IOTH) was better predicted by 1/cystatin C compared to 1/serum creatinine (z = 3.12, p = 0.002), but equally predicted compared to GFR(MDRD) (z = 0.92, p = 0.356). Serum 1/cystatin C was a strong independent predictor of prognosis (HR: 2.27 per SD increase, 95% CI 1.12 to 4.63), comparable to GFR(MDRD).

- **Conclusions**: Cystatin C is an accurate and easy estimate of renal function with prognostic properties superior to serum creatinine and similar to creatinine-based measures.

### Serum creatinine and serum cystatin C as an index of muscle mass in adults [^111NPLAh]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2024). High credibility.

Serum creatinine reflects both muscle mass and kidney function. Serum cystatin C has recently been recommended as an additional marker for estimating kidney function, and the use of both markers together may provide an index of muscle mass. This review aims to describe the biological basis for, and recent research examining, the relationship of these markers to muscle mass in a range of adult populations and settings.

This review identified 67 studies, 50 of which had direct measures of muscle mass, and almost all found relationships between serum creatinine and cystatin C and muscle mass and related outcomes. Most studies have been performed in older adults, but similar associations were found in general populations as well as in subgroups with cancer, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and other morbid conditions. Creatinine to cystatin C ratio was the measure examined the most often, but other measures showed similar associations across studies.

Measures of serum creatinine and cystatin C together can be an index of muscle mass. They are simple and reliable measures that can be used in clinical practice and research. Further study is needed to determine actionable threshold values for each measure and the clinical utility of testing and intervention.

### Amondys 45 [^1133E75J]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Monitoring to assess safety**: Serum cystatin C, urine dipstick, and urine protein-to-creatinine ratio (UPCR) should be measured before starting AMONDYS 45. Consider measurement of glomerular filtration rate prior to initiation of AMONDYS 45. Monitoring for kidney toxicity during treatment is recommended. Obtain the urine sample prior to infusion of AMONDYS 45 or at least 48 hours after infusion [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

- **Dosing information**: The recommended dosage of AMONDYS 45 is 30 milligrams per kilogram, administered once weekly as a 35 to 60-minute intravenous infusion via an in-line 0.2 micron filter. If a dose of AMONDYS 45 is missed, it may be administered as soon as possible after the scheduled dose.

### The role of cystatin C in improving GFR estimation in the general population [^111yN9ah]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

The equations used to estimate glomerular filtration rate (GFR) based on serum creatinine level are limited by their dependence on muscle mass. Although cystatin C level predicts clinical outcomes better than creatinine level in the general population, its role in estimating GFR in the reference range is unclear. Cystatin C level is not influenced by muscle mass but by several other non-GFR determinants. We investigated whether regression models using cystatin C level alone or in combination with creatinine level would improve GFR estimation in the general population compared with models using creatinine level alone.

- **Study design**: Study of diagnostic accuracy.
- **Setting & participants**: A representative sample (n = 1,621; aged 50–62 years) of the general population in Tromsø, Norway, without coronary heart disease, stroke, diabetes mellitus, or kidney disease. Individuals participated in the Renal Iohexol Clearance Survey (RENIS-T6), part of the sixth Tromsø Study.
- **Index test**: Performance of multiple linear and fractional polynomial regression models with plasma creatinine and/or cystatin C levels as independent variables and measured GFR as a dependent variable.
- **Reference test**: Plasma iohexol clearance.
- **Other measurements**: Creatinine measured with an enzymatic method. Cystatin C measured with a particle-enhanced turbidimetric immunoassay.

Results indicated that in internal validation of models with cystatin C, creatinine, or both levels, the percentages of GFR estimates within 10% of measured GFR were 61% (95% CI, 58%-63%), 62% (95% CI, 59%-64%), and 68% (95%).

### Circulating cystatin C is an independent risk marker for cardiovascular outcomes, development of renal impairment, and long-term mortality in patients with stable coronary heart disease: The LIPID Study [^1177daXK]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Low credibility.

There has been considerable interest in the cardiorenal syndrome. A recent scientific statement from the American Heart Association describes the syndrome as encompassing "a spectrum of disorders involving both the heart and kidneys in which acute or chronic dysfunction in one organ may induce acute or chronic dysfunction in the other organ". Cystatin C is listed as one of the clinically relevant biomarkers in the syndrome. If cystatin C is a risk factor for CVD events, particularly heart failure which was not examined in our study, this could be another mechanism for an increase in the development of CKD. Conversely, if cystatin C is a risk factor for developing CKD, this might also be a mechanism for an increase in CVD events.

Finally, large Mendelian randomization studies and their meta-analysis appear to argue against cystatin C being causal and directly implicated in the development of atherosclerosis. This is because genetic variants that increase cystatin C levels have not been associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events. In contrast to our findings, these observations lend support to considering circulating cystatin C to be a powerful marker, rather than a mediator of vascular risk, including in those with a "normal" eGFR.

### Kidney function and clinical recommendations of drug dose adjustment in geriatric patients [^111WgMMm]. BMC Geriatrics (2013). Low credibility.

An alternative marker for kidney function is serum cystatin C, which has been widely examined and compared with the diagnostic use of serum creatinine. According to two meta-analyses, the diagnostic accuracy of cystatin C for impaired renal function ranges between slightly and clearly better than the diagnostic accuracy of creatinine.

In elderly patients, cystatin C appears to be a suitable marker for assessing renal function because there is evidence that it is less sensitive to metabolic and extrarenal factors than creatinine. There are a large number of cystatin C-based equations for estimating GFR. Several of these have been evaluated in elderly patients in comparison to a reference standard. Hojs et al. showed in an analysis of 234 patients aged 65 years and older that serum creatinine-based formulas, such as the MDRD-4-variable, had slightly lower diagnostic accuracy than cystatin C-based formulas using 51Cr-EDTA clearance as a reference standard. The Hoek-formula had the highest accuracy, and the Grubb-formula and the Perkins-formula (Simple Cystatin C formula) showed reasonable accuracy compared to 51Cr-EDTA clearance.

A German study examined if there was sufficient drug dose adjustment according to the results of several eGFR-equations based on cystatin C or creatinine in patients 60 years and older who were treated by an emergency physician. The number of patients without appropriate dose adjustment according to kidney function varied considerably depending on the equation used for calculating eGFR, as eGFR values themselves differed notably.

### Viltepso [^112GVmyi]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Serum cystatin C, urine dipstick, and urine protein-to-creatinine ratio should be measured before starting Viltepso. Consider measurement of the glomerular filtration rate prior to the initiation of Viltepso. Monitoring for kidney toxicity during treatment is recommended. Obtain the urine samples prior to infusion of Viltepso or at least 48 hours after the most recent infusion [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

- **Dosing information**: The recommended dosage of Viltepso is 80 mg/kg administered once weekly as a 60-minute intravenous infusion. If a dose of Viltepso is missed, it should be administered as soon as possible after the scheduled dose time.

### Cystatin C versus creatinine in determining risk based on kidney function [^1119AfVX]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2013). High credibility.

Adding the measurement of cystatin C to that of serum creatinine to determine the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) improves accuracy. However, the effect on detection, staging, and risk classification of chronic kidney disease across diverse populations has not yet been determined.

- **Methods**: We performed a meta-analysis of 11 general-population studies (with 90,750 participants) and 5 studies of cohorts with chronic kidney disease (2,960 participants) for whom standardized measurements of serum creatinine and cystatin C were available. We compared the association of the eGFR, calculated via creatinine or cystatin C alone or in combination with creatinine, with the rates of death (13,202 deaths in 15 cohorts), death from cardiovascular causes (3,471 in 12 cohorts), and end-stage renal disease (1,654 cases in 7 cohorts). We also assessed improvement in reclassification with the use of cystatin C.

- **Results**: In the general-population cohorts, the prevalence of an eGFR of less than 60 mL per minute per 1.73 m² of body-surface area was higher with the cystatin C-based eGFR than with the creatinine-based eGFR (13.7% vs. 9.7%). Across all eGFR categories, reclassification of the eGFR to a higher value with the measurement of cystatin C, as compared with creatinine, was associated with a reduced risk of all three study outcomes. Conversely, reclassification to a lower eGFR was associated with an increased risk. The net reclassification improvement with the measurement of cystatin C, as compared with creatinine, was 0.23 (95% confidence interval, 0.18 to…).

### Age, gender, and race effects on cystatin C levels in US adolescents [^113JQrsy]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2008). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to describe the normal range of serum cystatin C and identify factors associated with variability in serum cystatin C, contrasting with factors that are known to influence creatinine levels in the general US adolescent population.

- **Design, setting, participants, and measurements**: Serum cystatin C and creatinine were measured in 719 participants aged 12 to 19 years in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, a national cross-sectional survey conducted from 1988 through 1994. We calculated gender- and race/ethnicity-specific cystatin C and creatinine ranges and conducted multivariable linear regression analyses to assess factors that contribute to variability in cystatin C and creatinine levels.

- **Results**: Overall, the mean serum cystatin C level was 0.84 mg/L and was higher in males than females and higher in non-Hispanic White individuals compared to non-Hispanic Black and Mexican American individuals. The mean serum creatinine was 0.71 mg/dL and was higher in males than in females, but lower in non-Hispanic White and Mexican American individuals compared with non-Hispanic Black individuals. Unlike creatinine, which increases with age from 12 to 19 years, cystatin C levels decrease, particularly in females. After adjusting for age, gender, and race/ethnicity, uric acid and blood urea nitrogen were significantly associated with cystatin C levels.

- **Conclusions**: Serum cystatin C is significantly related to gender, age, race/ethnicity, uric acid, and blood urea nitrogen in adolescents.

### Creatinine- and cystatin C-based estimated glomerular filtration rate slopes for the prediction of kidney outcome: a comparative retrospective study [^113VfCDm]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Low credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a major public health problem worldwide and is associated with adverse outcomes and high medical costs. It is important to identify the high risk of CKD progression to slow the worsening of kidney dysfunction and to prepare for the transition toward end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Many studies have shown that early, short-term changes in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) can predict CKD progression. Clinical guidelines recommend assessing the risk of ESRD by monitoring the estimated GFR (eGFR) trends over time.

The eGFR is a practical method for assessing kidney function. Serum creatinine level is a standard marker extensively used to calculate eGFR. However, serum creatinine levels are affected by muscle mass, age, sex, race, and diet, besides kidney function. Serum cystatin C concentration has been introduced as an endogenous marker of kidney function and has been used to calculate the eGFR. It is reported to be independent of age, sex, and body mass. Several studies have demonstrated similar accuracies between creatinine-based (eGFRcr) and cystatin C-based eGFRs (eGFRcys) in the assessment of static kidney function. The advantage of the cystatin C-based equation is that it is independent of race and obtains a more accurate estimation of GFR in patients with muscle wasting or chronic illness.

Nonetheless, data on the comparative usefulness of serum cystatin C and serum creatinine levels for the assessment of eGFR trends over time are limited. In this study, we calculated eGFRcr and eGFRcys slopes by using serial, simultaneous measurements to evaluate their effectiveness in predicting kidney outcomes.

### Time to rethink the current paradigm for assessing kidney function in drug development and beyond [^114WwGpH]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2022). Low credibility.

Serum cystatin C levels are influenced not only by kidney function but also by factors such as obesity, thyroid disorders, viral load in HIV patients, cancer, high-dose steroid therapy, inflammation, and smoking. Unlike serum creatinine, serum cystatin C is less affected by age, sex, muscle mass, and dietary protein intake. Therefore, serum cystatin C is considered superior to serum creatinine for diagnosing early chronic kidney disease, provided other influencing factors are accounted for, including smoking.

In a meta-analysis involving 8,592 individuals, cigarette smoking was associated with higher serum cystatin C levels after adjusting for creatinine clearance, indicating that smoking may impact cystatin C levels independently of kidney function. A study with 86 smokers observed time-dependent changes in serum cystatin C after smoking cessation. Serum cystatin C levels decreased significantly at three months post-cessation and remained stable compared to baseline levels from three months to one year, likely due to improved vascular function and increased blood flow.

Another factor influencing serum cystatin C is obesity. Numerous clinical trials have demonstrated that obesity, as determined by BMI or waist circumference, is independently associated with high serum cystatin C levels. A study involving 2,583 subjects from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1999–2002) in the United States indicated similar results.

### Cystatin C concentration as a risk factor for heart failure in older adults [^112FKNp7]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Previous studies that evaluated the association of kidney function with incident heart failure may be limited by the insensitivity of serum creatinine concentration for detecting abnormal kidney function.

- **Objective**: To compare serum concentrations of cystatin C (a novel marker of kidney function) and creatinine as predictors of incident heart failure.

- **Design**: Observational study based on measurement of serum cystatin C from frozen sera obtained at the 1992–1993 visit of the Cardiovascular Health Study. Follow-up occurred every 6 months.

- **Setting**: Adults 65 years of age or older from four communities in the United States.

- **Participants**: 4384 persons without previous heart failure who had measurements of serum cystatin C and serum creatinine.

- **Measurements**: Incident heart failure.

- **Results**: The mean (± SD) serum concentrations of cystatin C and creatinine were 82 ± 25 nmol/L (1.10 ± 0.33 mg/L) and 89 ± 34 micromol/L (1.01 ± 0.39 mg/dL), respectively. During a median follow-up of 8.3 years (maximum 9.1 years), 763 (17%) participants developed heart failure. After adjustment for demographic factors, traditional and novel cardiovascular risk factors, cardiovascular disease status, and medication use, sequential quintiles of cystatin C concentration were associated with a stepwise increased risk for heart failure in Cox proportional hazards models (hazard ratios: 1.0, 1.30 [95% CI, 0.96 to 1.75], 1.44 [CI, 1.07 to 1.94], 1.58 [CI, 1.18 to 2.12], and 2.16 [CI, 1.61 to 2.91]). In contrast, quintiles of serum creatinine concentration were not associated with a significant increase in heart failure risk.

### Impact of cystatin C levels on infarct size and hemorrhage volume in acute cerebral stroke [^116tjm8u]. Journal of Neurology (2012). Low credibility.

Studies have indicated that serum levels of cystatin C, a sensitive marker of renal function, are significantly associated with cerebral vascular events. However, the influence of cystatin C on infarct size and hemorrhage volume in acute cerebral stroke has not been well established. A total of 222 patients with cerebral infarction and 69 patients with cerebral hemorrhage, as well as 122 healthy controls, were included in this study. Patients were further divided into subgroups according to infarct size and hemorrhage volume. Serum levels of cystatin C were significantly higher in cerebral-stroke patients than in healthy controls (p < 0.05). Patients with larger infarcts or larger hemorrhage volumes had higher levels of cystatin C (p < 0.05). Certain factors affect cystatin C levels in cerebral-stroke patients, and they could be considered independent predictors of infarct size and hemorrhage volume in acute cerebral stroke events.

### Microalbuminuria, but not cystatin C, is associated with carotid atherosclerosis in middle-aged adults [^114PZpB2]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2007). Low credibility.

Cystatin C, a marker of renal function, has been shown to be an independent predictor of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in older adults, but few data are available in middle-aged adults. Moreover, no study has compared cystatin C and microalbuminuria as risk factors for CVD outcomes in middle-aged adults, and it is not known whether cystatin C is related to an early stage of atherosclerosis.

- **Methods**: We evaluated the relationships between serum creatinine, estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR), serum cystatin C (all divided into tertiles), microalbuminuria, and carotid atherosclerosis in a population-based random sample of 523 adults aged 35–64 years from the Seychelles (Indian Ocean). GFR was estimated using the modification of diet in renal disease (MDRD) equation. Intima-media thickness (IMT) was assessed by B-mode ultrasound.

- **Results**: The mean age of the study sample was 52 years, and 55% were women. Carotid IMT was higher in participants with microalbuminuria (802 vs. 732 micrometers, P < 0.001) and was inversely associated with GFR tertiles (from 728 to 809 micrometers, P for trend = 0.002). IMT was not associated with cystatin C or creatinine (P for trend = 0.10 and 0.16, respectively). In multivariate analyses adjusted for cardiovascular risk factors, the association between microalbuminuria and IMT remained (P = 0.047), while the association between GFR and IMT disappeared (P for trend = 0.33).

- **Conclusions**: Microalbuminuria, but not cystatin C, is associated with carotid atherosclerosis beyond traditional cardiovascular risk factors among middle-aged adults.

### The chronic kidney disease-epidemiology collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation does not improve the underestimation of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in people with diabetes and preserved renal function [^114wRg7L]. BMC Nephrology (2015). Low credibility.

However, more recent studies using cystatin C values harmonized against an international reference standard and the CKD-EPI 2102 cystatin equation have failed to show that estimating GFR based on cystatin C, compared with creatinine, provides a substantial improvement in accuracy. The use of GFR estimating equations based on a combination of serum cystatin C and creatinine values may provide a more accurate way of estimating GFR in routine clinical practice. Unfortunately, we did not have cystatin C values measured using a harmonized assay to derive cystatin-eGFR or cystatin-creatinine-eGFR values to allow a comparison of bias, precision, and accuracy with creatinine-eGFR or values in the study.

The limitations of this study, including the relatively small number of participants — especially in the longitudinal study where only two estimates of GFR were made for each participant — are acknowledged. Furthermore, in our longitudinal study, stored serum samples for re-assay were not available, and estimates of eGFR were based on creatinine levels stored in our database, which were originally measured by the Jaffe reaction. An attempt to harmonize these historical results with an enzymatic method was made, but it is appreciated that this approach has its limitations. Possibly, longer studies that examine the relationship between eGFR, measured GFR, and multiple clinical and biochemical variables at multiple time points in a prolonged longitudinal study of people with and without diabetes will help to delineate the reasons why the discrepancies occur.

### Cystatin C and cardiovascular disease: A Mendelian randomization study [^1176gBhY]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

Epidemiological studies show that high circulating cystatin C is associated with risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), independent of creatinine-based renal function measurements. It is unclear whether this relationship is causal, arises from residual confounding, or is a consequence of reverse causation. The aim of this study was to use Mendelian randomization to investigate whether cystatin C is causally related to CVD in the general population.

- **Methods**: We incorporated participant data from 16 prospective cohorts (n = 76,481) with 37,126 measures of cystatin C and added genetic data from 43 studies (n = 252,216) with 63,292 CVD events. We used the common variant rs911119 in CST3 as an instrumental variable to investigate the causal role of cystatin C in CVD, including coronary heart disease, ischemic stroke, and heart failure.

- **Results**: Cystatin C concentrations were associated with CVD risk after adjusting for age, sex, and traditional risk factors (relative risk: 1.82 per doubling of cystatin C; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.56 to 2.13; p = 2.12 × 10⁻¹⁴). The minor allele of rs911119 was associated with decreased serum cystatin C (6.13% per allele; 95% CI: 5.75 to 6.50; p = 5.95 × 10⁻²¹¹), explaining 2.8% of the observed variation in cystatin C. Mendelian randomization analysis did not provide evidence for a causal role of cystatin C, with a causal relative risk for CVD of 1.00 per doubling cystatin C (95% CI: 0.82 to 1.22; p = 0.994), which was statistically different from the observational estimate (p = 1.6 × 10⁻⁵).

### Factors influencing serum cystatin C levels other than renal function and the impact on renal function measurement [^112LEFz8]. Kidney International (2004). Low credibility.

It is well known that serum creatinine may be used as a marker of renal function only if factors influencing creatinine production, such as age, gender, and weight, are taken into account. Serum cystatin C has been proposed as a potentially superior marker compared to serum creatinine because cystatin C levels are believed to be produced at a constant rate and not affected by such factors. However, there are limited data on factors that may influence serum cystatin C levels, and limited data comparing cystatin C-based estimates with creatinine-based estimates that adjust for these factors, particularly in individuals with normal or mildly reduced renal function.

- **Methods**: This was a cross-sectional study of 8,058 inhabitants of the city of Groningen, The Netherlands, aged 28 to 75 years. Serum cystatin C and serum creatinine levels were measured, and creatinine clearance was determined from the average of two separate 24-hour urine collections. We performed multivariate analyses to identify factors independently associated with serum cystatin C levels, adjusting for creatinine clearance. Partial Spearman correlations were obtained after adjusting for factors that may influence both serum cystatin C and creatinine levels. We also compared the goodness-of-fit (R²) of different multivariate linear regression models that included serum cystatin C and creatinine levels for the outcome of creatinine clearance.

- **Results**: Older age, male gender, greater weight, greater height, cigarette smoking, and higher serum C levels were associated with serum cystatin C levels independently of creatinine clearance.

### Cystatin C- and creatinine-based estimated glomerular filtration rate, vascular disease, and mortality in persons with diabetes in the U.S [^114QHpFh]. Diabetes Care (2014). Low credibility.

Our study has certain limitations. We relied on a single measurement of creatinine and cystatin; GFR is estimated from these filtration markers and not measured directly. As such, we cannot assess which filtration marker most closely approximates true kidney function. Additional research is needed to determine whether the confounding by age and BMI (or other unmeasured confounders such as thyroid disease) in diabetes favors eGFR cr, eGFR cys, or perhaps a combination of the two. Additionally, a single random sample of urine was used to quantify albuminuria. Despite being nationally representative, the subset of NHANES with diabetes was relatively small, with a short duration of follow-up for mortality outcomes. Some of the vascular complications were self-reported, and insofar as reporting may vary by level of eGFR, this may lead to bias. Finally, persons with more severe kidney disease are likely underrepresented in NHANES, thus limiting accuracy in the very low ranges of GFR.

In summary, this study demonstrates that using cystatin C to classify kidney function among persons with diabetes results in a higher prevalence of reduced kidney function yet the same or stronger associations with vascular complications and mortality. Future studies are needed to determine whether incorporating cystatin C measurement into clinical care and kidney function estimation would improve outcomes in persons with diabetes.

### Update on cystatin C: Incorporation into clinical practice [^111yHKyZ]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Kidney function monitoring using creatinine-based glomerular filtration rate estimation is a routine part of clinical practice. Emerging evidence has shown that cystatin C may improve classification of glomerular filtration rate for defining chronic kidney disease in certain clinical populations and assist in understanding the complications of chronic kidney disease.

- **Summary of literature**: In this review and update, we summarize the overall literature on cystatin C, critically evaluate recent high-impact studies, highlight the role of cystatin C in recent kidney disease guidelines, and suggest a practical approach for clinicians to incorporate cystatin C into practice.

### Cystatin C and cardiovascular disease: A Mendelian randomization study [^111XPeuF]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

Epidemiological studies show that high circulating cystatin C is associated with the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), independent of creatinine-based renal function measurements. It is unclear whether this relationship is causal, arises from residual confounding, or is a consequence of reverse causation.

- **Objectives**: The aim of this study was to use Mendelian randomization to investigate whether cystatin C is causally related to CVD in the general population.

- **Methods**: We incorporated participant data from 16 prospective cohorts (n = 76,481) with 37,126 measures of cystatin C and added genetic data from 43 studies (n = 252,216) with 63,292 CVD events. We used the common variant rs911119 in CST3 as an instrumental variable to investigate the causal role of cystatin C in CVD, including coronary heart disease, ischemic stroke, and heart failure.

- **Results**: Cystatin C concentrations were associated with CVD risk after adjusting for age, sex, and traditional risk factors (relative risk: 1.82 per doubling of cystatin C; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.56 to 2.13; p = 2.12 × 10⁻¹⁴). The minor allele of rs911119 was associated with decreased serum cystatin C (6.13% per allele; 95% CI: 5.75 to 6.50; p = 5.95 × 10⁻²¹¹), explaining 2.8% of the observed variation in cystatin C. Mendelian randomization analysis did not provide evidence for a causal role of cystatin C, with a causal relative risk for CVD of 1.00 per doubling cystatin C (95% CI: 0.82 to 1.22; p = 0.994), which was statistically different from the observational estimate (p = 1.6 × 10⁻⁵).

### Serum cystatin C in the United States: The Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) [^112Fd9ew]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Serum cystatin C is increasingly used as a marker of glomerular filtration rate and cardiovascular risk. However, information on serum cystatin C levels in the general population, specifically across a wide age range and different ethnicities, is lacking.

- **Objectives**: To determine nationally representative serum cystatin C levels, estimate the prevalence of increased cystatin C levels in the general population, and identify factors associated with increased cystatin C levels.

- **Study design**: Cross-sectional survey.

- **Setting and participants**: A nationally representative subsample of 7,596 participants aged 12 years or older in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey conducted between 1988 and 1994.

- **Predictors**: Age, sex, race/ethnicity, and risk factors for chronic kidney disease.

- **Outcomes**: Continuous serum cystatin C levels and serum cystatin C levels greater than 1.12 mg/L.

- **Measurements**: Cystatin C was measured in 2006 from stored sera using an automated particle-enhanced nephelometric assay.

Results showed that the overall median serum cystatin C level was 0.85 mg/L. Median levels increased steeply with age and were greater in males and non-Hispanic white persons, even in a healthy subgroup aged 20 to 39 years. The prevalence of increased serum cystatin C levels (> 1.12 mg/L) was 1% in individuals younger than 20 years, 41% in those aged 60 years or older, and greater than 50% in individuals aged 80 years or older. Among persons aged 60 years and older, factors such as older age, non-Hispanic white ethnicity, hypertension, smoking, lower levels of education, and high-density lipoprotein were associated with increased cystatin C levels.

### Cystatin C- and creatinine-based estimated glomerular filtration rate, vascular disease, and mortality in persons with diabetes in the U.S [^114WEiZ8]. Diabetes Care (2014). Low credibility.

Serum cystatin C is an alternative to serum creatinine for estimating glomerular filtration rate (GFR) since cystatin C is less influenced by age and muscle mass. Among persons with diabetes, we compared the performance of GFR estimated using cystatin C (eGFR cys) with that using creatinine (eGFR cr) for the identification of reduced kidney function and its association with diabetes complications.

- **Research design and methods**: We analyzed data from adult participants from the 1999–2002 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey with available cystatin C (N = 4,457). Kidney function was dichotomized as preserved (eGFR ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m²) or reduced (eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m²) using the 2012 Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) cystatin C and the 2009 CKD-EPI creatinine equations.

- **Results**: Among 778 persons with diabetes, the prevalence of reduced kidney function was 16.5% using eGFR cr and 22.0% using eGFR cys. More persons with diabetes were reclassified from preserved kidney function by eGFR cr to reduced kidney function by eGFR cys than persons without diabetes (odds ratio 3.1 [95% CI 1.9–4.9], P < 0.001). The associations between lower eGFR and higher prevalence of albuminuria, retinopathy, peripheral arterial disease, and coronary artery disease were robust regardless of filtration marker. Similarly, the risk of all-cause mortality increased with lower eGFR cr and eGFR cys. Only lower eGFR cys was significantly associated with cardiovascular mortality.

Conclusions indicate that more persons with diabetes had reduced kidney function by eGFR.

### The chronic kidney disease epidemiology collaboration equation combining creatinine and cystatin C accurately assesses renal function in patients with cirrhosis [^116MPvAk]. BMC Nephrology (2015). Low credibility.

Renal function has pivotal prognostic value in patients with cirrhosis. Its critical prognostic impact is indicated by the inclusion of serum creatinine (Cr) levels in the widely used MELD (Model for End-Stage Liver Disease) score, which accurately predicts 3-month mortality in cirrhosis and is widely used to determine liver transplantation priority.

An accurate evaluation of renal function is of utmost importance in patients with cirrhosis and acute-on-chronic liver failure, especially those being evaluated for transplantation. Although the serum level of Cr is an easily measurable and widely available marker of excretory renal function, it has limitations in assessing the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in patients with cirrhosis. Due to malnutrition, low protein intake, decreased Cr synthesis, and increased tubular secretion, GFR in patients with cirrhosis is overestimated when estimated by serum Cr levels.

The equations most frequently used to estimate GFR include:

- **Cockcroft Gault (CG)**
- **Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD)**
- **Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration formula (CKD-EPI)**: These equations, however, require corrections for age, gender, ethnicity, and body weight.

Estimated GFR (eGFR) based on serum levels of cystatin C (CysC) is claimed to be more accurate than Cr-based equations. CysC is a nonglycosylated low molecular weight protein of the cystatin superfamily of cysteine protease inhibitors. In renal impairment, its levels increase faster than Cr levels.

### The chronic kidney disease epidemiology collaboration equation combining creatinine and cystatin C accurately assesses renal function in patients with cirrhosis [^115zUBQ1]. BMC Nephrology (2015). Low credibility.

Accurate measurement of renal function in cirrhotic patients is still challenging. To find the best test for the determination of the true glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in cirrhotic patients, this study prospectively compared measured (m)GFR, the gold standard, with estimated (e)GFR using equations based on serum levels of creatinine and cystatin C.

- **Methods**: GFR was measured by sinistrin clearance using the bolus method in 50 patients with cirrhosis (Child Turcotte Pugh score A, B and C) and 24 age-matched healthy subjects as controls. Measured (m)GFR was compared to eGFR using bias, accuracy of 10% and 30%, as well as correlation coefficients.

- **Results**: Creatinine-based equations generally overestimated GFR in patients with cirrhosis, showing a bias (average difference between mGFR and eGFR) of -40 (CG), -12 (MDRD), and -9 (CKD-EPI-Cr) ml/min/1.73 m². Cystatin C-based equations underestimated GFR, especially in patients with Child Turcotte Pugh score C (bias 17 ml/min/1.73 m² for CKD-EPI-CysC). Of these equations, the CKD-EPI equation that combines creatinine and cystatin C (CKD-EPI-Cr-CysC) showed a bias of 0.12 ml/min/1.73 m² compared to measured GFR.

- **Conclusions**: The CKD-EPI equation that combines serum creatinine and cystatin C measurements shows the best performance for accurate estimation of GFR in cirrhosis, especially at advanced stages.

### Creatinine to cystatin-C ratio in renal cell carcinoma: A clinically pragmatic prognostic factor and sarcopenia biomarker [^116amnCd]. The Oncologist (2023). Low credibility.

**Implications for practice**: Creatinine and cystatin-C are two routine markers of kidney function obtained from blood samples. A ratio of creatinine to cystatin-C may offer a clinically practical method to identify patients with low muscle mass and at risk for worse survival in kidney cancer.

### Filtration markers may have prognostic value independent of glomerular filtration rate [^117D2N9J]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

Serum levels of creatinine, cystatin C, or β trace protein allow estimation of GFR, but whether these markers contribute additional prognostic information beyond that reflected in GFR is unknown. Here, we analyzed data from the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease study, which provided baseline levels of these markers for 816 participants with a median follow-up of 16.6 years. We examined associations between the reciprocals of these filtration markers and (125)I iothalamate GFR, expressed per SD, with kidney failure and mortality.

In univariate analysis, lower GFR and higher levels of each filtration marker were associated with a higher risk for all outcomes. After adjustment for GFR in a Cox proportional hazards model, higher creatinine was associated with a higher risk for kidney failure but a lower risk for all-cause mortality. Higher cystatin C and β trace protein were associated with a higher risk for both kidney failure and all-cause mortality. In models including either cystatin C or β trace protein, the association of GFR with all-cause mortality was no longer significant after the addition of the filtration marker, suggesting the possibility of multicollinearity.

In summary, after adjustment for GFR, levels of creatinine, cystatin C, and β trace protein each remained directly associated with kidney failure but differed with respect to their associations with mortality. These differences may be a result of non-GFR-related associations of filtration markers, residual confounding by GFR, or collinearity between the filtration markers and GFR.

### Cystatin c as a predictor of renal recovery and in-hospital mortality in patients with acute kidney injury and liver cirrhosis [^1143uPrw]. BMC Nephrology (2025). High credibility.

This study is a retrospective analysis aimed at investigating the association between baseline serum creatinine and cystatin C levels with outcomes in the form of in-hospital mortality and recovery of kidney functions in hospitalized patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) and liver cirrhosis. It demonstrated that peak serum cystatin C was a significant predictor of in-hospital mortality in these patients. In addition, baseline serum cystatin C levels were identified as significant predictors of renal recovery.

Patients with hypertension were more common in the renal recovery group compared to the non-recovery group. This unexpected finding does not suggest that hypertension directly promotes the recovery of kidney function in patients with AKI and liver cirrhosis. Rather, it may reflect other influencing factors such as patient characteristics or closer clinical monitoring among hypertensive patients. Further studies are warranted to explore the complex relationship between hypertension and AKI recovery.

Serum cystatin C level has been found to be a more sensitive marker for the estimation of kidney functions and as an early predictor of kidney dysfunction. Moreover, there is a growing body of research investigating its relationship with clinical outcomes. Several studies demonstrated a strong association between serum cystatin C and mortality in the general population, reflecting proinflammatory and proatherogenic states. Additionally, serum cystatin C was found to be significantly associated with mortality, regardless of kidney function, among elderly patients admitted to intensive care.

### Kidney disease, race, and GFR estimation [^1112owL2]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2020). Low credibility.

The assessment of GFR is central to clinical practice, research, and public health. Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes guidelines recommend the measurement of serum creatinine to estimate GFR as the initial step in GFR evaluation. Serum creatinine is influenced by creatinine metabolism as well as GFR; hence, all equations to estimate GFR from serum creatinine include surrogates for muscle mass, such as age, sex, race, height, or weight.

The guideline-recommended equation in adults (the 2009 Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration creatinine equation) includes a term for race (specified as black versus nonblack), which improves the accuracy of GFR estimation by accounting for differences in non-GFR determinants of serum creatinine by race in the study populations used to develop the equation. In that study, blacks had a 16% higher average measured GFR compared with nonblacks with the same age, sex, and serum creatinine.

The reasons for this difference are only partly understood, and the use of race in GFR estimation has limitations. Some have proposed eliminating the race coefficient, but this would induce a systematic underestimation of measured GFR in blacks, with potential unintended consequences at the individual and population levels. We propose a more cautious approach that maintains and improves the accuracy of GFR estimates and avoids disadvantaging any racial group. We suggest full disclosure of the use of race in GFR estimation, accommodation of those who decline to identify their race, and shared decision-making between health care providers and patients.

### Cystatin c-based equation to estimate GFR without the inclusion of race and sex [^114PNWLg]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2023). High credibility.

The accuracy of estimation of kidney function using routine metabolic tests, such as the measurement of serum creatinine levels, has been controversial. The European Kidney Function Consortium (EKFC) developed a creatinine-based equation (EKFC eGFRcr) to estimate the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) with a rescaled serum creatinine level. This level is divided by the median serum creatinine level among healthy persons to control for variation related to differences in age, sex, or race. Whether a cystatin C-based EKFC equation would increase the accuracy of estimated GFR is unknown.

- **Methods**: We used data from patients in Sweden to estimate the rescaling factor for the cystatin C level in adults. We then replaced rescaled serum creatinine in the EKFC eGFRcr equation with rescaled cystatin C and validated the resulting EKFC eGFRcys equation in cohorts of White and Black patients in Europe, the United States, and Africa, according to measured GFR, levels of serum creatinine and cystatin C, age, and sex.

- **Results**: Based on data from 227,643 patients in Sweden, the rescaling factor for cystatin C was estimated at 0.83 for men and women younger than 50 years of age and 0.83+0.005×(age-50) for those 50 years of age or older. The EKFC eGFRcys equation was unbiased and had accuracy similar to that of the EKFC eGFRcr equation in both White and Black patients (11,231 patients from Europe, 1,093 from the United States, and 508 from Africa) and was more accurate than the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation.

### Cystatin C, renal function, and atherosclerosis in rheumatoid arthritis [^114CWdZL]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2011). Low credibility.

We examined the hypothesis that cystatin C, a novel marker of renal function, is elevated in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and is associated with inflammation and coronary atherosclerosis.

- **Methods**: We measured serum cystatin C, creatinine, tumor necrosis factor-α, and interleukin 6 concentrations. Additionally, we recorded the coronary artery calcium score (CACS) and Modified Diet in Renal Disease estimated glomerular filtration rate in 167 patients with RA and 91 controls.

- **Results**: Cystatin C levels were higher in RA patients [median (IQR) 1.16 (0.99–1.35) mg/l] compared to controls [1.01 (0.90–1.19) mg/l; p < 0.001] and were positively correlated with erythrocyte sedimentation rate (p < 0.001), C-reactive protein (p = 0.01), 28-joint Disease Activity Score (p = 0.006), and Framingham risk score (FRS; p = 0.02). While cystatin C was correlated with CACS (p < 0.001) in RA, this association was not significant after adjusting for age, race, sex, and FRS (p = 0.44).

- **Conclusion**: Cystatin C concentrations are higher in RA than in controls and may reflect inflammation and undetected subclinical renal dysfunction. Cystatin C offers insights into the risk of atherosclerosis in RA, but this information is not independent of the data provided by conventional cardiovascular risk factors.

### Cystatin C and cardiovascular mortality in patients with coronary artery disease and normal or mildly reduced kidney function: results from the AtheroGene study [^112TjbJh]. European Heart Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Chronic kidney disease is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Cystatin C is a promising marker to reliably mirror renal function. The role of cystatin C in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and normal or mildly reduced kidney function is the subject of investigation.

In a study involving 2,162 patients across the full spectrum of CAD, baseline cystatin C concentrations were measured. Patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate of ≤ 60 mL/min per 1.73 m² (n = 295) were excluded. Complete follow-up information was available for 1,827 patients, among whom 66 cardiovascular deaths were registered during a median follow-up of 3.65 years.

Logarithmically transformed, standardized cystatin C was associated with cardiovascular death (hazard ratio: 1.94, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.59–2.37, P < 0.001). A potential threshold effect was observed; patients in the upper quartile had a 3.87-fold (95% CI: 2.33–6.42; P < 0.001) risk of mortality compared with the pooled lower quartiles. This risk association remained robust after adjustment for potential confounders, including classical risk factors and N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide.

Serum creatinine was not associated with the outcome in this group of patients with normal renal function.

Results of this prospective study show that cystatin C is a potent predictor of cardiovascular mortality beyond classical risk factors in patients with CAD and normal or mildly reduced kidney function.

### Estimating glomerular filtration rate in kidney transplantation: a comparison between serum creatinine and cystatin C-based methods [^115T98fJ]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2005). Low credibility.

Accurate measurement of GFR is critical for the evaluation of new therapies and the care of renal transplant recipients. Although not accurate in renal transplantation, GFR is often estimated using creatinine-based equations. Cystatin C is a marker of GFR that seems to be more accurate than creatinine. Equations to predict GFR based on the serum cystatin C concentration have been developed, but their accuracy in transplantation is unknown.

GFR was estimated using four equations (Filler, Le Bricon, Larsson, and Hoek) that are based on serum cystatin C and seven equations that are based on serum creatinine in 117 adult renal transplant recipients. GFR was measured using radiolabeled diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (99mTc-DTPA), and the bias, precision, and accuracy of each equation were determined. The mean (99m)Tc-DTPA GFR was 58 ± 23 ml/min per 1.73 m².

The cystatin C-based equations of Filler and Le Bricon had the lowest bias (-1.7 and -3.8 ml/min per 1.73 m²), greatest precision (11.4 and 11.8 ml/min per 1.73 m²), and highest accuracy (87 and 89% within 30% of measured GFR, respectively). These cystatin C equations remained accurate even when the measured GFR was > 60 ml/min per 1.73 m². In contrast, the creatinine-based equations were not as accurate, with only 53 to 80% of estimates within 30% of measured GFR.

Cystatin C-based equations are more accurate at predicting GFR in renal transplant recipients than traditional creatinine-based equations. Further prospective studies with repetitive measurement of cystatin C are needed to determine whether cystatin C-based estimates of GFR are consistently reliable.

### Urine cystatin C as a biomarker of proximal tubular function immediately after kidney transplantation [^11297UJw]. American Journal of Nephrology (2011). Low credibility.

Clinical methods to predict allograft function soon after kidney transplantation are ineffective.

- **Methods**: We analyzed urine cystatin C (CyC) in a prospective multicenter observational cohort study of deceased-donor kidney transplants to determine its peritransplant excretion pattern, utility for predicting delayed graft function (DGF), and association with 3-month graft function. Serial urine samples were collected for two days following transplant and analyzed blindly for CyC. We defined DGF as any hemodialysis in the first week after transplant, slow graft function (SGF) as a serum creatinine reduction of less than 70% by the first week, and immediate graft function (IGF) as a reduction of 70% or more.

- **Results**: Of 91 recipients, 33 had DGF, 34 had SGF, and 24 had IGF. Urine CyC/urine creatinine was highest in DGF for all time points. The area under the curve (95% CI) for predicting DGF at 6 hours was 0.69 (0.57–0.81) for urine CyC, 0.74 (0.62–0.86) for urine CyC/urine creatinine, and 0.60 (0.45–0.75) for percent change in urine CyC. On the first postoperative day, urine CyC/urine creatinine and percent change in urine CyC were associated with 3-month graft function.

- **Conclusion**: Urine CyC on the day after transplant differs between degrees of perioperative graft function and modestly corresponds with 3-month function.

### Genetic analysis of elevated levels of creatinine and cystatin C biomarkers reveals novel genetic loci associated with kidney function [^111dFPsn]. Human Molecular Genetics (2025). High credibility.

The rising prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD), affecting an estimated 37 million adults in the United States, presents a significant global health challenge. CKD is typically assessed using estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR), which incorporates serum levels of biomarkers such as creatinine and cystatin C. However, these biomarkers do not directly measure kidney function; their elevation in CKD results from diminished glomerular filtration.

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) based on eGFR formulas using creatinine (eGFRcre) or cystatin C (eGFRcys) have identified distinct non-overlapping loci, raising questions about whether these loci govern kidney function or biomarker metabolism. In this study, we show that GWAS on creatinine and cystatin C levels in healthy individuals reveal both non-overlapping genetic loci impacting their metabolism as well as overlapping genetic loci associated with kidney function; whereas GWAS on elevated levels of these biomarkers uncover novel loci primarily associated with kidney function in CKD patients.

### Creatinine-or cystatin C-based equations to estimate glomerular filtration in the general population: Impact on the epidemiology of chronic kidney disease [^112nyjAm]. BMC Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

The present study has illustrated large discrepancies for the prevalence of stage 3 CKD according to the biomarker used to estimate the GFR. Moving from strictly creatinine-based equations (MDRD or CKD-EPI) to cystatin C-based or combined equations will decrease prevalence of stage 3 CKD by half, which is highly significant from an epidemiological point of view. Additional studies are thus necessary before asserting we know the true prevalence of CKD in the general population.
