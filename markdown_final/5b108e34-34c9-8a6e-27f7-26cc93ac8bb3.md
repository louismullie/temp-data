## Question

Newdementia medications

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about new dementia medications. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "new" means in this context and set a reasonable timeframe. Then, I should verify which agents have truly novel mechanisms versus incremental updates. Next, I will review the highest-quality evidence for disease-modifying therapies, followed by symptomatic and repurposed options. After that, I need to check safety, eligibility, and biomarker requirements. Finally, I will synthesize practical clinical implications and highlight controversies and uncertainties that could change practice soon.

> Let me first confirm the scope so I don't miss anything important. By "new", I will focus on approvals and major advances since 2021, with emphasis on disease-modifying therapies and newly approved symptomatic agents, while acknowledging that "new" can also mean repurposed or updated formulations of older drugs. I should also distinguish Alzheimer's disease from non-AD dementias because the therapeutic landscape differs substantially, and I will keep the synthesis clinically actionable with appropriate caveats about evidence quality and access.

> Next, I should review the most consequential advances: anti-amyloid monoclonal antibodies. Lecanemab received traditional FDA approval in 2023 for early AD and showed approximately a 27% slowing of decline on CDR-SB at 18 months in Clarity AD, with consistent benefits across key secondary endpoints and robust amyloid lowering on PET, which supports disease modification rather than mere symptom relief [^112WrecB] [^114fPjVx]. Donanemab followed with full FDA approval in 2024 and demonstrated about a 35% slowing on iADRS in the low-to-medium tau subgroup and about a 22% slowing in the overall population, with a unique stopping rule based on amyloid PET clearance that can limit duration and potentially reduce exposure and cost, which is a meaningful operational innovation [^113dD3y9] [^117PRTLU] [^117MxMeZ]. Hold on, I should verify ARIA risks and monitoring: both agents carry ARIA risks, with donanemab showing higher ARIA rates but fewer infusion reactions than lecanemab, and both require baseline and serial MRIs with heightened vigilance in ApoE ε4 homozygotes, which materially affects patient selection and counseling [^114v81gj] [^114rJyzA].

> I will now examine the mechanism and why these agents matter clinically. These antibodies bind aggregated amyloid species and engage microglia to clear plaques, reducing oligomeric toxicity and downstream tau propagation, which aligns with the amyloid cascade and provides a biologically coherent rationale for disease modification in early disease stages, though clinical effect sizes are modest and vary by tau burden and disease stage [^111v96TZ] [^113EzaDU]. Wait, let me verify the tau interaction: lower tau burden at baseline predicts greater clinical benefit, reinforcing the concept that earlier intervention before extensive tangle spread yields better outcomes, which is crucial for timing decisions in practice [^111Fud2K] [^112H5ZqC].

> But wait, what about symptomatic treatments that are actually new or newly positioned. Brexpiprazole gained FDA approval in 2023 for agitation in Alzheimer's disease, becoming the first agent with a specific indication for dementia-related agitation; this is a meaningful addition given the limited, high-quality pharmacologic options for BPSD and the boxed warnings that constrain antipsychotic use in older adults with dementia [^114qngQZ]. I should double-check guideline positioning: contemporary BPSD guidance supports cautious, time-limited use of atypicals for severe agitation or psychosis after nonpharmacologic strategies, with explicit attention to risks, which fits brexpiprazole's indication and safety profile when used judiciously [^111koiqn].

> Let me consider repurposing candidates with emerging but still evolving evidence. GLP-1 receptor agonists such as semaglutide and tirzepatide are in phase 2/3 trials for AD based on neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory hypotheses, but clinical outcomes remain uncertain and heterogeneous across studies, so I should not overstate their readiness for routine AD care yet [^112zMswY]. Anti-retroviral therapy has been explored in small studies given viral hypotheses, but again, this remains investigational and should not be adopted outside trials pending stronger efficacy data [^114UG2bd]. Hold on, I should verify that I'm not conflating diabetes guidance with dementia: ADA recommendations to simplify regimens in cognitive impairment are about hypoglycemia risk, not dementia treatment, so I need to keep those separate in counseling [^112GkM3T].

> I need to ensure I address non-AD dementias because "dementia" is broader than Alzheimer's. In dementia with Lewy bodies, there are no approved disease-modifying therapies yet, but the field is pivoting toward alpha-synuclein and neuroinflammation targets, with several trials underway, so clinicians should avoid extrapolating anti-amyloid approvals to DLB despite frequent amyloid co-pathology [^11656a3Z]. For Parkinson's disease dementia, rivastigmine remains the standard symptomatic option, and there are no new disease-modifying approvals, reinforcing the need to align treatment with the underlying neurodegenerative syndrome rather than applying AD-specific immunotherapies off-label [^114kZ8Eq].

> Next, I should review safety, eligibility, and biomarker logistics because these determine real-world feasibility. Anti-amyloid antibodies require biomarker-confirmed amyloid pathology, typically via amyloid PET or CSF Aβ42/40, and increasingly blood-based biomarkers are being integrated where validated, though I should confirm that blood tests are not yet a standalone gatekeeper for all programs pending FDA clearance for that specific use-case [^112yPbga] [^1146YaUa]. MRI exclusion criteria include more than four microhemorrhages, superficial siderosis, or prior macrohemorrhage, and ApoE ε4 status should be obtained to stratify ARIA risk and inform shared decision-making, which is essential before the first infusion [^114rJyzA] [^114v81gj]. I should double-check stopping rules: donanemab's amyloid PET–guided discontinuation after clearance is a key operational feature that can reduce cumulative exposure and cost, though access to serial PET remains a bottleneck in many systems [^117MxMeZ].

> Let me synthesize clinical implications and make sure I'm not overstating benefits. These therapies mark a shift from purely symptomatic care to disease modification, but the average clinical slowing of 20–40% translates to modest absolute differences over 18–76 weeks, and benefits appear concentrated in patients with lower tau burden and earlier disease, which argues for early detection and staged interventions rather than universal use in dementia [^113EzaDU] [^111Fud2K]. Combination strategies and precision staging are on the horizon, but head-to-head data and long-term durability remain limited, so individualized risk–benefit discussions and alignment with patient goals are mandatory [^114naKTx] [^115iDht9].

> I should confirm controversies and uncertainties so counseling is balanced. Some experts question the clinical meaningfulness of small effect sizes and emphasize ARIA risks, brain volume changes, and cost, while others argue that even modest slowing can delay milestones like loss of independence, and real-world effectiveness and safety will refine our stance over time [^115iDht9] [^112qkcBb]. The field is also grappling with equitable access to biomarkers, infusion infrastructure, and long-term outcomes, which will shape uptake and policy decisions in the near term [^116DWUX4].

> Finally, I need to translate this into practical next steps. For patients with early symptomatic AD, confirm amyloid pathology with appropriate biomarkers, screen for MRI contraindications and ApoE ε4, and discuss expected benefits, ARIA risks, infusion burden, and cost. Consider donanemab when a finite-duration, clearance-guided course is appealing, and lecanemab when a fixed 18-month protocol is acceptable, while continuing cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine as indicated for symptomatic support [^113euxG9] [^114v81gj]. For agitation in AD, consider brexpiprazole after nonpharmacologic measures and with explicit informed consent regarding boxed warnings and monitoring. For non-AD dementias, avoid anti-amyloid antibodies and tailor symptomatic care to the syndrome. And for all, revisit goals of care regularly as the evidence base and access landscape evolve [^114qngQZ] [^11656a3Z].

The newest dementia medications are **anti-amyloid monoclonal antibodies** (lecanemab [^114fPjVx] and donanemab [^1165P6E2]) for early Alzheimer's disease, which slow cognitive decline by ~27–35% [^112WrecB] [^113dD3y9] but carry risks of ARIA and infusion reactions [^116qb2Ac] [^112PJ2kM]. Brexpiprazole is newly approved for **agitation in Alzheimer's dementia** [^114qngQZ] and is the first agent with this specific indication. Other emerging options include tau-targeting therapies [^111j2cYe], GLP-1 receptor agonists [^112zMswY], and stem cell therapies [^116damHK], but these remain investigational or early-phase. Current use is limited to early AD with biomarker confirmation [^112yPbga], and patients should be counseled on modest benefits and meaningful risks [^115iDht9].

### Systemic medications and dementia risk: a systematic umbrella review [^111VrbNZ]. Molecular Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Worldwide, partly due to a welcome increase in longevity, the number of people with dementia is rapidly increasing: from an estimated 44 million in 2013 to an anticipated 135 million people by 2050. Unfortunately, no cure is available for dementia, leading to interest in modulation of risk of dementia, including through pharmacological agents and drug repurposing. Some High-Income Countries (HICs) have reported a decline in the age-adjusted incidence of dementia. This decline is thought to be due to reducing risk factors, leading to increasing interest in the prevention or delay of this condition. The latest Lancet Commission review of dementia prevention suggested that interventions targeting 14 risk factors for dementia across the life-course could potentially delay or prevent up to 45% of dementia cases. These include risk factors that are treatable through systemic medications, such as hypertension, diabetes, obesity, and depression. Whether dementia risk can be modulated by systemic medications remains uncertain.

Previous studies have investigated the association between systemic medication use and dementia outcome by looking at treatment of risk factors for dementia (eg. hypertension). There has also been recent interest in direct repurposing of systemic medications (eg. glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists). Identifying agents that may modulate dementia risk is crucial given the lack of readily available disease-modifying treatments for dementia and the increasing public health urgency of this condition.

The aim of this umbrella review was to synthesise current evidence regarding systemic medication use and dementia risk, to provide an objective evaluation of evidence gaps, and to identify priorities for future research or new drug trials. We aimed to provide a broad overview on multiple medication exposures with the outcome of all-cause dementia risk.

### Defining benefit: clinically and biologically meaningful outcomes in the next-generation Alzheimer's disease clinical care pathway [^115aL5ZG]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

At present, however, there is a need to reevaluate these concepts so that they are centered more around the complex and comprehensive understanding of biomarker‐guided, targeted therapies that have an impact on both the clinical and biological course of the disease. In the context of AD, there is a lack of precise criteria to distinguish one class of therapeutics from another. Although the newer generation of investigational compounds is often considered to be biomarker‐guided, neuroprotective interventions targeting underlying disease mechanisms, the use of terms such as "biomarker‐guided therapies" or "molecular pathway‐targeting therapies" may better convey the richness and subtlety of emerging classes of drugs in AD. In the following sections, we use the term "DMTs" to address current therapeutics as referenced and discussed in the existing literature, whereas "biomarker‐guided therapies" will be used when alluding to future therapeutics and associated concepts. Ultimately, this terminology must be further differentiated to better describe the evolution of treatment options and combinations for diverse biological subgroups of patients in future clinical trials and the achievement of precision medicine in neurology and psychiatry.

It is critical that clinicians understand the potential benefits of new therapies and their effects on AD‐related biological changes, and better recognize treatment efficacy beyond measures used with previously approved AD treatments. Moreover, treatment decisions should be better informed by available biomarkers and diagnostic assessments that match the evolving understanding of AD. Implementing clear definitions and collecting necessary evidence will facilitate proper care of individuals treated with DMTs for AD and enhance the understanding of the precise meaningfulness and treatment effects such agents exert.

The current concept of clinical meaningfulness — which can be defined as descriptive and observable effects of treatment on aspects of cognition, function, and/or behavior — is limited and fails to take into account underlying biology, nosology, and patient centricity. In addition, finding consensus as to what constitutes treatment benefit for individuals with AD is challenging due to the complex and varied nature of the disease, different perspectives of important stakeholders, and the influence of measures and analyses used to explore meaningfulness. For instance, sporadic AD follows a nonlinear and dynamic progression pattern across a complex disease continuum. In AD, the clinical presentation of signs, symptoms, and diverse pathophysiological alterations affect different biological systems at different times. Therefore, an integrative, comprehensive, and multidimensional approach, taking into account spatial and temporal (ideally staging) information, is needed to define what constitutes meaningful biological and clinical benefits associated with biomarker‐guided targeted therapies for AD.

### Drug repurposing for Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders [^115jCYD3]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

The prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is growing rapidly. The global population of individuals with AD dementia is anticipated to increase from the current 57 million to 153 million by 2050. There will be a disproportionate growth of AD and other dementias in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs); by 2050 71% of patients with dementia will live in these regions. In addition to those with the dementia of AD, many more have mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or preclinical AD. Other neurodegenerative disorders (NDDs) that are growing with the aging of the global population include Parkinson's disease and related disorders such as dementia with Lewy bodies, frontotemporal dementia and associated conditions such as progressive supranuclear palsy and corticobasal degeneration, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Approval of anti-amyloid monoclonal antibodies represents an important advance in the treatment of AD but applies to an early form of the disease and rely on diagnostic and therapeutic technologies with limited availability. There are many non-amyloid processes in the pathophysiology of AD that comprise important targets for new therapeutic development –. There is an urgent need to develop new therapies that will prevent or delay the onset of the pathology or symptoms of AD/ NDDs, slow the progression of the diseases, or improve cognition, behavior, function, and other neurological abnormalities.

### Drug repurposing for Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders [^1178oqni]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Development of new treatments for AD/NDDs is complex, requires a development program that averages 13 years to complete, and frequently results in failure. Approaches to drug development that are more likely to succeed and require more limited time and financial investment could accelerate the emergence of new therapies. Repurposed drugs approved for a non-AD/non-NDD indication are a promising source of new therapies.

We describe the potential for repurposing therapeutics for AD/NDDs and note the benefits of developing a second use of an approved medicine whose pharmacokinetics, safety toxicity, and manufacturing are known. We note the role of repurposed drugs in the current AD pipeline and describe the emergence of new technologies for the identification of candidate repurposable agents. We note the advantages of repurposing as a development strategy. We describe the challenges associated with advancing repurposed drugs, particularly the limited availability of funding and sponsors for late-stage trials if the agents are generic. We suggest possible solutions for the challenges faced by repurposing and issue a call to action for legislative changes that would incentivize programs to develop repurposable generic agents for the treatment of AD/NDD. We describe the central role of repurposed agents in the AD drug development ecosystem.

### FDA approves treatment for adults with Alzheimer's disease… [^114G7Gq5]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

The U. S. Food and Drug Administration has approved Kisunla injection for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Treatment with Kisunla should be initiated in patients with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia stage of disease, the population in which treatment was studied in the clinical trials. Kisunla is administered as an intravenous infusion every four weeks. The recommended dosage is detailed in the prescribing information. Effectiveness The efficacy of Kisunla was evaluated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study in patients with Alzheimer's disease. The patients had confirmed presence of amyloid pathology and mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia stage of disease. 1736 patients were randomized 1: 1 to receive700 mg Kisunla every 4 weeks for the first 3 doses, and then 1400 mg every 4 weeks or placebo for a total of up to 72 weeks.

Patients treated with Kisunla demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in clinical decline on the Integrated Alzheimer's Disease Rating Scale compared to placebo at Week 76 in the overall population, as well as on the iADRS component scales, the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive subscale and the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study – instrumental Activities of Daily Living scale. Patients treated with Kisunla also demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in clinical decline on the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale – Sum of Boxes compared to placebo at Week 76 in the overall population. At baseline, the study population had a mean age of 73 years, with a range of 59 to 86 years. Fifty-seven percent of patients were female, 91% were White, 6% were Asian, 4% were Hispanic or Latino, and 2% were Black or African American.

The most common side effects of Kisunla were ARIA and headache. See full prescribing information for additional information on risks associated with Kisunla. Designations The FDA granted this application Fast Track, Priority Review and Breakthrough Therapy designations.

### Amyloid-lowering immunotherapies for Alzheimer disease: current status and future directions [^113EzaDU]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2025). High credibility.

The treatment of Alzheimer disease (AD) has crossed a pivotal threshold, marked by the landmark approvals of the first-ever disease-modifying therapies. These immunotherapies, specifically monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that target various amyloid-β (Aβ) species including proto-fibrillar and fibrillar forms, substantially lower levels of Aβ in the brain. The therapies have collectively demonstrated the ability to slow cognitive and clinical decline in large placebo-controlled trials, ushering a new era in the management of AD. Here, we review recent progress made in bringing amyloid-lowering mAb therapies to the clinic and explore future directions in this rapidly evolving field. We also delve into the current understanding of AD as a biological continuum, from its asymptomatic preclinical stage to its clinically overt dementia stage. We explore how this conceptualization provides a regulatory framework to evaluate amyloid-lowering mAbs across the entire spectrum of the disease. Additionally, we review key factors that affect the integration of these treatments into clinical practice.

### Principles for novel neurologic therapeutics: an AAN position statement [^1119duP1]. Neurology (2025). High credibility.

Use of potential novel therapeutics by patients to self-treat neurologic conditions — risks and recommendations: There is a proliferation of unproven treatments of neurologic diseases that have limited or no supporting data and may have potential to harm patients, and individuals with rare neurologic conditions with no currently approved therapies may be at particular risk of using these unproven treatments. A variety of compounds have been touted as being helpful for improving memory and staving off Alzheimer disease or other dementias; these approaches, many popularized in social media, offer no proven benefit and may deter patients from seeking therapies for which supporting data are available or from participating in well-designed clinical trials. The AAN believes that rigorous investigation of any treatment is necessary to determine its efficacy and ensure safety, and we recommend patients discuss any potential treatment of a neurologic condition with their neurologist.

### Effect of discontinuing antipsychotic medications on the risk of hospitalization in long-term care: a machine learning-based analysis [^111koiqn]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The use of antipsychotic medications is frequent in long-term care. From 12% to over 50% of older residents of long-term care facilities (LTCFs) in western countries receive an antipsychotic agent with large variation in prescription rates according to geographical areas and over time. In most cases, such prescriptions are outside the approved indications. In fact, with the only exception of risperidone, a second-generation agent that has been also approved for the treatment of dementia-related agitation and aggression in Europe and in Canada, the other antipsychotic medications are approved for the treatment of schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders. However, they are largely used off-label for controlling behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) such as agitation, aggression, wandering, inappropriate behavior, and sleep disturbances. Prescribing antipsychotic medications for the treatment of BPSD is common practice in spite of evidence of limited efficacy from clinical trials in older adults with dementia and serious safety concerns related to their use. Antipsychotic medications may cause relevant side effects even at therapeutic doses. Their use is particularly cumbersome in older adults with multimorbidity and polypharmacy who have increased susceptibility to develop related adverse effects such as extrapyramidal syndrome, falls, sedation, delirium, and anticholinergic effects. Over the past decade, drug regulators in several countries have issued warnings regarding an increased risk of acute cerebrovascular events and death in older adults taking antipsychotic medications. In response to these concerns, current clinical recommendations advise clinicians to avoid the use of antipsychotic medications in older adults with dementia or limit prescribing them to patients with severe BPSD after a careful evaluation of the related risks and benefits, and for a short period of time.

### Evaluation of cognitive, functional, and behavioral effects observed in EMERGE, a phase 3 trial of aducanumab in people with early Alzheimer's disease [^1124JRH1]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

1 BACKGROUND

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that exacts a profound toll on people living with AD and their care partners. Individuals with AD irreversibly lose cognitive abilities and functional independence. Until the 2021 accelerated approval of aducanumab by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the only approved pharmacological treatment options were symptomatic therapies for patients who had already reached the dementia stage of the disease. Recent clinical development efforts target the underlying disease pathology in earlier stages, with the goal of delaying disease progression and prolonging independence. Since the 2023 and 2024 FDA traditional approval of lecanemab and donanemab for the treatment of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and mild dementia due to AD, and its broader availability in the clinical setting, attention has turned to defining and reliably measuring meaningful clinical benefit in ways that translate to a broad group of stakeholders.

### A phase IIa clinical trial to evaluate the effects of anti-retroviral therapy in Alzheimer's disease (ART-AD) [^114UG2bd]. NPJ Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

While the estimated global prevalence of Alzheimer's disease dementia is frequently cited as greater than 50 million peopleand costs over a trillion dollars annually in the United States, these estimates fail to capture those in the early stages of the disease process. When looking across the Alzheimer's disease continuum, from those in the 'preclinical' stages to those with advanced dementia, the global estimates balloon to approximately 416 million people, accounting for roughly 22% of individuals over the age of 50 worldwide.

Given the high prevalence rates and mounting economic and societal burdens, efforts to develop disease-modifying treatments for Alzheimer's disease have accelerated. The FDA recently approved two treatments targeting the removal of abnormal aggregates of Aβ in the brain. While promising, these anti-amyloid treatments have yielded limited clinical results in patients with Alzheimer's disease. Similar lackluster findings have been reported for efforts targeting tau removal in the brain. While strategies to clear aggregated Aβ and tau remain promising, these proteins begin to accumulate in the brain decades prior to a clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. The nodes within the sequela of toxic events induced by Aβ or tau deposition thus provide novel pharmacological targets for mitigating disease progression.

### Alzheimer's disease outlook: controversies and future directions [^115iDht9]. Lancet (2025). Excellent credibility.

For the first time, reductions in cerebral β-amyloid pathology load and rate of cognitive and functional decline have been achieved in Alzheimer's disease, through pharmacological intervention in randomised controlled trials. However, the results from phase 3 randomised controlled trials of anti-β amyloid monoclonal antibodies are interpreted in different ways, with some experts supporting a clinically meaningful disease-modifying effect, and others judging insufficient benefit-to-risk ratio and opposing market authorisation. In the final paper of this Series, we discuss these contrasting views, all of which wish to contribute to improvements in the quality of life of people with, or at risk of, Alzheimer's disease. We contrast the efficacy, societal costs, and generalisability of monoclonal antibodies for Alzheimer's disease to biologics for other conditions (eg, cancer, multiple sclerosis, and rheumatoid arthritis) and set this debate in the larger context of modern personalised medicine. We discuss current practice implications, future developments directed to β-amyloid and non-amyloid targets that might have more clinical efficacy and less adverse effects for those with the disease, and large-scale prevention interventions for those at risk.

### The evolving therapeutic landscape of dementia with lewy bodies [^11656a3Z]. The Lancet: Neurology (2025). High credibility.

Dementia with Lewy bodies has a complex clinical presentation, with symptoms spanning cognitive, neuropsychiatric, motor, autonomic, and sleep domains. The disorder causes high morbidity, is associated with high caregiver burden, and can result in considerable health-care costs. Although symptomatic treatments remain scarce, emerging evidence supports a multipronged approach that integrates pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions that target different signs and symptoms. Novel frameworks, such as the DIAMOND Lewy toolkit, provide structured management guidance. Beyond symptom control, research is at a turning point, with increasing focus on disease-modifying therapies. Ongoing clinical trials are exploring many therapeutic targets, including α-synuclein aggregation and neuroinflammation. Other potential targets in the treatment of dementia with Lewy bodies include amyloid β, given that the presence of Alzheimer's disease copathology is common in patients with this disease.

### Modernizing diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease: a review of global trends and Asia-specific perspectives [^112bzaws]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

A Japanese government report from 2014 projected that by 2025, 6.75 million people in Japan would have dementia. However, the latest 2024 estimates revised this number to ≈ 4.71 million, a reduction of nearly 2 million. This decline is likely attributed to healthier lifestyle choices, such as declining smoking rates. Despite this encouraging trend, government statistics from 2022 show that only 0.79 million AD patients were receiving consistent medical care, highlighting the need for improved health‐care availability and support structures in Japan. Addressing this care gap requires a multifaceted approach that builds a dementia‐friendly society. Key strategies include prioritizing early detection, providing community‐based care, and reducing the stigma associated with dementia. By fostering early detection and diagnosis and better integration of care at the community level, Japan can move toward improving the quality of life for individuals with dementia.

In Japan, advancements in AD treatment have accelerated with the recent approval of amyloid‐lowering therapies. Lecanemab, approved in 2023, and the pending approval of donanemab represent significant progress in targeting Aβ accumulation. Japan's latest dementia prevalence data projects a decrease in elderly dementia rates from 15% in 2012 to 12% by 2025attributed to lifestyle improvements, although rates of MCI are expected to rise. This suggests an emphasis on early‐stage AD interventions to prevent conversion from MCI to dementia.

The Basic Act on Dementiasupports these trends, promoting an inclusive society in which individuals with dementia can express their abilities. The Act emphasizes public–private partnerships (PPPs) for fostering clinical trial environments, involving patients and families. Japan's trial‐ready cohort program, J‐TRC, aligns with this framework, providing web‐based and in‐person assessments to streamline recruitment for trials targeting early AD stages. Now in its second term, J‐TRC integrates PPP, public involvement, and biomarker‐based pre‐screening to support early and prodromal AD research.

### Utilization of precision medicine digital twins for drug discovery in Alzheimer's disease [^112mVLuW]. Neurotherapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

AD drug development pipeline

Currently, the AD drug development pipeline is centered around two strategies: disease-modifying therapy (DMT) and symptomatic therapy. Symptomatic treatments, such as the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor Donepezil that is intended to enhance cognition, offer temporary relief from cognitive symptoms, but they do not alter the underlying disease process. In contrast, DMTs focus on addressing the underlying mechanisms of AD, such as targeting neurotransmitter receptors, neuroinflammation, amyloid beta protein processes, synaptic plasticity/neuroprotection, or tau pathology, with the goal of slowing or halting disease progression. Based on the statistics of all clinical trials on, there are currently (as of January 1, 2024) 96 DMT trials, accounting for 76 ​% of the new drugs being tested. Of these drugs, 12 ​% have a therapeutic goal of cognitive enhancement and 13 ​% are intended to treat neuropsychiatric symptoms. Among the total of 127 drugs that are reported in clinical trials for AD as of January 1, 2024, 22 ​% target neurotransmitter receptors, 20 ​% target neuroinflammation, 18 ​% target amyloid-beta protein processes, 12 ​% target synaptic plasticity and neuroprotection, 9 ​% target tau-related processes, and 6 ​% target metabolism and bioenergetics.

Notably, recent advancements in DMTs, including monoclonal antibodies like aducanumab and lecanemab, have been approved for use in slowing the cognitive decline of AD. Both aducanumab and lecanemab target the amyloid-β protein. Aducanumab has been approved for treatment of patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), while lecanemab is the first drug to receive full approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for slowing progression of mild AD. These developments of DMTs indicate a paradigm shift in Alzheimer's treatment, moving from symptomatic treatment to interventions that could potentially alter the disease trajectory. Notably, there are currently no drug development programs aimed at reversing AD and recovering function.

### The case for regulatory approval of amyloid-lowering immunotherapies in Alzheimer's disease based on clearcut biomarker evidence [^113XKtLR]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

In this context, many experts in the biology of AD agree that Aβ accumulation and amyloid deposition in plaques and vessels is an important contributor to the clinical development of AD, even in cases in which it is not formally causative. The most compelling such argument from a regulatory perspective can be made for new agents in the same therapeutic class as those that have been conventionally approved based on combined biomarker and clinical outcomes, for example, anti‐amyloid antibodies. If a new molecule in this class shows robust and significant amyloid removal (potentially targeted to < 20 CL by amyloid PET, a level considered to be in the normal range), accompanied by a detailed and acceptable safety profile, it should be allowed regulatory approval so as not to delay its availability for the myriad patients experiencing a progressive, ultimately fatal neurological disease. On the other hand, for agents that lower amyloid by a distinct molecular mechanism, the first such examples might be expected to achieve both biomarker and clinical benefits before full regulatory approval and launch.

Several arguments have been expressed against the amyloid hypothesis and the amyloid‐related perspective presented here. One argument against our position that can be — and has been — raised is that amyloid lowering per se does not necessarily interfere with an obligatory dysfunctional process of AD. However, the multiple lines of widely accepted biological evidence reviewed earlier (points #1–13), coupled with the recent, peer‐reviewed clinical trial results of plaque‐removing antibodies, contradict this argument. Related to this argument, the degree of clinical benefit derived from amyloid removal is likely to be dependent on several factors, including disease stage, cause of disease (e.g. DS), and extent of comorbidities. For example, removing amyloid in more advanced clinical and neuropathological AD has been shown to have little benefit. Continued exploration of which amyloid species (e.g. fibrillar plaques and/or diffusible oligomers/protofibrils) best predict clinical outcomes will be important.

4 OPPORTUNITIES FOR INTERVENTION

The recent regulatory approval of anti‐Aβ monoclonal antibodies is a major breakthrough for the treatment of patients at the early symptomatic stages of AD. In the Clarity AD study, lecanemab demonstrated significant improvements in biomarkers, and showed sustained treatment effects on the CDR Sum of Boxes (CDR‐SB). Similarly, the TRAILBLAZER‐ALZ 2 study demonstrated that approximately two thirds of participants treated with donanemab achieved amyloid clearance within 52 weeks, accompanied by a significant slowing of AD clinical progression as measured by Integrated Alzheimer's Disease Rating Scale (iADRS) score. The consistency of the effects across these two antibodies with slowing of clinical progression by ≈ 30% in the overall trial populations, with greater clinical benefit observed in subpopulations with evidence of lower amyloid or tau pathology at baseline, is encouraging for earlier interventions.

Such efficacy means that there is a need to better characterize patients who have achieved amyloid plaque clearance to guide clinical management and future trial inclusion. Convened by the Alzheimer's Association, a workgroup proposes the biomarker classification terminology termed treatment‐related amyloid clearance (TRAC). TRAC designations reflect that natural disease mechanisms have been altered and that there is biomarker evidence for amyloid plaque reduction. This terminology would be used to describe individuals who have (1) biomarker‐confirmed AD diagnosis prior to treatment, (2) received treatment with a drug that targets Aβ neuropathology in the brain, and (3) a follow‐up biomarker test indicative of amyloid plaque clearance, currently limited to PET. It is important to note that TRAC is a biomarker‐based classification: it reflects disease‐associated biomarker pharmacodynamic changes rather than direct neuropathological evidence. Also, it is fully expected that this framework will be adapted over time in response to rapidly evolving biomarker and clinical advances and with the accumulation of real‐world data on patients receiving anti‐Aβ monoclonal antibodies.

Rejection and approval: Lecanemab and the future of anti‐amyloid treatments

M. Bruno

Memory Clinic, Policlinico Tor Vergata, University of Rome "Tor Vergata", Rome, Italy

The advent of monoclonal antibodies targeting amyloid‐beta represents a groundbreaking shift in Alzheimer's disease (AD) treatment, offering the first disease‐modifying therapies for early‐stage AD. While these treatments have demonstrated amyloid clearance and modest slowing of cognitive decline in clinical trials, their real‐world impact remains uncertain. Strict eligibility criteria limit patient access, with studies indicating that only a fraction of individuals with modest cognitive involvement qualify for treatment (1, 2). The EMA initially rejected lecanemab due to concerns over its clinical significance, as its modest cognitive benefits did not outweigh the risks, particularly amyloid‐related imaging abnormalities (ARIAs) (3). However, following further review and pressure from advocacy groups and clinicians, the EMA later granted approval, reflecting the ongoing debate over the balance between biological efficacy and meaningful clinical outcomes. Despite regulatory acceptance, the lack of long‐term efficacy data and the challenges of implementation in routine clinical practice further complicate the widespread adoption of these therapies. As global regulatory agencies take divergent stances on approval, the discussion continues over whether anti‐amyloid therapies truly alter the course of AD or merely offer biological rather than meaningful clinical benefits. Given the limitations of amyloid‐targeting approaches, there is increasing attention toward alternative therapeutic targets, such as tau pathology, neuroinflammation, synaptic dysfunction, and metabolic pathways. Ongoing research into tau‐targeting, anti‐inflammatory, and neuroprotective agents may offer more comprehensive and effective treatment options in the future. Further real‐world data and long‐term studies are essential to determine the role of current and emerging therapies in AD management.

### Plasma tau biomarkers for biological staging of Alzheimer's disease [^111Fud2K]. Nature Aging (2025). High credibility.

Main

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia worldwide, affecting more than 55 million patients. The recent approval of amyloid-β (Aβ)-targeting immunotherapies for the treatment of mild-to-moderate AD underscores the need for accessible biomarkers, not only for detecting the disease pathologies but also staging such pathologies for optimal treatment initiation and evaluating outcomes. Staging systems that model disease progression can provide a framework for detecting and monitoring pathological changes over its long course and assist in clinical decision-making. For example, evidence indicates that patients with AD who exhibit lower tau tracer uptake on positron emission tomography (PET) scans respond better to Aβ-targeting monoclonal antibody therapies, suggesting that this group may have the most favorable risk–benefit ratio for this treatment. It is likely that other therapies, such as tau-targeting therapies, will also prove to be more beneficial at certain biological disease stages. However, PET scans are costly and require specialized personnel and facilities. Implementing a panel of fluid biomarkers, especially in blood, would substantially enhance the accessibility and cost-effectiveness of biomarker-based AD staging.

### Successes and failures: the latest advances in the clinical development of amyloid-β-targeting monoclonal antibodies for treating Alzheimer's disease [^117V4iQg]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The amyloid cascade hypothesis postulated that the accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) was the first step of the Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathological process. Effective reduction of Aβ plaque load by numerous drug candidates, among which anti-Aβ monoclonal antibodies, has produced discussible clinical successes and several failures. It was questioned whether Aβ may be the principal AD pathogenic factor and a valid therapeutic target and if targeting Aβ different species could make the difference.

Areas Covered

This review article summarized successes and failures of anti-Aβ monoclonal antibody therapy for AD, delineating the latest advances for their clinical development also according to their target engagement and downstream biomarkers.

Expert Opinion

The preliminary success of the recent Phase III randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of lecanemab, donanemab, and remternetug, and lessons learned from the failure of previous anti-Aβ monoclonal antibodies RCTs, provided critical evidence to support the role of Aβ in AD pathogenesis. The loss of free Aβ instead of an Aβ toxicity may promote AD neuropathology. Cerebrospinal fluid analyses (i.e. increases in Aβ 1–42) may indicate a potential benefit of anti-Aβ monoclonal antibodies in AD and downstream biomarkers should be considered for providing comprehension in cognitive and clinical efficacy of future AD RCTs.

### Quetiapine fumarate [^1117msVH]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide).

Patients should be advised of the following issues and asked to alert their prescriber if these occur while taking quetiapine.

Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis

Patients and caregivers should be advised that elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with atypical antipsychotic drugs are at increased risk of death compared with placebo. Quetiapine is not approved for elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.1)].

Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors

Patients, their families, and their caregivers should be encouraged to be alert to the emergence of anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia (psychomotor restlessness), hypomania, mania, other unusual changes in behavior, worsening of depression, and suicidal ideation, especially early during antidepressant treatment and when the dose is adjusted up or down. Families and caregivers of patients should be advised to look for the emergence of such symptoms on a day-to-day basis, since changes may be abrupt. Such symptoms should be reported to the patient's prescriber or health professional, especially if they are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patient's presenting symptoms. Symptoms such as these may be associated with an increased risk for suicidal thinking and behavior and indicate a need for very close monitoring and possibly changes in the medication [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2)].

Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS)

Patients should be advised to report to their physician any signs or symptoms that may be related to NMS. These may include muscle stiffness and high fever [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.4)].

Hyperglycemia and Diabetes Mellitus

Patients should be aware of the symptoms of hyperglycemia (high blood sugar) and diabetes mellitus. Patients who are diagnosed with diabetes, those with risk factors for diabetes, or those that develop these symptoms during treatment should have their blood glucose monitored at the beginning of and periodically during treatment [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.5)].

Hyperlipidemia

Patients should be advised that elevations in total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and triglycerides and decreases in HDL-cholesterol may occur. Patients should have their lipid profile monitored at the beginning of and periodically during treatment [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.5)].

### Maximizing the benefit and managing the risk of anti-amyloid monoclonal antibody therapy for Alzheimer's disease: strategies and research directions [^114cmm45]. Neurotherapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

All trials with anti-amyloid MABs that have been completed so far are in populations of patients with early AD defined as MCI due to AD or mild AD dementia. Prevention trials are in progress for both lecanemab and donanemab. Current prevention trials focus on individuals who are cognitively normal and have biomarker evidence of AD pathology in the brain. The goal of therapy is to delay the onset of cognitive decline. Prevention beginning earlier in the disease cycle can be envisioned involving cognitively normal at-risk individuals without evidence of AD pathology with the goal of therapy being delay of onset of biomarkers followed by confirmation of delay of onset of clinical symptoms. The delay in biomarker appearance might provide the basis for accelerated approval. Earlier intervention may interrupt disease progression prior to the occurrence of extensive brain injury leading to better outcomes, and treating with MABs before deposition of vascular amyloid may reduce ARIA and increase the safety of treatment. Further pursuit of prevention strategies will depend in part on the outcome of the ongoing prevention trials.

### Lecanemab approval in EU: what should we be ready for?-the EANM perspective [^1157e194]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2025). Medium credibility.

Another advantage of amyloid PET, the marker of aggregated Aβ, is the ability to monitor response to anti-amyloid therapies. Fluid biomarkers, being sensitive to dynamic changes of amyloidopathy, are not recommended for monitoring amyloid load under disease-modifying therapies. Thus, amyloid PET rather than CSF Aβ proteins have been used as a secondary end point in clinical trials of anti-amyloid therapies so far. As discussed previously, we foresee a relevant potential for repeated amyloid PET to guide therapy dosage and duration. In this context, adaptation of the centiloid scale to harmonize the quantification of amyloid PET images with the different radiotracers is essential. In fact, the centiloid scale has been used to select and monitor patients in a prospective phase 3 trial of Donanemab, another promising anti-amyloid antibody, which is currently under review by the EMA. Specifically, Aβ load reduction was re-evaluated using PET at 24 and 52 weeks. Patients receiving Donanemab were transitioned to a placebo if PET quantification at these intervals met predetermined stopping criteria, which was achieved by 52% of patients in the treatment group. Considering the significant patient burden and costs of Aβ-targeting monoclonal antibodies, a limited duration of therapy could substantially improve cost-effectiveness. While the standard pipeline for calculation of the centiloid values seems to be robust, caution needs to be made regarding the potential influence of reconstruction PET parameters on the centiloid value.

### From metabolism to mind: the expanding role of the GLP-1 receptor in neurotherapeutics [^112zMswY]. Neurotherapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs), initially approved for diabetes and obesity, are now under investigation for neuroprotective effects in a range of neurological disorders. These agents, whose receptors are widely expressed in brain regions involved in cognition and metabolism, modulate neurotransmitter release and promote neurogenesis. While preclinical studies consistently demonstrate benefits in models of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), clinical trial outcomes have been variable, largely owing to heterogeneity in study populations and trial design. Newer agents, such as NLY01 and tirzepatide, are under development to enhance central nervous system penetration and efficacy. Although GLP-1RAs are generally safe in metabolic conditions, their use in neurological diseases requires careful monitoring and patient selection. Future directions include developing reliable biomarkers, implementing precision medicine strategies, and exploring the use of combination therapies to maximize therapeutic potential.

### Aripiprazole lauroxil (Aristada) [^115HMVXs]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-related Psychosis

Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death. Analyses of 17 placebo-controlled trials (modal duration of 10 weeks), largely in patients taking atypical antipsychotic drugs, revealed a risk of death in drug-treated patients of between 1.6 to 1.7 times the risk of death in placebo-treated patients. Over the course of a typical 10-week controlled trial, the rate of death in drug-treated patients was about 4.5%, compared to a rate of about 2.6% in the placebo group.

Although the causes of death were varied, most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (e.g., heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (e.g., pneumonia) in nature. Observational studies suggest that, similar to atypical antipsychotic drugs, treatment with conventional antipsychotic drugs may increase mortality. The extent to which the findings of increased mortality in observational studies may be attributed to the antipsychotic drug as opposed to some characteristic(s) of the patients is not clear. ARISTADA is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

5.2 Cerebrovascular Adverse Reactions, Including Stroke

In placebo-controlled trials with risperidone, aripiprazole, and olanzapine in elderly patients with dementia, there was a higher incidence of cerebrovascular adverse reactions (cerebrovascular accidents and transient ischemic attacks) including fatalities compared to placebo-treated patients. ARISTADA is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

5.3 Potential for Dosing and Medication Errors

Medication errors, including substitution and dispensing errors, between ARISTADA and ARISTADA INITIO could occur. ARISTADA INITIO is for single administration in contrast to ARISTADA which is administered monthly, every 6 weeks, or every 8 weeks [see Dosage and Administration

Alzheimer's Association Clinical Practice Guideline on blood-based biomarkers in specialized care settings — using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach, the guideline provides formal recommendations that translate complex scientific data into clear, actionable recommendations and specifically provides guidance on whether blood tests for Alzheimer's disease should be used in specialized care settings as part of a comprehensive diagnostic process by providers with training and experience in the diagnosis of memory disorders. The rationale includes that multiple blood-based biomarkers (BBMs) have become available as promising and accessible alternatives for detecting AD pathology and that recent regulatory approvals of new amyloid targeting therapies for AD require biomarker confirmation of amyloid pathology to determine treatment eligibility. BBMs have been incorporated into the recently revised criteria for diagnosis and staging of AD by a workgroup of the Alzheimer's Association, yet the absence of a formal Clinical Practice Guideline (CPG) remains a critical barrier to the consistent and evidence-based application of BBMs in real-world settings, which this CPG aims to address by integrating BBMs into the diagnostic workflows of AD in cognitively impaired individuals in the care of memory disorder specialists in specialized care settings.

### Nutraceuticals intervention in Alzheimer's disease: from farm to pharma [^112GunYA]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease and a leading cause of dementia, profoundly affecting individuals worldwide. However, there are limited therapeutic approaches to treat AD, with current approaches primarily focused on providing symptomatic relief rather than halting the disease progression, highlighting the need for alternative strategies. Nutraceuticals, which are derived from natural sources, offer a promising alternative because of their multi-targeted mechanisms that modulate inflammation, oxidative stress and neurodegeneration, addressing key symptoms of AD pathology. Studies from clinical trials state the challenges of bioavailability and efficacy of nutraceuticals. Advancements and refinements in food processing and delivery methods, along with personalized nutrition, offer a possible approach to overcome these drawbacks. Future directions rely on combination therapies incorporating nutraceuticals to enhance the bioavailability and efficacy of these compounds. This approach could pave way for innovative solutions of elevating nutraceuticals from farm to pharma that offer sustainable solutions to mitigate AD globally.

We recommend suspending treatment in patients with symptoms of ARIA, even if symptoms are mild. For eligibility, the authors state they do not recommend excluding patients under age 60 or over age 85 and do not require tau PET or quantitative amyloid PET thresholds for treatment, while they continue to restrict treatment initiation to patients in AD Clinical Stages 3–4 (mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia). Though the current iteration of the AUR require PET or CSF confirmation of AD pathology, the Work Group indicates that if a specific blood test is cleared by the FDA, shows equivalent diagnostic accuracy to CSF or PET and meets stated performance requirements, it would be deemed appropriate for determining eligibility for Aβ‑targeting therapy. The AUR are intended as recommendations, not criteria, guidelines or requirements.

### Lecanemab (Leqembi) [^1125kRmr]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

After the 79-week double-blind, placebo-controlled period of Study 1, patients could enroll in an open-label extension period for up to 260 weeks, which was initiated after a gap period (range 9 to 59 months; mean 24 months) off treatment.

Study 2

In Study 2, 1795 patients were enrolled and randomized 1:1 to receive intravenous infusion of LEQEMBI 10 mg/kg or placebo once every 2 weeks. Of the total number of patients randomized, 69% were ApoE ε4 carriers and 31% were ApoE ε4 non-carriers. Overall median age of patients was 72 years, with a range of 50 to 90 years. Fifty-two percent were women, and 1381 (77%) were White, 303 (17%) were Asian, and 47 (3%) were Black.

The randomization was stratified according to clinical subgroup (mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia stage of the disease); the presence or absence of concomitant approved therapies for Alzheimer's disease at baseline (cholinesterase inhibitors and the N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist memantine); ApoE ε4 carrier status; and geographical region.

The primary efficacy outcome was change from baseline at 18 months in the CDR-SB. Key secondary endpoints included change from baseline at 18 months for the following measures: amyloid Positron Emission Tomography (PET) using Centiloids, ADAS-Cog14, and Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living Scale for Mild Cognitive Impairment (ADCS MCI-ADL).

Lack of data from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Adverse Event System makes analyses of the risks of newly approved anti-Alzheimer's antibodies inadequate to determine whether such risks justify the minimal clinical benefits reported. A recent disproportionate analysis in the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease by Ge et al. is a case in point. Among serious adverse effects, it only addresses amyloid associated imaging abnormalities, whereas the even more threatening ones, brain tissue loss and therapy-related death, are not mentioned. We urge the FDA to prioritize monitoring of all adverse effects and encourage transparency from the drug manufacturers.

### Allogeneic mesenchymal stem cell therapy with laromestrocel in mild Alzheimer's disease: a randomized controlled phase 2a trial [^116damHK]. Nature Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

Main

AD is a devastating and progressive neurocognitive disorder representing the primary cause of dementia –. Until recently, AD treatments lacked disease-modifying effects and an AD diagnosis led to inevitable and disabling cognitive decline in all affected individuals. Attempts to modify the disease have focused largely on the amyloid and neurofibrillary tangle hypotheses of disease pathogenesis. After many failures of monoclonal antibodies attempting to remove amyloid proteins from the brain, three drugs were approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) between 2021 and 2024.

In a phase 3 trial of lecanemab, randomization to active treatment resulted in a 27% improvement in Clinical Dementia Rating scale sum of boxes (CDR-SB) at 18 months –. Despite this therapeutic advance, lecanemab is associated with a 21.5% risk of amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIAs), and the possibility of continued progression of brain atrophy. Additionally, lecanemab resulted in a 26.4% rate of infusion-related reactions that can be devastating for a patient. Aducanumab carried a 35% risk of ARIA-edema (ARIA-E) and 19% risk of ARIA-hemorrhage (ARIA-H). Further, a third anti-amyloid drug, donanemab, carries a 36.8% risk of ARIAs (ARIA-E or ARIA-H), with drug-induced inflammation and brain bleeding reported. Accordingly, it is imperative to continue to develop novel therapeutic strategies.

### Maximizing the benefit and managing the risk of anti-amyloid monoclonal antibody therapy for Alzheimer's disease: strategies and research directions [^113P7GjJ]. Neurotherapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

Anti-amyloid monoclonal antibodies (MABs) are the first agents approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as disease-targeted therapies (DTTs) for the treatment of early Alzheimer's disease (AD). They change one of the defining pathophysiological features of the disease: the presence of amyloid plaques. Anti-amyloid MABs represent a new chapter in the treatment of AD And provide a foundation for developing more efficacious, safer, and more convenient MABs as well as other types of DTTs for AD and other neurodegenerative disorders. Aducanumab (Aduhelm®), lecanemab (Leqembi®), and donanemab (Kisunla®) have been approved by the FDA and some MABS have been approved in other global regions. The anti-amyloid MAB landscape is evolving; aducanumab has been discontinued and new anti-amyloid MABS are being developed. Anti-amyloid MABS do not improve symptoms of arrest progression of AD; they slow clinical decline and offer patients with AD the opportunity to function at a higher level for a longer time. Use of anti-amyloid MABs requires the early detection of AD, the use of biomarkers to diagnose AD, and adjustments of healthcare systems to ensure safe delivery of these therapies. With expanded application, anti-amyloid MABs can change many aspects of human aging. Use of anti-amyloid MABs in patient care makes new demands on clinicians as well as imposing new requirements on healthcare delivery systems. Successful implementation of anti-amyloid MAB therapy and extension of this treatment to appropriately defined patients depend on developing strategies for integrating advances of scientific understanding into patient care systems.

Consider the benefit of LEQEMBI for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and potential risk of serious adverse events associated with ARIA when deciding to initiate treatment with LEQEMBI [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Clinical Studies (14)].

WARNING: AMYLOID RELATED IMAGING ABNORMALITIES

See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning.

Monoclonal antibodies directed against aggregated forms of beta amyloid, including LEQEMBI, can cause amyloid related imaging abnormalities (ARIA), as ARIA with edema (ARIA-E) and ARIA with hemosiderin deposition (ARIA-H). ARIA is usually asymptomatic, although serious and life-threatening events can occur. ARIA can be fatal. Serious intracerebral hemorrhages > 1 cm have occurred in patients treated with this class of medications. ARIA-E can cause focal neurologic deficits that can mimic ischemic stroke. (5.1, 6.1)

ApoE ε4 Homozygotes

Patients treated with this class of medications, including LEQEMBI, who are ApoE ε4 homozygotes have a higher incidence of ARIA, including symptomatic and serious ARIA, compared to heterozygotes and noncarriers. Testing for ApoE ε4 status should be performed prior to initiation of treatment to inform the risk of developing ARIA. Prior to testing, the risk of ARIA across genotypes and implications of genetic testing results should be discussed with patients. (5.1)

### Donanemab: appropriate use recommendations [^111yni3M]. The Journal of Prevention of Alzheimer's Disease (2025). High credibility.

Donanemab appropriate use recommendations — positioning relative to lecanemab emphasizes non-interchangeability of trial data and ARIA risk considerations. Donanemab joins lecanemab as the second Aβ-targeting antibody to receive full FDA approval based on evidence of clinical benefit in placebo-controlled randomized trials. Patients in TRAILBLAZER-ALZ2 were more clinically and biologically advanced than those in CLARITY-AD; therefore, direct comparisons of safety and efficacy between the two trials are not valid. Keeping that caveat, observed rates of ARIA in the phase 3 trials were higher with donanemab than lecanemab. Another noted difference is the potential for limited duration of donanemab treatment versus the more open-ended duration of lecanemab, including a lower frequency maintenance dosing schedule following 18 months of bi-weekly treatment; ultimately, in lieu of a head-to-head trial, one cannot make evidence-based recommendations for choosing between the two.

4.1 IMPLICATIONS FOR CLINICAL TRIAL DESIGN AND COMBINATION THERAPIES

The integration of biomarkers into AD diagnostic criteria has profoundly impacted clinical trials by enhancing the alignment of symptoms with underlying pathology. As a result, clinical trials are now better equipped to predict treatment responses, as well as the safety and tolerability of therapeutic interventions by looking at a biologically homogeneous sample. Furthermore, the standardized framework that these criteria provide enables earlier intervention, which is crucial for slowing disease progression in affected individuals. By operationalizing these criteria into clinical trial designs, the research community can effectively implement this new approach in moving earlier with greater phenotypic accuracy.

Given the current limits of amyloid‐based therapies alone in symptomatic disease, exploring therapies not related to amyloid remains essential. In addition, the advent of amyloid‐lowering treatment paves the way for combination trials. Multiple combinations of pharmacologic and/or non‐pharmacologic interventions are possible. The best combination will likely depend on the biological disease stage being targeted to match the evolution of processes that drive each stage. Combining amyloid and tau‐based therapies is a promising strategy and is being explored in DIAN‐TU Tau NexGen (ClinicalTrials.gov Number: NCT05269394) and the Alzheimer's Clinical Trial Consortium (ACTC) Alzheimer's Tau Platform trials.

An important consideration in designing these trials is the use of placebo controls. While amyloid‐lowering treatment as active controls or background therapies could enhance enrollment, they require adjustments to sample size, analysis methods, and biomarker‐based outcome assessments. A 2 × 2 factorial design offers a rigorous evaluation of combination therapies but demands a substantial sample size and requires the feasibility of being randomized to each of the interventions. To address these challenges, trials like the Alzheimer's Tau Platform have adopted a partial factorial design without a placebo group.

Taken together, biomarker advancements have revolutionized AD clinical trials, improving the alignment of symptoms with pathology and enabling more targeted interventions. Anti‐Aβ monoclonal antibodies have the potential for slowing disease progression, while new frameworks such as TRAC guide more precise treatment evaluations. The global shift toward early interventions and combination therapies highlights a promising future for AD research and patient care, with evolving trial designs poised to advance treatment efficacy and disease management strategies.

### Bridging the gap: efficacy of combined therapies for cognitive, behavioral, and functional outcomes in Alzheimer's disease-results from a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^1158ashJ]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

Moreover, rivastigmine plus cognitive stimulation and physical exercise significantly improved or maintained functional status. Preservation of activities of daily living (ADLs) is highly meaningful in the management of Alzheimer's disease, as it can delay nursing home admission, lessen caregiver burden, and enhance patients' quality of life. Therefore, beyond statistical significance, the magnitude and direction of effects observed in this study suggest that several interventions, particularly combined pharmacological and non-pharmacological therapies, may offer real-world benefits for patients and healthcare systems.

However, our study has several limitations. The evidence supporting the benefits of combined pharmacotherapies-non-pharmacotherapies is limited due to quantity and quality of available studies. Further RCTs directly comparing combined pharmacotherapies-non-pharmacotherapies with pharmacotherapies or non-pharmacotherapies alone, are needed to validate these findings. Many included studies were classified as having some concern or high risk of bias, potentially affecting the reported outcomes, especially for interventions, such as herbal remedies which may have overestimated effects. Additionally, inconsistency was detected in the NMAs of both cognitive and functional outcomes, indicating disagreement between direct and indirect evidence. This inconsistency may impact the validity and interpretability of the overall findings, potentially reflecting differences in the characteristics of the included studies, such as variations in baseline populations or study design. However, sensitivity analyses that excluded studies with different characteristics yielded consistent networks and provided robust findings that were comparable to the full analyses. Moreover, asymmetrical comparison- adjusted funnel plots for cognitive and functional outcomes suggest the presence of heterogeneity or publication bias or both; for the latter, smaller studies with positive results are more likely to be published, potentially skewing the overall findings.

Further study

Our SR-NMA did not encompass drugs targeting amyloid-β, like lecanemab, donanemab, and gantenerumab. This omission stems from the ongoing debate regarding whether these drugs yield clinically significant effects. As a result, it is imperative to gather more evidence regarding the effectiveness of this class of drugs to conduct a comprehensive comparison of their efficacy in enhancing cognitive outcomes for AD patients in the future.

Anti-amyloid MABs have adverse events including infusion reactions and amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA). The latter are usually asymptomatic but can have serious consequences and occasionally result in death. Optimal use of anti-amyloid MABs involves knowledge of risk factors for ARIA, vigilance for evidence of ARIA in patients receiving treatment, and active management of ARIA to avoid serious outcomes.

This narrative review emphasizes the biological features of the anti-amyloid MABs, the use of anti-amyloid MABs in clinical practice, and the appropriate management of anti-amyloid MABs to optimize effectiveness and safety. The biology and management of ARIA are discussed. Phase 3 trials and endpoints are emphasized since these are most influential in regulatory and clinical decision-making. Phase 2 observations and drugs previously in development are cited when they provide insights into anti-amyloid MAB biology, clinical trials, or potential clinical use. The relationship between amyloid reduction and slowing of clinical decline is described. The meaningfulness of the drug-placebo difference observed in clinical trials of anti-amyloid MABs is discussed, and approaches to including patients who have received anti-amyloid MABs into clinical trials of novel agents are presented.

The presence of multiple anti-amyloid MABs on the market requires that clinicians have discussions with patients about treatment alternatives. Current data suggest that the efficacy of these agents is in the range of 20–40 ​% slowing of cognitive and functional decline. The available trials were performed in somewhat different populations of early AD and no direct head-to-head comparisons are available. More efficacy data may become available that will suggest differential efficacy or greater or less efficacy in specific populations. In the Phase 3 trials, donanemab had a higher rate of ARIA and a lower rate of infusion reactions than lecanemab. Donanemab is given monthly and may be stopped after amyloid clearance is achieved; lecanemab is given twice monthly for 18 months and monthly thereafter until the patient, family, and clinician decide that treatment is ineffective or unwarranted. In the Phase 3 trial, donanemab was titrated from 700 ​mg per infusion for the first three infusions followed by 1400 ​mg thereafter. Observations from a recent titration trial suggests that a titration beginning with 350 ​mg, progressing to 700 ​mg, 1050, mg and then 1400 ​mg may be associated with a lower rate of ARIA(67). This approach represents an alternative titration schedule. Lecanemab has weight-dependent dosing of 10 ​mg/kg and is not titrated. MRIs are obtained at baseline and before the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 7th infusions of donanemab. MRIs are required at baseline and before the 5th, 7th, and 14th infusions of lecanemab. Monthly maintenance dosing of lecanemab after the first 18 months of twice monthly dosing is approved, and subcutaneous administration is being studied. Both agents have black box warning regarding the higher risk of ARIA in APOE4 homozygotes. Discussion of these features of anti-amyloid MABs with patients and family members will be key to ensuring treatment adherence with optimal benefit and minimal risk for the patient.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

The effectiveness of KISUNLA for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease was established by Study 1, which assessed Dosing Regimen 1 (700 mg every 4 weeks for the first 3 doses, and then 1,400 mg every 4 weeks). Study 2 was conducted to assess different titration regimens, including Dosing Regimen 2 (doses every 4 weeks with 350 mg the first infusion, 700 mg the second infusion, 1,050 mg the third infusion, and then 1,400 mg every 4 weeks) that demonstrated comparable pharmacodynamic effects on amyloid plaque reduction with a reduced incidence of ARIA-related events compared to Dosing Regimen 1 [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

Study 1

The efficacy of KISUNLA was evaluated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study (Study 1, NCT04437511) in patients with Alzheimer's disease (patients with confirmed presence of amyloid pathology and mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia stage of disease, consistent with Stage 3 and Stage 4 Alzheimer's disease). Patients were enrolled with a Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score of ≥ 20 and ≤ 28 and had a progressive change in memory function for at least 6 months. Patients were included in the study based on visual assessment of tau PET imaging with flortaucipir and standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR). Patients were enrolled with or without concomitant approved therapies (cholinesterase inhibitors and the N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist memantine) for Alzheimer's disease. Patients could enroll in an optional, long-term extension.

In Study 1, 1736 patients were randomized 1:1 to receive 700 mg of KISUNLA Dosing Regimen 1 (N = 860) or placebo (N = 876) for a total of up to 72 weeks. The treatment was switched to placebo based on amyloid PET levels measured at Week 24, Week 52, and Week 76. If the amyloid plaque level was < 11 Centiloids on a single PET scan or 11 to < 25 Centiloids on 2 consecutive PET scans, the patient was eligible to be switched to placebo.

### The China Alzheimer report 2025 [^112hD4dZ]. General Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

Lecanemab

In January 2024, the National Medical Products Administration of China officially approved lecanemab for marketing in China. Phase IIb and III clinical trials demonstrated that after 18 months of treatment, lecanemab significantly reduced Aβ deposition in the brain and slowed the decline in cognitive function and quality of life scores, with the rate of decline in clinical dementia scores reduced by approximately 27%, indicating substantial long-term efficacy. However, lecanemab led to infusion-related reactions in 26.4% of participants, and 12.6% experienced ARIA, such as oedema or effusion. According to statistics, approximately 2000 patients in China have received treatment with lecanemab, following the USA and Japan. This reflects the widespread acceptance and promising outlook in China. Chinese clinicians' clinical experience suggests ARIA incidence in Chinese patients with AD may be lower than the global Clarity AD study data, but this needs validation. A prospective real-world study (ChiCTR2400087134) in China aims to assess monoclonal antibody safety and efficacy in patients with AD, including ARIA data. Its results will offer targeted evidence for the Chinese population. Meanwhile, the Yuyuan Community Health Service Centre in Shanghai has successfully achieved a breakthrough in applying lecanemab at the community level by effectively integrating community resources. The centre has also innovatively introduced the 'Yuyuan Model', which is actively promoting the adoption and application of lecanemab in China.

Donanemab

Donanemab is a humanised IgG1 antibody targeting a specific epitope (the N-terminal pyroglutamate at position 3). The results of the Phase III clinical trial (TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2) indicated that donanemab slowed the decline in the primary endpoint of the integrated AD Assessment Scale by 35% compared with the control group. It also slowed the decline in the key secondary endpoint, CDR, by 36%. Participants with low or moderate tau pathology have greater cognitive benefits, and 47% of patients with early-stage AD showed no further worsening of clinical AD symptoms after treatment with donanemab. Similar to other monoclonal antibodies of the same class, the primary adverse reaction of donanemab is ARIA with oedema. Currently, donanemab has become the second approved anti-Aβ antibody marketed in China by the National Medical Products Administration of China, effective 18 December 2024.

### Neuroinflammatory mechanisms linking high-fat diets to Alzheimer's disease vulnerability: beyond the amyloid hypothesis [^114Pakz5]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

There are many hallmark characteristics of AD. The most notable are neurofibrillary tau tangles and amyloid beta (Aβ) plaques. Many researchers have hypothesized that these pathologies are causative in disease development and progression. There are two US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)‐approved disease‐modifying treatments, aducanumab and lecanemab, which successfully reduce Aβ and mildly reduce tau pathology. Patients with low levels of Aβ burden even see a complete clearance. However, these treatments, in addition to another Aβ‐reducing treatment, semagacestat, have been controversial and have had varying levels of success, with patients lacking major improvements in memory function and overall outcome. Lecanemab has been the most successful with 27% of patients seeing modest reductions in progression over an 18 month study. Aducanumab has been pulled from the market after massive criticism for the fast‐tracked FDA approval it garnered after clinical trials failed to show substantial evidence of its efficacy. Additionally, many patients treated with Aβ monoclonal antibodies have unfortunately faced adverse outcomes. Aducanumab, lecanemab, and donanemab, a newer drug under review for approval by the FDA, all have the common, potentially life‐threatening side effect of amyloid‐related imaging abnormalities (ARIAs). These include vasogenic edema (ARIA‐E) and cerebral microhemorrhage events (ARIA‐H), which occurred at the rates of 21% to 40%. Further, the pursuit of clearing Aβ plaque pathology was largely based on the famous 2006 Nature paper, which had shown Aβ to be causative in disease development. However, this paper was recently found to be falsified. In 2012 and 2013, a tau monoclonal antibody was tested in clinical trials but was unsuccessful in improving patient outcomes. The results of these clinical trials, coupled with the recent Nature paper controversy, strongly suggest that Aβ plaque and tau pathologies are likely not the root cause. This is further supported by findings that show plaque burden does not always correlate to cognitive function, as individuals with high plaque burden can maintain normal cognitive function and vice versa. Because this approach has been largely unsuccessful, an alternative idea is gaining traction. That is, Aβ and tau pathology may be a byproduct of disease processes after significant synaptic impairment. Research promoting this idea shows there is a great need for further understanding of disease mechanisms.

### Donanemab: appropriate use recommendations [^112TA4kW]. The Journal of Prevention of Alzheimer's Disease (2025). High credibility.

Donanemab mechanism and target — Donanemab recognizes an N-terminally truncated form of Aβ with a pyro-glutamate at the third amino acid (N3pE Aβ) that lacks aspartate-1 and alanine-2; this modified form constitutes a small minority (~1–3%) of Aβ peptides in AD brain tissue, and the N3pE variant comprises < 3% of Aβ peptides in most brains.

Three monoclonal antibodies directed against specific forms of the amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide have been granted accelerated or traditional approval by the FDA as treatments for Alzheimer disease, representing the first step towards bringing disease-modifying treatments for this disease into clinical practice. Here, we review the detection, underlying pathophysiological mechanisms and clinical implications of amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA), the most impactful adverse effect of anti-Aβ immunotherapy. ARIA appears as regions of oedema or effusions (ARIA-E) in brain parenchyma or sulci or as haemorrhagic lesions (ARIA-H) in the form of cerebral microbleeds, convexity subarachnoid haemorrhage, cortical superficial siderosis or intracerebral haemorrhage. Analysis of the radiographic appearance of ARIA, its clinical risk factors and underlying neuropathology, and results from animal models point to a central role for cerebral amyloid angiopathy - a condition characterized by cerebrovascular Aβ deposits - as a key component, either as a direct target for antibody-mediated inflammation or as recipient of Aβ mobilized from plaques in the Alzheimer brain parenchyma. The great majority of ARIA occurrences are associated with mild or no clinical symptoms. However, ~5% of all ARIA events are severe enough to result in hospitalization, permanent disability or death and thus raise challenging clinical questions regarding patient selection and use of concomitant agents. Therefore, identifying novel approaches to predicting, modelling, preventing and treating ARIA remains a key step towards allowing safe use of anti-Aβ immunotherapy for the world's rapidly ageing population.

7 CLINICAL TRIAL DESIGN AND ENROLLMENT IN STUDIES OF TAUOPATHIES

Successfully addressing tauopathies requires the capability to confirm the biological disease diagnosis, drawing lessons from anti‐amyloid trials. Although specific biomarkers for primary tauopathies remain lacking, recent advances offer promise for differentiating between different tauopathiesand tracking tau tangle accumulation in the brain. Notably, early‐phase trials targeting tau in AD have demonstrated measurable biological changes. For example, BIIB080, an antisense oligonucleotide targeting the MAPT transcript gene, has shown a dose‐dependent sustained reduction in tau levels in CSF, which is associated with reduced tau burden in the brain. Furthermore, while the dominant approach in tau‐targeted therapy currently involves immunotherapy, the precise tau epitope to target remains under investigation. Recent evidence suggests the potential significance of targeting seed‐competent tau. Promising interim results from tau immunotherapy (E2814) targeting two sites of the MTBRhighlights the potential for second‐generation anti‐tau monoclonal antibodies, building on the growing understanding of tau pathophysiology.

### Commentary [^112L3dVW]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2025). Medium credibility.

But why has schizophrenia research been so limited in the number of shots on goal to find novel treatments for what is one of the most devastating illnesses to face humanity? One of the concerns expressed by Horan et al regarding drug development for CIAS was the cost of these programs. Here, it is helpful to compare CIAS to other disease areas, where investments are orders of magnitude greater than for CIAS. As an example within CNS, phase 3 trials for CIAS have cost far less than the average phase 3 trial for Alzheimer's disease, which requires a longer duration and expensive assessments such as MRI and PET. In fact, there were a whopping 878 phase 3 trials in Alzheimer's disease from 1995 to 2021, costing over $24 billion, dwarfing the magnitude of the drug development effort for cognition in schizophrenia. And while 5 of the programs during that period (and two since 2022, lecanemab and donanemab) have been successful in identifying drugs that can reduce the progressive cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease in phase 3, the cognitive benefit has been small, with the largest of these d = 0.36. It is noteworthy that the effect sizes for lecanemab and donanemab were slightly higher than for previous drugs, possibly suggesting improvements in our understanding of Alzheimer's disease clinical trials methodology and the disease process itself.

### Decreased water exchange rate across the blood-brain barrier throughout the Alzheimer's disease continuum: evidence from Chinese data [^116QLyZb]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

1 BACKGROUND

Alzheimer's disease (AD), characterized by progressive deterioration in memory, language, and logical thinking, is the leading cause of dementia. Significant progress has been made in the diagnosis and treatment of AD. According to updated diagnostic criteria, AD exists on a continuum and is defined by its biology, rather than its syndromic presentation. Although the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved three anti‐amyloid monoclonal antibodies aimed at slowing cognitive decline in AD, the safety and efficacy of these immunotherapies with anti‐amyloid beta (Aβ) antibodies remain controversial. Therefore, identifying new therapeutic targets for AD requires a deeper understanding of its pathogenic mechanisms.

The blood–brain barrier (BBB) is a highly selective, semipermeable interface that protects the central nervous system (CNS) from exposure to toxins and pathogens in the blood. A previous study has shown that BBB breakdown is an early biomarker in individuals with early cognitive dysfunction, independent of Aβ and tau biomarkers. Animal studies have demonstrated interrelationships among BBB dysfunction and Aβ, tau, neuroinflammation, apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype, and aging. A recent proof‐of‐concept trial suggested that aducanumab infusion，combined with focused ultrasound to open the BBB, resulted in a modest reduction in Aβ burden among AD patients. Thus, focusing on BBB dysfunction is crucial for the early detection of AD and the in‐depth study of its pathogenic mechanisms.

### Plasma MTBR-tau243 biomarker identifies tau tangle pathology in Alzheimer's disease [^112H5ZqC]. Nature Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

Main

Amyloid β (Aβ)-targeted immunotherapies can slow cognitive and functional decline by 25–40% in symptomatic individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, accumulating evidence indicates that such therapies are more effective in symptomatic individuals with lower levels of aggregated tau in the brain. Also, as ~25% of older people have amyloid plaques without symptoms, diagnostic tests that measure amyloid plaques do not necessarily indicate that a patient's cognitive impairment is caused by AD. Therefore, biomarkers that quantify the amount of aggregated tau can facilitate identification of patients who have cognitive symptoms caused by AD and indicate the magnitude and likelihood of benefit from anti-Aβ therapies. Furthermore, there is a growing interest in tau-targeted treatments, because tau pathology correlates more strongly with clinical disease progression than amyloid. Anti-tau therapies might have additive or synergistic effects when combined with current anti-Aβ therapies and they could potentially benefit many patients with AD who have already passed the therapeutic window for anti-Aβ therapy. However, to be able to effectively develop anti-tau treatments, we need reliable, specific and accessible biomarkers that reflect tau-related pathological changes in AD.

### Donanemab: appropriate use recommendations [^117MxMeZ]. The Journal of Prevention of Alzheimer's Disease (2025). High credibility.

Amyloid positron emission tomography (PET)–based discontinuation of donanemab — trial rules and rationale — notes that a unique aspect of TRAILBLAZER-ALZ and TRAILBLAZER-ALZ2 is that treatment duration was based on amyloid plaque clearance, with amyloid PET scans performed every 6 months and switching to placebo if stopping criteria were met: single amyloid PET measurement less than 11 CL, or two consecutive measurements greater than 11 CL and less than 25 CL. Stopping donanemab dosing could also limit anti-drug antibodies, which developed in > 80% of donanemab-treated clinical trial participants, and individuals would potentially remain below typical thresholds for amyloid PET positivity (~25 CL) for years to come.

### Updated appropriate use criteria for amyloid and tau PET: a report from the Alzheimer's association and society for nuclear medicine and molecular imaging workgroup [^115VQd4e]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). High credibility.

Updated appropriate use criteria for amyloid and tau positron emission tomography (PET) — workgroup scope, methods, and key indications — are as follows: The Alzheimer's Association and Society for Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging convened a Workgroup to update previous Appropriate Use Criteria (AUC) for amyloid PET and develop the first AUC for tau PET, and "The AUC represent general guidelines and should not be considered a substitute for clinical judgment exercised in the care of individual patients". The Workgroup methods state, "The Workgroup included 14 researchers with multidisciplinary expertise. Meetings were held between June 2020 and August 2021", and using established methods, "the Workgroup identified 17 clinical scenarios in which amyloid/tau PET may be considered" with ratings "using a 9-point scale", with consensus via "a modified Delphi process" and final category assignment "Appropriate/Uncertain/Rarely Appropriate". As an overarching principle, amyloid/tau PET "should be considered in patients who: (1) have undergone a comprehensive assessment by a dementia expert; (2) Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a diagnostic possibility but uncertainty remains; and (3) knowledge of amyloid/tau PET results is expected to help establish diagnosis and guide patient management". Specific indications rated as Appropriate include: "Amyloid PET was considered 'Appropriate' to inform diagnosis of MCI or dementia due to suspected AD; clarify diagnosis when CSF biomarkers are equivocal; to inform prognosis in MCI; and to determine eligibility for amyloid-targeting therapies", and "Tau PET was considered 'Appropriate' to clarify diagnosis in patients with MCI/dementia under age 65 or those with atypical presentations; and to inform prognosis in MCI or dementia due to suspected AD".

### TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 4: a phase 3 trial comparing donanemab with aducanumab on amyloid plaque clearance in early, symptomatic Alzheimer's disease [^116ENf9U]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

1 BACKGROUND

In the amyloid cascade, the accumulation of amyloid beta (Aβ) peptide in the form of amyloid plaques (APs) in the brain is an early and necessary event in Alzheimer's disease (AD), leading to downstream events including tau pathology, synaptic loss, and neuronal death resulting in clinical symptoms of cognitive impairment and eventually dementia. Given that an abnormal level of Aβ is one of the key pathological hallmarks of AD, as defined by the 2018 National Institute on Aging–Alzheimer's Association (NIA‐AA) research framework, Aβ has been a major target and focus of AD research.

Several phase 3 trials that are ongoing (recruiting or active) or have recently been completed aim to assess the efficacy of amyloid‐targeting therapies (ATTs). The therapeutic agents aducanumab, donanemab, and lecanemab each target different epitopes or have different binding affinities to the various forms of Aβ. Although there has been mixed success of these therapies to remove amyloid, a new era of ATTs has begun with the regulatory approvals of aducanumab in 2021, lecanemab in 2023, and donanemab in 2024.

Aducanumab is a human amyloid‐targeting monoclonal antibody that selectively targets aggregated forms of Aβ, including soluble oligomers and insoluble fibrils. The efficacy of aducanumab has previously been described. The EMERGE phase 3 trial of aducanumab demonstrated a significant reduction in clinical decline, while the ENGAGE phase 3 study did not replicate this finding. The US Food and Drug Administration granted accelerated approval for clinical use of aducanumab based on its capability to reduce AP levels and because of the need for disease‐modifying therapies at that time. However, in January 2024, the manufacturer of aducanumab chose to discontinue the development and commercialization of aducanumab globally. Donanemab is a humanized immunoglobulin G1 monoclonal antibody that selectively binds the insoluble N‐terminal truncated form of Aβ (third amino acid, pyroglutamate formation [N3pG]) that is only present in mature Aβ plaques in the brain. The Aβ‐bound donanemab complex is cleared by microglial‐mediated phagocytosis. In the phase 3 TRAILBLAZER‐ALZ 2 study, treatment with donanemab reduced brain AP levels that resulted in slowing of clinical progression at the end of 18 monthsas a clinically meaningful benefit, replicating the results of the phase 2 TRAILBLAZER‐ALZ study.

1 HISTORY, GOVERNANCE, AND DATA SHARING MODELS

The Centre for Studies on the Prevention of Alzheimer's Disease (StoP‐AD Centre,) was created in 2010, at the Douglas Mental Health University Institute Research Centre, under the leadership of Dr. John C.S. Breitner, MD, MPH, Dr. Judes Poirier, PhD, and Dr. Pierre Etienne, MD as a 7‐year $13.5 million public‐private partnership supported by McGill University. The current director of the Centre is Dr. Sylvia Villeneuve, PhD, and Dr. Judes Poirier is Deputy Director. The main mission of the StoP‐AD Centre is the pursuit of innovative intersectoral studies and interventions in the preclinical, or asymptomatic, phase of Alzheimer's disease (AD), with the goal of stopping or delaying the onset of the disease. The primary resource of the StoP‐AD Centre is the PResymptomatic EValuation of Experimental or Novel Treatments for Alzheimer's Disease (PREVENT‐AD) cohort, which includes individuals cognitively unimpaired (CU) at the time of enrolment with a first‐degree family history of sporadic Alzheimer‐like dementia. Having a family history of sporadic AD is known to increase the risk of dementia by two‐ to three‐fold. These "at‐risk" individuals undergo annual detailed multimodal examinations across a diverse array of disease indicators, such as neuropsychological evaluations, biofluid collection, and neuroimaging markers.

### Tip60 HAT activators as therapeutic modulators for Alzheimer's disease [^114od38X]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Throughout the drug discovery process, we have selected for optimal pharmacokinetics properties wherever feasible. For example, Fluorine (F) substitution has been well documented to help small compounds cross blood–brain barrier (BBB) by increasing the lipophilicity of the compound. Therefore, in both of the drug design approaches, we attempted to either keep the fluorine halogen or substitute it for another hydrophobic molecule. However, there are limitations to these approaches as in general, drug discovery routinely involve multiple rounds of testing and optimization before finding the most clinically effective compounds. Therefore, future directions of this project will involve lead optimization with targeted medicinal chemistry to obtain late leads that will be tested for in vivo pharmacokinetics and efficacy in mammalian models of AD. Since AD is a complex disease involving genetic and epigenetic factors, Tip60 activators may be suitable as a combinatorial therapy along with genetic therapeutic strategies, and these small molecules provide an opportunity to explore these combination therapies.

### Lecanemab (Leqembi) [^112WrecB]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

LEQEMBI treatment met the primary endpoint and reduced clinical decline on the global cognitive and functional scale, CDR-SB, compared to placebo at 18 months (-0.45 [-27%], P < 0.0001).

Statistically significant differences (P < 0.01) between treatment groups were also seen in the results for ADAS-Cog14 and ADCS MCI-ADL at 18 months, as presented in Table 10.

Both ApoE ε4 carriers and ApoE ε4 noncarriers showed statistically significant treatment differences for the primary endpoint and all secondary endpoints. In an exploratory subgroup analysis of ApoE ε4 homozygotes, which represented 15% of the trial population, a treatment effect was not observed with LEQEMBI treatment on the primary endpoint, CDR-SB, compared to placebo, although treatment effects that favored LEQEMBI were observed for the secondary clinical endpoints, ADAS-Cog14 and ADCS MCI-ADL. Treatment effects on disease-relevant biomarkers (amyloid beta PET, plasma Aβ42/40 ratio, plasma p-tau 181) also favored LEQEMBI in the ApoE ε4 homozygous subgroup.

Starting at six months, across all time points, LEQEMBI treatment showed statistically significant changes in the primary and all key secondary endpoints from baseline compared to placebo; see Figure 2.

### Donanemab: appropriate use recommendations [^114EaNXo]. The Journal of Prevention of Alzheimer's Disease (2025). High credibility.

Donanemab eligibility — tau positron emission tomography (PET): Tau PET played a key role in the inclusion criteria for TRAILBLAZER-ALZ2; participants were excluded if they showed no evidence of neocortical tau tracer uptake based on visual assessment, and patients with neocortical tau PET retention were stratified into those with low/medium tau (68% of all randomized participants) versus those with high tau (32% of all randomized participants). At present, tau PET is primarily a research tool and clinical access to the FDA-approved tau PET radiotracer, 18F-flortaucipir (Tauvid), is extremely limited in the United States; if available, tau PET can be used to individualize the estimate of clinical benefit for a particular patient, including risk/benefit decisions. Given current limitations, it is expected that the majority of patients receiving donanemab in the near future will have unknown tau PET status, and the clinical benefit of donanemab has not been definitively established in such patients.

### Glymphatic and meningeal lymphatic dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease: mechanisms and therapeutic perspectives [^117PVMP7]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive memory impairment and cognitive decline, severely impairing patients' quality of life and shortening life expectancy. AD has become a critical public health challenge and imposes substantial economic burdens on families and society, with its global prevalence projected to exceed 100 million by 2050. According to the China Alzheimer Report 2024, there are currently nearly 17 million dementia patients in China, accounting for approximately 30% of the global total. AD is the most common type of dementia among older people.

The classical pathological model of AD centers on extracellular amyloid‐β (Aβ) deposition and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles composed of hyperphosphorylated tau. However, this model does not fully explain the failure of clearance mechanisms. Although the anti‐Aβ monoclonal antibody lecanemab has been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for mild AD, its efficacy and safety remain controversial. Reported adverse events include amyloid‐related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) of the hemorrhagic (ARIA‐H) and edematous (ARIA‐E) types, infusion‐related reactions, and even death.

Biological aspects of Amyloid and Anti-Amyloid monoclonal antibodies

Amyloid exists along a continuum of species of varying molecular weights and aggregation states (Fig. 1). Amyloid monomers are produced by enzymatic degradation of the amyloid precursor protein (APP). Beta-site amyloid precursor protein (APP) cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE 1) is the first step in the sequential proteolytic cleavages leading to generation of amyloid beta protein (Aβ). Gamma-secretase removes the C-terminal fragment of soluble APPβ produced by BACE1 creating the Aβ monomer. The 42 ​amino acid form of the Aβ is more aggregation prone than species with other amino acid compositions. Aggregation of monomers leads to dimers, trimers, and more complex species eventually forming oligomers, protofibrils, and fibrils that aggregate into amyloid plaques (Fig. 1). In laboratory studies, the greatest neurotoxicity resides in the oligomeric species that disrupts synaptic plasticity and function, stimulates hyperphosphorylation of the tau protein to form neurofibrillary tangles, and activates a neuroinflammatory response. The amyloid cascade comprises the conceptual framework for understanding the role of Aβ in AD and provides the foundation for the development of anti-amyloid therapeutics.

Fig. 1
Species of amyloid-beta protein (Aβ) beginning with monomers and aggregating to form amyloid plaques (© J Cummings, 2025; M de la Flor, PhD, Illustrator).

The putative mechanism of plaque-lowering anti-amyloid MABs is to produce amyloid clearance by labeling aggregated species expressing the target epitope and activating microglia to engulf and consume the amyloid, reducing the abundance of the targeted amyloid species (Fig. 2). Microglia may degrade soluble Aβ primarily by secreting insulin degrading enzyme whereas their clearance of aggregated insoluble Aβ and plaques may result from phagocytosis. Whether activated microglia engulf only the antibody-decorated pathologies or engulf other regional aggregates is uncertain. Peripherally originating monocytes/macrophages may play a role in central inflammatory responses when they enter the brain through a compromised blood brain barrier (BBB) and interact with brain-resident microglia to exaggerate inflammation or may have an indirect influence through peripheral inflammatory mechanisms.

### Donanemab: appropriate use recommendations [^111vhRML]. The Journal of Prevention of Alzheimer's Disease (2025). High credibility.

Donanemab appropriate use — switching from another Aβ-targeting monoclonal antibody: There are no clinical trials addressing switching between Aβ-targeting antibodies and no evidence-based guidelines for switching based on efficacy or safety; the Work Group states We recommend that patients be off the previous agent for five half-lives prior to the initiation of the alternative antibody. Prior to switching, a repeat amyloid PET should be obtained, and if amyloid plaques as assessed by PET has been reduced to below detectable levels by therapy with a previous antibody ("treatment-related amyloid clearance"), treatment with donanemab should not be initiated. If amyloid PET remains positive, a new baseline brain MRI should be obtained prior to starting donanemab, and patients should not be treated if they meet MRI exclusion criteria, and patients should not be switched from one monoclonal antibody to another if they meet any of the other safety stopping rules. If patients are switched to donanemab from another anti-amyloid monoclonal antibody, donanemab should be initiated as when initiating therapy in a treatment-naive patient.

### Targeted protein degradation with bifunctional molecules as a novel therapeutic modality for Alzheimer's disease&beyond [^115vnd2a]. Neurotherapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

Outlook

The field of TPD is rapidly evolving with new modalities to target different proteins for degradation by cellular pathways, with publications occurring in fast succession. The combination of advances in structural biology, target-ligand design and modeling, PET probe development, and the ability to screen large chemical libraries for novel warheads against POIs and moieties that bind to UPS or ALP machinery components will enable the identification of ways to direct novel targets to degradation. ALP-based TPD technologies are still in their infancy compared to PROTACs, and more in-depth studies regarding their mechanism of autophagy engagement are needed to advance them toward drug development and pre-clinical stage. Anti-Aβ and tau immunotherapies have paved the way in supporting the hypothesis that the removal of pathogenic proteins in AD is disease-modifying and potentially even preventative, giving further validity to TPD as an approach for the treatment of AD. This is expected to also be beneficial to the field of tauopathies in general, as for all others, besides AD, no disease-modifying therapies are currently available, providing a clear area of unmet medical need that TPD is poised to address to realize the promise of precision medicine for neurodegeneration.

### A community-led initiative to de-risk and advance Parkinson's disease therapeutic targets [^114JUisj]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Parkinson's disease (PD) affects 6–11 million people worldwide, making it the second most common neurodegenerative disorder after Alzheimer's disease. To manage the hallmark motor symptoms of the disease, dopamine-directed therapies and surgical approaches (deep brain stimulation, focused ultrasound ablation) remain standard treatments –. Interventions addressing other motor complications and debilitating non-motor symptoms are available, but few are approved specifically for PD. Despite extensive efforts, there are still no approved disease-modifying treatments that can effectively slow or halt the progression of PD.

The future remains promising for PD, as the therapeutic development pipeline is robust with approaches targeting the underlying biology with the intention to delay its progression. Indeed, recent estimates suggest more than half of treatments in current clinical testing seek disease modification –. Targets identified through genetic studies, such as alpha-synuclein, LRRK2, and GBA1, have been central to these efforts, and several programs are now testing agents directed against these targets in advanced phases of clinical testing. Even if these initial approaches are successful in demonstrating disease slowing in some patients, given the disease's diverse biology and heterogeneous nature, a broad range of therapeutics, alone or in combination, will likely be needed. As results from ongoing trials begin to emerge, it is clear that the overall pipeline remains risky and thus, it is crucial to continue exploring new therapeutic targets with the potential to modify disease progression and provide symptom relief. Expanding patient datasets combined with recent advances in genome- (GWAS), transcriptome- (TWAS) and proteome-wide association studies (PWAS), as well as with other methods, have resulted in many potential therapeutic targets –. However, many lack the necessary validation data to attract interest and investment in therapeutic development. Given the high costs for developing CNS-directed therapies, estimated at an average of $1 billion per drug, and the significantly longer development timelines for disease-modifying treatments compared to symptomatic ones, companies face substantial challenges. These include the heightened risk of patent expiration stemming from prolonged clinical development and multiple trial failures. As a result, companies need to extensively de-risk and validate a target's biological relevance and potential to impact disease progression before investing heavily.

### Standardization of criteria in macCAT-T and macCAT-CR for monoclonal anti-β-amyloid antibodies: a Delphi study [^115ghTdH]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

The aim of this study was to establish a consensus standard for assessing the capacity to consent to treatment with lecanemab and donanemab, two emerging antibody therapies for Alzheimer's disease. By engaging a panel of international experts using the Delphi method, we were able to identify key features, benefits, and risks that are essential for assessing patient understanding, a critical component of capacity to consent. This standard is intended to facilitate widespread use in both clinical practice, using the MacCAT‐T, and research settings, employing MacCAT‐CR. By providing a consistent and structured approach, we aim to help clinicians and researchers guide their assessments of patient autonomy. The initial low agreement rates in Wave 1, followed by strong consensus in Wave 2, reflect the diversity within our multidisciplinary expert panel and the complexity of these novel therapies. This variation in expert prioritization underscores the need for standardized assessment criteria, as without such guidance, capacity assessments may focus on different aspects of these treatments in different clinical settings. By creating a framework that is adaptable across various clinical and research contexts, we intend to support more informed and independent decision‐making by patients regarding whether to proceed with or refuse treatment with these antibody therapies. While this standardization fully applies to treatment‐related assessments using MacCAT‐T, for research settings using MacCAT‐CR it specifically addresses understanding items related to the medications themselves (such as administration, effects, and monitoring). Additional protocol‐specific understanding items in research settings must still be individually tailored to each study's unique procedures and design as specified in the MacCAT‐CR manual.

The experts in our study highlighted several critical aspects that need to be included in any assessment of capacity to consent. Features related to the mode of administration, such as intravenous infusion and the need for regular clinical visits, were seen as central to understanding the implications of these therapies. The importance of clarifying the real‐world impact of reported benefits, such as the 37% reduction in functional decline for lecanemab and the 28% reduction for donanemab, was also highlighted. Experts warned that without clear communication, these figures could be misleading, underscoring the need for a transparent explanation of treatment outcomes. In addition, the potential risks, particularly related to neurological side effects such as brain edema and bleeding, were identified as significant concerns that need to be fully understood by patients before making a decision.

### Favorable long-term cognitive outcomes following recurrent ARIA linked to amyloid-lowering therapies: two cases [^1133ohgq]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The large-scale approval of anti-amyloid monoclonal antibodies for treating Alzheimer's disease (AD) has raised concerns about their safety due to treatment-emergent amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA).

Methods

We present two cases of patients diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment due to AD who were enrolled in the GRADUATE I clinical trial. They received subcutaneous gantenerumab every two weeks during the study period.

Results

Both patients experienced recurrent ARIA-Effusion/Edema type (ARIA-E). One developed symptomatic and severe ARIA, leading to hospitalization and study withdrawal. We report a long follow-up post-randomization (65 and 54 months), during which the adverse events did not appear to have a negative impact on disease progression. Additionally, one patient had a negative amyloid-PET over a year after treatment cessation.

Discussion

These cases suggest that recurrent ARIA-E do not inevitably lead to accelerated progression, instead, may relate to possible long-term benefits. The mechanisms underlying these findings warrant further real-life evidence.

Method

Design

This is a secondary analysis of the data from a cross-sectional descriptive survey study that focused on the people living with dementia and their caregivers' attitudes toward advanced care planning. This secondary analysis was reviewed and approved by the University of Pittsburgh Institutional Review Board (STUDY24010176).

Parent Study

Data from the parent study were collected from 13 geographically dispersed Alzheimer's Disease Research Centers (ADRCs) across the United States through surveys with caregivers of people living with dementia. Additional information about those persons living with dementia, such as demographic information and dementia-related clinical characteristics, was provided by each Center using information obtained during standardized, comprehensive assessments collected during the patients' annual visits to the ADRCs.

A total of 431 caregivers from the ADRCs located in the Southeast, Northeast, Midwest, and West regions of the United States were included. Participants completed the investigator-designed 41-item "Care Planning for Individuals with Dementia" survey containing multiple-choice questions that aimed to examine caregivers' preferences and perceptions of plans regarding end-of-life care across different stages of dementia and other relevant factors in the people living with dementia, including their knowledge about dementia. The survey was first developed based on the study team's clinical and research expertise, and then validated with six caregivers of persons with mild, moderate, or severe dementia and enrolled in the Johns Hopkins ADRC. These six caregivers completed the survey and participated in qualitative interviews about their experiences of completing the survey. Qualitative data were then analyzed for content validation and identified items that require modification to enhance clarity and understandability, and the survey was modified based on caregivers' feedback.

In the survey, the level of medical care was defined as intensive care (use of all available medical treatments), basic medical care (use of some, such as fluid maintenance, and antibiotics, but not all medical treatments), and comfort care (only use medical treatments to relieve uncomfortable symptoms, such as pain medications). In addition, other variables such as the relationship between caregivers and the persons living with dementia, the levels of impairment of the persons living with dementia (i.e. Clinical Dementia Rating;), and demographic information of caregivers and the persons living with dementia were collected as part of the Uniform Data Set and utilized as covariates. The survey was administered in person or via phone from September 2015 to September 2017.

### Novel Alzheimer disease treatments and reconsideration of US pharmaceutical reimbursement policy… [^116DWUX4]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

Rosenthal MB. Novel Alzheimer Disease Treatments and Reconsideration of US Pharmaceutical Reimbursement Policy. JAMA. 2023; 330: 505–506. doi: 10.1001/jama.2023.11702 Alzheimer disease, the most common form of dementia, affects more than 5 million US residents and progressively leads to a loss of memory and cognitive function. 1 The advent of new therapeutic agents for AD has the potential to lessen the enormous patient, family, and societal burden of illness. In this issue of JAMA, phase 3 trial results suggest that donanemab is efficacious in slowing disease progression based on the Integrated Alzheimer's Disease Rating Scale in patients with mild to moderate AD with amyloid and tau pathology. 2 Another monoclonal antibody that produced similar improvements, lecanemab, was recently awarded traditional approval by the Food and Drug Administration.

3, 4 While these new therapies have been welcomed by many stakeholders, they also will challenge the US system of pharmaceutical regulation and reimbursement. In particular — assuming FDA approval is granted — payers and policy makers must design rules that optimize value, affordability, and equity of AD care.

### A fast path from innovation to safe and effective medicines [^113UZaxA]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

Consistent progress in medicines development has allowed both for de novo treatment options and for the refinement of existing products that improve effectiveness or reduce harm. Nonetheless, unmet medical needs persist, particularly in rare diseases, pediatrics and underserved populations. The many promises of pharmacological, technological, and regulatory innovation spark new hope for patients and doctors searching for treatments, and it is therefore essential that progress made translates into the availability of new and improved medicines. We here present our vision for accelerating the path from innovation to safe and effective medicines. Our vision is driven by the continued and transparent collaboration between regulators, academia, industry, patients, and healthcare professionals. Through concrete examples and strategic initiatives, we illustrate how the EMA works with stakeholders to support continuous evolution of regulatory science, contribute to patient‐focused refinements in evidence generation and medicines assessments, and engage in forward‐looking initiatives that monitor and examine innovative developments. The ultimate goal is to future‐proof the regulatory ecosystem and ensure that scientific progress translates into meaningful health outcomes.

Figure 1: Reduction in Brain Amyloid Beta Plaque (Adjusted Mean Change from Baseline in Amyloid Beta PET Composite, SUVR and Centiloids) in Study 1

The primary endpoint was change from baseline on a weighted composite score consisting of selected items from the Clinical Dementia Rating scale Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB), MMSE, and Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale – Cognitive Subscale 14 (ADAS-Cog14) at Week 53. LEQEMBI had a 64% likelihood of 25% or greater slowing of progression on the primary endpoint relative to placebo at Week 53, which did not meet the prespecified success criterion of 80%.

Key secondary efficacy endpoints included the change from baseline in amyloid PET SUVR composite at Week 79 and change from baseline in the CDR-SB and ADAS-Cog14 at Week 79. Results for clinical assessments showed less change from baseline in CDR-SB and ADAS-Cog14 scores at Week 79 in the LEQEMBI group than in patients on placebo (CDR-SB: -0.40 [26%], 90% CI [-0.82, 0.03]; ADAS-Cog14: -2.31 [47%], 90% CI [-3.91, -0.72]).

6 ADVERSE REACTIONS

The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling:

Amyloid Related Imaging Abnormalities [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]
Hypersensitivity Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]
Infusion-Related Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

Clinical Trials with Intravenous Administration

The safety of LEQEMBI has been evaluated in 2090 patients who received at least one dose of LEQEMBI by intravenous infusion. In Studies 1 and 2 in patients with Alzheimer's disease, 1059 patients received LEQEMBI 10 mg/kg every two weeks by intravenous infusion [see Clinical Studies (14)]. Of these 1059 patients, 50% were female, 79% were White, 15% were Asian, 12% were of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity, and 2% were Black. The mean age at study entry was 72 years (range from 50 to 90 years).

In the combined double-blind, placebo-controlled period and long-term extension period of Studies 1 and 2, 1604 patients received LEQEMBI for at least 6 months, 1261 patients for at least 12 months, and 965 patients for 18 months.

In the double-blind, placebo-controlled period in Study 1, patients stopped study treatment because of an adverse reaction in 15% of patients treated with LEQEMBI, compared to 6% patients on placebo; in Study 2, patients stopped study treatment because of an adverse reaction in 7% of patients treated with LEQEMBI, compared to 3% patients on placebo. In Study 1, the most common adverse reaction leading to discontinuation of LEQEMBI was infusion-related reactions that led to discontinuation in 2% (4/161) of patients treated with LEQEMBI, compared to 1% (2/245) of patients on placebo. In Study 2, the most common adverse reaction leading to discontinuation of LEQEMBI was ARIA-H microhemorrhages that led to discontinuation in 2% (15/898) of patients treated with LEQEMBI, compared to < 1% (1/897) of patients on placebo.

### Both amyloid and tau assessments are desired before initiating disease-modifying therapy for Alzheimer disease: three real-world cases [^111hjtLm]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

A(+) T(+) and A(-) T(-) indicate symptomatic AD and non-AD, respectively. We have recently reported that cases of A(+) T(-) and A(-) T(+) may carry a risk of mistakenly linking cognitive decline to AD pathology, particularly when Aβ is the only biomarker evaluated. Here, we present 3 patients (Patients 1, 2, and 3) with amnestic mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia, who received the DMT. MMSE scores of Patients 1, 2, and 3 were 23, 23, and 24, respectively. The corresponding CDR global scores were 1, 0.5, and 0.5, respectively. All patients were confirmed to be A(+), and subsequently received lecanemab treatment. Later, they underwent tau PET using 18 F-MK-6240, and were confirmed to be T(-) (Fig. 1). Patient 1 showed PET-based Braak stage 0 (ie, no accumulation). Patients 2 and 3 showed PET-based Braak stage I/II (ie, confined to the entorhinal area). These results from tau assessments indicate that their symptoms are irrelevant to AD pathology, even if the Aβ biomarker is positive. Meanwhile, based on the phase 3 trial results, lecanemab and donanemab are currently designed to be used in patients who exhibit mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia due to AD pathology. Therefore, our 3 cases exemplify that evaluating only Aβ pathology may lead to a misdiagnosis of AD as the cause of symptoms, thereby resulting in the unanticipated use of DMT. We strongly suggest that both Aβ and tau assessments are important to relate clinical symptoms to AD pathology, and are desired to ensure the expected use and evaluation of DMT.
