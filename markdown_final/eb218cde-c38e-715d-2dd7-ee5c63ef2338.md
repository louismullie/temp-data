## Question

52 yo F with history of rheumatoid arthritis (on methotrexate and chronic prednisone), presents with cough and fever; CXR shows left lower lobe infiltrate. Sputum Gram stain: Gram-negative rods. Allergic to fluoroquinolones. Admitted for CAP, started on ceftriaxone and azithromycin. ID recommends adding linezolid for "broader coverage". Proceed with linezolid addition?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether to add linezolid to ceftriaxone plus azithromycin for a 52-year-old woman with rheumatoid arthritis on methotrexate and chronic prednisone, who has community-acquired pneumonia with a sputum Gram stain showing gram-negative rods and a fluoroquinolone allergy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and severity classification. Then, I should verify whether current empiric therapy is guideline-concordant. Next, I will assess whether there are valid indications to add MRSA coverage with linezolid. After that, I need to weigh risks and benefits of linezolid in this patient, including hematologic toxicity and drug interactions. Finally, I will consider alternatives and outline a stewardship-aligned plan with clear stop criteria and follow-up testing.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and severity. The patient has CAP with immunocompromise from RA and chronic glucocorticoids, which increases risk for severe disease and complications, but I should not jump to conclusions about severity without applying validated criteria; using CURB-65 or IDSA/ATS severe CAP criteria, I need to check for major criteria (mechanical ventilation or septic shock) and minor criteria (respiratory rate ≥ 30, multilobar infiltrates, confusion, BUN ≥ 20 mg/dL, WBC < 4000, platelets < 100,000, temperature < 36°C, hypotension requiring fluids) to classify nonsevere versus severe CAP and guide empiric therapy intensity [^9b32c384] [^d090ada5].

> Next, I should review whether the current regimen is guideline-concordant. For hospitalized nonsevere CAP without MRSA or Pseudomonas risk factors, ceftriaxone plus azithromycin is a strongly recommended first-line option; this aligns with ATS/IDSA 2019 and contemporary summaries, and the addition of a macrolide provides atypical coverage and potential immunomodulatory benefit in more severe presentations, even though recent observational data question routine macrolide benefit in nonsevere cases [^d090ada5] [^f30cc1d7] [^f63e1697] [^69ed21d2].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about adding linezolid. I need to check for valid indications for MRSA coverage. The 2019 ATS/IDSA guideline explicitly abandons the HCAP category and recommends empiric MRSA coverage only when locally validated risk factors are present, such as prior respiratory isolation of MRSA, recent hospitalization with parenteral antibiotics in the last 90 days, or other locally validated risks; immunocompromise alone is not a standalone indication for empiric MRSA therapy, so I should confirm whether any of these specific risks exist before adding linezolid [^990c32f7] [^cd7a0556].

> Wait, let me verify the significance of the sputum Gram stain showing gram-negative rods. A sputum Gram stain is nonspecific and can reflect oropharyngeal contamination; it does not, by itself, establish MRSA risk or justify adding linezolid. I should obtain cultures if MRSA or Pseudomonas is suspected based on validated risk factors, but I should not broaden therapy solely on a Gram stain interpretation without supportive epidemiology or prior history [^461a6a72] [^88dd7966].

> I will now examine the risks of adding linezolid in this patient. Linezolid carries meaningful hematologic toxicity, including thrombocytopenia and anemia, and has serotonergic drug–drug interactions; with methotrexate and chronic steroids, the cumulative marrow suppression risk is nontrivial, and the interaction potential warrants caution. Unless there is a compelling indication, the harm likely outweighs benefit here [^notfound].

> But wait, what if I am underestimating MRSA risk because of immunocompromise? Let me reconsider. While RA and steroids increase infection risk, current guidelines do not list immunocompromise alone as a reason for empiric MRSA coverage; instead, they emphasize using validated local risk factors and obtaining cultures when MRSA is suspected, then de-escalating if cultures are negative. Therefore, I should not add linezolid without a specific MRSA risk signal [^990c32f7] [^461a6a72].

> Next, I should review alternatives if I truly need broader coverage. If there were a credible MRSA risk, vancomycin would be an appropriate alternative to linezolid, with consideration of renal function and monitoring; if there were a concern for Pseudomonas, I would add an antipseudomonal beta-lactam rather than linezolid; if there were a concern for severe CAP with risk of atypical pathogens and macrolide intolerance, doxycycline could be considered as part of a beta-lactam–based regimen, though evidence is weaker and this is not the case here [^990c32f7] [^01d90257].

> I should double-check the stewardship plan and duration. For nonsevere CAP, a total of 5 days of therapy is recommended once the patient is clinically stable for 48–72 hours, with step-down to oral therapy when feasible; I need to ensure we reassess at 48–72 hours, obtain cultures if MRSA or Pseudomonas risk factors are present, and de-escalate based on results to minimize adverse effects and resistance [^760f62a6] [^88dd7966].

> Final decision: I should not add linezolid. The current ceftriaxone plus azithromycin regimen is guideline-concordant for nonsevere CAP, there is no validated MRSA risk factor present, the sputum Gram stain does not justify MRSA coverage, and the hematologic and interaction risks of linezolid are substantial in this patient. If the patient deteriorates or if cultures identify MRSA, I would then add targeted MRSA therapy and adjust accordingly [^d090ada5] [^990c32f7] [^461a6a72].

Do not add **linezolid** unless there is a specific risk factor for MRSA or severe CAP. The current regimen of ceftriaxone plus azithromycin is guideline-concordant for non-severe CAP without MRSA risk [^d090ada5], and adding linezolid without indication exposes the patient to unnecessary toxicity and cost. Reserve linezolid for **confirmed MRSA** or when **severe CAP** is present with MRSA risk factors [^990c32f7].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current ATS/IDSA guidelines recommend **empiric therapy** for hospitalized non-severe CAP without MRSA or Pseudomonas risk as a beta-lactam (ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, or ampicillin/sulbactam) plus a macrolide (azithromycin) or respiratory fluoroquinolone monotherapy [^d090ada5] [^f30cc1d7]. Ceftriaxone plus azithromycin is a **standard, evidence-based regimen** that covers typical and atypical pathogens [^f63e1697].

MRSA coverage is **not recommended** unless specific risk factors are present, such as:

- Prior respiratory isolation of MRSA
- Recent hospitalization with parenteral antibiotics in the last 90 days
- Locally validated MRSA risk factors [^990c32f7] [^cd7a0556]

The patient's RA and chronic prednisone use alone **do not meet these criteria** [^notfound].

---

## Evidence supporting current regimen

Ceftriaxone provides broad coverage for common CAP pathogens, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Enterobacteriaceae, while azithromycin covers atypical pathogens (Mycoplasma, Chlamydia, Legionella) and offers immunomodulatory benefits in severe CAP [^f63e1697] [^e09a6186]. This combination is **supported by multiple studies and guidelines** demonstrating efficacy and safety in hospitalized non-severe CAP [^d090ada5] [^f30cc1d7].

---

## Risks and drawbacks of adding linezolid

Linezolid is a potent antibiotic with significant **adverse effects**, including:

- **Hematologic toxicity**: thrombocytopenia, anemia, leukopenia
- Serotonin syndrome risk, particularly with concomitant serotonergic agents
- Gastrointestinal disturbances, including C. difficile risk
- Higher cost compared to standard regimens

Adding linezolid without a clear indication exposes the patient to these risks **without proven benefit** [^notfound].

---

## Clinical scenarios warranting linezolid addition

Linezolid should be considered only when **MRSA risk factors are present** or when severe CAP is suspected with MRSA risk. Examples include:

- Prior respiratory isolation of MRSA
- Severe CAP requiring ICU admission with MRSA risk factors
- Local epidemiology indicating high MRSA prevalence with validated risk factors [^990c32f7] [^cd7a0556]

In this case, there is **no evidence of MRSA risk** or severe CAP, so linezolid is not indicated [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

Do not add **linezolid** to the current regimen. The patient is receiving guideline-concordant therapy for non-severe CAP without MRSA risk, and adding linezolid would expose her to unnecessary toxicity and cost. Continue ceftriaxone plus azithromycin, monitor closely, and adjust therapy only if clinical deterioration occurs or if MRSA is identified [^d090ada5] [^f30cc1d7].

### Community-acquired pneumonia in adults: diagnosis and management [^30247ffd]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia is a leading cause of death. Risk factors include older age and medical comorbidities. Diagnosis is suggested by a history of cough, dyspnea, pleuritic pain, or acute functional or cognitive decline, with abnormal vital signs (e.g., fever, tachycardia) and lung examination findings. Diagnosis should be confirmed by chest radiography or ultrasonography. Validated prediction scores for pneumonia severity can guide the decision between outpatient and inpatient therapy. Using procalcitonin as a biomarker for severe infection may further assist with risk stratification. Most outpatients with community-acquired pneumonia do not require microbiologic testing of sputum or blood and can be treated empirically with a macrolide, doxycycline, or a respiratory fluoroquinolone. Patients requiring hospitalization should be treated with a fluoroquinolone or a combination of beta-lactam plus macrolide antibiotics. Patients with severe infection requiring admission to the intensive care unit require dual antibiotic therapy including a third-generation cephalosporin plus a macrolide alone or in combination with a fluoroquinolone. Treatment options for patients with risk factors for Pseudomonas species include administration of an antipseudomonal antibiotic and an aminoglycoside, plus azithromycin or a fluoroquinolone. Patients with risk factors for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus should be given vancomycin or linezolid, or ceftaroline in resistant cases. Administration of corticosteroids within 36 hours of hospital admission for patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia decreases the risk of adult respiratory distress syndrome and length of treatment. The 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide and 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccinations are both recommended for adults 65 years and older to decrease the risk of invasive pneumococcal disease, including pneumonia.

### Diagnosis and management of community-acquired pneumonia in adults [^3d1c7e5d]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia is diagnosed by clinical features (e.g., cough, fever, pleuritic chest pain) and by lung imaging, usually an infiltrate seen on chest radiography. Initial evaluation should determine the need for hospitalization versus outpatient management using validated mortality or severity prediction scores. Selected diagnostic laboratory testing, such as sputum and blood cultures, is indicated for inpatients with severe illness but is rarely useful for outpatients. Initial outpatient therapy should include a macrolide or doxycycline. For outpatients with comorbidities or who have used antibiotics within the previous three months, a respiratory fluoroquinolone (levofloxacin, gemifloxacin, or moxifloxacin), or an oral beta-lactam antibiotic plus a macrolide should be used. Inpatients not admitted to an intensive care unit should receive a respiratory fluoroquinolone, or a beta-lactam antibiotic plus a macrolide. Patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia or who are admitted to the intensive care unit should be treated with a beta-lactam antibiotic, plus azithromycin or a respiratory fluoroquinolone. Those with risk factors for Pseudomonas should be treated with a beta-lactam antibiotic (piperacillin/tazobactam, imipenem/cilastatin, meropenem, doripenem, or cefepime), plus an aminoglycoside and azithromycin or an antipseudomonal fluoroquinolone (levofloxacin or ciprofloxacin). Those with risk factors for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus should be given vancomycin or linezolid. Hospitalized patients may be switched from intravenous to oral antibiotics after they have clinical improvement and are able to tolerate oral medications, typically in the first three days. Adherence to the Infectious Diseases Society of America/American Thoracic Society guidelines for the management of community-acquired pneumonia has been shown to improve patient outcomes. Physicians should promote pneumococcal and influenza vaccination as a means to prevent community-acquired pneumonia and pneumococcal bacteremia.

### Is azithromycin the first-choice macrolide for treatment of community-acquired pneumonia? [^476194b5]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Combination treatment with a beta-lactam plus a macrolide may improve the outcome for elderly patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). The prognoses and mortality rates for elderly patients with CAP who receive ceftriaxone combined with a 3-day course of azithromycin or a 10-day course of clarithromycin were compared in an open-label, prospective study. Of 896 assessable patients, 220 received clarithromycin and 383 received azithromycin. There were no significant differences between groups with regard to the severity score defined by the Pneumonia Patient Outcomes Research Team (PORT) study group; the incidence of bacteremia was also not significantly different. However, for patients treated with azithromycin, the length of hospital stay was shorter (mean ± SD, 7.4 ± 5 vs. 9.4 ± 7 days; P < .01) and the mortality rate was lower (3.6% vs. 7.2%; P < .05), compared with those treated with clarithromycin. There might be a difference in the outcome for patients with CAP depending on the macrolide used. A shorter treatment course with azithromycin may result in better compliance with therapy.

### Efficacy of short-course antibiotic regimens for community-acquired pneumonia: a meta-analysis [^8b51906d]. The American Journal of Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose

There is little consensus on the most appropriate duration of antibiotic treatment for community-acquired pneumonia. The goal of this study is to systematically review randomized controlled trials comparing short-course and extended-course antibiotic regimens for community-acquired pneumonia.

Methods

We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and CENTRAL, and reviewed reference lists from 1980 through June 2006. Studies were included if they were randomized controlled trials that compared short-course (7 days or less) versus extended-course (> 7 days) antibiotic monotherapy for community-acquired pneumonia in adults. The primary outcome measure was failure to achieve clinical improvement.

Results

We found 15 randomized controlled trials matching our inclusion and exclusion criteria comprising 2796 total subjects. Short-course regimens primarily studied the use of azithromycin (n = 10), but trials examining beta-lactams (n = 2), fluoroquinolones (n = 2), and ketolides (n = 1) were found as well. Of the extended-course regimens, 3 studies utilized the same antibiotic, whereas 9 involved an antibiotic of the same class. Overall, there was no difference in the risk of clinical failure between the short-course and extended-course regimens (0.89, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.78–1.02). In addition, there were no differences in the risk of mortality (0.81, 95% CI, 0.46–1.43) or bacteriologic eradication (1.11, 95% CI, 0.76–1.62). In subgroup analyses, there was a trend toward favorable clinical efficacy for the short-course regimens in all antibiotic classes (range of relative risk, 0.88–0.94).

Conclusions

The available studies suggest that adults with mild to moderate community-acquired pneumonia can be safely and effectively treated with an antibiotic regimen of 7 days or less. Reduction in patient exposure to antibiotics may limit the increasing rates of antimicrobial drug resistance, decrease cost, and improve patient adherence and tolerability.

### Community-acquired pneumonia: a review [^f63e1697]. JAMA (2024). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) results in approximately 1.4 million emergency department visits, 740 000 hospitalizations, and 41 000 deaths in the US annually.

Observations

Community-acquired pneumonia can be diagnosed in a patient with 2 or more signs (eg, temperature > 38 °C or ≤ 36 °C; leukocyte count < 4000/μL or > 10 000/μL) or symptoms (eg, new or increased cough or dyspnea) of pneumonia in conjunction with consistent radiographic findings (eg, air space density) without an alternative explanation. Up to 10% of patients with CAP are hospitalized; of those, up to 1 in 5 require intensive care. Older adults (≥ 65 years) and those with underlying lung disease, smoking, or immune suppression are at highest risk for CAP and complications of CAP, including sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and death. Only 38% of patients hospitalized with CAP have a pathogen identified. Of those patients, up to 40% have viruses identified as the likely cause of CAP, with Streptococcus pneumoniae identified in approximately 15% of patients with an identified etiology of the pneumonia. All patients with CAP should be tested for COVID-19 and influenza when these viruses are common in the community because their diagnosis may affect treatment (eg, antiviral therapy) and infection prevention strategies. If test results for influenza and COVID-19 are negative or when the pathogens are not likely etiologies, patients can be treated empirically to cover the most likely bacterial pathogens. When selecting empirical antibacterial therapy, clinicians should consider disease severity and evaluate the likelihood of a bacterial infection-or resistant infection-and risk of harm from overuse of antibacterial drugs. Hospitalized patients without risk factors for resistant bacteria can be treated with β-lactam/macrolide combination therapy, such as ceftriaxone combined with azithromycin, for a minimum of 3 days. Systemic corticosteroid administration within 24 hours of development of severe CAP may reduce 28-day mortality.

Conclusions

Community-acquired pneumonia is common and may result in sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, or death. First-line therapy varies by disease severity and etiology. Hospitalized patients with suspected bacterial CAP and without risk factors for resistant bacteria can be treated with β-lactam/macrolide combination therapy, such as ceftriaxone combined with azithromycin, for a minimum of 3 days.

### Diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia. An official clinical practice guideline of the American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America [^760f62a6]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in adults — antibiotic duration and oral step-down: We recommend treating for a minimum of 5 days, with most patients achieving clinical stability within 48 to 72 hours such that a total duration of therapy of 5 days will be appropriate for most patients; when switching from parenteral to oral antibiotics, either the same agent or the same drug class should be used, and for CAP due to suspected or proven MRSA or P. aeruginosa, therapy should be 7 days.

### Severe community-acquired pneumonia: timely management measures in the first 24 hours [^e09a6186]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Early antimicrobial therapy

Common causative organisms for severe CAP include Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Legionella species, Gram-negative bacilli, Haemophilus influenzae, and influenza A and B viruses. Adherence to guidelines for empiric antibiotics is associated with improved survival (Table 1), although microbial aetiology varies across time and place, and different guidelines have proposed slightly different antimicrobial regimes. In general, however, American, British, and European guidelines all recommend empirically starting a beta-lactam (such as amoxicillin-clavulanate, ampicillin-sulbactam, cefotaxime, or ceftriaxone) plus a macrolide (such as azithromycin or clarithromycin). American and European guidelines suggest that a fluoroquinolone (such as levofloxacin or moxifloxacin) may be substituted for the macrolide.

Several systematic reviews which explored the role of macrolides in CAP have arrived at different conclusions, depending on the type of studies included. In general, lower-quality observational studies tend to suggest survival benefits, as opposed to studies on non-critically ill patients and randomised trials. Two high-quality randomised trials were recently published: a Dutch trial concluded that beta-lactam monotherapy was non-inferior to beta-lactam plus macrolide combination for 90-day mortality, but a Swiss trial could not demonstrate non-inferiority. While these trials included non-ICU patients, macrolides have immune-modulatory effects in addition to antimicrobial properties which may benefit sicker and more septic patients. Indeed, in a systematic review of 25 observational studies of 8872 patients with severe CAP, combination treatment with macrolides was associated with lower mortality compared with treatment without macrolides, including when guideline-concordant regimens of beta-lactam/macrolide and beta-lactam/fluoroquinolone were specifically compared (Table 1).

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Table 3 — bacterial pneumonia in HIV-exposed and HIV-infected children — first-choice parenteral therapy includes ceftriaxone 50–100 mg/kg body weight per dose once daily, or 25–50 mg/kg body weight per dose twice daily IV or IM (max 4 g/day), or cefotaxime 40–50 mg/kg body weight per dose 4 times daily, or 50–65 mg/kg body weight 3 times daily (max 8–10 g/day) IV; an alternative is cefuroxime, 35–50 mg/ kg body weight per dose 3 times daily (max 4–6 g/ day) IV. For children who are receiving effective cART, have mild or no immunosuppression, and have mild to moderate community-acquired pneumonia, oral therapy option would be amoxicillin 45 mg/kg body weight per dose twice daily (maximum dose: 4 g per day). Add azithromycin for hospitalized patients to treat other community-acquired pneumonia pathogens, add clindamycin or vancomycin if methicillin-resistant S. aureus is suspected, and for patients with neutropenia, chronic lung disease other than asthma (e.g. LIP, bronchiectasis) or indwelling venous catheter, consider regimen that includes activity against P. aeruginosa (such as ceftazidime or cefepime instead of ceftriaxone). Consider PCP in patients with severe pneumonia or more advanced HIV disease, and evaluate for tuberculosis, cryptococcosis, and endemic fungi as epidemiology suggests.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) outpatient antibiotic evidence — "RCTs of antibiotic treatment regimens for adults with CAP provide little evidence of either superiority or equivalence of one antibiotic regimen over another", partly due to comparators no longer available, and "We identified 16 relevant RCTs comparing two antibiotic regimens for the treatment of outpatient CAP… Meta-analyses of each of these groups of studies revealed no differences in relevant outcomes between any of the compared regimens".

### 2019 community-acquired pneumonia treatment guidelines: there is a need for a change toward more parsimonious antibiotic use [^83a95687]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

In the United States, 6 in 10 adults have one chronic disease, and 4 in 10 adults have two or more chronic diseases, so the recommendation for amoxicillin will be applicable to a minority of adults with CAP. Therefore, U.S. physicians will most likely continue to treat many patients with the Watch group respiratory fluoroquinolones, a class of antibiotics with a well-documented propensity to favor the emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance and Clostridioides difficile infections, as well as an increased risk of adverse events (U.S. Food and Drug Administration alert).

This will hamper the CDC's efforts to reduce overall antibiotic consumption and fluoroquinolone use in the United States. The Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee also suggested that guidelines should include recommendations to educate patients about antibiotic therapy when appropriate. Accordingly, the developers of the CAP guidelines could have considered providing guidance to physicians regarding the use of Access group antibiotics such as amoxicillin and doxycycline in select patients with stable comorbid conditions, along with close monitoring and adequate patient education.

Even more surprising is the listing of the Reserve group fifth-generation cephalosporin ceftaroline as a first-choice empiric treatment option for CAP (in combination with a macrolide) in hospitalized adults without risk factors for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Efficacy data from phase III trials suggesting that ceftaroline is superior to ceftriaxone with regard to clinical cure require further scrutiny, and its current listing as a first-choice option violates basic antibiotic stewardship considerations.

Given that respiratory tract infections are one of the most frequent reasons for antibiotic prescriptions worldwide, and that in many countries the U.S. treatment recommendations are still considered an important reference, it seems to us, as members of the WHO EML Antibiotics Working Group, that this represents a lost opportunity for antibiotic stewardship. We believe there is a clear need to better align all treatment guidelines to the same guiding principles, and to establish a global set of evidence-based recommendations with a focus on enhancing the use of Access group antibiotics.

ATS/IDSA community-acquired pneumonia — Inpatient severe CAP without risk factors for MRSA or P. aeruginosa should receive a β-lactam plus a macrolide (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence) or a β-lactam plus a respiratory fluoroquinolone (strong recommendation, low quality of evidence). Observational data, including a meta-analysis in critically ill patients, found macrolide-containing therapies were associated with a significant mortality reduction compared with non–macrolide-containing therapies.

### Addition of macrolide antibiotics for hospital treatment of community-acquired pneumonia [^69ed21d2]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Current guidelines recommend the use of macrolides in patients with moderate to severe CAP, to provide coverage of atypical pathogens and for their immunomodulatory effects. However, at a population level, we found no evidence that empirical macrolide combination therapy provided any benefit over β-lactam monotherapy, and atypical pathogens were rarely identified. Furthermore, in subgroup analyses by severity we found no evidence of, or even trend toward, greater potential benefits in the more severe subgroups. Conversely, previous evidence has shown that macrolide use is associated with increased antibiotic resistance and a higher risk of adverse outcomes. For example, previous macrolide use has been associated with macrolide resistance among S pneumoniae within individuals and in population-based studies; in children, mass dose azithromycin administration was associated with resistance in S pneumoniae, S aureus, and Escherichia coli. Several large cohort studies reported that azithromycin and clarithromycin were associated with higher risk of adverse cardiovascular events, on which basis the US Food and Drug Administration subsequently published warnings on the use of azithromycin. A meta-analysis on 183 RCTs reported an increased rate of gastrointestinal adverse events with macrolide use. Macrolide use can also affect microbiome composition in healthy adults. Given the known risks associated with macrolides, routine empirical use of macrolides should be carefully balanced. Nevertheless, developing better diagnostic tools to accurately identify causative pathogens would be beneficial, allowing clinicians to target antibiotic therapy more effectively and also minimize unnecessary macrolide use.

### Update in adult community-acquired pneumonia: key points from the new American Thoracic Society / Infectious Diseases Society of America 2019 guideline [^760bdc66]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America recently released their joint guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). The co-chairs of the guideline committee provide a summary of the guideline process, key recommendations from the new guideline and future directions for CAP research.

Recent Findings

The guideline committee included 14 experts from the two societies. Sixteen questions for the guideline were selected using the PICO format. The GRADE approach was utilized to review the available evidence and generate recommendations. The recommendations included expanded microbiological testing for patients suspected of drug-resistant infections, empiric first-line therapy recommendations for outpatients and inpatients including use of beta-lactam monotherapy for uncomplicated outpatients, elimination of healthcare-associated pneumonia as a treatment category, and not recommending corticosteroids as routine adjunct therapy.

Summary

CAP is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Effective antibiotic therapy is available and remains largely empirical. New diagnostic tests and treatment options are emerging and will lead to guideline updates in the future.

Regarding specific circumstances for community-acquired pneumonia, more specifically with respect to pediatric patients, antibiotic therapy, general principles, BTS 2011 guidelines recommend to administer amoxicillin as the first-line oral antibiotic in all pediatric patients due to its effectiveness against the majority of pathogens causing CAP in this group, good tolerance profile, and cost. Administer amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, cefaclor, erythromycin, azithromycin, or clarithromycin as an alternative.

### 2019 community-acquired pneumonia treatment guidelines: there is a need for a change toward more parsimonious antibiotic use [^b2bd5f95]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

To the Editor:

The American Thoracic Society (ATS) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) recently published updated guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). In the 12 years since the previous edition of the guidelines was published, the importance of incorporating antimicrobial stewardship principles into treatment guidelines has been increasingly recognized. In 2017, the U.S. Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee provided guidance regarding this issue for U.S. treatment guidelines. One of the recommendations states that "when multiple therapeutic options are available, a hierarchy of antibiotic treatment recommendations should be provided with 'first choice' options being those with adequate therapeutic efficacy, the lowest risk of facilitating antimicrobial resistance, and the lowest risk of promoting C. difficile and other adverse events, with consideration of healthcare value". The World Health Organization (WHO) recently developed the AWaRe (Access, Watch, and Reserve) framework for classifying antibiotics based on antibiotic stewardship principles, and recommends its use in treatment guidelines.

We are therefore concerned that the 2019 version of the ATS/IDSA CAP guidelines seems to give disappointingly little weight to such antibiotic stewardship principles while continuing to recommend WHO Watch and Reserve antibiotics as first-line options for CAP in most of the target populations. We suggest that Access antibiotics would be sufficient for many patients and would be preferable from an antibiotic stewardship perspective. Amoxicillin, which is the first-choice treatment for CAP based on the 2019 WHO Model List of Essential Medicines, and is also listed as a first-choice option in many guidelines outside the United States, is only recommended in the ATS/IDSA guidelines, together with doxycycline and macrolides as equivalent options, for patients without comorbidities (very broadly stated as "chronic heart, lung, liver, or renal disease; diabetes mellitus; alcoholism; malignancy; or asplenia").

Severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) treatment — patients with severe CAP should not receive empiric monotherapy, even with a fluoroquinolone, because of the range of potential pathogens and the desirability of prompt and microbiologically active therapy (AI); patients with severe pneumonia should be treated with an IV beta-lactam plus either azithromycin (AI) or a respiratory fluoroquinolone (moxifloxacin or levofloxacin [750 mg/day]) (AI); preferred beta-lactams are ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, or ampicillin-sulbactam; in patients who are allergic to penicillin, aztreonam plus a respiratory fluoroquinolone (moxifloxacin or levofloxacin [750 mg/day]) should be used (BIII); and weak observational data suggest that beta-lactam plus macrolide may be associated with decreased mortality.

### Diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia. An official clinical practice guideline of the American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America [^429450f9]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background: This document provides evidence-based clinical practice guidelines on the management of adult patients with community-acquired pneumonia. Methods: A multidisciplinary panel conducted pragmatic systematic reviews of the relevant research and applied Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation methodology for clinical recommendations. Results: The panel addressed 16 specific areas for recommendations spanning questions of diagnostic testing, determination of site of care, selection of initial empiric antibiotic therapy, and subsequent management decisions. Although some recommendations remain unchanged from the 2007 guideline, the availability of results from new therapeutic trials and epidemiological investigations led to revised recommendations for empiric treatment strategies and additional management decisions. Conclusions: The panel formulated and provided the rationale for recommendations on selected diagnostic and treatment strategies for adult patients with community-acquired pneumonia.

Outpatient community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) without comorbidities — initial antibiotic choices and macrolide use: For patients without comorbidities, the panel recommended amoxicillin 1 g every 8 hours or doxycycline 100 mg twice daily; some experts recommend that the first dose of oral doxycycline be 200 mg. In a departure from prior CAP guidelines, the panel did not give a strong recommendation for routine use of a macrolide antibiotic as monotherapy for outpatient CAP, citing a macrolide resistance rate of > 30% among S. pneumoniae isolates in the United States; however, in settings where macrolide resistance is documented to be low and there are contraindications to alternative therapies, a macrolide as monotherapy is a treatment option.

Invasive bacterial infection treatment — bacterial pneumonia in HIV-exposed/infected children: First-choice parenteral options are ceftriaxone 50–100 mg/kg body weight per dose once daily, or 25–50 mg/kg body weight per dose twice daily IV or IM (max 4 g/day), or cefotaxime 40–50 mg/kg body weight per dose 4 times daily, or 50–65 mg/kg body weight 3 times daily (max 8–10 g/day) IV; an alternative is cefuroxime 35–50 mg/kg body weight per dose 3 times daily (max 4–6 g/day) IV. For children receiving effective cART with mild/no immunosuppression and mild to moderate community-acquired pneumonia, an oral option would be amoxicillin 45 mg/kg body weight per dose twice daily (maximum dose: 4 g per day). Add azithromycin for hospitalized patients to treat common atypical pathogens; add clindamycin or vancomycin if methicillin-resistant S. aureus is suspected. In patients with neutropenia, chronic lung disease other than asthma, or an indwelling venous catheter, consider antipseudomonal regimens such as ceftazidime or cefepime instead of ceftriaxone. Consider Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) in severe pneumonia or advanced HIV disease, and evaluate for tuberculosis, cryptococcosis, and endemic fungi as epidemiology suggests.

ATS/IDSA community-acquired pneumonia — Inpatient nonsevere CAP without risk factors for MRSA or P. aeruginosa is treated empirically with either a β-lactam plus a macrolide (strong recommendation, high quality of evidence) or monotherapy with a respiratory fluoroquinolone (strong recommendation, high quality of evidence). For adults with CAP who have contraindications to both macrolides and fluoroquinolones, a third option is a β-lactam plus doxycycline (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence). The panel suggests that β-lactam monotherapy should not be routinely used for inpatients with CAP over fluoroquinolone monotherapy or β-lactam/macrolide combination therapy.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Hospitalized empiric therapy and resistant pathogens — Options for empiric therapy for HIV-infected children outside of the neonatal period who are hospitalized for suspected community-acquired bacteremia or bacterial pneumonia include ampicillin or an extended-spectrum cephalosporin (e.g., ceftriaxone, cefotaxime) (AIII). The addition of azithromycin or other macrolide can be considered for hospitalized patients with pneumonia to treat other common community-acquired pneumonia pathogens (M. pneumoniae, C. pneumoniae). If MRSA is suspected or the prevalence of MRSA is high (i.e., > 10%) in the community, clindamycin (for non-CNS infections), doxycycline (non-CNS, for children aged > 8 years) or vancomycin can be added (choice based on local susceptibility patterns). Neutropenic children also should be treated with an appropriate antipseudomonal drug with consideration for adding an aminoglycoside if infection with Pseudomonas sp. is likely, and severely immunocompromised HIV-infected children with invasive or recurrent bacterial infections require expanded empiric antimicrobial treatment covering a broad range of resistant organisms similar to that chosen for suspected catheter sepsis pending results of diagnostic evaluations and cultures (AIII).

### Clinical and bacteriological outcomes in hospitalised patients with community-acquired pneumonia treated with azithromycin plus ceftriaxone, or ceftriaxone plus clarithromycin or erythromycin: a prospective, randomised, multicentre study [^dcb7da99]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2007). Low credibility.

This study compared patients with moderate-to-severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) requiring hospitalisation, who received initial therapy with either intravenous ceftriaxone plus intravenous azithromycin, followed by step-down to oral azithromycin (n = 135), with patients who received intravenous ceftriaxone combined with either intravenous clarithromycin or erythromycin, followed by step-down to either oral clarithromycin or erythromycin (n = 143). Clinical and bacteriological outcomes were evaluated at the end of therapy (EOT; day 12–16) or at the end of study (EOS; day 28–35). At baseline, mean APACHE II scores were 13.3 and 12.6, respectively, with > 50% of patients classified as Fine Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI) category IV or V. Clinical success rates (cure or improvement) in the modified intent-to-treat (MITT) population at EOT were 84.3% in the ceftriaxone/azithromycin group and 82.7% in the ceftriaxone/clarithromycin or erythromycin group. At EOS, MITT success rates (cure only) were 81.7% and 75.0%, respectively. Equivalent success rates in the clinically evaluable population were 83% and 87%, respectively, at EOT, and 79% and 78%, respectively, at EOS. MITT bacteriological eradication rates were 73.2% and 67.4%, respectively, at EOT, and 68.3% vs. 60.9%, respectively, at EOS. Mean length of hospital stay (LOS) was 10.7 and 12.6 days, and the mean duration of therapy was 9.5 and 10.5 days, respectively. The incidence of infusion-related adverse events was 16.3% and 25.2% (p 0.04), respectively. An intravenous-to-oral regimen of ceftriaxone/azithromycin was at least equivalent in efficacy and safety to the comparator regimen and appeared to be a suitable treatment option for hospitalised patients with CAP.

### Reply to huttner: 2019 community-acquired pneumonia treatment guidelines: there is a need for a change toward more parsimonious antibiotic use [^f3594bdf]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

From the Authors:

We appreciate this additional letter submitted in response to the recently published guidelines for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in adults.

Huttner and colleagues emphasize the importance of antimicrobial stewardship principles in shaping antibiotic treatment guidelines. We strongly agree. The adult CAP guideline emphasizes that when multiple options are presented the final antibiotic choice should be influenced by local and individual patient factors. We also emphasized the importance of deescalating antibiotics when appropriate and limiting the duration of antibiotic therapy. However, our highest priority was to assure that adequate empiric treatment is provided, especially for patients with more severe CAP. We did recommend amoxicillin as monotherapy for uncomplicated outpatients, but the recommendation for expanded antibiotic therapy for outpatients with comorbidities reflected the need to cover for a broader range of potential pathogens. These outpatients represent a group that has not been clearly shown to be safely treated with β-lactam monotherapy. Ceftaroline was included as an option for treatment of inpatients with CAP given the available high-grade evidence (cited by Huttner and colleagues) that it is at least equivalent if not superior to ceftriaxone without evidence of an increased adverse event profile.

Finally, although we acknowledge that antimicrobial stewardship is relevant for all antibiotic prescribing decisions, it is important to highlight that, in a recent analysis of all outpatient antibiotic prescribing in the United States, pneumonia was only the 14th most common diagnosis, accounting for a small percentage of all antibiotics prescribed. For antimicrobial stewardship to actually impact the individual and population risks of inappropriate antibiotic prescribing, including the risks attributed to respiratory fluoroquinolones, more gains will be achieved by focusing on treatment strategies for upper respiratory infections, urinary tract infections, and gastrointestinal infections.

### Updated recommendations from the ATS and IDSA | AAFP… [^1605bed7]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

- Routine treatment of CAP with macrolide monotherapy is no longer recommended unless local resistance is low. Amoxicillin and doxycycline are preferred in low-risk patients.
- Five-day treatment courses are recommended for all patients with CAP, with reassessment following treatment. From the AFP Editors. Diagnostic Testing BLOOD AND SPUTUM CULTURES Routine blood and sputum cultures have not been shown to improve patient outcomes in CAP. Sputum cultures are recommended before treatment initiation only if the patient has severe CAP, and particularly if he or she is intubated; if the patient has a history of methicillin-resistant. Staphylococcus aureus or Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection or if he or she is being empirically treated for these pathogens; or if the patient was hospitalized and received parenteral antibiotics within the previous 90 days.

Lower respiratory tract samples from intubated patients with severe CAP should be sent for Gram stain and culture soon after intubation because of the higher risk of MRSA or P. aeruginosa infection, and because endotracheal aspirates have a higher yield than sputum samples. Blood cultures should be obtained if the patient has severe CAP; was previously or is currently being treated empirically for MRSA or P. aeruginosa infection, particularly respiratory infections; or if the patient was hospitalized and received parenteral antibiotics within the previous 90 days. The yield of blood cultures is low in adults without severe CAP, and empiric therapy is rarely changed based on these results. CORTICOSTEROID AND ANTIVIRAL THERAPY Corticosteroids should not be routinely prescribed for patients with CAP or severe influenzal pneumonia.

Although two studies showed significant improvements in outcomes when corticosteroids were prescribed for CAP, these results are questionable because of study flaws, and subsequent studies have not shown improvement in clinically relevant outcomes. Antiviral agents should be prescribed for adults with CAP who test positive for influenza, regardless of the duration of illness before diagnosis or the treatment setting. Although the benefits are greatest when antivirals are started within 48 hours of symptom onset, there is evidence supporting later initiation of therapy.

### Principles of antibiotic treatment of community-acquired pneumonia in the outpatient setting [^a75cf1c1]. The American Journal of Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a common illness with high rates of morbidity and mortality. Nearly 80% of the treatment for this condition is provided in the outpatient setting. Among the etiologic agents associated with bacterial CAP, the predominant pathogen is Streptococcus pneumoniae. Treatment of CAP for the most part is empirical; therefore, any antibiotic treatment should cover both typical and atypical pathogens. The beta-lactams have historically been considered standard therapy for the treatment of CAP. However, the impact of rising resistance rates is now a primary concern facing physicians. For patients with comorbidities or recent antibiotic therapy, current guidelines recommend either combination therapy with a beta-lactam and a macrolide or an antipneumococcal fluoroquinolone alone. Fluoroquinolones are broad-spectrum antibiotics that exhibit high levels of penetration into the lungs and low levels of resistance. Evidence from clinical trials indicates clinical success rates of > 90% for moxifloxacin, gatifloxacin, and levofloxacin in the treatment of CAP due to S pneumoniae. Data from comparative clinical trials suggest fluoroquinolone monotherapy is as efficacious as beta-lactam-macrolide combination therapy in the treatment of CAP patients. The respiratory fluoroquinolone levofloxacin has also been shown to be effective in CAP patients for the treatment of macrolide-resistant S pneumoniae. The use of azithromycin, telithromycin, and fluoroquinolones in short-course regimens has been shown to be efficacious, safe, and tolerable in patients with CAP. Based on clinical evidence, high-dose, short-course therapies may represent a significant advance in the management of CAP.

Pediatric HIV — bacterial pneumonia (S. pneumoniae; occasionally S. aureus, H. influenzae, P. aeruginosa) treatment includes the following regimens: First choice options are amoxicillin 90 mg/kg/dose orally divided every 8 or 12 hours (max 1 g/dose) for outpatient management; ampicillin 200–400 mg/kg/day divided every 6 hours (max 2 g/dose) (use higher dose if S. pneumoniae MIC ≥ 4 mcg/mL); or ceftriaxone 50–100 mg/kg body weight per dose once daily, or 25–50 mg/kg body weight per dose twice daily IV or IM (max 4 g/day). Alternatives are ceftazidime 200–300 mg/kg/day divided every 8 hours IV or IM (max 12 g/day), or cefepime 50 mg/kg/dose every 8 hours IV or IM (max 2 g/dose). Alternative treatment should be determined based on local antimicrobial susceptibility patterns or that of the bacterial isolate, if available. For children who are receiving combination ART, have mild or no immunosuppression, and have mild-to-moderate community-acquired pneumonia, oral therapy option would be amoxicillin 45 mg/kg/dose twice daily (maximum dose: 4 g per day). Add azithromycin for hospitalized patients to treat other common community-acquired pneumonia pathogens (M. pneumoniae, C. pneumoniae). Add clindamycin or vancomycin if methicillin-resistant S. aureus is suspected (base the choice on local susceptibility patterns). For patients with neutropenia, chronic lung disease other than asthma (e.g. LIP, bronchiectasis) or indwelling venous catheter, consider regimen that includes activity against P. aeruginosa (such as ceftazidime or cefepime instead of ceftriaxone). Consider PCP in patients with severe pneumonia or more advanced HIV disease. Evaluate for tuberculosis, cryptococcosis, and endemic fungi as epidemiology suggests.

### New guidelines for the management of adult community-acquired pneumonia [^f2e2362f]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Community-acquired pneumonia is a major cause of morbidity and mortality, and is the leading cause of death from an infectious disease. International societies have published and revised guidelines aiming to improve the management of adult community-acquired pneumonia, based on the best available evidence. The aim of this review is to compare the current guideline recommendations.

Recent Findings

Aspects of guidelines differ based on local factors including resources and antimicrobial factors, as well as the differences in interpretation of existing evidence.

Summary

The lack of robust evidence behind aspects of guideline recommendations as well as the lack of adherence to published guidelines both need to be addressed if the management of community-acquired pneumonia is to be improved.

### A multicenter, open-label, randomized comparison of levofloxacin and azithromycin plus ceftriaxone in hospitalized adults with moderate to severe community-acquired pneumonia [^3c7ae0b9]. Clinical Therapeutics (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Changing etiologic patterns and the growing problem of antimicrobial resistance, particularly an increase in macrolide-resistant pneumococcal bacteremia, are causing physicians to adopt new approaches to the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP).

Objective

The relative efficacy and tolerability of levofloxacin monotherapy and azithromycin and ceftriaxone combination therapy were assessed in hospitalized adults with moderate to severe CAP.

Methods

This Phase IV, multicenter, open-label, randomized trial compared 2 treatment regimens: (1) levofloxacin 500 mg PO or IV q24h, and (2) azithromycin 500 mg IV q24h for ≥ 2 days plus ceftriaxone 1 g IV q24h for 2 days, followed by an optional transition to azithromycin 500 mg PO q24h at the investigator's discretion. The total duration of therapy was to be a minimum of 10 days in both treatment groups. Ceftriaxone was included in the initial azithromycin regimen to ensure coverage against pneumococcal bacteremia.

Results

Of 236 patients in the intent-to-treat population, completion or withdrawal information was available for 110 patients in the levofloxacin group and 114 in the azithromycin group. Baseline demographic and disease characteristics were comparable between groups. At the end of treatment, the clinical success rate (cured + improved) in clinically evaluable patients was 94.1% in the levofloxacin group and 92.3% in the azithromycin group. The respective posttherapy microbiologic eradication rates were 89.5% and 92.3%. Levofloxacin was as well tolerated as azithromycin, with an incidence of drug-related adverse events (AEs) for all body systems of 5.3% and 9.3%, respectively. None of the drug-related AEs were considered serious.

Conclusions

In this study in hospitalized patients with moderate to severe CAP, levofloxacin monotherapy was at least as effective as a combination regimen of azithromycin and ceftriaxone in providing coverage against the current causative pathogens in CAP. In addition, levofloxacin was as well tolerated as the combination of azithromycin and ceftriaxone.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in hospitalized patients with HIV — non-severe disease — has a recommendation that remains to administer either a beta-lactam/macrolide combination therapy, or a single drug regimen of a respiratory fluoroquinolone (AI). Monotherapy with a macrolide is not recommended in the inpatient setting, and preferred agents are specified (ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, or ampicillin-sulbactam; azithromycin or clarithromycin; moxifloxacin or levofloxacin). If a patient has contraindications to a macrolide or a fluoroquinolone, then doxycycline should be given as an alternative (BIII) in addition to a beta-lactam, and IV penicillin is an acceptable option for treatment of pneumococcal disease in patients with HIV (BIII). In patients who are allergic to penicillin, an IV respiratory fluoroquinolone (moxifloxacin or levofloxacin [750 mg/day]) alone should be used (AI), and fluoroquinolone monotherapy should be used with caution in patients in whom TB is suspected but who are not being treated with concurrent standard four-drug TB therapy.

We examined the impact of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society/Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines that recommend ampicillin or amoxicillin for children hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia. Prescribing of ampicillin/amoxicillin increased following guideline publication, but remains low. Cephalosporin and macrolide prescribing decreased but remains common. Further studies exploring outcomes of and reasons for compliance with guidelines are warranted.

What to do with antibiotic therapy?

There is no RCT data to guide the therapeutic approach to a non-responding patient. Clinicians must therefore rely heavily on the art of medicine and clinical judgement. If review of the relevant clinical data suggests an alternative diagnosis or pathogen or antimicrobial resistance profile, modifications of antibiotic therapy may be needed and can be divided into verification of adequate dosing, escalation of therapy to cover MDR pathogens, or addition of agents from a different antimicrobial class to cover atypical or non-bacterial organisms.

Worsening bacterial infection due to inappropriate antibiotic coverage could occur if the offending organism was resistant to the initial antibiotic choice, if it was originally susceptible but there was emergence of resistance during therapy, or if the antibiotic chosen did not reach the lung parenchyma with adequate concentrations. Risk factors for resistant infections at baseline differ based on the type of organism, therefore assessment of individual epidemiologic and clinical risk factors is critical. For instance, ceftriaxone-resistant pneumococcus is uncommon in the United States (US) but more prevalent in Taiwan and South Korea; risk factors include extensive previous treatment with antibiotics for respiratory tract infections. Because high-doses of beta-lactams are used to treat CAP in the US, it is unlikely that the presence of ceftriaxone-resistance would lead to failure of treatment of pneumonia. On the other hand, the use of bactericidal vs bacteriostatic antibiotics is not a risk factor for non-response. This was borne out in a recent meta-analysis of 42 studies that found no difference in clinical cure rates between patients treated with bactericidal vs bacteriostatic agents.

There are no data from proper studies to answer whether it is necessary to include antibiotics that are active against atypical pneumonia agents as part of the empiric therapy of CAP. Until such data are available, clinical judgment and severity of the pneumonic illness are the best guides to empiric antimicrobial therapy.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in HIV — preferred empiric therapy: Empiric antibiotic therapy should be initiated promptly for patients presenting with clinical and radiographic evidence consistent with bacterial pneumonia, and the regimen should be modified as needed once microbiologic results are available (BIII). For empiric outpatient therapy, a PO beta-lactam plus a PO macrolide (azithromycin or clarithromycin) (AII) is suggested; preferred beta-lactams include high-dose amoxicillin or amoxicillin/clavulanate, with alternatives cefpodoxime or cefuroxime, or levofloxacin 750 mg PO once daily (AII), or moxifloxacin 400 mg PO once daily (AII), especially for patients with penicillin allergies. For hospitalized patients with non-severe CAP, an IV beta-lactam plus a macrolide (azithromycin or clarithromycin) (AI) is preferred using ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, or ampicillin-sulbactam; for penicillin allergies, levofloxacin 750 mg IV once daily (AII), or moxifloxacin, 400 mg IV once daily (AII) are options. For hospitalized patients with severe CAP, an IV beta-lactam plus IV azithromycin (AI), or an IV beta-lactam plus levofloxacin 750 mg IV once daily or moxifloxacin 400 mg IV once daily (AI) are suggested empiric therapy options.

Outpatient CAP with comorbidities — broader-spectrum regimens and fluoroquinolone considerations: Patients with comorbidities should receive broader-spectrum treatment, with regimens recommended that include a β-lactam or cephalosporin in combination with either a macrolide or doxycycline; these combinations should effectively treat macrolide- and doxycycline-resistant S. pneumoniae, β-lactamase–producing strains of H. influenzae, many enteric gram-negative bacilli, most methicillin-susceptible S. aureus, and M. pneumoniae and C. pneumoniae. Despite increasing reports of adverse events related to fluoroquinolone use, the panel believed that fluoroquinolone therapy was justified for adults with comorbidities and CAP managed in the outpatient setting. The guideline adopts the convention to recommend that patients with recent exposure to one antibiotic class receive treatment with a different class, and notes that both sets of treatment recommendations contain multiple antibiotic options without specifying a preference order, requiring a risk–benefit assessment that weighs local epidemiology and individual risk factors such as documented β-lactam or macrolide allergy, cardiac arrhythmia (macrolides), vascular disease (fluoroquinolones), and history of infection with Clostridium difficile.

### A cost-minimization analysis comparing azithromycin-based and levofloxacin-based protocols for the treatment of patients hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia: results from the CAP-IN trial [^58125940]. Chest (2005). Low credibility.

Background

A randomized trial was performed comparing azithromycin and levofloxacin for treating moderately to severely ill patients hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia. This is a cost-minimization analysis comparing those regimens.

Methods

The cost-minimization analysis compares 81 patients receiving sequential therapy with IV azithromycin plus IV ceftriaxone followed by oral azithromycin with 82 patients receiving IV levofloxacin followed by oral levofloxacin, all with complete economic data over approximately 30 days, including information about hospitalization, study medications, home care, postdischarge utilization, and lost productivity. Units of utilization were multiplied by unit prices in order to estimate cost per patient. These total costs were compared using a two-sample t test.

Results

Direct medical costs of the azithromycin group were 2,481 US dollars less than the corresponding costs in the levofloxacin group (p = 0.03; 95% confidence interval, 238 US dollars to 4,724 US dollars). Most of the cost difference (2,300 US dollars) is attributable to hospital days, with the majority of these days being spent on the general medicine wards. The precise magnitude of the cost advantage attributable to azithromycin, if any, depends on both the reduction in length of hospital stay and its associated daily cost.

Conclusions

Azithromycin was no more costly than levofloxacin, and perhaps less so. Cost is but one of many factors that should be considered by clinicians in decisions involving any individual patient.

### Optimal therapy for severe pneumococcal community-acquired pneumonia [^f3e9427d]. Intensive Care Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Streptococcus pneumoniae is responsible for two-thirds of ICU admissions due to community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and is the leading cause of CAP-related death. Early death is principally due to cardiovascular collapse, whereas late death is associated with hypoxemic respiratory failure. Outcome depends on interactions between non-modifiable factors of predisposition (age, comorbidities, host defences, genetic predisposition) or infection (toxins, virulence, bacterial burden) and modifiable factors (organ-failure support, surgical drainage for empyema, adjuvant therapies and antibiotics). Excess mortality has been reported when initial therapy is discordant, but more than 95% of isolates have minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) < 4 microg/ml. Therefore, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone and high doses of amoxicillin remain successful for non-meningeal infections. Recent studies suggest that initial combination therapy improves survival in the subset of bacteremic episodes with highest severity, conceivably due to the immunomodulatory effects of macrolides. Prospective, randomized clinical trials of pneumonia patients with a pneumonia severity index score above 90 are warranted to define optimal antibiotic regimens.

MRSA or Pseudomonas aeruginosa coverage and HCAP category — adults with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in the inpatient setting: we recommend abandoning use of the prior categorization of healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP) to guide selection of extended antibiotic coverage in adults with CAP (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence), and we recommend clinicians only cover empirically for MRSA or P. aeruginosa in adults with CAP if locally validated risk factors for either pathogen are present (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence); empiric treatment options for MRSA include vancomycin (15 mg/kg every 12 h, adjust based on levels) or linezolid (600 mg every 12 h), and for P. aeruginosa include piperacillin-tazobactam (4.5 g every 6 h), cefepime (2 g every 8 h), ceftazidime (2 g every 8 h), aztreonam (2 g every 8 h), meropenem (1 g every 8 h), or imipenem (500 mg every 6 h); if clinicians are currently covering empirically for MRSA or P. aeruginosa on the basis of published risk factors but do not have local etiologic data, we recommend continuing empiric coverage while obtaining culture data to justify continued treatment after the first few days of empiric treatment (strong recommendation, low quality of evidence).

### Ceftobiprole medocaril sodium (Zevtera) [^e896b3ed]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Trial Design

The efficacy of ZEVTERA in the treatment of adult patients with community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP) was demonstrated in a randomized, controlled, double-blind, multinational, multicenter study (Trial 3) (NCT00326287). 638 adults hospitalized with CABP and requiring IV antibacterial treatment for at least 3 days were included in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population, comparing ZEVTERA 667 mg (equivalent to 500 mg of ceftobiprole) IV every 8 hours to ceftriaxone (2 grams IV every 24 hours) with optional linezolid (600 mg IV every 12 hours) for the coverage of resistant gram-positive pathogens, including methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). Randomization was stratified by Pneumonia Outcomes Research Team (PORT) classification I to III versus IV to V, and by the need for adjunctive treatment with linezolid or matching placebo. The treatment duration was 5–14 days. No adjunctive macrolide therapy was allowed. A switch to oral cefuroxime (500 mg every 12 hours) was allowed after at least 72 hours of IV study treatment for patients who met stringent protocol-specified criteria for improvement and were candidates for hospital discharge.

The study enrolled adult patients hospitalized with CABP based on clinical signs and symptoms, fever and/or leukocytosis/leukopenia, and new radiographic evidence of pulmonary infiltrates. Patients with known bronchial obstruction, pulmonary malignancies, cystic fibrosis, lung abscess, pleural effusion as the primary source of infection, active tuberculosis, or pneumonia known or suspected to be caused by atypical bacteria, were excluded from study participation, as were patients with known or suspected extrapulmonary complications such as concomitant meningitis, endocarditis, septic arthritis, or osteomyelitis.

The ITT primary analysis population comprised all patients randomized. The clinically evaluable (CE) population comprised patients in the ITT population who received at least 48 hours of study medication and met protocol-defined criteria regarding clinical evaluability.

The protocol-specified primary efficacy analyses included clinical cure rates at TOC visit, 7 to 14 days after the end-of-treatment (EOT) in the co-primary ITT and CE populations. The ITT population comprised 638 patients (314 ZEVTERA, 324 ceftriaxone ± linezolid), in 103 centers in the USA, Asia, Europe, and Latin America. The CE population comprised 469 patients, and the microbiological ITT (mITT) population comprised 184 patients with at least one valid baseline pathogen.

### Approach to common bacterial infections: community-acquired pneumonia [^82ae4df5]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) occurs more often in early childhood than at almost any other age. Many microorganisms are associated with pneumonia, but individual pathogens are difficult to identify, which poses problems in antibiotic management. This article reviews the common as well as new, emerging pathogens, as well as the guidelines for management of pediatric CAP. Current guidelines for pediatric CAP continue to recommend the use of high-dose amoxicillin for bacterial CAP and azithromycin for suspected atypical CAP (usually caused by Mycoplasma pneumoniae) in children.

### Clinical efficacy of newer agents in short-duration therapy for community-acquired pneumonia [^2046e0a7]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Streptococcus pneumoniae, the most important respiratory tract pathogen implicated in community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), is becoming increasingly resistant in vitro to the beta -lactams and macrolides, and fluoroquinolone resistance has been detected. A growing body of evidence suggests that prolonged antimicrobial use may contribute directly and indirectly to increased antimicrobial resistance among common respiratory pathogens. Long-term exposure to antimicrobial agents, especially less-potent agents, directly increases selection pressure for resistance. Indirectly, poor patient compliance, multiple daily dosing, and the increased risk of adverse events further complicate the resistance issue and diminish the efficacy of long-term antimicrobial use. Controlled clinical trials addressing the appropriate duration of therapy for CAP are lacking. However, available data suggest that with appropriate antibiotic selection, based on appropriate spectrum, potency, and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic profile, lower respiratory tract infections in outpatients can be successfully treated in < 7 days rather than the 7–14 days currently recommended.

### Empiric antibiotic coverage of atypical pathogens for community acquired pneumonia in hospitalized adults [^6397bc31]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Community acquired pneumonia (CAP) is caused by various pathogens, traditionally divided to 'typical' and 'atypical' Initial antibiotic treatment of CAP is usually empirical, customarily covering both typical and atypical pathogens. To date, no sufficient evidence exists to support this broad coverage, while limiting coverage is bound to reduce toxicity, resistance and expense.

Objectives

Assess the efficacy and need of adding antibiotic coverage for atypical pathogens in hospitalized patients with CAP, in terms of mortality and successful treatment.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 1, 2005) which includes the Acute Respiratory Infection Group's specialized register; MEDLINE (January 1966 to January Week 2 2005); and EMBASE (January 1980 to January Week 2 2005).

Selection Criteria

Randomized trials of adult patients hospitalized due to CAP, comparing antibiotic regimens with atypical antibiotic coverage to a regimen without atypical antibiotic coverage.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently appraised the quality of each trial and extracted the data from included trials. Relative risks (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated, assuming an intention-to-treat (ITT) basis for the outcome measures.

Main Results

Twenty four trials were included, encompassing 5015 randomized patients. There was no difference in mortality between the atypical arm and the non-atypical arm (RR 1.13; 95% CI 0.82 to 1.54). The atypical arm showed an insignificant trend toward clinical success and a significant advantage to bacteriological eradication, which disappeared when evaluating methodologically high-quality studies alone. Clinical success for the atypical arm was significantly higher for Legionella pneumophilae (L. pneumophilae) and non-significantly lower for pneumococcal pneumonia. There was no significant difference between the groups in the frequency of (total) adverse events, or those requiring discontinuation of treatment. However, gastrointestinal events were more common in the non-atypical arm (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.99).

Authors' Conclusions

No benefit of survival or clinical efficacy was shown to empirical atypical coverage in hospitalized patients with CAP. This conclusion relates mostly to the comparison of quinolone monotherapy to non-atypical monotherapy. Further trials, comparing beta-lactam (BL) or cephalosporin therapy to BL or cephalosporin combined with a macrolide in this population, using mortality as its primary outcome, should be performed.

American Thoracic Society/Infectious Diseases Society of America community-acquired pneumonia guideline — scope and initial questions: This document provides evidence-based clinical practice guidelines on the management of adult patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), developed by a multidisciplinary panel that conducted pragmatic systematic reviews and applied Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation methodology for clinical recommendations. The panel addressed 16 specific areas spanning diagnostic testing, determination of site of care, selection of initial empiric antibiotic therapy, and subsequent management decisions, formulating recommendations and rationale on selected diagnostic and treatment strategies for adult CAP. Although some recommendations remain unchanged from the 2007 guideline, results from new therapeutic trials and epidemiological investigations led to revised recommendations for empiric treatment strategies and additional management decisions. The contents highlight early diagnostic questions for adults with CAP, including whether Gram stain and culture of lower respiratory secretions or blood cultures should be obtained at the time of diagnosis, and also list a third question beginning "Question 3: In Adults with CAP, Should Legionella and".

### Does empiric therapy for atypical pathogens improve outcomes for patients with CAP? [^de5dd938]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

The present controversy regarding the need to cover atypical pathogens in the empiric therapy of community-acquired pneumonia is related to several issues, including the relevance of terminology, imprecise diagnostic methods, and perceived contradictory results of published evidence. Studies evaluating the time to clinical recovery and the use of earlier endpoints for evaluation suggest that appropriate therapy provides a benefit if an atypical pathogen is a pathogen. Because recent surveillance studies suggest these pathogens are common and until there is the availability of accurate, cost-effective, and easily interpreted laboratory tests to provide the etiologic diagnosis at the time of point of care, empiric therapy of atypical pathogens is supported.

### Community-acquired pneumonia: the evolving challenge [^4e48abe2]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2001). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a common disorder that has been the focus of a major international research effort to define its epidemiology, etiology and management. The microbial etiology of CAP is complex and severity assessment is important in identifying at-risk populations as well as defining therapeutic strategies. Laboratory investigations rarely influence initial therapy, which remains empirical. Guidelines have been developed in many countries in response to the need to optimize management and outcomes. However, many of these guidelines have been based on expert opinion rather than robust evidence. New evidence-based guidelines have been developed that take into account disease severity, the local distribution of pathogens and their likely susceptibility to antimicrobials, and that include newer treatment options. Macrolide and fluoroquinolone antimicrobials feature heavily in these new treatment recommendations. Promising new therapies continue to emerge that may offer advantages over fluoroquinolones and macrolides, in particular with regard to the problem of resistance. Of these, the ketolides are of special interest. Telithromycin, the first ketolide antibacterial, has been evaluated in the treatment of > 700 patients with CAP. A once-daily oral dose of telithromycin 800 mg for 7–10 days produces clinical and bacteriological success rates > 90% and equivalent to standard comparator agents, whilst maintaining efficacy against resistant pathogens.

### Nonresponses and treatment failures with conventional empiric regimens in patients with community-acquired pneumonia [^158eee85]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Although most patients with suspected CAP respond to empiric therapy, a small number of patients do not respond in the expected fashion. Age and underlying comorbid conditions have a strong influence on the course of illness. Less common causes of treatment failures include overwhelming infection, antimicrobial resistance, and misdiagnosis. It is a common practice for empiric antimicrobial treatment of CAP to be initiated without microbiologic studies. Clinicians carefully should observe these patients for unusual or slow responses and should be ready to pursue a more extensive search for the cause of treatment failure.

### Bacterial superinfection pneumonia in patients mechanically ventilated for COVID-19 pneumonia [^3696f146]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Endpoints

We examined the following two primary endpoints: 1) the prevalence of bacterial superinfection within 48 hours of intubation and 2) the incidence rate of subsequent VAP over the entire duration of mechanical ventilation. Bacterial CAP, HAP, and VAP were defined using standard nomenclature. Bacterial CAP was defined as bacterial pneumonia (in addition to known SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia) suspected and diagnosed within the initial 48 hours of admission. Bacterial HAP was defined as a bacterial pneumonia newly suspected and diagnosed after 48 hours of hospitalization. Bacterial VAP was defined as a bacterial pneumonia newly suspected and diagnosed after 48 hours of endotracheal intubation. Secondary endpoints included the emergence of pathogens demonstrating resistance to antimicrobial therapies, clinical outcomes based on infection status, and the use of antibiotics.

For each day of mechanical ventilation, we measured the spectrum and number of antibiotics using a Narrow Antibiotic Treatment (NAT) score developed for CAP treatment studies. Briefly, standard CAP treatment of ceftriaxone and azithromycin was assigned a score of 0, monotherapy with either was assigned a score of −1, and no antibiotic therapy was assigned a score of −2; broader spectrum antibiotics were assigned progressively higher positive scores (see Table E2 and Figure E1 in the online supplement). A difficult-to-treat pathogen was defined by the need for a carbapenem to treat gram-negative pathogens rather than standard first-line β-lactam HAP antibiotics or vancomycin or linezolid for Staphylococcus aureus.

Inpatient Empiric Antimicrobial Therapy for Nonsevere CAP and No Risk Factors for Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus or Pseudomonas aeruginosa

The guidelines recommend combination therapy with a β-lactam and a macrolide for all patients who receive a non-FQ regimen. Although one randomized trial failed to demonstrate noninferiority of β-lactam monotherapy versus β-lactam plus macrolide combination therapy in attainment of clinical stability on hospital Day 7, a clinical benefit of combination therapy was seen in patients with confirmed atypical pathogens or patients with Pneumonia Severity Index category IV pneumonia. Another cluster randomized trial that was not discussed in the guidelines demonstrated noninferiority of β-lactam monotherapy versus β-lactam plus macrolide combination therapy in 90-day mortality, favoring β-lactam monotherapy in non-ICU patients. A subsequently published meta-analysis that included observational data and results from the above-mentioned randomized trials found a mortality benefit from combination therapy only for severe CAP. Because atypical pathogens account for < 5% of CAP in U.S. population studies and combination therapy may only benefit patients with severe CAP, routine atypical coverage may not be necessary in outpatients or inpatients with nonsevere CAP; therefore, β-lactam monotherapy is recommended in CAP guidelines in other countries.

### How important is methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus as a cause of community-acquired pneumonia and what is best antimicrobial therapy? [^c919fc8b]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

The emergence of methicillin-resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus has raised issues regarding the importance of methicillin-resistant S aureus (MRSA) in community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and its optimal treatment. Community-acquired MRSA (CA-MRSA) is an important cause of CAP because of the high mortality if not suspected early, and its occurrence in young patients with long life expectancy. Certain clinical features can increase the probability of CA-MRSA as a cause of CAP. The consistent trend toward better outcomes for documented MRSA pneumonia suggests that linezolid be considered the drug of choice for documented MRSA CAP, especially for CA-MRSA.

Management of NP includes administration of supplemental oxygen to relieve hypoxia, analgesics for reducing pleuritic pain and consequent improvement of ventilation, prolonged antibiotic therapy, and reduction of mass effects or intrathoracic pressure by draining gas and/or intrapleural fluid.

In a healthy and fully immunized child, the treatment option is antibiotics to cover gram-positive organisms, particularly pneumococci, S. aureus, and S. pyogenes, as with empyema. The first-line recommended treatment for children with pneumonia includes intravenous (IV) penicillin or ampicillin and is switched to beta-lactam anti-staphylococcal antibiotics, such as oxacillin or flucloxacillin, in those who are hospitalized due to severe but uncomplicated community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). In cases of suspicion of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), confirmed by culture, and conditions (e.g. local prevalence > 10%, ethnicity, recent personal or household history of skin infections), appropriate antibiotics should be used. Although, vancomycin penetration in the pulmonary parenchyma is poor, it has a 20% treatment failure rate in the case of MRSA pneumonia if given as monotherapy; hence, until MRSA is confirmed, a beta-lactam anti-staphylococcal antibiotic should be part of the management protocol. However, the addition of linezolid, clindamycin, or rifampicin, which are capable of inhibiting protein synthesis (including toxin production), in cases of infection with S. aureus or S. pyogenes infections, has superior results, but high-level evidence for this regimen is lacking. In cases of suspicion for mycoplasma pneumonia (MP), macrolides such as IV clarithromycin or azithromycin are added but do not replace the antibiotics that are active against pneumococci and S. aureus. More often, in children with NP, the microbiology result is negative, and the resistance of respiratory pathogens against macrolide is high. Finally, if the child is unimmunized against H. influenzae type b (Hib), immunocompromised, or the infection is suspected to be hospital-acquired, the best initial empiric antibiotic therapy includes extensive gram-negative coverage with the addition of a third or fourth generation cephalosporin. The desired course of treatment with antibiotics in NP ranges from 13 to 42 days, with an average duration of 21 days. Following the normalization of the body temperature, inflammatory markers, feeding tolerance, and respiratory distress, the IV antibiotics should be switched to oral antibiotics and followed for 10–14 consecutive days.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^042a3e58]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in adults and adolescents with HIV — empiric regimens and dosing: Empiric antibiotic therapy should be initiated promptly for patients with clinical and radiographic evidence consistent with bacterial pneumonia, and the regimen should be modified as needed once microbiologic results are available (BIII); providers must also consider the risk of opportunistic lung infections (e.g. PCP, TB), which may alter empiric therapy. Empiric outpatient therapy includes a PO beta-lactam plus a PO macrolide (azithromycin or clarithromycin) (AII), with preferred beta-lactams high-dose amoxicillin or amoxicillin/clavulanate; alternatives are cefpodoxime or cefuroxime, or levofloxacin 750 mg PO once daily (AII) or moxifloxacin 400 mg PO once daily (AII), especially for patients with penicillin allergies. For hospitalized patients with nonsevere CAP, an IV beta-lactam plus a macrolide (azithromycin or clarithromycin) (AI) is listed, with preferred beta-lactams ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, or ampicillin-sulbactam; options for penicillin-allergic patients are levofloxacin 750 mg IV once daily (AI) or moxifloxacin 400 mg IV once daily (AI). Alternative therapy options include a PO beta-lactam plus PO doxycycline (CIII), an IV beta-lactam plus doxycycline (CIII), and for penicillin-allergic patients with severe CAP, aztreonam IV plus levofloxacin 750 mg IV once daily or moxifloxacin 400 mg IV once daily (BIII).

Healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP) was defined as patients with pneumonia that fulfilled any one of the following criteria: (1) hospitalization for more than 48 h in the last 90 days; (2) residence in a long-term care facility; (3) home infusion therapy within 30 days; (4) chronic dialysis within 30 days; or, (5) home wound care during the 30 days preceding admission.

Antimicrobial therapy

Adequate antibiotic therapy was defined as treatment with at least one agent to which all recovered isolates were susceptible in vitro.

Guideline-concordant and guideline-discordant antibiotic therapy

Empirical therapy within the first 24 h of hospitalization was evaluated for concordance or discordance to the 2007 IDSA/ATS guidelines for CAP Patients were considered to have received guideline-concordant antibiotic therapy if they received initial treatment as outlined in Table 1, regardless of any additional antibiotic received. Patients with severe CAP were considered to have received guideline-concordant antibiotic therapy if they received initial treatment according to guidelines for patients with CAP in ICU. Patients who received all other antibiotic regimens were considered to have received guideline-discordant antibiotic therapy.

### Ceftaroline fosamil versus ceftriaxone for the treatment of Asian patients with community-acquired pneumonia: a randomised, controlled, double-blind, phase 3, non-inferiority with nested superiority trial [^b36ef63a]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2015). Medium credibility.

Background

Ceftriaxone with or without a macrolide antibiotic is a recommended treatment for patients with community-acquired pneumonia requiring hospital admission and intravenous antibiotic treatment. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of ceftaroline fosamil compared with ceftriaxone in the treatment of Asian patients admitted to hospital with community-acquired pneumonia.

Methods

In this international, randomised, controlled, double-blind, phase 3, non-inferiority with nested superiority trial, adult Asian patients with Pneumonia Outcomes Research Team (PORT) risk class III-IV acute community-acquired pneumonia were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive intravenous ceftaroline fosamil (600 mg every 12 h) or ceftriaxone (2 g every 24 h) for 5–7 days. Patients were randomly assigned via centralised telephone and web-based system; patients and treating clinicians were masked to treatment allocation. Investigators who did study assessments remained masked to treatment allocation until completion of the study. The primary endpoint was clinical cure at the test-of-cure visit (8–15 days after last dose of study drug) in the clinically evaluable population. Non-inferiority of ceftaroline fosamil was defined as a lower limit of the two-sided 95% CI for the difference in the proportion of patients clinically cured of -10% or higher; if non-inferiority was achieved, superiority was to be concluded if the lower limit of the 95% CI was greater than 0%. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01371838.

Findings

Between Dec 13, 2011, and April 26, 2013, 847 patients were enrolled at 64 centres in China, India, South Korea, Taiwan, and Vietnam, of whom 771 were randomly assigned and 764 received study treatment. In the clinically evaluable population (n = 498) 217 (84%) of 258 patients in the ceftaroline fosamil group and 178 (74%) of 240 patients in the ceftriaxone group were clinically cured at the test-of-cure visit (difference 9·9%, 95% CI 2·8–17·1). The superiority of ceftaroline fosamil was consistent across all preplanned patient subgroup analyses (split by age 65 years, age 75 years, sex, PORT risk class, and previous antibiotic use) apart from patients younger than 65 years. The frequency of adverse events was similar between treatment groups and the safety results for ceftaroline fosamil were consistent with the cephalosporin class and previous clinical trial data.

Interpretation

Ceftaroline fosamil 600 mg given every 12 h was superior to ceftriaxone 2 g given every 24 h for the treatment of Asian patients with PORT III-IV community-acquired pneumonia. These data suggest that ceftaroline fosamil should be regarded as an alternative to ceftriaxone in empirical treatment regimens for this patient population.

### Addition of macrolide antibiotics for hospital treatment of community-acquired pneumonia [^ed501482]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Antibiotics are the main treatment for bacterial community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). In the United Kingdom (UK), guidelines from the British Thoracic Society and National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommend amoxicillin for the empirical treatment of low- to moderate-severity pneumonia, and co-amoxiclav for high-severity pneumonia. For moderate- and high-severity pneumonia, these guidelines suggest combining macrolide antibiotics with amoxicillin or co-amoxiclav to provide coverage for atypical pathogens such as Mycoplasma. Similarly, European and Latin American guidelines also recommend the addition of macrolides to β-lactams as empirical antibiotic therapy in hospitalized patients with severe CAP, while United States (US) guidelines recommend including atypical cover (which can be with a β-lactam + macrolide or respiratory fluroquinolone monotherapy) for all patients hospitalized with CAP.

Macrolides have also been hypothesized to improve outcomes from pneumococcal pneumonia, even when an active β-lactam is given, by means other than their antimicrobial activity (eg, anti-inflammatory effects). However, macrolide use is associated with an increased risk of adverse cardiovascular events, adverse gastrointestinal events, and resistance against multiple antibiotics at both a population level and within individuals.

Existing population-based studies and clinical trials have yielded contradictory evidence.

Several retrospective and small prospective studies have suggested that dual therapy (β-lactam plus macrolide) is associated with lower mortality in patients with severe CAP. However, these findings have been challenged by other observational studies that reported no significant differences in outcomes, such as mortality and length of hospital stay, between monotherapy and combination therapy. Two meta-analyses of observational studies reported that macrolide use was associated with a significant reduction in mortality. In contrast, a noninferiority trial in non–intensive care unit (ICU) CAP patients found that monotherapy was noninferior to combination therapy in terms of 90-day mortality. Another noninferiority trial recruiting patients with moderately severe CAP reported delayed clinical stability with monotherapy but found no differences in mortality or length of stay. A recent randomized trial suggested that adding macrolides to β-lactam therapy improved clinical response and reduced the inflammatory burden, although mortality remained similar between groups.

Given these conflicting results, large observational studies may help by comparing treatment options in real-world representative populations. We therefore examined the effect of adjunctive macrolides on clinical outcomes in adults hospitalized for CAP receiving β-lactam therapy, using electronic healthcare records from a large UK teaching hospital group, extending the approach used in our recent analysis of the impact of β-lactam choice in CAP.

American Thoracic Society/Infectious Diseases Society of America 2019 community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) guideline — key changes versus 2007 — state that sputum culture is "Now recommended in patients with severe disease as well as in all inpatients empirically treated for MRSA or Pseudomonas aeruginosa", and blood culture is "Now recommended in patients with severe disease as well as in all inpatients empirically treated for MRSA or P. aeruginosa". Macrolide monotherapy carries a "Conditional recommendation for outpatients based on resistance levels". Use of procalcitonin is "Not recommended to determine need for initial antibacterial therapy", and corticosteroids are "Recommended not to use. May be considered in patients with refractory septic shock". The healthcare-associated pneumonia category has a directive to "Recommend abandoning this categorization. Emphasis on local epidemiology and validated risk factors to determine need for MRSA or P. aeruginosa coverage. Increased emphasis on deescalation of treatment if cultures are negative". For standard empiric therapy for severe CAP, "Both accepted but stronger evidence in favor of β-lactam/macrolide combination", and follow-up chest imaging is "Recommended not to obtain. Patients may be eligible for lung cancer screening, which should be performed as clinically indicated".

### The role of new therapies for severe community-acquired pneumonia [^b8c7536c]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is associated with significant morbidity and mortality and is the most common cause of death from infectious diseases. CAP patients requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission carry the highest mortality rates. This paper aims to review the current literature regarding epidemiology, risk factors, severity criteria and reasons for admitting the hospitalized patient to the ICU, and the empiric and specific antibiotic therapeutic regimens employed.

Recent Findings

Multiple sets of clinical practice guidelines have been published in the past few years addressing the treatment of CAP. The guidelines all agree that CAP patients admitted to the hospital represent a major concern, and appropriate empiric therapy should be instituted to improve clinical outcomes.

Summary

The cost, morbidity and mortality of CAP patients requiring ICU admission remain unacceptably high. These are heterogeneous groups of patients, so it is important to use risk-stratification based on clinical parameters and prediction tools. Appropriate antibiotic therapy is an important component in the management of both groups of patients. In particular, it is essential to administer an appropriate antimicrobial agent from the initiation of therapy, so that the risks of treatment failure and the morbidity of CAP may be minimized.

### Guidelines for empiric antimicrobial prescribing in community-acquired pneumonia [^cbe0b5b9]. Chest (2004). Low credibility.

Empiric antimicrobial prescribing for community-acquired pneumonia remains a challenge, despite the availability of treatment guidelines. A number of key differences exist between North American and European guidelines, mainly in the outpatient setting. The North American approach is to use initial antimicrobial therapy, which provides coverage for Streptococcus pneumoniae plus atypical pathogens. Europeans tend to focus on providing pneumococcal coverage with less emphasis on covering for an atypical pathogen. Ambulatory patients without comorbidity are more likely to receive macrolide therapy in North America, whereas in Europe these patients would probably receive a beta-lactam agent. Major issues that are fundamental to this difference include the importance of providing therapy for atypical pathogens and the clinical significance of macrolide-resistant S pneumoniae. Prospective data are required to evaluate which of these two approaches offers clinical superiority.

### Ceftriaxone versus ampicillin for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia. A propensity matched cohort study [^1ce767e4]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Ceftriaxone is recommended as first-line antibiotic treatment (with the addition of macrolide) for hospitalised adults with community acquired pneumonia (CAP). Narrower-spectrum β-lactam as ampicillin, may be associated with comparable clinical outcomes, with less emergence of resistant pathogens or Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI). We aimed to examine whether ampicillin and ceftriaxone (with the addition of macrolides for both arms) are comparable for the treatment of hospitalized adults due to CAP.

Methods

This was a single center, observational cohort study. We included adult patients who were hospitalized in internal medicine wards due to CAP and were treated with either ceftriaxone or ampicillin with the addition of macrolide. A propensity-score model was used. The primary outcome was 30-day all-cause mortality. A multivariable logistic regression analysis and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was performed. We performed subgroup analyses for the main outcome based on CURB-65 score and age.

Results

A total of 1586 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria. There was no difference in 30-day mortality rate in the total cohort (28/233 vs. 208/1353 in ampicillin and ceftriaxone arm, respectively; p = 0.184). In the propensity matched cohort (197 in ampicillin and 394 in ceftriaxone arm), there was no significant difference in 30-day all-cause mortality between treatment groups in multivariable analysis of the main model (OR 0.67, 95% CI, 0.37–1.2; p = 0.189) and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis (p = 0.108). Thirty-day mortality rate was (19/197 vs. 57/394, in ampicillin and ceftriaxone arms, respectively; p = 0.108) Patients who were treated with ampicillin experienced significantly lower rates of CDI (0/197, 0% vs. 8/394, 2%; p = 0.044).

Discussion

Ampicillin was associated with comparable clinical outcomes in comparison to ceftriaxone for patients who were hospitalized due to CAP. Ampicillin was associated with significantly lower rate of CDI. Results need to be confirmed by more robust study designs.

### Review of treatment guidelines for community-acquired pneumonia [^24babb34]. The American Journal of Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a costly disease that is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The growing prevalence of this disease has resulted in various advances in diagnosis and treatment. The most common pathogens of CAP include Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and atypical pathogens; however, the underlying pathogen often is unknown. Treatment of CAP has evolved because of changing etiologic patterns and increasing antimicrobial resistance among common respiratory pathogens. Among the groups that have established treatment guidelines for CAP are the American Thoracic Society (ATS), the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). These guidelines establish risk factors associated with drug resistance or infection with specific pathogens. In addition, each guideline provides unique recommendations that are similar in some ways, yet different in others. By understanding the various risk factors for drug resistance and the treatment options endorsed by these guidelines, physicians can treat patients with the most appropriate antimicrobial available.

Target Trial Emulation Study Diagram

CAP indicates community-acquired pneumonia; COPD, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; and CT, computed tomography.

Target Trial Hypothetical Treatment Regimen

Our hypothetical treatment regimen randomized patients to receive a CAP antibiotic regimen or no antibiotics on day 1. We defined a CAP antibiotic regimen as receiving 1 or more of the antibiotic agents listed in the Infectious Diseases Society of America CAP Clinical Pathway: ampicillin/sulbactam, ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, azithromycin, clarithromycin, doxycycline, levofloxacin, and/or moxifloxacin. We defined the exposure for our emulated target trial, ie, the hypothetical treatment regimen, according to billing for CAP antibiotic agents initiated in the emergency department or day 1 of admission. We used an intention-to-treat approach, and treatment group assignment remained the same during analysis regardless of changes in antibiotic therapy, ie, discontinuation or intensification. For example, a patient receiving a single dose of a CAP antibiotic in the emergency department and no further antibiotics inpatient would be analyzed in the exposed group. To assess treatment after day 1, we calculated the percentage of patients who received CAP antibiotic treatment on day 2 or later for both groups and calculated the median days of therapy (DOT; number of unique days of treatment per antibiotic agent).

Outcomes

Our primary outcome was a composite measure of deterioration (defined as transfer to ICU, intermediate care; step down level of care between ICU and general ward], initiation of vasopressors, high-flow oxygen [heated and humidified oxygen delivered at higher rates than standard nasal cannula], noninvasive ventilation, or invasive mechanical ventilation) and in-hospital mortality occurring on day 2 or later. We assessed deterioration via administrative billing codes and ICD-10 procedure codes (eTable 3 in Supplement 2). Antibiotic adverse events during the index admission, including kidney failure, not POA, allergic reaction, or C difficile infection, were evaluated as safety outcomes and identified using ICD-10 codes. All-cause readmission at 30 days (to the same institution) and hospital length of stay were included as secondary outcomes.

### Managing community-acquired pneumonia: a European perspective [^2fa91ae5]. Respiratory Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a common disease and a frequent cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. It puts an enormous burden on medical and economic resources, particularly if hospitalization is required. Initial antibacterial therapy for CAP is usually empirical, as culture and antibacterial sensitivity test results are rarely available at initial diagnosis. Any agent selected for empirical therapy should have good activity against the pathogens commonly associated with CAP, a favorable tolerability profile, and be administered in a simple dosage regimen for good compliance. Streptococcus pneumoniae remains the most common causative pathogen, although the incidence of this organism varies widely. Streptococcus pneumoniae strains with decreased susceptibility to penicillin have become increasingly prevalent over the past 30 years and are now a serious problem worldwide. In addition, an increase in the prevalence of pneumococci resistant to macrolides has been observed in Europe over recent years. Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia pneumoniae are among the most common atypical pathogens isolated from patients with CAP. Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus and Moraxella catarrhalis are less commonly identified as causative organisms. The emergence and spread of resistance to commonly used antibiotics has challenged the management of CAP. Multiple sets of CAP guidelines have been published to address the continued changes in this complex disease.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in adults — microbiologic testing stance and sampling strategy: Microbiological testing has yet to deliver fast, accurate, and affordable testing with proven benefit, with exceptions including rapid testing for MRSA and influenza; this guideline significantly increases the proportion of patients in whom we recommend routinely obtaining respiratory tract samples for microbiologic studies, a change largely aimed at correcting overuse of anti-MRSA and antipseudomonal therapy since the introduction of the HCAP classification (which we recommend abandoning) rather than based on high-quality evidence, and clinicians must validate any empiric approach based on local spectrum and frequency of resistant pathogens.

### The elusive concept of appropriate antibiotic for septic patients when a pathogen is not detected by standard culture methods [^996011d7]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Certain bacterial pathogens inherently elude identification via traditional culture-based methods: a textbook example is Legionella pneumophila, which causes community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) or systemic disease often fulfilling criteria for sepsis. Diagnosis typically relies on urinary antigen detection or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in respiratory specimens. Following the inclusion/exclusion criteria of Chang et al. a case of severe Legionnaires' disease wherein extrapulmonary manifestations predominate could be considered in the category of "appropriate treatment" if an empirical guideline-directed medical therapy for suspected central nervous system infection is initiated in cases of fever, confusion, and disorientation, thereby implying a regimen with vancomycin plus ceftriaxone or cefotaxime and possibly ampicillin.

This underscores the need to incorporate molecular and rapid diagnostics into sepsis management. Additionally, in the antibiotic stewardship era, narrower-spectrum therapies targeting isolated pathogens should be prioritized. The study would have benefited from describing the spectrum of antibiotic therapies used in the two groups.

Second, the authors acknowledge the limited generalizability of their findings beyond bacterial sepsis. However, this does not rule out the possibility that a fraction of culture-negative cases had non-bacterial infectious etiology: viruses, fungi, parasites. Current definitions of sepsis or septic shock according to the Sepsis-3 consensus are not pathogen-sensitive. This limitation underscores the necessity of pathogen-agnostic diagnostic strategies to ensure that non-bacterial etiologies are accurately identified and treated. Considering viral sepsis, likely the most common non-bacterial scenario, the risks of empirical antibiotic overuse have been debated for years. The prime example is represented by CAP: guidelines recommend a beta-lactam plus a macrolide for severe cases, with added coverage for Pseudomonas or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus if needed. Therefore, while the association between a third-generation cephalosporin plus azithromycin is guideline-concordant, it would retrospectively appear inappropriate if a viral pathogen were identified via multiplex PCR. Such scenarios likely occurred in the study, raising concerns about definition of appropriateness and antibiotic overuse.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

14.1 Community-Acquired Pneumonia

In a controlled trial of community-acquired pneumonia performed in the U.S., azithromycin (500 mg as a single daily dose by the intravenous route for 2 to 5 days, followed by 500 mg/day by the oral route to complete 7 to 10 days therapy) was compared to cefuroxime (2,250 mg/day in three divided doses by the intravenous route for 2 to 5 days followed by 1,000 mg/day in two divided doses by the oral route to complete 7 to 10 days therapy), with or without erythromycin. For the 291 patients who were evaluable for clinical efficacy, the clinical outcome rates, i.e., cure, improved, and success (cure + improved) among the 277 patients seen at 10 to 14 days post-therapy were as follows:

In a separate, uncontrolled clinical and microbiological trial performed in the U.S., 94 patients with community-acquired pneumonia who received azithromycin in the same regimen were evaluable for clinical efficacy. The clinical outcome rates, i.e., cure, improved, and success (cure + improved) among the 84 patients seen at 10 to 14 days post-therapy were as follows:

Microbiological determinations in both trials were made at the pre-treatment visit and, where applicable, were reassessed at later visits.

### Clinical trial design for mild-to-moderate community-acquired pneumonia – an industry perspective [^b7cb0b4b]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

The use of noninferiority clinical trials is problematic unless one can establish the benefit of the active control versus no treatment. In community-acquired pneumonia, there are no placebo-controlled clinical trials establishing the benefit of antibiotic treatment, because the observed benefit of sulfapyridine and, subsequently, penicillin was established before the advent of randomized clinical studies. Historical data and observational cohort studies have established the marked decrease in mortality resulting from antimicrobial therapy; however, mortality is not a suitable end point for contemporary clinical trials for mild-to-moderate community-acquired pneumonia that is treated with oral antimicrobial drugs in ambulatory patients. There are historical clinical data that describe the timing of spontaneous recovery in patients with documented pneumonia caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae. In addition, there is one contemporary clinical trial that demonstrated superiority in clinical response of levofloxacin versus a cephalosporin regimen of ceftriaxone and/or cefuroxime for treatment of mild-to-moderate community-acquired pneumonia. Using either the historical data or the superiority study of levofloxacin, one can justify a noninferiority margin of 10% for the per-protocol population and 15% for the microbiologically evaluable population for future noninferiority clinical trials for mild-to-moderate community-acquired pneumonia.

### Viewing the community-acquired pneumonia guidelines through an antibiotic stewardship lens [^e907035a]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Antibiotic Recommendations and Influenza

The guidelines recommend antibiotics for both inpatients and outpatients with clinical and radiographic evidence of CAP who test positive for influenza, with a consideration to stop antibiotics within 72 hours if no bacterial pathogen is found and the patient achieves early clinical stability. This recommendation is likely to lead to increases in unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions for patients with influenza. In the outpatient setting, sputum cultures and chest X-rays are not routinely obtained; hence, providers may not know when to stop antibiotics. Additionally, the rate of bacterial complications of influenza is low (∼ < 2.5%). Antibiotics may not be necessary for most outpatients with influenza or those who are hospitalized but are not severely ill.

Guidelines regarding the use of antibiotics must balance treatment recommendations with AS considerations and specifically note when regimens are supported by clinical trials but may be suboptimal because of side effects or costs. Many providers regard the guidelines as strict recommendations rather than as a starting point for clinical decision-making. Thus, discussions about areas in which the available evidence is inconclusive should include the viewpoint of antibiotic stewards at the patient and population levels. We strongly encourage active engagement from AS on future guidelines to facilitate discussions about judicious prescribing of antibiotics and to inform practical interpretation and implementation of those guidelines.
