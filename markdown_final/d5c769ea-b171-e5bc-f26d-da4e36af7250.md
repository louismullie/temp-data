## Question

A male neonate, who was born at 36 weeks' gestation 2 hours ago in the labor and delivery unit of the hospital, now shows signs of respiratory difficulty. The mother, an 18-year-old primigravid woman, smoked one pack of cigarettes daily throughout her pregnancy. She received prenatal care during most of the pregnancy. One episode of chlamydial cervicitis was detected during the last trimester and treated with azithromycin. The neonate was born via cesarean delivery due to fetal heart rate decelerations. The amniotic fluid was stained with light particulate meconium. Apgar scores were 9 and 9 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. The patient is 50 cm (20 in; 50th percentile) long and weighs 3005 g (6 lb 10 oz; 50th percentile); head circumference is 35 cm (14 in; 50th percentile). The infant's vital signs now are temperature 36.6°C (97.8°F), pulse 150/min, and respirations 70/min. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 95%. Physical examination discloses mild subcostal and intercostal retractions. Chest x-ray shows prominent pulmonary vascular markings and fluid in the intralobar fissures. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

Answer Choices:
A. Group B streptococcal sepsis
B. Meconium aspiration syndrome
C. Respiratory distress syndrome
D. Transient tachypnea of newborn

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which diagnosis is most likely for a 36-week neonate with respiratory distress, given the clinical and radiographic findings. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the key clinical features and how they map to common neonatal respiratory entities. Then, I should verify the radiographic pattern and what it implies for fluid dynamics and lung inflation. Next, I will weigh each competing diagnosis against the evidence base and guideline-based criteria. Finally, I will synthesize the most likely diagnosis and note any caveats or next steps in management.

> Let me first confirm the salient clinical features: a late preterm infant at 36 weeks, born by cesarean section, with tachypnea to 70/min, mild retractions, and room air oxygen saturation around 95%, appearing within the first 2 hours of life. The chest X-ray shows prominent pulmonary vascular markings and fluid in the intralobar fissures, with otherwise relatively preserved lung volumes, and the infant is otherwise well-appearing with good tone and Apgar scores of 9/9, which together steer me toward a benign, self-limited process rather than severe parenchymal disease or systemic illness [^d3220c26] [^3c6c3f1c].

> Now, I will examine the radiographic pattern carefully. Prominent perihilar vascular markings and fluid in the fissures, with normal or hyperinflated lungs, are classic for transient tachypnea of the newborn, reflecting delayed clearance of fetal lung fluid and transient pulmonary vascular engorgement. In contrast, RDS typically shows hypoinflation with a reticulogranular pattern and air bronchograms, and MAS tends to show coarse, patchy opacities with hyperinflation and segmental atelectasis, so this film fits TTN best [^d3220c26] [^cdc41d54].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should review the differential and test each option against the data. For group B streptococcal sepsis, the infant lacks risk factors such as maternal GBS colonization without adequate intrapartum antibiotics, chorioamnionitis, or prolonged rupture of membranes, and the absence of fever, lethargy, or hypothermia makes early-onset sepsis less likely; moreover, the radiograph is not consistent with pneumonia, which would more often show focal consolidation or interstitial changes rather than perihilar vascular prominence and fissural fluid [^f04c771e] [^613bafea].

> For meconium aspiration syndrome, I initially thought the presence of meconium-stained fluid might suffice, but wait, let me verify the clinical trajectory. MAS typically presents with significant respiratory distress at or within hours of birth, often with cyanosis, coarse crackles, and marked hyperinflation on CXR with patchy opacities; this infant has only mild retractions, good oxygenation, and a radiograph showing perihilar vascular prominence and fissural fluid rather than the coarse, asymmetric opacities of MAS, so MAS is unlikely here despite the meconium staining [^fe06ae47] [^74509d05].

> For respiratory distress syndrome, I need to check gestational age and lung maturity. RDS is primarily a disease of prematurity due to surfactant deficiency; at 36 weeks, the risk is substantially lower than at 34 weeks, and the radiographic hallmark is hypoinflation with a ground-glass appearance and air bronchograms, which we do not see here; the preserved lung volumes and perihilar vascular prominence argue against RDS in this case [^d3220c26] [^0ef9606e].

> Transient tachypnea of the newborn aligns with the full clinical picture: onset within the first hours of life, tachypnea with mild retractions, good oxygenation, and the characteristic CXR findings of perihilar vascular prominence and fissural fluid, especially in the context of cesarean delivery and late preterm gestation. Cesarean birth and early gestational age are well-established risk factors for delayed lung fluid clearance, and TTN is typically self-limited with supportive care [^d3220c26] [^3c6c3f1c] [^9ebae295].

> But wait, what if the maternal chlamydia history is relevant? I should double-check that. Neonatal chlamydial pneumonia typically presents after 1–2 weeks of life with afebrile tachypnea, staccato cough, and diffuse interstitial disease; this infant's immediate postnatal presentation and radiographic pattern do not fit chlamydial pneumonia, and maternal treatment with azithromycin further reduces the likelihood of vertical transmission in this scenario [^0766c246].

> Next, I should review management implications to ensure the diagnosis is actionable. TTN is managed supportively with observation, supplemental oxygen as needed, and consideration of noninvasive support if distress worsens; fluid restriction has been explored but evidence is limited and low certainty, so routine fluid restriction is not firmly recommended outside of trials, and antibiotics are not indicated unless there are signs of infection or evolving risk factors for sepsis [^1952d268] [^0727c8b6].

> In summary, integrating the timing of onset, clinical stability, oxygenation, and the characteristic chest radiograph, the most likely diagnosis is transient tachypnea of the newborn. The absence of red flags for sepsis, the mismatch with MAS and RDS radiographic patterns, and the presence of TTN risk factors collectively support this conclusion [^d3220c26] [^3c6c3f1c].

The most likely diagnosis is **transient tachypnea of the newborn (TTN)** [^d3220c26], given the clinical picture of mild respiratory distress within 2 hours of birth, good oxygenation, and chest X-ray findings of prominent pulmonary vascular markings with fluid in the intralobar fissures [^d66aeec8]. TTN is common in late preterm infants delivered by cesarean section [^3c6c3f1c] and typically resolves within 24–72 hours with supportive care [^d3220c26]. Meconium aspiration syndrome is less likely because the infant is vigorous with good Apgar scores and no coarse opacities or air leaks on X-ray [^fe06ae47]. Respiratory distress syndrome is unlikely at 36 weeks without surfactant deficiency features [^0ef9606e]. Group B streptococcal sepsis is not supported by the absence of maternal risk factors or clinical signs of infection [^f04c771e].

---

## Clinical features supporting TTN

- **Gestational age**: 36 weeks (late preterm), which increases the risk of TTN due to delayed lung fluid clearance [^3c6c3f1c].
- **Mode of delivery**: Cesarean section, especially without labor, is a major risk factor for TTN [^9ebae295].
- **Clinical presentation**: Tachypnea, mild retractions, and good oxygenation (SpO2 95% on room air) are classic for TTN [^d3220c26].
- **Chest X-ray**: Prominent pulmonary vascular markings and fluid in the intralobar fissures are characteristic of TTN, reflecting retained fetal lung fluid [^d3220c26].

## Differential diagnosis analysis

| **Condition** | **Reasons for and against** |
|-|-|
| Transient tachypnea of the newborn (TTN) | - Strongly supported by clinical course, risk factors, and radiographic findings [^d3220c26] [^3c6c3f1c] <br/> - Self-limited course expected [^d3220c26] |
| Meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS) | - Meconium-stained fluid is present, but infant is vigorous with good Apgar scores [^9b04a102] <br/> - No coarse opacities, hyperinflation, or air leaks on X-ray [^fe06ae47] <br/> - Less likely than TTN |
| Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) | - Unlikely at 36 weeks without surfactant deficiency features [^0ef9606e] <br/> - X-ray does not show diffuse reticulonodular pattern or air bronchograms [^cdc41d54] |
| Group B streptococcal sepsis | - No maternal GBS colonization or inadequate intrapartum prophylaxis reported [^f04c771e] <br/> - No fever, lethargy, or other signs of infection <br/> - Unlikely |

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

The most likely diagnosis is **transient tachypnea of the newborn (TTN)** [^d3220c26]. The infant should receive supportive care with monitoring of respiratory status, oxygen as needed, and cautious fluid management [^1952d268]. Antibiotics are not indicated unless there is clinical suspicion of infection, and the prognosis is excellent with resolution expected within 24–72 hours [^d3220c26].

### The neonatal chest X-ray [^e4a05edf]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

The chest X-ray is the most valuable imaging modality in the assessment of the neonate with respiratory distress. Whilst many of the radiological appearances are relatively non-specific, integration of the clinical features with the X-ray appearances will help the clinician arrive at the correct diagnosis in most cases. In a minority of infants, particularly those with a congenital malformation of the chest or airways other imaging modalities may be required. This paper will describe the radiological appearances of the most important causes of neonatal respiratory distress and highlight those situations where more complex investigations are necessary.

Case presentation

We report a male baby born in a peripheral setting at 36 weeks of gestation to a 36 year old primiparous mother whose pregnancy was complicated by breech presentation and premature rupture of membranes at 34 weeks of gestation. Delivery was by emergency caesarean section with maternal general anaesthetic for fetal distress and cord prolapse. Apgar scores were 4, 5, 5, and 8 at one, five, ten and fifteen minutes respectively. He required mask ventilation at birth for primary apnoea and was intubated at seven minutes of postnatal age for persistent apnoea. At 30 min of life he was extubated to CPAP of 5 cmH 2 O and FiO 2 was weaned from 100 to 44%. On these settings he had a tachypnoea of 90 breaths per minute with mildly increased respiratory effort and a pre-ductal oxygen saturation of ≥ 97%. A capillary blood gas excluded respiratory or metabolic acidosis. Empiric antibiotics benzylpenicillin and gentamicin were commenced to cover the risk of sepsis due to the prolonged rupture of membranes. Chest x-rays at 2 and 4 h of life showed crescent shaped homogeneous opacities in both upper lung fields (Fig. 1). The Neonatal and Paediatric Emergency Transport Service (NETS) was consulted. Initial paediatric radiological advice via telemedicine was that this appearance could represent bilateral pleural effusions. Accordingly the PEEP was increased to 8cmH 2 O; lateral decubitus x-ray (not shown) was uninformative. Due to the uncertainty regarding the cause of the respiratory distress the baby was transferred to the local neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) by NETS at 10 h of postnatal life.

### Infected congenital pericardial cyst with mass effect on adjacent structures, a rare presentation in an infant in LMIC setting: a case report and review of literature [^dc4008c2]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

The patient is a 2 month old male infant, delivered at gestational age 39 + 5 weeks via vaginal delivery with a birth weight of 3.2 kg. The baby was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) due to respiratory distress, cyanosis, and poor feeding. Prenatal care was uncomplicated, and no congenital anomalies were detected on routine prenatal ultrasound. However mother had history of treatment for malaria during third trimester of her pregnancy.

The symptoms progressively worsened, prompting transfer to the PICU for further evaluation and management. There was no history of maternal infections or complications during pregnancy.

The baby was treated for early onset neonatal sepsis at the age of 7 days. He stayed in hospital for 10 days and readmitted with the above complaint.

Physical examination

On examination, the newborn was in severe respiratory distress, with tachypnea, cyanosis, and subcostal and intercostal retractions. Vital signs included a heart rate of 196 bpm weak, respiratory rate of 70 breaths/min, oxygen saturation of 75% on room air, and blood pressure of 55/30mmHg. Cardiovascular examination revealed tachycardia with muffled heart sounds, and respiratory examination showed decreased breath sounds on the right side. The abdomen was soft and non-tender with positive signs of fluid collection, and there was mild peripheral cyanosis pedal and pretibial edema.

### Respiratory distress of the term newborn infant [^ad6828b4]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Respiratory distress is recognised as any signs of breathing difficulties in neonates. In the early neonatal period respiratory distress is common, occurring in up to 7% of newborn infants, resulting in significant numbers of term-born infants being admitted to neonatal units. Many risk factors are involved; the increasing number of term infants delivered by elective caesarean section has also increased the incidence. Additionally the risk decreases with each advancing week of gestation. At 37 weeks, the chances are three times greater than at 39–40 weeks gestation. Multiple conditions can present with features of respiratory distress. Common causes in term newborn infants include transient tachypnoea of the newborn, respiratory distress syndrome, pneumonia, meconium aspiration syndrome, persistent pulmonary hypertension of the neonate and pneumothorax. Early recognition of respiratory distress and initiation of appropriate treatment is important to ensure optimal outcomes. This review will discuss these common causes of respiratory distress in term-born infants.

Case presentation

A 2550 g term female newborn admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) due to nasal flaring, tachypnea, and mild subcostal retraction. She born at 38 weeks of gestation and had a normal Apgar score in the first and fifth minutes. She born by cesarean section to a 21-year-old primigravida woman. In the absence of a history of previous illnesses, the mother had a history of new-onset moderate COVID-19 infection from 10-days before delivery, which led to her hospitalization. She had fever, cough, and reduced oxygen percentage to 90% at this period. Nevertheless, her disease was managed with oxygen and supportive care without antiviral therapeutic agents. On physical examination, the neonate had mild respiratory distress and the heart rate, respiratory rate, and blood pressure were 137/min, 62/min, and 70/50 mmHg, respectively. Oxygen saturation was 94% on oxygen, and the core temperature was 37 °C. Sepsis screening including blood culture, chest X-Ray, and all related lab tests (Table 1) was performed. The chest X-Ray was normal with no evidence of over or under aeration, prominent perihilar interstitial markings, opacification of the lung parenchyma, air-bronchogram, and pleural effusion. In addition, she evaluated for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR, using the current pishtazteb kits, according to the manufacturer's protocol, with a positive result. Empirical antibiotics (Ampicillin and Amikacins) started to treat possible early sepsis, and intravenous fluid of dextrose 10% in the water began as well.

### Sudden respiratory and circulatory collapse after cesarean section: amniotic fluid embolism or other reasons?-a case report [^6778b485]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Sudden respiratory and circulatory collapse after cesarean section is a clinical condition that may lead to poor maternal outcome. Because a number of clinical events in pregnancy may be responsible for cardiopulmonary collapse, sometimes, it is difficult to make a timely exact diagnosis. Importantly, establishment of appropriate supportive treatment is required. We present a healthy parturient suffering from unexplained cardiopulmonary collapse after an uneventful cesarean section and briefly discuss the more common reasons and the management for the clinical settings.

### Can neonatal lung ultrasound monitor fluid clearance and predict the need of respiratory support? [^cc460617]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

Key messages

- At birth, lung fluid content can be assessed non-invasively by ultrasound.

- Over the first 36 hours, pulmonary adaptation can be monitored with serial ultrasound scans.

- Lung ultrasound permits the early and reliable identification of those newborns who fail to adapt and show signs and symptoms of respiratory distress.

- Health care givers working in a low technology setting can use lung ultrasound for an early screening of neonates in need of respiratory support.

### Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in children: a systematic review of imaging findings [^889cec65]. Pediatric Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

It is worth noting that although our inclusion criteria were not set to review infected pregnant women, there was one case in this review of an infected newborn, diagnosed at 36 h of age from a COVID-19-positive mother. The authors proposed the possibility for vertical transmission as a route of infection; however, several subsequent articles reviewing outcomes of infected pregnant women have now suggested this to be unlikely. A recently published rapid review of coronavirus in pregnancy found that of the 32 infected women identified in the literature, there was 1 stillbirth (34 weeks of gestation) and 15/32 (47%) pre-term deliveries. In the 15/32 (47%) neonates who were tested for COVID-19, all were negative. The latest guidance from the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists has therefore recommended against routine separation of affected mothers and their babies and has not found any evidence to suggest intrauterine fetal infection or teratogenic effects from the novel coronavirus. Clinicians should thus remain alert to alternative, more common diagnoses in newborns presenting with respiratory symptoms (e.g. respiratory distress syndrome, aspiration, pneumonia from alternative organisms), even if the mother is COVID-19 positive.

### A rare cause of air-leak syndrome in a premature newborn: a case report [^c9d1abd2]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A 27-week four days old preterm male infant was born from a dichorionic diamniotic twin pregnancy with low birth weight(1135 gr). His prenatal examinations were completed regularly without reported complications. In the 27th week of pregnancy, the mother experienced premature membrane rupture, contractions, and bleeding. She was treated with antenatal steroids and cesarean delivery was planned due to an arrested birth. During birth, the neonate was hypotonic and apneic, requiring intubation one minute after birth due to respiratory failure with an uncuffed endotracheal tube. His APGAR scores were 4,6 and 7 in the 1st, 5th, and 10th seconds, respectively. He was transferred to the newborn intensive care unit(NICU) for further management. After a diagnosis of respiratory distress syndrome was made, treatment with endotracheal poractant alfa 200 mg/kg, parenteral ampicillin-gentamicin, and caffeine citrate was initiated. His ventilation settings were arranged to assist control and volume guaranteed mode with maximum inspiring pressure of 20 cm/H²O. His cranial ultrasound showed no abnormalities.

On hospital day 3, he was extubated to nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation but required reintubation for recurrent respiratory failure. His antibiotics were escalated to vancomycin-meropenem due to clinical deterioration.

During hospital day 5, the baby had worsening acute hypoxic respiratory failure. A chest x-ray revealed mediastinal pneumothorax (Fig. 1 A), with a follow-up x-ray one hour later showing accelerated pneumothorax on the left side and mediastinal shift to the right.(Fig. 1 B) To treat the pneumothorax, a thorax tube was placed through the left 5th intercostal space. Repeat x-rays showed an expanded lung on the left side and air bronchograms on the right(Fig. 1 C). Ten hours later, he had persistent acidosis and hypoxia, with another x-ray displaying a repeat pneumothorax on the left side(Fig. 1 D). The thorax tube was set to continuous suction, resulting in a reduction of pneumothorax on subsequent imaging.

### Effect of needle aspiration of pneumothorax on subsequent chest drain insertion in newborns: a randomized clinical trial [^2bc95e4a]. JAMA Pediatrics (2018). Medium credibility.

Importance

Treatment options for a symptomatic pneumothorax in newborns include needle aspiration (NA) and chest drain (CD) insertion. There is little consensus as to the preferred treatment, reflecting a lack of evidence from clinical trials.

Objective

To investigate whether treating pneumothoraces diagnosed on chest radiography (CR) in newborns receiving respiratory support with NA results in fewer infants having CDs inserted within 6 hours of diagnosis.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This randomized clinical trial was conducted from October 7, 2013, to December 21, 2016. The setting was 5 tertiary European neonatal intensive care units. Infants receiving respiratory support (endotracheal ventilation, continuous positive airway pressure, or supplemental oxygen > 40%) who had a pneumothorax on CR that clinicians deemed needed treatment were eligible for inclusion.

Interventions

Infants were randomly assigned (1:1) to drainage using NA or CD insertion, stratified by center and gestation at birth (< 32 vs ≥ 32 weeks). Caregivers were not masked to group assignment. For NA, a needle was inserted between the ribs to aspirate air and was removed once air was no longer aspirated. A CD was inserted if clinicians deemed that the response was inadequate. For CD insertion, a drain was inserted between the ribs and was left in situ.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was whether a CD was inserted on the side of the pneumothorax within 6 hours of diagnosis.

Results

A total of 76 infants were randomly assigned, and 6 (4 assigned to NA and 2 to CD) were excluded because they met exclusion criteria at enrollment. Of the 70 remaining infants, 33 (16 male [48%]) were assigned to NA and 37 (22 male [59%]) to CD insertion. Their median (interquartile range [IQR]) gestational age was 31 (27–38) vs 31 (27–35) weeks, and their median (IQR) birth weight was 1385 (1110–3365) vs 1690 (1060–2025) g, respectively. Fewer infants assigned to NA had a CD inserted within 6 hours (55% [18 of 33] vs 100% [37 of 37]; relative risk, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.40–0.75) and during hospitalization (70% [23 of 33] vs 100% [37 of 37]; relative risk, 0.70, 95% CI, 0.56–0.87).

Conclusions and Relevance

Needle aspiration reduced the rate of CD insertion in symptomatic newborns with pneumothorax on CR. It should be used as the initial method of draining radiologically confirmed pneumothorax in symptomatic infants.

### A case-control study on the effects of incomplete, one, and more than one dexamethasone course on acute respiratory problems in preterm neonates born between 28and 36 weeks of gestation [^8bdf7b15]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Details relating to the following were collected for each subgroup: APGAR scores < 7, positive pressure ventilator (PPV) of newborns, neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission, respiratory support of newborns, RDS, transient tachypnoea of the newborn (TTNB), apnoea, IVH, NEC, early onset neonatal sepsis and pneumonia. Maternal complications during the postpartum period and the length of hospital stay were also analysed. The final diagnosis of acute respiratory problem was made before the newborn was discharged from the hospital.

Definition of acute respiratory problems

"RDS" is defined as infants breathing more than 60 times per minute or having nasal flaring, expiratory grunting, or chest wall retractions, and receiving oxygenation for over 2 hours postpartum and hypoxemia which defined by a PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio ≤ 200 mmHg, and no evidence of left atrial hypertension or a pulmonary capillary pressure < 18 mmHg (if measured) to rule out cardiogenic edema.
"Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is defined as very preterm infants with chest x-ray presented of persistent lung parenchyma disease and preterm infants born after 35 6 weeks of gestation requiring oxygen or respiratory support to maintain SpO2 in the 90–95% range for at least 3 days. BPD does not include infants requiring ventilator due to central hypoventilation or airway disease.
Apnoea of prematurity is defined as respiratory pauses > 20 seconds or pauses < 20 seconds that are associated with bradycardia (< 100 beats/minute), central cyanosis, and/or oxygen saturation < 85% in neonates born at < 37 weeks gestation and with no underlying disorders causing apnoea.
Transient tachypnoea of the newborn is defined as infants with tachypnoea, retractions, grunting, and nasal flaring. Diagnosis is suspected when there is respiratory distress shortly after birth and is confirmed by chest x-ray. Recovery usually occurs within 24 hours.
Persistent tavhypnoea of the newborn is defined as infants with crackles, retractions, digital clubbing, failure to thrive, or respiratory failure; hypoxemia and diffuse radiological abnormalities present at diagnosis with a minimum duration of 4 weeks.

### Can neonatal lung ultrasound monitor fluid clearance and predict the need of respiratory support? [^9f5ef0c5]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

Discussion

This study shows that in the term and late preterm infant the early lung ultrasound profile can be classified in distinct patterns correlated to the lung fluid content. We document an evolution to the least hyperechogenic profile that is consistent with a clinically stable baby.

We found no previous approach using serial ultrasound scans to examine the extra-uterine respiratory adaptation in this neonatal population. Most other studies were focused on the preterm baby lung. In an unmasked investigation of 32 preterm infants, Copetti et al. described a specific sign of TTN comparing a single sonographic scan with the corresponding chest X-ray. Using the same approach, they also studied the ultrasound appearance of surfactant deficiency in a group of 40 infants with a mean gestational age of 27 weeks compared to 15 significantly larger and more mature controls (mean gestational age: 30 weeks). In the very preterm population, respiratory distress syndrome is associated with a sonographic white lung image that remains unmodified after surfactant replacement.

Studying less immature neonates, we focused our attention on the clinical outcomes in our series and the practical implications for the clinical neonatologist regardless of nosologic classifications. When compared with neonates at 39 to 40 weeks of gestation, the risk of respiratory failure almost triples at 37 weeks and increases more than tenfold at 34 weeks. Similarly, there is a significant increase in the risk of developing symptomatic TTN (adjusted odds ratio 6.1 at 36 and 14.7 at 34 weeks, respectively) or hyaline membrane disease (adjusted odds ratio 9.1 at 36 and 40.1 at 34 weeks, respectively).

As the regional organization of deliveries is often based on a 'hub and spoke' model, the timely identification of those infants in need of moderate to advanced respiratory support is crucial. Our results can help in this task. Likewise, an early type 3 profile (identical to the previously described normal lung image) was always confirmed at 12 hours and never associated with RD; this is also of clinical significance to those clinicians operating in birth centers where additional support equipment is not readily available.

We acknowledge some limitations of the present study. First, although an early allocation in the Type 1 group was effective in predicting the need for respiratory support, it did not discriminate between a milder and a more severe condition requiring mechanical ventilation. Second, the neonatologists acquiring the scans could not avoid observing the infant. This, however, was not critical in classifying the images, as assessed by the full agreement with the pediatric radiologist who was masked to the clinical conditions of the neonates.

Transient tachypnoea of the newborn

Transient tachypnoea of the newborn (TTN) is temporary respiratory distress seen in a term infant, due to retention of amniotic fluid in the lungs. It is the commonest cause of respiratory distress in term infants, with an estimated incidence of 4–6 cases per 1000 term births, and is generally benign and self-limiting. Clearance of fetal lung fluids normally begins before birth and continues through delivery promoted by catecholamines and other delivery-released hormones. Typical risk factors for TTN are caesarean delivery, maternal diabetes and obesity. In TTN, tachypnoea develops right after birth and up to 2 h after delivery and usually resolves within 72 h. Characteristics CR findings of TTN are normal or hyperinflated lung, perihilar interstitial opacities, blurred pulmonary vessels, and small pleural effusions, as shown in Table 2. TTN and RDS can appear similar radiologically, but TTN typically shows normal or hyperinflated lungs, whereas RDS presents with hypoinflation. Moreover, TTN occurs in term infants, while RDS is a disease of prematurity.

### Respiratory distress in the newborn [^7d7c7581]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

The most common etiology of neonatal respiratory distress is transient tachypnea of the newborn; this is triggered by excessive lung fluid, and symptoms usually resolve spontaneously. Respiratory distress syndrome can occur in premature infants as a result of surfactant deficiency and underdeveloped lung anatomy. Intervention with oxygenation, ventilation, and surfactant replacement is often necessary. Prenatal administration of corticosteroids between 24 and 34 weeks' gestation reduces the risk of respiratory distress syndrome of the newborn when the risk of preterm delivery is high. Meconium aspiration syndrome is thought to occur in utero as a result of fetal distress by hypoxia. The incidence is not reduced by use of amnio-infusion before delivery nor by suctioning of the infant during delivery. Treatment options are resuscitation, oxygenation, surfactant replacement, and ventilation. Other etiologies of respiratory distress include pneumonia, sepsis, pneumothorax, persistent pulmonary hypertension, and congenital malformations; treatment is disease specific. Initial evaluation for persistent or severe respiratory distress may include complete blood count with differential, chest radiography, and pulse oximetry.

Case presentation

An 11-year-old girl (UPN1) was referred for evaluation for matched sibling bone marrow transplantation (BMT) for treatment of MDS. She was the youngest of three children born to unrelated parents. The first male born to her parents was small for gestational age, weighing 1.87 kg at term. He had severe chest deformity (babygram shown in Figure 1) and died of respiratory distress at four hours of age. A diagnosis of probable ATD was made although no genetic testing could be performed, as causative genes were unknown at that time. The second was a well, unaffected male (who subsequently became the bone marrow donor for UPN1).

Figure 1
Babygram of the affected male sibling with severe respiratory distress. There is mild platyspondyly and generalised shortening of ribs and long bones. The metaphyses of the long bones are slightly irregular and there is some metaphyseal sclerosis.

UPN1 was born at 40 + 6 weeks gestation by a normal vaginal delivery. Her Apgar scores were 6 at one minute and 8 at 5 minutes and she required suction and oxygen by mask. Her birth weight was 2.59 kg, length 47 cm and head circumference 33 cm (all approximately on the 3 rd percentile). From 12 to 36 hours of postnatal life she developed tachypnoea, reaching a maximum of 120 breaths per minute. There was no cyanosis. On examination she had an obvious narrow chest, poor chest expansion, hepatomegaly of 2 cm and significant tachypnoea but no other obvious abnormalities. Chest auscultation was clear and cardiac examination was normal. A chest radiograph (not available) showed a narrow chest with no evidence of cardiac disease and the lung fields were consistent with transient tachypnoea of the neonate. UPN1 was admitted to the neonatal unit and was discharged 48-hour later with mild tachypnoea only. A geneticist had reviewed her and a diagnosis of probable ATD was reached. At this time her haemoglobin and platelet counts were normal and her total white cell count was 5.2 x 10 9 /l (no differential performed). Shortly afterwards her respiratory symptoms resolved completely.

### Newborn respiratory distress [^0727c8b6]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Newborn respiratory distress presents a diagnostic and management challenge. Newborns with respiratory distress commonly exhibit tachypnea with a respiratory rate of more than 60 respirations per minute. They may present with grunting, retractions, nasal flaring, and cyanosis. Common causes include transient tachypnea of the newborn, respiratory distress syndrome, meconium aspiration syndrome, pneumonia, sepsis, pneumothorax, persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn, and delayed transition. Congenital heart defects, airway malformations, and inborn errors of metabolism are less common etiologies. Clinicians should be familiar with updated neonatal resuscitation guidelines. Initial evaluation includes a detailed history and physical examination. The clinician should monitor vital signs and measure oxygen saturation with pulse oximetry, and blood gas measurement may be considered. Chest radiography is helpful in the diagnosis. Blood cultures, serial complete blood counts, and C-reactive protein measurement are useful for the evaluation of sepsis. Most neonates with respiratory distress can be treated with respiratory support and noninvasive methods. Oxygen can be provided via bag/mask, nasal cannula, oxygen hood, and nasal continuous positive airway pressure. Ventilator support may be used in more severe cases. Surfactant is increasingly used for respiratory distress syndrome. Using the INSURE technique, the newborn is intubated, given surfactant, and quickly extubated to nasal continuous positive airway pressure. Newborns should be screened for critical congenital heart defects via pulse oximetry after 24 hours but before hospital discharge. Neonatology consultation is recommended if the illness exceeds the clinician's expertise and comfort level or when the diagnosis is unclear in a critically ill newborn.

### Amniotic fluid embolism: diagnosis and management [^42e2d7b9]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Medium credibility.

Amniotic fluid embolism conclusions — Amniotic fluid embolism is a rare but often lethal condition, and maternal and perinatal mortalities appear to have decreased during the last decades likely because of improvements in the delivery of critical care, recognition of atypical or milder cases with no cardiorespiratory collapse, and the likely inclusion of patients with conditions other than amniotic fluid embolism. The diagnosis remains clinical and is often one of exclusion because no single specific diagnostic test is currently available, and treatment is mainly supportive involving delivery of the fetus when indicated, respiratory support (usually in the form of endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation), and hemodynamic support with the judicious use of fluids, vasopressors, inotropes, and pulmonary vasodilators; rapid initiation of treatment, aided by a high index of clinical suspicion, is essential. The recurrence rate of amniotic fluid embolism is unknown but appears to be low, much of the published literature is of poor quality and likely includes a significant number of patients with other conditions, and uniform diagnostic criteria for research publications are badly needed.

### Sail sign in neonatal pneumomediastinum: a case report [^051b340b]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Respiratory distress in the neonate is a frequent clinical scenario. Common causes include transient tachypnoea of the newborn, respiratory distress syndrome, pneumothorax, meconium aspiration syndrome and pneumonia. Pneumomediastinum is uncommon in both infants and children. In the neonate, pneumomediastinum may be asymptomatic but may also cause significant respiratory distress. We present a case of pneumomediastinum in a neonate in whom the initial chest x-rays (CXRs) were difficult to interpret.

### Fetal poisoning after maternal paraquat ingestion during third trimester of pregnancy: case report and literature review [^b908e171]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2007). Low credibility.

Introduction

Paraquat remains one of the common substances involved in intentional ingestions in Thailand. However, data on outcomes of paraquat ingestion during pregnancy is rarely available and the management is controversial.

Case Report

A 17-year-old female in 36 weeks of gestation attempted suicide by ingesting 1/2 a glass of Gramozonetrade mark (paraquat 27.6% w/v) 5 hours prior to arrival to the hospital. Gastric aspiration and lavage was performed and she was given 50 g of activated charcoal and 150 g of Fuller's Earth suspension. A male infant, weighing 2,390 g with an Apgar score of 71 1010, was delivered via emergency caesarean section 7 hours after ingestion. Due to presence of paraquat in the gastric lavage fluid, the mother was placed on dexamethasone/cyclophosphamide therapy. She developed mild renal insufficiency 63 hours after the ingestion. The infant developed tachypnea immediately after birth that self-resolved. The infant developed tachypnea again on day 6 of life. A chest x-ray revealed right lower lobe infiltration that progressed to diffuse interstitial pattern; subsequent chest x-rays showed evidence of fibrosis. Both mother and infant survived and the infant was discharged and sent home with oxygen 0.5 LPM. Upon follow up at 10 months of age, he still had evidence of chronic lung disease clinically and on chest x-ray.

Conclusion

Paraquat ingestion during the third trimester of pregnancy usually carries a very poor prognosis. Review of reported literature suggests that this case report represents only the second survival of mother and child.

1 Introduction

Neonatal respiratory distress is a common presentation in preterm infants, often attributed to complications of prematurity. However, when symptoms recur after apparent improvement or deviate from the expected clinical course, a broader differential must be considered. This case highlights a diagnostic and management challenge in a preterm infant who developed progressive respiratory insufficiency despite appropriate supportive care. Through a multidisciplinary investigation, an unexpected etiology was uncovered, prompting both medical and surgical interventions. This case report was reviewed by the institutional Health Research Ethics Board (REB) and was exempt from review.

Family 5

The proband is a 5-week-old male boy of Mexican ancestry born to parents who are third cousins (Fig. 1E). Pregnancy was complicated by pre-eclampsia and delivery was via c-section at 36 weeks of gestational age. The proband presented with sudden onset poor oral intake, respiratory difficulty, and lethargy. In the emergency room exam was notable for mottled appearance, sunken fontanelle, subcostal retractions, and lack of response. The initial blood gas showed a pH 6.8, CO 2 35, bicarbonate of 6 and lactate 14.9. Other laboratory abnormalities included transaminitis and coagulopathy (INR 4.7). Patient was intubated and chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly. Echocardiogram showed moderate left ventricular dilation with severely depressed left ventricular function (EF 14%) and moderate right ventricle depressed function (Fig. 2E–H). Patient was started on epinephrine and milrinone drips and furosemide for diuresis with improvement of perfusion and lactate to 1.4. Newborn screening, plasma acylcarnitine profile, and serum amino acids were normal. Genome study revealed a novel homozygous variant in LDB3 NM_007078.2:c.1219_1222del; NP_009009.1:p.(Val407ThrfsTer84). Parents were both heterozygous for the LDB3 variant with no history of cardiac disease. WES did not identify any additional variants of interest in Family 1. According to ACMG guidelines the variant was assigned as a Variant of Uncertain Significance (c.1219_1222del p.(Val407Thrfs*84): PM2; PM3_P; PP3: VUS). The proband is in the cardiac intensive care unit tolerating transition to oral heart failure medications (Captopril, Aldactone, Digoxin, Propranolol) and monitoring weight gain.

Objective

Lung disease is a common indication for neonates to require medical attention, and neonatal chest radiographs are among the most common studies interpreted by pediatric radiologists. Radiographic features of many neonatal lung disorders overlap, and it may be difficult to differentiate among conditions.

Conclusion

This review presents an up-to-date practical approach to the radiologic diagnosis of neonatal lung disorders, with a focus on pattern recognition and consideration of clinical history, patient age, and symptoms.

Neonatal symptoms

The most common neonatal symptoms were respiratory problems reported as respiratory distress, shortness of breath, respiratory difficulty, dyspnoea and breathing problems. Respiratory distress was the most common symptom reported in 14 neonates but the test for SARS-CoV-2 was positive in only 4 neonates and negative in 8. Pneumonia was seen in five neonates who were positive for SARS-CoV-2 and four neonates who were negative. Although usually respiratory symptoms are seen more in preterm babies due to pulmonary immaturity, in a single case report there were no neonatal complications in a SARS-CoV-2 positive mother who delivered a preterm baby at 29 weeks 5 days by emergency CS for maternal indications.

Diffuse bilateral granular and hazy opacities in chest radiograph and thickened lungs on X-ray were found in two neonates but the neonatal test for SARS-CoV-2 was negative in both of them. In another SARS-CoV-2 positive, newborn chest X-ray was consistent with pulmonary infection, 53 hours after birth. In another study, neonatal symptoms are extensively described. The most common first clinical symptom in the neonates of SARS-CoV-2 positive women was shortness of breath (n = 6), followed by gastrointestinal symptoms like feeding intolerance, bloating, refusing milk and gastric bleeding (n = 4). Other symptoms included fever, rapid heart rate and vomiting. Chest radiographic abnormalities included infections (n = 4), neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (n = 2) and pneumothorax (n = 1). Another preterm baby suffered from frequent oxygenation fluctuations and thrombocytopenia and was cured 15 days later. It was reported in yet another study that most of the complications in neonates were a result of prematurity (often iatrogenic) rather than SARS-CoV-2 infection. Other presentations in SARS-CoV-2 positive neonates included fever, cyanosis, lethargy, irritability, poor feeding, axial hypertonia, opisthotonus and feeding difficulties.

APGAR score

In our review, a total of nine studies have reported a low APGAR score among babies born to SARS-CoV-2 positive mothers. Seven of the neonates were very preterm or preterm and were SARS-CoV-2 negative. The APGAR score in these is likely to be due to pulmonary immaturity. Two other babies were term deliveries and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. However, another study reported low APGAR scores of 0–3 in 2 babies of COVID-19 positive mothers and 15 babies in COVID-19 negative mothers, indicating no statistically significant difference.

### The management of respiratory distress in the moderately preterm newborn infant [^752da1d7]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2011). Low credibility.

Respiratory distress in a moderately preterm baby often presents diagnostic and management challenges to the attending paediatrician. Many of these babies will require little or no intervention, but it is known that early intervention in babies with acute respiratory distress often prevents further complications. Most current research evidence relates to extremely preterm newborns, yet moderately preterm infants are numerically far more common. This article explores the differential diagnosis of respiratory distress in this population and presents an evidence based approach to treatment.

### Congenital emphysematous lung disease associated with a novel filamin A mutation. case report and literature review [^b72225e6]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A 32 day old male infant was referred to our department, from another hospital, with acute respiratory distress syndrome and suspected congenital pulmonary malformation. The baby (fourth child of nonconsanguineous caucasian parents) was born by vaginal delivery at 37 weeks' gestation, with a weight of 3140 g. The first month of life was unremarkable. The family had no history of genetic or metabolic diseases or congenital disorders.

At admission, the physical examination confirmed respiratory distress, general hypotonia due to respiratory failure and fatigue, bilateral inguinal hernia and deformities of the lower limbs (pes tortus congenitalis and hip dysplasia).

A chest X-ray (Fig. 1) and computed tomography (CT) scan (Fig. 2, Panels a, b) showed severe hyperinflation of the apical segment of the left lung and mediastinal shift to the right. A presumptive diagnosis of congenital lobar emphysema (CLE), including the lower lobe was made. After the stabilization of the subject's respiratory conditions (non invasive respiratory support, fluid and electrolyte management, broad spectrum antibiotics, bronchodilatator), considering the inclusion of the superior lobe and the upper part of the lower lobe we decided to proceed with observation.

Fig. 1
Chest X-ray at admission shows left pulmonary areas of hyperinflation (see arrows)

Fig. 2
CT thorax at admission (Panels a, b) and two months later (Panels c, d). The arrows indicate the hyperinflation area. Panels a, c: axial position; Panel b, d: sagittal position

Two months later, the child's condition deteriorated with worsening in respiratory distress; the child was unable to maintain saturation even with oxygen support. CT-angiography (Fig. 2, Panels c, d) was ordered and revealed a severe lobar emphysema of the anterior to the apicoposterior segment of the left upper lobe, with displacement of mediastinal structures to the right and compression of the right structures. A subsegmental atelectasis and areas of air trapping in the apicoposterior segment of the left lower lobe were also noted. Angiography showed peripheral pulmonary vascular attenuation and central pulmonary artery enlargement.

### The mystery of persistent pulmonary hypertension: an idiopathic infantile arterial calcification [^de48622c]. BMC Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Idiopathic infantile arterial calcification (IIAC) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder, characterized by wide spread calcifications in arterial walls, leading to vaso-occlusive ischaemia of multiple organs. Mortality is high, and there is no definitive treatment.

Case Presentation

A male neonate, 36+5 weeks gestation, 2.81 kg, was admitted to NICU for respiratory distress. At one hour of age, he was noted to be pale, hypoperfused, with weak pulses, a hyperdynamic precordium and a grade IV/VI pansystolic murmur. The rest of his examination was normal. A chest X-ray showed massive cardiomegaly and pulmonary oedema. An echocardiogram (ECHO) indicated moderate persistent pulmonary hypertension (PPHN) of unclear etiology. A diagnosis of Idiopathic infantile arterial calcification was made and a trial of Editronate therapy was given without success.

Conclusion

IIAC is a rare disorder, it should be considered whenever a neonate presents with unexplainable cardiac failure, PPHN, echogenic vessels on X-ray/ultrasound and, or concentric hypertrophic ventricles on ECHO. Serial antenatal ultrasound findings of echogenic cardiac foci should raise the suspicion of IIAC. Further studies to determine the long term effects of Editronate on vascular calcifications, disease outcome, and other treatment options are needed.

### Incidence and management of neonatal pneumothorax in a 10-hospital regional perinatal network in Switzerland: a retrospective observational study [^97ef6885]. American Journal of Perinatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Neonatal pneumothorax (PTX) is a life-threatening condition that occurs in 0.05 to 2% of all newbornsand up to 9% in very preterm infants. It is defined as a collection of air within the pleural space, due to rupture of over-distended alveoli. PTXs are classified as spontaneous (primary or secondary) or iatrogenic (caused by positive airway pressure or a surgical procedure). A primary spontaneous PTX occurs in the absence of any obvious cause, whereas a secondary spontaneous PTX is associated with an underlying lung disease, such as transient tachypnea of the newborn (TTN), respiratory distress syndrome, or meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS).

Numerous risk factors for developing PTX have been described including prematurity, very low birth weight (VLB; < 1,500 g), male gender, cesarean section, meconium-stained amniotic fluid (MSAF), underlying pulmonary disease, invasive and noninvasive respiratory support.

Several approaches in the management of neonatal PTX exist, namely, conservative treatment, chest tube (CT) drainage, and needle aspiration (NA), while other techniques, such as nitrogen (N 2) washout, have been abandoned.NA or needle thoracentesis is performed with an over-needle catheter or a butterfly needle inserted between the second and third ribs in the mid-clavicular line that evacuates air and is immediately removed once there is no more air to be aspirated.CT drainage implies the insertion of a tube (Charrière size 8–12) between the fourth and fifth ribs in the anterior axillary line to allow drainage of air and left in situ. So far, few recommendations have been established. For management of primary spontaneous PTX in adults, NA is the treatment of choice, as it is considered as effective and safe as CT drainage, and it results in fewer hospital admissions and shorter hospital stay. In neonatology, treatment depends on the experience and habits of the medical staff in charge of the patient. The choice of treatment may have an impact on the number of chest X-rays, the hospital stay duration, and possible complications.

### Respiratory distress in the newborn [^613bafea]. Pediatrics in Review (2014). Low credibility.

Respiratory distress presents as tachypnea, nasal flaring, retractions, and grunting and may progress to respiratory failure if not readily recognized and managed. Causes of respiratory distress vary and may not lie within the lung. A thorough history, physical examination, and radiographic and laboratory findings will aid in the differential diagnosis. Common causes include transient tachypnea of the newborn, neonatal pneumonia, respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), and meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS). Strong evidence reveals an inverse relationship between gestational age and respiratory morbidity. (1)(2)(9)(25)(26) Expert opinion recommends careful consideration about elective delivery without labor at less than 39 weeks' gestation. Extensive evidence, including randomized control trials, cohort studies, and expert opinion, supports maternal group B streptococcus screening, intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis, and appropriate followup of high-risk newborns according to guidelines established by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. (4)(29)(31)(32)(34) Following these best-practice strategies is effective in preventing neonatal pneumonia and its complications. (31)(32)(34). On the basis of strong evidence, including randomized control trials and Cochrane Reviews, administration of antenatal corticosteroids (5) and postnatal surfactant (6) decrease respiratory morbidity associated with RDS. Trends in perinatal management strategies to prevent MAS have changed. There is strong evidence that amnioinfusion, (49) oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal suctioning at the perineum, (45) or intubation and endotracheal suctioning of vigorous infants (46)(47) do not decrease MAS or its complications. Some research and expert opinion supports endotracheal suctioning of nonvigorous meconium-stained infants (8) and induction of labor at 41 weeks' gestation (7) to prevent MAS.

Meconium aspiration syndrome

Meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS) manifests as respiratory distress in infants who aspirate meconium-stained amniotic fluid, a sterile, black-green faecal material typically produced by fetuses after 34 weeks of gestation. MAS is rarer than RDS and TTN, with a reported incidence of 0.1–0.4% of births. Risk factors include delivery after 40 weeks gestational age, vaginal breech or caesarean delivery, maternal fever, and intraamniotic inflammation or infection. Pathophysiology involves airway obstruction by meconium plugs, inflammation, and infection, resulting in severe respiratory distress (Fig. 4). Clinical signs of MAS include evidence of perinatal asphyxia, fetal growth restriction or postmaturity. Respiratory distress is usually evident at birth or within a few hours. CR findings of MAS are hyperinflated lungs, coarse irregular bilateral lung opacities with segmental atelectasis and pneumonitis (Table 2). Imaging can help to differentiate MAS from other causes of neonatal respiratory distress, particularly pneumonia, whereas in cases of bilateral, coarse interstitial opacities, differentiation between MAS and neonatal pneumonia is impossible and neonates receive empirical antibiotic treatment. Moreover, pneumonia is associated with risk factors, such as maternal infection, premature rupture of membranes, or prolonged labour, with symptoms emerging within hours to days after birth, differing from the immediate presentation seen in MAS. Pneumothorax may occur in up to 10–20% of cases. Severe cases may necessitate extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, with increased risks of bleeding and stroke. Cross-sectional imaging is generally unnecessary, unless unresponsive to standard therapy, to rule out alternative causes of severe respiratory distress.

Fig. 4
Pathophysiology of meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS): Prolonged hypoxia stimulates fetal breathing and gasping, leading to inhalation of amniotic fluid and increased peristalsis with anal sphincter relaxation. This allows meconium to pass into the amniotic fluid, which can be aspirated during fetal gasping or initial breaths. Aspirated meconium causes airway obstruction, resulting in areas of atelectasis and/or hyperinflation distally. It also triggers inflammatory pneumonitis with epithelial damage and reduces surfactant activity and synthesis, further promoting atelectasis and consolidation. Decreased alveolar ventilation and ventilation-perfusion mismatch lead to hypoxaemia, causing respiratory distress and increasing infection risk. Persistent pulmonary hypertension is an associated complication of MAS

Early-term delivery after documented fetal lung maturity — retrospective cohort evaluation of a composite of respiratory and nonrespiratory complications — showed decreasing incidence with advancing gestational age. In 459 neonates delivered at 36 0/7 to 38 6/7 weeks after documented fetal lung maturity, the composite outcome decreased with increasing gestational age (P for trend < .001); 9.2% (CI = 5.9–14.1%) at 36 weeks of gestation, 3.2% (CI = 1.5–6.8%) at 37 weeks of gestation, 5.2% (CI = 2.0–12.6%) at 38 weeks of gestation, and 2.5% (CI = 2.2–2.8%) at 39–40 weeks of gestation. Additionally, analysis from the Eunice Kennedy Shriver NICHD Maternal-Fetal Medicine Units Network reported that even with confirmed pulmonary maturity, early-term birth without medical or obstetric indications is associated with worse neonatal respiratory and other neonatal outcomes compared with full-term birth.

### Tools for assessing lung fluid in neonates with respiratory distress [^ca6c836e]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Methods

The study included 22 newborns between 34 and 40 weeks of gestation, who were admitted between January and December 2020 at the NICU of Yonsei University's Gangnam Severance Hospital because of respiratory difficulty and evaluated lung fluid using LUS, cytokine analysis, and fluid measurement via electrical cardiometry. Gestational age was calculated based the best obstetric estimate using maternal last menstrual period or early pregnancy ultrasound examination findings or the new Ballard score if prenatal history is limited.

All newborns presented with respiratory difficulty including shallow breathing, chest retraction, tachypnea, and nasal flaring. RDS is diagnosed by three neonatologists based on the clinical manifestations, blood gas analysis, and chest X-ray findings after admission to the NICU. All patients diagnosed with RDS received surfactant through airway intubation. TTN is caused by delayed resorption of fetal lung fluid, and confirmed by chest x-ray with respiratory difficulty signs. Supportive care including supplemental oxygen, non-invasive and invasive ventilator care was provided for improving respiratory difficulty to the infants with TTN.

LUS was performed by a neonatologist using the portable ultrasound device, Vivid iq (General Electric Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA). Using a transthoracic approach, with the patient in the supine position and with a 12-MHz linear probe, images were taken in three areas (anterior, lateral, and posterior) of both chests, and the collected images were analyzed. According to the study by Brat et al. 0 points are assigned if line A is seen as a series of high-resolution horizontal equidistant lines below the pleura, 1 point if there were 3 or more B-lines per intercostal space, which are 'comet tail'-shaped vertical lines starting from the pleural line, 2 points if 'bilateral white lungs' are observed, and 3 points if a large consolidation or pleural abnormality is observed. The LUS scores ranged from 0 to maximum 18 points.

### Meconium aspiration syndrome: historical aspects [^74509d05]. Journal of Perinatology (2008). Low credibility.

The meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS) is a common problem that continues to concern perinatologists and neonatologists. MAS is defined as respiratory distress in an infant born through meconium-stained amniotic fluid (MSAF) whose symptoms cannot be otherwise explained. This disorder may be life threatening, complicated by respiratory failure, pulmonary air leaks and persistent pulmonary hypertension. Approaches to the prevention of MAS have changed over time with collaboration between obstetricians and pediatricians forming the foundations for care. This report details the management of babies delivered with associated MSAF before the accumulation of evidence for best practice through appropriately powered, prospective randomized controlled trials.

MV is needed if the diagnosis is RDS on LUS. A: A female infant with a GA of 28 +5 Weeks, cesarean section with birth weight of 1090g. She was admitted to NICU at 11 minutes because of breath difficulty immediately after birth. Arterial blood gas analysis showed PaCO 2 57.7 mmHg, PaO 2 41.2 mmHg, SaO 2 75.4%. LUS showed typical groundless opacity signs, which suggesting the Grade I RDS. The noninvasive MV can be given to this infant firstly, then we dynamically observe the lung condition changes using LUS. B: Another infant with gestational age of 34 +1 Weeks, cesarean section with birth weight of 2010g. Who was admitted to NICU at 20 minutes after birth due to dyspnea 15 minutes. Arterial blood gas analysis showed PaCO 2 70.6mmHg, PaO 2 25.4 mmHg, SaO 2 43.7%. LUS showed snowflake-like lung consolidation, which was the typical LUS manifestations of Grade II or III RDS. This infant should accept invasive MV treatment

Fig. 2
No need MV after BAL. This was a premature infant with a gestational age of 30 weeks and a birth weight of 1430g. Re-invasive MV was needed because of reemergence of severe dyspnea during hospitalization. LUS showed large area of lung consolidation and atelectasis in the right lung (A). After several times of BAL, re-examination of LUS showed that the lung consolidation completely disappeared, only a few B-lines existed (B), and thus the invasive MV could be removed

Fig. 3
Need noninvasive MV after BAL. LUS (extend view) showed significant atelectasis involving more than 5 intercostal spaces which need invasive MV treatment to the patient before BAL (A), while only small consolidations involved two intercostal spaces remained after BAL (B). Therefore, noninvasive MV is required for this infant. Please also refer to video 1

Discussion

LUS to support accurate differential diagnosis between the causes of neonatal respiratory failure

Clinicians agree that the role of LUS should be fully considered when determining the cause of neonatal respiratory failure and the clinical signs and symptoms.

In this respect, the misdiagnosis rate based on traditional diagnostic criteria is high, and only 40% of clinical respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) diagnoses were confirmed in a necropsy study. Among differential diagnoses, the consensus focuses on meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS), pneumonia or atelectasis, transient tachypnoea of the newborn (TTN), and pneumothorax. The LUS pattern is characterised by diffuse and coalescing B-lines, pleural line anomalies, subpleural consolidations with irregular shapes, and air bronchograms distributed in different areas of the lungs and is sufficiently specific to distinguish between MAS, pneumonia, and other causes of neonatal respiratory dyspnoea.

RDS and TTN have similar histories and clinical presentations, whereas chest X-ray (CXR) has low sensitivity and specificity. Moreover, owing to improvements in standard prenatal and postnatal care, RDS-like CXR images have also become more uncommon.

In contrast, LUS easily detects distinctive signs, resulting in extremely high accuracy in RDS diagnosis. A systematic review and meta-analysis revealed that the LUS sensitivity was 99% (95% CI: 96–100%), and the specificity was 97%, whereas these values were 91% and 84% for CXR, respectively.

The diagnostic value of LUS in RDS was confirmed by Wu et al. in their meta-analysis; they reported a pooled sensitivity of 0.92 (95% CI, 0.89–0.94), specificity of 0.95 (95% CI, 0.93–0.97), positive likelihood ratio of 20.23 (95% CI, 8.54–47.92), negative likelihood ratio of 0.07 (95% CI, 0.03–0.14), and diagnostic odds ratio of LUS in the diagnosis of RDS of 455.30 (95% CI, 153.01–1354.79).

Patient and methods

Research design

An observational case-control study involving 300 newborns aged ≥ 28 weeks. 200 cases (divided into two subgroups; 100 cases diagnosed with RDS and 100 cases diagnosed with TTN) compared with 100 healthy newborns as a control group. Cases are diagnosed as having RDS based on clinical features such as grunting, retractions, nasal flaring, cyanosis, tachypnea, need for oxygen or pressure support before intubation, and radiographic findings such as a diffuse reticular-granular pattern, ground-glass appearance, and superimposed air bronchogram. TTN cases are diagnosed based on initial clinical signs, including tachypnea within the first 6 h postnatally, persistence for at least 12 h, and radiologic findings such as lung hyperinflation, prominent pulmonary vascular markings, diaphragm flattening, or fluid in fissures. The study was conducted with newborns hospitalized in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) of Qena University Hospital, South Valley University, Egypt, between March 2023 and February 2024, after approval from the patients' caregivers and the faculty's ethical committee (ethical code number: SVUMEDPED0254245850).

The study excluded post-term cases, cases of respiratory distress due to pneumonia, meconium aspiration syndrome, congenital lung diseases, sepsis, air leak syndrome (pneumothorax), hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, cardiac patients, congenital diaphragmatic hernia, major congenital anomalies, and neonates requiring cardiopulmonary resuscitation at birth. The sample size was calculated with 95% confidence, 80% power, a cases-to-control ratio (2:1), a postulated odds ratio of ≥ 2, and an expected prevalence of 46.5%.

### Neonatalinfection in twins: clinical spectrum and management dilemma [^dc9d86c1]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Case presentation

A 24-year-old gravida 2, para 1 woman delivered a set of male dichorionic diamnioticdichorionic diamniotic twins, at 34 weeks gestation by urgent caesarian section for an atypical fetal heart rate in twin A, after presenting to care for reduced fetal movement. She was not in labour and membranes were intact at delivery.

Pregnancy had been complicated by gestational diabetes, pre-eclampsia, and cholestasis of pregnancy, for which she was on insulin, labetalol and ursodiol, respectively. Her serologies were all protective, including negative GBS status. Antenatal ultrasounds had noted an incidental congenital pulmonary airway malformation (CPAM) in twin A but were otherwise normal.

At delivery, twin A needed positive pressure ventilation for poor respiratory effort followed by continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) support for increased work of breathing. Twin B was delivered a minute after twin A and was vigorous and did not require any resuscitation. Both infants were admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) for prematurity and assessment of twin A's CPAM.

In the NICU, twin A underwent partial septic work-up, including blood cultures at admission, and was started on prophylactic intravenous antibiotics. White blood cell (WBC) count was 3.67×10 9 /L. Chest radiography initially showed ground-glass signs of respiratory distress syndrome, but a repeat chest X-ray prior to discharge demonstrated a focal confluent density in the posterior left hemithorax highly suggestive of CPAM. This did not require inpatient intervention by paediatric surgery. Conversely, twin B did well and received routine care.

Twin A was trialled off CPAP to room air at 24 hours of life. At this time, twin A's blood culture was reported as positive for E. coli. Following this result, blood cultures were repeated on both twins, which were negative at 48 hours. Twin B did not receive antibiotics as he was clinically well. Twin A received a total of 7 days of intravenous antibiotics for a suspected diagnosis of pneumonia, considering his respiratory distress and history of CPAM.

### Hemidiaphragmatic paralysis related to extravasation of parenteral solution in very low birthweight neonates [^c797f16f]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Case presentation

A preterm female (birth weight 800 g) was born at 27 weeks gestation to a 29-year-old primid gravida mother. Ultrasound scans during the pregnancy were normal. The pregnancy was complicated by chronic hypertension and gestational diabetes mellitus. Two weeks prior to delivery, the mother had cholecystitis that was treated with a 5-day course of antibiotics and had a full course antenatal steroids prophylaxis and magnesium sulfate infusion. There was no premature rupture of membrane nor intra partum complication. The neonate was born by spontaneous, uneventful vaginal delivery after delayed cord clamping for 60s with Apgar scores of 8, 9 and 9 at 1st, 5th and 10th minutes of life, respectively. The neonate had mild respiratory distress syndrome requiring biphasic continuous positive airway pressure support with 21% oxygen. At 7 hours after birth, a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC, 1.9Fr single lumen, Hao Lang Science and Technology, Foshan, China) was inserted through the right basilic vein after failed placement of umbilical venous catheter. The catheter tip was placed at the proximal end of right subclavian vein (figure 1A). At 20 hours of life, she was intubated and ventilated for progressive respiratory distress, porcine surfactant (120 mg/kg) was given. At 30 hours after birth, there was oedema of the right neck and shoulder noted, and chest X-ray confirmed right pleural effusion (figure 1B).

A 3033g male infant was born to a healthy mother at 39 weeks gestation by normal vaginal delivery with Grade 1 meconium stained liquor. There was no prolonged rupture of membranes or any antenatal risk factors for sepsis. The immediate neonatal period was uneventful and the baby was discharged after two days. At 6 weeks of age the baby was admitted with an 8-hour history of inconsolable crying. He was pyrexial. Initially the possibility of intussuception was considered, however, the submandibular swelling became more obvious and tender. His airway was clear. Chest x-ray and abdominal x-ray were normal. Ultrasound of the submandibular region showed soft tissue swelling with no fluid collection. CRP was initially 0.7 but increased to 87 the next day. Blood cultures grew group B streptococcus. (GBS) He was treated for five days with appropriate intravenous antibiotics. He was discharged home and recovered fully.

### Can neonatal lung ultrasound monitor fluid clearance and predict the need of respiratory support? [^1815391c]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In the late preterm and term neonate, lung ultrasound scan follows a reproducible pattern that parallels the respiratory status and can be used as a predictor of the need for respiratory support. Health care givers working in a low technology setting can use lung ultrasound for early screening of neonates in need of respiratory support.

### Beyond the usual suspects: neonatal fever and desaturation [^217b1b76]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

We report a 1-month-old infant admitted with fever, dyspnea, and desaturation after an unmonitored pregnancy in a migrant family. The patient rapidly required mechanical ventilation. Laboratory parameters were markedly elevated, suggesting an infectious etiology.

Methods

The clinical course is described with emphasis on diagnostic challenges, including imaging, laboratory findings, and the stepwise process of differential diagnosis.

Results

After common etiologies were excluded, rarer causes were considered. The final diagnosis was established through integration of clinical assessment, radiological imaging, laboratory data, and microbiological testing.

Conclusion

In neonates with fever and respiratory distress, RSV bronchiolitis is usually the first consideration. If excluded, clinicians must remain alert to less frequent etiologies. This case underscores the importance of a broad differential diagnosis in infants with acute respiratory compromise.

Amniocentesis for fetal lung maturity — use in timing delivery — is not recommended for guiding delivery timing. The consensus states that if significant maternal or fetal risk warrants delivery, amniocentesis does not provide additional aid in guiding management, and if delivery could be delayed awaiting pulmonary maturity, the indication is less urgent and prompt delivery is not likely indicated, concluding that amniocentesis for fetal lung maturity is not recommended to guide timing of delivery, even in suboptimally dated pregnancies.

### Recent advances in pathophysiology and management of transient tachypnea of newborn [^3c6c3f1c]. Journal of Perinatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Transient tachypnea of newborn (TTN) results from failure of the newborn to effectively clear the fetal lung fluid soon after birth. TTN represents the most common etiology of respiratory distress in term gestation newborns and sometimes requires admission to the neonatal intensive care unit. TTN can lead to maternal-infant separation, the need for respiratory support, extended unnecessary exposure to antibiotics and prolonged hospital stays. Recent evidence also suggests that TTN may be associated with wheezing syndromes later in childhood. New imaging modalities such as lung ultrasound can help in the diagnosis of TTN and early management with distending pressure using continuous positive airway pressure may prevent exacerbation of respiratory distress.

### Imperforate anus associated with anomalous pulmonary venous return in scimitar syndrome. case report from a tertiary hospital in Ethiopia [^c5724e67]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A 3 days old male neonate from southern Ethiopia presented to a nearby health institution with difficulty in sucking, failure to pass meconium and abdominal distension since birth.

Physical examination revealed imperforate anus. After referral to a tertiary hospital, loop colostomy was done to relieve respiratory distress. Ampicillin and Gentamicin were started because of persistent respiratory distress and a possible association of sepsis. After four days of treatment, the antibiotics were changed to ceftriaxone and metronidazole because of colostomy site infection. However, after completing 8 days of antibiotic treatment the respiratory distress had not resolved. Treatment for sepsis was continued.

The baby was born at term at a government health institution (health center) to a 35 years old para VII mother through spontaneous vaginal delivery. The birth weight and APGAR score were not recorded. The mother's antenatal care and follow up were done at a local health center where Tetanus Toxoid vaccine was given. Contraceptive injection (Depo-Provera) was given for three years but was discontinued six months prior to the current pregnancy. There was no maternal history of alcohol consumption, smoking cigarette, diabetes mellitus, hypertension or human immunodeficiency virus infection.

There was no history of consanguinity and no family history of cardiac disease. The patient was exclusively breast fed since birth. Physical examination on admission: -Vital signs: - Temp- 37.2 o c, RR-68/m, AHR-160 bpm, BP-74/46 mmHg, SPo2–92%, Weight- 3.8 kg (50th–75th centile), Length-52 cm (50th–75th centile), Head circumference-36 cm (50th–75th centile).

There were no gross dysmorphic features. The lympho-glandular system was normal. Inter-costal retractions and relative dullness with reduced air entry on the right-side lung field were noted. Peripheral pulses with strong volume were palpable in all accessible area. The precordium was quiet. The point of maximal impulse was felt at the 4th intercostal space medial to mid clavicular line. There was no thrill detected. The heart sounds were normal and without any murmur or gallop on auscultation. There was no pedal edema and no hepatosplenomegaly.

### Challenges in diagnosing disseminated congenital tuberculosis in a neonate: outcome and maternal treatment opportunity [^468780af]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

In India, congenital tuberculosis (TB) accounts for 1%-3% of the TB burden. We present the case of a term neonate admitted with respiratory distress, hepatosplenomegaly and abnormal coagulation profiles. The neonate's condition rapidly deteriorated, progressing to respiratory failure within 72 hours of admission. Tuberculosis-specific tests (TB PCR and culture) in the neonate confirmed the diagnosis of disseminated congenital TB. However, the results arrived after the neonate succumbed to multiorgan failure following a brief hospital stay. Maternal chest imaging after these results revealed miliary TB and she was started on anti-TB treatment. Despite the concerning signs, congenital TB was not initially suspected due to the absence of relevant maternal history and the overlapping features with other infections. As a result, the initial differentials considered were bacterial sepsis, perinatal viral infections and immunodeficiency. This case underscores the need for earlier suspicion of congenital TB, particularly in TB-endemic areas, to avoid adverse outcomes.

### Congenital candidiasis: a rare and unpredictable disease [^da695336]. Journal of Perinatology (2005). Low credibility.

We present a full-term female infant with congenital candidiasis characterized by extensive vesicular and pustular skin lesions associated with pneumonia and severe respiratory distress that appeared during the first hours after birth. The patient was born by cesarean section with no history of rupture of membranes. The mother had a vaginal discharge 3 weeks before delivery. The diagnosis was made by culture of pustular fluid, which grew Candida albicans. Systemic cultures were negative. The infant required a very brief course of conventional mechanical ventilation in spite of impressive and extensive lung infiltrates on the chest radiograph. She made a very quick clinical recovery although it is remarkable that antifungal treatment with amphotericin B was begun very late in her clinical course at the time when she was showing obvious signs of major improvement. Current management guidelines strongly recommend specific therapy for infants with invasive congenital candidiasis or with burn-like extensive dermatitis even without lung involvement. We are not suggesting any change in these recommendations; however, at least in our patient, when amphotericin B was started, she was clearly recovering; it seems possible that her disease although extensive might have experienced an unusual spontaneous regression. This case can provide further insights into this unusual neonatal infection.

### Airway injury and pneumomediastinum associated with less invasive surfactant administration in a premature neonate: a case report [^55b2c194]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A female infant was born at 27 weeks of gestation to a 33-year-old, Gravida 8, Para 5 mother. The pregnancy was complicated by subchorionic hemorrhage at 11 weeks, rupture of amniotic membranes at 24 weeks gestation, and intrauterine growth restriction with absent end-diastolic flow of the umbilical artery. Doppler scans and a poor biophysical profile (2/8) at 27 weeks highlighted the need for an urgent cesarean section.

The patient received a complete two-dose course of betamethasone at 24 weeks and a single rescue dose before the C-section at 27 weeks. The birth weight was 680 g (13th percentile), and the head circumference was 22 cm (6th percentile). The infant received delayed cord clamping for 1 min, and her 5-min Apgar score was 8. Noninvasive intermittent positive pressure (NIPPV) was initiated in the delivery room, which was continued on admission to the NICU.

A chest X-ray showed radiographic features of RDS (Fig. 1). There was an increase in the oxygen and ventilatory requirements. The infant met the institutional criteria for surfactant delivery via LISA. In our institute, the surfactant is administered via the "Hobart method", which utilizes a semirigid 16-G catheter that is placed into the trachea without the use of Magill forceps. Bovine lipid extract surfactant (BLES®, 5 ml/kg) was successfully instilled.

### Can neonatal lung ultrasound monitor fluid clearance and predict the need of respiratory support? [^bd90efff]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

The purpose of the study was to evaluate the relative distribution of the three profiles and document the eventual transition from types 1 and 2 to type 3 with serial scans; to correlate the persistence of significant fluid as assessed by ultrasound with clinical outcome expressed as NICU admission rate, use of supplemental oxygen, nasal continuous positive airways pressure (N-CPAP) and mechanical ventilation. Clinical decisions were taken by a separate team of attending physicians, blinded to the study, operating according to the local NICU protocols. All live neonates with gestational age ≥ 34 weeks were included in the study: 112 (72.8%) full-term neonates (range 37 to 42 weeks) and 42 (27.2%) pre-term neonates (range 34 + 1 to 36 + 6 weeks); 120 (55%) had a birth weight greater than 2,500 grams, while 34 (22%) weighed less; 106 (68.8%) infants were delivered by cesarean-section while 48 (31.1%) were born vaginally; 107 (69.5%) babies were not given antenatal steroids whereas 40 (26%) received the treatment. Newborns with major congenital malformations and/or intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) were excluded. Scans on the anterior and lateral chest walls of both lungs in supine infants were acquired in the Nursery by a single neonatologist (AS or FM) who then sent the acquired image to the Radiology Department in a separate building. The pediatric radiologist (GV) reviewed and classified the scans according to the study protocol. After completion of the study, concordance was assessed between the evaluation of the initial operator, who could not avoid observing the infant, and the pediatric radiologist who was fully masked to the infants' clinical conditions. Any clinical decision (NICU admission and type of treatment for respiratory distress) was taken by a third party physician, unaware of the present study. In our hospital, the Nursery and the NICU are separate environments attended by different medical staff. The infants were scanned in the absence of the physician in charge, taking extra care not to report the results of our investigation.

A broadband linear transducer (mod L12-5, Philips, Eindhoven, the Netherlands) which encompasses the superior and inferior lung fields in the same image was used. All infants had the first scan performed no sooner than one hour and no later than two hours after birth. Scans were then repeated at 12, 24 and 36 hours.

### Needle aspiration versus intercostal tube drainage for pneumothorax in the newborn [^e187a10a]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Pneumothorax occurs more frequently in the neonatal period than at any other time of life and is associated with increased mortality and morbidity. It can be treated with either aspiration with a syringe (using a needle or an angiocatheter) or a chest tube inserted in the anterior pleural space and then connected to a Heimlich valve or an underwater seal with continuous suction.

Objectives

To compare the efficacy and safety of needle aspiration (either with immediate removal of the needle or with the needle left in situ) to intercostal tube drainage in the management of neonatal pneumothorax (PTX).

Search Methods

We used the standard search strategy of Cochrane Neonatal to search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2018, Issue 5), MEDLINE via PubMed (1966 to 4 June 2018), Embase (1980 to 4 June 2018), and CINAHL (1982 to 4 June 2018). We also searched clinical trials databases, conference proceedings, and the reference lists of retrieved articles for randomised controlled trials and quasi-randomised trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials, quasi-randomised controlled trials and cluster trials comparing needle aspiration (either with the needle or angiocatheter left in situ or removed immediately after aspiration) to intercostal tube drainage in newborn infants with pneumothorax.

Data Collection and Analysis

For each of the included trials, two authors independently extracted data (e.g. number of participants, birth weight, gestational age, kind of needle and chest tube, choice of intercostal space, pressure and device for drainage) and assessed the risk of bias (e.g. adequacy of randomisation, blinding, completeness of follow-up). The primary outcomes considered in this review are mortality during the neonatal period and during hospitalisation. We used the GRADE approach to assess the quality of evidence.

Main Results

Two randomised controlled trials (142 infants) met the inclusion criteria of this review. We found no differences in the rates of mortality when the needle was removed immediately after aspiration (risk ratio (RR) 3.92, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.88 to 17.58; participants = 70; studies = 1) or left in situ (RR 1.50, 95% CI 0.27 to 8.45; participants = 72; studies = 1) or complications related to the procedure. With immediate removal of the needle following aspiration, 30% of the newborns did not require the placement of an intercostal tube drainage. None of the 36 newborns treated with needle aspiration with the angiocatheter left in situ required the placement of an intercostal tube drainage. Overall, the quality of the evidence supporting this finding is very low.

Authors' Conclusions

There is insufficient evidence to establish the efficacy and safety of needle aspiration and intercostal tube drainage in the management of neonatal pneumothorax. The two included trials showed no differences in mortality; however the information size is low. Needle aspiration reduces the need for intercostal tube drainage placement. Limited or no evidence is available on other clinically relevant outcomes.

### Fluid restriction in the management of transient tachypnea of the newborn [^1952d268]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Transient tachypnea of the newborn (TTN) is caused by delayed clearance of lung fluid at birth. TTN typically appears within the first two hours of life in term and late preterm neonates and is characterized by tachypnea and signs of respiratory distress. Although it is usually a self-limited condition, admission to a neonatal unit is frequently required for monitoring and providing respiratory support. Restricting intake of fluids administered to these infants in the first days of life might improve clearance of lung liquid, thus reducing the effort required to breathe, improving respiratory distress, and potentially reducing the duration of tachypnea.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of restricted fluid therapy as compared to standard fluid therapy in decreasing the duration of oxygen administration and the need for noninvasive or invasive ventilation among neonates with TTN.

Search Methods

We used the standard search strategy of Cochrane Neonatal to search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2019, Issue 12), in the Cochrane Library; Ovid MEDLINE and electronic ahead of print publications, in-process & other non-indexed citations, Daily and Versions(R); and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), on December 6, 2019. We also searched clinical trial databases and the reference lists of retrieved articles for randomized controlled trials and quasi-randomized trials.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-RCTs, and cluster trials on fluid restriction in term and preterm neonates with the diagnosis of TTN or delayed adaptation during the first week after birth.

Data Collection and Analysis

For each of the included trials, two review authors independently extracted data (e.g. number of participants, birth weight, gestational age, duration of oxygen therapy, need for continuous positive airway pressure [CPAP], need for mechanical ventilation, duration of mechanical ventilation) and assessed the risk of bias (e.g. adequacy of randomization, blinding, completeness of follow-up). The primary outcome considered in this review was the duration of supplemental oxygen therapy in hours or days. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence.

Main Results

Four trials enrolling 317 infants met the inclusion criteria. Three trials enrolled late preterm and term infants with TTN, and the fourth trial enrolled only term infants with TTN. Infants were on various methods of respiratory support at the time of enrollment including room air, oxygen, or nasal CPAP. Infants in the fluid-restricted group received 15 to 20 mL/kg/d less fluid than those in the control group for varying durations after enrollment. Two studies had high risk of selection bias, and three out of four had high risk of performance bias. Only one study had low risk of detection bias, with two at high risk and one at unclear risk. The certainty of evidence for all outcomes was very low due to imprecision of estimates and unclear risk of bias. Two trials reported the primary duration of supplemental oxygen therapy. We are uncertain whether fluid restriction decreases or increases the duration of supplemental oxygen therapy (mean difference [MD] -12.95 hours, 95% confidence interval [CI] -32.82 to 6.92; I² = 98%; 172 infants). Similarly, there is uncertainty for various secondary outcomes including incidence of hypernatremia (serum sodium > 145 mEq/L, risk ratio [RR] 4.0, 95% CI 0.46 to 34.54; test of heterogeneity not applicable; 1 trial, 100 infants), hypoglycemia (blood glucose < 40 mg/dL, RR 1.0, 95% CI 0.15 to 6.82; test of heterogeneity not applicable; 2 trials, 164 infants), endotracheal ventilation (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.24 to 2.23; I² = 0%; 3 trials, 242 infants), need for noninvasive ventilation (RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.14 to 1.17; test of heterogeneity not applicable; 2 trials, 150 infants), length of hospital stay (MD -0.92 days, 95% CI -1.53 to -0.31; test of heterogeneity not applicable; 1 trial, 80 infants), and cumulative weight loss at 72 hours of age (%) (MD 0.24, 95% CI -1.60 to 2.08; I² = 89%; 2 trials, 156 infants). We did not identify any ongoing trials; however, one trial is awaiting classification.

Authors' Conclusions

We found limited evidence to establish the benefits and harms of fluid restriction in the management of TTN. Given the very low certainty of available evidence, it is impossible to determine whether fluid restriction is safe or effective for management of TTN. However, given the simplicity of the intervention, a well-designed trial is justified.

### Committee opinion No 689: delivery of a newborn with meconium-stained amniotic fluid [^9b04a102]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Medium credibility.

Meconium-stained amniotic fluid at delivery — clinical management and resuscitation are as follows: Infants with meconium-stained amniotic fluid should no longer routinely receive intrapartum suctioning, whether they are vigorous or not, and routine intubation and tracheal suctioning are no longer required. If the infant is vigorous with good respiratory effort and muscle tone, the infant may stay with the mother to receive the initial steps of newborn care, whereas if the infant presents with poor muscle tone and inadequate breathing efforts, the initial steps of resuscitation should be completed under the radiant warmer and appropriate intervention to support ventilation and oxygenation should be initiated as indicated for each infant. Meconium-stained amniotic fluid is a condition that requires the notification and availability of an appropriately credentialed team with full resuscitation skills, including endotracheal intubation, and resuscitation should follow the same principles for infants with meconium-stained fluid as for those with clear fluid.

### Committee opinion no.689 summary: delivery of a newborn with meconium-stained amniotic fluid [^ff74b721]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Medium credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for neonatal resuscitation, more specifically with respect to patients with meconium aspiration syndrome, ACOG 2017 guidelines recommend to notify and ensure the availability of an appropriately credentialed team with full resuscitation skills, including endotracheal intubation, for cases with meconium-stained amniotic fluid.

### Antenatal corticosteroids for maturity of term or near term fetuses: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^9ebae295]. BMJ (2016). Excellent credibility.

The biological plausibility to explain our findings may be different in women undergoing scheduled cesarean delivery at term and in women at risk of late preterm delivery.

Cesarean delivery is a risk factor for the development of neonatal respiratory complications, mostly RDS and transient tachypnea of the newborn, in infants both at term and preterm. Infants born at term by cesarean delivery are more likely to develop respiratory morbidity than infants born vaginally, and this risk increases further for the subgroup of children born after scheduled cesarean section — that is, before onset of labor with potentially severe implications. The risk decreases with advancing gestational age, and infants born at 37 0–37 6 weeks' gestation are at 1.7 times more risk for respiratory complications than those born at 38 0–38 6 weeks' gestation who in turn are at 2.4 times more risk than the infants born at 39 0–39 6 weeks' gestation. This trend is particularly pronounced for RDS. Respiratory morbidity in term planned cesarean delivery seems to have a different pathophysiology from that in preterm birth, with lack of the physiological catecholamine surgeand fluid retention in the lungsbeing the most likely causes. Interestingly, recent evidence indicates that, apart from the mechanical concept of vaginal squeeze, molecular mechanisms (lung epithelial sodium channels) promote alveolar fluid drainage, and these channels may be underactive in fetuses not exposed to the process of labor. Glucocorticoids appear to increase the number and function of sodium channels as well as the responsiveness to catecholamine and thyroids hormones, providing a rationale for their exogenous use in planned cesarean deliveries. In view of this evidence, it is currently recommended that planned cesarean delivery should be deferred to 39 weeks' gestation. However, in the USA approximately 10–15% of women planned for cesarean might deliver before 39 weeks and there may be concerns on waiting in the presence of specific clinical indications or history. Some have referred to planned cesarean delivery as "elective," but we prefer avoiding this term, as it lacks the necessary scientific specificity. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists advises against "elective delivery" before 39 weeks' gestation. The challenge in this situation is that there is often lack of clarity between planned (scheduled) delivery and an elective delivery. Cesarean delivery scheduled at 35 weeks' gestation because of placenta previa and suspected accreta is not an "elective" early preterm birth, and an increase in maternal-fetal morbidity has been associated with allowing such a pregnancy to continue beyond 36 weeks' gestation.

### Oral erythromycin prophylaxis vs watchful waiting in caring for newborns exposed to Chlamydia trachomatis… [^4549eb47]. JAMA Network (2003). Excellent credibility.

process annually. 2 Many of these infants develop conjunctivitis, pneumonia, or both in the first few months of life. 3Chlamydia trachomatis pneumonia, although often mild, may cause severe symptoms that require hospitalization. 2 Until recently, the Committee on Infectious Diseases of the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended a prophylactic 14-day course of oral erythromycin for newborns exposed to C trachomatis at delivery. 4, 5 However, this recommendation was changed after the recognition, 6 since confirmed, 7, 8 of an association between erythromycin and subsequent pyloric stenosis. a 14-day prophylactic course of erythromycin were based in part on cost estimates published by the Institute of Medicine. 2 These cost estimates were transformed into charges using a ratio of 1. 32, which was derived by dividing the HCUP charge by the Institute of Medicine cost estimate for a hospitalization for chlamydial pneumonia.

We assumed that prophylaxis would be prescribed in the normal course of newborn nursery care and would not lead to any additional charges or produce any adverse effects other than pyloric stenosis. Because all modeled events occur within a few months, the modeled outcomes were not time discounted. Among infants exposed to C trachomatis at birth, the point estimate of the incidence of conjunctivitis is 15% and of pneumonia is 7%. The published estimate of the hospitalization rate among infants with C trachomatis pneumonia is 20%2; thus, among all infants exposed to C trachomatis, 1. 4% would be hospitalized. Allowing 2 or more factors to vary reveals plausible circumstances that would favor a decision to offer prophylaxis. The decision is sensitive to simultaneous variation in the incidence of C trachomatis pneumonia and in its hospitalization rate.

The product of these 2 variables equals the probability of hospitalization for C trachomatis pneumonia, given exposure at birth. On the other hand, if future studies confirm long-term consequences of neonatal chlamydia exposure, as have been suggested by studies36-38 showing that infants with C trachomatis pneumonia may have long-term chronic pulmonary effects and by reports39-41 of infants with neonatal chlamydia infection and myocarditis or sudden infant death syndrome, then the relative value of preventing C trachomatis infection would increase in comparison with avoiding pyloric stenosis.

### Clinical analysis of neonates born to mothers with or without COVID-19: a retrospective analysis of 48 cases from two neonatal intensive care units in hubei province [^1b20fc67]. American Journal of Perinatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Table 3
Clinical characteristics and laboratory results of the neonates

Fig. 2
Chest X-ray of the neonates from the three groups.

None of the neonates developed any clinical, radiological, hematological, or biochemical evidence of COVID-19. Samples from amniotic fluid, placental swab, gastric lavage fluid of the neonates right after birth, neonatal serum, throat swab, and feces were negative for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR.

A 28 1/7 weeks of gestational age of male preterm neonate (birthweight 1,530 g) was born to a COVID-19 mother, who received dexamethasone (6 mg, every 12 hours, twice) and did not finish the course before delivery. The neonate showed respiratory distress shortly after birth, and bilateral lung ground glass with air bronchogram could be seen in the chest X-ray, which was consistent with neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (Fig. 3A). After two doses of surfactant administered through the endotracheal tube, the respiratory condition of the infant improved (Fig. 3B). He was on continuous positive airway pressure for 18 days and nasal cannula for another 2 weeks, and was discharged home at 34 5/7 weeks of corrected gestational age and weight 1,980 g (Fig. 3C). The infant was on oral caffeine for another 2 weeks after discharge. He showed grade I intraventricular hemorrhage and mild bronchopulmonay dysplasia and without retinopathy of prematurity. SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription PCR in the throat swab sample from this preterm neonate and specific SARS-CoV-2 antibodies tested in the baby's plasma were negative.

### Not all infantile respiratory distress in winter is bronchiolitis: congenital lobar emphysema [^af49b19f]. BMJ Case Reports (2011). Medium credibility.

The authors report the case of a 4-week-old male infant presented during the winter period with respiratory distress. He had a 3 day history of cough and coryza, and a 2 day history of breathlessness and reduced feeding. He had evidence of tachypnoea, subcostal recession and hypoxia on examination. An initial diagnosis of bronchiolitis was made. The authors explore how the correct diagnosis of congenital lobar emphysema (CLE) was reached, highlighting key clinical signs and investigations. He had evidence of a hyperinflated right middle lobe, with collapse of right upper and lower lobes and left upper lobe with associated mediastinal shift on chest x-ray (CXR) and CT scan. He was referred to the regional Paediatric Cardiothoracic Centre where right middle lobectomy was performed with complete resolution of his respiratory distress and re-expansion of the compressed lobes on CXR. Current literature concerning CLE is reviewed.

### Neonatal diabetes mellitus: patient report and review of the literature [^9a18965c]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2001). Low credibility.

A female infant born at 33 weeks gestation to a gestationally diabetic mother developed apnea and respiratory distress at 6 hours of age. Laboratory investigation demonstrated persistent hyperglycemia, and the patient was treated with continuous intravenous and subsequent subcutaneous insulin therapy. Detailed laboratory investigation to reveal the etiology of hyperglycemia and further endocrine evaluation were not significant. The baby's insulin requirement has continued thereafter, and she is being followed up in an outpatient clinic still under insulin therapy at 18 months of age. Neonatal diabetes mellitus should be considered in the differential diagnosis of neonatal hyperglycemia, and it may develop in newborns born to diabetic mothers, as well as neonatal hypoglycemia. Insulin treatment with close blood glucose monitoring is essential as long as hyperglycemia persists since neonatal diabetes mellitus may be either transient or permanent and it is not possible to differentiate these two outcomes before 18 months of age.

### Think out of the box: association of left congenital diaphragmatic hernia and abnormal origin of the right pulmonary artery: a train can hide another [^483d326b]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

We report the occurrence of a severe pulmonary hypertension (PH) in a neonate affected by a left congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH). PH in this patient was associated with an abnormal origin of the right pulmonary artery from the right brachiocephalic artery. This malformation, sometimes named hemitruncus arteriosus, has to the best of our knowledge never been reported in association with a CDH.

Case Presentation

A male newborn was hospitalized from birth in the neonatal intensive care unit after prenatal diagnosis of a left CDH. Ultrasound examination at 34 weeks of gestational age evaluated the observed-to-expected lung-to-head ratio at 49%. Birth occurred at 38 +5 weeks of gestational age. Soon after admission, severe hypoxemia, i.e., preductal pulse oximetry oxygen saturation (SpO 2) < 80%, prompted therapeutic escalation including the use of high frequency oscillatory ventilation with fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO 2) 100% and inhaled nitric oxide (iNO). Echocardiography assessment revealed signs of severe PH and normal right ventricle function. Despite administration of epoprostenolol, milrinone, norepinephrine, and fluid loadings with albumin and 0.9% saline, hypoxemia remained severe, preductal SpO 2 inconsistently greater than or equal to 80–85% and post ductal SpO 2 lower on average by 15 points. This clinical status remained unchanged during the first 7 days of life. The infant's clinical instability was incompatible with surgical intervention, while chest X-ray showed a relatively preserved lung volume, especially on the right side. This prompted an additional echocardiography, aimed at searching an explanation of this unusual evolution and found an abnormal origin of the right pulmonary artery, which was confirmed on computed tomography angiography subsequently. A change in the medical strategy was decided, with the suspension of pulmonary vasodilator treatments, the administration of diuretics, and the decrease in norepinephrine dose to decrease the systemic-to-pulmonary shunt. Progressive improvement in the infant respiratory and hemodynamic status enabled to perform CDH surgical repair 2 weeks after birth.

Conclusions

This case recalls the interest of systematic analysis of all potential causes of PH in a neonate with CDH, a condition frequently associated with various congenital malformations.

### Severe meconium aspiration syndrome is not caused by aspiration of meconium [^b5b4a6dd]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2001). Low credibility.

Meconium aspiration syndrome can present clinically with different degrees of severity, ranging from a mild form of respiratory compromise to severe forms that may result in perinatal death despite mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. However, advances in our knowledge concerning meconium aspiration syndrome have revealed that most cases of severe meconium aspiration syndrome are not in fact causally related to the aspiration of meconium but rather are caused by other pathologic processes occurring in utero, primarily chronic asphyxia and infection. Proper understanding of the causative processes underlying fetal or neonatal compromise in these cases is essential to direct future research into preventive or therapeutic treatments and for counseling of the parents of an affected child.

Early-term delivery — pulmonary outcomes and ventilation: Compared with 39 weeks, meconium aspiration was lower at 37 weeks (adjusted OR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.52–0.74) and 38 weeks (adjusted OR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.62–0.79), whereas hyaline membrane disease was higher at 37 weeks (adjusted OR, 3.12; 95% CI, 2.90–3.38) and 38 weeks (adjusted OR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.19–1.43). Examined as need for neonatal ventilation, disease rates were increased at 37 weeks (adjusted OR, 2.02; 95% CI, 1.88–2.18) and 38 weeks (adjusted OR, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.08–1.23).

### Acute respiratory failure in a 35-year-old woman following preterm vaginal delivery [^51d8c65d]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

A 35-year-old woman, a non-smoker with a normal body mass index, 'felt wheezy' and developed profound hypoxia 30 min after preterm vaginal delivery at 24+ weeks of gestation. She denied other symptoms, had no fever but was tachycardic and tachypnoeic with normal blood pressure. Pulmonary embolism, amniotic fluid embolism, cardiomyopathy, arrhythmias, sepsis and non-cardiogenic pulmonary oedema were considered as differential diagnoses. Chest X-ray showed an increased pulmonary vasculature, but the blood tests, ECG, echocardiogram and CT pulmonary angiogram were essentially normal. She was managed on a high dependency area with high-flow oxygen and intravenous antibiotics. She improved dramatically and the oxygen requirements dropped to 2 L over the next 4 h. It is plausible that this woman had acute non-cardiogenic pulmonary oedema secondary to a combination of risk factors. This case highlights the importance of a methodical and multidisciplinary approach for a prompt diagnosis and successful treatment of an acutely ill parturient.

### European consensus guidelines on the management of respiratory distress syndrome: 2022 update [^0ef9606e]. Neonatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Survival of preterm infants continues to improve, with those at 22–23 weeks of gestation now having reasonable chances of making it home to their families. There is a growing trend towards offering initial life support to infants born at lower perceived levels of viability, which in some countries is now defined as low as 22 weeks of gestation. However, we caution that recommendations given in these guidelines are based on evidence from studies, which almost without exception, have been generated in times where the resuscitation of the most preterm infants was not often attempted, and until very recently, infants of the lowest gestations were not included in clinical trials. We therefore recommend caution when applying current recommendations to the most preterm infants with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). Until more evidence is available, these guidelines apply mainly to management of RDS in infants with gestational ages of greater than 24 weeks. Managing RDS remains a key component of neonatal intensive care. European data from 2014 to 2016 show that around 50% of all babies born between 22 +0 and 32 +6 weeks receive surfactant; therefore, relevant skills for surfactant administration and mechanical ventilation (MV) remain important.

RDS is caused by pulmonary immaturity and surfactant deficiency, resulting in respiratory insufficiency from soon after birth. There is now less emphasis on radiographic diagnosis and grading of RDS, such as "ground glass with air bronchograms." Definitions based on blood gas analyses are also redundant, as management has moved towards an approach of pre-emptive treatment with surfactant based on clinical assessment of work of breathing and inspired oxygen requirement to avoid worsening RDS. The aim of modern RDS management is to maximise survival while minimising complications such as air leaks and BPD. Many strategies for prevention and treatment of RDS and providing early respiratory support have been tested in clinical trials and are summarised in updated systematic reviews, all of which inform these guidelines. This current version updates previous versions after critical examination of the most recent evidence available to end of 2022. We have again used a format of summarising management strategies followed by evidence-based recommendations according to the GRADE system to reflect the authors' judgement of the evidence supporting each of the statements (Table 1). Summary of recommendations is shown in Table 2.

Regarding medical management for preterm infant, more specifically with respect to surfactant therapy, indications for respiratory distress syndrome, WHO 2015 guidelines recommend to initiate early surfactant replacement therapy (within the first 2 hours after birth) rather than waiting for the symptoms to worsen before giving rescue therapy in intubated preterm infants with respiratory distress syndrome.
