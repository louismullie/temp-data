## Question

Fluid resuscitation in esrd

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about fluid resuscitation in end-stage renal disease (ESRD), with explicit stepwise thinking and self-verification language preserved. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and competing risks in ESRD. Then, I should appraise the quality and applicability of the evidence base. Next, I will synthesize a practical, phase-based algorithm that balances fluid responsiveness and fluid tolerance. After that, I should specify monitoring tools and safety thresholds. Finally, I will address special scenarios and close with a concise, clinically actionable recommendation anchored to the best available data [^114PxNu5].

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and competing risks. ESRD patients frequently present with sepsis-induced hypotension, where timely perfusion support is essential, yet they also have impaired excretory capacity and high rates of baseline volume overload, which amplify the harms of excessive fluids; this creates a narrow therapeutic window between under-resuscitation and fluid overload, and mandates a cautious, individualized approach rather than a one-size-fits-all bolus strategy [^113sfvkK] [^1123x61C] [^11198V47].

> Wait, let me verify the strength of evidence before drawing conclusions. The most informative data for sepsis-induced hypotension in advanced CKD/ESRD come from a post hoc analysis of the CLOVERS randomized trial, which showed that an early restrictive fluid strategy with earlier vasopressor use reduced 90-day mortality and increased vasopressor-free and ventilator-free days compared with a liberal fluid strategy; however, this is a subgroup analysis and should be considered hypothesis-generating despite its clinical plausibility and internal consistency [^114PxNu5] [^116QQAhF] [^114MeGvZ].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should reconcile conflicting signals. Some observational emergency department cohorts suggest that failing to deliver guideline-concordant 30 mL/kg within 3 hours is associated with worse outcomes, but these studies are confounded by illness severity and often excluded or underrepresented ESRD; conversely, meta-analytic and physiologic data in high-risk groups (heart failure, ESRD) show a trend toward harm with aggressive fluids, reinforcing the need to individualize rather than default to large fixed boluses in ESRD [^114M2d1j] [^113sfvkK].

> I will now examine the phase-based approach, starting with the initial resuscitation window. Let me think about a pragmatic compromise: a small, rapidly reversible test dose of 250–500 mL isotonic crystalloid (preferably balanced, avoiding hyperchloremic saline) with immediate reassessment of blood pressure, heart rate, capillary refill, mental status, and lactate; if there is no hemodynamic response, pivot early to vasopressors rather than stacking boluses, consistent with a restrictive strategy and the CLOVERS protocol that prioritized norepinephrine and permitted rescue fluids only for clear intravascular depletion [^117BjAHx] [^114PxNu5] [^116WbASA].

> Next, I should review the stabilization and de-resuscitation phases. Once perfusion improves, I need to ensure we transition to net neutral or negative fluid balance using diuretics if effective and, in refractory cases, CRRT to remove excess volume; I should confirm that CRRT prescriptions are individualized to cardiovascular tolerance, often favoring slower ultrafiltration rates initially to avoid intradialytic hypotension, with careful attention to refilling and vasopressor support as needed [^1123x61C] [^114Sp73J] [^111pZ3cZ].

> Let me consider fluid selection and electrolyte safety. Balanced crystalloids are preferred over saline to mitigate hyperchloremic acidosis and potential renal and coagulation effects; I should double-check that starch-containing colloids are avoided given increased risk of AKI and RRT across multiple analyses, and reserve albumin for specific indications rather than routine resuscitation in ESRD sepsis [^116WbASA] [^111bQ9oL] [^116NuG3K].

> I need to ensure monitoring is precise and dynamic. Static measures like CVP are unreliable in ESRD; instead, I should integrate dynamic assessments such as passive leg raise with real-time stroke volume or cardiac output, ultrasound of the IVC with respiratory variation, lung ultrasound for B-lines, and VEXUS for venous congestion; if available, bioimpedance can complement clinical judgment for estimating dry weight and tracking changes, acknowledging its limitations in the ICU setting [^111MyJPc] [^115fjKWG] [^111AXjoS].

> But wait, what if the patient is already markedly volume overloaded on presentation. In that scenario, I should confirm that fluids are minimized and prioritize vasopressors and urgent volume removal via dialysis or CRRT; I should verify that early CRRT is reasonable when life-threatening fluid overload, acidosis, or electrolyte derangements are present, balancing the risks of premature RRT against the harms of persistent overload in ESRD [^112ZkkL9] [^1123x61C] [^115Y6bA5].

> I should double-check special scenarios. In DKA with ESRD, the absence of osmotic diuresis reduces the need for large fluid loads; small boluses with frequent reassessment and reliance on insulin therapy may suffice, with heightened vigilance for post-dialysis hypoglycemia and hyperkalemia management nuances unique to dialysis patients [^114uMRcY] [^117UAJah]. In perioperative ESRD, coordinated planning for fluid shifts and dialysis timing is essential to avoid both under-resuscitation and postoperative pulmonary edema [^114PAgJF].

> Let me reconsider the overall synthesis to ensure internal consistency. The weight of evidence supports a restrictive, response-guided approach in ESRD with sepsis-induced hypotension: start small, reassess frequently, escalate early to vasopressors, and transition promptly to net negative balance once stabilized; while a small initial bolus may be reasonable in select hypovolemic-appearing patients, routine 30 mL/kg boluses are likely harmful in ESRD and should be avoided outside of a compelling, monitored indication [^114PxNu5] [^113sfvkK].

> Final clinical recommendation: For ESRD patients with sepsis-induced hypotension, I recommend an initial 250–500 mL bolus of a balanced crystalloid with immediate dynamic reassessment; if no clear hemodynamic improvement within 30–60 minutes, initiate norepinephrine and avoid further fluids unless there is objective evidence of intravascular depletion; after stabilization, pursue net negative fluid balance using diuretics if effective and CRRT as needed, with close monitoring for intradialytic hypotension and individualized ultrafiltration targets; throughout, prioritize dynamic measures and bedside ultrasound to guide decisions and minimize fluid overload [^117BjAHx] [^114PxNu5] [^1123x61C] [^111MyJPc].

Fluid resuscitation in ESRD requires a **restrictive, individualized approach** [^112m7Zdz] [^1127c38q] to balance perfusion with the risk of fluid overload [^1123x61C]. Use **small crystalloid boluses (250–500 mL)** [^notfound] with frequent reassessment of hemodynamics and lung status, and **prioritize early vasopressors** [^116QQAhF] [^112SPgM7] to maintain MAP ≥ 65 mmHg. Avoid large-volume resuscitation [^113sfvkK] and colloids; use balanced crystalloids when possible [^116WbASA] [^1121pDZo]. If overload occurs, initiate **urgent dialysis** or ultrafiltration [^112ZkkL9] [^117E4SRg]. This strategy reduces complications while supporting perfusion [^112m7Zdz].

---

## Pathophysiological considerations

- **Fluid overload**: ESRD patients have impaired excretion, so excess fluids cause pulmonary edema, heart failure, and hypertension [^114RvxAV] [^115fjKWG].

- **Intradialytic hypotension**: Aggressive ultrafiltration can cause hypotension, reducing organ perfusion and increasing ischemic risk [^112aD91Y] [^111nzBEe].

- **Uremic cardiomyopathy**: Structural and functional cardiac changes limit hemodynamic tolerance to rapid volume shifts [^1169Gq2Q].

---

## Clinical evidence and guidelines

- **Restrictive fluids**: Early restrictive fluid strategies with early vasopressors [^117BjAHx] reduce mortality and organ support in advanced CKD/ESRD with sepsis-induced hypotension [^116QQAhF].

- **Small boluses**: Use 250–500 mL crystalloid boluses with frequent reassessment to avoid overload [^114uMRcY].

- **Avoid large volumes**: ≥ 30 mL/kg boluses increase fluid overload and respiratory complications without clear benefit [^113sfvkK].

- **Balanced crystalloids**: Prefer lactated Ringer's or Plasma-Lyte over saline to reduce hyperchloremia and acidosis [^115zzddq] [^112SPgM7].

---

## Practical clinical approach

| **Step** | **Action** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| 1 | Assess volume status (exam, CXR, lung ultrasound, IVC) [^111MyJPc] | Guide need and tolerance for fluids [^115fjKWG] |
| 2 | Give small crystalloid boluses (250–500 mL) [^114uMRcY] | Restore perfusion while limiting overload |
| 3 | Reassess hemodynamics and lung status frequently | Detect early overload or ongoing hypoperfusion |
| 4 | Escalate to vasopressors early (norepinephrine) [^117BjAHx] | Maintain MAP ≥ 65 mmHg with less fluid [^112SPgM7] |
| 5 | Avoid large-volume resuscitation (> 30 mL/kg) [^notfound] | Reduce risk of pulmonary edema and heart failure |
| 6 | Use balanced crystalloids (LR, Plasma-Lyte) [^116WbASA] | Minimize hyperchloremia and acidosis [^115zzddq] |
| 7 | If overload, initiate urgent dialysis or ultrafiltration [^117E4SRg] | Rapidly correct volume and improve oxygenation [^notfound] |

---

## Monitoring and reassessment

- **Frequent monitoring**: Track vitals, oxygenation, lung exam, and CXR to detect overload early [^112ofUaJ].

- **Dynamic measures**: Use PLR, stroke volume variation, or echocardiography to assess fluid responsiveness [^111AXjoS].

- **Laboratory tests**: Monitor electrolytes, acid-base status, and lactate to guide therapy [^11769uM8].

---

## Potential complications and mitigation strategies

- **Fluid overload**: Use small boluses, frequent reassessment, and early dialysis/ultrafiltration [^114uMRcY] [^116hZnbz].

- **Electrolyte disturbances**: Monitor and correct potassium, calcium, and acid-base abnormalities promptly [^117ADNFa].

- **Infection risk**: Use aseptic technique and minimize catheter use to reduce infection [^notfound].

---

## Special considerations

In **sepsis**, use restrictive fluids with early vasopressors to improve outcomes [^112m7Zdz] [^116QQAhF]. In **perioperative care**, coordinate with nephrology and anesthesia to balance perfusion and fluid removal [^114PAgJF]. For **long-term management**, individualize dialysis prescriptions and volume targets to minimize chronic overload [^114RvxAV] [^1127c38q].

---

Fluid resuscitation in ESRD should be **restrictive and individualized** [^114PxNu5], using small boluses, early vasopressors, and close monitoring to balance perfusion and fluid overload [^116QQAhF].

### Aggressive versus conservative fluid resuscitation in septic hemodialysis patients [^1147KhJp]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Sepsis and bacterial infections are common in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). We aimed to compare patients with ESRD on hemodialysis presenting to hospital with severe sepsis or septic shock who received < 20 ml/kg of intravenous fluid to those who received ≥ 20 ml/kg during initial resuscitation.

Materials and Methods

We conducted a retrospective chart review of adult patients with ICD codes for discharge diagnosis of sepsis, severe sepsis, septic shock, ESRD, and hemodialysis admitted to our institution between 2015 and 2018.

Results

We present outcomes for a total of 104 patients - 51 patients in conservative group and 53 in aggressive group. The mean age was 69.5 ± 11.2 years and 71 ± 11.5 years in the conservative group and aggressive group, respectively. There was no significant difference in the rate of ICU admission, and ICU or hospital length of stay between the two groups. Complications such as volume overload, rate of intubation, and urgent dialysis were not found to be significantly different.

Conclusion

We found that aggressive fluid resuscitation with ≥ 20 ml/kg may not be detrimental in the initial resuscitation of ESRD patients with SeS or SS. However, a clinical decision of volume responsiveness should be made on a case-by-case basis rather than a universal approach for fluid resuscitation in ESRD patients.

### Fluid management for sepsis-induced hypotension in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease: a secondary analysis of the CLOVERS trial [^114PxNu5]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Sepsis represents a major health care problem worldwide and is associated with a high treatment burden and mortality, contributing to an estimated 20% of all global deaths. Intravenous fluid resuscitation is a cornerstone in the treatment of sepsis-induced hypoperfusion, aiming to increase preload, cardiac output, and oxygen delivery to tissues. In contrast, excess fluid replenishment may lead to volume overload which bears the risk of prolonged ventilation and increased mortality. Current 2021 guidelines from the Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) recommend the administration of 30 mL/kg body weight of intravenous crystalloid fluid within the first three hours of resuscitation with further fluid management being guided by dynamic parameters, such as stroke volume variation, pulse pressure variation, or echocardiography. Fluid management in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) who suffer from sepsis proves particularly challenging because these patients are prone to volume overload due to a dysregulated fluid balance and perturbed circulatory response to vasopressors. Moreover, advanced CKD itself is associated with an increased risk of death in patients with sepsis. Recommendations for fluid management in sepsis are largely based on low-quality evidence, and quality data for the subpopulation of patients with advanced CKD are mostly lacking. While retrospective data hint towards an acceptable fluid tolerance in patients with advanced CKD and sepsis during the fluid resuscitation phase, in-depth prospective data, particularly involving the optimization and stabilization phases of fluid therapy in sepsis, are still missing.

The CLOVERS (Crystalloid Liberal or Vasopressor Early Resuscitation in Sepsis) trial randomized participants with sepsis-induced hypotension to an early restrictive treatment strategy (prioritizing vasopressors and lower intravenous fluid volumes) or liberal fluid treatment strategy (prioritizing higher volumes of intravenous fluids before vasopressor use) and was unable to detect a significant difference in mortality before discharge home by day 90 between the two treatment groups. We hypothesized that patients with advanced CKD (defined as patients with estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] of less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m² or end-stage renal disease [ESRD] on chronic dialysis) and sepsis-induced hypotension might benefit from an early restrictive fluid strategy and aimed to test our hypothesis in a post-hoc analysis of the CLOVERS trial.

### Perioperative management of patients with end-stage renal disease [^114PAgJF]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2017). Low credibility.

End-stage renal disease (ESRD) is associated with significant alterations in cardiovascular function; homeostasis of body fluid, electrolytes, and acid-base equilibrium; bone metabolism, erythropoiesis; and blood coagulation. The prevalence of ESRD is increasing rapidly worldwide, as is the number of patients requiring surgery under general anesthesia. Patients with ESRD have significantly higher risks of perioperative morbidity and mortality due to multiple comorbidities. The perioperative management of patients with ESRD under general anesthesia therefore requires special considerations and a careful multidisciplinary approach. In this review, the authors summarize the available literature to address common issues related to patients with ESRD and discuss the best perioperative approach for this patient subgroup.

### Early fluid management affects short-term mortality in patients with end-stage kidney disease undergoing chronic hemodialysis and requiring continuous renal replacement therapy [^1123x61C]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) is a principal intervention in critically ill patients with acute kidney injury (AKI), following admission to intensive care unit (ICU). Approximately 4% of critically ill patients with AKI require renal replacement therapy and up to 80% of AKI patients undergo CRRT as the treatment modality. Because critical illness at admission to ICU and a great burden of comorbidities contribute to being unable to tolerate the hemodynamic shifts of conventional hemodialysis, CRRT is frequently used also in end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) patients admitted to ICU.

Fluid overload is associated with worsening renal dysfunction, an increased length of ICU stay, and elevated mortality risk. Several studies have demonstrated that an increased cumulative fluid balance is significantly associated with greater mortality risk in critically ill patients with AKI. Therefore, negative fluid balance has been considered a basic approach to improve survival rates in critically ill patients with AKI.

Patients with preexisting ESKD are vulnerable to fluid overload and common causes of death are cardiovascular disease and sepsis, which would require a large volume of intravenous fluid for initial resuscitation management. Consequently, ESKD patients with critical illness would become volume-overloaded, contradicting to current knowledge regarding fluid management in patients with AKI. Therefore, we investigated the association between fluid balance and mortality in patients with ESKD undergoing chronic hemodialysis and requiring CRRT.

### Outcomes of CMS-mandated fluid administration among fluid-overloaded patients with sepsis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113sfvkK]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The outcomes of large-volume IVF administration to septic shock patients with comorbid congestive heart failure (CHF) and/or end-stage renal disease (ESRD) are uncertain and widely debated in the existing literature. Despite this uncertainty, CMS continues to recommend that 30 ml/kg of an intravenous crystalloid solution be administered to patients in septic shock starting within 3 h of presentation. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the relationship between adherence to this guideline and outcomes among patients whose underlying comorbidities present a risk of fluid overload.

Methods

Our search was conducted on PubMed and Scopus through November 5, 2021 to identify studies that evaluated clinical outcomes among septic patients with CHF/ESRD based on volume of fluid administered. The primary outcome measured was mortality at 30 days post-hospital discharge. Other outcomes included the rates of vasopressor requirements, invasive mechanical ventilation during hospitalization, as well as length of stay in the intensive care unit and/or hospital. We used random effects meta-analysis when two or more studies reported the same outcome.

Results

We included five studies in the final meta-analysis, which comprised 5804 patients, 5260 (91%) of whom received non-aggressive fluid resuscitation, as defined by the studies' authors. Random-effects meta-analysis for all-cause mortality showed that aggressive fluid resuscitation was associated with statistically non-significant increased odds of mortality (OR 1.42, 95% CI 0.88–2.3, P = 0.15, I² = 35%). There was no statistical association between volume of IVF administration and other outcomes evaluated.

Conclusion

Among septic shock patients with CHF and/or ESRD, administration of greater than or equal to 30 ml/kg IVF was associated with a non-significant increase in odds of mortality. All other outcomes measured were found to be non-significant, although there was a trend toward better outcomes among patients in the restricted-volume compared to the standard-volume IVF groups. Since this meta-analysis only included five observational studies, more studies are needed to guide an optimal volume and rate of fluid administration in this patient population.

### Clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with end-stage renal disease hospitalized with diabetes ketoacidosis [^114uMRcY]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2020). High credibility.

We suggest a modified approach for fluid replacement in patients with ESRD, preferring a small bolus of 250 mL initially with reassessment after each infusion — particularly if no hypotensive, or just insulin therapy without fluids bolus. Intensive fluid resuscitation during the initial management of DKA usually results in some degree of correction of hyperglycemia due to forced osmotic diuresis. However, hypertonicity in these patients is more a reflection of the degree of hyperglycemia and not due to osmotic diuresis, as previously discussed. It has been proposed that adequate insulin administration alone, with limited or without intravenous fluid resuscitation, may resolve the metabolic disturbances without complications. Current guidelines recommend an insulin infusion with a glucose correction rate of 50–75 mg/dL/hour. Using continuous glucose monitoring on patients with diabetes, Kazempour-Ardebili et al showed lower mean glucose levels by −36 to −190 mg/dL during dialysis days compared with days off dialysis; and Sobngwi et al showed that total daily insulin needs can decrease by ~25% on hemodialysis days. Hence, we suggest a careful and slower rate of hyperglycemia correction, considering the glucose-lowering effect of dialysis and/or potentially avoiding the use of intravenous insulin bolus on starting the insulin infusion, which may decrease the risk of hypoglycemia. However, future studies are needed to determine the best hydration regimen to manage patients with DKA and ESRD to minimize iatrogenic fluid overload.

### Fluid management for sepsis-induced hypotension in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease: a secondary analysis of the CLOVERS trial [^116QQAhF]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Early fluid management in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) and sepsis-induced hypotension is challenging with limited evidence to support treatment recommendations. We aimed to compare an early restrictive versus liberal fluid management for sepsis-induced hypotension in patients with advanced CKD.

Methods

This post-hoc analysis included patients with advanced CKD (eGFR of less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m² or history of end-stage renal disease on chronic dialysis) from the crystalloid liberal or vasopressor early resuscitation in sepsis (CLOVERS) trial. The primary endpoint was death from any cause before discharge home by day 90.

Results

Of 1563 participants enrolled in the CLOVERS trial, 196 participants had advanced CKD (45% on chronic dialysis), with 92 participants randomly assigned to the restrictive treatment group and 104 assigned to the liberal fluid group. Death from any cause before discharge home by day 90 occurred significantly less often in the restrictive fluid group compared with the liberal fluid group (20 [21.7%] vs. 41 [39.4%], HR 0.5, 95% CI 0.29–0.85). Participants in the restrictive fluid group had more vasopressor-free days (19.7 ± 10.4 days vs. 15.4 ± 12.6 days; mean difference 4.3 days, 95% CI, 1.0–7.5) and ventilator-free days by day 28 (21.0 ± 11.8 vs. 16.5 ± 13.6 days; mean difference 4.5 days, 95% CI, 0.9–8.1).

Conclusions

In patients with advanced CKD and sepsis-induced hypotension, an early restrictive fluid strategy, prioritizing vasopressor use, was associated with a lower risk of death from any cause before discharge home by day 90 as compared with an early liberal fluid strategy.

### Dialysis 101. acute and chronic fluid shifts [^114SS44G]. Anesthesiology Clinics of North America (2000). Low credibility.

For over 30 years, dialysis has been accepted as a proven therapeutic intervention in sustaining life for patients with end-stage renal disease. As a renal replacement therapy, dialysis only approximates renal function. Derangements in fluids, electrolytes, and acid-base homeostasis occur in the course of progressive renal insufficiency. Nephrons are able to adapt to physiologic needs and maintain a balance for many solutes, until the very late stages of chronic renal failure. This permits survival of the patient with minimal therapeutic intervention. The availability of highly permeable membranes has allowed development of continuous renal replacement therapies that gradually remove fluids and solutes resulting in better hemodynamic stability.

### Challenges and pitfalls when implementing renal replacement therapy in the ICU [^116SPYfU]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Challenges for RRT in the ICU

Determining goals for therapy

Defining the goals of therapy is a key consideration in the use of RRT in the ICU. Critically ill patients span the spectrum of severity at initial evaluation, and changes in severity of illness occur commonly and predict outcomes. Process of care factors (e.g. fluid resuscitation, ventilator requirements, and nutritional support) further influence patient needs. Consequently, therapeutic modalities need to support organ function through the continuum of critical illness. Unfortunately, there is no consensus on the goals for therapy with RRT in the ICU. In most instances, clinicians consider RRT only as a means to address uremic symptoms or biochemical evidence of solute and fluid imbalance. Life-threatening events such as severe hyperkalemia with electrocardiogram (ECG) changes, marked acid-base abnormalities, and diuretic unresponsive fluid overload or central nervous system manifestations attributed to uremia are common events managed with RRT. As a result, RRT is only offered when there is clear evidence of functional deterioration to a point at which the kidney is unlikely to recover quickly enough to avoid the deleterious consequences of altered renal function. This approach is largely based on experience with ESRD patients where dialysis is only initiated when the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) has declined to < 5–10 ml/minute and the patient is symptomatic. This approach is problematic in ICU patients with acute kidney injury (AKI), because the strategy in treatingis to minimize and avoid uremic complications, whereas inthe aim is to keep the patient off dialysis as long as possible. Thus, it is not necessary to wait for progressive uremia as the only goal for RRT. For instance, excessive volume resuscitation, a common strategy used for multiorgan failure (MOF), may result in fluid accumulation and overload even when kidney function is not completely compromised. In these instances, fluid removal to achieve fluid balance could be considered a therapeutic target for RRT. In fact, given the versatility of RRT techniques to maintain metabolic and fluid balance, RRT should be considered a means to maintain homeostasis.is particularly well suited to provide renal support in thepatient. The freedom to provide continuous fluid management permits the application of unlimited nutrition, adjustments in hemodynamic parameters, and achievement of steady-state solute control — benefits which are difficult to attain with intermittent therapies.

### Clinical factors and outcomes of dialysis-dependent end-stage renal disease patients with emergency department septic shock [^112hj1yn]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Infection is the second leading cause of death in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients. Prior investigations of acute septic shock in this specific population are limited.

Objective

We aimed to evaluate the clinical presentation and factors associated with outcome among ESRD patients with acute septic shock.

Methods

We reviewed patients prospectively enrolled in an emergency department (ED) septic shock treatment pathway registry between January 2014 and May 2016. Clinical and treatment variables for ESRD patients were compared with non-ESRD patients. A second analysis focused on ESRD septic shock survivors and nonsurvivors.

Results

Among 4126 registry enrollees, 3564 (86.4%) met inclusion for the study. End-stage renal disease was present in 3.8% (n = 137) of ED septic shock patients. Hospital mortality was 20.4% and 17.1% for the ESRD and non-ESRD septic shock patient groups (p = 0.31). Septic shock patients with ESRD had a higher burden of chronic illness, but similar admission clinical profiles to non-ESRD patients. End-stage renal disease status was independently associated with lower fluid resuscitation dose, even when controlling for severity of illness. Age and admission lactate were independently associated with mortality in ESRD septic shock patients.

Conclusion

ESRD patients comprise a small but important portion of patients with ED septic shock. Although presentation clinical profiles are similar to patients without ESRD, ESRD status is independently associated with lower fluid dose and compliance with the 30-mL/kg fluid goal. Hyperlactatemia is a marker of mortality in ESRD septic shock.

### Modern tools for optimizing fluid management in dialysis patients: a comprehensive review [^115fjKWG]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of death in patients with ESRD on dialysis. Fluid overload contributes to hypertension, left ventricular hypertrophy, heart failure, and increased mortality in this population. Conversely, excessive ultrafiltration can lead to intradialytic hypotension, myocardial stunning, and a decline in residual renal function. Accurate fluid status assessment and careful ultrafiltration management are crucial for optimal care of patients on dialysis.

Volume overload is an excess of extracellular fluid beyond the body's homeostatic capacity which manifests as increased total body water leading to venous and pulmonary congestion. Traditionally, nephrologists have relied on clinical parameters such as blood pressure, physical examination findings, and changes in body weight to evaluate the patient's volume status. However, these methods have limitations and can often be misleading. Findings such as edema and pulmonary rales have poor sensitivity and specificity for detecting volume overload in dialysis patients. Chest X-ray, another commonly used tool, can only detect pulmonary edema when a significant degree of volume overload is already present. Even the use of dry weight, a fundamental concept in dialysis management, has its limitations. There is a need for more objective ways to assess volume status. This review focuses on emerging techniques that enable direct visualization of organ congestion or objective measurement of fluid status, complementing established methods like relative blood volume monitoring and biomarkers.

### Euvolemia in hemodialysis patients: a potentially dangerous goal? [^1169Gq2Q]. Seminars in Dialysis (2014). Low credibility.

Dialysis patients have high mortality rate and the leading cause of death is cardiovascular disease. Uremic cardiomyopathy differs from that due to conventional atherosclerosis, where cardiovascular changes result in ineffective circulation and lead to tissue ischemia. Modern dialysis has significant limitations with fluid management probably the most challenging. Current evidence suggests that both volume overload and aggressive fluid removal can induce circulatory stress and multi-organ injury. Furthermore, we do not have accurate volume assessment tools. As a result, targeting euvolemia might result in more harm than benefit with conventional hemodialysis therapy. Therefore, it might be time to consider a degree of permissive over-hydration until we have better tools to both determine ideal weight and improve current renal replacement therapy so that the process of achieving it is not so fraught with the current dangers.

### Modern tools for optimizing fluid management in dialysis patients: a comprehensive review [^111MyJPc]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Maintaining optimal fluid balance is crucial for patients with end-stage renal disease on dialysis, as both fluid overload and excess removal can lead to poor outcomes. Traditional approaches such as physical exam and chest X-ray have limitations when assessing volume status. This review carefully examines the tools that provide more precise options, including lung ultrasound, echocardiography, Venous Excess Ultrasound (VEXUS), bioimpedance analysis (BIA), and passive leg raise (PLR). We discuss the principles, supporting evidence, and practical uses of these techniques differentiating between static and dynamic methods to evaluate ultrafiltration tolerance. By integrating these modern techniques with clinical judgment, nephrologists can optimize fluid management in dialysis patients. While these tools show promise, further research is needed to establish standardized protocols and evaluate their impact on patient-centered outcomes.

### Early fluid management affects short-term mortality in patients with end-stage kidney disease undergoing chronic hemodialysis and requiring continuous renal replacement therapy [^1174xQdk]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

ESKD patients admitted to the ICU may have low effective arterial blood volume and hemodynamic instability due to various combinations of sepsis, cardiac dysfunction, and other underlying diseases. Restoration of intravascular volume and circulation may require the administration of large volumes of intravenous fluids. Moreover, fluid overload (e.g. pulmonary edema, respiration failure, and/or third-spacing) may be present on ICU admission in ESKD patients on dialysis who are vulnerable to poor fluid balance. Thus, clinicians have chosen CRRT as a dialysis option to reduce fluid overload and secure hemodynamic stability. However, it remains unclear how to manage volume status by controlling CRRT input and output in these patients. Although a number of literatures have been dealing with this issue, most studies have focused on AKI patients. To our knowledge, the present study is the first attempt to investigate fluid balance in ESKD patients undergoing chronic hemodialysis and requiring CRRT.

Timing of initiation

Early CRRT initiation may not improve outcomes, and the definition of "early" varies between studies. Therefore, clinical judgement guides CRRT initiation. We aim to prevent or rapidly treat life-threatening derangements in fluid status, electrolytes, and/or acid–base balance and to meet metabolic and fluid needs that residual kidney function cannot address.

CONCLUSION

Managing BP and volume in dialysis requires an individualized approach with integration of numerous clinical, dialysis treatment, and patient factors. Bolstered by shared commitments to improving volume management and focusing on patient-stated priorities, the conference participants identified numerous strategies and technologies that should be considered in the design and implementation of future RCTs in this critical, yet understudied area.

### Fluid management for sepsis-induced hypotension in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease: a secondary analysis of the CLOVERS trial [^114MeGvZ]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Fluid resuscitation in the initial hours of sepsis onset (as it was done before randomization for all participants in the CLOVERS trial) appears effective across a wide range of patient subgroups with sepsis, including patients with advanced CKD. However, continued large volume infusion of crystalloid fluid might be harmful and confer a risk of volume overload. The results of our analysis might favor a more restrictive fluid approach following initial fluid resuscitation within the first 24 h in patients with sepsis-induced hypotension and advanced CKD.

Our post-hoc analysis has limitations. Despite demonstrating a significant trend towards a benefit of a fluid restrictive approach in patients with advanced CKD and sepsis-induced hypotension, this analysis has a limited sample size of only 196 participants and should therefore be regarded as hypothesis-generating as the possibility of type 1 error exists. The sample size of the subgroup of patients not receiving dialysis might have been too small to show any significant effect. Further subgroup analyses were not feasible due to the small sample size. Participants in the restrictive fluid group were slightly younger and had a significantly higher body-mass index, which might have affected our results. Mortality in the CLOVERS trial was lower than reported for participants with septic shock in the ICU managed with restrictive or liberal fluid protocols, limiting the generalizability of our results. Our analysis did not distinguish between participants receiving continuous hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. Although the current or imminent decision to withhold most or all life-sustaining treatment was an exclusion criterion in the COVERS trial, data on treatment withdrawal after inclusion in the trial, potentially influencing the primary outcome, was unavailable.

### Management of fluid overload in hemodialysis patients [^11198V47]. Kidney International (2021). Medium credibility.

Fluid overload is a common and important complication encountered in the care of patients with end-stage kidney failure receiving hemodialysis. Fluid overload not only causes unpleasant symptomatology for patients on dialysis, but also leads to increased incidence of hospitalization and mortality. Given the association of fluid overload with adverse outcomes in patients with end-stage kidney failure on hemodialysis, it is paramount that we identify effective and reliable methods to determine fluid status in such patients.

### Early fluid management affects short-term mortality in patients with end-stage kidney disease undergoing chronic hemodialysis and requiring continuous renal replacement therapy [^114VXPxC]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

Notably, cumulative input was suggested to yield survival benefits in our study. In univariate analysis, increases in both cumulative input and output at 3 days were significantly associated with reduced hazard ratios for 7-day mortality (Table 5). In addition, in comparisons of mortality risk, the group with high input and high output tended to have lower 7- and 14-day mortality risks compared to the reference group (i.e. low input/output) (Table 8). These results should be interpreted cautiously given the observational design of our study. As a large amount of fluid was administered for initial resuscitation, it may have seemed as though there was an increase in cumulative input at 3 days, even though the amount of fluid administered was reduced when hemodynamic stability was achieved. Moreover, the surviving patients who tolerated the initial round of resuscitation recovered and ultimately exhibited successful cumulative input/output in the later period. Naturally increased cumulative input may have led to a survival benefit in the analysis. Therefore, rather than unconditionally increasing the input and output, it is necessary to titrate the input according to the patient's needs and ability to tolerate fluid removal, while simultaneously considering the corresponding increase in output.

Our results conflict with the findings of some previous studies. Notably, there were no differences in survival outcome according to fluid management between sepsis and non-sepsis patients. Dialysis patients are particularly susceptible to infections due to uremia-related immune deficiency, defective phagocytic function, old age, comorbidities (e.g. diabetes mellitus), and anatomical abnormalities (e.g. polycystic kidney disease), as well as repetitive exposures to nosocomial microorganisms during the normal course of dialysis therapy. Vascular access for hemodialysis including the dialysis catheter, arteriovenous fistula, and graft increases the risk for infectious complications. ESKD patients undergoing hemodialysis reportedly have higher sepsis-related mortality rates, compared to the general population, despite adjustments for age, ethnicity, and diabetes status. In the present study, however, sepsis was not a predictor for short-term mortality in ESKD patients requiring CRRT. Patients who died within 24 h immediately after CRRT initiation were excluded from the study; thus, the mortality rate from sepsis might have been underestimated. Moreover, ESKD itself is an independent predictor for mortality in patients with sepsis, and therefore the impact of sepsis on mortality might have been masked by the likelihood that patients have concomitant life-threatening conditions (e.g. hyperkalemia and metabolic acidosis).

### Moderate IV fluid resuscitation is associated with decreased sepsis mortality [^1166hQGA]. Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Measures

The primary outcome was hospital mortality. The primary independent variable was the attending fluid group based upon resuscitative IV fluid administered before the end of hospital day-1 (IVFD 1). Secondary outcomes were use of vasopressors, mechanical ventilation, diuretics, and the initiation of new hemodialysis (Table S2).

Statistical Analysis

We performed multivariable linear regression that included an analysis of variance to predict the mean amount of IVFD 1 patients should have received based upon patient characteristics POA. These factors included: patient demographics (age and sex), conditions that trigger IV fluid resuscitation (electrolyte disorders and acute organ dysfunctions), and factors that prompt withholding IV fluid resuscitation (end-stage renal disease, heart failure, chronic bronchitis, and pulmonary hypertension) (Supplemental Methods and Table S3). We then used output from this model to examine the attending physician mean residual (observed–expected) IVFD 1. We assigned the physicians by increasing mean residual IVFD 1 into nine equally sized groups. Following inspection, we reduced the groups to five attending fluid groups to make the difference in IVFD 1 between groups clinically meaningful: very low (11%), low (22%), moderate (33%), high (22%), and very high (11%) (Fig. S2).

For our primary and secondary analyses, we used logistic regression to determine the risk of our outcomes for each attending group adjusted for previously validated patient demographics and the severity of illness POA (Table S2). To create the lower and higher severity patient subgroups, we ordered the patients in ascending risk of predicted hospital mortality and split the cohort equally (Fig. S3). In subgroup analyses, we compared outcomes for patients who did and did not require vasopressors on hospital day-1 as well as for patients with congestive heart failure, end-stage renal disease, and pulmonary hypertension POA. We then compared primary and secondary outcomes between the fluid groups using the Student t test.

To examine whether differences in mortality associated with IVFD 1 were attributed to physician practices within a given hospital or differences between hospitals, we constructed a fixed-effects logistic regression model that included the hospital identification number as well as the patient variables included in our primary analysis. A flowchart outlining the statistical approach is provided (Fig. S4). Databases were constructed in FoxPro (Microsoft Corp, Redmond, WA), all statistical analyses were performed in Data Desk (Data Description, Ithaca, NY).

### Clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with end-stage renal disease hospitalized with diabetes ketoacidosis [^117UAJah]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2020). High credibility.

Discussion

In this study, we analyzed the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients hospitalized with DKA and ESRD on chronic maintenance hemodialysis. We report significant metabolic and clinical outcome differences in patients with DKA and ESRD compared with patients with preserved renal function. The ESRD group presented with twofold higher glucose levels and higher admission potassium concentration compared with those with preserved renal function. We also observed a twofold higher rate of hypoglycemia and a 10-fold higher rate of volume overload, compared with patients with preserved renal function. In addition, patients with ESRD had higher healthcare resource utilization, including longer LOS and hospitalization costs compared with patients with DKA and preserved renal function.

Diabetes is a leading cause of ESRD, with about half of patients requiring dialysis having a diagnosis of diabetes. There is limited high-quality evidence on the management and outcomes of DKA in patients with ESRD. The poor clinical outcome observed in these patients highlights the need for close metabolic monitoring and intensified treatment regimens to prevent the development of DKA, as well as the need for prospective studies to assess personalized management algorithms — including volume replacement and insulin therapy — to improve treatment-related complications and reduce healthcare costs in this high-risk population.

The mainstay of DKA management in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes includes the administration of intravenous fluids, insulin and electrolyte replacement therapy. For patients without cardiac or renal compromise, current guidelines recommend infusing isotonic saline at a rate of 15–20 mL/kg or 1–1.5 L during the first hour, with subsequent rate of 250–500 mL/hour. The higher rates of complications observed in our study suggest that treatment recommendations included in societies' guidelinesmay not be applicable to patients with ESRD. First, we observed higher rates of volume overload suggesting that current recommendations for intravenous fluids resuscitation in DKA guidelines result in higher rates of fluid overload in the dialysis population. The main mechanism for the profound fluid and electrolyte depletion in DKA is osmotic diuresis, which is not present in dialysis patients with ESRD, increasing the risk of volume overload and pulmonary edema. Tzamaloukas et al reported that the degree of hypertonicity and intracellular volume contraction is less profound in patients with ESRD compared with patients with normal renal function at similar hyperglycemia levels.

Results

Baseline characteristics and clinical parameters at CRRT initiation

The baseline characteristics and clinical and laboratory parameters at CRRT initiation are shown in Tables 1 and 2. The mean age of study participants at baseline was 67.9 ± 11.4 years and 71 patients (64.5%) were male. All 110 patients were in the ICU at the time of CRRT initiation, and most (83/110, 75.5%) had sepsis. In total, 35 patients (31.8%) required mechanical ventilation at the time of CRRT initiation and more than half of the patients (52.7%) were prescribed vasopressor treatment due to hemodynamic instability. The overall rate of in-hospital mortality was 41.8% (46/110). Moreover, 69.1% of patients (76/110) survived longer than 14 days; the overall median survival time from CRRT initiation was 7.0 days. Cumulative 7-, 14-, and 28-day mortalities were 21.8%, 30.9%, and 35.5%, respectively.

### Volume management in haemodialysis patients [^111nzBEe]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Accumulating evidence supports the important contribution of volume-related metrics to morbidity and mortality in patients receiving chronic haemodialysis. The purpose of this review is to summarize recent advances in the understanding and management of volume status in this high-risk group.

Recent Findings

Delivery of optimal volume management involves three key components: accurate estimation of volume status, correction of extracellular fluid overload and prevention of intradialytic instability. The lack of a gold standard for assessing volume status makes accurate estimation difficult to achieve; clinical examination has insufficient sensitivity and specificity, while tools to assist in the objective measurement of extracellular fluid volume require further validation. Hypervolemia is common in patients on chronic haemodialysis and substantially increases the risk of morbidity and mortality. Rapid correction of hypervolemia should be avoided due to the risk of precipitating intradialytic hypotension and hypoperfusion of vital end-organs, including the heart, brain, liver, gut and kidneys. Evidence-based interventions to aid in normalizing extracellular fluid volume are urgently needed; several targeted strategies are currently being evaluated. Many centres have successfully implemented local protocols and programmes to enhance volume management.

Summary

Achieving normal volume status is a fundamental goal of haemodialysis. Novel methods of assessing and restoring extracellular fluid volume while maintaining intradialytic stability are currently undergoing evaluation. Implementation of volume-related strategies into clinical practice is feasible and may improve patient outcome.

### Renal association clinical practice guideline on haemodialysis [^114RvxAV]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Guideline 4.1 - Fluid assessment and management in adults

We recommend assessment of fluid status when prompted by clinical circumstances, and on a quarterly basis for stable patients. [1C]

We suggest a multidisciplinary approach to fluid assessment, with patient involvement and the adoption of patient-friendly terminology such as "target weight", "fluid gain" and "over-hydration". [2D]

We suggest supplementing clinical assessment of fluid status with a validated objective measurement, such as bioimpedance, at regular intervals, when clinical assessment is unclear, and following an intercurrent illness. [2C]

We recommend a dialysate temperature not greater than 36'C if standardised. [1C]

We recommend avoiding excessive ultrafiltration rates by addressing fluid gains, accepting staged achievement of target weight, or using an augmented schedule, as necessary. [1B]

We recommend prompt nursing intervention to restore haemodynamic stability in symptomatic / severe intradialytic hypotension, with such interventions leading to clinical review. [1C]

Rationale

Fluid control is an essential clinical goal of maintenance haemodialysis, but correct fluid management requires clinicians to steer between the two competing / overlapping problems of fluid overload and intra-dialytic hypotension.

Failure to control fluid overload may lead to obvious short-term effects including hypertension and breathlessness, and nephrology trainees quickly become familiar with the emergency dialysis admission with pulmonary oedema. In the longer term also, chronic fluid overload is one of the main drivers of hypertension and is independently associated with poor outcomes: for example, in a US study of over 10 000 prevalent haemodialysis patients, Flythe reported clinical outcomes over 2 years' follow-up, according to achievement of target weight during the baseline month. Compared to those achieving within 2kg of target weight on at least 70% of sessions, the 15% of patients frequently remaining over-hydrated post dialysis had increased mortality (HR 1.28, 95%CI 1.15–1.43) as did the 7% of patients who were frequently under-hydrated post dialysis (HR 1.22, 95%CI 1.05–1.40).

### Fluid management for sepsis-induced hypotension in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease: a secondary analysis of the CLOVERS trial [^112m7Zdz]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this post-hoc analysis of participants with advanced CKD and sepsis-induced hypotension, we found that a restrictive fluid strategy (prioritizing vasopressor use) was associated with significantly fewer deaths before discharge home by day 90 compared with a liberal fluid strategy. A restrictive fluid strategy was also associated with a greater number of ventilator-free and vasopressor-free days.

The management of sepsis and septic shock remains challenging, with guidance for optimal fluid therapy being largely based on weak recommendations and low-quality evidence. The difficulty of fluid management in sepsis is due to a complex interplay of inflammation-induced endothelial dysfunction, dysregulated osmotic and hydrostatic pressure, and organ failure leading to impaired fluid distribution between the intravascular, interstitial, and intracellular compartments. The recently published SSC Research Priorities 2023 issued a call to investigate a more refined and individualized approach to fluid resuscitation in sepsis and septic shock. Hence, we seized the opportunity to take a closer look at patients with advanced CKD and sepsis-induced hypotension included in the CLOVERS trial and aimed to determine whether a restrictive fluid strategy was beneficial in this patient population.

In our analysis, the benefit of a restrictive fluid protocol was most evident in the subgroup of patients with advanced CKD on dialysis (HR 0.37, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.81). Assignment to the restrictive study arm in participants with advanced CKD excluding participants requiring dialysis was associated with similar but non-significant trend (HR 0.64, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.33). Arguably, failure to achieve statistical significance in the subgroup of participants who had advanced CKD not receiving dialysis (n = 107) may have been due to the limited sample size. However, the 95% confidence interval ranging from 0.31 to 1.33 does not fully exclude potential harm associated with a restrictive fluid approach in patients with advanced CKD not receiving dialysis. The results of this post-hoc analysis may lead to the assumption that the greater the chronic impairment of kidney function, the more beneficial a restrictive fluid strategy in sepsis-induced hypotension might be. In contrast, no significant difference between fluid strategies was found in participants without advanced CKD.

### Assessment of outcomes in patients with heart failure and end-stage kidney disease after fluid resuscitation for sepsis and septic shock [^1169Qj74]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Sepsis fluid resuscitation is controversial, especially for patients with volume overload risk. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign recommends a 30-mL/kg crystalloid fluid bolus for patients with sepsis-induced hypoperfusion. Criticism of this approach includes excessive fluid resuscitation in certain patients.

Objective

The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of guideline-concordant fluid resuscitation in patients with sepsis and heart failure (HF) or end-stage kidney disease (ESKD).

Methods

A retrospective cohort study was conducted in patients with sepsis who qualified for guideline-directed fluid resuscitation and concomitant HF or ESKD. Those receiving crystalloid fluid boluses of at least 30 mL/kg within 3 h of sepsis diagnosis were placed in the concordant group and all others in the nonconcordant group. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital length of stay (LOS); vasoactive medications and net volume over 24 h; new mechanical ventilation, new or increased volume removal, and acute kidney injury within 48 h; and shock-free survival at 7 days.

Results

One hundred twenty-five patients were included in each group. In-hospital mortality was 34.4% in the concordant group and 44.8% in the nonconcordant group (p = 0.1205). The concordant group had a shorter ICU LOS (7.6 vs. 10.5 days; p = 0.0214) and hospital LOS (12.9 vs. 18.3 days; p = 0.0163), but increased new mechanical ventilation (37.6 vs. 20.8%; p = 0.0052). No differences in other outcomes were observed.

Conclusions

Receipt of a 30-mL/kg fluid bolus did not affect outcomes in a cohort of patients with mixed types of HF and sepsis-induced hypoperfusion.

### Advance care planning with patients who have end-stage kidney disease: a systematic realist review [^116rBgaG]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Patients with end-stage kidney disease have a high disease burden and a mortality rate that exceeds age-matched individuals with cancer and cardiovascular disease. Renal replacement therapy is life-long treatment to replace the normal function of the kidneys with either chronic dialysis (peritoneal dialysis or hemodialysis) or renal transplantation. However, older patients with end-stage kidney disease and additional comorbidities may not achieve improved functional status or live longer on renal replacement therapy. They may be unsuitable for renal transplantation and have complex technical challenges associated with initiating dialysis. Furthermore, some older patients may face the decision of whether or not to even start renal replacement therapy. Those who accept renal replacement therapy often experience a range of distressing psychological and physical symptoms. Despite this, many do not have conversations with loved ones or clinicians about end-of-life issues such as preferences in relation to admission to intensive care, referral to palliative care services, withdrawal from renal replacement therapy, resuscitation, or where they might choose to die. In this context, advance care planning may be a useful intervention to promote shared decision-making among patients, their families, and health care professionals.

### Fluid overload as a therapeutic target for the preservative management of chronic kidney disease [^114A4Lqn]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

There is growing clinical evidence of adverse effects of fluid overload on kidney outcomes in patients with cardiovascular disease who are not yet receiving kidney replacement therapy. In this review, we discuss the patient populations most at risk for fluid overload, the pathophysiology associated with fluid overload, and finally treatment options.

Recent Findings

The severity of fluid overload is an independent risk factor for both an increased risk of rapidly declining kidney function and increased risk for the need of kidney replacement therapy. High venous pressure within the kidney secondarily causes a decrease in kidney perfusion, which in turn signals salt retention and the resulting increase in plasma volume completes a vicious cycle propagating ongoing kidney injury. Fluid overload has also been identified as a risk factor for the combined outcome of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular morbidity. This increased risk in some studies has been identified as more important than hypertension in predicting both the increased risk of kidney disease progression and morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular disease. Once fluid status is accurately assessed, a combination of salt restriction and effective diuretic therapy is the first-line therapy to manage this complication. In those patients who require additional therapy, use of a V2 receptor antagonists can be considered. Finally, some patients may benefit from peritoneal dialysis to bring about volume removal even if they do not yet require dialysis for uremic complications.

Summary

Excess fluid or fluid overload appears to enhance chronic kidney disease progression and its treatment and resolution is a potential disease-modifying intervention.

### Nondialytic management of hyperkalemia and pulmonary edema among end-stage renal disease patients: an evaluation of the evidence [^116Zagv6]. Seminars in Dialysis (2004). Low credibility.

Congestive heart failure (CHF) and hyperkalemia are the two leading reasons for emergency dialysis among individuals with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). While hemodialysis provides definitive treatment of both hyperkalemia and volume overload among ESRD patients, for those who present outside of "regular dialysis hours", institution of dialysis may be delayed. Nondialytic management can be instituted immediately and should be the initial therapy in the management of hyperkalemia and CHF in these individuals. Current available evidence does not allow conclusions as to whether treatment with nondialytic strategies alone results in different outcomes than nondialytic strategies coupled with emergent hemodialysis. Therefore, whether or not nondialytic management alone is appropriate remains a matter of individual judgment that should be decided on a case-by-case basis.

### Effect of an early resuscitation protocol on in-hospital mortality among adults with sepsis and hypotension: a randomized clinical trial [^11462DQo]. JAMA (2017). Excellent credibility.

The study SSSP-2 was published by Ben Andrews and colleagues in 2017 in the journal JAMA. This study is related to the following diseases: Sepsis and septic shock. In the SSSP-2 study, the trial question was: what is the effect of an early resuscitation protocol in adults with sepsis and hypotension in resource-limited settings? In the SSSP-2 study, the study design was: single center, open label, RCT. In the SSSP-2 study, the population was: 209 patients (92 female, 117 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients with sepsis and hypotension presenting to the emergency department in resource-limited settings. The key exclusion criteria were hypoxemia or severe tachypnea; gastrointestinal bleeding in the absence of fever; congestive HF exacerbation; ESRD; elevated jugular venous pressure; incarceration; indications for immediate surgery. In the SSSP-2 study, the interventions were: n = 106 early sepsis protocol (an early aggressive fluid strategy; blood transfusion and titratable dopamine when appropriate) n = 103 usual care (hemodynamic management determined by treating clinicians). In the SSSP-2 study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in death in the hospital (48.1% vs. 33%; RR 1.46, 95% CI 1.04 to 2.05). In the SSSP-2 study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in IV fluid in the 6 hours after presentation (3.5 L vs. 2 L; AD 1.2 L, 95% CI 1 to 1.5) Significant increase in vasopressor use (14.2% vs. 1.9%; AD 12.3%, 95% CI 5.1 to 19.4) Significant increase in death at day 28 (67% vs. 45.3%; RR 1.48, 95% CI 1.14 to 1.91). In the SSSP-2 study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in adverse events. significant difference in length of hospital stay (5 days vs. 7 days). In the SSSP-2 study, the conclusion was: in adult patients with sepsis and hypotension presenting to the emergency department in resource-limited settings, early sepsis protocol was inferior to usual care with respect to death in the hospital.

### Fluid management for sepsis-induced hypotension in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease: a secondary analysis of the CLOVERS trial [^117BjAHx]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Trial procedures

The CLOVERS trial randomly assigned participants in a 1:1 ratio to either a restrictive fluid strategy (with early vasopressor use) or a liberal fluid strategy. The assigned fluid management protocol was followed for 24 h after randomization. The restrictive fluid protocol prioritized vasopressors as the primary treatment for sepsis-induced hypotension, with "rescue fluids" permitted in case of severe intravascular volume depletion. Norepinephrine was suggested as the primary vasopressor. The liberal fluid protocol recommended an initial 1000 mL intravenous bolus infusion of isotonic crystalloids. After clinical reassessment, another 1000 mL of isotonic crystalloid fluid were given in case of persistent volume depletion. Further fluid boluses were based on clinical triggers, such as tachycardia. The conduct of the study was supported by a trial team to improve protocol adherence. After the first 24 h, fluid management was no longer specified.

Outcomes

The primary outcome was death from any cause before discharge home by day 90. Secondary outcomes included 28 day measures of the number of days free from ventilator use, days free from vasopressor use, days out of the ICU, and days out of the hospital. We also assessed the new onset of acute respiratory distress syndrome by day 7 and new intubation by day 28. The days free from renal-replacement therapy were only analyzed in the subset of patients with advanced CKD not previously receiving dialysis. Incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) was compared between the two groups. AKI definitions followed those of the KDIGO (The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) recommendations: AKI stage I was defined as a short-term increase in serum creatinine by at least 0.3 mg/dL or an at least 1.5-fold increase in creatinine levels. AKI stage II and III were defined as a 2- to threefold increase and more than threefold increase in serum creatinine levels, respectively. Calculations were based on the serum creatinine value at randomization and the highest creatinine value within 6 days after randomization.

### Achieving blood pressure targets during dialysis improves control but increases intradialytic hypotension [^115kZcnY]. Kidney International (2008). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular disease remains the most common cause of mortality in patients with end-stage kidney disease treated by regular hemodialysis. To improve blood pressure control and reduce cardiovascular risk, the United Kingdom Renal Association standards committee introduced pre- and post-dialysis target blood pressures of less than 140/90 and 130/80 mm Hg, respectively. We audited blood pressure control and symptomatic intradialytic hypotension requiring fluid resuscitation in the Greater London area renal centers that serve 2630 patients. The study captured 7890 hemodialysis sessions during a 1-week period where only 36% of the patients achieved the pre-dialysis target and 42% the post-dialysis target, with a wide variation between centers. Different antihypertensive medication prescriptions did not affect achievement of these targets. Fifteen percent of the patients suffered symptomatic hypotension requiring fluid resuscitation associated with significantly greater interdialytic weight gains. Our study found that intradialytic hypotension was significantly greater in centers that achieved better post-dialysis blood pressure targeting.

Key End points

Secondary and exploratory end points were tested between the intervention and usual care arms (Table 3; e-Table 3). Fewer patients required RRT (5.1% vs 17.5%; p = 0.04) (Table 3), and fewer patients required mechanical ventilation in the intervention arm compared with the usual care arm (17.7% vs 34.1%; p = 0.04). ICU length of stay was similar in the two arms (2.9 days; intervention arm, 3.3 days [median, 2.09] vs usual care arm, 6.2 days [median, 2.90]; 95% CI, −6.7 to 0.9; p = 0.11). Additionally, among patients who required mechanical ventilation, there was no apparent difference in hours of ventilation (72.4 hour difference; intervention: 47.0 hours [median, 20.47 hours] vs usual care: 119.4 hours [median, 75.60 hours]; 95% CI, −154.1 to 9.2; p = 0.08). Notably, average hours of vasopressors were similar (intervention, 40.7 hours [median, 20.98 hours] vs usual care, 55.6 hours [median, 30.85 hours]; 95% CI, −52.5 to 22.7; p = 0.43) and change in serum creatinine level from baseline to 72 hours was similar (intervention, 0.13 ± 1.10 mg/dL [median, 0.00 mg/dL] vs usual care 0.04 ± 0.97 mg/dL [median, −0.11 mg/dL]). Intervention arm patients received less fluid over 72 hours. This difference in administered fluid remained significant when the preenrollment fluids were included. Intervention patients still exhibited a reduced positive fluid balance at 72 hours when the preenrollment fluids were included. Similar results in fluid balance were seen when patients on dialysis were included or excluded (e-Table 3). Hospital length of stay was comparable (1.2 day difference; intervention: 8.9 ± 8.1 days vs usual care: 10.2 ± 11.1 days; 95% CI, −4.70 to 2.25). More intervention patients were discharged home alive (63.9% compared with 43.9% usual care; 95% CI, 1.6% to 38.3%) (Table 3). There was no difference in overall 30-day mortality rate (6.3% difference intervention: 15.7% vs usual care: 22.0%; 95% CI, −21.2% to 8.6%) (e-Table 3) or 3P-MACE (6.2% difference; intervention: 6.0% vs usual care: 12.2%; 95% CI, −17.4% to 5.1%) (Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5, e-Table 3).

### Pharmacological management of fluid overload [^11172Z4g]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Standard treatment practice for the hypotensive patient with poor tissue perfusion is rapid volume resuscitation; in some scenarios, such as septic shock, this is performed with targeted goal-directed endpoints within 6 h of presentation. As a result, patients often develop significant positive fluid accumulation, which has been associated with poor outcomes above certain thresholds.

Methods

The aim of the current paper is to provide guidance for active pharmacological fluid management in the patient with, or at risk for, clinically significant positive fluid balance from either resuscitation for hypovolaemic shock or acute decompensated heart failure.

Results

We develop rationale for pharmacological fluid management targets (prevention of worsening fluid accumulation, achievement of slow vs rapid net negative fluid balance) in the context of phases of critical illness provided in the earlier Acute Dialysis Quality Initiative 12 papers.

Objectives

Rapid fluid resuscitation has become standard in sepsis care, despite "low-quality" evidence and absence of guidelines for populations "at risk" for volume overload. Our objectives include as follows: 1) identify predictors of reaching a 30mL/kg crystalloid bolus within 3 hours of sepsis onset (30by3); 2) assess the impact of 30by3 and fluid dosing on clinical outcomes; 3) examine differences in perceived "at-risk" volume-sensitive populations, including end-stage renal disease, heart failure, obesity, advanced age, or with documentation of volume "overload" by bedside examination.

Design

Retrospective cohort study. All outcome analyses controlled for sex, end-stage renal disease, heart failure, sepsis severity (severe sepsis vs septic shock), obesity, Mortality in Emergency Department Sepsis score, and time to antibiotics.

Setting

Urban, tertiary care center between January 1, 2014, and May 31, 2017.

Patients

In total, 509 patients received 30by3 (49.3%). Overall mortality was 17.1% (n = 176), with 20.4% mortality in the shock group. Patients who were elderly (odds ratio, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.46–0.83), male (odds ratio, 0.66; CI, 0.49–0.87), obese (odds ratio, 0.18; CI, 0.13–0.25), or with end-stage renal disease (odds ratio, 0.23; CI, 0.13–0.40), heart failure (odds ratio, 0.42; CI, 0.29–0.60), or documented volume "overload" (odds ratio, 0.30; CI, 0.20–0.45) were less likely to achieve 30by3. Failure to meet 30by3 had increased odds of mortality (odds ratio, 1.52; CI, 1.03–2.24), delayed hypotension (odds ratio, 1.42; CI, 1.02–1.99), and increased ICU stay (~2 d) (β = 2.0; CI, 0.5–3.6), without differential effects for "at-risk" groups. Higher fluid volumes administered by 3 hours correlated with decreased mortality, with a plateau effect between 35 and 45mL/kg (p < 0.05).

Conclusions

Failure to reach 30by3 was associated with increased odds of in-hospital mortality, irrespective of comorbidities. Predictors of inadequate resuscitation can be identified, potentially leading to interventions to improve survival. These findings are retrospective and require future validation.

### Fluid management for the prevention and attenuation of acute kidney injury [^1147Cvx6]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2014). Medium credibility.

In patients with acute kidney injury (AKI), optimization of systemic haemodynamics is central to the clinical management. However, considerable debate exists regarding the efficacy, nature, extent and duration of fluid resuscitation, particularly when the patient has undergone major surgery or is in septic shock. Crucially, volume resuscitation might be required to maintain or restore cardiac output. However, resultant fluid accumulation and tissue oedema can substantially contribute to ongoing organ dysfunction and, particularly in patients developing AKI, serious clinical consequences. In this Review, we discuss the conflict between the desire to achieve adequate resuscitation of shock and the need to mitigate the harmful effects of fluid overload. In patients with AKI, limiting and resolving fluid overload might prompt earlier use of renal replacement therapy. However, rapid or early excessive fluid removal with diuretics or extracorporeal therapy might lead to hypovolaemia and recurrent renal injury. Optimal management might involve a period of guided fluid resuscitation, followed by management of an even fluid balance and, finally, an appropriate rate of fluid removal. To obtain best clinical outcomes, serial fluid status assessment and careful definition of cardiovascular and renal targets will be required during fluid resuscitation and removal.

Methods

Study population

We conducted a retrospective review of patients aged 18 years or older who were treated with CRRT due to AKI between 2016 and 2018 in the ICU of Ewha Womans University Mokdong Hospital. A total 330 patients were initially screened. Exclusion criteria included patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on chronic dialysis or those who underwent kidney transplantation, patients who died within 24-h immediately after CRRT initiation, and patients with missing fluid status data. Finally, a total of 258 patients with 24-h assessment of fluid status and 191 patients with 72-h assessment of fluid status were analyzed (Additional file 1: Figure S1). All the enrolled patients received CRRT management for longer than 24-h. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Ewha Womans University, College of Medicine (IRB No. EUMC 2018–11–019). The need for informed consent from patients was waived because of the retrospective study design. All clinical investigations were conducted in accordance with 2013 Declaration of Helsinki guidelines.

Data collection

Baseline characteristics of the enrolled patients were collected at the time of CRRT initiation, including age, sex, body mass index (BMI), cause of AKI, systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), comorbidities (hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, malignancy), Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score, and Glasgow Coma Score (GCS). In addition, the needs for mechanical ventilation and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) were investigated, and the prescriptions for CRRT including target clearance, dialysate flow rate, replacement flow rate, and use of anticoagulation were also assessed. Laboratory data were collected at the initiation of CRRT, and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was calculated using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease equation. The definition of AKI, based on the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes clinical practice guidelines for AKI, was the presence of at least one of the following criteria: (1) an increase in serum creatinine level ≥ 0.3 mg/dL within 48-h, (2) an increase in serum creatinine level to ≥ 1.5 times the baseline level that was known or presumed to have occurred within the previous 7 days, or (3) urine volume < 0.5 mL/kg/h for 6-h.

### Association between volume of fluid resuscitation and intubation in high-risk patients with sepsis, heart failure, end-stage renal disease, and cirrhosis [^112EUM3P]. Chest (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Initial fluid resuscitation volume for sepsis is controversial, particularly in patients at high baseline risk for complications. This study was designed to assess the association between 30 mL/kg crystalloids and intubation in patients with sepsis or septic shock and heart failure, end-stage renal disease, or cirrhosis.

Methods

This propensity score-matched retrospective cohort study included patients with sepsis or septic shock admitted to a large medical ICU. Primary exposure was IV fluid volume in the first 6 h following sepsis diagnosis, divided into two cohorts: ≥ 30 mL/kg (standard group) and < 30 mL/kg (restricted group). The primary outcome was need for mechanical ventilation within 72 h following initiation of fluid resuscitation. Secondary outcomes were length of stay, ventilator days, and time to intubation.

Results

A total of 208 patients were included, with 104 (50%) in the restricted group (< 30 mL/kg) and 104 in the standard group (≥ 30 mL/kg). No difference in intubation incidence was detected between the two groups, with 36 patients (35%) in the restricted group and 33 (32%) in the standard group (adjusted OR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.41–1.36; p = 0.34) intubated. There was no difference between standard and restricted groups in alive ICU-free days (17 ± 11 days vs 17 ± 10 days; p = 0.64), duration of mechanical ventilation (10 ± 12 days vs 11 ± 16 days; p = 0.96), or hours to intubation (16 ± 19 h vs 14 ± 15; p = 0.55).

Conclusions

No differences were detected in the incidence of intubation in patients with sepsis and cirrhosis, end-stage renal disease, or heart failure who received guideline-recommended fluid resuscitation with 30 mL/kg compared with patients initially resuscitated with a lower fluid volume.

### Finding the four-leaf CLOVERS: biologic subphenotypes and fluid tolerance in sepsis [^115fp2Dw]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Fluid resuscitation in sepsis has followed an evolving paradigm. Early strategies, such as the early goal-directed therapy protocol, emphasized intravenous volume loading to meet targets for physiologic measures such as central venous pressure — the idea being to "fill the tank". Over time, this approach gave way to more dynamic assessments of fluid responsiveness ("Will this patient improve their cardiac output if given a fluid bolus?"). Although this lens improved precision, it often overlooked a crucial counterpoint — fluid-related harm. Increasingly, clinicians recognize that beyond responsiveness lies fluid tolerance ("Can this patient safely handle additional fluid, or will it worsen edema and organ dysfunction?).

This shifting paradigm is the backdrop to a timely secondary analysis of the Crystalloid Liberal or Vasopressors Early Resuscitation in Sepsis (CLOVERS) trial by Kiernan and colleagues (pp.) in this issue of the Journal. The original CLOVERS trial, a multicenter randomized study comparing liberal and restrictive fluid strategies for early sepsis resuscitation, showed no significant difference in outcomes. This neutral result seemed to affirm the current consensus that neither strategy offers a clear advantage across the general sepsis population. Furthermore, no differences in outcome were observed across clinically observable subgroups, such as patients with chronic heart failure or end-stage renal disease. However, Kiernan and colleagues challenge this conclusion by revealing a deeper layer of biological heterogeneity.

Using a previously validated parsimonious three-biomarker model (angiopoietin-1, angiopoietin-2, and soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor-1), the investigators stratified 1,200 CLOVERS participants with available plasma samples into two distinct biologic subphenotypes, SP1 and SP2, which differed not only in baseline prognosis but also in response to fluid resuscitation strategy. SP2 patients — characterized by elevated endothelial injury and inflammation — experienced higher mortality with liberal versus restrictive fluids (41% vs. 27%). In contrast, SP1 patients showed no difference (Figure 1). These findings recast our understanding of fluid-related harm. Rather than finding that fluids were uniformly helpful or harmful, the investigators found that certain patients are biologically predisposed to adverse outcomes from aggressive fluid administration. In SP2, liberal fluids may exacerbate endothelial dysfunction, promoting vascular leak, tissue edema, and organ failure. SP1 patients appear more fluid tolerant, experiencing hemodynamic benefit without excess harm. This nuanced insight supports a precision-medicine approach to sepsis resuscitation — tailoring fluid strategy to biology, not relying solely on protocolized thresholds.

### Acute renal failure-definition, outcome measures, animal models, fluid therapy and information technology needs: the second international consensus conference of the acute dialysis quality initiative (ADQI) group [^116aaTKb]. Critical Care (2004). Low credibility.

Introduction

There is no consensus definition of acute renal failure (ARF) in critically ill patients. More than 30 different definitions have been used in the literature, creating much confusion and making comparisons difficult. Similarly, strong debate exists on the validity and clinical relevance of animal models of ARF; on choices of fluid management and of end-points for trials of new interventions in this field; and on how information technology can be used to assist this process. Accordingly, we sought to review the available evidence, make recommendations and delineate key questions for future studies.

Methods

We undertook a systematic review of the literature using Medline and PubMed searches. We determined a list of key questions and convened a 2-day consensus conference to develop summary statements via a series of alternating breakout and plenary sessions. In these sessions, we identified supporting evidence and generated recommendations and/or directions for future research.

Results

We found sufficient consensus on 47 questions to allow the development of recommendations. Importantly, we were able to develop a consensus definition for ARF. In some cases it was also possible to issue useful consensus recommendations for future investigations. We present a summary of the findings. (Full versions of the six workgroups' findings are available on the internet at http://www. ADQI.net)

Conclusion

Despite limited data, broad areas of consensus exist for the physiological and clinical principles needed to guide the development of consensus recommendations for defining ARF, selection of animal models, methods of monitoring fluid therapy, choice of physiological and clinical end-points for trials, and the possible role of information technology.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2012 KDIGO clinical practice guideline for acute kidney injury [^116NuG3K]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2013). Medium credibility.

Implications within US health care — intravenous fluid selection for resuscitation: In the United States, starch-containing intravenous fluids should be avoided. The use of albumin for resuscitation should be limited to specific situations in which it is clear that albumin is of benefit, given the increased costs of these solutions compared to crystalloid and the intermittent nationwide shortages of these solutions. Recent studies have suggested that there may be harm with hyperchloremic intravenous solutions (eg, isotonic saline), but this needs to be further tested prior to the widespread use of balanced electrolyte solutions with lower chloride content (eg, Plasma-Lyte, Hartmann's and lactated Ringer's) in the United States.

### Hydroxyethyl starch (HES) versus other fluid therapies: effects on kidney function [^111bQ9oL]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Hydroxyethyl starches (HES) are synthetic colloids commonly used for fluid resuscitation to replace intravascular volume, yet they have been increasingly associated with adverse effects on kidney function. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2010.

Objectives

To examine the effects of HES on kidney function compared to other fluid resuscitation therapies in different patient populations.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Renal Group's specialised register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, in The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, EMBASE, MetaRegister and reference lists of articles. The most recent search was completed on November 19, 2012.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs in which HES was compared to an alternate fluid therapy for the prevention or treatment of effective intravascular volume depletion. Primary outcomes were renal replacement therapy (RRT), author-defined kidney failure and acute kidney injury (AKI) as defined by the RIFLE criteria.

Data Collection and Analysis

Screening, selection, data extraction and quality assessments for each retrieved article were carried out by two authors using standardised forms. All outcomes were analysed using relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Authors were contacted when published data were incomplete. Preplanned sensitivity and subgroup analyses were performed after data were analysed with a random-effects model.

Main Results

This review included 42 studies (11,399 patients) including 19 studies from the original review (2010), as well as 23 new studies. Fifteen studies were excluded from the original review (nine retracted from publication due to concerns about integrity of data and six lacking individual patient creatinine data for the calculation of RIFLE criteria). Overall, there was a significant increase in the need for RRT in the HES treated individuals compared to individuals treated with other fluid therapies (RR 1.31, 95% CI 1.16 to 1.49; 19 studies, 9857 patients) and the number with author-defined kidney failure (RR 1.59, 95% CI 1.26 to 2.00; 15 studies, 1361 patients). The RR of AKI based on RIFLE-F (failure) criteria also showed an increased risk of AKI in individuals treated with HES products (RR 1.14, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.30; 15 studies, 8402 participants). The risk of meeting urine output and creatinine based RIFLE-R (risk) criteria for AKI was in contrast in favour of HES therapies (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.91 to 0.99; 20 studies, 8769 patients). However, when RIFLE-R urine output based outcomes were excluded as per study protocol, the direction of AKI risk again favoured the other fluid type, with a non-significant RR of AKI in HES treated patients (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.14; 8445 patients). A more robust effect was seen for the RIFLE-I (injury) outcome, with a RR of AKI of 1.22 (95% CI 1.08 to 1.37; 8338 patients). No differences between subgroups for the RRT and RIFLE-F based outcomes were seen between sepsis versus non-sepsis patients, high molecular weight (MW) and degree of substitution (DS) versus low MW and DS (≥ 200 kDa and > 0.4 DS versus 130 kDa and 0.4 DS) HES solutions, or high versus low dose treatments (i.e. ≥ 2 L versus < 2 L). There were differences identified between sepsis versus non-sepsis subgroups for the RIFLE-R and RIFLE-I based outcomes only, which may reflect the differing renal response to fluid resuscitation in pre-renal versus sepsis-associated AKI. Overall, methodological quality of the studies was good.

Authors' Conclusions

The current evidence suggests that all HES products increase the risk in AKI and RRT in all patient populations and a safe volume of any HES solution has yet to be determined. In most clinical situations it is likely that these risks outweigh any benefits, and alternate volume replacement therapies should be used in place of HES products.

### Should chloride-rich crystalloids remain the mainstay of fluid resuscitation to prevent' pre-renal'acute kidney injury? con [^112bof9H]. Kidney International (2014). Low credibility.

Nevertheless, on the basis of current literature there is adequate evidence to suggest that balanced crystalloids are more physiological than 0.9% saline and cause less detriment to renal function, with perhaps better clinical outcome. Hence, we submit that we have presented a coherent argument to recommend that chloride-rich crystalloids such as 0.9% saline should be replaced with balanced crystalloids as the mainstays of fluid resuscitation to prevent 'pre-renal' acute kidney injury.

### Updates in management and timing of dialysis in acute kidney injury [^117GPzrU]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common complication in hospitalized patients and is associated with mortality, prolonged hospital length of stay, and increased healthcare costs. This paper reviews several areas of controversy in the identification and management of AKI. Serum creatinine and urine output are used to identify and stage AKI by severity. Although standardized definitions of AKI are used in research settings, these definitions do not account for individual patient factors or clinical context which are necessary components in the assessment of AKI. After treatment of reversible causes of AKI, patients with AKI should receive adequate volume resuscitation with crystalloid solutions. Balanced crystalloid solutions generally prevent severe hyperchloremia and could potentially reduce the risk of AKI, but additional studies are needed to demonstrate a clinical benefit. Intravenous albumin may be beneficial in patients with chronic liver disease either to prevent or attenuate the severity of AKI; otherwise, the use of albumin or other colloids (eg, hydroxyethyl starch) is not recommended. Diuretics should be used to treat volume overload, but they do not facilitate AKI recovery or reduce mortality. Nutrition consultation may be helpful to ensure that patients receive adequate, but not excessive, dietary protein intake, as the latter can lead to azotemia and electrolyte disturbances disproportionate to the patient's kidney failure. The optimal timing of dialysis initiation in AKI remains controversial, with conflicting results from two randomized controlled trials.

### Association between intravenous chloride load during resuscitation and in-hospital mortality among patients with SIRS [^1142gt3F]. Intensive Care Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Methods

Design and patients

This study retrospectively analysed prospectively collected US inpatient data between 1 January 2009 and 31 March 2013, sourced from the HealthFacts ® (Cerner Corp. Kansas City, MO) EHR database and was approved by the Duke University IRB. Inclusion criteria (Supplementary Fig. 1) were prospectively defined to identify hypovolaemic patients requiring fluid resuscitation, and included age ≥ 18 years; presence of SIRS criteria (tachycardia [HR > 90 bpm] plus any of the following: (1) temperature > 38 or < 36 °C; (2) ≥ 20 breaths/min or PaCO₂ ≤ 32 mmHg; (3) leukocytes ≥ 12,000 or ≤ 4,000 cells/mm³); receipt of > 500 mL crystalloid resuscitation solution within 2 days of SIRS qualification (≥ 2 administrations > 250 mL); and hospitalization ≥ 24 h. Tachycardia was required for inclusion because it is readily captured in the database and can be used as a clinical marker for hypovolaemia. Crystalloid resuscitation solutions included 0.9% saline, Ringer's lactate and other balanced crystalloids. Dextrose-containing solutions (e.g. 5% dextrose in water) were also included in total fluid volume, but were considered maintenance fluids and did not count toward resuscitation volume inclusion requirements. Patients receiving any fluid containing hydroxyl-ethyl starch or albumin, plasma protein fraction (PPF), hypertonic saline or 0.45% saline, or receiving > 1 L total fluid on the day preceding SIRS qualification were excluded. Gelatins (Gelofusine ®, Haemaccel ®) are unavailable in the United States, and were not specified as exclusion criteria. Patients undergoing cardiac procedures (Supplementary Table 1) were excluded, as were patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD; ICD-9 585.6), since large-volume resuscitation is infrequently used for patients with ESRD.

Data source

HealthFacts ® is a de-identified, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)-compliant, US EHR database covering 486 clinical facilities and hospital systems. The study dataset was extracted from the database such that duplicates and entries with missing/incomplete data were removed. Care was taken to avoid multiple counts of patient encounters, such that the dataset represents individual patients.

### Renal replacement therapy in acute kidney injury: controversy and consensus [^116hZnbz]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Pre- or post-dilution

Hemofiltration (HF) is a process that parallels what occurs in the human glomerulus. The tubular function is mimicked by fluid reinfusion to compensate, in total or in part, for the amount of filtered fluid. Reinfusion guarantees restoration of hematocrit to previous values and ensures solute dilution in the blood. Reinfusion can be performed before (pre-dilution) or after (post-dilution) the filter. Pre-dilution HF is less efficient because the filtrate contains fewer solutes since the blood will have been diluted before entering the filter. Nevertheless, the lower hemoconcentration inside the filter reduces the risk of clotting. Post-dilution is the best way to estimate creatinine/urea clearance in HF because clearance equals effluent rate. In post-dilution HF, the phenomenon of concentration polarization may induce membrane fouling and filter clotting. If pre-dilution HF is selected, protein layer deposition is reduced, but the efficiency of the treatment is reduced and the dose is not linearly proportional to the effluent rate. Clearance is calculated by the effluent rate corrected for the dilution factor. No clinical study has definitively addressed when pre- or post-dilution HF should be used, so this decision is largely a matter of local experience and preference.

Ultrafiltration

Fluid overload is associated with adverse outcomes in critical illness and often represents a primary indication for RRT. Capillary leak and hypoalbuminemia predispose patients to the accumulation of interstitial edema and slow intravascular refilling. After initial resuscitation, it is crucial to avoid unnecessary fluid accumulation to limit later requirements for fluid removal. Patients should be actively assessed for the presence of fluid overload, and the rate and final target of fluid removal must be carefully considered and frequently reassessed, whichever method is used to achieve this. Setting the rate of removal requires consideration of the severity of complications of fluid overload, anticipated fluid intake, expected rate of vascular refilling, and cardiovascular tolerance to transient reduction in intravascular volume due to ultrafiltration. Techniques such as bioimpedance analysis and relative blood volume monitoring may assist in setting targets for total volume and rate of fluid removal, although these techniques have not been widely applied in the intensive care unit (ICU). Of note, although many tools can be used to predict the response to fluid administration (such as pulse pressure variations or passive leg-raising), there are no good indicators to predict tolerance to fluid removal. A fluid removal trial (reverse fluid challenge) is therefore often the only option while assessing cardiovascular tolerance with the available hemodynamic tools.

### Moderate IV fluid resuscitation is associated with decreased sepsis mortality [^111qD8Sh]. Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

We examined physician and hospital IV fluid resuscitation practices for patients with sepsis and septic shock using the Premier Healthcare Database. We found that while baseline patient characteristics predict that patients with sepsis should receive a relatively narrow range of mean IV fluids on day-1 (95% range, 3.6–4.5 L), in practice they received a much wider range (95% range, 1.7–7.4 L). Our findings indicate that being treated by a physician who on average administers a moderate amount of IVFD 1 (4.0 L; IQR, 2.4–5.1 L) is associated with decreased mortality. Moderate IVFD 1 is also associated with decreased rates of mechanical ventilation, vasopressor use, and new hemodialysis. Contrary to current recommendations to initiate vasopressors early and the common practice of using early vasopressors to reduce resuscitation volumes, we did not observe increased utilization of vasopressors in the lower fluid groups despite increased mortality rates. This may reflect a component of clinical mismanagement as physicians who intentionally adopt a low fluid resuscitation strategy typically supplement fluid with vasopressors to achieve mean arterial pressure resuscitation targets. In a subgroup analysis of patients with baseline heart failure, end-stage renal disease, and pulmonary hypertension, resuscitation with a median of 2–3 L of IVFD 1 is associated with reduced mortality compared with lower or higher IVFD 1. This is consistent with prior work, which demonstrated septic patients with preexisting heart and renal failure experienced reduced mortality following implementation of a sepsis bundle that mandated a bolus of 30 mL/kg compared with lower volumes of IVFD 1. Finally, an analysis that accounted for within- and between-hospital differences found that most of the observed variation in IVFD 1 is attributed to within-hospital physician variation. Physician behavior, independent of patient characteristics that might either trigger IV fluid resuscitation or prompt withholding of IV fluid, accounts for the majority of variation in IVFD 1 practices observed between fluid groups.

### Mechanisms for hemodynamic instability related to renal replacement therapy: a narrative review [^112aD91Y]. Intensive Care Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Hemodynamic instability related to renal replacement therapy (HIRRT) is a frequent complication of all renal replacement therapy (RRT) modalities commonly used in the intensive care unit. HIRRT is associated with increased mortality and may impair kidney recovery. Our current understanding of the physiologic basis for HIRRT comes primarily from studies of end-stage kidney disease patients on maintenance hemodialysis in whom HIRRT is referred to as 'intradialytic hypotension'. Nonetheless, there are many studies that provide additional insights into the underlying mechanisms for HIRRT specifically in critically ill patients. In particular, recent evidence challenges the notion that HIRRT is almost entirely related to excessive ultrafiltration. Although excessive ultrafiltration is a key mechanism, multiple other RRT-related mechanisms may precipitate HIRRT and this could have implications for how HIRRT should be managed (e.g., the appropriate response might not always be to reduce ultrafiltration, particularly in the context of significant fluid overload). This review briefly summarizes the incidence and adverse effects of HIRRT and reviews what is currently known regarding the mechanisms underpinning it. This includes consideration of the evidence that exists for various RRT-related interventions to prevent or limit HIRRT. An enhanced understanding of the mechanisms that underlie HIRRT, beyond just excessive ultrafiltration, may lead to more effective RRT-related interventions to mitigate its occurrence and consequences.

### Acute kidney injury: a guide to diagnosis and management [^117E4SRg]. American Family Physician (2012). Low credibility.

Acute kidney injury is characterized by abrupt deterioration in kidney function, manifested by an increase in serum creatinine level with or without reduced urine output. The spectrum of injury ranges from mild to advanced, sometimes requiring renal replacement therapy. The diagnostic evaluation can be used to classify acute kidney injury as prerenal, intrinsic renal, or postrenal. The initial workup includes a patient history to identify the use of nephrotoxic medications or systemic illnesses that might cause poor renal perfusion or directly impair renal function. Physical examination should assess intravascular volume status and identify skin rashes indicative of systemic illness. The initial laboratory evaluation should include measurement of serum creatinine level, complete blood count, urinalysis, and fractional excretion of sodium. Ultrasonography of the kidneys should be performed in most patients, particularly in older men, to rule out obstruction. Management of acute kidney injury involves fluid resuscitation, avoidance of nephrotoxic medications and contrast media exposure, and correction of electrolyte imbalances. Renal replacement therapy (dialysis) is indicated for refractory hyperkalemia; volume overload; intractable acidosis; uremic encephalopathy, pericarditis, or pleuritis; and removal of certain toxins. Recognition of risk factors (e.g., older age, sepsis, hypovolemia/shock, cardiac surgery, infusion of contrast agents, diabetes mellitus, preexisting chronic kidney disease, cardiac failure, liver failure) is important. Team-based approaches for prevention, early diagnosis, and aggressive management are critical for improving outcomes.

Unlike the above studies, our trial implemented a fluid management protocol after initial resuscitation, once hemodynamics was stable. Both groups received approximately 4.5 L of fluid prior to randomization. Then, this protocol optimized fluid administration, minimized inadvertent fluid, and employed active de-resuscitation using diuretics and RRT if needed. We specifically targeted a neutral to negative fluid balance after initial fluid resuscitation, which should be tailored to each patient's baseline characteristics, comorbidities, illness severity, prior fluid administration, and diagnosis. At randomization, participants had received an average intravenous fluid volume exceeding 30 mL/kg, aligning with the CLASSIC and CLOVERS trials and with Surviving Sepsis Guidelines for adequate initial fluid resuscitation. The total fluid balance during our study was higher than in some prior trials. A retrospective analysis by Murphy et al. suggested that administering more than 20 mL/kg of intravenous fluids and achieving a central venous pressure higher than 8 mmHg might reduce hospital mortality. This approach should be followed by conservative late fluid management, aiming for at least 2 consecutive days of neutral or negative fluid balance in the first week after sepsis onset.

Our study reached a neutral or negative fluid balance despite similar diuretic doses between groups. Adequate initial fluid resuscitation may enhance early tissue perfusion, while subsequent fluid restriction likely prevents renal congestion and improves kidney function. Consequently, diuretic requirements to increase urine output may be lower.

We observed potential clinical benefits associated with a restrictive fluid strategy, including a shorter duration of mechanical ventilation, more ventilator-free days and vasopressor-free days and reduced ICU and hospital stays. A secondary analysis of the CLOVER trial showed that in patient with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and sepsis-induced hypotension, an early restrictive fluid management was associated with longer ventilator-free and vasopressor-free days. Similarly, Previous comparisons of liberal and conservative fluid strategies in acute lung injury patients showed that conservative fluid management improved ventilator-free days, organ-failure‒free days, and ICU-free days. One possible mechanism is that minimizing fluid overload may enhance vasopressor responsiveness and preserve organ function. However, a subgroup analysis in the RADAR-2 study found that active de-resuscitation within 24–48 h of ICU admission could increase mortality risk in mechanically ventilated patients with sepsis. These findings highlight the need to individualize active de-resuscitation.

### Volume management in continuous renal replacement therapy [^113eN7NN]. Seminars in Dialysis (2009). Low credibility.

Volume management is an integral component of the care of critically ill patients to maintain hemodynamic stability and optimize organ function. The dynamic nature of critical illness often necessitates volume resuscitation and contributes to fluid overload particularly in the presence of altered renal function. Diuretics are commonly used as an initial therapy to increase urine output; however they have limited effectiveness due to underlying acute kidney injury and other factors contributing to diuretic resistance. Continuous renal replacement techniques (CRRT) are often required for volume management. In this setting, successful volume management depends on an accurate assessment of fluid status, an adequate comprehension of the principles of fluid management with ultrafiltration, and clear treatment goals. Complications related to excessive ultrafiltration can occur and have serious consequences. A careful monitoring of fluid balance is therefore essential for all patients. This review provides an overview of the appropriate assessment and management of volume status in critically ill patients and its management with CRRT to optimize organ function and prevent complications of fluid overload.

Prevention and treatment of AKI — KDOQI aligns with key KDIGO recommendations and fluid choices: the section includes 7 level 1 recommendations and 22 level 2 recommendations, and our KDOQI Work Group agreed with the 7 level 1 recommendations; the Work Group agreed with using isotonic crystalloids rather than colloids for volume expansion in patients at risk of AKI or with AKI and noted harm with starch-containing colloids, therefore these solutions should be avoided; albumin resuscitation has been associated with harm in traumatic brain injury and should be avoided in that setting; in liver disease, intravenous albumin appears to be beneficial for prevention of renal failure and death in spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and for prevention of renal failure in large-volume paracentesis; diagnostic criteria for hepatorenal syndrome include lack of improvement after volume expansion with albumin (1 g/kg/d up to 100 g/d) for at least 2 days and withdrawal of diuretic therapy; avoidance of nephrotoxins is not always possible given pathogen resistance examples.

### Timing of renal replacement therapy and long-term risk of chronic kidney disease and death in intensive care patients with acute kidney injury [^115uncWc]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

Using data collected from high-quality clinical and administrative registries, we found no clear evidence that early initiation of RRT in ICU patients was associated with improved long-term clinical outcomes. Early initiation of RRT was not associated with decreased long-term risk of CKD or ESRD. Early initiation was associated with increased short-term mortality but not with long-term mortality. Despite the use of advanced methods, we cannot rule out the influence of residual confounding.

Existing studies

Until recently, existing studies on timing of RRT in ICU patients with AKI were mainly observational, with few RCTs conducted. Researchers in observational studies have used a wide array of parameters to define timing, such as blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, urine output, fluid overload, traditional indications for RRT (e.g. hyperkalemia), time from ICU admission, time from AKI diagnosis, and according to the RIFLE (risk, injury, failure, loss, end-stage renal disease) criteria. The results derived from these observational studies on short-term mortality are conflicting, but after pooling the results of both observational and RCTs, meta-analyses in general favor early RRT initiation. However, because of the heterogeneity in definitions of early and late RRT and the methodological limitations of included studies, the results should be interpreted with caution. Wierstra et al. found that low-quality studies (mainly observational studies) favored early initiation (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.34–0.65; early compared with late); however, in high-quality studies (mainly RCTs), early RRT did not statistically significantly reduce mortality (OR 0.67, 95% CI 0.38–1.15).

Management of AKI in patients with cirrhosis

What strategies are applicable to the management of AKI in patients with cirrhosis?

Consensus statements

We recommend personalised strategies for the management of AKI based on the individual patient's kidney-liver health profile and AKI phenotype (best practice statement).
We recommend a combination of physical examination, imaging studies, and static and dynamic measurements to guide fluid management, with frequent reassessment throughout all phases of treatment to avoid volume overload (best practice statement).
We recommend crystalloids, preferentially balanced solutions, as first-line therapy for patients with AKI requiring fluid resuscitation, unless a specific indication exists for the use of other fluids (strong recommendation, grade B).
We recommend discontinuation of all fluids and initiation of diuretic therapy or RRT in patients with AKI who demonstrate signs or symptoms of volume overload (best practice statement).
There is insufficient evidence to support routine measurement of intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) in patients with tense ascites and AKI (not graded).
We recommend initiation of RRT be individualised, with consideration of clinical context and anticipated or observed life-threatening AKI-related complications (best practice statement).
We recommend expedited evaluation for LT in patients with decompensated cirrhosis following an episode of AKI (best practice statement).
There is insufficient evidence to recommend TIPS or extracorporeal liver support for the treatment of AKI (not graded).

Rationale:

Initial management of patients with AKI should follow KDIGO consensus recommendations for AKI, as well as specific guidelines for patients with cirrhosis, which include discontinuation and/or avoidance of nephrotoxins, and optimisation of haemodynamic and volume status. – Fluid administration requires careful titration based on severity of kidney disease, degree of oliguria, and phase of resuscitation. – Assessment of fluid responsiveness should include careful history and physical examination, vital signs, and a combination of available variables including imaging studies, as well as static and dynamic measurements. – No study has demonstrated superiority of a particular method, and therefore the choice of tool depends on the patient's location (ICU vs. general ward) and clinical discretion. Repeated assessment of volume status and close monitoring of UO should be undertaken so that complications of iatrogenic volume overload can be prevented.

It has been clearly established that critically ill patients with sepsis require prompt fluid resuscitation. The optimal amount of fluid and when to taper this resuscitation is less clear. There is a growing evidence that fluid overload leads to acute kidney injury, and increased morbidity and mortality. A clinician's best intentions in resuscitating a patient can lead to too much of a good thing. Currently, there are several bedside tools to aid in determining a patient's response to a fluid challenge as well as in the assessment of the current volume status. Guidelines are not available on the exact rate of fluid overload removal and what medicinal or mechanical modality is most favorable. We discuss our experience and an examination of the literature on the problems with fluid overload, and how a patient may benefit from forced fluid removal.

### Fluid removal associates with better outcomes in critically ill patients receiving continuous renal replacement therapy: a cohort study [^111pZ3cZ]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In critically ill patients, haemodynamic stabilisation often involves aggressive fluid resuscitation and vasopressor support. Although considered to be crucial for optimisation, this approach tends to lead to fluid accumulation. Evidence is accumulating that fluid overload is associated with harm, including worsening organ dysfunction and mortality. Patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) are particularly at risk. For instance, in patients with early AKI, fluid overload increases the risk of worsening AKI. In patients treated with renal replacement therapy (RRT), fluid overload on the first day of RRT correlates with mortality, dialysis dependency and reduced renal recovery. However, most studies which demonstrate a relationship between fluid accumulation and mortality are confounded by the fact that patients with fluid overload tend to be sicker and often need more organ support.

In general, strategies for avoiding and managing fluid overload include conservative fluid management, diuretic use and mechanical fluid removal. A sub-analysis of the Randomized Evaluation of Normal versus Augmented Level of Renal Replacement Therapy (RENAL) study showed that achieving a negative fluid balance during continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) was associated with a survival benefit. However, the optimal timing and best method of removing fluid and reversing fluid overload during RRT are unknown. As a result, clinical practice is variable. Slower removal rates may result in prolonged exposure to the effects of fluid accumulation, including tissue oedema and progressive organ dysfunction. Murugan et al. analysed critically ill patients with AKI and 5% fluid overload receiving RRT and showed that an ultrafiltration intensity > 25 ml/kg/day was associated with lower 1-year mortality compared to 20 ml/kg/day. More intensive ultrafiltration, however, may not be tolerated and may be associated with an increased risk of haemodynamic instability and organ dysfunction. For instance, the RENAL study showed that net ultrafiltration rates greater than 1.75 ml/kg/h compared with rates less than 1.01 ml/kg/h were associated with a reduced chance of survival. Hypophosphatemia and cardiac arrhythmias were more common in patients exposed to higher ultrafiltration rates.

To reconcile the conflicting messages about ultrafiltration rates, it is important to consider whether the net effect on cumulative fluid balance may be more important than the actual ultrafiltration rate per sé. In addition, there is a need to identify factors which impact the chances of successful fluid removal.

The objectives of our study were to investigate the association between changes in cumulative fluid balance (FB) and mortality during CRRT and to identify relevant clinical parameters which impacted the likelihood of successful decrease of FB.

### Management of acute kidney injury: core curriculum 2018 [^1174XRkG]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a heterogeneous disorder that is common in hospitalized patients and associated with short- and long-term morbidity and mortality. When AKI is present, prompt workup of the underlying cause should be pursued, with specific attention to reversible causes. Measures to prevent AKI include optimization of volume status and avoidance of nephrotoxic medications. Crystalloids are preferred over colloids for most patients, and hydroxyethyl starches should be avoided. Volume overload in the setting of AKI is associated with adverse outcomes, so attention should be paid to overall fluid balance. Currently there are no targeted pharmacotherapies approved for the treatment of AKI. The optimal timing of renal replacement therapy in critically ill patients with AKI is unclear, but is an area of active investigation. Recent studies suggest that AKI is not a "self-limited" process, but is strongly linked to increased risk for chronic kidney disease, subsequent AKI, and future mortality.

### Moderate IV fluid resuscitation is associated with decreased sepsis mortality [^116eLbCU]. Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Sepsis Mortality and Secondary Outcomes

Patients who received care from physicians in the moderate fluid group experienced a reduced adjusted mortality compared with all other fluid groups: –2.5% vs. very low, –1.4% vs. low, –0.5% vs. high, and –2.5% vs. very high (p < 0.01 vs. very low, low, and very high; p = 0.06 vs. high). These observed differences in mortality persisted, but were smaller for the lower severity and sepsis without day-1 vasopressors subgroups, and were larger for those in the higher severity and sepsis with day-1 vasopressors (Table 2; and Table S6 and Figs. S5 and S6). Analyses that examined risk-adjusted mortality each day (days 1–8) showed that the mortality benefit associated with the moderate fluid group was present at the completion of day-1 and increased each day until day 6, after which the mortality benefit persisted but did not increase in magnitude (Table S7). Physicians in the moderate group administered less median IVFD 1 to patients with preexisting congestive heart failure (3.1 L), end-stage renal disease (2.6 L), and pulmonary hypertension (3.0 L) POA compared with the total cohort (4.0 L). Patients within these groups experienced reduced mortality compared with the very low or very high fluid groups (Fig. S7).

We observed that patients in the moderate fluid group required a lower risk-adjusted rate of mechanical ventilation: –5.8% vs. very low, –2.7% vs. low, –1.2% vs. high, and –5.1% vs. very high during the first day of care (p < 0.01 for all comparisons). This finding persisted across both lower and higher severity groups, among patient subgroups that did/did not require vasopressors on day-1, and patients with congestive heart failure, end-stage renal disease, and pulmonary hypertension POA. We observed that physicians who administered a very low or low IVFD 1 did not prescribe higher risk-adjusted rates of vasopressors, while physicians who administered very high IVFD 1 did prescribe more vasopressors (Table 2 and Fig. 2).

Following screening of titles and abstracts, 88 were selected for full-text assessment. Before resolution, agreement between authors was 91%. From these 88 articles, nine studies were considered for data extraction. Before resolution, agreement between authors was 82%. None of these were unpublished, but one was in abstract format only. Ultimately, all nine trials with a total of 32,777 participants were included in this systematic review. Four of these trials were cluster randomized trials, and five were randomized trials at the patient level. Eight of the trials had data available on mortality (n = 32,596), seven on AKI (n = 31,486) and six on the need for new RRT (n = 31,612). Please note that these numbers have not yet been adjusted for design effect.

### The relationship between volume overload in end-stage renal disease and obstructive sleep apnea [^114RKGpb]. Seminars in Dialysis (2015). Low credibility.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is common, underdiagnosed, and undertreated among patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). As in all cases, pathogenesis of OSA is related to repeated upper airway (UA) occlusion or narrowing, but in ESRD, additional contributory factors likely include uremic destabilization of central respiratory control and anatomic changes in the UA related to fluid status. Pulmonary congestion is common in acute and chronic kidney failure and is a consequence of cardiomyopathy and fluid overload, two potentially reversible risk factors. Emerging evidence suggests that volume overload also reduces the UA caliber. The diminution in UA area as well as destabilization of ventilatory control in ESRD have been postulated as causes of increased OSA prevalence and severity in these patients, and creates a vicious cycle wherein OSA exacerbates fluid overload disorders such as in congestive heart failure (CHF) and ESRD, which then further worsen OSA. Dialysis modalities may differ in their effects on volume status, the accumulation of uremic toxins, and acid-base status, and as a consequence, on the emergence and severity of OSA. Given the contribution of excess fluid to both the severity of nocturnal hypoxia and UA narrowing, establishing and maintaining dry weight is of particular importance when managing OSA in ESRD. Clinical trials to determine the extent to which more aggressive fluid removal in ESRD patients may alleviate OSA are needed.

### Choice of fluids in critically ill patients [^11769uM8]. BMC Anesthesiology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Fluids are probably the most commonly administered intravenous treatment in inpatient care. Because of their excellent safety profile, until recently fluid solutions were not considered "medications". Little to no thought was therefore invested in the choice of fluids to be administered in specific clinical scenarios. However, recent evidence on long-term effects has altered our view on the different types of fluids available for fluid resuscitation. Intravenous fluids should be seen as drugs affecting the cardiovascular, renal, gastrointestinal and immune systems and should therefore not be administered "blindly".

Emphasis on the importance of volume above all the other characteristics of the fluids administered was nurtured by early guidelines that focused on administering specific fluid volumes to hemodynamically unstable patients (i.e. the surviving sepsis campaign). It is true that fluid administration is an important component of treatment of overt tissue hypoperfusion and hypoxia. Fluids may expand the intra-vascular compartment, thereby improving cardiac output (CO) and end-organ perfusion. However, the most common error with regards to fluid administration is the belief that resuscitation hinges on transfusion of a specific volume of fluids.

Disease processes are dynamic and their response to fluid may change over time. Specific disease states may also require different fluid therapy. Evidence from perioperative settings has associated both hypo- and hypervolemia with several unfavorable outcomes, including acute kidney injury (AKI), respiratory complications, increased lengths of stays, admission costs and 30-day-mortality rates. Later iterations of the guidelines have therefore clarified that the aim of fluid resuscitation is restoration of end-organ perfusion and correction of physiological imbalance. Follow-up during fluid administration should therefore include surrogate markers of organ perfusion (e.g. mean arterial pressure, central venous oxygen saturation, lactate, CO), markers of circulation, blood electrolyte and acid-base composition and indicators of renal function. No fluid is ideal for all disease conditions at all times. This review presents the current state of knowledge regarding the types of fluids to be administered with an emphasis on several disease states.

### Permissive hypofiltration [^113G9Tt1]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a syndrome with a multitude of causes and is associated with high mortality and a permanent loss of renal function. Our current understanding of the most common causes of AKI is limited, and thus a silver bullet therapy remains elusive. A change in the approach to AKI that shifts away from the primary composite endpoint of death/dialysis, and instead focuses on improving survival and mitigating permanent renal damage, is likely to be more fruitful. We suggest that the current approach of augmenting renal function by increasing the renal blood flow or glomerular filtration rate during AKI may actually worsen outcomes. Analogous to the approach towards adult respiratory distress syndrome that limits ventilator-induced lung injury, we propose the concept of permissive hypofiltration. The primary goals of this approach are: resting the kidney by providing early renal replacement therapy, avoiding the potentially injurious adverse events that occur during AKI (for example, fluid overload, hypophosphatemia, hypothermia, and so forth), and initiating therapies focused on improving survival and mitigating permanent loss of kidney function.

### A European renal best practice (ERBP) position statement on the kidney disease improving global outcomes (KDIGO) clinical practice guidelines on acute kidney injury: part 1: definitions, conservative management and contrast-induced nephropathy [^112SPgM7]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2012). Low credibility.

Rationale

Patients at increased risk for AKI and particularly those with manifest AKI require careful monitoring of their haemodynamic status, in order to balance the risk of renal hypoperfusion on the one hand and fluid overload on the other. Cardiac output and blood pressure should be kept within optimal limits to ensure the best possible kidney perfusion. However, as recently reported, hazardous fluid overload must be avoided, particularly in anuric patients with AKI. Available therapies to manage hypotension should integrate fluid and vasopressor therapy in protocols with appropriate haemodynamic goals. When volume resuscitation is deemed necessary, there is sufficient evidence to support the recommendation that there is no additional advantage of (more expensive) colloid over crystalloid solutions; therefore ERBP upgraded the strength of this recommendation. However, ERBP wants to stress that this rule does not apply in patients in whom a decrease in the circulating volume is present, e.g. in haemorrhagic shock. In these conditions, the use of colloids can be warranted; iso-osmolar solutions, with low molecular branching coefficients should be preferred. ERBP also wants to point out that the use of large quantities of isotonic saline can potentially lead to metabolic acidosis.

As renal perfusion pressure is more important than renal blood flow per se, and as the action of vasopressors is immediate and directly reversible, ERBP recommends using vasopressor therapy rather than extra fluid in volume-resuscitated patients. Here, norepinephrine has advantages over dopamine, because of fewer side-effects and lower costs, but vasopressin may be used as an alternative. Several meta-analyses have pointed out that dopamine failed to improve outcomes in patients with AKI. Finally, protocol-based goal-directed therapy is advocated in the early hours of sepsis. Such goal-directed therapy includes avoiding hypotension, optimizing oxygen delivery and careful fluid and vasopressor management when indicated. Some clinical studies have highlighted the need to keep mean arterial blood pressure above 65 mmHg in critically ill patients, but the speed of intervention seems to be very important as well.

### Variability in usual care fluid resuscitation and risk-adjusted outcomes for mechanically ventilated patients in shock [^113WRMot]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this retrospective outcome analysis using the 2013 Premier and 2013–2016 Truven databases, we found highly variable day 1 fluid resuscitation practices among mechanically ventilated patients with hemodynamic shock from diverse etiologies. Our results are consistent with prior observations associating over-resuscitation with adverse outcomes. However, we also found that lower-than-expected day 1 fluid resuscitation, while beneficial among patients with certain diagnoses predictive of receiving less fluids (e.g. heart failure, end-stage renal disease), was associated with increased risk-adjusted hospital mortality among a relatively healthier patient cohort without such diagnoses; a U-shaped relationship.

Initial fluid resuscitation practices for patients with hemodynamic shock remain controversial. Recently published data from a prospective randomized control pilot study of patients with severe sepsis and septic shock demonstrated no increase in adverse outcomes using a restrictive fluid resuscitation strategy in the first 72 h of care. Larger multicenter trials comparing fluid-restrictive and fluid-liberal resuscitation are currently underway. Nevertheless, the non-uniform response to fluid resuscitation between patients with and without an FRF observed in our study suggests widely inclusive fluid resuscitation strategies in usual care and outside of study protocols may not be appropriate for all patients. Moreover, while over-resuscitation is increasingly recognized as harmful to patients with shock and fluid-restrictive strategies are currently being evaluated in large multicenter trials, our findings stress that under-resuscitation may also be harmful particularly for a subgroup of patients without FRFs.

Only half of shock patients respond positively to a volume challenge, indicating that many may have effective circulating fluid volumes despite macrocirculatory shock. Diagnoses identified as FRFs frequently include volume overload as a primary or secondary feature, potentially explaining the observed mortality benefit of receiving less-than-expected fluid volumes among patients with at least one of these conditions. Patients without an FRF were generally younger and had fewer comorbidities and acute organ dysfunctions present on admission. They also had lower predicted hospital mortality compared to patients with an FRF. Nonetheless, hospital mortality for patients without an FRF was increased with higher and lower fluid volumes and with greater- and less-than-expected fluid resuscitation. These findings challenge the assumption that younger and presumably healthier patients are more tolerant of a wide range of fluid resuscitation volumes. Likewise, we observed significantly lower ICU and hospital resource utilization and lower hospital costs among patients without an FRF despite higher-than-predicted risk-adjusted hospital mortality. This incongruity may reflect relatively less attentive care-titration for a population presumed to have lower risk for further clinical decompensation.

### Volume overload and adverse outcomes in chronic kidney disease: clinical observational and animal studies [^113KXisf]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Volume overload exhibits a strong association with CKD progression and CVD morbidity or mortality in patients with stage 3 to 5 CKD. In animal models of CKD, salt-induced fluid retention results in renal and cardiovascular damage, which is ameliorated by diuretics. Therefore, our findings suggest that volume overload is an important mechanism contributing to the adverse outcomes observed in CKD and requires appropriate management. Further research is warranted to clarify whether the correction of volume overload should be one of the main targets to achieve better outcomes in patients with CKD.

### Blood pressure and volume management in dialysis: conclusions from a kidney disease: improving global outcomes (KDIGO) controversies conference [^1127c38q]. Kidney International (2020). Medium credibility.

Blood pressure (BP) and volume control are critical components of dialysis care and have substantial impacts on patient symptoms, quality of life, and cardiovascular complications. Yet, developing consensus best practices for BP and volume control have been challenging, given the absence of objective measures of extracellular volume status and the lack of high-quality evidence for many therapeutic interventions. In February of 2019, Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) held a Controversies Conference titled Blood Pressure and Volume Management in Dialysis to assess the current state of knowledge related to BP and volume management and identify opportunities to improve clinical and patient-reported outcomes among individuals receiving maintenance dialysis. Four major topics were addressed: BP measurement, BP targets, and pharmacologic management of suboptimal BP; dialysis prescriptions as they relate to BP and volume; extracellular volume assessment and management with a focus on technology-based solutions; and volume-related patient symptoms and experiences. The overarching theme resulting from presentations and discussions was that managing BP and volume in dialysis involves weighing multiple clinical factors and risk considerations as well as patient lifestyle and preferences, all within a narrow therapeutic window for avoiding acute or chronic volume-related complications. Striking this challenging balance requires individualizing the dialysis prescription by incorporating comorbid health conditions, treatment hemodynamic patterns, clinical judgment, and patient preferences into decision-making, all within local resource constraints.

### Clinical practice guidelines for hemodialysis adequacy, update 2006 [^117UiDWY]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2006). Medium credibility.

Hemodialysis volume status and dry weight — Rationale and approach note that analysis "showed that weight gain between dialyses of more than 4.8% (ie, 3.4 kg in a 70 kg person), a reflection of excessive sodium and water intake, is associated with increased mortality". A patient's true dry weight "can be determined accurately, but the method is not readily available in clinical settings (eg, use of multiple-frequency bioimpedance spectroscopy)". Recognition of occult overload is important because "a patient can have fluid excess in the absence of gross clinical evidence of volume expansion, a phenomenon termed "silent overhydration". For fluid-overloaded patients, "this step-by-step process of identifying, or "probing", for the true dry weight through ultrafiltration — but without inducing hypotension — should be accomplished gradually over a number of dialysis treatments (usually over 4 to 12 weeks, but it may require as long as 6 to 12 months) until evidence of fluid overload is in abeyance".

### Clinical pharmacy activities in chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease patients: a systematic literature review [^116mzEZ9]. BMC Nephrology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) represents a major public health problem in developed and developing countries. It is estimated that approximately 5% of the adult U.S. population is affected by CKD, which is defined as serum creatinine concentrations greater than 1.2 to 1.5 mg/dL. The European Kidney Health Alliance (EKHA) reports that approximately 10% of European citizens are affected by some degree of CKD.

CKD and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) are associated with an increased risk of mortality, increased rate of hospitalisation, and decreased life expectancy. Progression from early to late stages of CKD generally results in the onset of new symptoms and concomitant complications. Frequent complications and comorbidities of CKD include fluid and electrolyte abnormalities, anaemia, secondary hyperparathyroidism and renal osteodystrophy, hypertension and hyperlipidaemia, metabolic acidosis, and several other comorbidities involving malnutrition, pruritus and uremic bleeding. CKD patients are at increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), which includes coronary heart disease (CHD), cerebrovascular disease, peripheral vascular disease, and heart failure. The management of underlying and evident comorbidities (either as causes or consequences of CKD) and the prevention or delay of its progression to ESRD are complex.

In ESRD patients, the initiation of renal replacement therapies (RRTs), such as long-term dialysis (including haemodialysis (HD) or peritoneal dialysis (PD)) or transplantation, is usually indicated to relieve uremic symptoms and detoxify, whereas kidney transplantation (cadaveric or living donor transplantation) is the therapy of choice for ESRD.

Multidisciplinary health care teams of physicians, nurses, dieticians, and clinical pharmacists share the goal of preventing disease progression and managing comorbid conditions in CKD and ESRD patients. As specialists in pharmacotherapy, clinical pharmacists are routinely involved in patient care and interact with other health care professionals, addressing multiple, often unmet needs for pharmacotherapy optimisation. Ideally, this happens through a preventive, rather than a reactive, approach. Evidence from the literature supports the involvement of clinical pharmacists in several disease areas and underlines the positive patient outcomes and improvement of care that result.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the primary care management of chronic kidney disease [^113BZWCM]. VA/DoD (2025). High credibility.

VA/DoD CKD guideline — contrast-enhanced imaging prophylaxis and decision-making recommends IV fluid strategies while avoiding delays in necessary imaging. Administration of IV volume expansion before and after contrast imaging is recommended for high-risk patients with CKD, and the Work Group recommended that patients at increased risk of CA-AKI receive volume expansion with IV isotonic crystalloid solutions prior to and following contrast administration. The risk of AKI associated with contrast exposure should not prevent the performance of medically necessary contrast-enhanced tomography; the guideline states that clinically indicated contrast-enhanced imaging should not be avoided solely on perceived risk of CA-AKI and that, in general, prophylactic IV fluid expansion is only required for individuals with an eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m², with prophylaxis also to be considered for individuals with an eGFR between 30–44 mL/min/1.73 m² depending on other risk factors. Thus, the Work Group suggests that providers weigh the benefits of IV fluid volume expansion with the risks associated with delaying urgent or emergent imaging and procedures, and notes that providers should forgo IV fluid expansion rather than delay medically necessary imaging or procedures.

1) Are there individual patient populations in which saline should be avoided entirely? Testing types of fluids in subgroups of patients to detect the likelihood of adverse effects would be useful.
2) Are there differences between buffered solutions? Is lactated Ringers superior to acetated/gluconated buffered solution or vice versa?
3) What are the implications of acetate and gluconate contained in some balanced solutions? In cardiac surgery patients, an acetate-based balanced solution had similar hemodynamic effects compared with lactated ringers. However, significant infusion of acetate may contribute to vasoplegia and myocardial dysfunction in patients with kidney dysfunction.
4) Recent data suggest that maintenance fluids and fluids used in diluting drugs may provide significant amount of chloride and have a major impact on fluid balance. Data suggest that selecting sodium/chloride poor maintenance fluids may improve fluid balance and chloride load in postoperative patients, but data in septic patients are still lacking. As such, should chloride containing solutions (including balanced solutions) be minimized or entirely avoided? Notably, this question is especially pertinent given recent instances of supply chain interruption, resulting in shortages of critical fluids and necessitating therapeutic substitutions at the individual patient level.
5) Are the beneficial renal outcomes associated with buffered solutions compared with saline due to the reduction in chloride content? In other words, is chloride toxic in itself, so that toxicity occurs even in absence of obvious hyperchloremia/acidosis (in which condition chloride-free solutions should be favored and saline-based dilution of drugs should be avoided whenever possible) or is it deviation of chloride/pH that generates the toxicity of high volumes of NaCl 0.9% (in which context closer monitoring of these variables may limit the toxicity)? Can lactated sodium solutions serve as a substitute for saline to minimize renal injury?
6) Is albumin superior to buffered crystalloid solutions? If used, when should albumin be administered? Ideally, this comparison of albumin with balanced crystalloid solutions would include subgroups of patients of particular interest (chronic kidney disease, cirrhosis).
7) Should albumin be initiated in an attempt to correct hypoalbuminemia or as a volume replacement fluid? Given the colloidal qualities of albumin, would albumin be of greater benefit in cases of severe shock, necessitating greater amounts of fluid resuscitation? Or should it be used to correct hypoalbuminemia? If there is a benefit to albumin administration as a fluid resuscitation therapy, where does it provide the greatest benefit in light of its cost?
8) What is the optimal concentration of the albumin solution (4–5% or 20%)? Studies of albumin have evaluated various concentrations of albumin. Contingent on its proposed mechanism of benefit in fluid resuscitation (correction of hypoalbuminemia vs intravascular fluid expansion), studies comparing the various albumin concentrations are necessary.
9) Should severity of sepsis play a role in determining which fluid to use for resuscitation? In the continuum of sepsis and septic shock, would patients specifically with more severe forms of shock benefit from a combination approach of crystalloids and colloids to fluid resuscitation?
10) Does resource setting play a role in determining the efficacy of which fluid is chosen? Studies outlined above were performed in resource-intensive environments. Considering data demonstrating that outcomes to fluid resuscitation are disparate between resource-intensive environments and resource-limited environments, it is possible that the type of fluid might also impact outcomes, understanding that fluid choices will likely be significantly more limited in resource \-constrained locations and in the face of unpredictable supply.

### Optimising the timing of renal replacement therapy in acute kidney injury [^115iSeg4]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Initiation of organ support therapy is a complex decision integral to practice in the intensive care unit (ICU). Such decisions extend beyond whether these therapies simply normalise relevant physiological parameters and include triage, prognostication and resource allocation, as well as an assessment of the potential for the intervention to cause more harm than benefit in individual patients. When considering renal replacement therapy (RRT) for acute kidney injury (AKI), critical care physicians are required to balance the hazards of starting too early, risking patient exposure to an unnecessary therapy with its attendant complications and costs, against the potential life-threatening harm of initiating too late.

In certain circumstances, decision making is relatively clear. There is little doubt RRT should be started promptly in the presence of life-threatening indications (hyperkalaemia, severe metabolic acidosis, pulmonary oedema, certain drug toxicities), and it is equally clear that RRT is not necessary when these indications are absent and there is evidence of recovery from AKI. RRT is also inappropriate when it is incompatible with patient preferences and treatment goals. However, many critically ill patients continue to meet AKI criteria without developing either an indication for urgent dialysis or evidence of imminent recovery. For these patients, clinicians face a difficult question. Should RRT be initiated early, risking over-treatment, or should it be delayed as long as possible, potentially prolonging exposure to fluid overload and solute imbalance? Five important studies over the past 5 years have attempted to address this question.

Alternative dialysis schedules for persistent fluid overload — For conventionally dialyzed patients (3 sessions per week, ≤ 4 hours per session) who remain overloaded despite maximally tolerable ultrafiltration, proposed regimens include short-daily (2 to 3 hours for each treatment, 6 or 7 treatments per week), long nocturnal thrice-weekly (8 hours for each session), and long nocturnal (8 hours for each session) schedules for 6 to 7 nights per week, all reported to remove excess fluid and improve hypertension satisfactorily; a longer weekly treatment time (5 hours per session, 3 times per week) was associated with less postdialysis postural hypotension than 4 hours per session, 3 times per week, and periods of isolated ultrafiltration can be added to a standard regimen.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2012 KDIGO clinical practice guideline for acute kidney injury [^115bjeSL]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2013). Medium credibility.

KDOQI US commentary on the KDIGO acute kidney injury (AKI) guideline states that the KDIGO definition and staging criteria are "appropriate for defining the epidemiology of AKI and in the design of clinical trials", but concludes "there is insufficient evidence to support their widespread application to clinical care in the United States". The panel "generally concurred with the remainder of the KDIGO guidelines that are focused on the prevention and pharmacologic and dialytic management of AKI", while emphasizing "the dearth of clinical trial evidence to provide strong evidence-based recommendations" and "the continued absence of effective therapies beyond hemodynamic optimization and avoidance of nephrotoxins for the prevention and treatment of AKI". For clinical context, AKI "represents the sudden loss of kidney function, generally occurring over the course of hours to days and resulting in the retention of metabolic waste products and the development of volume overload and electrolyte and acid-base abnormalities".

### Sepsis management for the nephrologist [^113zJifP]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

The definition of sepsis has evolved significantly over the past three decades. Today, sepsis is defined as a dysregulated host immune response to microbial invasion leading to end organ dysfunction. Septic shock is characterized by hypotension requiring vasopressors after adequate fluid resuscitation with elevated lactate. Early recognition and intervention remain hallmarks for sepsis management. We addressed the current literature and assimilated thought regarding optimum initial resuscitation of the patient with sepsis. A nuanced understanding of the physiology of lactate is provided in our review. Physiologic and practical knowledge of steroid and vasopressor therapy for sepsis is crucial and addressed. As blood purification may interest the nephrologist treating sepsis, we have also added a brief discussion of its status.

### Fluid resuscitation with 6% hydroxyethyl starch (130 / 0.4 and 130 / 0.42) in acutely ill patients: systematic review of effects on mortality and treatment with renal replacement therapy [^117T7Ucz]. Intensive Care Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

To determine whether fluid resuscitation of acutely ill adults with 6% hydroxyethyl starch (6% HES 130) with a molecular weight of 130 kD and a molar substitution ratio of approximately 0.4 (6% HES 130) compared with other resuscitation fluids results in a difference in the relative risk of death or treatment with renal replacement therapy (RRT).

Methods

Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials comparing intravascular fluids for resuscitation of hospitalised adults that reported mortality or treatment with RRT. The risk of bias was assessed independently by two reviewers and meta-analysis was performed using random effects.

Results

Thirty-five trials enrolling 10,391 participants were included. The three largest trials had the lowest risk of bias, were published (or completed) in 2012, and together enrolled 77% of all participants. Death occurred in 928 of 4,691 patients (19.8%) in the 6% HES 130 group versus 871 of 4,720 (18.5%) in the control fluid groups relative risk (RR) in the 6% HES 130 group 1.08, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.00 to 1.17, I² = 0%). Treatment with RRT occurred in 378 of 4,236 patients (8.9%) in the 6% HES 130 group versus 306 of 4,260 (7.2%) in the control fluid group (RR in the 6% HES 130 group 1.25, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.44, I² = 0%).

Conclusions

The quality and quantity of data evaluating 6% hydroxyethyl starch (130/0.4 and 130/0.42) as a resuscitation fluid has increased in the last 12 months. Patients randomly assigned to resuscitation with 6%HES 130 are at significantly increased risk of being treated with RRT.

### Resuscitation fluid types in sepsis, surgical, and trauma patients: a systematic review and sequential network meta-analyses [^1121pDZo]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Methods

Data sources and searches

We registered our systematic review process on the PROSPERO website (registration number: CRD42018115641). This NMA followed the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) extension guideline which incorporated NMA for healthcare interventions (Additional file 1: appendix pp. 8–13). Electronic databases, including PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane CENTRAL, were searched from their inception until January 2020. The search strategies combined terms for patients' conditions, clinical outcomes, and fluid types (Additional file 1: appendix pp. 14–15).

Study selection

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on critically ill adult patients (more than 18 years old) who presented with systemic hypoperfusion and required fluid resuscitation. We excluded trials on children with dengue fever, those on burn injury patients, or those on mixed populations without reporting subgroup data (Additional file 1: appendix pp. 17–20).

Data extraction and quality assessment

We divided patients requiring fluid resuscitation into the following groups for extraction of data and separate analyses: sepsis, surgical, trauma, and traumatic brain injury. The 7 interventions included 2 crystalloids [balanced crystalloids, including lactated Ringer's, Ringer acetate or PlasmaLytes and saline (0.9% sodium chloride)], and 5 colloids [iso-oncotic albumin (4%, 5%); hyperoncotic albumin (20%, or 25%); HES with molecular weight ≦ 130 k (L-HES); HES with molecular weight ≧ 200 k (H-HES); and gelatin]. The outcomes included:
All-cause mortality rate. If a study reported outcomes at multiple time points, we chose the longest observation.
Fluid resuscitation volume. The resuscitation target is the reversal of organ hypoperfusion.
Acute kidney injury, referring to the degree of renal dysfunction, based on a 5-level scoring system to evaluate risk, injury, failure, loss, and end-stage renal failure (RIFLE).
Transfusion volume.
Allergic reaction rate.

Two authors (CH Tseng and TT Chen) screened the studies on RCTs independently, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias of studies using the revised Cochrane risk of bias tool (RoB 2 tool) at study level. A third reviewer (YK Tu) was consulted to resolve any disagreement in data extraction or assessment.

### Hyperkalemia in dialysis patients [^117ADNFa]. Seminars in Dialysis (2001). Low credibility.

Serious hyperkalemia is common in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and accounts for considerable morbidity and death. Mechanisms of extrarenal disposal of potassium (gastrointestinal excretion and cellular uptake) play a crucial role in the defense against hyperkalemia in this population. In this article we review extrarenal potassium homeostasis and its alteration in patients with ESRD. We pay particular attention to the factors that influence the movement of potassium across cell membranes. With that background we discuss the emergency treatment of hyperkalemia in patients with ESRD. We conclude with a review of strategies to reduce the risk of hyperkalemia in this population of patients.

### Intravascular volume therapy in adults: guidelines from the Association of the Scientific Medical Societies in Germany [^115zzddq]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2016). Low credibility.

Background to recommendation 4b-4

The recommendation to use balanced solutions was substantially influenced by a series of endpoints classified as surrogate that were supported by the well substantiated association between unbalanced solutions and hyperchloraemia and acidosis, with adverse effects on mortality, infection and renal insufficiency.,

These studies analysed in the intervention arms investigated the differential effects of balanced versus unbalanced crystalloid and colloid solutions in general.

The grade of recommendation (GoR B) reflects the fact that, in terms of the mortality endpoint, the studies and patient numbers available for analysis are exceptionally low. Accordingly, no adequately corroborated statements can be made in this context, and the recommendation for using balanced solutions is therefore based on the summary analyses of the other endpoints beyond that of mortality.

### Fluid balance management during continuous renal replacement therapy [^114Sp73J]. Seminars in Dialysis (2021). Medium credibility.

In critically ill patients, particularly in the setting of shock and sepsis volume management frequently results in a fluid overloaded state, requiring diuresis or intervention with renal replacement therapy. Achieving appropriate volume management requires knowledge of the underlying cardiovascular pathophysiology and careful evaluation of intravascular and extravascular volume status. In the presence of a failing kidney, fluid removal is often a challenge. Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) techniques offer a significant advantage over intermittent dialysis for fluid control, however, any form of RRT in the critically ill patient requires careful attention to prescription and monitoring to avoid complications. In order to utilize these therapies for their maximum potential it is necessary to understand which factors influence fluid balance and have an understanding of the principles and kinetics of fluid removal with extra-corporeal techniques.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the primary care management of chronic kidney disease [^114R2XPf]. VA/DoD (2025). High credibility.

VA/DoD CKD CPG — prophylactic IV isotonic crystalloid around contrast exposure — reports that the Work Group suggests that IV isotonic crystalloid be administered to reduce the risk of CA-AKI in high-risk patients unless IV fluid administration is contraindicated or would delay emergency imaging or procedures; the strength of evidence supporting the use of isotonic crystalloid to mitigate the risk for development of CA-AKI in high-risk patients is strong based on studies demonstrating greater risk reduction associated with higher volumes of administered isotonic fluids; for more urgent studies, patients can be given at least 3 mL/kg of isotonic saline one hour pre-procedure continued at a rate of 1–1.5 mL/kg/hour during the procedure, and at least an additional 6 mL/kg of isotonic saline over 2–6 hours at a rate of 1–3 mL/kg/hour post-procedure; for routine studies in hospitalized patients, the Work Group suggests the administration of isotonic saline at 1 mL/kg/hour for at least 6–12 hours pre-procedure, intra-procedure, and for at least 6–12 hours post-procedure, and these suggestions assume that an assessment of volume status has been done and that patients are reasonably able to tolerate this amount of fluid.

### End-stage renal disease… [^111c3e6G]. AAFP (2010). Low credibility.

Risk factors for ESRD include older age; hypertension; diabetes mellitus; obesity; history of renal disease; and tobacco, heroin, or analgesic use. ESRD leads to fluid retention, anemia, disturbances of bone and mineral metabolism, and increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Increasing the dose of peritoneal dialysis does not seem to reduce mortality. In persons receiving hemodialysis, there is no difference in mortality for high flux hemodialysis compared with low flux hemodialysis, or increased-dose compared with standard-dose hemodialysis. Erythropoietin and darbepoetin may help maintain hemoglobin levels in persons with ESRD, although normalizing hemoglobin levels in persons with both ESRD and CVD may increase mortality. Mupirocin reduces Staphylococcus aureus infections compared with placebo or no treatment. The use of statins in persons with ESRD does not seem to reduce mortality or cardiovascular events.

Definition ESRD is defined as irreversible decline in kidney function that is severe enough to be fatal in the absence of dialysis or transplantation. ESRD is included under stage 5 of the National Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative classification of chronic kidney disease, where it refers to persons with an estimated glomerular filtration rate less than 15 mL per minute per 1.73 m². Fluid retention in persons with ESRD contributes significantly to the hypertension, ventricular dysfunction, and excess cardiovascular events observed in this population. Anemia associated with chronic kidney disease is normocytic and normochromic, and is most commonly attributed to reduced erythropoietin synthesis by the affected kidneys.

Additional factors that contribute to the anemia include iron deficiency from frequent phlebotomy, blood retention in the dialyzer and tubing, and gastrointestinal bleeding; severe secondary hyperparathyroidism; acute and chronic inflammatory conditions; and shortened red blood cell survival. Among persons receiving renal replacement therapy, CVD is the leading cause of mortality and accounts for more than 40 percent of deaths in this population. Extracellular volume overload and hypertension — which are common among persons with chronic kidney disease — are known predictors of left ventricular hypertrophy and cardiovascular mortality in this population. Even after adjustment for age, sex, race or ethnicity, and the presence of diabetes, annual cardiovascular mortality remains roughly an order of magnitude higher in persons with ESRD than in the general population, particularly among younger persons.

### Dialysis… [^111q7ARX]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

End-stage renal disease is when kidney function is no longer adequate for long-term survival without kidney transplantation or dialysis. 1, 2 The estimated glomerular filtration rate is usually less than 15 mL per minute per 1.73 m² when this occurs. 3 Kidney failure, a more concise term, may soon replace ESRD.
4. In the United States, nearly 90% of patients with ESRD are treated with center-based hemodialysis, but many patients are unaware that other options exist. 5, 13 Alternatives include in-home hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis, which can provide flexibility in frequency and duration of dialysis sessions. Patients who receive targeted education before the initiation of dialysis are more likely to choose peritoneal dialysis. 13–15. Alone, GFR does not determine when dialysis is initiated; instead, guidelines advise starting dialysis when irreversible signs or symptoms of ESRD manifest.

3, 14, 16 Common indications for dialysis include persistent volume overload; refractory metabolic disorders such as metabolic acidosis and hyperkalemia; cognitive impairment; and worsening nutritional status. 3 Table 2 lists indications for initiation of dialysis. 3, 14 |Uncontrolled hypertension| Most patients with ESRD will be treated with hemodialysis, and arteriovenous access is usually preferred. Early referral allows for evaluation and creation of vascular access before dialysis is needed. For patients with stage III to V chronic kidney disease, strategies to preserve peripheral venous access are important. These include avoiding excessive venipuncture, peripherally inserted central venous catheters, and subclavian venous catheters.

Other Considerations VACCINATION Because of immune suppression and increased susceptibility to infection in patients with ESRD, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provides specific vaccination recommendations for this population. Routine vaccinations against seasonal influenza and tetanus should be continued in these patients. Additionally, the CDC recommends hepatitis B and pneumococcal vaccination. Medical Complications of ESRD Clinicians caring for patients with ESRD should be aware of its many complications. Patients with ESRD are at increased risk of bleeding due to platelet dysfunction, although dialysis may attenuate this risk.

### Additional therapies… [^111AXjoS]. AAFP (2022). Medium credibility.

- After initial resuscitation with 30 mL per kg of crystalloid fluids, further fluid resuscitation should be based on intravascular volume status and organ perfusion from dynamic measures.
- Empiric antibiotics should be started within one hour in septic shock and within three hours without shock. Empiric coverage for MRSA, gram-negative resistance, or fungal infection is recommended if these pathogens are considered likely. Resuscitation With sepsis-induced hypoperfusion or shock, resuscitation with 30 mL per kg of crystalloid fluids is recommended within the first three hours. Failing to meet this initial resuscitation guideline delays resolution of hypotension and increases intensive care duration and mortality. Subsequent resuscitation depends on intravascular volume status and organ perfusion.

Static measures such as heart rate, central venous pressure, and systolic blood pressure are poor indicators of fluid status, and using dynamic measures reduces mortality with a risk ratio of 0.
59. Dynamic measures of fluid status include cardiac output measurement during passive leg raising, stroke volume measurement in response to fluid challenges or changes in intrathoracic pressure, and changes in pulse pressure or systolic blood pressure in response to fluid challenges. Although lactate levels often will not decrease to normal, levels approaching normal suggest successful resuscitation. Normalization of capillary refill time can also demonstrate resuscitation. If vasopressors are necessary after initial fluid resuscitation, the target mean arterial pressure is 65 mm Hg because higher targets do not improve survival. Vasopressors should be started peripherally rather than waiting for central venous access.

Arterial blood pressure monitoring is essential and carries low risks of limb ischemia and bleeding. Intensive care admission should be completed within six hours because mortality increases when emergency department stays exceed that time frame. Higher positive end-expiratory pressure improves mortality only in moderate or severe ARDS, with an arterial oxygen pressure to inspired oxygen ratio up to 200 mm Hg. PEEP can be titrated to find the lowest driving pressure or to bring plateau airway pressures to 28 cm of water. In moderate to severe ARDS, prone positioning for more than 12 hours a day within the first 36 hours of intubation improves survival. Prone positioning does not appear to increase life-threatening complications but does increase risk of pressure sores.
