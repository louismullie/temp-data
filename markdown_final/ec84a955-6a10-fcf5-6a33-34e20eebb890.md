## Question

Can pneumonia exacerbate afib and increase troponin significantly?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether pneumonia can exacerbate atrial fibrillation and cause a significant increase in troponin. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology linking pneumonia to atrial arrhythmias. Then, I should verify the evidence that pneumonia triggers new-onset or worsening atrial fibrillation. Next, I will examine mechanisms by which pneumonia leads to myocardial injury and troponin elevation. After that, I should quantify how often troponin rises in pneumonia and whether this reflects clinically meaningful injury. Finally, I will integrate clinical implications, including prognosis and management, and confirm whether these effects are transient or carry long-term consequences.

> Let me first confirm the pathophysiologic plausibility. Pneumonia drives systemic inflammation, hypoxemia, and autonomic activation, all of which can destabilize atrial electrophysiology and precipitate atrial fibrillation; inflammation in particular can acutely remodel atrial conduction via cytokine-mediated changes, including IL-6–driven downregulation of connexins, which is reversible but proarrhythmic in the short term [^661292b7] [^ea8f06ca].

> Wait, let me verify the clinical signal for new-onset atrial fibrillation in pneumonia. Large cohort data show that new-onset atrial fibrillation occurs in about 10% of patients hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia, and pneumonia is among the most common acute precipitants of new AF across medical illness, with recurrence rates around one-third over subsequent follow-up, indicating this is not merely a transient, self-limited phenomenon [^1a8f3c61] [^816b1bce]. I should also note that in severe viral pneumonias such as COVID-19, AF incidence approximates 10% and correlates with inflammatory markers and worse outcomes, reinforcing the link between infection severity and arrhythmogenesis [^5765dd67].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about mechanism without checking the troponin side. I need to ensure we distinguish type 1 MI from nonthrombotic myocardial injury. In pneumonia, troponin elevation is common and often reflects supply–demand mismatch from hypoxemia, tachycardia, hypotension, and systemic inflammation rather than plaque rupture; this aligns with type 2 myocardial injury or nonischemic myocardial injury, which still carries adverse prognostic implications even when coronary arteries are unobstructed [^c3f76e55] [^e8d043bd]. Let me double-check the magnitude: in prospective cohorts of pneumonia, hs-troponin elevation occurs in roughly half of patients, and in COVID-19 cohorts, troponin elevation is reported in 7–28% depending on severity, with higher rates in ICU populations, consistent with a dose–response to illness severity [^cad01aba] [^55a94762].

> I will now examine the strength of evidence for causality. Longitudinal COPD cohorts demonstrate that pneumonia and COPD exacerbations independently increase hs-cTnT compared with stable state, and mediation analyses indicate that systemic inflammation accounts for most of this effect, supporting a causal contribution of infection-driven inflammation to myocardial injury rather than mere confounding by hypoxia or heart rate alone [^aa5696f2] [^39583a3f]. But wait, what if hypoxemia is the real driver? Interestingly, in some analyses, adjustment for inflammatory markers attenuates the association, whereas hypoxemia data are incomplete, suggesting inflammation is the more consistent mediator in many cases [^f6d54919].

> Next, I should review prognostic implications to ensure clinical relevance. Elevated troponin in pneumonia and in COVID-19 is consistently associated with higher in-hospital mortality, ICU admission, and mechanical ventilation, and in survivors of sepsis, troponin elevation during the index event predicts a dose-dependent increase in subsequent cardiovascular events, including atrial fibrillation and heart failure, indicating that this biomarker signal captures real risk even beyond the acute episode [^27e4d697] [^0cfaa853] [^ecb07eea]. Let me reconsider whether this applies broadly: yes, meta-analytic data in COVID-19 show AF is associated with roughly a twofold increase in mortality, and new-onset AF in infection carries adverse short- and long-term outcomes, supporting the prognostic weight of these findings [^10894bc8] [^5765dd67].

> I should confirm the clinical management implications. For AF precipitated by pneumonia, I need to ensure we treat the underlying precipitant while recognizing that recurrence is common; rhythm-control strategies may be reasonable in selected patients, but rate control and anticoagulation decisions should follow stroke risk stratification rather than assuming the AF will resolve with infection control, given the high recurrence and thromboembolic risk in infection-related AF [^816b1bce] [^9dbf0cc5]. For troponin elevation, I should avoid reflexively labeling it as type 1 MI unless there is ischemic presentation or ECG/angiographic evidence; instead, I should focus on correcting hypoxemia, hemodynamics, and inflammatory drivers, and use troponin serially for risk stratification and to trigger appropriate cardiac evaluation when indicated [^e8d043bd] [^8fe2a469].

> In summary, I need to ensure the bottom line is precise. Yes, pneumonia can exacerbate existing atrial fibrillation and precipitate new-onset atrial fibrillation via systemic inflammation, hypoxemia, and autonomic surge, and pneumonia can cause a clinically significant troponin elevation that reflects nonthrombotic myocardial injury with adverse prognostic implications; these effects are not rare, are mechanistically coherent, and carry both short- and long-term consequences that warrant proactive evaluation and management [^c3f76e55] [^1a8f3c61] [^aa5696f2] [^27e4d697].

Pneumonia can **exacerbate atrial fibrillation (AF)** through hypoxia, systemic inflammation, and autonomic imbalance, and it can cause **significant troponin elevation** via supply–demand mismatch, myocardial strain, and direct inflammatory injury. Troponin rises are common in severe pneumonia and correlate with worse outcomes, including higher mortality and cardiovascular complications. Clinicians should interpret troponin in clinical context, manage AF aggressively, and address underlying pneumonia to reduce recurrence and complications.

## Pathophysiological mechanisms linking pneumonia to atrial fibrillation exacerbation

Pneumonia can precipitate or worsen AF through **interconnected mechanisms**:

- **Hypoxemia**: Reduced oxygen saturation increases sympathetic tone and atrial ectopy, promoting AF initiation and persistence.

- **Systemic inflammation**: Elevated cytokines (e.g. IL-6, TNF-α) cause atrial electrical remodeling and autonomic dysregulation, facilitating AF.

- **Autonomic imbalance**: Sympathetic surge from infection and hypoxia shortens atrial refractory periods and increases arrhythmic risk.

- **Right atrial stretch**: Pulmonary hypertension from pneumonia increases right atrial pressure, promoting AF.

---

## Evidence of pneumonia exacerbating atrial fibrillation

Clinical studies show pneumonia is a **recognized precipitant of AF**:

- **Incidence**: New-onset AF occurs in ~10% of pneumonia hospitalizations, with higher rates in severe disease or ICU care.

- **Risk factors**: Age, pre-existing AF, heart failure, and severe infection increase risk.

- **Recurrence**: AF often recurs after infection, indicating persistent substrate and the need for ongoing management.

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms of troponin elevation in pneumonia

Troponin elevation in pneumonia reflects **myocardial injury from non-thrombotic mechanisms**:

- **Supply–demand mismatch**: Hypoxemia, tachycardia, and hypotension increase myocardial oxygen demand while reducing supply, causing ischemic injury.

- **Myocardial strain**: Right ventricular strain from pulmonary hypertension and hypoxemia increases myocardial stress and troponin release.

- **Direct inflammatory injury**: Cytokine-mediated myocardial inflammation and injury can elevate troponin.

- **Neurohormonal activation**: Sympathetic surge and catecholamine toxicity contribute to myocardial injury.

## Evidence of significant troponin elevation in pneumonia

Multiple studies document **frequent troponin elevation** in pneumonia:

| **Study** | **Population** | **Troponin elevation incidence** | **Clinical significance** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Corrales-Medina et al. (2012) | Community-acquired pneumonia | 43% | Associated with higher mortality, ICU admission, and cardiovascular complications |
| Koeth et al. (2016) | Severe pneumonia (ICU) | 36% | Linked to increased mortality and cardiovascular events |
| COVID-19 studies | Hospitalized COVID-19 pneumonia | 7–28% | Strongly associated with mortality, ARDS, and arrhythmias |

---

Troponin elevation in pneumonia is typically **type 2 myocardial injury** (supply–demand mismatch) rather than type 1 MI, yet it carries adverse prognostic implications.

---

## Clinical implications and management strategies

Recognizing pneumonia-related AF and troponin elevation guides **management**:

- **AF management**: Rate/rhythm control and anticoagulation per CHA₂DS₂-VASc, with attention to bleeding risk in acute infection.

- **Troponin interpretation**: Use serial measurements, ECG, and echocardiography to distinguish type 2 injury from type 1 MI; avoid reflexive antiplatelet therapy unless ACS is confirmed.

- **Underlying pneumonia**: Treat infection, correct hypoxemia, and stabilize hemodynamics to reduce myocardial strain and AF recurrence.

- **Monitoring**: Continuous telemetry in high-risk patients to detect recurrent AF or other arrhythmias.

---

## Prognostic significance

Both AF and troponin elevation in pneumonia portend **worse outcomes**:

- **Mortality**: Higher in-hospital and long-term mortality with new-onset AF or troponin elevation.

- **Cardiovascular complications**: Increased risk of heart failure, stroke, and recurrent AF.

- **Length of stay**: Longer hospitalization and higher resource utilization.

---

Pneumonia can **exacerbate AF** and cause **significant troponin elevation** through hypoxia, inflammation, and autonomic effects; these changes are common, clinically meaningful, and associated with worse outcomes. Management should address both the arrhythmia and the underlying infection to improve prognosis.

### Interpreting troponin elevations: do we need multiple diagnoses? [^346f1238]. European Heart Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Our example patient was admitted to the medical intensive care unit with shortness of breath due to acute pneumonia complicating severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). A transient elevation of troponin to a level three times the upper limits of normal occurred following a period of hypotension and hypoxia while he was septic. He had constant diffuse chest pains since he first felt ill, and his ECG showed atrial fibrillation with lateral T wave inversion, unchanged from prior ECGs. His shortness of breath was attributed to his pulmonary disease, and no coronary intervention performed. He recovered to where he could be discharged, and further cardiac evaluation was deferred to the discretion of his primary care provider following further recovery from his acute illness. The problem is how best to describe the episode for purposes of documentation and subsequent follow-up.

There is no ICD-9 code to document myocardial injury (as evidenced by transient elevations in cardiac biomarkers) that occurs because of severe extra-cardiac problems such as sepsis, but according to the new Universal Definition of MI, this can be called a TYPE 2 MI. Having this diagnosis available is a definitive improvement compared with the 2000 ESC/ACC consensus on redefinition of MI. The 2000 document stated that 'any amount of myocardial necrosis caused by ischaemia should be labeled as MI'. This statement implied that a typical rise and fall of troponin alone was adequate to make the diagnosis of acute, evolving, or recent MI. In the final (2000) summary, it was stated that the rise and fall in biomarkers should be accompanied by at least one additional finding (symptoms, ECG changes, or imaging findings as noted above). However, this inconsistency left an open question as to when a transient biomarker elevation such as that just described constitutes an MI, and what to label it if it is not an MI.

### Identifying survivors of sepsis at risk for adverse cardiovascular outcomes [^0cfaa853]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

For many years, infections have been recognized as precipitants of incident cardiovascular disease. Several epidemiologic studies have reported higher long-term risk of heart failure, myocardial infarction, stroke, coronary revascularization, and atrial fibrillation after viral illness, pneumonia, and sepsis. The mechanisms underlying the increased risk of cardiovascular disease after sepsis remain incompletely understood, and point-of-care approaches to identify high-risk patients who may benefit from targeted interventions are appealing and much needed.

In this issue of the Journal, Garcia and colleagues (pp.) analyzed the association between serum troponin levels and 1-year cardiovascular events in a multicenter cohort of 14,046 adult survivors of sepsis hospitalization who had no prior cardiovascular diagnosis. Patients were categorized into three tertiles based on peak troponin levels measured within the first 14 days of hospital admission, and their association with a composite cardiovascular outcome of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (defined as acute myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, or coronary revascularization), acute heart failure, and atrial fibrillation was assessed. Among the 14,046 patients included in the primary analysis, 6,403 (45.6%) had an elevated troponin level. In unadjusted and multivariable analysis, elevated troponin levels were associated with a "dose-dependent" risk increase in incident cardiovascular events that ranged from 1.37-fold (95% confidence interval, 1.2–1.55) for the lowest tertile to 1.77-fold (95% confidence interval, 1.56–2.00) in the highest tertile. These findings remained robust across multiple sensitivity analyses that included using only patients without missing data (i.e. complete cases), using different imputation strategies for missing data, using troponin as a continuous variable instead of a priori defined tertiles, and exclusion of cardiovascular events that occurred during hospitalization. In addition, the authors used eValues to assess the potential effect of unmeasured confounders. For example, the eValue for the association of peak troponin in the highest tertile and 1-year cardiovascular events was 2.94, indicating that residual confounding could explain the observed association only if there existed an unmeasured covariate with a relative risk association of at least 2.94.

Confounders or contributors in suspected COPD exacerbation — COPD exacerbations are usually associated with increased airway inflammation, increased mucus production and marked gas trapping, with increased dyspnea as the key symptom and other symptoms including increased sputum purulence and volume, together with increased cough and wheeze; however, patients with COPD are at increased risk of other acute events, particularly decompensated heart failure, pneumonia, pulmonary embolism that may also mimic or aggravate an ECOPD, so worsening of respiratory symptoms, particularly dyspnea without the classic characteristics of ECOPD, should prompt careful consideration and/or search of those potential confounders, or contributors. Figure 4.1 lists conditions and suggested tests: most frequent — pneumonia (Chest radiograph), pulmonary embolism (Clinical probability assessment [Hemoptysis, surgery, fracture, history of cancer, DVT]; D-dimer; CT angiography for pulmonary embolism), and heart failure (Chest radiograph; NT-Pro-Brain Natriuretic Peptide [Pro-BNP] and BNP; Echocardiography); less frequent — pneumothorax, pleural effusion (Chest radiograph; Thoracic ultrasound) and myocardial infarction and/or cardiac arrhythmias (atrial fibrillation/flutter) (Electrocardiography; Troponin).

### Narrative review: alternative causes for elevated cardiac troponin levels when acute coronary syndromes are excluded [^3aaf4912]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Current guidelines for the diagnosis of non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction are largely based on an elevated troponin level. While this rapid and sensitive blood test is certainly valuable in the appropriate setting, its widespread use in a variety of clinical scenarios may lead to the detection of troponin elevation in the absence of thrombotic acute coronary syndromes. Many diseases, such as sepsis, hypovolemia, atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, pulmonary embolism, myocarditis, myocardial contusion, and renal failure, can be associated with an increase in troponin level. These elevations may arise from various causes other than thrombotic coronary artery occlusion. Given the lack of any supportive data at present, patients with nonthrombotic troponin elevation should not be treated with antithrombotic and antiplatelet agents. Rather, the underlying cause of the troponin elevation should be targeted. However, troponin elevation in the absence of thrombotic acute coronary syndromes still retains prognostic value. Thus, cardiac troponin elevations are common in numerous disease states and do not necessarily indicate the presence of a thrombotic acute coronary syndrome. While troponin is a sensitive biomarker to "rule out" non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, it is less useful to "rule in" this event because it may lack specificity for acute coronary syndromes.

### Knowledge gaps in the perioperative management of adults with obstructive sleep apnea and obesity hypoventilation syndrome. An official American Thoracic Society workshop report [^b912ae05]. Annals of the American Thoracic Society (2018). Medium credibility.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) perioperative outcomes — candidate endpoints for observational studies or clinical trials include pulmonary complications (acute respiratory failure, reintubation, pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, prolonged mechanical ventilation, desaturation), cardiac complications (arrhythmias including atrial fibrillation, heart failure, cardiac arrest, myocardial infarction), biomarkers (troponin), and clinical outcomes (mortality, hospital length of stay, medical emergency team responses, ICU admission, ICU length of stay, health care costs, health care utilization). Postoperative atrial fibrillation in cardiothoracic surgery is common even up to 30 days postoperatively, and approximately 9% of patients have asymptomatic troponin elevations after noncardiac surgery; increased postoperative troponins are associated with complications and 30-day mortality, supporting that troponin and other cardiac biomarkers may be useful intermediate outcomes perioperatively.

### Cardiac injury associated with severe disease or ICU admission and death in hospitalized patients with COVID-19: a meta-analysis and systematic review [^c9d01302]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

The etiology of cardiac dysfunction may be multifactorial and related to infective myocarditis and/or ischemia. Pathological findings suggested a few interstitial mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates in the myocardial interstitial. Viral invasion may cause direct cardiac injury, and COVID-19-induced cytokine storm may also have toxic effects on the myocardium. Cytokine storm may play a role in the development of ARDS and fulminant myocarditis. In our analysis, 3 studies reported the laboratory findings of IL-6 levels in 526 patients. IL-6 levels were significantly higher in the severe disease/ICU groups than non-severe disease/non-ICU groups, as well as in non-survivors than in survivors. Cardiac involvement reportedly occurred a few days after the influenza syndrome, suggesting the mechanisms of a potential myocyte dissemination of the virus activating the immune system, eventually leading to the onset of heart failure. A study reported that, compared to survivors, non-survivors had increased concentrations of C-reactive protein, decreased lymphocyte counts, and significantly reduced numbers of CD3 + CD8 + T cells, resulting in an immune response. Anti-IL-6, as a drug targeting cytokine pathway and based on its mechanism of action, has potential benefits in COVID-19-related ARDS and pneumonia.

Arrhythmia

Our analysis also found that the patients with emerging arrhythmia are at a higher risk of developing severe disease or requiring ICU admission. In a study of 41 patients with COVID-19, atrial fibrillation occurred in 2 of 3 severe and critical patients with tachycardia, with a peak heart rate of 160 bpm. Newly occurring arrhythmias are often closely related to cardiac injury. The incidence of ventricular arrhythmias (VT/VF) among 187 patients with COVID-19 was 5.9%, primarily affecting those with elevated cardiac troponin levels. One study reported that 5 of 6 acute myocardial injury patients had more than two kinds of ECG abnormalities, including ST-T/Q curve abnormality, atrioventricular block, and arrhythmia. Severe pneumonia increases the resistance of the pulmonary circulation, increasing the pressure of the right atrium, and leading to atrial tachyarrhythmia. Antiviral drugs such as hydroxychloroquine may also prolong the QT interval. Alternatively, the virus directly damages the myocardium and the cardiac conduction system, causing multiple ventricular premature and atrioventricular block. More attention is needed on arrhythmia among severe disease/ICU admission COVID-19 patients. However, in the studies reviewed here, ECG or echocardiography was rarely performed and the occurrence of arrhythmia was rarely reported.

### Association of troponin levels with mortality in Italian patients hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019: results of a multicenter study [^d21d5021]. JAMA Cardiology (2020). High credibility.

Importance

Myocardial injury, detected by elevated plasma troponin levels, has been associated with mortality in patients hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, the initial data were reported from single-center or 2-center studies in Chinese populations. Compared with these patients, European and US patients are older, with more comorbidities and higher mortality rates.

Objective

To evaluate the prevalence and prognostic value of myocardial injury, detected by elevated plasma troponin levels, in a large population of White Italian patients with COVID-19.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This is a multicenter, cross-sectional study enrolling consecutive patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 who were hospitalized in 13 Italian cardiology units from March 1 to April 9, 2020. Patients admitted for acute coronary syndrome were excluded. Elevated troponin levels were defined as values greater than the 99th percentile of normal values.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Clinical characteristics and outcomes stratified as elevated or normal cardiac troponin levels at admission, defined as troponin T or troponin I at a level greater than the 99th percentile of normal values.

Results

A total of 614 patients with COVID-19 were included in this study (mean age [SD], 67 [13] years; 70.8% male), of whom 148 patients (24.1%) died during the hospitalization. Elevated troponin levels were found in 278 patients (45.3%). These patients were older (mean [SD] age, 64.0 [13.6] years vs 71.3 [12.0] years; P < .001) and had higher prevalence of hypertension (168 patients [50.5%] vs 182 patients [65.9%]; P < .001), heart failure (24 [7.2%]; 63 [22.8%]; P < .001), coronary artery disease (50 [15.0%] vs 87 [31.5%]; P < .001), and atrial fibrillation (33 [9.9%] vs 67 [24.3%]; P < .001). Elevated troponin levels were associated with an increased in-hospital mortality (37% vs 13%; HR, 1.71 [95% CI, 1.13–2.59]; P = 0.01 via multivariable Cox regression analysis), and this was independent from concomitant cardiac disease. Elevated troponin levels were also associated with a higher risk of in-hospital complications: heart failure (44 patients [19.2%] vs 7 patients [2.9%]; P < .001), sepsis (31 [11.7%] vs 21 [6.4%]; P = 0.03), acute kidney failure (41 [20.8%] vs 13 [6.2%]; P < .001), multiorgan failure (21 [10.9%] vs 6 [2.9%]; P = 0.003), pulmonary embolism (27 [9.9%] vs 17 [5.2%]; P = 0.04), delirium (13 [6.8%] vs 3 [1.5%]; P = 0.02), and major bleeding (16 [7.0%] vs 4 [1.6%]; P = 0.008).

Conclusions and Relevance

In this multicenter, cross-sectional study of Italian patients with COVID-19, elevated troponin was an independent variable associated with in-hospital mortality and a greater risk of cardiovascular and noncardiovascular complications during a hospitalization for COVID-19.

### Admission cardiac diagnostic testing with electrocardiography and troponin measurement prognosticates increased 30-day mortality in COVID-19 [^8a96643c]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Cardiovascular involvement in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) is common and leads to worsened mortality. Diagnostic cardiovascular studies may be helpful for resource appropriation and identifying patients at increased risk for death.

Methods and Results

We analyzed 887 patients (aged 64 ± 17 years) admitted with COVID‐19 from March 1 to April 3, 2020 in New York City with 12 lead electrocardiography within 2 days of diagnosis. Demographics, comorbidities, and laboratory testing, including high sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs‐cTnT), were abstracted. At 30 days follow‐up, 556 patients (63%) were living without requiring mechanical ventilation, 123 (14%) were living and required mechanical ventilation, and 203 (23%) had expired. Electrocardiography findings included atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter (AF/AFL) in 46 (5%) and ST‐T wave changes in 306 (38%). 27 (59%) patients with AF/AFL expired as compared to 181 (21%) of 841 with other non‐life‐threatening rhythms (P < 0.001). Multivariable analysis incorporating age, comorbidities, AF/AFL, QRS abnormalities, and ST‐T wave changes, and initial hs‐cTnT ≥ 20 ng/L showed that increased age (HR 1.04/year), elevated hs‐cTnT (HR 4.57), AF/AFL (HR 2.07), and a history of coronary artery disease (HR 1.56) and active cancer (HR 1.87) were associated with increased mortality.

Conclusions

Myocardial injury with hs‐cTnT ≥ 20 ng/L, in addition to cardiac conduction perturbations, especially AF/AFL, upon hospital admission for COVID‐19 infection is associated with markedly increased risk for mortality than either diagnostic abnormality alone.

### Atrial fibrillation in patients hospitalized with COVID-19: incidence, predictors, outcomes, and comparison to influenza [^5765dd67]. JACC: Clinical Electrophysiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The goal of this study is to determine the incidence, predictors, and outcomes of atrial fibrillation (AF) or atrial flutter (AFL) in patients hospitalized with coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19).

Background

COVID-19 results in increased inflammatory markers previously associated with atrial arrhythmias. However, little is known about their incidence or specificity in COVID-19 or their association with outcomes.

Methods

This is a retrospective analysis of 3,970 patients admitted with polymerase chain reaction-positive COVID-19 between February 4 and April 22, 2020, with manual review performed of 1,110. The comparator arm included 1,420 patients with influenza hospitalized between January 1, 2017, and January 1, 2020.

Results

Among 3,970 inpatients with COVID-19, the incidence of AF/AFL was 10% (n = 375) and in patients without a history of atrial arrhythmias it was 4% (n = 146). Patients with new-onset AF/AFL were older with increased inflammatory markers including interleukin 6 (93 vs. 68 pg/ml; p < 0.01), and more myocardial injury (troponin-I: 0.2 vs. 0.06 ng/ml; p < 0.01). AF and AFL were associated with increased mortality (46% vs. 26%; p < 0.01). Manual review captured a somewhat higher incidence of AF/AFL (13%, n = 140). Compared to inpatients with COVID-19, patients with influenza (n = 1,420) had similar rates of AF/AFL (12%, n = 163) but lower mortality. The presence of AF/AFL correlated with similarly increased mortality in both COVID-19 (relative risk: 1.77) and influenza (relative risk: 1.78).

Conclusions

AF/AFL occurs in a subset of patients hospitalized with either COVID-19 or influenza and is associated with inflammation and disease severity in both infections. The incidence and associated increase in mortality in both cohorts suggests that AF/AFL is not specific to COVID-19, but is rather a generalized response to the systemic inflammation of severe viral illnesses.

Conclusions Myocardial injury with hs-cTnT ≥ 20 ng/L, in addition to cardiac conduction perturbations, especially AF/AFL, upon hospital admission for COVID-19 infection is associated with markedly increased risk for mortality than either diagnostic abnormality alone.

### Prevalence and impact of myocardial injury in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 infection [^27e4d697]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The degree of myocardial injury, as reflected by troponin elevation, and associated outcomes among U.S. hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) are unknown.

Objectives

The purpose of this study was to describe the degree of myocardial injury and associated outcomes in a large hospitalized cohort with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19.

Methods

Patients with COVID-19 admitted to 1 of 5 Mount Sinai Health System hospitals in New York City between February 27, 2020, and April 12, 2020, with troponin-I (normal value < 0.03 ng/ml) measured within 24 h of admission were included (n = 2,736). Demographics, medical histories, admission laboratory results, and outcomes were captured from the hospitals' electronic health records.

Results

The median age was 66.4 years, with 59.6% men. Cardiovascular disease (CVD), including coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and heart failure, was more prevalent in patients with higher troponin concentrations, as were hypertension and diabetes. A total of 506 (18.5%) patients died during hospitalization. In all, 985 (36%) patients had elevated troponin concentrations. After adjusting for disease severity and relevant clinical factors, even small amounts of myocardial injury (e.g., troponin I > 0.03 to 0.09 ng/ml; n = 455; 16.6%) were significantly associated with death (adjusted hazard ratio: 1.75; 95% CI: 1.37 to 2.24; p < 0.001) while greater amounts (e.g., troponin I > 0.09 ng/dl; n = 530; 19.4%) were significantly associated with higher risk (adjusted HR: 3.03; 95% CI: 2.42 to 3.80; p < 0.001).

Conclusions

Myocardial injury is prevalent among patients hospitalized with COVID-19; however, troponin concentrations were generally present at low levels. Patients with CVD are more likely to have myocardial injury than patients without CVD. Troponin elevation among patients hospitalized with COVID-19 is associated with higher risk of mortality.

### Potential effects of coronaviruses on the cardiovascular system: a review [^9a8cd944]. JAMA Cardiology (2020). High credibility.

Importance

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has reached a pandemic level. Coronaviruses are known to affect the cardiovascular system. We review the basics of coronaviruses, with a focus on COVID-19, along with their effects on the cardiovascular system.

Observations

Coronavirus disease 2019 can cause a viral pneumonia with additional extrapulmonary manifestations and complications. A large proportion of patients have underlying cardiovascular disease and/or cardiac risk factors. Factors associated with mortality include male sex, advanced age, and presence of comorbidities including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular diseases, and cerebrovascular diseases. Acute cardiac injury determined by elevated high-sensitivity troponin levels is commonly observed in severe cases and is strongly associated with mortality. Acute respiratory distress syndrome is also strongly associated with mortality.

Conclusions and Relevance

Coronavirus disease 2019 is associated with a high inflammatory burden that can induce vascular inflammation, myocarditis, and cardiac arrhythmias. Extensive efforts are underway to find specific vaccines and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2. Meanwhile, cardiovascular risk factors and conditions should be judiciously controlled per evidence-based guidelines.

### Thromboembolic risk in patients with pneumonia and new-onset atrial fibrillation not receiving anticoagulation therapy [^0ea5d022]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Potential Explanations and Clinical Implications

Several mechanisms explain why infections can trigger AF, including systemic inflammation, electrophysiological disturbances, metabolic imbalances, hypoxia, and dysvolemia. New-onset AF after pneumonia may identify a subset of patients who have a substrate for thromboembolism regardless of the arrhythmia. A key finding of our study was that the AF episode was not a transient, self-limited event, because approximately one-third of patients had a new hospital AF diagnosis during follow-up. This corroborates previous findings, and suggests that restoration of sinus rhythm with resolution of infection may not protect against AF recurrence. In this respect, infection may merely be a stress test that demonstrates the likelihood for future AF. The substantial observed risk of recurrent AF suggests that individuals with new-onset AF in the context of pneumonia may have underlying predisposition to AF. Indeed, patients with AF in our cohort were older and had a high prevalence of comorbidities, both associated with high risk of AF and thromboembolism.

### Elevated troponin in patients with coronavirus disease 2019: possible mechanisms [^312cce6c]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2020). Medium credibility.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a pandemic that has affected more than 1.8 million people worldwide, overwhelmed health care systems owing to the high proportion of critical presentations, and resulted in more than 100,000 deaths. Since the first data analyses in China, elevated cardiac troponin has been noted in a substantial proportion of patients, implicating myocardial injury as a possible pathogenic mechanism contributing to severe illness and mortality. Accordingly, high troponin levels are associated with increased mortality in patients with COVID-19. This brief review explores the available evidence regarding the association between COVID-19 and myocardial injury.

### Risk factors for major cardiovascular events in adult sepsis survivors: a population-based cohort study [^fff5f5b7]. Critical Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To describe risk factors for major cardiovascular events in adults following hospital discharge after sepsis.

Design

Population-based cohort study.

Setting

Ontario, Canada (2008–2017).

Patients

Adult patients (age 18 yr or older) who survived a first sepsis hospitalization without preexisting cardiovascular disease.

Interventions

None.

Measurements and Main Results

The primary composite outcome was myocardial infarction, stroke, or cardiovascular death up to 5 years following hospital discharge. We used cause-specific Cox proportional hazards models that accounted for the competing risk of noncardiovascular death to describe factors associated with major cardiovascular events. We identified 268,259 adult patients without cardiovascular disease (median age, 72 yr), of whom 10.4% experienced a major cardiovascular event during a median follow-up of 3 years. After multivariable adjustment, age (hazard ratio [HR], 1.53 for every 10 yr; 95% CI, 1.51–1.54), male sex (HR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.20–1.26), diabetes mellitus (HR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.21–1.27), hypertension (HR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.30–1.38), prevalent atrial fibrillation (HR, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.40–1.52), and chronic kidney disease (HR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.06–1.16) were associated with major cardiovascular events during long-term follow-up. Sepsis characteristics such as site of infection (pneumonia vs other: HR, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.05–1.12), septic shock (HR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.05–1.11), and renal replacement therapy (HR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.38–1.64) were also associated with subsequent cardiovascular events. In an analysis restricting to patients with troponin values measured during the hospitalization (26,400 patients), an elevated troponin was also associated with subsequent cardiovascular events (HR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.13–1.33).

Conclusions

Classic cardiovascular risk factors, comorbid conditions, and characteristics of the sepsis episode were associated with a higher hazard of major cardiovascular events in adult sepsis survivors. These findings may inform enrichment strategies for future studies.

### Systemic inflammation induced by exacerbation of COPD or pneumonia in patients with COPD induces cardiac troponin elevation [^5017e2ae]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterised by an irreversible limitation of airflow that is usually progressive. A large proportion of patients experience periods with acute exacerbation of COPD symptoms (AECOPD) frequently triggered by airway infections and characterised by local airway and/or systemic inflammation.COPD is also accompanied by several comorbidities that may represent major health problems for patients. In particular, cardiovascular diseases are common and associated with increased mortality in patients with COPD. Previous studies have shown that a circulatory marker of myocardial damage, cardiac troponin (cTn), is an independent prognostic marker of mortality in the general population, in patients with stable COPD, and after AECOPD. The level of cTn has been shown to be inversely related to COPD severity as assessed by spirometry in the stable state. Moreover, the level of cTn has been reported to be higher in patients hospitalised for AECOPD than in patients with COPD in the stable state. However, prospective studies that examine the trajectory of cTn during the course of COPD are lacking, and whether myocardial damage, as indicated by cTn, progresses during an exacerbated state of COPD has not been determined. Furthermore, the mechanisms that may contribute to elevations in cTn have not been established. We conducted a longitudinal study of cTn in patients with COPD and healthy individuals for 5 years. As our laboratory uses the T-isomere of cTn, we chose T-isomere of cTn as our outcome parameter.

The primary aim of the present study was to test the hypothesis that the cTnT level increases during incident severe AECOPD compared with stable COPD. We also aimed to assess the effect of other hospitalisations on the cTnT level and to elucidate possible mechanism(s) for any increase in cTnT.

### Cardiovascular manifestations in severe and critical patients with COVID-19 [^bf8ec5a2]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) could cause virulent infection leading to Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)-related pneumonia as well as multiple organ injuries.

Hypothesis

COVID-19 infection may result in cardiovascular manifestations leading to worse clinical outcome.

Methods

Fifty four severe and critical patients with confirmed COVID-19 were enrolled. Risk factors predicting the severity of COVID-19 were analyzed.

Results

Of the 54 patients (56.1 ± 13.5years old, 66.7% male) with COVID-19, 39 were diagnosed as severe and 15 as critical cases. The occurrence of diabetes, the level of D-dimer, inflammatory and cardiac markers in critical cases were significantly higher. Troponin I (TnI) elevation occurred in 42.6% of all the severe and critical patients. Three patients experienced hypotension at admission and were all diagnosed as critical cases consequently. Hypotension was found in one severe case and seven critical cases during hospitalization. Sinus tachycardia is the most common type of arrythmia and was observed in 23 severe patients and all the critical patients. Atrioventricular block and ventricular tachycardia were observed in critical patients at end stage while bradycardia and atrial fibrillation were less common. Mild pericardial effusion was observed in one severe case and five critical cases. Three critical cases suffered new onset of heart failure. Hypotension during treatment, severe myocardial injury and pericardial effusion were independent risk factors predicting the critical status of COVID-19 infection.

Conclusion

This study has systemically observed the impact of COVID-19 on cardiovascular system, including myocardial injury, blood pressure, arrythmia and cardiac function in severe and critical cases. Monitoring of vital signs and cardiac function of COVID-19 patients and applying potential interventions especially for those with hypotension during treatment, severe myocardial injury or pericardial effusion, is of vital importance.

### Admission cardiac diagnostic testing with electrocardiography and troponin measurement prognosticates increased 30-day mortality in COVID-19 [^6a635957]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The heart is a unique organ, composed of myofibers, with its own conduction system. COVID‐19 can damage myocardium either through thrombosis leading to ischemia and infarction, or myocarditis through inflammation, but evidently it may also cause cardiac arrhythmias. As found in prior studies, 6, 14 we found a high rate of cardiac injury in hospitalized patients with COVID‐19 as defined by elevated hs‐cTnT. Additionally, we identified a wide range of abnormal ECG findings, including Q wave infarcts, atrial arrhythmias, ectopic beats, and ST and T wave changes, all of which were more commonly present in patients who experienced adverse outcomes. This study suggests that when COVID‐19 adversely affects both myocardium and cardiac conduction together, it is indicative of more profound cardiovascular involvement and is predictive of increased risk for death. Namely, the combination of elevated cardiac troponin and AF/AFL on ECG multivariable modeling was most significantly associated with increased mortality.

The associations between elevated troponin and AF/AFL with adverse outcomes have several possible explanations. First, direct COVID‐19 myocarditis may occur, and case studies have been published of patients with clinically diagnosed COVID‐19‐related myocarditis 15 or myopericarditis. 16 Secondly, the systemic coagulopathy that has been documented in severe COVID‐19 infection could lead to microvascular or epicardial coronary thrombosis. 17 Thirdly, COVID‐19 may result in a stress cardiomyopathy and cardiac injury from systemic inflammation, either as an isolated entity or accompanied by multi‐system organ failure with hypoxemia and shock. Finally, systemic inflammation can also lead to increased sympathetic activation, which may precipitate serious cardiac arrhythmias, such as AF/AFL. As some of these pathways may be targeted with specific therapies, such as anticoagulation or anti‐inflammatory therapy, determining underlying mechanisms remains critical. The pattern of ECG abnormalities may provide important clues to the underlying pathophysiology, such as diffuse ST elevations seen in myocarditis or focal changes that could indicate coronary thrombosis. During the initial phases of the pandemic, overwhelming patient volumes, scare resources, and concern for staff safety has limited the use of advanced cardiovascular imaging in patients with COVID‐19. As we move into the next phase of the pandemic, increased pathologic study by autopsy or endomyocardial biopsy could be combined with more widespread use of cardiovascular imaging with echocardiography, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, and angiography to more fully delineate the pathophysiologic mechanisms responsible for cardiac injury and guide further study and treatment.

### High-sensitivity cardiac troponin and the universal definition of myocardial infarction [^e8d043bd]. Circulation (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In a randomized, controlled trial, we evaluated the effect of implementing a hs-cTnI assay and the recommendations of the Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction on clinical outcomes in consecutive patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome. Whilst the majority of patients had a diagnosis of type 1 myocardial infarction, the introduction of high-sensitivity troponin testing led to a disproportionate increase in the diagnosis of type 2 myocardial infarction and myocardial injury. All patients with myocardial injury or infarction were at increased risk of future myocardial infarction or cardiovascular death, with those with type 1 myocardial infarction at highest risk. Despite modest increases in coronary revascularization and preventative therapies in patients with type 1 myocardial infarction, there was no reduction in future cardiovascular events. In patients with type 2 myocardial infarction or myocardial injury, cardiovascular event rates and future risk was similar to patients with type 1 myocardial infarction, despite a marked increase in noncardiovascular death. Here, we observed no change in cardiovascular investigations or treatments, and outcomes were similarly unchanged.

The observed excess in mortality in patients with type 2 myocardial infarction or myocardial injury is consistent with previous observational studies. Patients with acute myocardial injury were at highest risk of noncardiovascular death, with more than a third occurring within 30 days because of pneumonia, an infective exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or sepsis. In a model attempting to account for this competing risk of noncardiovascular death, patients with type 2 myocardial infarction or myocardial injury had lower rates of cardiovascular events than those with type 1 myocardial infarction. Despite this, 1 in 6 had a myocardial infarction or died from a cardiovascular cause at 1 year; an event rate over 3-fold higher than observed in those without evidence of myocardial injury.

Whilst hs-cTn clearly provides important prognostic information, implementation of testing into practice did not improve outcomes. This may be because in patients with type 2 myocardial infarction or myocardial injury, there is little consensus on how to investigate or treat either group. Even in those with type 1 myocardial infarction, where we have clear guidelines for investigation and treatment, we observed only modest increases in coronary angiography, antiplatelet, or other preventative therapies. This may reflect clinician uncertainty in whether small increases in cardiac troponin are important, and if the benefits of invasive management outweigh the risks in this group. Indeed, our evidence base for the management of myocardial infarction largely predates the introduction of the Universal Definition, when the diagnostic threshold for myocardial infarction was almost 10-fold higher than the threshold implemented in this trial.

### The incidence and impact of atrial fibrillation on hospitalized coronavirus disease-2019 patients [^8ea718f2]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

It is therefore not surprising that we found that COVID‐AF cohort has significantly higher in‐hospital mortality and complication rate, longer LOS, and increased healthcare costs compared to COVID‐non‐AF cohort. The worse outcomes persist after propensity score matching, adjusting for the comorbidities and baseline characteristics of both groups. Our result indicates that AF poses an independent risk for adverse outcomes in COVID‐19 patients. The mechanisms underlying this association are probably multifactorial. First, COVID‐19 triggers an exaggerated immune response, leading to a cytokine storm, which contributes to organ damage and exacerbates the disease severity. AF can not only be precipitated by systemic inflammation and immune dysregulation but also exacerbates these conditions. In COVID patients with AF, the inflammation may be further intensified, leading to a dysregulated immune response, increased vascular permeability, and coagulopathy and contributing to the observed worse outcomes. Second, AF‐related hemodynamic changes, including rapid ventricular rates and loss of atrial contraction, reduce cardiac output and impair cardiac reserve. In the context of respiratory distress and hypoxia with COVID pneumonia, the reduced cardiac reserve in AF patients may exacerbate hypoxemia and organ damage, potentially leading to a higher risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome and other complications. Third, COVID‐19 is associated with endothelial dysfunction and thrombosis, which can cause microvascular and macrovascular complications. AF is also known to promote a prothrombotic state, and the combination of COVID‐19 and AF may result in a synergistic increase in thrombotic eventsand adverse outcomes. Anticoagulation therapy had been suggested in AF patients with high risk of thrombosis. The current recommendation is also in favor of prophylactic‐intensity anticoagulation for patients with COVID‐19‐related critical illness. The thrombotic state and the emphasis on anticoagulation therapy can perhaps explain the increased incidence of cerebrovascular events in COVID‐AF cohort.

It is plausible that the coexistence of AF is a indicator of a state of increased physiological stress, potentially resulting in a more severe hospital course in patients admitted for COVID infection. The clinical implication of such findings in COVID‐AF cohort warrants further study to improve outcome and reduce complications. Identifying COVID‐19 patients with a comorbidity of AF early in their hospitalization allows clinicians to recognize those at higher risk for severe outcomes. Efforts to optimize AF before and during COVID‐19 infection might positively influence patient outcomes.

### Cardiac troponin for assessment of myocardial injury in COVID-19: JACC review topic of the week [^55a94762]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Increases in cardiac troponin indicative of myocardial injury are common in patients with coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) and are associated with adverse outcomes such as arrhythmias and death. These increases are more likely to occur in those with chronic cardiovascular conditions and in those with severe COVID-19 presentations. The increased inflammatory, prothrombotic, and procoagulant responses following severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection increase the risk for acute nonischemic myocardial injury and acute myocardial infarction, particularly type 2 myocardial infarction, because of respiratory failure with hypoxia and hemodynamic instability in critically ill patients. Myocarditis, stress cardiomyopathy, acute heart failure, and direct injury from SARS-CoV-2 are important etiologies, but primary noncardiac conditions, such as pulmonary embolism, critical illness, and sepsis, probably cause more of the myocardial injury. The structured use of serial cardiac troponin has the potential to facilitate risk stratification, help make decisions about when to use imaging, and inform stage categorization and disease phenotyping among hospitalized COVID-19 patients.

### Admission cardiac diagnostic testing with electrocardiography and troponin measurement prognosticates increased 30-day mortality in COVID-19 [^fd2c08c2]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Finally, it is possible that the troponin and AF/AFL seen in this study may be surrogates of more advanced age and pre‐existing cardiovascular comorbidities. We therefore attempted to control for several important comorbidities and age, in addition to ECG categorization and hs‐cTnT, using Cox proportional hazards models. After multivariable adjustment, we found that elevated hs‐cTnT and AF/AFL remained significantly associated with adverse outcomes. As a result, these tests provide important prognostic information, even after controlling for baseline comorbidities, and clearly identify a high‐risk group of patients with COVID‐19 who warrant aggressive monitoring and treatment. It is possible that inclusion of additional laboratory findings, such as other inflammatory markers, renal function, and markers of coagulopathy, into risk models would provide further prognostic accuracy.

Study Limitations

As a retrospective study of an ongoing pandemic, this study has significant limitations. (1) Some patients remain hospitalized and their final outcomes are unknown. The inclusion of 30‐day mortality data helps to reduce the impact of this limitation, but prolonged hospitalizations with severe COVID‐19 are common and some late adverse outcomes may be missed. (2) Patients who are discharged home are assumed to have good outcomes if re‐admission did not occur at our medical center, and it is probable that re‐admissions and adverse outcomes (eg, death) that occur at home or other centers were incompletely captured. (3) Data were abstracted from the medical record, and comorbidities are likely incompletely characterized. (4) This analysis begins at the time of presentation to the hospital, and the timing of the onset of symptoms and the relationship to the time of presentation is not available. (5) This study does not systematically include cardiac imaging findings, which would provide additional clues as to the pathophysiology of cardiac involvement. (6) The analyzed initial ECGs were obtained within 2 days of admission. It is possible that treatment with medications with possible cardiac toxicity and QT prolongation, such as azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine, would have been administered by this time and could affect the ECG results. (7) We excluded patients from the present analysis who did not have ECGs performed within 2 days of admission. It is possible that this may reduce generalizability to all admitted patients with COVID‐19.

### Pneumonia: an arrhythmogenic disease? [^c9f61a1a]. The American Journal of Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Recent studies suggest that there is an increase in cardiovascular disease after pneumonia; however, there is little information on cardiac arrhythmias after pneumonia. The aims of this study were to assess the incidence of, and examine risk factors for, cardiac arrhythmias after hospitalization for pneumonia.

Methods

We conducted a national cohort study using Department of Veterans Affairs administrative data including patients aged ≥ 65 years hospitalized with pneumonia in fiscal years 2002–2007, receiving antibiotics within 48 hours of admission, having no prior diagnosis of a cardiac arrhythmia, and having at least 1 year of Veterans Affairs care. We included only the first pneumonia-related hospitalization, and follow-up was for the 90 days after admission. Cardiac arrhythmias included atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation, cardiac arrest, and symptomatic bradycardia. We used a multilevel regression model, adjusting for hospital of admission, to examine risk factors for cardiac arrhythmias.

Results

We identified 32,689 patients who met the inclusion criteria. Of these, 3919 (12%) had a new diagnosis of cardiac arrhythmia within 90 days of admission. Variables significantly associated with increased risk of cardiac arrhythmia included increasing age, history of congestive heart failure, and a need for mechanical ventilation or vasopressors. Beta-blocker use was associated with a decreased incidence of events.

Conclusion

An important number of patients have new cardiac arrhythmia during and after hospitalization for pneumonia. Additional research is needed to determine whether use of cardioprotective medications will improve outcomes for patients hospitalized with pneumonia. At-risk patients hospitalized with pneumonia should be monitored for cardiac arrhythmias during the hospitalization.

### Fir (e) ing the rhythm: inflammatory cytokines and cardiac arrhythmias [^ea8f06ca]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2023). Medium credibility.

COVID-19, Inflammatory Cytokines, and Cardiac Arrhythmias

The potential clinical relevance of inflammatory cytokines in boosting arrhythmic risk recently has been raising a deal of great general attention due the current pandemic of COVID-19, an acute inflammatory disorder characterized by high-level circulating cytokines along with an unexpected high prevalence of arrhythmic events. Large studies reported an overall prevalence of arrhythmias in COVID-19 ranging from 10% to 20%, an incidence which greatly increases in patients who are severely ill. Supraventricular tachyarrhythmias, especially AF, are the most reported and encompass > 60% of all arrhythmias. The other forms include VAs and bradyarrhythmias/conduction defects, significantly contributing to disease mortality.

Early in the pandemic period, it was believed that COVID-19–associated arrhythmias were mostly the consequence of direct virus-induced cardiac injury and electrophysiological interference of repurposed drugs, such as antimalarials, azithromycin, and protease inhibitors. However, as the knowledge of the disease increased, it became increasingly clear that only rarely does the virus invade the heart. Moreover, arrhythmic risk in patients with COVID-19 persisted to be elevated despite off-label medications that were ever less used because they were not effective. Thus, it became evident that other proarrhythmic factors, less specifically associated with COVID-19, but more generally present in all severe pneumonia regardless of the specific etiology, such as hypoxia caused by respiratory impairment and high-grade systemic inflammation, were most commonly and importantly involved. In this scenario, the discrete impact of inflammatory cytokines on arrhythmogenesis seems to be particularly relevant, also because it is increasingly recognized that a number of patients with COVID-19 (and subjects with non–COVID-19 pneumonia)can develop arrhythmic events, which are also life-threatening, despite no severe respiratory impairment, provided that a significant systemic inflammatory activation was present. Altogether, these findings point to inflammatory cytokines as important drivers of COVID-19–associated arrhythmias, a view supported by several recent clinical studies. Guan et aland Bagnato et alfound that among patients hospitalized with COVID-19, subjects presenting atrial arrhythmias and AF, respectively, had increased IL-6 levels compared to those who did not. These findings were confirmed in a larger retrospective analysis involving 3,970 patients during the hospital stay with COVID-19 in New York City, reported that new-onset AF/atrial flutter occurrence was associated with inflammatory markers, including IL-6, independent of the characteristics at baseline. In another large study involving 965 patients admitted with COVID-19 where an independent association between infection status and QTc prolongation was demonstrated, Rubin et alprovided evidence for a direct correlation between IL-6 levels and QTc maximum. Accordingly, our group demonstrated that in a cohort of patients with active severe COVID-19 and elevated IL-6 blood concentration, QTc was significantly prolonged independent of myocardial injury/strain and QT-prolonging risk factors, but promptly normalized in correlation with IL-6 decrease. Moreover, Hu et alshowed that cytokine storm with rapidly elevated IL-6 associated with SCD among patients with critical COVID-19. Finally, it is well known that obesity is associated with a chronic low-grade inflammatory state, caused by a dysregulated production of IL-6, TNF, and other cytokines by the adipose tissue, along with a higher risk of cardiac arrhythmias and SCD. Cumulative data indicate that in patients with COVID-19 obesity correlates with a pronounced aberrant innate immune reaction and predicts mortality. Thus, it is intriguing to speculate that an exaggerated inflammatory response to the virus could make these subjects particularly susceptible to cytokine-driven arrhythmic events, at least in part accounting for the worst prognosis observed.

### Interpreting troponin elevations: do we need multiple diagnoses? [^4a0702a7]. European Heart Journal (2009). Low credibility.

A descriptive term such as 'secondary MI' would have several advantages over TYPE 2 MI. New, clinically relevant, myocardial dysfunction is often not evident, and the term secondary myocardial injury does not imply significant scarring as does the term MI. Thus, our COPD/pneumonia patient need not be told he had a 'heart attack' as a complication of his pneumonia. Rather, he could be told that his blood tests indicated his heart was under severe stress when he was sick, and (if clinically indicated) follow-up tests may be warranted. In essence, the findings could be treated as a positive cardiac stress test.

Adopting a descriptive approach to the new diagnostic scheme might also help in describing the other proposed categories of MI. As noted by the task force, problems exist when interpreting troponin elevations in other specific clinical settings apart from those patients acutely ill from non-cardiac diseases. Surgical patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass, or patients having elective percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) can have some biomarker elevation even with a very successful procedure. For example, due to micro-emboli in the case of PCI, or direct needle damage to myocardium in the case of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). But damage (usually more severe) can also occur due to dissection of a coronary artery (PCI), graft occlusion (CABG), or other coronary event. As such, criteria are needed to differentiate between relative minor injuries that could be expected even with a successful procedure, from damage indicative of what should clearly be considered an undesirable complication of the procedure (MI).

### Association between troponin I levels during sepsis and postsepsis cardiovascular complications [^ecb07eea]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Rationale: Sepsis commonly results in elevated serum troponin levels and increased risk for postsepsis cardiovascular complications; however, the association between troponin levels during sepsis and cardiovascular complications after sepsis is unclear. Objectives: To evaluate the association between serum troponin levels during sepsis and 1 year after sepsis cardiovascular events. Methods: We analyzed adults aged ⩾40 years without preexisting cardiovascular disease within 5 years, admitted with sepsis across 21 hospitals from 2011 to 2017. Peak serum troponin I levels during sepsis were grouped as normal (≤ 0.04 ng/ml) or tertiles of abnormal (> 0.04 to ≤ 0.09 ng/ml, > 0.09 to ≤ 0.42 ng/ml, or > 0.42 ng/ml). Multivariable adjusted cause-specific Cox proportional hazards models with death as a competing risk were used to assess associations between peak troponin I levels and a composite cardiovascular outcome (atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, atrial fibrillation, and heart failure) in the year following sepsis. Models were adjusted for presepsis and intrasepsis factors considered potential confounders. Measurements and Main Results: Among 14,046 eligible adults with troponin I measured, 2,012 (14.3%) experienced the composite cardiovascular outcome, including 832 (10.9%) patients with normal troponin levels, as compared with 370 (17.3%), 376 (17.6%), and 434 (20.3%) patients within each sequential abnormal troponin tertile, respectively (P < 0.001). Patients within the elevated troponin tertiles had increased risks of adverse cardiovascular events (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] troponin0.04–0.09 = 1.37; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.20–1.55; aHR troponin0.09–0.42 = 1.44; 95% CI, 1.27–1.63; and aHR troponin > 0.42 = 1.77; 95% CI, 1.56–2.00). Conclusions: Among patients without preexisting cardiovascular disease, troponin elevation during sepsis identified patients at increased risk for postsepsis cardiovascular complications. Strategies to mitigate cardiovascular complications among this high-risk subset of patients are warranted.

Heart Rhythm (2020). High credibility.

Impact of COVID-19 on cardiac arrhythmias — patients infected with COVID-19 can exhibit a wide range of clinical manifestations, and in the setting of hypoxemic respiratory failure, ground-glass opacification on chest imaging is found in > 50%; COVID-19 has the potential to cause myocardial injury, with at least 17% found to have an elevated troponin and 23% noted to have heart failure in a study of 191 inpatients from Wuhan, China; cases of fulminant myocarditis with cardiogenic shock and associated atrial and ventricular arrhythmias have been reported; the exact arrhythmic risk in less severe illness or after recovery is currently unknown; improved understanding is critical to guide additional arrhythmia monitoring (eg, mobile cardiac telemetry) after discharge and whether an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) or wearable cardioverter defibrillator will be needed in those with impaired left ventricular function thought to be secondary to COVID-19.

### Admission cardiac diagnostic testing with electrocardiography and troponin measurement prognosticates increased 30-day mortality in COVID-19 [^4c535ed0]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

The first cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2), were diagnosed in Wuhan, China in December 2019. 1 Since that time, COVID‐19 has developed into a pandemic that has been diagnosed in millions of individuals globally with hundreds of thousands of deaths.

COVID‐19 has been shown to be particularly dangerous in older populations and in those with pre‐existing comorbidities, such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, obesity, and pulmonary disease, in populations in China, 2 Italy, 3 and in the United States. 4, 5 The most prominent clinical manifestation of COVID‐19 is pulmonary involvement with the acute respiratory distress syndrome, but there has been increasing recognition that cardiac complications are important contributors to COVID‐19 mortality. 6 In particular, cardiac injury as indicated by elevated troponin levels has been identified as a marker for adverse events, and significant ECG abnormalities, such as ST elevations, heart block, and ventricular tachycardia, have been reported in patients with COVID‐19. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 Implicated pathophysiologic pathways of cardiac involvement of COVID‐19 include myocardial ischemia from epicardial and microvascular coronary thrombosis caused by the hypercoagulable state associated with COVID‐19, demand‐supply mismatching from hypoxemia and shock, systemic inflammation, and direct viral myocardial infiltration leading to myocarditis. 10, 11, 12, 13

Although ECG abnormalities have been reported in small case series, there has not yet been a systematic ECG analysis in a large population of patients with COVID‐19 or a determination that specific arrhythmias confer excess risk. In this study, we aimed to describe the ECG findings that can be used to identify those patients most likely to be have adverse outcomes.

### 2021 ACC / AHA key data elements and definitions for heart failure: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical data standards (writing committee to develop clinical data standards for heart failure) [^0debee40]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2021). High credibility.

ACC/AHA heart failure data standards — COVID-19–related myocardial injury and arrhythmia definitions specify criteria for classifying events during acute infection. Acute myocardial injury can be diagnosed with "elevation in cardiac troponin and/or with cardiac imaging such as cardiac MRI, without any evidence of decline in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), with no evidence of obstructive coronary artery disease or without clinical or electrocardiographic evidence of acute coronary syndrome presentation during acute COVID-19 infection"; additional patterns include the same criteria "with evidence of a decline in LVEF", a right ventricular (RV) variant "with evidence of a decline in RV function", and an acute coronary syndrome presentation requiring "elevation in cardiac troponin, along with clinical presentation suggestive of acute coronary syndrome with chest pain and electrocardiographic changes during acute COVID-19 infection". Arrhythmia elements are defined as "Persistent sinus tachycardia with COVID-19 infection that cannot be explained by the degree of hypoxia, hypotension, fever, or anemia during acute COVID-19 infection", ventricular arrhythmias as "PVCs, ventricular tachycardia, or ventricular fibrillation during acute COVID-19 infection", and atrial tachyarrhythmias as "Atrial flutter or atrial fibrillation during acute COVID-19 infection".

### Systemic inflammation induced by exacerbation of COPD or pneumonia in patients with COPD induces cardiac troponin elevation [^aa5696f2]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2021). High credibility.

Background

Troponin is a biomarker of myocardial injury. In chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), troponin is an important determinant of mortality after acute exacerbation. Whether acute exacerbation of COPD (AECOPD) causes troponin elevation is not known. Here, we investigated whether troponin is increased in AECOPD compared to stable COPD.

Methods

We included 320 patients with COPD in the stable state and 63 random individuals from Akershus University hospital's catchment area. All participants were ≥ 40 years old (mean 65·1 years, SD 7·6) and 176 (46%) were females. The geometric mean of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT) was 6·9 ng/L (geometric-SD 2·6). They were followed regarding hospital admission for the subsequent 5 years.

Results

During the 5-year follow-up, we noted 474 hospitalisations: Totally, 150 and 80 admissions were due to AECOPD or pneumonia, respectively. The geometric mean ratio with geometric SE (GSE) between cTnT at admission and stable state in AECOPD and pneumonia was 1·27 (GSE = 1.11, p = 0·023) and 1·28 (GSE = 1.14, p = 0·054), respectively. After inclusion of blood leucocyte count and C reactive protein at hospitalisation, these ratios attenuated to zero. However, we estimated an indirect of AECOPD and pneumonia on the ratio between hs-cTnT at admission and the stable state to 1·16 (p = 0·022) and 1·22 (p = 0·008), representing 91% (95% CI 82% to 100%) and 95% (95% CI 83% to 100%) of the total effects, respectively.

Conclusion

AECOPD and pneumonia in patients with COPD is associated with higher cTnT levels. This association appears to be mediated by systemic inflammation.

### Systemic inflammation induced by exacerbation of COPD or pneumonia in patients with COPD induces cardiac troponin elevation [^39583a3f]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2021). High credibility.

Discussion

In this study, we found that AECOPD and pneumonia may elevate cTnT indirectly by increasing systemic inflammation. We also found the same effect for non-respiratory infections.

To the best of our knowledge, a positive association between indices of systemic inflammation that is induced by AECOPD or pneumonia, that is, airways inflammation, and myocardial injury has not been described before.

The main strength of this study is that patients were enrolled in stable state, and that diagnoses at hospital admission were made without any knowledge about their state at inclusion. Moreover, in the majority of the patients hospitalised for exacerbation and pneumonia measurements of troponin was available.

Because the association between AECOPD and pneumonia with hs-cTnT attenuated substantially after inclusion of leucocytes and CRP as covariates, one may wonder whether leucocytes and CRP should be regarded as confounders of the relationship between AECOPD and cTnT. However, we think a causal relationship exists between AECOPD and the increase in leucocytes and CRP. Therefore, leucocytes and CRP should be regarded as mediators, not as confounders, of the relationship between AECOPD and troponin elevation. We think these considerations also encompass pneumonia insofar as the total effect of pneumonia on cTnT elevation was the same as that of AECOPD. The p value for pneumonia was lower than the p value for AECOPD mostly because of fewer pneumonia events relative to AECOPD. Moreover, the distinction between pneumonia and AECOPD in patients with COPD is not clear.

As the increase in leucocytes in AECOPD and pneumonia reflects an effect of airway inflammation on the bone marrow, and the increase in CRP is caused by cytokines produced by circulating granulocytes, we regard the joint effect of leucocytes and CRP in these events as a systemic effect of AECOPD and pneumonia. Furthermore, systemic inflammation may increase cTn, particularly in severe infections. This is in agreement with our findings regarding non-respiratory infections. On the other hand, circulatory diseases were weakly associated with leucocytes and CRP, and the cTnT level in this group was nearly unchanged after inclusion of leucocytes and CRP as covariates. Thus, the cTnT elevation was likely a direct consequence of myocardial disease.

The clinical implication of our finding is that reduction of systemic inflammation be given more focus in the treatment of COPD.

Heart rate was also positively associated with troponin elevation, but not with AECOPD or pneumonia, and removal did not change the relationship between AECOPD or pneumonia and troponin. Thus, the confounding effect of heart rate was negligible and it was not a mediator the relationship between AECOPD or pneumonia and troponin.

We also noted that we did not find any association between troponin and hypoxaemia. This is in agreement with two other previous cohorts. As in our previous studies, we did not have information on oxygen tension in the patients prior to admission. Moreover, it could also be explained by insufficient number of patient. Therefore, we cannot exclude hypoxaemia as a putative contributor of troponin elevation at admission.

Several studies have reported that troponin elevation is associated with the severity of stable COPD and that troponin elevation is associated with an unfavourable prognosis after COPD exacerbation and in the stable state. The relationship between AECOPD and increased troponin has been less studied. In a cohort of 98 stable patients with COPD who were followed over several months, 55 patients were investigated in both their stable state and during exacerbation. Among these patients, 24 who had verified an infectious cause of the exacerbation had troponin elevation during the exacerbation. This elevation was most pronounced in patients with concomitant coronary artery disease. In another study, a minority of patients referred to hospital due to AECOPD had elevated cTnT that normalised within 72 hours of admission. However, in the latter study, they had not determined cTnT values in the stable state prior to hospitalisation. Therefore, they could not adjust for cTnT in the stable state prior to admission.

The main limitation of this study was that we did not re-examine the individuals who were not hospitalised during the follow-up, except the LTOT candidates and members of the outpatient rehabilitation group. Therefore, data about the natural course of cTnT in the cohort were sparse. However, this limitation should not distort the results, as we adjusted for follow-up time in the analyses.

In conclusion, systemic inflammation in COPD caused by exacerbation or pneumonia mediates elevation of cTnT.

### Clinical significance of coronavirus disease 2019 in hospitalized patients with myocardial injury [^beb03ab8]. Clinical Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

4.1 Implications for etiology of myocardial injury/Type 2 MI in COVID‐19 positive patients

We found that the hs‐TnI concentrations were broadly similar in the COVID‐19 and non‐COVID‐19 subgroups, although in‐hospital mortality was greater in COVID‐19 positive patients. In the context of COVID‐19, Type 2 MI/Myocardial injury was observed in younger, less co‐morbid patients. Hypoxia, anemia and renal dysfunction are also clearly relevant complications. This is in keeping with emerging autopsy reports of multi‐organ failure due to septic shock with respiratory infection being most common cause of death. 7

There were no instances of tachyarrhythmia documented as the cause of hs‐TnI elevation in the 36 patients with COVID‐19 however three positive patients were noted to have existing atrial fibrillation with a maximum 12‐lead ECG rate of 131 bpm. Since continuous ECG monitoring data were not available, this finding may represent an under‐estimate. In prior studies, arrhythmia may be present in up to 44% of patients with severe illness. Case reports from other pandemic regions have included arrhythmias in the peri‐mortem stage of illness or secondary to hypoxemia mediated conduction deficits. 8, 9 Further information on 12‐lead ECG observations in positive and negative patients is provided in Table S3.

Pericarditis/Myocarditis was recorded as the mechanism of myocardial injury in three patients with COVID‐19. Diagnosis was made on clinical suspicion with ECG changes and cardiac MRI as objective confirmation of diagnosis. Myocarditis in COVID‐19 has been reported previously – although uncommonly – and the results of prospective imaging studies will potentially illuminate the prevalence in surviving patients following COVID‐19 infection. 10

Obesity was the most common co‐morbidity within our cohort, observed among 44.4% of patients with COVID‐19 and Type 2 MI/myocardial injury. Obesity is associated with adverse outcomes in COVID‐19 infection. 11, 12, 13 A combination of increased cardiac demand and abnormalities of diastolic function in combination with hypoventilation in respiratory illness and high prevalence of metabolic disease are likely contributors. 14, 15

Type 2 MI/myocardial injury is associated with increased illness severity as evidenced by significantly higher mortality and duration of hospital stay. 16 Though exact mechanisms of myocardial injury and modifiable outcome in patients with COVID‐19 is yet to be demonstrated, protocolized high‐sensitivity troponin testing and its utilization in stratification could be a useful tool for early recognition of adverse outcome and early decision making in this group. 17

### Characterization of NT-proBNP in a large cohort of COVID-19 patients [^5be460cb]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2021). Medium credibility.

Aims

Extensive research regarding the association of troponin and prognosis in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been performed. However, data regarding natriuretic peptides are scarce. N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) reflects haemodynamic stress and has proven useful for risk stratification in heart failure (HF) and other conditions such as pulmonary embolism and pneumonia. We aimed to adequately characterize NT-proBNP concentrations using a large cohort of patients with COVID-19, and to investigate its association with prognosis.

Methods and Results

Consecutive patients with confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and available NT-proBNP determinations, from March 1st to April 20th, 2020 who completed at least 1-month follow-up or died, were studied. Of 3080 screened patients, a total of 396 (mean age 71.8 ± 14.6years, 61.1% male) fulfilled all the selection criteria and were finally included, with a median follow-up of 53 (18–62) days. Of those, 192 (48.5%) presented NT-proBNP levels above the recommended cut-off for the identification of HF. However, only 47 fulfilled the clinical criteria for the diagnosis of HF. Patients with higher NT-proBNP during admission experienced more frequent bleeding, arrhythmias and HF decompensations. NT-proBNP was associated with mortality both in the whole study population and after excluding patients with HF. A multivariable Cox model confirmed that NT-proBNP was independently associated with mortality after adjusting for all relevant confounders (hazard ratio 1.28, 95% confidence interval 1.13–1.44, per logarithmic unit).

Conclusion

NT-proBNP is frequently elevated in COVID-19. It is strongly and independently associated with mortality after adjusting for relevant confounders, including chronic HF and acute HF. Therefore, its use may improve early prognostic stratification in this condition.

### Canakinumab to reduce deterioration of cardiac and respiratory function in SARS-CoV-2 associated myocardial injury with heightened inflammation (canakinumab in COVID-19 cardiac injury: the three C study) [^b3a4cd40]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

2 METHODS

2.1 Study overview

The three C Study is a prospective, IRB approved, blinded randomized‐controlled Phase II study designed to evaluate whether treatment with canakinumab prevents progressive heart and respiratory failure in patients with Covid‐19 associated myocardial injury and increased inflammation. The trial is enrolling in hospitals across the Cleveland Clinic Health System and is being conducted in compliance with the study protocol, the Declaration of Helsinki, and good clinical practice as defined by the international conference on harmonization. Prior to patient participation, written informed consent will be obtained from each patient or their legally authorized representative. The trial is supported by an investigator‐initiated grant to the primary investigator and the design and conduct approved by the FDA.

2.2 Study population

The three C study plans to enroll a total of 45 patients. The first patient was randomized on 28 April 2020, and the study will be completed in approximately 7 months. Key inclusion and exclusion criteria are summarized in Table 1. In brief, the study will include hospitalized patients with Covid‐19 on standard therapy who have evidence of myocardial injury as well as clinical and biological markers of a heightened inflammatory syndrome. Patients must have a documented upper respiratory tract specimen positive for Covid‐19, a troponin > 99% upper reference range, a NT‐proBNP or BNP greater than upper reference limit, and a CRP > 50 mg/L (> 5 mg/dL). At our hospitals, the fifth generation Roche Troponin T assay is used, and a value ≥ 12 ng/L is considered abnormal. 32 Although the majority of patients will likely have severe pneumonia, defined as tachypnea, severe respiratory distress, or SpO 2 ≤ 93% on room air, because initial myocardial injury in the absence of severe pneumonia has been reported, severe pneumonia is not required for inclusion. Important exclusion criteria include myocardial infarction (MI) according to the fourth universal definition of MI as a cause for the troponin elevation, 33 uncontrolled systemic bacterial infection, mechanical ventilation for greater than 48 hours, or hemodynamic instability requiring mechanical circulatory support.

### The heart in COVID-19: primary target or secondary bystander? [^b43fd513]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2020). Medium credibility.

In the throes of the current coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, interest has burgeoned in the cardiovascular complications of this virulent viral infection. As troponin, a biomarker of cardiac injury, often rises in hospitalized patients, its interpretation and actionability require careful consideration. Fulminant myocarditis due to direct viral infection can certainly occur, but in patients with increased oxygen demands due to tachycardia and fever and reduced oxygen delivery due to hypotension and hypoxemia, COVID-19 disease can cause myocardial injury indirectly. Cytokines released during the acute infection can elicit activation of cells within pre-existing atherosclerotic lesions, augmenting thrombotic risk and risk of ischemic syndromes. Moreover, microvascular activation by cytokines can cause not only myocardial injury but can also harm other organ systems commonly involved in COVID-19 infections including the kidneys. Dealing with the immense challenge of COVID-19, confronted with severely ill patients in dire straits with virtually no rigorous evidence base to guide our therapy, we must call on our clinical skills and judgment. These touchstones can help guide us in selecting patients who might benefit from the advanced imaging and invasive procedures that present enormous logistical challenges in the current context. Lacking a robust evidence base, pathophysiologic reasoning can help guide our choices of therapy for individual clinical scenarios. We must exercise caution and extreme humility, as often plausible interventions fail when tested rigorously. But act today we must, and understanding the multiplicity of mechanisms of myocardial injury in COVID-19 infection will help us meet our mission unsupported by the comfort of strong data.

### Spark that lights the fire: infection triggers cardiovascular events [^cad01aba]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Infections, both acute and chronic, are one of the main triggers of inflammation, thus it is not far‐fetched to hypothesize that infections could also elicit cardiovascular events. This has been demonstrated in the clinical setting given that patients with chronic infections such as Helicobacter pylori 14 also experienced more cardiovascular events. The role of acute infections as triggers for cardiovascular events has been recently investigated. While several recent retrospective clinical observations found an increased incidence of MI after community‐acquired pneumonia (CAP), this was further confirmed by a prospective multicenter cohort of 2344 unselected patients with CAP 2 showing that the 30‐day incidence of heart failure, arrhythmia, and MI was 21%, 10% and 3%, respectively, with this risk peaking in the first 2 days of hospitalization. Additional prospective data in hospitalized CAP patients 15, 16 found even higher MI rates, with half of CAP patients showing high levels of hs‐TnT (High‐sensitivity cardiac Troponin T) while 11% of CAP patients additionally showed electrocardiographic signs of MI and clinical symptoms on top of the high hs‐TnT levels. Of note, this MI incidence of 11% 17 was higher than in previous reports (3% as reported by Corrales‐Medina 2), which is probably explained by the use of hs‐TnT (a more sensitive marker of myocardial injury than the CK (Creatine Kinase) that was used in previous studies 2) and by the fact that the levels of hs‐TnT were measured not only at hospital baseline but also every 12 hours during hospital admission. 2 An analysis of even larger populations (5888 patients in the Cardiovascular Health Study and 15 792 in the ARIC (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities) study confirmed that CAP was associated with increased risk of cardiovascular events. 17 Increased MI risk is not circumscribed to CAP, but it also extends to other types of respiratory infections. Large retrospective epidemiological studies involving > 33 000 patients found an increase in MI risk after acute respiratory infections. 18, 19, 20 This link is further supported because influenza vaccination is associated with a reduced risk of MI and stroke, both in retrospective studies 21 and in clinical trials, 22 and because early treatment of influenza in patients with established CVD was associated with a 60% decrease in the MI risk. 23 Furthermore, the authors of the present article 4 have previously expanded this field by demonstrating that infections do not only increase the risk of MI but also the risk of stroke. 3 Of the utmost importance, infections also increase the risk for heart failure 2, 24 and not only for MI.

### High-sensitivity troponin assays: evidence, indications, and reasonable use [^8edaaf0c]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

Future Directions

The new high‐sensitivity troponin assays may allow clinicians to better stratify risk in other potentially high‐risk populations. However, the utility of troponin testing in these settings is unclear and awaits further investigation. A recent example is atrial fibrillation, which represents an important population of patients with few, if any, useful biomarkers currently available to aid clinical risk stratification. Traditionally, clinical risk scores are used to estimate risk for thromboembolic events in atrial fibrillation; then, anticoagulant medication is considered depending on embolic risk and bleeding risk, medication adherence, etc. Roldan et alfound that in a large cohort of chronic atrial fibrillation patients on oral anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation, high‐sensitivity troponin levels were independently associated with an increased risk for thrombotic and vascular events as well as cardiovascular death. This relationship was maintained even after CHADS 2 (which estimates risk based on the presence of congestive heart failure, hypertension, age ≥ 75 years, diabetes mellitus, and prior stroke or transient ischemic attack) risk factors and HAS‐BLED (defined as hemorrhage involving a critical anatomic site, for example, intracranial, or a bleed requiring hospitalization, transfusion of ≥ 2 units of packed cells, or associated with a decrease in hemoglobin level of ≥ 2 g/L) risk factors were added to the model.

In addition, there are few clinical tools to identify which patients will have recurrent atrial fibrillation. A prospective cohort substudy of GISSI AF (Gruppo Italiano per lo Studio della Sopravvivenza nell'Infarto Miocardico–Atrial Fibrillation), a trial to determine the effects of valsartan on recurrence of atrial fibrillation, studied the utility of several biomarkers to predict recurrent of AF. Over 2‐year follow‐up, high‐sensitivity troponin was independently associated with the recurrence of AF, as were 2 other biomarkers. While high‐sensitivity troponin may add to prognostic information and elevated troponin levels may warrant increased surveillance of high‐risk patients, it remains uncertain whether any therapies might be triggered by this type of risk stratification (eg, prolonged antiarrhythmic medications, atrial fibrillation ablation, or atrial occluder devices).

### Cardiac biomarker-based risk stratification algorithm in patients with severe COVID-19 [^d9063533]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2020). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Cardiac biomarkers like cardiac troponins and natriuretic peptides are elevated in a substantial proportion of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We propose an algorithmic approach using cardiac biomarkers to triage, risk-stratify and prognosticate patients with severe COVID-19.

Methods

We systematically searched the PubMed and Google Scholar databases until May 31st, 2020, and accessed the available data on the role of cardiac biomarkers in patients with COVID-19.

Results

COVID-19 is associated with acute cardiac injury in around 7–28% of patients, significantly increasing its associated complications and mortality. Patients with underlying cardiovascular disease are more prone to develop acute cardiac injury as a result of COVID-19. The use of cardiac biomarkers may aid in differentiating the cardiac cause of dyspnea in patients with severe COVID-19. Cardiac biomarkers may also aid in triaging, risk-stratification, clinical decision-making, and prognostication of patients with COVID-19. However, there are concerns that routine testing in all patients with COVID-19 irrespective of severity, may result in unnecessary downstream investigations which may be misleading. In this brief review, using an algorithmic approach, we have tried to rationalize the use of cardiac biomarkers among patients with severe COVID-19. This approach is also likely to lessen the infection exposure risk to the cardiovascular team attending patients with severe COVID-19.

Conclusion

It appears beneficial to triage, risk-stratify, and prognosticate patients with COVID-19 based on the evidence of myocardial injury and the presence of underlying cardiovascular disease. Future research studies are, however, needed to validate these proposed benefits.

### Incidence, risk factors and outcomes of new-onset atrial fibrillation in patients with sepsis: a systematic review [^06b79bce]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Key messages

New-onset AF is a common complication in critically ill patients with sepsis and its incidence increases with progression of the disease stage.
New-onset AF is independently associated with a risk of stroke, a prolonged length of stay in the ICU, and increased mortality.
Early identification of patients who are at increased risk for developing AF seems feasible and may allow for pharmacological interventions to prevent this complication.

### The association between pneumococcal pneumonia and acute cardiac events [^28d25427]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Increased cardiac stress, hypoxemia, and inflammation may contribute to acute cardiac events, such as myocardial infarction (MI), arrhythmia, and/or congestive heart failure (CHF). We sought to determine the incidence of such events in patients who were hospitalized for community-acquired pneumococcal pneumonia.

Methods

We studied the medical records of all patients who were admitted for pneumococcal pneumonia during a 5-year period (2001–2005) to identify those who had MI, atrial fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia, or new-onset or worsening CHF at the time of hospital admission.

Results

Of 170 patients, 33 (19.4%) had ≥ 1 of these major cardiac events. Twelve had MI, of whom 2 also had arrhythmia and 5 had new-onset or worsening CHF. Eight had new-onset atrial fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia; 6 of these also had new CHF. Thirteen had newly diagnosed or worsening CHF, without MI or new arrhythmias. Hypoxemia and anemia were prominent. Importantly, patients with concurrent pneumococcal pneumonia and cardiac events had a significantly higher mortality than those with pneumococcal pneumonia alone (P < .008). The coexistence of pulmonary and cardiac disease was often overlooked by admitting physicians who, seeking a unifying diagnosis, emphasized one diagnosis to the exclusion of the other.

Conclusions

Patients with pneumococcal pneumonia are at substantial risk for a concurrent acute cardiac event, such as MI, serious arrhythmia, or new or worsening CHF. This concurrence significantly increases mortality due to pneumonia. Admitting physicians tend to seek a unifying diagnosis, but the frequent coexistence of pneumonia and cardiac events indicates the importance of considering multiple diagnoses.

### Antithrombotic therapy in arterial thrombosis and thromboembolism in COVID-19: an American College of Chest Physicians expert panel report [^0eef4a7b]. Chest (2023). High credibility.

COVID-19 and elevated cardiac troponins without acute coronary syndrome (ACS) — clinical context and DAPT considerations: Elevation of cardiac troponins consistent with myocardial injury has been identified in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 with variable frequency (7%-41%), and a systematic review and meta-analysis found that an elevated level of cardiac troponins was associated with a 10-fold increased risk of adverse outcomes in patients with COVID-19; elevated troponins were observed in 42.3% of patients in the ICU with non-COVID-19 acute respiratory disease. Troponin elevation in COVID-19 could result from entities other than acute plaque disruption, including myocarditis, stress cardiomyopathy, acute heart failure, and direct injury from SARS-CoV-2, and a documented increase in the risk of bleeding when dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) is used occurs. In the setting of isolated cardiac troponins elevation, no evidence supports that DAPT would decrease the risk of cardiac events, and potential causes other than ACS should be considered.

### Implementation of a high sensitivity cardiac troponin I assay and risk of myocardial infarction or death at five years: observational analysis of a stepped wedge, cluster randomised controlled trial [^507322a3]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Implications for practice and future research

In practice, myocardial infarction is differentiated from other mechanisms of myocardial injury by the presence of symptoms or signs of myocardial ischaemia, or by definitive cardiac imaging. Patients with an adjudicated diagnosis of myocardial infarction who were reclassified by the high sensitivity assay in standard care, but with the results concealed, may already have been recognised as being at increased risk or in need of further assessment owing to symptoms or electrocardiographic findings. As such, there was perhaps less to gain from recognising these patients as having elevated cardiac troponin levels after high sensitivity testing, unlike those with non-ischaemic myocardial injury that may be silent and only identified by troponin testing.

Cardiac troponin is now widely recognised as a powerful independent prognostic marker in patients without type 1 myocardial infarction across a diverse range of acute cardiac and non-cardiac conditions, such as sepsis, renal failure, pulmonary embolism, heart failure, after surgical interventions, and, more recently, in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. As such, clinicians are perhaps more likely to admit patients with an elevated cardiac troponin level even after the identification of an alternative explanation for their presentation. Consistent with this, we observed that the duration of stay doubled in patients reclassified by the high sensitivity assay. Multiple studies have shown that elevated cardiac troponin concentrations are common in cardiac conditions such as chronic heart failure, stable coronary artery disease, and valvular heart disease. Improved recognition of these conditions after implementation of high sensitivity testing could explain why the greatest reduction in events was observed in those with a cardiac cause of non-ischaemic myocardial injury. Longer hospital stays may have facilitated additional specialist review, and further investigation, such as echocardiography, after myocardial infarction was excluded. Although these investigations were not recorded in the trial database, which captured information on the management of acute coronary syndrome, the diagnosis and subsequent follow-up of other newly recognised cardiac conditions could impact long term outcomes.

### COVID-19 and the heart: an update for clinicians [^e7de8b22]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

The world is facing the challenge of the pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus, SARS‐CoV‐2, which results in a disease syndrome known as Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19). This disease started as an outbreak in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and at May 23, 2020, the virus had spread to 216 countries, areas and territories across the world with 5 103 006 confirmed cases and 333 401 deaths. 1 On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the disease a global pandemic.

The clinical spectrum of COVID‐19 appears to be wide, encompassing asymptomatic infection, mild upper respiratory tract illness and severe viral pneumonia with respiratory failure, systemic inflammatory syndrome and even death. 2 The respiratory tract is the primary target for SARS‐CoV‐2 virus, however cardiovascular involvement has been documented in different studies and the heart is involved in 40% of patients dying from COVID‐19 disease. 3

Cardiovascular complications of influenza and coronavirus infection, including myocarditis, acute myocardial infarction, and exacerbation of heart failure have been documented during previous epidemics with significant impact on both morbidity and mortality. 4 Underlying myocarditis has been described with electrocardiographic changes, troponin elevation, and echocardiographic evidence of diastolic and systolic dysfunction. In previous coronavirus epidemics, adverse outcomes including hypotension, arrhythmia, and sudden cardiac death have been reported in patients with pre‐existing cardiovascular disease. 5

Patients with pre‐existing comorbidities are thought to be at an increased risk of infection with SARS‐CoV2 and also tend to have worse clinical outcomes. Specifically, patients with cardiovascular disease, diabetes and hypertension are thought to have a high complication rate with mortality rate of 10.5% reported in cardiac patients and mortality rates of 7.3% and 6.0% for diabetes and hypertension patients, respectively. 6

Background

Biochemical Cues to Cardiac Involvement in Coronavirus Disease-2019

Approximately 15 months after the World Health Organization declared coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) a pandemic, the global case load exceeds 217 million, with more than 4.5 million deaths worldwide as of September 2021. Although severe respiratory failure is considered the main cause of death, cardiovascular symptoms such as palpitations, dyspnea, fatigue, and chest pain are common both in the subacute and chronic stages of the disease. Additionally, a significant proportion of patients with COVID-19 were found to have biochemical evidence of myocardial injury. Myocardial injury is common in patients with COVID-19, its frequency increases with greater severity of illness, and it carries relevant prognostic information. The first case series reported on clinical outcomes and cardiac involvement in COVID-19 suggested that up to 28% of hospitalized patients had elevated troponin levels. Subsequent studies have reported an association between biochemical evidence of myocardial injury and increased risk for arrhythmic events, extracardiac complications (acute respiratory distress syndrome, mechanical ventilation), and mortality in hospitalized patients. However, the majority of patients with COVID-19 with elevated cardiac enzymes have no underlying epicardial coronary artery occlusion (effectively excluding type 1 myocardial infarction [MI]) or clinical symptoms of a cardiac pathology. This prompted some to propose that COVID-19 predisposes to a nonspecific myocardial injury biomarker leak not indicative of a type 2 MI. Nevertheless, recent autopsy series of patients with COVID-19 have demonstrated venous thromboembolism and pulmonary embolism as frequent findings. The underlying hypercoagulability may contribute to hypoxia or thrombosis, which precipitate organ failure, including sudden ventricular dysfunction and cor pulmonale. Potential mechanisms for myocardial injury engendered by severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) are discussed in detail under "SARS-CoV-2-Related Myocardial Injury".

### Thromboembolic risk in patients with pneumonia and new-onset atrial fibrillation not receiving anticoagulation therapy [^8322b6e5]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Conclusions

Among patients with community-acquired pneumonia, new-onset AF was associated with increased risks of thromboembolism, which may cross the threshold where OAC therapy is considered beneficial. One-third of patients had a new hospital AF diagnosis during follow-up, indicating that the concept of infection-related AF as a transient condition may need reconsideration. These findings may have rhythm monitoring and treatment implications, and improved communication and monitoring of long-term AF risks is warranted.

### Detailed causality between coronavirus disease-2019 and atrial fibrillation [^5856a05a]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Niu et al. investigated the clinical implication of atrial fibrillation (AF) in patients with coronavirus disease‐2019 (COVID‐19). According to their findings, AF was prevalent in patients hospitalized for COVID‐19 and was associated with worse in‐hospital mortality, more disease‐related complication, and increased healthcare utilization. Several concerns have been raised.

COVID‐19 is a systemic inflammatory disease that induces various cardiovascular conditions. AF may be triggered by this inflammatory cascade. Consequently, the presence of AF may be a confounding factor for in‐hospital mortality rather than a prognostic factor. Did the authors observe obvious differences in the severity and inflammatory status of COVID‐19 between those with and without AF?

It is widely acknowledged that AF is a robust predictor of cardiovascular diseases and mortality. Did the authors identify any distinct profiles in individuals who had both COVID‐19 and AF when compared to those with AF alone?

In the authors' study, the incidence of ventricular arrhythmia was higher in individuals with AF. However, the detailed types of ventricular arrhythmia remain uncertain. For instance, did the authors include premature ventricular contractions? It is plausible that the dominant causes of in‐hospital cardiac arrest were ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation. Ventricular fibrillation is often encountered in younger patients with acute coronary syndrome, while extra‐cardiac abnormalities such as anemia and advanced age are associated with pulseless electrical activity. Could the authors provide more clarity on the relationship between COVID‐19, AF, and cardiac arrest?

### The incidence and impact of atrial fibrillation on hospitalized coronavirus disease-2019 patients [^319623f1]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

The Coronavirus disease‐2019 (COVID‐19) pandemic has posed a challenge to healthcare systems worldwide. As researchers continue to understand the intricate interactions between COVID‐19 and various pre‐existing medical conditions, emerging evidence suggests that cardiovascular comorbidities may play a significant role in the clinical course and outcomes of COVID‐19 patients.

Among these comorbidities, atrial fibrillation (AF), one of the most common cardiac arrhythmias, has emerged as a topic of interest in COVID‐19 research. An increasing body of evidence suggests that AF, may play a crucial role in shaping the clinical outcomes of COVID‐19 patients. Several preliminary studies have hinted at a potential bidirectional link between COVID‐19 and AF. One study conducted by Daniel D et al. reported a higher prevalence of AF in severe COVID‐19 cases compared to milder cases. Additionally, recent evidence suggests that COVID‐19 may lead to myocardial injury and contribute to AF initiation or exacerbation. However, the mechanisms underlying this relationship remain largely elusive.

Understanding the impact of AF on COVID‐19 patients is essential for optimizing clinical management strategies. The presence of AF may pose unique challenges for antiviral therapies, immunomodulatory drugs, and anticoagulant regimens used in COVID‐19 treatment. This research paper aims to comprehensively investigate the implications of AF on hospitalized COVID‐19 patients.

### Growth differentiation factor 15 provides prognostic information superior to established cardiovascular and inflammatory biomarkers in unselected patients hospitalized with COVID-19 [^ccce076c]. Circulation (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF-15) is a strong prognostic marker in sepsis and cardiovascular disease (CVD). The prognostic value of GDF-15 in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is unknown.

Methods

Consecutive, hospitalized patients with laboratory-confirmed infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and symptoms of COVID-19 were enrolled in the prospective, observational COVID Mechanisms Study. Biobank samples were collected at baseline, day 3 and day 9. The primary end point was admission to the intensive care unit or death during hospitalization, and the prognostic performance of baseline and serial GDF-15 concentrations were compared with that of established infectious disease and cardiovascular biomarkers.

Results

Of the 123 patients enrolled, 35 (28%) reached the primary end point; these patients were older, more often had diabetes, and had lower oxygen saturations and higher National Early Warning Scores on baseline. Baseline GDF-15 concentrations were elevated (> 95th percentile in age-stratified healthy individuals) in 97 (79%), and higher concentrations were associated with detectable SARS-CoV-2 viremia and hypoxemia (both P < 0.001). Patients reaching the primary end point had higher concentrations of GDF-15 (median, 4225 [IQR, 3197–5972] pg/mL versus median, 2187 [IQR, 1344–3620] pg/mL, P < 0.001). The area under the receiver operating curve was 0.78 (95% CI, 0.70–0.86). The association between GDF-15 and the primary end point persisted after adjusting for age, sex, race, body mass index, estimated glomerular filtration rate, previous myocardial infarction, heart failure, and atrial fibrillation (P < 0.001) and was superior and incremental to interleukin-6, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, ferritin, D-dimer, cardiac troponin T, and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide. Increase in GDF-15 from baseline to day 3 was also greater in patients reaching the primary end point (median, 1208 [IQR, 0–4305] pg/mL versus median, -86 [IQR, -322 to 491] pg/mL, P < 0.001).

Conclusions

GDF-15 is elevated in the majority of patients hospitalized with COVID-19, and higher concentrations are associated with SARS-CoV-2 viremia, hypoxemia, and worse outcome. The prognostic value of GDF-15 was additional and superior to established cardiovascular and inflammatory biomarkers.

### Characteristics and outcome of patients with COVID-19 complicated by Takotsubo cardiomyopathy: case series with literature review [^33427a1d]. Open Heart (2020). Medium credibility.

The exact mechanism of TC is unclear; however, several hypotheses have been proposed. The most widely accepted hypothesis is related to complex systemic responses to acute, severe stress and the response of the cardiovascular system to sudden surges in endogenous or exogenously administered catecholamines. In primary TC, acute cardiac symptoms resulting from emotional or physical stress are the main reason for seeking medical attention. In contrast, secondary TC develops in patients who are hospitalised for other reasons. The intense sympathetic stimulation in these patients caused by the primary condition or its treatment results in the development of TC. Some of the commonly identified triggers for the development of secondary TC are respiratory conditions, intubation, medication use, epinephrine use, anxiety and beta-blocker withdrawal. Many of these triggers are present in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. This could possibly be the explanation for a higher number of reported cases of TC with SARS-CoV-2 compared with other similar respiratory viruses.

Previous observational studies have shown that patients with secondary TC are older, males are more commonly affected than females and they have higher rates of HTN, DM, dyslipidaemia, cerebrovascular disease and cardiac arrhythmia. The same trend was also observed in our series. A similar pattern was also seen in eight cases of TC and COVID-19 described in the literature (table 3). Furthermore, increased risk of life-threatening complications and a 10-fold higher mortality rate as compared with primary TC were also observed in these studies. Hence, early identification of patients with COVID-19 who are at higher risk for developing secondary TC is important for appropriate management and prevention of complications, and thus improved outcomes.

Certain risk factors can be identified from our series and the study of cases described in the literature that predispose patients with COVID-19 to secondary TC. These are older age, presence of HTN, DM, HLD, prior stroke, AF and psychiatric illness, hypoxia and severe COVID-19 pneumonia requiring mechanical ventilatory support. Patients with the above-mentioned risk factors should be considered for closer monitoring on the telemetry floor, and development of new tachycardia or hypotension should be further investigated with ECG and blood work for cardiac biomarkers (troponin and NT-pro-BNP). Any new ECG changes or abnormalities in cardiac biomarkers should be followed by a TTE (figure 1).

Myocardial Injury Secondary to Oxygen Supply and Demand Mismatch

Cardinal signs of any infection include fever and tachycardia, physiological adaptations that increase the myocardium's oxygen requirements. Furthermore, as COVID‐19 pneumonia is associated with hypoxemia, oxygen supply can be significantly reduced. In critical patients, clinical scenarios, such as sepsis, septic shock, and coagulopathy with associated bleeding, can impair coronary perfusion. Moreover, sympathetic activation and biological stress caused by cytokine storm can produce coronary vasospasm. Collectively, these factors can affect the oxygen supply/demand balance and lead to myocardial injury with nonobstructive disease, consistent with the diagnosis of type 2 MI, according to the Fourth Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction. Patients with preexisting coronary artery disease may be at higher risk of type 2 MI. 71 Of note, patients who had a type 2 MI have a similar rate of major adverse cardiovascular events as those with type 1 MI. 71 Given that patients with moderate or severe COVID‐19 who require hospitalization are usually older and with more cardiovascular comorbidities, type 2 MI in this population is common and represents a marker of poor outcomes. 72

Cardiac Arrhythmias and Pericardial Effusion

Most patients presenting with COVID‐19 will not have symptoms or signs of arrhythmias or conduction system disease. However, in patients who are critically ill, cardiac arrhythmias are more common. 73 Risk factors for arrhythmias are myocardial injury or ischemia, hypoxia, shock, and electrolyte disturbances; those receiving medications that prolong the QT interval are also at risk. 73 In an observational study, the most frequent arrhythmias were atrial fibrillation (3.6%), nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (1.4%), cardiac arrest (1.3%), and bradyarrhythmias (1.3%). 74 In a cardiac magnetic resonance series, pericardial effusion was found in 20% of the patients. 58 It is hypothesized that viruses cause pericardial inflammation via direct cytotoxic effects, systemic inflammation, or immune‐mediated mechanisms. 75

### Universal definition and classification of heart failure: a report of the Heart Failure Society of America, heart failure association of the European Society of Cardiology, Japanese heart failure society and writing committee of the universal definition of heart failure [^f5b0f0ba]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2021). High credibility.

Universal definition of heart failure — biomarkers in the definition emphasizes that natriuretic peptides, including brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and N-terminal prohormone for brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), are the most commonly used biomarker in heart failure (HF), yet despite high guideline support for diagnostic use they are largely absent from HF definitions; in contrast, myocardial infarction definitions centrally incorporate troponin. Access to natriuretic peptide testing is increasing and it is becoming part of standard care, but interpretation must be individualized because conditions such as chronic kidney disease, atrial fibrillation, pericardial disease, pulmonary embolism, and aging can increase levels, and differences by race/ethnicity, sex, and age as well as atrial fibrillation–specific thresholds affect interpretation. In HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) or obesity, levels can be lower than in HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), complicating use. BNP and NT-proBNP generally track similarly and either can be used if their absolute values and cut points are not used interchangeably. BNP, but not NT-proBNP, is a neprilysin substrate, so angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor therapy may increase BNP but not NT-proBNP. Patient-level changes should be read against baseline because natriuretic peptides are higher during decompensation than during compensated periods, reflecting dynamic temporal changes.

### Cardiopulmonary emergencies in older adults [^5572706b]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Older adults are susceptible to serious illnesses, including atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, pneumonia, and pulmonary embolism. Atrial fibrillation is the most common arrhythmia in this age group and can cause complications such as thromboembolic events and stroke. Congestive heart failure is the most common cause of hospital admission and readmission in the older adult population. Older adults are at higher risk for pulmonary embolism because of age-related changes and comorbidities. Pneumonia is also prevalent and is one of the leading causes of death.

### Outcomes of atrial fibrillation in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^10894bc8]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Recently, emerging evidence has suggested that atrial fibrillation (AF) has an epidemiological correlation with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, the clinical outcomes of AF in COVID-19 remain inconsistent and inconclusive. The aim of this study was to provide a comprehensive description of the impact of AF on the prognosis of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.

Methods

Three electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science) were searched for eligible studies as of March 1, 2021. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to evaluate the associations between AF (preexisting and new-onset) and in-hospital mortality, post-discharge mortality, and ventilator use.

Results

A total of 36 individual studies were incorporated into our meta-analysis. The combined results revealed that preexisting AF was associated with increased in-hospital mortality (pooled OR: 2.07; 95% CI: 1.60–2.67; p < 0.001), post-discharge mortality (pooled OR: 2.69; 95% CI: 1.24–5.83; p < 0.05), and ventilator utilization (pooled OR: 4.53; 95% CI: 1.33–15.38; p < 0.05) in patients with COVID-19. In addition, our data demonstrated that new-onset AF during severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection was significantly correlated with increased mortality (pooled OR: 2.38; 95% CI: 2.04–2.77; p < 0.001).

Conclusions

The presence of AF is correlated with adverse outcomes in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, which deserves increased attention and should be managed appropriately to prevent adverse outcomes.

### Cardiac troponins in the intensive care unit: common causes of increased levels and interpretation [^6ec5cde8]. Critical Care Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Clinical chemistry is an important component of the diagnosis of many conditions, and advances in laboratory science have brought many new diagnostic tools to the intensive care unit clinician, including new biomarkers of cardiac injury like troponin T and I. Interpretation of these clinical laboratory results requires knowledge of the performance of these tests.

Setting and Patients

This article reviews the interpretation and performance of diagnostic markers of myocardial injury in patients with diverse clinical conditions of interest to critical care practitioners.

Conclusions

Cardiac troponin I and T, regulatory components of the contractile apparatus, are sensitive indicators of myocardial injury and have become central to the diagnosis of myocardial infarction. The troponins are also released in a number of clinical situations in which thrombotic complications of coronary artery disease and resultant acute myocardial infarction have not occurred. These situations include conditions like pulmonary embolism, sepsis, myocarditis, and acute stroke. Elevated troponins in these conditions are thought to emanate from injured myocardial cells and, in most circumstances, have been associated with adverse outcomes. Practitioners should be mindful of the wide spectrum of diseases that may result in elevated troponin when interpreting these measurements.

### Thromboembolic risk in patients with pneumonia and new-onset atrial fibrillation not receiving anticoagulation therapy [^1a8f3c61]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

What is the risk of thromboembolism and recurrent atrial fibrillation after infection-related atrial fibrillation?

Findings

In this cohort study including 274 196 patients with pneumonia, of whom 6553 developed atrial fibrillation, the 1-year risk of thromboembolism was 0.8% in patients without atrial fibrillation vs 2.1% in patients with atrial fibrillation. Among patients with new-onset atrial fibrillation, 32.9% had a recurrent hospital contact with atrial fibrillation and 14.0% initiated anticoagulation therapy during 3-year follow-up.

Meaning

These findings suggest that the concept of infection-related atrial fibrillation as a transient condition needs reconsideration given the high risks of recurrence combined with risks of thromboembolism that may warrant anticoagulation therapy.

### 2023 ACC / AHA / ACCP / HRS guideline for the diagnosis and management of atrial fibrillation: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^816b1bce]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Atrial fibrillation during acute medical illness or surgery — epidemiology and outcomes show wide incidence and high recurrence with adverse events. Incidence ranges from 1% to 46% in medical illness, with 6% to 22% in severe sepsis, and 3% to 16% after noncardiac surgery; recurrent AF was noted in 42% to 68% in acute medical illness and 39% after noncardiac surgery during 5-year follow-up. In 10 723 patients with newly diagnosed AF (67.9 ± 9.9 years, 41% women), 11% had an acute AF precipitant — cardiac surgery (22%), pneumonia (20%), and noncardiac surgery (15%) — and AF recurrence at 5 years was 41% with a precipitant versus 52% without (adjusted HR, 0.75 [95% CI, 0.69–0.81]; P < 0.001). Regardless of a precipitant, recurrent AF was associated with increased risks of heart failure (HF; HR, 2.74 [95% CI, 2.39–3.15]; P < 0.001), stroke (HR, 1.57 [95% CI, 1.30–1.90]; P < 0.001), and death (HR, 2.96 [95% CI, 2.70–3.24]; P < 0.001).

### COVID-19 pandemic and troponin: indirect myocardial injury, myocardial inflammation or myocarditis? [^406d0a33]. Heart (2020). Medium credibility.

The initial mechanism for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is the binding of the virus to the membrane-bound form of ACE2, which is mainly expressed in the lung. Since the heart and the vessels also express ACE2, they both could become targets of the virus. However, at present the extent and importance of this potential involvement are unknown. Cardiac troponin levels are significantly higher in patients with more severe infections, patients admitted to intensive care units or in those who have died. In the setting of COVID-19, myocardial injury, defined by an increased troponin level, occurs especially due to non-ischaemic myocardial processes, including severe respiratory infection with hypoxia, sepsis, systemic inflammation, pulmonary thrombosis and embolism, cardiac adrenergic hyperstimulation during cytokine storm syndrome, and myocarditis. At present, there are limited reports on definite diagnosis of myocarditis caused by SARS-CoV-2 in humans and limited demonstration of the virus in the myocardium. In conclusion, although the heart and the vessels are potential targets in COVID-19, there is currently limited evidence on the direct infection of the myocardium by SARS-CoV-2. Additional pathological studies and autopsy series will be very helpful to clarify the potentiality of COVID-19 to directly infect the myocardium and cause myocarditis.

1 INTRODUCTION

In December 2019, a novel coronavirus (SARS‐CoV‐2) resulted in an outbreak of pneumonia in Wuhan, China (coronavirus disease 2019, Covid‐19), which has since become a global pandemic. 1, 2 Many therapies have been evaluated, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 but few have been shown to improve outcomes includingremdesivir 9, 10 and dexamethasone. 12 Given the disease burden, effective treatments are urgently required. Even though the predominant manifestation of Covid‐19 is a respiratory illness, concomitant cardiovascular complications result in substantial morbidity and mortality. 13

Acute cardiac injury, defined as a troponin above the 99%, may occur in up to a quarter of patients, though the incidence depends on the severity of illness and underlying comorbidities of the hospitalized population. 14, 15, 16 In many patients, cardiac dysfunction may contribute to mortality, often in combination with respiratory failure, 17 as patients with elevated troponins are more likely to have acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and require mechanical ventilation. 18, 19 An elevated troponin may confer a mortality as high as 50%, and similarly, patients with abnormal N‐terminal pro‐brain natriuretic peptides (NT‐proBNP) have a dismal prognosis. 19, 20, 21

In patients who succumb to Covid‐19, the troponin may continue to rise throughout the illness, a pattern distinct from the typical rise and fall after an ischemic insult. 19 Moreover, patients with elevated troponins have higher levels of CRP. The correlation, though modest in magnitude, is similar to the correlation between troponin and NT‐proBNP. 19, 21 These observations suggest that certain patients develop a heightened inflammatory state that perpetuates nonischemic myocardial injury. These biomarker changes have been described as a "cytokine storm" and appear strongly related to adverse outcomes. Antagonizing the inflammatory state by attenuating the deleterious cytokine response therefore has the potential to improve clinical outcomes. 22

Canakinumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody neutralizing IL‐1β with linear dose‐dependent pharmacokinetics and a long elimination half‐life of 26 days. 23 Canakinumab is approved to treat auto‐inflammatory diseases such as cryopyrin‐associated periodic syndromes (CAPS) and Familial Mediterranean Fever. 24, 25, 26 In a large randomized trial of patients with atherosclerotic disease and increased inflammation, treatment with canakinumab led to a lower rate of recurrent cardiovascular events. 25

COVID-19 and cardiovascular complications

Epidemiologic data thus far suggest that patients with cardiovascular risk factors, including older age, cardiovascular disease, or cancer are more susceptible to infection and suffer from worse clinical outcomes. COVID-19 can also directly result in a number of cardiovascular complications, including fulminant myocarditis, myocardial injury, heart failure, and arrhythmia. There have been a number of published case reports of clinically suspected myocarditis as suggested by: markedly elevated troponin levels, ST-segment elevation on electrocardiogram without obstructive coronary disease, severely decreased left ventricular systolic function, and shock, with cardiac magnetic resonance imaging evidence of diffuse myocardial edema and gadolinium enhancement. However, in another isolated autopsy report from a patient who suffered from SARS-CoV-2–related pneumonia and cardiac arrest, no obvious histological changes in the myocardium were observed with the exception of few interstitial mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates.

Elevated troponin levels have also been observed in those with worse clinical outcomes. In a retrospective, single-center analysis of 416 hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19, 19.7% displayed evidence of cardiac injury, as defined by elevated high-sensitivity troponin I levels greater than the 99th percentile upper limit. Those with confirmed cardiac injury tended to be older (median age of 74 vs. 60 years) and suffer from hypertension (59.8% vs. 23.4%), diabetes (24.4% vs. 12.0%), coronary heart disease (29.3% vs. 6.0%), heart failure (14.6% vs. 1.5%), or cancer (8.5% vs. 0.6%).

### Incidence, risk factors and outcomes of new-onset atrial fibrillation in patients with sepsis: a systematic review [^de37a939]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusions

New-onset AF is a common occurrence in critically ill patients with sepsis, and its incidence rises with increasing severity of disease. Multivariable analyses suggest that it is independently associated with poor outcome, but whether this relation is truly causal remains difficult to establish. In view of these findings there is a need for better quality observational studies, because reliable identification of patients with sepsis who are prone for the development of AF may allow for early pharmacological interventions to prevent this complication.

### Acute pneumonia and the cardiovascular system [^c3f76e55]. Lancet (2013). Excellent credibility.

Although traditionally regarded as a disease confined to the lungs, acute pneumonia has important effects on the cardiovascular system at all severities of infection. Pneumonia tends to affect individuals who are also at high cardiovascular risk. Results of recent studies show that about a quarter of adults admitted to hospital with pneumonia develop a major acute cardiac complication during their hospital stay, which is associated with a 60% increase in short-term mortality. These findings suggest that outcomes of patients with pneumonia can be improved by prevention of the development and progression of associated cardiac complications. Before this hypothesis can be tested, however, an adequate mechanistic understanding of the cardiovascular changes that occur during pneumonia, and their role in the trigger of various cardiac complications, is needed. In this Review, we summarise knowledge about the burden of cardiac complications in adults with acute pneumonia, the cardiovascular response to this infection, the potential effects of commonly used cardiovascular and anti-infective drugs on these associations, and possible directions for future research.

### Atrial fibrillation (chronic) [^9d111a24]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2011). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Atrial fibrillation is a supraventricular tachyarrhythmia characterised by the presence of fast and uncoordinated atrial activation leading to reduced atrial mechanical function. Risk factors for atrial fibrillation include increasing age, male sex, co-existing cardiac and thyroid disease, pyrexial illness, electrolyte imbalance, cancer, and co-existing infection.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of oral medical treatments to control heart rate in people with chronic (defined as longer than 1 week for this review) non-valvular atrial fibrillation? What is the effect of different treatment strategies (rate versus rhythm) for people with persistent non-valvular atrial fibrillation? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to June 2011 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 23 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: beta-blockers (with or without digoxin), calcium channel blockers (with or without digoxin), calcium channel blockers (rate-limiting), digoxin, and rate versus rhythm control strategies.

From a clinical point of view, our study has 2 major implications. First, our findings suggest that new-onset AF during pneumonia is a marker of future AF. This implies that vigilance for recurrent AF may be warranted and that attention should be given to each episode of infection-related AF, regardless of its duration, to tailor surveillance in patients developing this complication. Second, our findings suggest that new-onset AF occurring with pneumonia is associated with a risk of thromboembolism that reaches a level where OAC therapy is considered beneficial. The question remains whether these patients should initiate lifelong OAC therapy. Previously, a UK study found that patients with resolved AF remained at higher risk of stroke than patients without AF. According to current guidelines, patients with non–infection-related AF receive OAC therapy according to their perceived stroke risk rather than the heart rhythm displayed at a particular time. The updated European Society of Cardiology guidelinesstate that the clinical pattern of AF (ie, first detected, paroxysmal, persistent, longstanding persistent, or permanent) should not condition the indication to thromboprophylaxis. In the era of non–vitamin K OAC therapy, perhaps it is time for infection-related AF to be treated in the same way as non–infection-related AF, with long-term anticoagulation maintained in patients with manifested clinical stroke risk factors. However, the decision to initiate anticoagulation treatment in the setting of severe infections is complex. High bleeding risk due to systemic activation of the inflammatory response and depletion of coagulation factors and platelets may outweigh the benefits of anticoagulation. Most trials investigating different OAC therapies for stroke prophylaxis excluded patients with AF due to reversible conditions, and high-quality evidence regarding the role of OAC in patients with infection-related AF is lacking.

Data Collection

Demographics (age, sex, and race) and pre‐existing comorbid conditions (coronary artery disease, heart failure, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, prior history of atrial fibrillation, pulmonary disease, renal disease [defined as creatinine ≥ 2.0 mg/dL or need for hemodialysis], and active cancer) were abstracted from the electronic health record. Hypoxia on presentation was defined as use of supplemental oxygen in the emergency department within 3 hours of presentation as abstracted from respiratory flowsheets and nursing documentation. Chest radiographic findings were abstracted from the initial and any follow‐up radiology reports and categorized based on the most abnormal findings. Transthoracic echocardiography findings on left ventricular ejection fraction and right ventricular function were abstracted. Right ventricular dysfunction was defined as tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion < 17 mm or right ventricular longitudinal myocardial velocity < 9.5 mm/s.

Data on laboratory values consisting of serum troponin I (TnI) (measured with chemiluminescent immunoassay; ADVIA Centaur XP, Siemens Medical Solutions, Malverne, PA), B‐type natriuretic peptide (BNP) (chemiluminescent immunoassay; ADVIA Centaur XP, Siemens Medical Solutions, Malverne, PA), CRP (C‐reactive protein) (latex‐enhanced immunoturbidimetric assay; ADVIA Chemistry XPT system, Siemens Medical Solutions, Malverne, PA), ferritin (chemiluminescent immunoassay; ADVIA Centaur XP, Siemens Medical Solutions, Malverne, PA), and‐dimer (turbidimetric clot detection assay; ACLTM TOP CTS Coagulation System, Instrumentation Laboratory, Bedford, MA), and were reviewed and the maximum level for each biomarker was recorded. Follow‐up was through May 10, 2020, providing at least 30 days of observation for all patients; hospitalization events were determined based on review of clinical progress notes and discharge summaries. The hospital course of patients discharged but readmitted during the clinical study period was also included in the analysis. For patients who were readmitted, the duration of follow‐up was determined based on the date of first admission. Use of antiviral medications, hydroxychloroquine, steroids, and vasopressors during hospitalization was abstracted. Complications including intensive care unit admission, respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation, bacteremia, venous thromboembolism, arterial thromboembolism, stroke/transient ischemic attack, and acute kidney injury requiring renal replacement therapy were abstracted.

### Atrial fibrillation is not just an artefact in the ICU [^57986e40]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is common in the intensive care unit (ICU) and is particularly frequent (46%) in septic shock patients. Inflammation favours AF in the general population, and there is a growing body of evidence that inflammation also plays a role in AF occurring after cardiac surgery but also in the general ICU. How such a finding could modify the therapeutic approach remains elusive. The impact of AF on mortality is not clearly demonstrated in the ICU, with AF reflecting essentially the severity of the underlying disease.

Statistical Analysis

Categorical variables are shown as frequencies, and continuous variables are presented as mean ± standard deviation or median (interquartile range [IQR]) depending on normality of distribution. For comparisons of categorical variables, the χ 2 or Fisher exact tests were used. For comparisons of continuous variables, the Student t test or Wilcoxon rank‐sum test were used depending on normality of distribution. For Student t test, depending on the equality of variances estimated from the F test, either the pooled variance estimator or Satterthwaite variance estimator were used for equal or unequal variances, respectively. The primary study cohort consisted of all study patients who had at least 1 measurement of all 5 biomarkers (TnI, CRP, BNP, ferritin and‐dimer). Based on NYP‐Weill Cornell Medicine nominal reference values, abnormal levels were defined as TnI > 0.04 ng/mL (limit of detection 0.03 ng/mL; maximum 500 ng/mL), BNP > 100 pg/mL (limit of detection 2 pg/mL; maximum 5000 pg/mL), CRP > 0.9 mg/dL (limit of detection 0.4 mg/dL; maximum 91.2 mg/dL), ferritin > 322 ng/mL (limit of detection 0.5 ng/mL; maximum 16 500 ng/mL), and‐dimer > 230 ng/mL (limit of detection 150 ng/mL; maximum 55 000 ng/mL). Myocardial injury was defined as TnI level ≥ 0.50 ng/mL. Within this cohort, the quartiles for each biomarker level were determined. Patients were categorized as having severe biomarker level elevation on the basis of a recorded peak level ≥ 75th percentile for the study population. Bivariate associations between each candidate predictor and the primary outcome (30‐day in‐hospital mortality) were determined with logistic regression. Baseline demographic characteristics (age, sex, and race), comorbid conditions (including coronary artery disease, heart failure, prior history of atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, pulmonary disease, renal disease, immunosuppression, smoking status, and cancer), marker of disease severity at presentation (hypoxia in the first 3 hours of admission), and severe biomarker (TnI, BNP, CRP, ferritin, and‐dimer) elevation with bivariate significance (P < 0.10) for the primary outcome were selected. Multivariable logistic regression models were then used to identify independent predictors of 30‐day mortality. Collinearity of variables was assessed with the variance inflation factor.

### Atrial fibrillation (chronic) [^e5fccc81]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2008). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Atrial fibrillation is a supraventricular tachyarrhythmia, which is characterised by the presence of fast and uncoordinated atrial activation leading to reduced atrial mechanical function. Risk factors for atrial fibrillation include increasing age, coexisting cardiac and thyroid disease, pyrexial illness, electrolyte imbalance, cancer, and coexisting infection.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of oral medical treatments to control heart rate in people with chronic (defined as longer than 1 week for this review) non-valvular atrial fibrillation? What is the effect of different treatment strategies (rate vs. rhythm) for people with persistent non-valvular atrial fibrillation? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library and other important databases up to August 2007 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 18 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: beta-blockers (with or without digoxin), calcium channel blockers (with or without digoxin), calcium channel blockers (rate limiting), digoxin, and rate versus rhythm control strategies.

### Predictors and prognosis of elderly hip fracture patients with perioperative atrial fibrillation: a nested case-control study [^7da29d45]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

We found that pulmonary infection is an independent indicator of AF mortality in elderly hip fracture patients. Kjørholt's research revealed that pneumonia is a common complication of hip fracture and can increase mortality by up to four times. The mechanism may be that pneumonia significantly increases the risk of heart failure and AKI, which has been reported in previous studies. We also found that hyponatremia is an independent predictive risk factor for death in hip fracture patients with AF, A serum sodium concentration of less than 135 mmol/L is what defines hyponatremia, an electrolyte abnormality that is often seen in heart failure patients and has been linked to adverse results, as confirmed by the study of Dimitrios Farmakis al, we thought that it also applies to elderly hip fracture patients with AF. The mechanism may be that a number of physiological and metabolic disturbances that can be triggered by hyponatremia, especially cerebral oedema, cardiovascular problems, and exacerbation of the underlying disease, greatly increase the risk of death in patients. Therefore, we should take care of regular medical check-ups and monitoring of serum sodium levels.

In order to improve the survival rate of elderly hip fracture patients with AF, mortality risk factors we should early identification, careful management and targeted treatment, in addition we should also prevent perioperative AF (paroxysmal AF).

In our study, hypertension was an independent risk factor for perioperative paroxysmal AF. The results of Monika Gawałko et al. were consistent with ours. Hypertension is prevalent in > 70% of patients with AF. In turn, hypertensive patients have up to 73% greater likelihood of AF. Current guidelines recommend that systematic AF screening may be warranted in all patients aged ≥ 65 years with at least one cardiovascular disease, including hypertension. The mechanism may be that hypertension significantly increases the risk of AF by causing changes in cardiac structure and function, as well as comorbidities with other cardiovascular diseases.

### Systemic inflammation rapidly induces reversible atrial electrical remodeling: the role of interleukin-6-mediated changes in connexin expression [^661292b7]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, our data for the first time provide evidence that systemic inflammatory activation is associated in the short term with significant electric atrial remodeling, and that interleukin‐6–induced down‐regulation of atrial connexins is mechanistically involved in these changes. Although rapidly reversible, such functional modifications may lead to an increased risk of AF shortly after an acute inflammatory process activates (or a chronic inflammatory disease reactivates). Besides providing a new insight further supporting a link between inflammation and AF, our findings may contribute to explaining why the increased AF risk observed in different inflammatory diseases seems to be mainly attributable to a higher incidence during flares or persistently elevated disease activity. Our data also support the recommendation to translate into clinical practice that the potential impact of a systemic inflammatory state, regardless of its origin, on atrial arrhythmic risk and related complications must always be carefully considered. In this regard, a prompt treatment of concomitant inflammatory conditions, including intercurrent infections, in patients with specific risk factors for AF, such as preexisting cardiac disease or genetic predisposition, may be an important therapeutic measure, although to date largely overlooked. Targeting inflammatory mediators, particularly interleukin‐6, may represent in perspective an innovative approach in antiarrhythmic therapy. 53

### The etiology and prognostic significance of cardiac troponin I elevation in unselected emergency department patients [^cad54c9f]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Cardiac troponin elevations are associated not only with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) but also with multiple other cardiac and non-cardiac conditions.

Study Objectives

To investigate the etiology and clinical significance of cardiac troponin I elevations in an unselected Emergency Department (ED) patient cohort.

Methods

The study population consisted of 991 consecutive troponin-positive patients admitted to the ED of a university hospital with ACS as the presumptive diagnosis. Cardiac troponin I was measured on admission and a follow-up sample was obtained at 6–12 h. Clinical diagnosis was ascertained retrospectively using all the available information including electrocardiogram, clinical data, laboratory tests, and available coronary angiograms.

Results

At admission, 805 (81.2%) patients were already troponin positive; of these, the troponin elevation was related to myocardial infarction (MI) in 654 (81.2%) patients. Finally, 83.0% of the troponin elevations were due to MI, 7.9% were related to other cardiac causes, and 9.1% to non-cardiac diseases. The leading non-cardiac causes were pulmonary embolism, renal failure, pneumonia, and sepsis. Non-cardiac patients with elevated troponin I at admission showed significantly higher in-hospital mortality (26.7% vs. 13.4%, p = 0.002) compared to cardiac patients.

Conclusion

Elevated troponin levels for reasons other than MI are common in the ED and are a marker of poor in-hospital prognosis.

COVID‐19 and Myocardial Injury: Possible Mechanisms

Take‐Home Point

Broad elevations of chemokines and cytokines occur in SARS‐CoV2 infection, similar to cytokine release syndrome seen in cancer patients on immune‐modulating therapy. Yet, some overlap with troponin elevation has been seen.

Research Questions

Could the elevation in inflammatory markers (eg, interleukin‐6) play a role in COVID‐19 associated cardiac toxicity? And if so, could this be a potential target for treatment?

A growing number of reports have described cardiac injury, absent of coronary obstruction, during severe COVID‐19 infection. 43, 44 In a recent single‐center study of 416 patients with confirmed COVID‐19, cardiac troponin I elevation was seen in 19.7% and corresponded to higher in‐hospital mortality. 7 Similarly, in another study of 187 confirmed COVID‐19 patients, 52 (27.8%) had evidence of myocardial injury, reflected by elevated troponin T. 6 In addition to elevations in troponin, a study of 138 hospitalized COVID‐19 patients also revealed a high prevalence of arrhythmias, occurring in 16.7% (n = 23) of patients. 5 Despite these observations, the exact mechanism(s) by which COVID‐19 induces cardiac damage (Figure 2) remain unclear.

Figure 2
Balance of the evidence to guide current understanding of mechanisms of clinical cardiac events after coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) infection.

CRP indicates C‐reactive protein; IL, interleukin; MRI, magnetic resonance imaging; and SARS, severe acute respiratory syndrome.

Viral myocarditis with inflammatory infiltrates or myocyte necrosis and injury by a systemic inflammatory response have been implicated as potential causes of cardiac injury. Herein, we used the criteria for clinically suspected myocarditis by the European Society of Cardiology 45 for a critical appraisal of reports on cardiac injury by SARS, Middle East respiratory syndrome, and other coronavirus infections as well as emerging data on COVID‐19. Moreover, we discuss the concept of broad systemic inflammatory response as an alternative or additional mechanism for myocardial injury in COVID‐19.

6 CONCLUSION

Our study underscores the significant impact of AF on the outcomes of hospitalized COVID‐19 patients. The findings of the study suggest that COVID‐19 patients with AF constitute a vulnerable subgroup with worse clinical outcomes. Further research is warranted to enhance our understanding of the intricate relationship between AF and COVID‐19 and develop evidence‐based strategies to mitigate its adverse effects on this high‐risk subgroup.

### Susceptibility and prognosis of COVID-19 patients with cardiovascular disease [^be7b1305]. Open Heart (2020). Medium credibility.

Cardiovascular complications of COVID-19 infection

Although the values vary between studies, they all indicate that individuals with underlying CVDs are more susceptible to COVID-19 and that these patients are more prone to critical conditions and death. It is well known that acute pulmonary infection, particularly with viral pathogens, can destabilise cardiac disease. Any deterioration of these diseases would, in turn, complicate the management of COVID-19. A local infection to the viral antigens can propagate into a systemic response. In patients with pneumonia, the most frequent causes of death are respiratory failure, sepsis and cardiac arrhythmias. The study presented by Wang and colleagues showed that of the 138 patients, while 27 (19.6%) had acute respiratory distress syndrome, there was acute cardiac injury in 10 (7.2%) patients. Although this was stated as being defined as troponin I elevation or new abnormalities on imaging, they did not provide clear classification of echocardiography parameters.

Viral infection can also lead to heart rhythm abnormalities. The study by Wang and colleagues identified that arrhythmia was reported in 23 (16.7%) patients with COVID-19. Similar to the echocardiography findings, arrhythmia classification parameters were not clearly outlined by the study. However, if COVID-19 does follow the trends of other beta coronaviruses, then arrhythmias are likely to be a common dysfunction in patients — Yu et al reported that in patients with SARS, tachycardia was present in 71.9% and bradycardia occurred in 14.9% as a transient event.

To date, there is limited published data on the features of the myocardium in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. Future studies must identify, via biopsies, the histological features of the myocardium. Alternatively, cardiac MRI could provide crucial non-invasive insight into the nature of the cardiac injury in these patients.

### 2022 AHA / ACC key data elements and definitions for cardiovascular and noncardiovascular complications of COVID-19: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical data standards [^eb0cd1fc]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

COVID-19 cardiovascular complications — postacute injury and thromboembolism are described with proposed mechanisms and imaging/biomarker findings. Mechanisms for long-term cardiovascular complications include direct and indirect viral-mediated damage, procoagulant state, immune effects on the myocardium/pericardium/conduction system, and downregulation of angiotensin-converting enzyme–2 (ACE2). Myocardial abnormalities and injury have been reported on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and cardiac troponin elevations have occurred in some patients > 2 months after diagnosis of COVID-19. Myocardial fibrosis or scar associated with cardiomyopathy from viral infection can lead to arrhythmias, and the risk for thromboembolic complications in the postacute phase is possibly associated with the duration and severity of hyperinflammatory state.

### Severe symptomatic aortic stenosis? Check troponin, too [^50c60e52]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

It is not the first time that the troponin levels have been studied in the setting of TAVI. Different smaller series 2, 3 have suggested pre‐procedural high‐sensitivity troponin T as a prognostic factor of mortality but the significance of post‐TAVI troponin rise still remained controversial. 4, 5, 6 In the recently published PROMISE (Prospective Multicenter Imaging Study for Evaluation of Chest Pain) trial in patients with known coronary artery disease, higher baseline levels of troponin were associated with a significantly greater risk of a composite of death, acute myocardial infarction, or hospitalization for unstable angina as well as an elevated risk of cardiovascular death or acute myocardial infarction at 1 year. 6 Overall, elevated baseline troponin levels may indicate myocardial damage, left ventricular hypertrophy, and advanced stages of cardiomyopathy and it is not a surprise to detect elevated high‐sensitivity troponin levels in elderly patients in need for aortic valve replacement. Nevertheless, it is hard to attribute the baseline troponin elevation to a specific factor as the increased sensitivity of this test comes at a cost of decreased specificity. In the present study by Akodad and colleagues, 4 independent predictors of pre‐procedural troponin values were identified: male sex, atrial arrhythmia, low glomerular filtration rate, and pre‐procedural N‐terminal pro b‐type natriuretic peptide. Patients who had normal or near‐normal troponin before the procedure were younger, with less atrial fibrillation or vascular disease, better left ventricular ejection fraction, better renal function, and lower N‐terminal pro b‐type natriuretic peptide levels. In everyday practice we see patients with atrial fibrillation and rapid ventricular response to frequently "leak" troponins, especially if there is underlying coronary artery disease. Similarly, patients with congestive heart failure have elevated troponins in the setting of fluid overload, especially if there is underlying renal dysfunction and slower troponin clearance. Once the heart rate is well controlled or the patients' volume status is optimized, the troponin levels usually downtrend and go back to normal. The typical patients undergoing TAVI are elderly and they usually have different comorbidities including atrial fibrillation, low ejection fraction, and renal dysfunction. It would be difficult to address all these issues before the procedure; however, all these risk factors are modifiable and can be controlled with medical management. An elevated pre‐procedural troponin level may indicate some fluid overload in 1 patient or some baseline tachycardia in another but based on the findings of this trial both groups of patients incur adverse long‐term outcomes compared with medically optimized patients.

### Role of advanced imaging in COVID-19 cardiovascular complications [^22403fa1]. Insights Into Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a pandemic disease caused by a novel single-stranded enveloped RNA virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the 7th known human coronavirus.

The virus enters cells through the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, mostly expressed in lung alveolar cells, cardiac myocytes and vascular endothelial cells.

Clinical manifestations of COVID-19 are dominated by respiratory symptoms, due to the tropism of the SARS-CoV-2 for the lungs, where it causes interstitial pneumonia. The most common severe complications are acute respiratory disease syndrome (ARDS) and systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), which can lead to multiorgan failure (MOF) and shock.

Both direct and indirect involvement of other organs is common, and, although the underlying pathological mechanism is still under investigation, the cardiovascular system seems to be particularly affected.

Cardiac injury was early recognized among COVID-19 cases in China; in the report from the National Health Commission almost 11.8% of patients without underlying cardiovascular disease had cardiac injury during hospitalization, showed by elevated T-troponin (TnT) levels and/or new onset of ECG/echocardiographic abnormalities.

In addition to its prevalence, cardiac injury seems to be significantly associated with fatal outcome.

Retrospective studies among hospitalized COVID-19 patients have reported a more severe respiratory disease in patients with cardiac injury, requiring in greater proportion both noninvasive and invasive mechanical ventilation, and markedly higher mortality rate.

Several case reports and case series released so far describe cardiovascular manifestations among COVID-19 patients, such as myocarditis, acute coronary syndrome (ACS), arrhythmias, pericarditis and venous thromboembolic events.

Along with the understanding of the underlying pathological mechanisms of myocardial injury, a prompt diagnosis becomes essential for risk stratification and to define tailored treatment strategies.

Present article aimed to review the role of advanced multimodality imaging in patients with suspected SARS-CoV-2-related cardiovascular involvement.

Current emerging scientific evidence has been combined with our 8-month clinical work as one of the national referrals for COVID-19 infection. Based on our experience, we also sought to suggest possible diagnostic algorithms for the rationale utilization of advanced imaging tools in this specific clinical setting.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for chest pain, more specifically with respect to troponin levels, ACC/ACCP/AHA/ASE/SAEM/SCCT/SCMR 2021 guidelines recommend to consider obtaining serial cardiac troponin I or T levels to identify abnormal values and a rising or falling pattern indicative of acute myocardial injury in patients presenting with acute chest pain.

### Usefulness of elevated troponin to predict death in patients with COVID-19 and myocardial injury [^7a04be0d]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Elevations in troponin levels have been shown to predict mortality in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The role of inflammation in myocardial injury remains unclear. We sought to determine the association of elevated troponin with mortality in a large, ethnically diverse population of patients hospitalized with COVID-19, and to determine the association of elevated inflammatory markers with increased troponin levels. We reviewed all patients admitted at our health system with COVID-19 from March 1 to April 27, 2020, who had a troponin assessment within 48 hours of admission. We used logistic regression to calculate odds ratios (ORs) for mortality during hospitalization, controlling for demographics, co-morbidities, and markers of inflammation. Of 11,159 patients hospitalized with COVID-19, 6,247 had a troponin assessment within 48 hours. Of these, 4,426 (71%) patients had normal, 919 (15%) had mildly elevated, and 902 (14%) had severely elevated troponin. Acute phase and inflammatory markers were significantly elevated in patients with mildly and severely elevated troponin compared with normal troponin. Patients with elevated troponin had significantly increased odds of death for mildly elevated compared with normal troponin (adjusted OR, 2.06; 95% confidence interval, 1.68 to 2.53; p < 0.001) and for severely elevated compared with normal troponin (OR, 4.51; 95% confidence interval, 3.66 to 5.54; p < 0.001) independently of elevation in inflammatory markers. In conclusion, patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and elevated troponin had markedly increased mortality compared with patients with normal troponin levels. This risk was independent of cardiovascular co-morbidities and elevated markers of inflammation.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for chest pain, more specifically with respect to troponin levels, ACC/ACCP/AHA/ASE/SAEM/SCCT/SCMR 2021 guidelines recommend to obtain high-sensitivity cardiac troponin as the preferred biomarker because it enables more rapid detection or exclusion of myocardial injury and increases diagnostic accuracy in patients presenting with acute chest pain.

Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for atrial fibrillation, more specifically with respect to patients with postoperative AF, rate and rhythm control, ACC/ACS/AHA/ASNC/HRS/SCA/SCCT/SCMR/SVM 2024 guidelines recommend to consider treating potential underlying triggers contributing to AF and rapid ventricular response (sepsis, anemia, pain) in patients with rapid AF identified in the setting of noncardiac surgery.

### Clinical characteristics and risk factors of cardiac involvement in COVID-19 [^dc16410c]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

The widespread outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19, previously known as 2019‐nCoV) is a big challenge for public health and medical care. Since its first emergence in late December 2019, COVID‐19 has already spread to surpass 150 countries and territories. As of July 10, 2020, there were 12 015 193 confirmed cases worldwide, with 54 247 fatalities, 1 and the World Health Organization had declared the outbreak a pandemic. To date, several of the latest studies have reported the clinical characteristics of hospitalized patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP), including signs, symptoms, laboratory test results, imaging features, therapeutic strategies and effects, and multiple organ dysfunction. 2, 3, 4, 5 Notably, acute cardiac injury, defined as "TNT‐HSST (hypersensitive troponin T) serum levels > 99th percentile upper reference limit (> 28 pg/mL), or new abnormalities were shown in electrocardiography or echocardiography" by previous literature about the COVID‐19 combined with the European Society of Cardiology guidelines' definition of myocardial infarction, 3, 6 was detected in ≈7.2% to 27.8% patients with COVID‐19 in previous studies. 2, 3 Furthermore, both severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have been linked to acute myocarditis, acute myocardial injury, and rapid‐onset heart failure. 7, 8, 9 Reportedly, 2 nearly 40% of hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID‐19 have underlying comorbidities such as cardiovascular or cerebrovascular diseases. Recently, a meta‐analysis of 8 studies showed that cardiovascular diseases (5 ± 4; 95% CI, 4%–7%) commonly happened in 46 248 patients. 10 Clerkin et al 11 concluded that COVID‐19 interacts with underlying cardiovascular system dysfunction on a different level, increasing morbidity in patients with underlying cardiovascular conditions, and may provoke myocardial injury and dysfunction. More and more evidence links COVID‐19 with increased morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular complications. Thus, undoubtedly, special medical attention should be paid to patients with COVID‐19 with cardiac complications and underlying cardiovascular diseases. On February 13, 2020, the American College of Cardiology released a clinical bulletin titled "Cardiac Implications of Novel Wuhan Coronavirus (COVID‐19)" 12 for addressing cardiac implications of this disease and offering early clinical guidance given the current uncertainty over COVID‐19. However, detailed clinical characteristics such as laboratory results, cardiac markers, echocardiography, and electrocardiography of patients with COVID‐19 with cardiac involvement have not been investigated in detail. Thus, the aim of this study is to describe the different clinical, laboratory, echocardiographic and electrocardiographic characteristics of patients with COVID‐19–related cardiac involvement and to further determine the clinical risk factors for cardiac involvement in COVID‐19.
