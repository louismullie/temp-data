## Question

What is the recommended management for knee effusions?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the recommended management of knee effusions. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the differential diagnosis and red flags that mandate urgent workup. Then, I should verify the bedside examination and imaging strategy to confirm an effusion and screen for internal derangement. Next, I will consider when to aspirate, what to send from synovial fluid, and how those results guide therapy. After that, I need to review evidence-based treatments by etiology, especially osteoarthritis-related effusions and post-traumatic hemarthrosis. Finally, I should outline follow-up, monitoring, and special populations such as pediatric patients and postoperative knees, while double-checking where guidelines agree or conflict so I don't overstate recommendations.

> Let me first confirm the key red flags and differential. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — acute hot swollen knee with fever, inability to bear weight, recent bacteremia, or immunosuppression should raise concern for septic arthritis and trigger urgent arthrocentesis and targeted imaging, because delay risks joint destruction and sepsis [^1164cqXm]. I will now examine other common etiologies: acute trauma with hemarthrosis or internal derangement, crystal arthropathy, osteoarthritis flare, inflammatory arthritis, reactive arthritis, Lyme arthritis in endemic regions, and hemarthrosis in coagulopathy or anticoagulation, keeping in mind that large spontaneous effusions can signal internal derangement even without radiographic OA [^112793QG] [^113Ghj8g] [^111LJQJk].

> Wait, let me verify the yield of physical exam. The bulge sign and patellar tap can be helpful but are imperfect; combining at least one positive exam maneuver with patient-reported swelling improves sensitivity for MRI-detected effusion-synovitis in early OA, while individual signs have modest likelihood ratios in primary care after trauma, so I shouldn't rely on a single bedside test alone [^116aYhrH] [^117ABcKd].

> Next, I should review imaging choices. If internal derangement is suspected after acute trauma, the presence of a large suprapatellar effusion on lateral radiograph, particularly > 10 mm anteroposterior depth, is highly specific for MRI-proven internal derangement; this helps me prioritize advanced imaging or sports medicine referral without delay [^114qzGTX]. I need to ensure that when the diagnosis is uncertain or the joint is deep, point-of-care ultrasound is used to confirm effusion and guide aspiration, because bedside ultrasound increases detection and procedural success compared to exam alone [^114pVYfF] [^114oZwCd].

> Hold on, I should verify techniques that enhance effusion detection when standard scans are equivocal. Ultrasound during voluntary quadriceps contraction or with a joint cupping maneuver can unmask otherwise occult fluid by redistributing it into the suprapatellar recess, which is particularly useful in obese patients or with small effusions that I might otherwise miss on static scanning [^113HkvKF] [^117DDkHV].

> Let me consider when to aspirate. I need to ensure arthrocentesis is performed for suspected septic arthritis, crystal disease, hemarthrosis, unexplained effusions, or for symptomatic relief of a tense effusion, while avoiding aspiration through overlying cellulitis or prosthetic joints unless in consultation with specialists; in acute post-injury tense hemarthrosis, aspiration may reduce pain and facilitate exam and rehab, though symptomatic benefit can be transient as fluid often reaccumulates [^1124G8hH] [^113zippB] [^112y7z1S].

> I should confirm what to send from synovial fluid. Gram stain, culture, crystals, and cell count with differential remain essential; although synovial WBC is an imperfect discriminator in OA-related effusions, higher counts correlate with MRI effusion-synovitis and can support an inflammatory phenotype, but I must not overinterpret borderline values without clinical context or imaging support [^111KMngG]. But wait, what if the clinical picture is worrisome for infection yet initial tests are equivocal — then I need to escalate with repeat aspiration and advanced imaging to exclude abscess or adjacent osteomyelitis, as per septic arthritis guidance [^1164cqXm].

> Now, management by etiology — let me think about osteoarthritis-associated effusions first. Core therapy should emphasize exercise-based rehabilitation, weight management, and self-management; I should offer supervised or unsupervised land-based or aquatic exercise as a foundational intervention, tailored to function and preferences, because these consistently improve pain and function and may reduce recurrent effusions by addressing synovitis and mechanics [^111MtUFL] [^116rufGU]. I should double-check if assistive devices help; tibiofemoral bracing can be considered when instability or unicompartmental load aggravates symptoms and activity [^111dWkiw].

> Next, I should review injections for OA-related effusions. Intra-articular corticosteroids can be considered for short-term pain relief and functional improvement during inflammatory flares; benefits are generally transient, so I will set expectations, limit frequency, and use image guidance for accuracy when needed, especially in challenging anatomies [^11348Qd5] [^117E31KR] [^115hfJDZ] [^115ormU1]. Hmm, wait a minute, do guidelines align on hyaluronic acid — no, rather they consistently advise against it; evidence shows clinically trivial analgesia and a higher risk of serious adverse events compared with placebo, so I should not recommend viscosupplementation in routine care [^1149YmXB] [^115awaEA] [^116X5ZMZ].

> Hold on, I should verify the stance on platelet-rich plasma. There is guideline discordance: AAOS suggests considering PRP to reduce pain and improve function, whereas ACR recommends against intra-articular PRP in knee OA; I need to discuss this uncertainty with patients, consider cost and variability in preparations, and individualize decisions while acknowledging the conflicting guidance [^114DgeQ1] [^11698cJ7].

> For post-traumatic effusions, let me reconsider the steps. Suspect internal derangement when a rapid hemarthrosis follows twisting injury; radiographic effusion size can triage to MRI, and aspirating a painful, tense hemarthrosis may provide short-term relief and improve examination, but I should counsel that fluid often recurs within a week and that definitive management targets the underlying pathology such as ACL or meniscal injury [^114qzGTX] [^113zippB] [^112y7z1S]. I should double-check for lipohemarthrosis on imaging when fracture is a concern, and escalate imaging accordingly if present [^114rSH9t].

> In postoperative knees, especially after TKA, I need to check whether persistent or increasing effusions signal ongoing inflammation or complications. Greater postoperative effusion volumes, particularly in the suprapatellar and patellofemoral regions, correlate with worse ROM and less improvement in Knee Society Scores, and reductions in effusion over time track with functional gains; if effusion persists or inflammatory markers rise, I should reassess for infection or other causes with targeted imaging and aspiration when appropriate [^113UCZjC] [^1125jvLz] [^1164cqXm].

> For longitudinal monitoring, I should confirm that effusion burden is not just a symptom but a structural risk marker. Higher baseline MRI-assessed effusion volumes and increases over one year associate with accelerated cartilage loss, radiographic progression, and future knee replacement risk, so tracking effusion in OA can inform prognosis and the need to intensify disease-modifying lifestyle and biomechanical strategies [^112oZCfn] [^116HsP7Z].

> I must not forget special populations. In children with fever and knee effusion, I need to ensure urgent evaluation for infection while keeping rheumatologic and vasculitic etiologies in mind; point-of-care ultrasound characterizing complex effusions may suggest inflammatory arthritis such as juvenile idiopathic arthritis, but that should not delay appropriate labs and aspiration when septic arthritis is a concern [^116t3d5N] [^112m19Ax]. In endemic areas with atraumatic large recurrent effusions, I should consider Lyme disease and initiate appropriate antibiotic therapy once confirmed or strongly suspected, recognizing testing nuances that can complicate timely diagnosis [^111LJQJk].

> Let me summarize a practical, verification-minded pathway. First, screen for red flags and if present, perform urgent aspiration and targeted imaging; second, confirm an effusion with exam plus ultrasound when uncertain; third, aspirate when infection, crystals, hemarthrosis, or unexplained effusion are on the table, sending fluid for culture and crystals; fourth, treat the cause: exercise-centered OA care with short-term corticosteroid injections for flares and avoidance of viscosupplementation, injury-specific management for internal derangement with selective aspiration for tense hemarthrosis, and antibiotics for septic or Lyme arthritis; finally, monitor recurrence and function, escalating evaluation if effusions persist or worsen despite therapy, especially in postoperative knees or pediatric patients with systemic symptoms [^114pVYfF] [^1124G8hH] [^115awaEA] [^113UCZjC].

---

Knee effusions are managed by identifying the cause and using a stepwise approach: **aspirate tense effusions** [^112zcu96] for diagnosis and relief [^1124G8hH], and **treat the underlying condition** (e.g. antibiotics for infection [^1164cqXm], disease-modifying therapy for inflammatory arthritis, or surgery for structural lesions [^114D2TyQ]). In osteoarthritis, use intra-articular corticosteroids for short-term relief [^11348Qd5] [^115hfJDZ], and **avoid routine hyaluronic acid injections** [^1149YmXB] [^112nSfnE] [^115awaEA]. Nonpharmacologic care includes **weight loss, exercise, and physical therapy** [^114D2TyQ] [^111MtUFL] [^116rufGU]. Recurrent or refractory effusions may need repeat aspiration [^1124G8hH], synovectomy, or radiosynoviorthesis [^112q1Mjc]. Monitor for complications such as infection [^1124G8hH], cartilage damage [^112oZCfn], and impaired function, and escalate care if effusions persist or worsen [^113UCZjC].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

A thorough diagnostic evaluation is essential to **identify the underlying cause** of knee effusion and guide appropriate treatment [^112793QG]. The following steps are recommended:

- **History and physical examination**: Assess for trauma, systemic symptoms, and underlying medical conditions. Physical examination findings [^116aYhrH] such as self-noticed swelling and positive ballottement test are associated with knee effusion [^117ABcKd].

- **Imaging studies**: MRI is the gold standard for detecting effusion-synovitis [^111KMngG] and associated structural abnormalities [^1162rmm9]. Ultrasound is a useful adjunct [^114oZwCd], particularly in detecting occult effusions [^113HkvKF].

- **Synovial fluid analysis**: Aspiration and analysis of synovial fluid are critical [^114pVYfF] for differentiating between inflammatory, infectious, and degenerative causes of effusion [^1164cqXm].

---

## Non-pharmacological management

Non-pharmacological interventions are foundational in **managing knee effusions**, particularly in osteoarthritis [^116rufGU]:

- **Rest, ice, compression, elevation (RICE)**: Initial conservative management to reduce swelling and inflammation.

- **Physical therapy and exercise**: Supervised and unsupervised exercise programs, including aquatic exercise, are recommended to improve pain and function [^111MtUFL] [^116rufGU].

- **Weight loss**: Strongly recommended for overweight or obese patients to reduce joint load and inflammation [^114D2TyQ].

- **Assistive devices**: Tibiofemoral knee braces may be offered to improve joint stability and function [^111dWkiw].

---

## Pharmacological management

Pharmacological interventions are tailored based on the **underlying cause** of the effusion:

- **Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)**: Effective in reducing pain and inflammation associated with knee effusions [^114D2TyQ].

- **Intra-articular corticosteroid injections**: Recommended for short-term relief in symptomatic knee osteoarthritis [^11348Qd5] [^117E31KR] [^115hfJDZ].

- **Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs)**: Indicated for inflammatory arthritis-related effusions.

---

## Aspiration and injection techniques

Aspiration and injection techniques are essential for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. Aspiration is recommended for **painful, tense effusions** [^112zcu96] — particularly after knee injury [^113zippB] — as it provides temporary relief and aids diagnosis [^112y7z1S]. Intra-articular corticosteroid injections are effective for short-term relief, and ultrasound guidance improves accuracy and safety.

---

## Surgical interventions

Surgical interventions are considered when **conservative measures fail** or when **structural abnormalities** are present. Options include arthroscopic synovectomy for chronic inflammatory effusions or synovial hypertrophy; radiosynoviorthesis for chronic inflammatory effusions (particularly in rheumatoid arthritis) [^112q1Mjc]; and total knee arthroplasty for severe osteoarthritis with persistent effusion and joint damage [^114D2TyQ].

---

## Complications and risks

Potential complications associated with knee effusions and their treatments include **infection** — with a risk of septic arthritis following aspiration or injection [^1124G8hH] — and **cartilage damage** from chronic effusions, leading to cartilage degeneration and osteoarthritis progression [^112oZCfn]. Persistent effusions can cause pain, reduced range of motion, and functional impairment [^113UCZjC].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular monitoring and follow-up are essential to assess **treatment effectiveness** and detect **recurrence**. Clinical assessment should regularly evaluate pain, swelling, and joint function, while MRI [^111KMngG] or ultrasound can be used to monitor effusion volume and joint integrity [^112oZCfn]. Patient education should emphasize adherence to treatment plans, weight management, and early reporting of symptoms.

---

## Emerging therapies and future directions

Emerging therapies and novel approaches are being explored for **refractory knee effusions**. Areas under investigation include targeted biologic agents for inflammatory arthritis-related effusions, regenerative medicine approaches, such as stem cell and platelet-rich plasma injections [^114DgeQ1] [^11698cJ7], and advanced imaging with improved MRI [^1177SwYU] and ultrasound techniques [^113HkvKF] for more precise assessment and monitoring.

---

Knee effusions require a **comprehensive approach**, encompassing diagnosis, non-pharmacological and pharmacological treatments, aspiration, and surgery. Regular monitoring and emerging therapies are essential for effective management.

### Arthroscopic surgery for degenerative knee arthritis and meniscal tears: A clinical practice guideline [^114D2TyQ]. BMJ (2017). Low credibility.

Approximately 25% of people older than 50 years experience knee pain from degenerative knee disease. Management options include watchful waiting, weight loss if overweight, a variety of interventions led by physical therapists, exercise, oral or topical pain medications such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, intra-articular corticosteroid and other injections, arthroscopic knee surgery, and knee replacement or osteotomy. The preferred combination or sequence of these options is not clear and probably varies between patients.

Knee replacement is the only definitive therapy, but it is reserved for patients with severe disease after non-operative management has been unsuccessful. Some believe that arthroscopic debridement, including washout of intra-articular debris, with or without arthroscopic partial meniscectomy to remove damaged meniscus, may improve pain and function.

### Knee joint aspiration and injection [^1124G8hH]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Knee joint aspiration and injection are performed to aid in the diagnosis and treatment of knee joint diseases. The knee joint is the most common and easiest joint for physicians to aspirate. One approach involves the insertion of a needle 1 cm above and 1 cm lateral to the superior lateral aspect of the patella at a 45-degree angle. Once the needle has been inserted 1 to 1 1/2 inches, aspiration, aided by local compression, is performed.

Local corticosteroid injections can provide significant relief and often ameliorate acute exacerbations of knee osteoarthritis associated with significant effusions. Indications for arthrocentesis include crystal-induced arthropathy, hemarthrosis, unexplained joint effusion, and symptomatic relief of a large effusion. Contraindications include bacteremia, inaccessible joints, joint prosthesis, and overlying infection in the soft tissue.

Large effusions can recur and may require repeat aspiration. Anti-inflammatory medications may prove beneficial in reducing joint inflammation and fluid accumulations.

### The EANM guideline for radiosynoviorthesis [^112q1Mjc]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2022). Low credibility.

The efficacy of RSO in knee arthroplasty has been explored, although the literature on this topic is scarce. Initial results were reported by Mödder et al, who studied 107 patients with chronic joint effusion due to polyethylene disease. This condition was caused by abrasion particles from the polyethylene inlays. The patients were treated with [90 Y]yttrium citrate, and in 93 out of 107 (87%) cases, the joint effusion was entirely resolved after therapy.

In another study conducted by Mayer-Wagner et al, 55 patients with chronic joint effusion following knee arthroplasty received treatment with radiosynoviorthesis using [90 Y]yttrium colloid. Significant improvements in pain, effusion, and function were observed in 54% of the patients. For the patients in whom RSO treatment was unsuccessful, complications such as infection, loosening, allergy, and trauma were identified. Therefore, it is essential to exclude all potential causes of prosthesis failure before RSO treatment through thorough clinical examination, laboratory testing of inflammatory blood values, synovial fluid aspiration, and appropriate imaging.

### A prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled study to evaluate the efficacy of intraarticular hyaluronic acid for osteoarthritis of the knee [^1155fbM8]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2006). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to assess the efficacy of intraarticular (IA) injections of hyaluronic acid (HA) compared to placebo in patients with osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee. The study also aimed to evaluate patient satisfaction with the treatment relative to the placebo and to determine if there is a difference between a series of 3 versus 6 consecutive IA injections.

Methods: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, two-arm parallel design trial involving 106 patients with radiologically confirmed knee OA. Two-milliliter IA injections of 20 mg/ml HA sodium salt or saline placebo were administered once weekly over 3 weeks (HA and placebo groups), followed by once weekly IA injections with 2.0 mL (20 mg/ml) HA for an additional 3 consecutive weeks. The primary efficacy assessment included the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) score for knee pain at Week 3. Secondary efficacy assessments included WOMAC scores for knee pain at Weeks 6 and 12 (follow-up), as well as WOMAC stiffness, physical function, and quality of life scores. Visual analog scale (VAS) scores for pain at rest and following walking and stepping activity, range of knee joint motion, and global patient satisfaction with treatment and quality of life using the SF-36 were also assessed.

Results: After 3 weeks of study treatment, both treatment groups showed improvements in knee function, with the HA group showing a greater improvement compared to placebo in the WOMAC knee pain score (p < 0.01). The HA group exhibited a greater (p < 0.05) improvement in the overall WOMAC score and VAS pain following walking and stepping activity at Week 3.

### Diagnostic performance of knee physical exam and participant-reported symptoms for MRI-detected effusion-synovitis among participants with early or late stage knee osteoarthritis: data from the Osteoarthritis Initiative [^116aYhrH]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2019). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic performance of knee physical exam findings and participant-reported symptoms for MRI-detected effusion-synovitis (ES) among knees with early and late-stage osteoarthritis (OA).

The design incorporated the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI), a longitudinal study of participants with or at risk for knee OA. Two samples with MRI readings were available: 344 knees with early OA (312 participants) and 216 with late-stage OA (186 participants). Trained examiners performed bulge sign (BS) and patellar tap (PT) exams, and participants reported on knee swelling and pain with leg straightening. Effusion-synovitis on 3T non-contrast MRI was scored using the MRI Osteoarthritis Knee Score (MOAKS). Diagnostic performance of physical exam findings and symptoms was estimated with bootstrapped confidence intervals.

For the early OA sample, the highest sensitivity for medium/large effusion-synovitis was achieved with a positive finding for any of the physical exam maneuvers and/or participant-reported symptoms (81.0 [95% CI: 70.0, 91.3]). Both knee symptoms in combination had a prevalence of 11.7% and yielded the highest estimated positive predictive value (PPV) (50.0 [95% CI: 34.2, 66.7]) and likelihood ratio positive (LR+) (5.2 [95% CI: 2.9, 9.7]). In late-stage OA knees, exam findings and symptoms provided minimal information beyond the prevalence.

In conclusion, patient report of both symptoms, or at least one positive exam finding and at least one symptom, could be used to identify knees at increased risk of effusion-synovitis in knees with early-stage OA.

### Knee effusion volume assessed by magnetic resonance imaging and progression of knee osteoarthritis: data from the Osteoarthritis Initiative [^112oZCfn]. Rheumatology (2019). Low credibility.

This study aimed to examine whether baseline knee joint effusion volume and the change in effusion volume over one year are associated with cartilage volume loss, progression of radiographic osteoarthritis (ROA) over four years, and risk of total knee replacement over six years. It included 4115 Osteoarthritis Initiative participants, with knee joint effusion volume quantified by MRI at baseline. The change in effusion volume over one year was assessed, along with cartilage volume loss and progression of ROA over four years, using MRI and X-ray. The risk of total knee replacement over six years was also evaluated. Multiple linear regression and binary logistic regression were employed for data analyses.

- **Results**: Baseline knee effusion volume (per 5 ml) was positively associated with medial and lateral cartilage volume loss: regression coefficient 0.13%/year (95% CI 0.10, 0.17) and 0.13%/year (95% CI 0.10, 0.16), respectively, both P < 0.001, progression of ROA [odds ratio (OR) 1.28 (95% CI 1.20, 1.37), P < 0.001], and risk of knee replacement [OR 1.12 (95% CI 1.05, 1.20), P = 0.001]. A 5 mL increase in knee effusion volume over one year was positively associated with medial cartilage volume loss: regression coefficient 0.09%/year (95% CI 0.04, 0.15), P = 0.001, progression of ROA [OR 1.21 (95% CI 1.11, 1.33), P < 0.001] and risk of knee replacement [OR 1.24 (95% CI 1.12, 1.37), P < 0.001].

- **Conclusions**: Knee joint effusion volume assessed from MRI provides a continuous and sensitive measure that was associated with cartilage volume loss, progression of ROA, and risk of total knee replacement. The volume could be an essential indicator in managing osteoarthritis progression.

### Traumatic knee injury: Correlation of radiographic effusion size with the presence of internal derangement on magnetic resonance imaging [^114qzGTX]. Emergency Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Traumatic knee injury is a common clinical presentation; however, knee internal derangement often goes undiagnosed on physical examination. The hypothesis is that patients with suprapatellar joint effusion greater than 10 mm anteroposterior diameter on lateral radiograph have a high likelihood of knee internal derangement on magnetic resonance imaging.

A retrospective review of knee radiographs and magnetic resonance imaging in 198 patients, aged 18–40 years with acute knee injury, was performed. Suprapatellar effusion diameter on lateral radiography was correlated with the presence of internal derangement on magnetic resonance imaging. Magnetic resonance imaging anteroposterior effusion size at four locations was correlated to radiographic suprapatellar effusion measurements.

Logistic regression showed a positive correlation between radiographic effusion size and the presence of internal derangement on magnetic resonance exams. A threshold of > 10 mm was established as a positive test, yielding test sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy of 55, 96, 93, 71, and 77%, respectively. Statistical analysis showed that the radiographic anteroposterior effusion diameter most closely approximated the magnetic resonance effusion diameter at the lateral patellofemoral recess.

This study indicates that knee radiography is a highly specific screening test for internal derangement in patients younger than 40 years with acute knee injury.

### Viscosupplementation for knee osteoarthritis: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^115SaWKP]. BMJ (2022). Low credibility.

The prespecified primary outcome was pain intensity, while secondary outcomes included function and serious adverse events. Continuous outcomes were analyzed as standardized mean differences (SMDs). An SMD less than 0 indicates a better outcome for viscosupplementation compared to the control. We back-transformed pooled SMDs to a 100 mm visual analogue scale, assuming a standard deviation of 25 mm (see web appendix 5 for details). Web appendix 6 describes the rationale for selecting the minimal clinically important between-group difference of -0.37.

If pain and function outcomes were reported for more than one time point, we extracted results closest to three months after the last injection. If two or more measurement tools were used, we referred to a previously described hierarchy of outcome measures and extracted data for the one ranked highest on this list. Serious adverse events were reported as events resulting in hospital admission, prolongation of hospital stay, persistent or major disability, congenital abnormality of offspring, life-threatening events, or death.

- **Risk-of-bias assessment**: We assessed the risk of bias for trials included in our main analysis (large, placebo-controlled trials) using the Cochrane collaboration tool 2.0. All other trials were assessed using the Cochrane collaboration tool 1.0. Assessments were performed by a pair of reviewers working independently, with inconsistencies resolved by consensus or discussion with a third reviewer.

### Metabolic and inflammatory profiles define phenotypes with clinical relevance in female knee osteoarthritis patients with joint effusion [^116HMGsz]. Rheumatology (2023). High credibility.

- **Methods**: The subjects of this study are part of a prospective cohort consisting of men and women with primary knee osteoarthritis (KOA) and persistent joint effusion. This cohort includes 202 KOA patients who were consecutively recruited after an outpatient visit in our Rheumatology Service from October 2013 to April 2018. Currently, the cohort comprises 171 women, three of whom were excluded from our study due to a high number of missing values in the parameters used for clustering (> 10%, five variables). This left 168 female KOA patients for our analysis. We focused on female patients to homogenize the study sample, as previous works have reported numerous sex-related differences in osteoarthritis regarding metabolic conditions, inflammatory factors, and levels of pain and functional disability. An exhaustive description of the inclusion and exclusion criteria is available in the Supplementary Information at Rheumatology online.

- **Patients' description**: All subjects signed an informed consent authorizing the collection of samples and data for use in the context of KOA studies. The project was evaluated and approved by the ethical committee of our center (CEIm Parc Taulí) with approval number 2015/539 and was conducted according to national and international ethical guidelines, including the Declaration of Helsinki.

- **Samples**: Samples from plasma and joint fluid were systematically extracted at recruitment from all patients in the cohort. Synovial fluid was obtained by aspiration.

### Volume and distribution of early knee effusion after TKA with a PEEK-based knee prosthesis: Correlation with changes in serum inflammation marker levels, knee functional score, and range of motion [^113UCZjC]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery. American Volume (2025). High credibility.

Using the 1-week total knee effusion volume as a reference for measuring the change in total knee effusion volume, a positive correlation was observed between the reduction in total knee effusion volume and the actual value of the range of motion (ROM) (R² = 0.36; p = 0.0001) from 3 to 24 months postoperatively. There was also a negative correlation between the change in effusion volume in the suprapatellar bursal region (R² = 0.29; p = 0.0006) and ROM. No such correlation was found for the infrapatellar bursal region (R² = 0.05; p = 0.21) or the patellofemoral region (R² = 0.05; p = 0.18).

A negative correlation (R² = 0.19; p = 0.003) was observed between total knee effusion volume and the change in the knee functional score (KSS), indicating that greater effusion volume was associated with less postoperative improvement. A negative correlation was found between knee effusion volume in the suprapatellar bursal region (R² = 0.16; p = 0.006) or patellofemoral region (R² = 0.20; p = 0.002) and the change in the postoperative KSS.

- **Fig. 6**: Correlation analyses revealing a positive correlation between the reduction in total knee joint effusion volume (JEV) or effusion volume in the suprapatellar bursal region and the actual value of the ROM. The greater the total JEV or the postoperative JEV in the suprapatellar and patellofemoral bursal regions, the smaller the postoperative improvement in the KSS. CI = confidence interval.

### Intra-articular corticosteroid injections for symptomatic knee osteoarthritis: What the orthopaedic provider needs to know [^111k87Nn]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2019). Low credibility.

Intra-articular corticosteroid injections have been used for decades in the management of symptomatic osteoarthritis of the knee and remain a common practice. The pain relief from a steroid injection is thought to work by reducing inflammation within the arthritic knee. Substantial variability remains among providers with regard to the technique used to perform the procedure, including the site of the injection, the medications injected, and the level of sterility.

The success of steroid injections in relieving arthritic knee pain most often occurs in the short term. However, the efficacy of intra-articular corticosteroid injections varies within the published literature. The latest American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons clinical practice guideline does not support conclusive recommendations about the use of intra-articular corticosteroid injections for symptomatic knee osteoarthritis. Providers should be aware of the adverse effects and potential complications of these injections when using them in clinical practice.

### Volume and distribution of early knee effusion after TKA with a PEEK-based knee prosthesis: Correlation with changes in serum inflammation marker levels, knee functional score, and range of motion [^116iQxhQ]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery. American Volume (2025). Low credibility.

The relationship between knee effusion and CRP or ESR values is evident through specific metrics. Preoperative values of CRP and ESR were used as benchmarks for assessing changes at each postoperative time point. Results indicate that a higher total knee effusion volume post-surgery corresponds with increased postoperative CRP and ESR values, as well as significant changes in these markers.

- **Correlation analyses**:

- **CRP level**: A positive correlation is noted with knee effusion volume (R² = 0.16; p = 0.007).

- **ESR values**: Also show positive correlation with knee effusion volume (R² = 0.22; p = 0.001).

- **Change in CRP level**: Displays a positive correlation with knee effusion volume (R² = 0.16; p = 0.007).

- **Change in ESR value**: Similarly, a positive correlation is observed (R² = 0.15; p = 0.009).

These findings are illustrated in Fig. 5, which shows that increased total knee effusion volume after surgery is associated with higher postoperative CRP and ESR values or significant changes relative to their preoperative values. CI = confidence interval.

### A randomized placebo-controlled trial of arthroscopic lavage versus lavage plus intra-articular corticosteroids in the management of symptomatic osteoarthritis of the knee [^1173jj9a]. Rheumatology (2003). Low credibility.

The objective of the study was to assess the efficacy of intra-articular steroid injections following arthroscopy and joint lavage in symptomatic osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee.

Methods involved randomizing seventy-seven patients with knee OA to receive either 120 mg methylprednisolone acetate (MPA) or a placebo following arthroscopy. Clinical assessments included severity of pain during movement and at rest, stiffness, presence of joint effusions, range of movement, WOMAC (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index) score, and Lequesne functional assessment. The outcome measures were evaluated at baseline and at 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 weeks. Further arthroscopies and synovial biopsies were performed at clinical response and relapse.

The results showed that an intention-to-treat analysis was conducted on 71 patients (38 MPA, 33 placebo). According to the OARSI (Osteoarthritis Research Society International) response criteria, 58% of the steroid group versus 33% of the placebo group responded at 4 weeks, with an adjusted relative risk of 2.38 (P = 0.004). At other time points, there were no significant differences between the treatment groups. No significant differences were found between the two treatment groups in terms of pain, stiffness, or WOMAC or Lequesne assessments at any time point.

The conclusions indicated that the response to intra-articular corticosteroids following joint lavage is short-lived (2–4 weeks), with the achievement of an OARSI response criterion being the only difference between the two groups.

### Knee effusion affects knee mechanics and muscle activity during gait in individuals with knee osteoarthritis [^115UrRt1]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2012). Low credibility.

To test the hypothesis that knee effusion presence in those with knee osteoarthritis (OA) alters knee joint muscle activation patterns and sagittal plane mechanics during gait, a study was conducted.

- **Methods**: Thirty-five patients with medial compartment knee OA were assessed for the presence of effusion using a brush test. Based on the results, they were assigned to the knee effusion (n = 17) and no knee effusion (n = 18) groups. Electromyograms from seven lower extremity muscles (lateral and medial gastrocnemius, vastus lateralis and medialis, rectus femoris, and the lateral and medial hamstrings), leg motion, and ground reaction forces were recorded during self-selected walking. Isometric knee extensor, plantar flexor, and knee flexor strength were measured. Discrete measures from angular knee motion and net external moment of force waveforms were identified. Principal component analysis extracted electromyographic waveform features. Analysis of variance models tested for main effects (group, muscle) and interactions (α = 0.05). Bonferroni post-hoc testing was employed.

- **Results**: No differences in age, body mass index, knee pain, Western Ontario McMaster Osteoarthritis Index scores, gait velocity, and muscle strength were found between groups (P > 0.05). Individuals with effusion had greater overall quadriceps activation and prolonged hamstring activation into mid-stance (P < 0.05). Knee joint flexion angles were higher (P < 0.05), and net external knee extension (KE) moments in mid to late stance were lower in the effusion group.

In conclusion, quadriceps and hamstrings activation during walking show significant differences based on the presence of knee effusion in individuals with knee osteoarthritis.

### Volume and distribution of early knee effusion after TKA with a PEEK-based knee prosthesis: Correlation with changes in serum inflammation marker levels, knee functional score, and range of motion [^1125jvLz]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery. American Volume (2025). High credibility.

The volume of knee effusion in the suprapatellar bursal or patellofemoral region was negatively correlated with the change in the KSS functional score, and the change in the volume of knee effusion in the suprapatellar bursal region was negatively correlated with the ROM. These results indicated that the reduction in knee effusion contributed to knee function improvement after TKA. Improved prosthetic knee function results from well-balanced soft tissue in TKA, effective pain alleviation, early mobilization, and prevention of arthrofibrosis. Among all influential factors, arthrofibrosis prevention has been considered the most important factor in avoiding stiff knees postoperatively and achieving good ROM. Malahias et al. suggested that patients who develop stiffness 6 weeks after TKA have a distinct acute postoperative cytokine response profile. In the present study, the reduction in knee effusion and in CRP level or ESR indicated an alleviated inflammatory reaction in the knee joint. The decreased inflammation likely led to pain relief, which could have resulted in the observed improvements in the KSS subjective functional score and ROM.

Our study has several limitations. First, the sample size was small and the follow-up time was short. Since the PEEK knee system was applied clinically for TKA for the first time by our medical team, long-term results are unavailable. Second, although the correlation coefficients between knee effusion volume and CRP levels, as well as between knee effusion volume and KSS, were significant, all of them were relatively low.

The pediatric patient with fever and knee effusion is always a cause for clinical concern. A thorough history and physical examination are required to guide appropriate diagnostic evaluation and management. Although pediatric knee effusions are common in the setting of trauma, the presence of fever should prompt consideration of infectious, rheumatologic, vasculitic, and malignant etiologies. This review covers the key components of the history, physical examination, diagnostic strategies, common etiologies, and initial management of the pediatric patient with fever and knee effusion.

### Role of sonographic examination in traumatic knee internal derangement [^114oZwCd]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2007). Low credibility.

The objective of this prospective study was to define the accuracy of sonographic examination, compared with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), in detecting knee effusion. It also aimed to determine whether the presence of knee effusions in patients with traumatic knee injury can predict knee internal derangement as assessed by MRI.

The study was conducted in a hospital rehabilitation department with thirty participants (19 men, 11 women) who had traumatic knee injuries. These subjects received both sonographic examination and MRI on the same day.

- **Main outcome measures**: The presence or absence of knee effusion was assessed by sonographic examination, with MRI serving as the criterion standard to evaluate the presence of knee effusion and internal derangement. This internal derangement included tears of the anterior and posterior cruciate ligaments, as well as meniscus tears.

- **Results**: The sensitivity of sonographic examination for detecting knee effusion was found to be 79.1%, with a specificity of 50%. The positive predictive value (PPV) was 86.3%, while the negative predictive value (NPV) was 37.5%. The PPV of sonographic effusion to internal derangement was 90.9%, with an NPV of 37.5%.

- **Conclusions**: Sonographic examination can accurately detect effusion of the knee, and the detection of knee effusion in patients with traumatic knee injury by sonographic examination is highly indicative of internal knee derangement.

### Ultrasound of the knee during voluntary quadriceps contraction: A technique for detecting otherwise occult effusions [^113HkvKF]. Arthritis Care & Research (2010). Low credibility.

To describe a technique that can detect synovial effusions not visible on static ultrasound (US) examination and the characteristics of patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA) for whom this technique proved useful, a study was conducted.

From reviewed records of 76 patients with knee OA (112 knees) who underwent US-guided injections over a defined period, 45 knees showed no detectable effusion on static US. However, in 18 knees (14 patients), fluid was detected when scanned during voluntary quadriceps contraction. For all patients, effusion features were recorded (physical examination, presence and size on US), and the success of joint entry was determined by obtaining synovial fluid and/or observing an air echo or inflow of injected material.

The 14 patients studied were obese (mean ± SEM body mass index 32.7 ± 2.3 kg/m²; 3 morbidly obese), with moderate to severe OA as indicated by radiography in most cases (Kellgren/Lawrence class 3 or 4 in 10 of 14 knees for which radiographs were available). The suprapatellar synovial space observed by US was small (mean ± SEM depth 0.38 ± 0.04 cm). Arthrocentesis obtained 0.5–16 mL of synovial fluid (mean ± SEM 2.9 ± 0.6 ml), which correlated with the depth of effusion as seen on US with the quadriceps in maximum contraction (Spearman's rho = 0.5597, P = 0.0157). In 4 knees where arthrocentesis failed to retrieve fluid, the inflow of material and a linear air echo were observed during injection.

In conclusion, US of the knee during voluntary quadriceps contraction can identify effusions not detectable on static US. Such effusions provide targets for interventions.

### Joint effusion at 6 months is a significant predictor of joint effusion 1 year after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction [^113Gmp1G]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2021). Low credibility.

This study aimed to assess the risk factors for prolonged joint effusion in patients undergoing double-bundle anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR).

In total, 160 patients who underwent primary ACLR using autograft hamstring between 2015 and 2018 were retrospectively reviewed. Joint effusion was defined as any grade ≥ 2 (range, 0–3) according to the MRI Osteoarthritis Knee Score (MOAKS). Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed.

The median age of the patients was 25 years (range 14–68 years) at the time of surgery; there were 89 women and 71 men. At 1 year, 46 (28.8%) patients experienced knee joint effusion, as defined by the MOAKS. Univariate analysis revealed that age, preoperative Kellgren-Lawrence (K-L) grade, and joint effusion at 6 months were significantly associated with joint effusion at 1 year. In the multivariate analysis, joint effusion at 6 months was significantly associated with joint effusion at 1 year (odds ratio, 68.0; 95% confidence interval, 22.1–209.4). No significant difference in the Lysholm scores was observed between patients with and without joint effusion at 1 year (n.s.).

Joint effusion at 6 months was significantly associated with joint effusion 1 year after ACLR.

Level of evidence III.

### Volume and distribution of early knee effusion after TKA with a PEEK-based knee prosthesis: Correlation with changes in serum inflammation marker levels, knee functional score, and range of motion [^1177SwYU]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery. American Volume (2025). High credibility.

A major advantage of the PEEK prosthesis is its transparency on radiographs and MR, which avoids the metallic artifacts seen in MR images of joints with traditional alloy prostheses. Wittstein et al. revealed that 3D models of knee effusion generated using MR imaging with the SPACE (sampling perfection with application-optimized contrast using different flip angle evolution) sequence and T2WTSE (T2-weighted turbo spin echo) provided accurate estimates of knee effusion volume in a cadaveric study. The relatively precise quantification of knee effusion with MR imaging may be based on the T2WTSE or T2WFSE (T2-weighted fast spin echo) sequence for scanning and 3D reconstruction. In the present study, a T2-weighted PDW-FSE sequence was utilized to optimize the segmentation of the knee effusion image. Sagittal images were used to generate the 3D models since axial images might have left the suprapatellar recess uncovered. The 3D MR imaging models displayed the distribution and volume of effusion in the knee with the PEEK prosthesis.

Using 3D model analysis, dynamic changes in knee effusion were identified, which were characterized by an early rise in the mean volume to 31.86 ± 15.34 mL at 1 week postoperatively, followed by a gradual decrease to 11.45 ± 5.19 mL at 2 years postoperatively.

### Volume and distribution of early knee effusion after TKA with a PEEK-based knee prosthesis: Correlation with changes in serum inflammation marker levels, knee functional score, and range of motion [^111X5MiJ]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery. American Volume (2025). Low credibility.

After total knee arthroplasty (TKA), knee effusion may occur as a result of inflammatory reactions within the prosthetic joint. Excessive knee effusion may result in late postoperative pain, limited postoperative joint motion, and even implant failure. Accurate evaluation of knee effusion is crucial. However, obtaining clear knee-effusion image information through magnetic resonance (MR) is difficult due to the metallic artifacts from traditional alloy knee prostheses. The specific distribution, volume, and dynamic changes in knee effusion after TKA remain unclear. Moreover, the extent to which effusion relates to periprosthetic knee inflammation and function is unknown.

Applying substitute materials with good radiographic transparency characteristics is a possible solution. Polyetheretherketone (PEEK) is a polyaromatic semicrystalline thermoplastic polymer with beneficial properties, such as radiographic transparency, high strength, resistance to fatigue strain, suitability for common sterilization techniques, and excellent biocompatibility, that make it useful for biomedical applications. Currently, several orthopedic applications of PEEK are available, including the use of PEEK for the femoral component of hip prostheses, bone anchors, and spinal implants. Our previous study demonstrated good biosafety in goats that underwent TKA with cemented PEEK-on-highly cross-linked polyethylene (HXLPE) prosthetic knee joints. An animal model study proved the feasibility of in vivo MR image monitoring after TKA. We recently performed TKA with the PEEK-based implant for the…

### The association of meniscal damage with joint effusion in persons without radiographic osteoarthritis: the Framingham and MOST osteoarthritis studies [^113Ghj8g]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2009). Low credibility.

To assess the cross-sectional association between meniscal status and joint effusion on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in knees without radiographic osteoarthritis (OA), knees without OA (Kellgren/Lawrence grade 0) from the Framingham and MOST studies were examined by MRI. Meniscal status was assessed with a score of 0–4 in the anterior horn/body/posterior horn of the medial/lateral meniscus, and effusion was assessed using a score of 0–3. The odds ratios (ORs) of joint effusion in those with meniscal damage were estimated using a logistic regression model. A sub-analysis was performed for knees without MRI-detected cartilage damage.

Of 1368 knees, 296 (21.6%) showed meniscal pathology in at least one subregion. Effusion was present in 133 (44.9%) of knees with meniscal damage versus 328 (30.6%) in those without meniscal damage. The adjusted OR of effusion in a knee with meniscal damage was 1.8, with 95% confidence intervals (CI) [1.4, 2.4]. The OR of effusion for the group with meniscal pathology in two compartments was 5.4, with 95% CI [2.1, 14.3]. For knees without any cartilage lesions but with meniscal damage in any compartment, the OR was 2.3, with 95% CI [1.1, 4.5].

Knees without OA but with meniscal pathology exhibit joint effusion to a significantly higher degree than knees without meniscal damage. The association persists for knees without cartilage damage. The prevalence of effusion is further increased when present in two compartments. Concomitant occurrence of synovial activation and meniscal damage contributes to understanding the pathophysiology.

### Viscosupplementation for knee osteoarthritis: a systematic review [^114RWFm8]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2007). Low credibility.

Due to the rising number of patients affected by osteoarthritis (OA), appropriate management decisions for minimizing pain and improving physical function for patients with OA are important. Hyaluronic acid (HA) knee injections have become a common tool for the management of OA of the knee, and the number of randomized controlled trials on the efficacy and safety of this treatment is growing. We performed a systematic review of the five published meta-analyses, which include single- or double-blinded randomized trials performed at one center or multiple centers (Level I evidence).

Within each meta-analysis, a quality assessment tool for each trial was used based on outcome measures of OA-related pain, disease severity, trial period, and mean efficacy. We analyzed and compared the data collection and qualitative analysis methods, outcomes, and conclusions presented for each meta-analysis. Although they used different strategies, each used scientifically sound methods for analysis of many of the same trials; however, each used a different measure of trial quality and heterogeneity. Despite these differences, all come to a similar conclusion that when the strictest quality tools and interpretation of heterogeneity are used, Level I evidence demonstrates that the use of HA in patients with OA results in modest improvement in validated outcomes.

### Associations between knee effusion-synovitis and joint structural changes in patients with knee osteoarthritis [^116HsP7Z]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2017). High credibility.

To describe the associations between effusion-synovitis and joint structural abnormalities in patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA) over 24 months, a post hoc analysis was conducted using data from a randomized controlled trial involving 413 patients with symptomatic OA (aged 63 ± 7 years, 208 women). Assessments included knee effusion-synovitis volume and score, cartilage defects, cartilage volume, and bone marrow lesions (BML) using magnetic resonance imaging. Joint space narrowing (JSN) and osteophytes were evaluated using radiography. The least significant change criterion defined changes in effusion-synovitis volume, while knee symptoms were assessed by the Western Ontario and McMaster University OA Index. Multivariable linear/logistic regression and multilevel generalized mixed-effects models were employed in longitudinal analyses.

The total effusion-synovitis volume increased modestly from baseline (8.0 ± 8.5 ml) to follow-up (9.0 ± 10.5 ml). Baseline BML, cartilage defect, JSN, and osteophyte scores were positively associated with changes in effusion-synovitis volume (p < 0.05). Baseline cartilage defects and JSN were also associated with changes in effusion-synovitis score (p < 0.05). However, neither baseline effusion-synovitis score nor volume consistently predicted changes in the above structures except cartilage volume. In the mixed-effects models, knee effusion-synovitis was positively associated with BML (volume: β = 1.19 ml/grade; score: OR = 1.75/grade) and cartilage defects (volume: β = 1.87 ml/grade; score: OR = 2.22/grade), while negatively associated with cartilage volume.

### Metabolic and inflammatory profiles define phenotypes with clinical relevance in female knee osteoarthritis patients with joint effusion [^112wJQCZ]. Rheumatology (2023). Low credibility.

Despite these efforts, there is currently no consensus on a comprehensive classification of osteoarthritis (OA) with clinical relevance. In knee osteoarthritis (KOA), the existence of an inflammatory clinical phenotype characterized by the presence of synovitis and higher levels of pain, functional disability, and rate of progression is widely acknowledged. In our study, a data-driven approach was used to identify phenotypes in 168 KOA patients with persistent joint effusion from a prospective KOA cohort. To achieve this, anthropometric parameters, metabolic factors, and systemic and local inflammatory markers were analyzed using well-established statistical and machine learning methods in a non-supervised manner.

To assess their clinical relevance, differences across phenotypes were evaluated regarding pain, functional disability, ultrasound and radiographic severity, and progression.

### Synovial fluid proteomics from serial aspirations of ACL-injured knees identifies candidate biomarkers [^11314N7F]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears often result in knee effusion and an increased risk for developing knee osteoarthritis (OA) in the long run. The molecular profile of these effusions could provide insights into the initial steps in the development of posttraumatic OA after an ACL tear.

- **Hypothesis**: The proteomics of knee synovial fluid changes over time after an ACL injury.

- **Study design**: Descriptive laboratory study.

- **Methods**: Synovial fluid was collected from patients with an acute traumatic ACL tear presenting to the office for evaluation (18.31 ± 19.07 days from injury) (aspiration 1) and again at the time of surgery (35.41 ± 58.15 days after aspiration 1) (aspiration 2). High-resolution liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry was used to assess the quantitative protein profile of synovial fluid, and differences in protein profile between the two aspirations were determined computationally.

- **Results**: A total of 58 synovial fluid samples collected from 29 patients (12 male, 17 female; 12 isolated ACL tear, 17 combined ACL and meniscal tear) with a mean age and body mass index of 27.01 ± 12.78 years and 26.30 ± 4.93, respectively, underwent unbiased proteomics analysis. The levels of 130 proteins in the synovial fluid changed over time (87 high, 43 low). Proteins of interest that were significantly higher in aspiration 2 included CRIP1, S100A11, PLS3, POSTN, and VIM, which represent catabolic/inflammatory activities in the joint. Proteins with a known role in chondroprotection and joint homeostasis, such as CHI3L2 (YKL-39), TNFAIP6/TSG6, DEFA1, SPP1, and CILP, were analyzed.

### Effects of acute joint effusion on balance in patients with knee osteoarthritis [^112JACHT]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2013). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of acute joint effusion on balance in patients with knee osteoarthritis. Forty-four female subjects with painful knee osteoarthritis participated in this single-blind, randomized, controlled clinical trial. All subjects were randomly assigned to either the injection or the control group. A volume of 20 mL of normal saline was injected into the knee joint cavity of the test subjects, who performed static and dynamic balance tests twice before and after joint infusion. The subjects in the control group performed the same tests without joint infusion.

- **Static measurement**: The outcome variables for static measurement were the mean speeds (millimeter per second) of the movement of the center of pressure in the mediolateral and anteroposterior directions and the mean velocity moment (square millimeter per second) under both eyes opened and eyes closed conditions.
- **Dynamic measurement**: For dynamic measurement, time (second) and distance (millimeter) of the center of pressure were used.

Significant interaction of the balance-test variables (mean speeds, velocity moment, time, and distance) between the groups and time (P > 0.05) was not found. There were no significant differences between the groups in any of the balance-test variables (P > 0.05).

This study showed that acute joint effusion has no effect on static or dynamic postural sway in patients with knee osteoarthritis.

### Effectiveness of aspiration in knee joint effusion management: a prospective randomized controlled study [^112y7z1S]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2014). Low credibility.

Knee effusion is a common symptom in various knee disorders of both traumatic and non-traumatic etiology. Although intra-articular aspiration is a widespread treatment approach, its beneficial effect has not been confirmed by a randomized controlled study. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of joint aspiration in acute knee effusion, in relation to traumatic or non-traumatic etiology.

One hundred and sixty-seven consecutive patients with acute knee joint effusion were allocated in a randomized controlled fashion into two groups. In the first group, joint aspiration was performed, while in the second group, no aspiration was performed. Range of motion, pain relief, use of analgesics, and edema were evaluated post-management. The Knee Society Score and the International Knee Documentation Committee Subjective Evaluation Form were also obtained. Additionally, a subgroup analysis of the results concerning the presence of trauma was performed.

Aspiration exhibited a temporary improvement in all clinical parameters evaluated, especially in post-traumatic effusion. However, this improvement lasted only for the first week due to the early re-accumulation of the effusion. There was no difference between the groups regarding clinical outcomes in either trauma or non-trauma patients at the end of the follow-up period. Aspiration aided in the earlier establishment of the diagnosis in non-traumatic cases of effusion.

Aspiration resulted in only temporary improvement of the outcome in the treatment.

### Volume and distribution of early knee effusion after TKA with a PEEK-based knee prosthesis: Correlation with changes in serum inflammation marker levels, knee functional score, and range of motion [^111awCkx]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery. American Volume (2025). High credibility.

Outcome measures and statistical analyses: KSS subjective functional scores and serum inflammatory marker values (CRP and ESR) were obtained. Routine blood tests were performed before and after surgery. Postoperative knee ROM was measured in the supine position without weight-bearing. A CRP level of < 5 mg/L and an ESR of ≤ 20 mm/hr were considered normal.

Postoperative knee effusion was measured using a 3D MR stereoscopic imaging technique. Successive T2-weighted (proton-density-weighted fast spin echo [PDW-FSE]) MR images of knee effusion in sagittal planes were clustered using threshold segmentation based on the highest-signal gray value of the water-only region at the femoral intercondylar fossa. After segmentation, a 3D model of the knee effusion was generated using Materialise Mimics.

To analyze the effusion distribution, the 3D models were subdivided into suprapatellar bursal, patellofemoral joint, and infrapatellar bursal regions.

- **Figure 1**: Schematic diagram of the technique used for making, reconstructing, and subdividing 3D MR stereoscopic images of knee effusion. MRI = magnetic resonance imaging, PDW-FSE = proton-density-weighted fast spin echo, P = patella.

We performed a statistical analysis of the CRP level, ESR, and KSS, as well as the preoperative-to-postoperative change in value for each of these measures at each postoperative time point. We also conducted an analysis of the real-time knee effusion volume at various locations and the change in volume relative to the 1-week postoperative value at each point in time.

### Lubricating ability of aspirated synovial fluid from emergency department patients with knee joint synovitis [^113LNw44]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2004). Low credibility.

To determine if joint effusions encountered in the emergency department (ED) requiring arthrocentesis possess normal lubricating ability or evidence cartilage degeneration, chondroprotection of articulating joint surfaces is provided by lubricin, a mucinous glycoprotein that is a product of megakaryocyte-stimulating factor gene (GenBank U70136) expression. Loss of synovial fluid's (SF) lubricating ability has been implicated in the pathogenesis of degenerative joint disease.

A retrospective ED observational study was conducted from May 1, 1999, to October 1, 2000, on adult and pediatric patients presenting with radiographically negative knee joint complaints and clinical evidence of joint effusion. Knee joints were aspirated by the emergency physician, and the synovial fluid was tested for lubricating ability and collagen type II degeneration. Lubricating ability was assayed in vitro using an arthrotripsometer oscillating latex apposed to polished glass under a load of 0.35 × 10⁶ N/m². Results were reported as the coefficient of friction (μ) relative to that of a 0.9% NaCl control; a negative delta micro (Δμ) value indicates lubrication. Comparisons of Δμ were made to normal SF and aspirates from patients with osteoarthritis (OA) and rheumatoid arthritis. Collagen type II fragments were measured using a novel sandwich ELISA.

Synovial fluid aliquots (n = 57) lubricated poorly with Δμ = -0.045 (95% confidence interval = -0.006, -0.083) compared to normal SF with Δμ = -0.095 (95% CI = -0.088, -0.101). Only 20.6% of knee joint aspirates possessed normal lubricating ability.

### Conflict of interest in the assessment of hyaluronic acid injections for osteoarthritis of the knee: an updated systematic review [^1172U71Q]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2013). Low credibility.

The search results of a recent systematic review of prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled trials on hyaluronic acid injections for knee arthritis were updated and reviewed for funding sources and qualitative conclusions. Forty-eight studies were identified: 30 (62.5%) were industry funded, and 3 (6.25%) were not. Fifteen (31.3%) studies did not identify a funding source. An association was observed between a reported potential financial conflict of interest of the author and the qualitative conclusion (P = 0.018). None of the studies with a reported financial conflict of interest of at least one author had an unfavorable conclusion; 11 (35%) of the 31 studies with no industry-affiliated authors indicated that hyaluronic acid injection for knee osteoarthritis was no more effective than a placebo injection.

### Viscosupplementation for knee osteoarthritis: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^115awaEA]. BMJ (2022). High credibility.

Trial sequential analysis focused on serious adverse events (15 large, placebo-controlled trials, 6462 randomized participants) revealed that the cumulative z score crossed the monitoring boundaries in 2018 (z score = 2.77, P = 0.006) before the required information size was reached, indicating that the significantly higher rate of serious adverse events in patients receiving viscosupplementation compared with those receiving placebo is a robust finding.

Given the weak association between viscosupplementation and pain reduction in knee osteoarthritis, any increase in risk of serious adverse events caused by viscosupplementation compared with placebo can be considered a clinically important increase. Cumulative z scores are calculated under a random effects model. Required information size (RIS) was calculated as the sample size that gives a trial 80% power to detect a 50% relative risk (RR) increase in serious adverse events, assuming a control event rate of 2.5% and a two-sided α = 0.05. O'Brien-Fleming monitoring boundaries are represented by dashed orange lines, with circles denoting the z score for each additional trial. A D² of 25% was assumed. Non-peer-reviewed reports had their disclosure year defined as the earliest year in which the document was first officially created.

### Novel joint cupping clinical maneuver for ultrasonographic detection of knee joint effusions [^117DDkHV]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Knee effusions occur due to traumatic and atraumatic causes. Clinical diagnosis currently relies on several provocative techniques to demonstrate knee joint effusions. Portable bedside ultrasonography (US) is becoming an adjunct to the diagnosis of effusions. We hypothesized that a US approach, combined with a clinical joint cupping maneuver, increases sensitivity in identifying effusions compared to US alone.

- **Methods**: Using unembalmed cadaver knees, we injected fluid to create effusions up to 10 mL. Each effusion volume was measured in a lateral transverse location with respect to the patella. For each effusion, we applied a joint cupping maneuver from an inferior approach and re-measured the effusion.

- **Results**: With the increased volume of saline infusion, the mean depth of effusion on ultrasound imaging increased. Using a 2-mm cutoff, we visualized an effusion without the joint cupping maneuver at 2.5 mL and with the joint cupping technique at 1 mL. The mean effusion diameter increased on average by 0.26 cm for the joint cupping maneuver compared to without the maneuver. The effusion depth was statistically different at 2.5 and 7.5 mL (P < 0.05).

- **Conclusions**: Utilizing a joint cupping technique in combination with US is a valuable tool in assessing knee effusions, especially those at subclinical levels. Effusion measurements are complicated by the uneven distribution of effusion fluid. A clinical joint cupping maneuver concentrates the fluid in one recess of the joint, increasing the likelihood of fluid detection using US.

### Identifying inflammation in knee osteoarthritis: Relationship of synovial fluid white blood cell count to effusion-synovitis on magnetic resonance imaging [^111KMngG]. Arthritis Care & Research (2023). Low credibility.

Inflammation is a potential pain generator and treatment target in knee osteoarthritis (OA). It can be detected on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and by synovial fluid white blood cell count (WBC). However, the performance characteristics of synovial fluid WBC for the detection of synovitis have not been established. This study was undertaken to determine the sensitivity and specificity of synovial fluid WBC in identifying inflammation in knee OA using MRI effusion-synovitis as the gold standard.

- **Methods**: We identified records of patients seen at an academic center with a diagnosis code for knee OA, a procedural code for knee aspiration, and a laboratory order for synovial fluid WBC in the same encounter, as well as an MRI within 12 months of the aspiration. MRIs were read for effusion-synovitis using the MRI OA Knee Score (MOAKS). We dichotomized effusion-synovitis as 1) none or small, or 2) medium or large. We calculated the sensitivity and specificity of synovial fluid WBC using MRI effusion-synovitis (medium/large) as the gold standard. We used the Youden index to identify the best cut point.

- **Results**: We included 75 patients. The mean age was 63 ± 12 years, with 69% being female. The synovial fluid WBC was higher in the medium/large effusion-synovitis group (median 335 [interquartile range (IQR) 312]) than in the none/small group (median 194 [IQR 272]). The optimal cut point was 242, yielding a sensitivity of 71% (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 56–83%) and specificity of 63% (95% CI 41–81%).

- **Conclusion**: The sensitivity and specificity of synovial fluid WBC provide useful diagnostics in identifying effusion-synovitis in knee OA.

### Viscosupplementation for knee osteoarthritis: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^113VtTL4]. BMJ (2022). Low credibility.

Thirdly, we found evidence for the non-publication of many adequately powered, industry-funded trials. Examples include large trials on viscosupplementation for knee osteoarthritis, but they were never fully published. ClinicalTrials.com identifiers NCT01934218 (n = 814), NCT01372475 (n = 800), and NCT00988091 (n = 596) had completed recruitment in 2016, 2013, and 2011, respectively. These trials, which tested different viscosupplementation formulations with distinct biochemical properties, reported similar or worse treatment effects on osteoarthritis pain than placebo. Only a subgroup analysis of one trial (NCT01934218) has been published, which is indicative of selective reporting. At the time of writing, at least 12 other unpublished trials were known to be completed, but their results were not retrievable (> 3000 patients randomized in total). Additionally, we could not include the data of three unpublished, industry-sponsored, placebo-controlled trials (two of which are large trials), which were previously included in the 2012 systematic review because formal approval was not given by the companies.

Fourthly, based on the trial sequential analysis, between 2009 and 2021 alone, more than 12,000 patients were subjected to intra-articular injections in viscosupplementation trials, which raises ethical concerns. Based on our trial sequential analysis, a sufficient number of patients have been accrued to confidently conclude that viscosupplementation is not only ineffective compared with placebo but might also be seriously harmful, and therefore should be used cautiously.

### An epidemiologic analysis of clinical practice guidelines for non-arthroplasty treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee [^116hwv46]. Arthroscopy (2014). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to analyze the practice patterns of non-arthroplasty treatment of knee osteoarthritis (OA) and to assess the impact of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons clinical practice guidelines on the management of knee OA, particularly concerning the use of arthroscopic treatment.

The United Healthcare Database (2004–2009, 11 million patients, 216 million records) was utilized for the study. Researchers performed searches using Boolean language for International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Edition, Clinical Modification and Procedural Terminology, fourth revision codes. A reference group was defined as patients treated with knee arthroplasty in 2009 and diagnosed with knee OA in the same record. Clinical practice patterns in the five years preceding arthroplasty were analyzed in this group.

The reference group consisted of 12,806 patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty in 2009 with a documented diagnosis of OA at the time of surgery. Prior nonoperative treatment strategies analyzed during the preceding five years (2004–2009) revealed the following: 10.0% of patients were prescribed physical therapy specific to OA, 2.6% received an unloader brace, 0.52% underwent acupuncture, 43.5% were administered intra-articular corticosteroids, and 15.4% received viscosupplementation injections.

During the five years before arthroplasty, 2,505 patients (19.6%) underwent arthroscopy and debridement/lavage, with 35% lacking a diagnosis code for mechanical pathology. Within one year of knee arthroplasty, 2,028 of the 2,505 knee arthroscopies (80.9%) were performed.

### Diagnostic value of history taking and physical examination to assess effusion of the knee in traumatic knee patients in general practice [^117ABcKd]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2009). Low credibility.

The objective of this study is to assess the diagnostic value of history taking and physical examination for knee joint effusion in patients with a knee injury who consult their general practitioner (GP). Additionally, the study aims to determine the association between effusion seen on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and internal derangement of the knee.

This research follows a prospective, observational cohort study design set in primary care, involving participants aged 18 to 65 years (N = 134) who experienced a traumatic knee injury and consulted their GP. Interventions were not applicable in this study.

- **Main outcome measures**: Patients filled out a questionnaire, underwent a standardized physical examination, and an MRI scan to assess the presence of effusion. Multivariate logistic regression analysis determined the diagnostic value of history taking and physical examination (P < 0.10), as assessed by sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, and likelihood ratios. The relationship between effusion and internal derangement of the knee was assessed using a chi-square test.

Results indicated that of the 134 participating patients, 42 had knee joint effusion seen on MRI. Multivariate analysis showed an association with knee joint effusion for the symptom "self-noticed swelling" (history taking) and for the "ballottement test" (physical examination). The likelihood ratio positive (LR+) was 1.5 for self-noticed swelling and 1.6 for the ballottement test. Combining these two improved the diagnostic value to an LR+ of 3.6. Effusion had a positive association with internal derangement of the knee (chi-square 9.5).

### Lyme disease presenting as a spontaneous knee effusion [^111LJQJk]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2015). Low credibility.

Musculoskeletal complaints, which are frequently associated with Lyme disease, often prompt patients to see a physician. In particular, transient episodes of spontaneous knee effusion are common early in the progression of Lyme disease, and, if left untreated, 60% of patients diagnosed with the disease develop Lyme arthritis. This disease is easily treated with antibiotics; therefore, inclusion of Lyme disease in the differential diagnosis as a potential cause of a spontaneous knee effusion can prevent the development of more severe symptoms associated with the disease. However, the time required to receive test results and the inconsistencies between serum and synovial tests can complicate diagnosis of the disease.

### Is local viscosupplementation injection clinically superior to other therapies in the treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee: A systematic review of overlapping meta-analyses [^111NTqb7]. Arthroscopy (2015). Low credibility.

To conduct a systematic review of overlapping meta-analyses comparing the treatment of knee osteoarthritis (OA) with intra-articular viscosupplementation (intra-articular hyaluronic acid [IA-HA]) versus oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), intra-articular corticosteroids (IA-corticosteroids), intra-articular platelet-rich plasma (IA-PRP), or intra-articular placebo (IA-placebo) to determine which meta-analyses provide the best evidence and identify potential causes of discordance.

- **Methods**: Literature searches were performed for meta-analyses examining the use of IA-HA versus NSAIDs, IA-corticosteroids, IA-PRP, or IA-placebo. Clinical data were extracted, and meta-analysis quality was assessed. The Jadad algorithm was applied to determine which meta-analyses provided the highest level of evidence.

- **Results**: Fourteen meta-analyses met the eligibility criteria and ranged in quality from Level I to IV evidence. In studies reporting patient numbers, there were a total of 20,049 patients: 13,698 receiving IA-HA, 355 receiving NSAIDs, 294 receiving IA-corticosteroids, and 5,702 receiving IA-placebo. Ten studies examined the effects of IA-HA versus IA-placebo: of these, five found that IA-HA improved pain and four found that IA-HA improved function. No clinically relevant differences in the efficacy of IA-HA versus NSAIDs regarding pain and function were found.

Regarding IA-HA versus IA-PRP, IA-HA improved knee function at two and six months after injection, but the effects were less robust than those of IA-PRP. Regarding IA-HA versus IA-corticosteroids, the positive.

### Low-dose spironolactone: Treatment for osteoarthritis-related knee effusion. A prospective clinical and sonographic-based study [^115H3wJz]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2016). Low credibility.

To evaluate the effectiveness of spironolactone as a treatment for osteoarthritis (OA)-related knee effusion in comparison to ibuprofen, cold compresses, and placebo.

This study was carried out on 200 patients, aged 40 years or older, attending the outpatient clinic of the Rheumatology Department of Sohag University Hospital with unilateral knee effusion related to OA based on clinical examination, musculoskeletal ultrasonography (US), and synovial fluid analysis.

- **Group 1**: 50 patients received spironolactone 25 mg daily for 2 weeks.
- **Group 2**: 50 patients took ibuprofen 1200 mg daily for 2 weeks.
- **Group 3**: 50 patients used cold compresses 2 times daily for 2 weeks.
- **Group 4**: 50 patients received placebo for the same duration.

Fluid greater than 4 mm was considered as effusion. A decrease in fluid to below 4-mm thickness was considered complete improvement, and any decrease that did not reach below 4 mm thickness was considered partial improvement.

The mean age of the participants was 51.2 ± 8.1 years. The mean duration of effusion was 16.5 ± 3.6 days.

- **Group 1 Results**: 66% had complete improvement, 20% partial improvement, and 14% no response.
- **Group 2 Results**: 24% had complete improvement, 12% partial improvement, and 64% no response.
- **Group 3 Results**: 28% had complete improvement, 14% partial improvement, and 58% no response.
- **Group 4 Results**: Only 6% had complete improvement, 10% partial improvement, and 84% no response.

Low-dose spironolactone is a safe and effective medical treatment for OA-related knee effusion.
