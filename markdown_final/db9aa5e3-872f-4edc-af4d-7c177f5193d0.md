## Question

what imaging study should i order for a patient with a wound to the right medial buttock with tunneling of 7 cm depth concerning for vesicocutaneous fistula? i was going to order ct pelvis with iv contrast and fistulogram to the right medial buttock. does that work or is there something better?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which imaging study to order for a suspected vesicocutaneous fistula arising from a 7 cm tunneling wound in the right medial buttock, and whether CT pelvis with IV contrast plus a fistulogram is appropriate or if there is a better option. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical scenario and anatomic demands of a long buttock tract potentially communicating with the bladder. Then, I should verify what authoritative guidelines recommend for urinary fistula and penetrating bladder trauma imaging. Next, I will review the strengths and limitations of the proposed CT with IV contrast and a fistulogram, followed by examining evidence for MRI pelvis and CT cystography protocols. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, prioritized imaging approach, including complementary combinations and reporting considerations for surgical planning [^112JwwUd] [^115qgw12].

> Let me first confirm the clinical implications: a 7 cm tract in the medial buttock is complex by definition, with risk for secondary extensions, undrained sepsis, and a deep pelvic communication requiring cross-sectional mapping and definitive bladder assessment, not merely cutaneous tract opacification. Hold on, I should verify guideline direction here; the EAU/EAUN 2025 guidance emphasizes three-dimensional imaging to diagnose and localize urinary fistulas and supports MRI when diagnosis is challenging or additional information is needed, which fits this deep, atypical tract scenario. Penetrating trajectories from buttock or thigh to bladder are unusual but documented and often delayed in presentation, reinforcing the need for comprehensive cross-sectional evaluation to define the full extent and intravesical communication prior to intervention [^111TgsBn] [^112JwwUd] [^11786ZdX].

> Now, I will examine the proposed "CT pelvis with IV contrast alone" and ask: will it reliably demonstrate a bladder leak or a tiny vesical opening. Wait, let me verify the trauma guidance; both ACR Appropriateness Criteria and trauma literature are clear that suspected bladder injury, particularly penetrating, requires retrograde bladder filling with contrast (CT cystography) or a dedicated delayed excretory phase, because standard portal venous imaging frequently misses small extravasation or subtle dome or lateral wall defects. The EAU similarly notes that contrast-enhanced CT with a late excretory phase improves urinary fistula detection, so a routine IV phase pelvic CT without delayed or intravesical contrast risks a false negative and suboptimal tract-bladder correlation [^115qgw12] [^111FgJf7] [^112JwwUd].

> Next, I should review the value and limits of a standalone fistulogram to the buttock sinus. Let me think about this carefully: sinography can show cutaneous tract patency, but it is planar, lacks cross-sectional context, and is prone to false negatives if debris or edema prevents contrast passage. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; even when positive, it cannot assess deep pelvic anatomy, occult abscesses, or bladder wall integrity, so it should be considered complementary at best rather than a primary modality in this complex case where surgical planning hinges on deep pelvic relationships and the vesical interface [^112F81oA].

> I will now examine MRI pelvis as a first-line option for complex fistulas. MRI provides superior soft tissue contrast, multiplanar depiction of the entire tract, and high sensitivity for secondary extensions, undrained collections, and involvement of muscles or sphincters, all of which matter for a 7 cm buttock tract coursing toward the pelvis. Wait, I should confirm best-practice protocols: high-resolution T2 sequences in orthogonal planes with moderate bladder distension and IV gadolinium if not contraindicated are typically recommended, and MRI is repeatedly described as arguably the best modality for complex pelvic fistulas, including urinary and perianal, with downstream impact on therapy planning. If MRI is feasible, it can map the tract, define adjacent sepsis, and often localize the vesical opening to guide targeted endoscopy or intervention [^1164pjwb] [^117SBQcY] [^112JwwUd].

> But I need to ensure a CT-based pathway is clear if MRI is unavailable or contraindicated. CT cystography with retrograde bladder filling is the CT procedure of choice for suspected bladder injury and has proven utility in identifying bladder leaks and fistulas beyond the trauma setting, with excellent spatial resolution. Hold on, I should verify the technical steps: catheterize the bladder, instill dilute iodinated contrast, obtain adequate distension, and include delayed imaging to capture small-volume extravasation, which increases diagnostic yield for subtle tracts. This can be performed as a one-stop study and, if needed, can be complemented by simultaneous CT fistulography through the cutaneous opening to demonstrate convergence of contrast columns from skin to bladder on the same dataset [^115qgw12] [^111FgJf7] [^112HxxmS].

> Let me consider combined or staged approaches when single-modality certainty is insufficient. CT cystography combined with CT fistulography during the same session provides both intravesical and extravesical opacification with cross-sectional correlation, reducing false negatives from a blocked tract or low-pressure leaks. Alternatively, if MRI delineates the tract and peri-tract sepsis but the vesical opening remains equivocal, a limited targeted fistulogram or cystoscopic dye test can be used as problem-solving adjuncts, aligning imaging with endoscopic localization of the intravesical orifice for definitive management planning [^114n4msp] [^112HxxmS] [^114hTUut].

> I should double-check whether standard contrast-enhanced CT with only delayed excretory images could suffice as a compromise. Hmm, wait a minute, that might help for urinary leaks, but without active bladder distension via retrograde filling, small extraperitoneal leaks and tiny vesical fistulous openings can still be missed, especially in penetrating trajectories with scarred or low-flow tracts, so relying on IV-enhanced delayed images alone is a step down from CT cystography for this indication. Therefore, I should correct my initial thought and reinforce that CT cystography remains the preferred CT approach when bladder communication is in question, with MRI as the superior modality for soft tissue tract mapping and abscess detection when available [^115qgw12] [^112JwwUd].

> My final recommendation hierarchy is as follows. First, MRI pelvis with and without IV contrast, with moderate bladder distension, as the most comprehensive modality to map the entire 7 cm tract, detect secondary extensions and occult abscesses, and localize the vesical interface for surgical planning. Second, if MRI is unavailable or contraindicated, CT cystography with adequate retrograde bladder distension and delayed imaging should be performed, ideally adding same-session CT fistulography through the cutaneous opening to demonstrate tract-bladder continuity on a single study. Third, a standalone fluoroscopic fistulogram should be reserved as a limited, complementary test rather than the primary study in this complex scenario. Practically, this means replacing the proposed CT pelvis with IV contrast alone with either MRI pelvis or CT cystography, and using fistulography only as an adjunct when cross-sectional imaging leaves a specific uncertainty to resolve [^1164pjwb] [^115qgw12] [^112F81oA].

> Next, I should review adjunct diagnostic steps that can tighten localization if imaging suggests but does not definitively show the intravesical opening. Cystoscopy with retrograde bladder filling using colored dye can confirm and localize a vesical fistula orifice, and when combined with imaging landmarks from MRI or CT cystography, can facilitate targeted therapy. Additionally, in postoperative or ambiguous fluid scenarios, checking creatinine in drainage fluid helps confirm urinary origin, ensuring we do not miss a ureteric or atypical urinary fistula masquerading as a soft tissue sinus [^114hTUut] [^111kTcTs].

> Finally, I should ensure reporting and planning are optimized. Structured reporting that documents the primary tract course, length, internal and external openings, secondary extensions, relationship to key musculature, and presence of collections improves surgical outcomes and communication, and these principles from anal fistula MRI reporting translate well here for a long buttock tract with suspected vesical communication. Clear depiction of tract-bladder relationships on MRI or CT cystography, including any convergence of intravesical and extravesical contrast, will directly inform whether conservative diversion, targeted endoscopy, or open/robotic fistula repair is appropriate, and helps anticipate the need for drainage of associated sepsis or removal of foreign material if present [^11645DTS] [^112HxxmS].

For a suspected vesicocutaneous fistula, **CT cystography is the preferred initial imaging** [^115qgw12] because it directly visualizes bladder-to-skin communication [^112HxxmS] and is recommended by ACR for suspected bladder injury or fistula [^116uwcp2]. MRI pelvis is the **best adjunct** [^112JwwUd] for detailed soft-tissue mapping of complex or deep tracts, especially with a 7 cm tunnel, and is superior to standard CT for fistula anatomy and surgical planning [^1164pjwb] [^117A4TRs]. CT pelvis with IV contrast alone is less sensitive for fistula detection [^1166UYd9], and a fistulogram is optional if the external opening is accessible [^112F81oA]. Cystoscopy can confirm the internal opening if needed [^114hTUut].

## Recommended imaging studies

| **Imaging modality** | **Indication** | **Technique** | **Advantages** | **Limitations** |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| CT cystography | Suspected vesicocutaneous fistula or bladder injury [^116uwcp2] [^111TgsBn] | Retrograde bladder filling with dilute iodinated contrast, then CT acquisition [^112HxxmS] [^117P5Y42] | Directly visualizes bladder-to-skin communication, detects leaks, and defines tract course [^112HxxmS] | Limited soft-tissue detail; may miss small or complex tracts [^1164pjwb] |
| MRI pelvis | Complex or deep fistula tracts, detailed soft-tissue mapping, surgical planning [^112JwwUd] | Multiplanar T2-weighted and post-contrast T1-weighted sequences [^11645DTS] | Superior soft-tissue contrast, precise tract mapping, and detection of associated abscesses or inflammation [^1164pjwb] [^117SBQcY] [^116RCps9] | Longer acquisition time, higher cost, and limited availability |

### CT pelvis with IV contrast

CT pelvis with IV contrast is **indicated** for general pelvic evaluation and detection of abscesses or collections [^114n4msp], but its **limitations** include lower sensitivity for direct fistula visualization compared with CT cystography or MRI [^1166UYd9] [^112HxxmS].

---

### Fistulogram

A fistulogram is **indicated** to directly visualize the fistula tract from the external opening [^112F81oA], but its **limitations** include invasiveness, limited soft-tissue detail, and incomplete delineation of complex tracts [^114n4msp].

---

## Recommended imaging sequence for this patient

Given the clinical scenario of a right medial buttock wound with a 7 cm tunneling tract suspicious for vesicocutaneous fistula, the following **imaging sequence** is recommended:

| **Step** | **Imaging modality** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| 1 | CT cystography | Initial imaging [^115qgw12] to confirm bladder-to-skin communication [^112HxxmS] and identify the internal opening [^116uwcp2] |
| 2 | MRI pelvis | Adjunct imaging to precisely map the complex tract [^112JwwUd], assess soft-tissue involvement [^1164pjwb], and plan surgical intervention [^116RCps9] |
| 3 | Cystoscopy (optional) | Direct visualization of the internal opening if CT cystography is inconclusive [^114hTUut] |
| 4 | Fistulogram (optional) | If the external opening is accessible, to further delineate the tract [^112F81oA] |

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

CT cystography is the **preferred initial imaging study** [^115qgw12] for suspected vesicocutaneous fistula because it directly visualizes bladder-to-skin communication [^112HxxmS] and is recommended by the ACR [^116uwcp2]. MRI pelvis is the **best adjunct** [^112JwwUd] for detailed soft-tissue mapping of complex or deep tracts [^1164pjwb], especially with a 7 cm tunnel. CT pelvis with IV contrast alone is less sensitive for fistula detection [^1166UYd9]; a fistulogram is optional if the external opening is accessible [^112F81oA], and cystoscopy can confirm the internal opening if needed [^114hTUut].

### Elucidating vaginal fistulas on CT and MRI [^1164pjwb]. Insights into Imaging (2019). Low credibility.

MRI arguably represents the best imaging modality to visualize the normal pelvic and perineal structures, including the anal sphincter muscles, and to elucidate suspected vaginal disorders. The strength of MRI lies in its ability to identify acute inflammatory changes, abscesses, post-surgical fibrosis, and neoplastic tissue. Therefore, if allowed by the patient's clinical conditions, MRI is the preferred imaging modality to investigate suspected urethro-, vesico-, ano- and recto-vaginal fistulas.

The most recent European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation (ECCO) guidelines recommend MRI as the first-line, most accurate modality for preoperative diagnosis of perianal involvement in Crohn's disease (CD), as it dramatically affects medical and surgical therapy planning and improves the outcome.

Apart from fasting for some hours before the examination, generally no special bowel preparation is required for MRI. However, some centers suggest that preliminary distension with ultrasound gel may ease the identification of the vagina. Ideally, the urinary bladder should be moderately distended. Patients are scanned in the supine position, with a phased-array coil placed at the height of the pubic symphysis.

The MRI acquisition protocol adopted on our clinical 1.5 T MRI scanner (Ingenia, Philips — the Netherlands) mostly relies on multiplanar T2-weighted images with a limited field-of-view (FOV). In the setting of known or suspected perianal inflammatory disease, axial and coronal images are utilized.

### Multidetector CT cystography for imaging colovesical fistulas and iatrogenic bladder leaks [^112HxxmS]. Insights into Imaging (2012). Low credibility.

Multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) cystography currently represents the modality of choice to image the urinary bladder in traumatized patients. In this review, we present our experience with MDCT cystography applications outside the trauma setting, particularly for diagnosing bladder fistulas and leaks. A detailed explanation is provided concerning exam preparation, acquisition technique, image reconstruction, and interpretation. Colovesical fistulas most commonly occur as a complication of sigmoid diverticular disease and often remain occult after extensive diagnostic work-up, including cystoscopy and contrast-enhanced CT. We consistently achieved accurate preoperative visualization of colovesical fistulas using MDCT cystography. Urinary leaks and injuries represent a non-negligible occurrence after pelvic surgery, particularly obstetric and gynecological procedures; in our experience, MDCT cystography is useful to investigate iatrogenic bladder leaks or fistulas. In our opinion, MDCT cystography should be recommended as the first-line modality for direct visualization or otherwise confident exclusion of both spontaneous enterovesical fistulas and bladder injuries following instrumentation procedures, obstetric, or surgical interventions.

- **Exam preparation**: Explanation of exam preparation, acquisition technique, image reconstruction, and interpretation.
- **Colovesical fistulas**: Preoperative visualization of colovesical fistulas, usually secondary to sigmoid diverticulitis.
- **Iatrogenic bladder leaks**: Visualization or exclusion of iatrogenic bladder leaks or fistulas.

Regarding specific circumstances for anorectal fistula, and more specifically in patients with concomitant anorectal abscess, the AAST/WSES 2021 guidelines recommend considering performing a fistulotomy at the time of abscess drainage in patients with anorectal abscess and an obvious fistula. This recommendation applies only in cases of a low fistula not involving the sphincter muscle (subcutaneous fistula).

### Accuracy of pre-operative fistula diagnostics in anorectal malformations [^114ou7gw]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Low credibility.

Methods - **Medical chart review**: Medical charts were reviewed regarding pre-operative clinical observations of stool-colored urine, urine in ostomy and UTI, X-ray reports of pre-operative VCUGs and high-pressure colostograms, and peri-operative examination findings of cystoscopies and endoscopies of diverted ostomies. Final ARM-type classifications during PSARP were noted.

Diagnostics - **Radiologic and endoscopic examinations**: Radiologic and endoscopic examinations were conducted, and the presence and location of a fistula was noted. VCUGs and high-pressure colostograms were performed according to standard clinical practice by five pediatric radiology specialists at an accredited radiology department. Colostograms involved a dynamic X-ray examination with a water-soluble contrast injection through a catheter with an inflated cuff balloon at the orifice of the passive stoma, creating intra-bowel pressure and a convex appearance of the atretic rectum, enabling fistula visibility. VCUGs were performed collecting evidence of vesico-urethral reflux and included retracting the catheter slowly in the urethra under dynamic X-ray examination, enabling fistula visibility. Cystoscopies and endoscopies of diverted ostomies, including fistula catheterization with a guide wire from the atretic rectum to the urinary tract, were performed during PSARP anesthesia by five pediatric surgeons or pediatric urologists.

### An unusual presentation of penetrating bladder injury with vesicocutaneous fistula: a case report [^116RCps9]. BMC Urology (2023). Low credibility.

Vesicocutaneous fistulas rarely communicate to the thigh but commonly exit the perineum, scrotum, buttocks, or hypogastrium. The time for the fistula to develop can be variable but usually precedes an abscess. We believe our patient did not leak urine because the fistula tract was blocked by the foreign body. For a simple fistula, a micturating cystourethrogram can be sufficient; however, in cases where the history is prolonged and the fistula is complex, a CT or an MRI is needed, as evident in our case where the history was long and presentation was rather uncommon.

Management depends on the presenting symptoms, the complexity of the fistula, and the underlying cause. Urinary diversion to reduce the hydrostatic pressure of the bladder is vital; therefore, a urethral catheter was kept for 21 days in our case. However, fistula excision surgery was not needed as the tract healed spontaneously after the removal of the foreign object (causal agent). VCF can also be managed surgically by fistulectomy with vacuum-assisted closure, or larger and complex fistulas may require musculocutaneous flap surgery.

### FIGO good practice recommendations to standardize the assessment of outcomes following vesicovaginal fistula surgery [^114hAUR5]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Low credibility.

- **Implementation and cost-effectiveness**: Although a variety of materials are required to carry out a complete postoperative assessment following vesicovaginal fistula repair, most of these resources are relatively low cost and should be widely available, including Foley catheters, dye, Sims vaginal specula, different types of pads, and locally available scales to weigh the pad. Procuring any missing materials can also be explored in the treatment facility or with supporting partners.

Utilizing these good practice recommendations will give clear direction to any fistula surgeon and care teams assessing patients after vesicovaginal fistula repair. As the protocol explains the different steps in terms of actions, time periods, and materials needed, the costs per patient/assessment can easily be calculated and budgeted accordingly. Free print versions of the flowchart in A4 and A3 format in English, French, and Portuguese are also available on the FIGO Fistula Resource Hub.

It is hoped that use of this expert‐recommended tool will enhance cost-effectiveness and treatment outcomes as it will reduce the risk of the surgeon inadvertently missing something critical during the assessment, which could lead to premature discharge of the patient and subsequent return visits in the future — if this is even possible — to undergo further investigations.

### ESGAR consensus statement on the imaging of fistula-in-ano and other causes of anal sepsis [^112NdMY3]. European Radiology (2020). Low credibility.

The group encountered some difficulty when it came to indicating the size of any extension encountered since their morphology is variable. While volume measurements may circumvent this, volume is used rarely in daily clinical practice and is less familiar to surgeons. Ultimately, we settled on maximal diameter as the best compromise. This issue is similar to the distinction between an "abscess" and a "track/tract" because there is no generally accepted definition that differentiates between the two. Ultimately, accurate identification and location of sepsis is more important than the precise term used to describe it. There was also some discussion as to whether the maximal diameter of an extension should be restricted to its cavity or include any fibrous wall. Members decided that cavity measurement best reflected the need for treatment, e.g. surgical drainage.

First-round consensus failed for a statement regarding fistula "activity". A number of recent publications have considered activity, notably in patients with Crohn's fistulas. The concept of activity is well established for enteric Crohn's disease. When applied to fistula-in-ano, it is defined as inflammatory activity within the fistula, reflected, for example, by T2 hyperintensity and/or enhancement following gadolinium contrast. While authors of these articles considered the topic important, other group members reported that their surgeons/gastroenterologists did not find this concept useful, as they were more concerned with whether a fistula was present and its morphology. Ultimately, the group achieved consensus.

### Guided treatment improves outcome of patients with enterocutaneous fistulas [^114uBWNh]. World Journal of Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Various techniques were used to diagnose the ECF and to specify the anatomical origin. In some patients, the intestine could already be partially observed in the abdominal wound, or macroscopic analysis of fistula fluid was possible. Bilirubin and amylase concentrations in wound fluid were measured in 17 patients; radiological examination was performed in 24, and a combination of both was used in 38 patients. In ten of these, the ECF was diagnosed after oral ingestion of methylene blue. Radiological examination was performed by fistulography in 14 patients and by CT imaging in the other 48. Radiological imaging of the ECF and abdomen occurred in almost all patients undergoing a restorative operation (n = 45, 92%), all ultimately by computed tomography.

Because of the high risk of postoperative complications, as shown after previous intra-abdominal operations, we refrained from performing a restorative operation in one patient, allowing the ECF to persist. An indwelling drain made the ECF properly manageable for this patient. Ultimately, conservative management achieved spontaneous closure in 23 (29%) patients (compared with 19 patients (16%) in the previous series, p = 0.023) following a median period of convalescence of 39 (range 7–163) days compared with a median of 18 (range 7–49) days; p = 0.007. Conservative closure was achieved predominantly in patients with a closed abdominal wall and/or large bowel ECF.

### Cystoscopic fistulography: A new technique for the diagnosis of vesicocervical fistula [^1148PfoE]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2001). Low credibility.

Most fistulas communicating with the bladder are large enough to be diagnosed easily, or small enough to close spontaneously without clinical sequelae. A vesicocervical fistula is an uncommon event and may be difficult to diagnose.

- **Technique**: During an operative cystourethroscopy procedure, suspicious areas of the bladder can be probed with a cone tip catheter and injected with contrast dye to visualize the suspected fistula communicating with the bladder.

- **Experience**: This technique was employed when a double dye test, an intravenous urogram, a cystogram, a computed tomography scan, and a hysterogram failed to localize the fistulous tract in a patient who was 3 weeks postpartum following a repeat cesarean with complaint of persistent urinary incontinence.

- **Conclusion**: Cystoscopic catheterization of suspicious lesions in the bladder may visualize an otherwise elusive fistulous tract.

### A case of vesicocutaneous fistula to the thigh [^113KkXev]. Urology (2009). Low credibility.

We report a case of vesicocutaneous fistula to the thigh that developed 7 years after an injury to the pelvis. A 34-year-old male patient was referred to our hospital because of a water-soluble yellow exudate from his left thigh. A urinary fistula was suggested by the results of an intravenous indigo carmine injection. Intravenous pyelography and computed tomography revealed the presence of a bladder deformation and a fistula originating at the ventral bladder wall and leading down to the left thigh. The patient underwent fistulectomy and partial cystectomy. To the best of our knowledge, no previous reports of vesicocutaneous fistula to the thigh have been published.

### Figo good practice recommendations to standardize the assessment of outcomes following vesicovaginal fistula surgery [^113RKa3m]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Low credibility.

Obstetric fistula is a debilitating childbirth injury causing immense suffering for women and girls with the condition. The majority of fistulas can be successfully treated with a surgical repair, performed by a competent surgeon who has undergone specialist training and works with a holistic fistula care team. In addition to surgical repair, a critical component of fistula treatment is meticulous postoperative assessment. This assessment is essential to accurately determine surgical outcomes, ensuring that further treatment and support can be provided as needed, reducing the risk of any patient being discharged with ongoing problems, such as urinary retention or residual/ongoing incontinence. Based on the opinions of experts in the field, these good practice recommendations provide a practical and standardized protocol for the correct assessment of surgical outcomes following vesicovaginal fistula surgery and appropriate subsequent management.

### Risk factors for obstetric fistula: A clinical review [^112cwcNM]. International Urogynecology Journal (2012). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on urinary fistula:

- **Definition**: Urinary fistulas are abnormal connections between the urinary tract and another organ or body surface.

- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of urinary fistulas typically involves tissue damage and necrosis, subsequently leading to fistula formation. This damage can arise from a variety of causes, including trauma, surgery, or infection. Obstetric fistulas often occur due to prolonged obstructed labor, leading to tissue ischemia and necrosis and the formation of a fistula between the urinary and genital tracts.

- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of bladder injury associated with gynecologic surgery is estimated at 3.2–4.8%. The prevalence of vesicovaginal fistula is estimated at 1 in 1,000 after hysterectomy and 1 in 1,000 deliveries.

- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for urinary fistulas include previous pelvic surgeries, radiation therapy, pelvic malignancies, and vaginal foreign bodies. For obstetric fistulas, risk factors include prolonged obstructed labor, teenage pregnancy, and home delivery without skilled birth attendants.

- **Disease course**: The clinical course of urinary fistulas can vary widely depending on the location and size of the fistula. Common symptoms include urine leakage, urinary incontinence, recurrent urinary tract infections (reUTIs), discomfort, and skin irritation or breakdown in the area where the urine is leaking. In vesicouterine fistulas, patients may present with hematuria, vaginal leakage of urine, and urethral passage of lochia.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of urinary fistula can be complex due to factors related to the underlying conditions, treatment methods, and patient-specific considerations. Careful assessment and management strategies are essential for effective resolution and minimizing the risk of recurrence.

### ESGAR consensus statement on the imaging of fistula-in-ano and other causes of anal sepsis [^1115SFbS]. European Radiology (2020). Low credibility.

Concerning future research, since pre-operative classification of fistula-in-ano and similar pathology by imaging is already excellent, further gains in diagnostic accuracy are likely to be limited. Our consensus suggests that future research is likely to center on the clinical utility of "activity" in the context of Crohn's disease. These guidelines will be updated by ESGAR to account for these and other related developments.

### An unusual presentation of penetrating bladder injury with vesicocutaneous fistula: A case report [^1122yGq2]. BMC Urology (2023). Low credibility.

Clinical photographs demonstrate significant findings:

- **Granulomatous induration observations**: At 10 o'clock position with a resection using a monopolar TUR set. Pyogenic granuloma highlights a highly vascularized proliferation of granulation tissue, characterized by ulceration and lobular arrangement (H&E stain, 40× original magnification). Dense sub-acute inflammatory cell infiltrate comprised of neutrophils, lymphocytes, and plasma cells is also observed (H&E stain, 100× original magnification).

An exploration of the sinus involved an incision made around the fistula, extending upwards about 2 cm. Upon dissection, a foreign body, initially detected with forceps, was found projecting toward the right lateral wall of the urinary bladder through muscle layers. Meticulous layered dissection revealed a round, old piece of wood measuring approximately 7 cm long and 6 mm in diameter. This was extracted without calcifications present. The fistula tract was curated, debrided, thoroughly lavaged, and hemostasis was achieved, followed by aseptic dressing. Histological analysis of the tissue sample from the fistula tract confirmed pyogenic granuloma with no signs of metastasis.

Post-operatively, the patient was managed with Sitz baths, a course of antibiotics, and analgesics. No leakage of clear fluid or urine from the fistula tract was noted, nor were there any adverse events. On the 21st day post-operation, the urethral catheter was removed, and the patient's recovery continued without complications.

### Volume assessment magnetic resonance imaging technique for monitoring perianal Crohn's fistulas [^117SBQcY]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2018). High credibility.

Pelvic MRI has been shown to be the most accurate method for classification of the primary tract and secondary extensions; the recognition and treatment of the latter being essential to ensure satisfactory healing. MRI scans inform clinicians about fistula complexity, for example, the number of tracts, presence of undrained sepsis, and the patients' response to treatment interventions. Importantly, MRI can evaluate deep tissue healing, which cannot be clinically assessed.

Assessment of radiological improvement is subjective, and wide variation exists between radiologists. Previous attempts to standardize radiological response, such as the Van Assche system, have been criticized due to insensitivity to change and represent descriptive scores rather than monitoring tools. Currently, there is no universally accepted or reliable method of monitoring long-term radiological response to treatment. However, it is our view that clinical monitoring alone is inadequate. Proper evaluation of interventions for perianal Crohn's fistula requires accurate monitoring of response, as does the development of tools that will enable prediction of successful treatment. Future research and development, therefore, need to focus on accurate forms of imaging to provide standardized, responsive, and accurate tools to assess radiological response to treatment.

The imaging module of the recently published fistulising CD core outcome set comprises two outcomes, 'Fistula response on imaging' and 'an activity-based MRI score responsive to change'. At present, perianal fistula complexity on MRI is judged based…

### ACR appropriateness criteria® dialysis fistula malfunction [^1144hzNZ]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2023). High credibility.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for acute kidney injury, specifically in the evaluation of fistula malfunction, the ACR 2023 guidelines recommend considering obtaining fluoroscopy fistulography or duplex ultrasound of the hemodialysis access in patients with suspected dysfunction of the upper or lower extremity hemodialysis access (arteriovenous fistula or graft). This is suggested by an abnormal clinical indicator or hemodynamic indicator, such as a reduction in dialysis vascular access blood flow rate or kinetics.

### Elucidating vaginal fistulas on CT and MRI [^115tuoij]. Insights into Imaging (2019). Low credibility.

Sinus tracts differ from vaginal fistulas (VF) in that they do not connect to an organ but are blind-ending or terminate into an abscess collection.

Rare conditions that may mimic a VF both clinically and at imaging are peritoneal and lymphatic fistulas, in which communication is established between the vaginal dome and a post-operative fluid or lymph collection. Differentiation relies on correct identification of the abnormal collection that does not fill with enhanced urine.

- **Differential diagnosis**: A rare case of lymphatic VF is illustrated in a 67-year-old with previous laparotomic surgery for advanced ovarian cancer. CT images show fluid-filled dilatation of the vagina, indicated by arrows, communicating via a fistula with an ovoid fluid-attenuation pelvic collection, consistent with postoperative lymphocele.

### Diagnostic lessons learnt from a series of enterovesical fistulae [^116eSCxJ]. Colorectal Disease (2002). Low credibility.

An enterovesical fistula (EVF) is an uncommon condition requiring careful and sometimes extensive preoperative investigation. Our experience over a 10-year period has been reviewed with emphasis on the diagnostic investigations performed.

Forty-two patients (30 male) have been studied, focusing on their presenting symptoms, diagnostic investigations, and subsequent treatments.

- **Results**: The sites of the fistulae were 37 colonic, 2 rectal, and 3 ileal. The most common presenting symptoms included pneumaturia (75%), faecaluria (63%), and urinary tract infections (57%). The positivity rates of the investigations performed were as follows: cystoscopy (89%), urine cytology (86%), barium enema (65%), computerized tomography (CT) scanning (55%), intravenous pyelogram (IVP) (35%), and cystography (27.5%). The underlying causes of the fistulae were identified as diverticular disease (71%), carcinoma (20%), Crohn's disease (7%), and radiotherapy (2%).

We recommend cystoscopy and urine cytology for faecal material as the first-line investigations in all patients with suspected enterovesical fistulae. CT scanning and barium enema should not be first-line investigations but may be performed subsequently to help determine the aetiology and plan surgery.

### ESGAR consensus statement on the imaging of fistula-in-ano and other causes of anal sepsis [^116LZdHT]. European Radiology (2020). Low credibility.

Practitioners often encounter difficulties when MRI is performed soon following a therapeutic examination under anesthesia (EUA). Differentiating between treated and untreated disease can be challenging. We could not identify any indexed research study that addressed this issue directly. Thus, the recommendation to delay post-EUA MRI until at least four weeks is based solely on expert opinion.

The group reached a consensus regarding a "minimum dataset" that should be included in the imaging report. These recommendations are based exclusively on expert opinion due to a lack of direct research on these items. However, a later research article by a group member found that structured imaging reports for patients with fistula-in-ano omitted fewer key features than narrative reports and provided greater utility for the referring clinician. Another article by a different group member advised on a minimum dataset necessary for an informative report. As outlined in Table 2, the present group identified items comprising a minimum dataset for MRI reporting of fistula-in-ano. The objective is to present imaging information in a format that is useful to the referring clinician. Hence, the group emphasized Parks' classification and clock-face nomenclature since these concepts are familiar to clinicians and radiologists working in this field. Accurately reporting the exact radial location of any fistula is crucial for effective communication.

### An unusual presentation of penetrating bladder injury with vesicocutaneous fistula: a case report [^115k3819]. BMC Urology (2023). Low credibility.

A 16-year-old female patient presented to our center with a non-healing wound on her right inner thigh for a year and a half. She reported sustaining an injury to that area after falling off a double-decked wooden bed at her boarding school, hitting the corner of the bed's frame. This resulted in minimal bleeding, and the wound initially healed within a few days. She did not report any other injuries and attended school normally. However, she experienced intermittent pus discharge and occasional swelling on her right inner thigh, which had been incised and drained twice at a nearby health center with minimal relief and recurrence. Throughout this period, she reported normal urinary habits, normal bowel movements, occasional low-grade fevers, a good appetite, and no history of body weight loss. There was no reported history of diabetes mellitus or hypertension, and no known family history of malignancy.

On examination, the patient was fully conscious, afebrile, not pale, not jaundiced, not dehydrated, nutritionally sound, and with stable vitals. Local examination revealed a pus-discharging sinus on the right upper medial thigh, measuring 1x1 cm, with exophytic granulomatous margins and surrounding scar tissue. A chronic sinus was suspected, and a pelvic X-ray was ordered, revealing normal osseous outlines. An MRI was requested, which reported a fistulous tract measuring about 10 cm in length with a foreign body originating from the right lateral wall of the urinary bladder, passing through the pectineus, adductor longus, adductor brevis, adductor magnus, and extending to the thigh.

### The development of a minimum dataset for MRI reporting of anorectal fistula: a multi-disciplinary, expert consensus process [^11645DTS]. European Radiology (2022). High credibility.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the gold standard imaging modality for anal fistula. Details of fistula morphology are communicated through the radiology report, which should be unambiguous, relevant, and concise, without placing unnecessary burden upon reporting radiologists. This is a challenge, as anal fistulae can be complex, and reporting requires precise description of the spatial configuration of key features. Both free-text and structured reporting have advantages and disadvantages. A minimum dataset — a set of features that should be reported for all anal fistulae — can be used in either style, emphasizing items that are most valuable.

Successful treatment of anal fistula relies on the accurate assessment of fistula anatomy, particularly in complex cases. Surgery guided by clinical examination alone has a higher risk of recurrence due to undetected tracts, with significantly improved outcomes when MRI is utilized. Studies have shown that the fistula recurrence rate is 13% when surgery is guided by MRI findings compared to 52% when there is discordance between imaging and clinical examination. Imaging has further benefits in supporting surgical decision-making for the use of sphincter-preserving procedures (SPPs). These minimally invasive techniques have variable efficacy and are usually favored where fistulotomy (requiring variable division of the sphincter muscles) is likely to result in continence disturbance. The feasibility of many SPPs is partly determined by specific anatomical features, such as tract tortuosity, diameter, and the presence of intersphincteric involvement.

### Enterocutaneous fistulas: A primer for radiologists with emphasis on CT and MRI [^112F81oA]. Insights into Imaging (2017). Low credibility.

Radiographic fistulography, also known as sinography, traditionally represented the mainstay technique to investigate enterocutaneous fistulas (ECFs). Currently, it remains useful as a complementary technique to confirm communication between the external fistulous opening (EFO) and a segment of the gastrointestinal tract.

In our experience, this technique is best performed with help from the referring surgeon, who probes the EFO and enters the ECF. Depending on its calibre, a venous cannula or angiographic needle, a standard syringe, a Foley-type catheter, or a paediatric or nasogastric feeding tube may be used. Then, a non-forceful manual injection of low-osmolar water-soluble iodinated contrast medium (CM) is performed under fluoroscopic observation. Inexpensive, rapid, and easy to perform, fistulography directly visualises the communicating small bowel or colonic segment and provides information on ECF anatomy, including calibre, length, course, and ramifications. False-negative studies may occur due to oedema, debris, or compression by abscess or mass impeding CM flow into the intestinal lumen. However, fistulography lacks cross-sectional visualisation of mural and extraluminal pathology upstream, downstream, and at the site of the ECF.

- **Figure 1**: Two fistulography examples. (A) Fistulography performed via a catheter piercing through the external fistulous opening (EFO) in a 74-year-old man with a history of repeated surgeries to manage bowel obstruction, adhesions, and anastomotic dehiscence, showing optimal visualisation of the course and length of the enterocutaneous fistula (ECF, arrow).

### Selective use of cystogram following segmental bowel resection in patients with enterovesical fistula [^1142aSMT]. Colorectal Disease (2019). Low credibility.

Patients undergoing resectional surgery for enterovesical fistulas generally have an indwelling urinary catheter postoperatively to prevent a refistula. The aim of this study was to assess the role of a cystogram as part of the postoperative follow-up of such surgery, determine when it should be performed, and establish how long the bladder should be drained after surgery.

A retrospective single-centre study was conducted on all patients undergoing ileocaecal or sigmoid resection for enterovesical fistula surgery. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of a recurrent urinary fistula.

Between 1994 and 2015, 46 patients (23 male; mean age 55.4 ± 18.3 years) underwent surgery: 23 (50%) for diverticular disease, 16 (34.8%) for Crohn's disease, five (10.9%) for malignancy, and two (4.3%) for previous radiotherapy. Closure of the bladder fistula was achieved through simple suture in 21 (46%) patients and with an omental pedicle in 16 (36%). The overall median duration of urinary drainage was 10.5 days, with an interquartile range (IQR) of 7.3–14.0 days. A postoperative cystogram was performed in 26 (57%) patients following a median duration of 10.0 days (IQR: 8.0–13.0). This procedure demonstrated persistent leakage in three patients, two of whom had undergone surgical closure of the bladder. This group required prolonged drainage of 7, 19, and 40 days. One patient, who had undergone surgery following radiotherapy for urothelial cancer, developed a malignant fistula at nine months, despite the postoperative cystogram being negative.

This study suggests that a routine postoperative cystogram after surgery for enterovesica fistulas may need to be reevaluated.

### Figo good practice recommendations to standardize the assessment of outcomes following vesicovaginal fistula surgery [^115Gdu4A]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Low credibility.

Utilizing established protocols to objectively assess surgical outcomes: Assessment protocols on how to objectively measure the level of urinary incontinence have been developed and published, including freely accessible publications by prominent fistula surgeons, as well as limited research reinforcing the effectiveness of such tools and their validity. However, the level of awareness about these resources and their use by the fistula community is unknown.

As approaches regarding how to determine surgical outcomes continue to be inconsistent, the aim of these good practice recommendations is to provide a detailed protocol with the objective of standardizing:

- **Assessment of surgical outcomes**: Following vesicovaginal fistula repair.
- **Interpretation of results**: Providing clear guidelines.
- **Ongoing management of patients**: Ensuring consistent follow-up care.

### An unusual presentation of penetrating bladder injury with vesicocutaneous fistula: a case report [^113brWTW]. BMC Urology (2023). Low credibility.

MR images of the pelvis and proximal right thigh – T2 and T2 fat sat images show a fistulous tract measuring 10 cm in length with a foreign body within the tract originating from the right lateral wall of the urinary bladder (images A and B) passing through obturator internus, obturator externus, adductor magnus, and gracilis muscles, with the tract exiting through the medial aspect of the right thigh (images D and E). Images C and F show the foreign body in the fistulous tract (blue arrow).

Laboratory workup showed hemoglobin of 11.5 g/dL, serum creatinine of 43 mmol/L, BUN of 1.95 mmol/L, and serum potassium and sodium within range. She was scheduled for cystoscopy, exploration, and fistulectomy. On examination under anesthesia, she was noted to have normal appearing external female genitalia and a 1 by 1 cm sinus on her upper thigh in the inner aspect, with exophytic edge, discharging pus and surrounded by firm scar tissue (Fig. 2). Cystoscopy revealed a 2 by 2 cm mass at 10 o'clock approximately 5 cm away from the trigone that was easily bleeding to touch. The mass was resected off the wall using a monopolar TUR set, and the fistula opening was appreciated (Fig. 3); a 2-way 16Fr Foley catheter was left in situ, and the tissue chips were sent for histopathology, which revealed pyogenic granuloma (Fig. 3).

### Enterocutaneous fistulas: A primer for radiologists with emphasis on CT and MRI [^114n4msp]. Insights into Imaging (2017). Low credibility.

Nowadays, the vast majority of patients should undergo CT or MRI studies to provide comprehensive cross-sectional information on ECFs and underlying disorders as a consistent basis for appropriate treatment choice and planning. Multidetector CT is preferred in uncooperative or severely ill patients, such as those in early postoperative hospitalization, because it obtains high-spatial resolution images in seconds, thus limiting motion or peristalsis artifacts. In the setting of ECF, intravenous contrast medium (CM) is warranted unless contraindicated.

Orally administered CM opacification may be helpful in patients with scarce intra-abdominal fat to ease differentiation of bowel loops from extraluminal structures and abnormal collections. Unfortunately, most patients who recently underwent surgery have ileus or obstruction and are unable to drink diluted CM. Alternatively, CT-fistulography with prior injection of iodinated CM, such as 3% diluted iopamidol or iohexol through the external fistula opening (EFO), represents a useful one-stop-shop technique that combines cross-sectional information with opacification of the involved bowel tract. Image reconstruction and study interpretation along the sagittal plane are strongly recommended, as it provides the best visualization of the ventral abdominal wall.

CT-fistulography technique is directly performed on the scanner table by manual injection through the EFO of diluted CM using a syringe and a venous cannula.

Enterocutaneous fistulae (ECFs) are abnormal sinus tract communications between the alimentary system and the skin surface that can cause significant management problems and costs to the healthcare system. Interventional radiology can play an important role in diagnosis and treatment when conventional measures fail and additional surgery is difficult or poses a high risk. The management of patients with fistulae requires operator ingenuity and dedication, a multidisciplinary team approach, and an understanding of the pathophysiology. This article reviews the major issues in ECF management and the role of interventional radiology.

### Elucidating vaginal fistulas on CT and MRI [^1166UYd9]. Insights into Imaging (2019). Low credibility.

Vaginal fistulas (VF) represent abnormal communications between the vagina and either the distal portion of the digestive system or the lower urinary tract but lack an accepted classification and standardized terminology. Regardless of the underlying cause, these uncommon disorders result in profound physical, psychological, sexual, and social distress to the patients. Since the diagnosis of VF is challenging at gynecologic examination, ano-proctoscopy, and urethro-cystoscopy, imaging is crucial to confirm the fistula, visualize its site, course, and involved organ, and characterize the underlying disease.

The traditional conventional radiographic studies provided limited cross-sectional information and are nowadays largely replaced by CT and MRI studies. Aiming to provide radiologists with increased familiarity with VF, this pictorial paper summarizes their clinical features, pathogenesis, and therapeutic approach. It presents the appropriate CT and MRI acquisition and interpretation techniques that vary according to the anatomic site and termination of the fistula.

The role of state-of-the-art CT and MRI is presented with examples regarding both entero- (involving the colon, rectum, and anus) and urinary (connecting the bladder, distal ureter, or urethra) VF. The resulting combined anatomic and functional cross-sectional information is crucial to allow a correct therapeutic choice and surgical planning.

### Elucidating vaginal fistulas on CT and MRI [^111xDv8C]. Insights into Imaging (2019). Low credibility.

Regardless of type, all vaginal fistulas (VF) cause distressing symptoms, including persistent vaginitis despite treatment, dyspareunia, and painful perineal dermatitis and excoriation. Enterovaginal fistulas (enterovaginal VF) are indicated by foul-smelling enteral or fecal discharge through the vagina. Fecal incontinence may develop secondary to associated loss of anal sphincter function.

The characteristic symptom of urinary fistulas (urinary VF) is continual leakage of urine from the vagina and vulvar irritation. In recently operated patients, specific symptoms of VF are often masked by common post-operative problems such as abdominal and flank pain, hematuria, worsening renal function, fever, and paralytic ileus. Not unusually, iatrogenic damage to the urinary tract is indicated by imaging detection of fluid collections representing urinoma. Biochemical assay of discharge fluid for creatinine levels and intravesical injection of methylene blue dye are helpful to confirm the presence of the VF.

The diagnosis of colonic fistulae is crucial in defining the best therapeutic approach. Fistulae can be suspected from clinical history or specific symptoms, but imaging plays a key role in confirming the diagnosis. Previous studies have described conventional studies with barium as the methods of choice for diagnosis; more recently, intestinal ultrasound, CT, and MR have been considered promising tests. CT colonography is the best radiologic test to evaluate the colon, but only a few case reports have described its role in this setting.

### FIGO good practice recommendations to standardize the assessment of outcomes following vesicovaginal fistula surgery [^113VVo4s]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025).

Obstetric fistula is a debilitating childbirth injury causing immense suffering for women and girls with the condition. The majority of fistulas can be successfully treated with a surgical repair, performed by a competent surgeon who has undergone specialist training and who works with a holistic fistula care team. A critical component of fistula treatment, along with surgical repair, is meticulous postoperative assessment. This assessment is essential to accurately determine surgical outcomes so that further treatment and support can be provided as required and to substantially reduce the risk of any patient being discharged with ongoing problems, such as urinary retention or residual/ongoing incontinence.

Based on the opinions of experts in the field, these good practice recommendations provide a practical and standardized protocol for the correct assessment of surgical outcomes following vesicovaginal fistula surgery and appropriate subsequent management.

### Elucidating vaginal fistulas on CT and MRI [^1167Rjo7]. Insights into Imaging (2019). Low credibility.

Fistulas of the female genital tract have been described in medical literature since ancient times. Among them, vaginal fistulas (VF) are the most prevalent and are defined as abnormal epithelium-lined communications between the vagina and other pelvic organs. The spectrum of causes encompasses congenital and developmental abnormalities, inflammatory diseases, infections, tumors, sexual and obstetric trauma, irradiation, and post-surgical injuries. Regardless of the underlying disorder, all VF result in substantial morbidity and severely impair the patients' quality of life.

The majority of patients with VF are initially referred to a gynecologist; however, despite more or less evident clinical signs, vaginal exploration may identify the fistulous orifice in less than 80% of cases. Similarly, visualization of the abnormal communication is generally quite challenging at either anoscopy or urethroscopy. As a result, clinicians and surgeons need critical help from radiologists to (1) confirm the presence of a VF, (2) visualize its site, course, and involved organs, and (3) characterize the underlying pathology.

Traditionally, imaging demonstrations of VF relied on fluoroscopic studies such as contrast medium (CM) enema, intravenous excretory urography, voiding, and retrograde cystography, which may opacify a patent fistulous tract but provide very limited information on the affected organs. Although developed as the best radiographic technique to confirm and visualize a VF by pressure, conventional vaginography is relatively invasive, cumbersome, and poorly informative.

### Incidental detection of a vesicocolonic fistula on renal scintigraphy with SPECT/CT [^1144UZm3]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

The urinary-enteric fistula is a rare cause of recurrent urinary tract infection (UTI); therefore, delayed or incidental diagnosis is common. The authors present an image of a vesicocolonic fistula incidentally detected during SPECT/CT renal scintigraphy using 99mTc-DTPA in a female patient with recurrent UTI. The diagnosis was subsequently confirmed by cystoscopy and surgery.

### Differentiation of perianal fistulas with digital subtraction magnetic resonance fistulography [^1165u8nn]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is accurate in identifying perianal fistulas. The exact visualization of fistulous tracts and concomitant abscesses determines the type of treatment. To improve the detection of perianal fistulas, we studied digital subtraction MR-fistulography for tissue differentiation based on signal intensity measurements.

- **Methods**: This study included 75 patients with the clinical diagnosis of perianal fistula. All patients were analyzed by a thin-slice, high-resolution, fast low-angle shot 3-dimensional sequence in the axial plane before and after intravenous injection of gadobenate dimeglumine, followed by image subtraction. Operator-defined regions of interest were used to calculate signal intensities of the inflamed fibrous walls of fistulas, the common femoral artery, the internal and external sphincter muscles, and the gluteus muscle. The fistulas were classified according to Parks classification.

- **Results**: Based on signal intensity measurements in 75 patients with perianal fistulas, diagnosed by digital subtraction MR-fistulography, a significant differentiation between fistulous tracts and anatomic structures was possible. MRI identified 116 perianal fistulas (34 intersphincteric, 33 transsphincteric, 10 suprasphincteric, and 39 extrasphincteric) and 35 abscesses.

- **Conclusions**: Digital subtraction MR-fistulography is a new, promising, noninvasive imaging technique for the detection of perianal fistulas and abscesses.

### An unusual presentation of penetrating bladder injury with vesicocutaneous fistula: A case report [^1162HGT1]. BMC Urology (2023). Low credibility.

Bladder injuries can be classified as either blunt or penetrating. Generally, the bladder is protected, but as it fills up, it rises into the lower abdomen, making it more susceptible to injury. Blunt bladder injuries are relatively common; however, penetrating injuries to the bladder account for 14–49%. The most common entry points for these injuries are the anterior abdomen, rectum, and buttocks. Therefore, injuries via the inner thighs are rare, and clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion for bladder injury regardless of the presence or absence of signs and symptoms in such patients. A comprehensive evaluation is necessary.

Thigh abscess can be a sign of intra-abdominal pathologies, such as diverticulitis or colorectal cancer. However, less frequently, it can arise from the urinary bladder. A fistula is an abnormal communication between two epithelial-lined surfaces. Vesicocutaneous fistula (VCF) can be acquired or congenital, characterized by an abnormal tract formed between the urinary bladder and the cutaneous surface of the body. Diagnosis can sometimes be challenging due to the obscure clinical history and presentation. Hence, higher modality contrast studies like CT scans or MRIs should be conducted as they will also aid in the management plan. Herein, we present an uncommon cause of vesicocutaneous fistula (VCF) in a schoolgirl who presented with a long-term sinus on her right inner thigh.

### Utero-cutaneous fistula following caesarean section [^111gM4NX]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). Low credibility.

A multiparous woman in her 20s presented to the clinic with bleeding from a caesarean scar site. After clinical examination and radiological evaluation with ultrasound and MR fistulogram, the diagnosis was utero-cutaneous fistula. Complete resection of the fistulous tract with uterine defect closure and supportive omental patch placement was performed following an intraoperative demonstration of the utero-cutaneous fistula by injecting methylene blue dye.

Utero-cutaneous fistula is a rare complication after caesarean section. Cyclical bleeding from an abnormal opening in a previous caesarean scar site is the classical presentation of this condition.

### Incidental vesicocolic fistula on routine bone scintigraphy: Value of additional delayed images and direct radionuclide cystography [^11698XR6]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

An unexpected vesicocolic fistula can be detected incidentally on routine bone scintigraphy. A 55-year-old man, who had undergone a radical colectomy for carcinoma of the sigmoid colon one year previously, underwent bone scintigraphy to evaluate bone metastasis. Whole-body images revealed an abnormal accumulation of radioactivity in the right lower quadrant of the abdomen, although the radioactivity did not precisely define a structure. Additional delayed images obtained 15 and 24 hours after the initial image localized a vesicocolic fistula. Subsequent radionuclide cystography confirmed leakage of radioactivity from the bladder.

### High resolution MRI for preoperative work-up of neonates with an anorectal malformation: A direct comparison with distal pressure colostography/fistulography [^115tqrkX]. European Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

The MRI studies were prospectively and independently analyzed by two readers (two experienced staff members of pediatric radiology and abdominal radiology, A and B), who were blinded to the results of surgery. Information regarding the clinically visible anal opening was provided to both readers to imitate clinical reality. However, information from other diagnostic tools was not available during the reading sessions.

Colostography/fistulography was prospectively and independently analyzed by two other readers (two experienced staff members of pediatric radiology, X and Y), who were also blinded to MRI or surgical results. The same information regarding the anal opening was provided as for the MRI readings.

- **Imaging classification**: Readers were first asked to classify the imaging findings according to the Krickenbeck classification.
- **Location evaluation**: Secondly, they were asked to evaluate the location of the transition of the normal rectal mucosa into the fistula. The transition was classified as above the pelvic floor, at the level of the pelvic floor, or below the pelvic floor.

Since no pressure was applied during MRI to dilate the proximal colon, differentiation between normal colon and fistula was based on the layered aspect of the bowel segment. If the different layers (mucosa, submucosa, and muscularis) were discernible, it was classified as normal bowel that could be used for anastomosis. If there were no layers visible, it was classified as a fistula. Using colostography/fistulography, the non-dilated part of the distal bowel was classified as a fistula.

In patients with a cloacal malformation, the length…

### ESGAR consensus statement on the imaging of fistula-in-ano and other causes of anal sepsis [^112TJ9mA]. European Radiology (2020). Low credibility.

The primary target audience for this guideline comprises radiologists interpreting medical imaging for the diagnosis of fistula-in-ano and other causes of anal sepsis. The group anticipates that these guidelines can be rapidly implemented in clinical practice since they predominantly describe MRI techniques and interpretation practices that are already in widespread clinical use. Importantly, there is no specified requirement for specialized equipment. Instead, this guideline outlines a "minimum dataset" for image acquisition and reporting.

Using a modified Delphi approach, consensus was achieved for 53 individual statements relating to the imaging of potential anal sepsis, notably fistula-in-ano. These guidelines cover ten areas of interest. The first area concerns clinical indications. While the exercise was initiated by a desire for guidelines around imaging fistula-in-ano, it is evident that imaging, notably MRI, is appropriate for investigating several other pathologies that may cause anal sepsis. In some cases, a differential diagnosis between fistula-in-ano and other pathologies (e.g. pilonidal sinus) may be necessary. In others, imaging is highly effective for diagnosing life-threatening conditions, notably necrotizing fasciitis, where free tissue gas is especially well demonstrated by CT. In Crohn's disease, imaging can be used to direct and optimize treatment strategy and to monitor the efficacy of the treatment. Several research studies have been conducted to investigate the effect of imaging in the context of potential anal sepsis.

### Enterocutaneous fistulas: A primer for radiologists with emphasis on CT and MRI [^1165mMHq]. Insights into Imaging (2017). Low credibility.

Nowadays, most patients with enterocutaneous fistulas (ECFs) undergo multidetector CT or MRI studies to provide a comprehensive cross-sectional assessment as a consistent basis for appropriate treatment choice and planning. Visualization of the underlying conditions, such as postoperative anastomotic leak, bowel obstruction, abscesses amenable to drainage, active or stricturing Crohn's disease, and fistulizing or recurrent tumors, allows directed treatment. This approach results in decreased rates of failed conservative management and a higher likelihood of therapeutic success.

### High resolution MRI for preoperative work-up of neonates with an anorectal malformation: a direct comparison with distal pressure colostography/fistulography [^1147EWAB]. European Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

MRI failed to make the correct diagnosis in four cases: a rectovaginal H-fistula, an anal stenosis, a vestibular fistula (insufficient image quality) and a bulbar recto-urethral fistula (closed bulbar recto-urethral fistula misdiagnosed as no fistula with rectal pouch below the pelvic floor).

Colostography/fistulography was incorrect in 13 cases: five bulbar recto-urethral fistulas [four misinterpreted as prostatic urethral fistulas (Fig. 3)], three with no fistula, two prostatic urethral fistulas [one misinterpreted as a rectobulbar rectourethra fistula, one uninterpretable (Fig. 1)], one cloaca, one rectovaginal H-fistula, and one anal stenosis.

The level of the rectal pouch was misinterpreted in four cases using MRI compared to surgery. One vestibular fistula with a fistula at the level of the pelvic floor was misinterpreted as a lower level fistula. One bulbar level with an obliterated fistula at the pelvic floor was misinterpreted as no fistula with a rectal pouch below the pelvic floor. One bulbar fistula with a rectal pouch on the level of the pelvic floor was misinterpreted as a bulbar fistula with a rectal pouch above the pelvic floor. Finally, one vestibular fistula with a fistula below the pelvic floor could not be interpreted with MRI. The reasons for the misinterpretation of the level of the rectal pouch when colostography/fistulography was used were diverse.

The failure of colostography/fistulography to determine the length of the common channel in a cloaca was due to an uninterpretable image.

### An unusual presentation of penetrating bladder injury with vesicocutaneous fistula: A case report [^113y74DV]. BMC Urology (2023). Low credibility.

Urinary bladder trauma can be broadly classified as blunt or penetrating, with blunt injury being the most common type. Penetrating injury to the bladder is relatively rare and accounts for 14–49% of bladder injuries. Clinical presentations of bladder injury include suprapubic pain, inability to pass urine, hematuria, and peritoneal signs and symptoms in the case of intraperitoneal injury. The index case is unique as there were no reported signs or symptoms suggestive of bladder injury.

The port of entry can either be the abdomen, perineum, rectum, buttocks, or pelvis, with the upper inner thigh as the port of entry being a very rare presentation. Our case was diagnosed with penetrating bladder injury following a year and six months due to the unusual presentation of both symptoms and signs and the entry point. Complications of bladder injury include persistent hematuria, infection (sepsis), and urine incontinence (fistula formation). Pereira et al. also state in their literature that penetrating trauma to the lower abdomen, thighs, or perineum is sensitive to bladder injuries. The most common cause of penetrating bladder injury is gunshot wounds (GSWs), accounting for 80% of cases, compared to 20% from stab wounds. One cannot predict the trajectory of a gunshot wound, whereas stab wounds can be predicted with relatively little damage to surrounding tissues compared to GSWs. Other causes include pelvic fractures and isolated bladder injuries from iatrogenic injury, though these are uncommon.

Diagnostic modalities for urinary bladder injuries can involve X-ray cystography, but CT-cystography is recommended if there is a suspicion of other visceral injuries.

### Diagnosis and treatment of enterovesical fistulae [^112Zt33S]. Colorectal Disease (2005). Low credibility.

Enterovesical fistulae are a recognized complication of a variety of inflammatory and neoplastic conditions. Despite advances in imaging and treatment, the diagnosis may be delayed, and the management remains diverse. We describe our experience with their diagnosis and management.

This retrospective study encompassed all patients referred over a 10-year period with clinical suspicion of or confirmed enterovesical fistula. Demographics, clinical presentation, etiology, and clinical outcomes were evaluated. The mean follow-up was 18 months (range 6–50 months).

Thirty patients were studied, with a mean age of 63.5 years (range 23–92 years). Fifteen (50%) patients presented with classical urinary symptoms — pneumaturia, fecaluria, and recurrent urinary tract infections. The most common investigations included: CT (15, 80% positive), cystoscopy (16, 87.5% positive), endoscopy (11, 54.5% positive), and barium enema (8, 50% positive). There were 20 inflammatory and 10 neoplastic etiologies. Five patients were treated conservatively, while 25 patients underwent surgery, which resulted in symptomatic cure in the majority of cases (22/25).

Classical urinary symptoms were only evident in 50% of patients with confirmed fistulae. We advocate CT scanning as the optimum imaging modality before surgical intervention. Surgical treatment in a specialized unit remains the most effective treatment of enterovesical fistulae.

### Multidisciplinary approach to evaluation of rectovaginal fistulas [^114Yk6KG]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2024). Low credibility.

Thorough evaluation of a rectovaginal fistula is essential to optimize surgical repair. The underlying cause should be addressed and treated, which can affect the timing and approach to repair. It is imperative to be well prepared because the highest chance of successful closure occurs during the initial repair attempt. Our objective was to demonstrate how multidisciplinary colorectal surgery and urogynecology teams use specific methods during the examination under anesthesia to evaluate a complex rectovaginal fistula and to optimize the surgical approach to repair. Anesthesia may be provided with monitored anesthesia care and a posterior perineal block. This pain control allows for a wide range of techniques to evaluate the fistula using anoscopy, a fistula probe, hydrogen peroxide, and sigmoidoscopy. In addition, the teams show how curettage and subsequent seton placement can encourage closure by secondary intention and decrease the risk of abscess formation, respectively.

### Concurrent vesicoperitoneal and vesicovaginal fistulae [^114X4Fxu]. International Urogynecology Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Although rare in the United States, vesicovaginal fistulae are usually associated with postoperative complications. Even more rarely seen, vesicoperitoneal fistulae can also present postoperatively. Both types of fistulae are diagnostically challenging and can be difficult to manage. We describe a case report of a patient with both vesicovaginal and vesicoperitoneal fistulae following a laparoscopic-assisted vaginal hysterectomy, who presented with abdominal pain and anuria. A cystogram and outpatient cystoscopy were imperative in the diagnosis. She was conservatively managed with continuous bladder drainage via an indwelling catheter, resulting in an ideal recovery without requiring reoperation.

### Retrograde vaginal methylene blue injection for localization of complex urinary fistulas [^117SsUyz]. Journal of Endourology (2003). Low credibility.

Ureterovesical and vesicovaginal fistulae are usually easily diagnosed with standard techniques, including radiology, the double-dye test, cystoscopy, and vaginal examination. However, in a few complex cases, the localization of the fistulous orifice may be extremely difficult.

- **Method**: We describe a novel technique of retrograde vaginal methylene blue testing that may assist in the proper localization of the fistulous opening.

- **Results**: Our experience with one case each of ureterovesical and vesicovaginal fistula easily diagnosed with this method proves its efficacy, simplicity, and safety.

- **Conclusion**: This technique should be reserved for cases of urinary fistulae when all standard diagnostic methods have failed.
