## Question

How long after po repletion does serum potassium corrects?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how long it takes for serum potassium to correct after oral potassium repletion and how to monitor and dose it safely. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacokinetics of oral potassium absorption and distribution. Then, I should verify how formulation affects onset and duration. Next, I will examine clinical monitoring guidance and typical time frames for rechecking potassium. After that, I need to consider patient-specific modifiers such as renal function, acid–base status, and magnesium deficiency. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, clinically grounded timeline and monitoring plan with safety caveats and references to guidelines and labels.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacokinetics. Oral potassium is absorbed in the small intestine, and the serum potassium rise reflects both absorption and rapid intracellular shifting via insulin- and aldosterone-dependent mechanisms, which blunt early increases in plasma potassium. Under steady-state conditions, gastrointestinal absorption equals urinary excretion, so net balance is maintained when intake is stable [^114PxTTA] [^112aMnj7]. Wait, let me verify the time course of absorption and distribution: immediate-release oral solution shows higher absorption and urinary excretion in the first few hours after dosing compared with modified-release products, indicating a faster early rise in serum potassium with solution formulations, whereas controlled-release tablets deliver potassium over roughly 8–10 hours, smoothing the profile but delaying peak effects [^117RtVrv] [^114PxTTA].

> I should confirm how formulation changes onset and duration. Immediate-release oral solution tends to produce a measurable serum potassium increase within 1–2 hours in many patients, though the magnitude is buffered by intracellular uptake. Modified-release tablets act more gradually over 8–10 hours, so the apparent "correction" on labs may be slower to manifest even if total bioavailability over 24 hours is similar between formulations, which I need to keep in mind when planning recheck timing [^114PxTTA]. Hold on, I should verify special populations: in cirrhosis, baseline-corrected serum potassium after an oral load rises to about twice that of normal subjects over 3 hours, suggesting a more pronounced early serum increase and a need for closer monitoring in hepatic disease [^114PxTTA].

> Next, I should review monitoring guidance to anchor expectations. FDA labeling for oral potassium chloride instructs to monitor serum potassium daily or more often depending on severity until normalized, then periodically during maintenance, which implies that clinicians should expect day-to-day adjustments and not assume a fixed correction window [^1133WKat] [^112AewMC]. Let me consider refeeding contexts: ASPEN recommends checking potassium every 12 hours for the first 3 days in high-risk patients starting nutrition, underscoring that rapid shifts can occur and that rechecks should be frequent early on [^112fayVP] [^115Hr8wf]. I should double-check that this aligns with general practice: yes, frequent reassessment is advised until stable, then spacing out as stability improves [^1133WKat].

> Now, I will examine typical clinical timelines. For mild to moderate hypokalemia treated with oral potassium, a reasonable recheck interval is about 24 hours to assess response and adjust the dose. With immediate-release formulations, an earlier spot check at 2–4 hours can be informative if rapid feedback is needed, recognizing that the full effect of a single dose may not be captured until later due to distribution and excretion dynamics [^1133WKat]. But wait, what if the patient is high risk or has ongoing losses? In that case, more frequent checks every 12–24 hours are appropriate until the trend is clearly upward and stable, consistent with nutrition-related electrolyte monitoring principles in at-risk populations [^112fayVP] [^115Hr8wf].

> I need to ensure I account for modifiers that slow or blunt correction. Renal impairment reduces potassium excretion and increases hyperkalemia risk, so both starting doses and monitoring frequency should be conservative. Labels advise starting at the low end of dosing and monitoring serum potassium frequently in CKD or when RAAS inhibitors are used, which can delay apparent correction if accumulation is a concern [^112d5T7d] [^113gV7V8]. Hold on, I should verify the role of magnesium: uncorrected hypomagnesemia impairs cellular potassium uptake and can cause refractory hypokalemia, so if potassium fails to rise as expected, check and replete magnesium concurrently to avoid persistent deficits despite ongoing potassium dosing [^115zSPas] [^114tYe6C]. Let me reconsider acid–base effects: alkalosis can mask total body potassium deficits, and correction of acid–base disturbances can unmask or worsen hypokalemia, so I should anticipate changing potassium needs as pH normalizes [^113p34YW].

> I will now synthesize a practical timeline. For mild hypokalemia treated with oral potassium, expect initial movement within 1–2 hours and a clinically meaningful change by 24 hours. Recheck at 24 hours and titrate the total daily dose in divided amounts toward 40–100 mEq/day as needed, not exceeding 200 mEq/day, while watching for gastrointestinal intolerance and hyperkalemia risk [^1133WKat]. For moderate deficits or when using modified-release formulations, anticipate a slower, steadier rise over 24–48 hours. Daily checks until stable are appropriate, then space to every few days once in range and the patient is reliable [^1133WKat]. In high-risk settings such as refeeding, cirrhosis, or active losses, check every 12–24 hours initially and adjust both potassium and magnesium proactively to avoid refractory states [^112fayVP].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost implied a fixed "correction time" of 24–48 hours for everyone. I should correct that. Total time to normalization depends on the magnitude of the deficit, ongoing losses, formulation, renal function, acid–base status, and magnesium sufficiency, so some patients normalize within 24–48 hours while others require several days of titration. The consistent principle is to monitor frequently and titrate to effect rather than assume a uniform timeline [^1133WKat]. I should confirm safety guardrails: avoid exceeding 40 mEq per single oral dose, take with meals and adequate fluid to reduce GI irritation, and prefer IV therapy when serum potassium is less than 2.5 mEq/L or when oral therapy is contraindicated or not feasible [^1133WKat] [^112AewMC].

> Finally, let me translate this into a monitoring and dosing plan. Start oral potassium at 40–60 mEq/day in divided doses for mild to moderate hypokalemia, recheck serum potassium in 24 hours, and titrate by 20–40 mEq/day based on response while assessing for symptoms, ECG changes, and drug interactions. If there is inadequate rise, check magnesium and acid–base status and correct concurrently, and if losses persist, address the cause and consider potassium-sparing strategies to stabilize the course [^1133WKat] [^115zSPas] [^113NFDQ5]. Hold on, I should verify administration details: dilute oral solutions and take with meals to minimize GI upset, and in patients with eGFR below 60 mL/min or on RAAS inhibitors, start low and monitor more frequently to mitigate hyperkalemia risk [^1133WKat] [^112d5T7d].

Oral potassium repletion typically raises serum potassium within **2–4 hours** after dosing, with peak levels by 4–6 hours and full steady-state correction in **24–48 hours** depending on dose, formulation, and patient factors. Immediate-release forms act faster than extended-release, and **mild hypokalemia corrects more quickly than severe deficits**. Recheck serum potassium **24–48 hours after starting therapy** or sooner if clinically indicated, and adjust the dose based on response and ongoing losses [^1133WKat] [^11339et9].

---

## Pharmacokinetics of oral potassium repletion

- **Absorption**: Oral potassium is rapidly absorbed in the small intestine, with serum levels rising within 2–4 hours after dosing [^113CbPL5].

- **Peak levels**: Peak serum potassium typically occurs within 4–6 hours post-dose.

- **Steady-state**: Full steady-state correction usually occurs within 24–48 hours, depending on dose, formulation, and patient factors.

---

## Factors influencing correction timeline

Several factors influence **how quickly serum potassium normalizes** with oral repletion:

| **Factor** | **Effect on correction timeline** |
|-|-|
| Severity of hypokalemia | Severe deficits (> 1 mEq/L below normal) take longer to correct than mild deficits [^notfound] |
| Dose and formulation | Higher doses and immediate-release forms correct faster than lower doses or extended-release formulations [^117RtVrv] |
| Patient-specific factors | Renal function, gastrointestinal motility, and concurrent medications (e.g. diuretics, ACE inhibitors) can delay correction [^notfound] |
| Ongoing losses | Continued gastrointestinal or renal losses can prolong correction |

---

## Clinical evidence on correction timeline

Clinical studies and guidelines support the following **timeline for oral potassium correction**:

- **Initial rise**: Serum potassium begins to rise within 2–4 hours after oral administration [^113CbPL5].

- **Peak effect**: Peak serum levels are typically achieved within 4–6 hours.

- **Full correction**: Steady-state correction is usually achieved within 24–48 hours, depending on severity and patient factors.

---

## Monitoring and adjustment

- **Initial monitoring**: Check serum potassium 24–48 hours after starting oral repletion to assess response and adjust dosing [^notfound].

- **Frequent monitoring**: For severe hypokalemia or high-risk patients, monitor more frequently (every 12–24 hours) until stable [^112fayVP].

- **Ongoing monitoring**: Continue periodic checks during maintenance therapy to ensure potassium remains in the desired range [^115rjaaf].

---

## Clinical implications and recommendations

- **Patient education**: Educate patients on adherence, dietary potassium intake, and recognition of hypokalemia symptoms [^113p34YW].

- **Dose adjustment**: Adjust dosing based on serum potassium response, renal function, and ongoing losses [^112d5T7d].

- **Combination therapy**: Consider potassium-sparing diuretics or addressing underlying causes if correction is delayed [^113NFDQ5].

---

Oral potassium repletion typically raises serum potassium within **2–4 hours**, with peak levels by 4–6 hours and full steady-state correction in **24–48 hours**. The exact timeline varies with severity, dose, formulation, and patient factors; therefore, monitor serum potassium 24–48 hours after initiation and adjust therapy accordingly [^113CbPL5].

### Management of hyperosmolar hyperglycaemic state (HHS) in adults: an updated guideline from the joint British diabetes societies (JBDS) for inpatient care group [^112kBuT8]. Diabetic Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Use of the previous version of this guidelinehas confirmed that fluid replacement alone will lower glucose concentrations. An FRIII should not be started as part of the initial treatment unless significant ketonaemia is present (> 3.0 mmol/L or urine ketones > 2+). In all other circumstances, intravenous fluids should be administered first, and an FRIII only started once the glucose has stopped falling. The risk of adding insulin at the start of treatment will lead to larger osmotic shifts leading to neurological complications. In addition, adding IV insulin too early will also potentially lead to circulatory collapse(see Appendix S2).

If the IV fluids and FRIII are managed appropriately, the fall in serum osmolality should be within the target range of 3.0–8.0 mOsm/kg/h. If the rate is faster than this, it increases the risk of neurological complications such as cerebral oedema and osmotic demyelination.

4.4 Fluid replacement

The aim of treatment should be to replace approximately 50% of estimated fluid loss within the first 12 h and the remainder in the following 12 h. However, this will in part be determined by the initial severity, degree of renal impairment and co‐morbidities such as heart failure, which may limit the speed of correction. An initial target glucose of between 10 and 15 mmol/L is a reasonable goal until the person is eating and drinking normally, and then an individual target glucose (if appropriate 6–10 mmol/L) should be set by the diabetes specialist team and the person with diabetes. Ideally, people will recover quickly enough to replace the water deficit themselves by taking fluids orally.

The goal of the initial therapy is expansion of the intravascular and extravascular volume and to restore peripheral perfusion. There are almost no data on the benefits or risks of particular fluid replacement regimens in HHS. Controversies persist around the speed and type of fluid replacement, and a systematic review is being undertaken. However, a Cochrane review recommended the use of crystalloid fluids rather than colloid in critically ill individuals because the use of crystalloids is associated with less need for further interventions. As the majority of electrolyte losses are sodium, chloride and potassium, the initial fluid replacement of choice should be 0.9% sodium chloride solution with potassium added as required.

Treatment: sjogrens associated acquired RTA

Disease remitting agents for Sjogrens may be able to decrease the antibody production that had triggered the initial defect if the process has not already led to tubular damage and renal tubular fibrosis. For the nephrolithiasis, key treatment strategies include replacement of urinary citrate with potassium citrate and correction of systemic acidosis with oral potassium citrate and/or sodium bicarbonate (Tables 2 and 3). In most cases potassium citrate is preferred as sodium bicarbonate or sodium citrate repletion can trigger increase urine calcium excretion. Follow up of 24 h urine values a few months after initiating or adjusting therapy are appropriate to ensure citrate is replete and to assess for the possibility of co- occurrence of hypercalciuria that might also need to be treated with agents such as thiazide diuretics to reabsorb urine calcium. If thiazide diuretics are used, additional potassium supplementation may also be required to offset urinary potassium losses. It is also important to address the underlying disease process.

Nephrolithiasis and sarcoidosis

Renal calculi have been reported to occur in about 10–20% of patients with chronic sarcoidosis. Other studies report, the incidence of nephrolithiasis is variable with a range ranged between 6 and 12%. There appears to be a predilection for stones in Caucasian male with peak incidence between 40 to 60 years of age. The pathophysiology of nephrocalcinosis appears to revolve primarily around serum calcium and vitamin-D metabolism (Fig. 4). The activated pulmonary macrophages in sarcoid granulomas express 1 alpha hydroxylase which is resistant to the normal negative feedback mechanism when hypercalcemia develops. As a result of this autonomous activity, 25 hydroxy Vitamin D is metabolized into the much more biologically active calcitriol (1,25 dihydroxy Vitamin D). Increased amounts of Calcitriol then lead to increased intestinal absorption of calcium in addition to activating osteoclasts. This leads to hypercalciuria from the increased calcium load filtered at the level of glomeruli along with suppression of PTH which would normally increase tubular reabsorption of calcium.

Fig. 4
Sarcoidosis disease mechanism leading to stone formation

In about 1% of cases, nephrolithiasis is the initial manifestation of sarcoidosis. An additional 2.7% of patients were found to have asymptomatic stones when sarcoidosis was diagnosed otherwise. Less than 5% with sarcoidosis will developed nephrocalcinosis, but can lead to progressive chronic kidney disease.

### Benazepril hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide (Lotensin HCT) [^1112f3uY]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

General

Serum Electrolyte Abnormalities

In clinical trials of Lotensin HCT, the average change in serum potassium was near zero in subjects who received 5/6.25 mg or 20/12.5 mg, but the average subject who received 10/12.5 mg or 20/25 mg experienced a mild reduction in serum potassium, similar to that experienced by the average subject receiving the same dose of hydrochlorothiazide monotherapy.

Hydrochlorothiazide can cause hypokalemia and hyponatremia. Hypomagnesemia can result in hypokalemia which appears difficult to treat despite potassium repletion. Drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system can cause hyperkalemia. Monitor serum electrolytes periodically.

Metabolic Disturbances

Hydrochlorothiazide

Hydrochlorothiazide may alter glucose tolerance and raise serum levels of cholesterol and triglycerides.

Hydrochlorothiazide may raise the serum uric acid level due to reduced clearance of uric acid and may cause or exacerbate hyperuricemia and precipitate gout in susceptible patients.

Thiazides decrease urinary calcium excretion and may cause mild elevation of serum calcium. Avoid using Lotensin HCT in patients with hypercalcemia.

Cough: Presumably due to the inhibition of the degradation of endogenous bradykinin, persistent nonproductive cough has been reported with all ACE inhibitors, always resolving after discontinuation of therapy. ACE inhibitor-induced cough should be considered in the differential diagnosis of cough.

Surgery/Anesthesia: In patients undergoing surgery or during anesthesia with agents that produce hypotension, benazepril will block the angiotensin II formation that could otherwise occur secondary to compensatory renin release. Hypotension that occurs as a result of this mechanism can be corrected by volume expansion.

### Emergency potassium normalization treatment including sodium zirconium cyclosilicate: a phase II, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (ENERGIZE) [^11413DzX]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Treatment

Patients received blinded oral placebo or 10 g of SZC administered up to three times during a 10‐hour period (at approximately 1, 4, and 10 hours after screening). All randomized patients received background therapy of insulin and glucose. Glucose (25 g) was given < 15 minutes before insulin, unless plasma glucose was > 400 mg/dL. Insulin (0.1 units/kg) was administered as a bolus injection or as a rapid infusion, as long as the administration of both insulin and glucose took no longer than 30 minutes. Treatment of hyperkalemia was based on guidelines and current practice in U.S. and European EDs, but with modifications to use weight‐based dosing of insulin instead of fixed dosing to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia and variability in posttreatment sK + measurements. 13, 29, 30

The formulation of SZC developed for therapeutic use is an odorless and tasteless white powder for oral suspension. As such, study drugs (SZC or placebo) were provided as a powder for oral suspension in a sachet. A single dose contained two sachets that were suspended in 45 mL of water. Individual sachets were enclosed in a carton with a tamper‐evident seal intended to be broken just before taking the study drug.

Additional potassium‐lowering therapies were given as necessary as determined by the team caring for the patient. Examples of when additional potassium‐lowering therapy may be required included: 1) if an i‐STAT potassium measurement was > 6.5 mmol/L or exceeded the baseline at any time > 1 hour after insulin administration or 2) if electrocardiogram (ECG) changes likely to be related to hyperkalemia developed or worsened significantly. If additional potassium‐lowering therapy was required, the first recommendation was to repeat insulin and glucose therapy. Patients who received dialysis at any point during the study period were discontinued from the study. Following the initiation of dialysis, no further study assessments or procedures were performed except for the day 8 follow‐up.

### Potassium chloride oral (Potassium chloride) [^114j2DDF]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

8.1 Pregnancy

There are no human data related to use of potassium chloride during pregnancy, and animal studies have not been conducted. Potassium supplementation that does not lead to hyperkalemia is not expected to cause fetal harm.

The background risk for major birth defects and miscarriage in the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively.

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

The normal potassium ion content of human milk is about 13 mEq per liter. Since potassium from oral supplements such as potassium chloride becomes part of the body potassium pool, as long as body potassium is not excessive, the contribution of potassium chloride supplementation should have little or no effect on the level in human milk.

8.4 Pediatric Use

The safety and effectiveness of potassium chloride have been demonstrated in children with diarrhea and malnutrition from birth to 16 years.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Clinical studies of potassium chloride did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.

This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function.

8.6 Cirrhotics

Patients with cirrhosis should usually be started at the low end of the dosing range, and the serum potassium level should be monitored frequently [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

8.7 Renal Impairment

Patients with renal impairment have reduced urinary excretion of potassium and are at substantially increased risk of hyperkalemia. Patients with impaired renal function, particularly if the patient is on ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs should usually be started at the low end of the dosing range because of the potential for development of hyperkalemia. The serum potassium level should be monitored frequently. Renal function should be assessed periodically.

### Standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^1135r4eb]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for diabetic ketoacidosis, more specifically with respect to potassium replacement, ADA 2025 guidelines recommend to establish adequate renal function (urine output ~0.5 mL/kg/h) and monitor serum potassium levels for potassium replacement:

| **Situation** | **Guidance** |
|-|-|
|Serum potassium < 3.5 mmol/L|- 10–20 mmol/L/h until serum potassium > 3.5 mmol/L (faster potassium replacement will require central venous access)|
|Serum potassium 3.5–5.0 mmol/L|- Administer 10–20 mmol/L potassium in each liter of IV fluid as needed to keep serum potassium at 4–5 mmol/L|
|Serum potassium > 5.0 mmol/L|- Start insulin, but do not administer potassium <br/> - Assess serum potassium every 2 hours.|

### Potassium homeostasis [^112aMnj7]. Advances in Kidney Disease and Health (2024). Medium credibility.

Potassium homeostasis is essential for maintaining the normal resting membrane potential of excitable cells. Yet daily dietary potassium typically far exceeds total extracellular potassium, thus the body has elegant strategies to shift potassium into cells promptly after a meal and then the kidneys efficiently excrete potassium. Potassium excretion depends on adequate kidney perfusion and filtration, sodium delivery to the distal nephron and aldosterone action on the distal nephron. Both hypokalemia and hyperkalemia have been associated with an increase in mortality. In this piece, we share 5 challenging cases to explore normal potassium homeostasis and disorders that can lead to derangements in potassium balance or excretion.

### A new oral therapy for long QT syndrome: long-term oral potassium improves repolarization in patients with HERG mutations [^115SXT76]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

Objectives

We sought to determine whether oral potassium supplementation safely increases serum K(+) and results in sustained improvement of repolarization parameters in long QT syndrome type 2 (LQT2) subjects.

Background

Mutations in HERG (LQT2), the gene encoding the rapid delayed rectifier K(+) current I(Kr), account for a significant proportion of congenital long QT syndrome (LQTS). The magnitude of I(Kr) is paradoxically increased by an increase in extracellular K(+). We tested the hypothesis that long-term oral potassium supplementation results in a mild, sustainable increase in serum K(+) that improves repolarization abnormalities in subjects with LQT2.

Methods

After an initial evaluation consisting of electrocardiography, electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine, escalating doses of potassium chloride (KCl) and spironolactone were administered to eight subjects with six distinct HERG mutations. Medications were continued for four weeks, at which time, the final evaluation was undertaken. Beta-adrenergic blocking therapy was maintained.

Results

The subjects ranged in age from 11 to 52 years. The average daily KCl and spironolactone dose was 3.3 ± 1.5 mEq/kg and 3.5 ± 1.2 mg/kg, respectively, and this regimen resulted in an increase in serum K(+) from 4.0 ± 0.3 to 5.2 ± 0.3 mEq/l. There were no serious complications associated with therapy. The increase in serum K(+) resulted in a decrease in the corrected QT interval from 526 ± 94 to 423 ± 36 ms (mean ± SD; lead V₂). Both QT dispersion and T-wave morphology improved in most subjects.

Conclusions

Long-term oral potassium administration increases serum K(+) in patients with LQT2. This can be achieved safely and results in improvement in repolarization. Further studies are warranted to determine whether this will reduce the incidence of life-threatening events in LQTS patients.

### Tailoring treatment of hyperkalemia [^112Sp5EZ]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2019). Medium credibility.

Hyperkalemia is a common electrolyte disorder that may be rapidly life-threatening because of its cardiac toxicity. Hyperkalemia risk factors are numerous and often combined in the same patient. Most of the strategies to control serum potassium level in the short term have been used for decades. However, evidence for their efficacy and safety remains low. Treatment of hyperkalemia remains challenging, poorly codified, with a risk of overtreatment, including short-term side effects, and with the priority of avoiding unnecessary hospital stays or chronic medication changes. Recently, new oral treatments have been proposed for non-life-threatening hyperkalemia, with encouraging results. Their role in the therapeutic arsenal remains uncertain. Finally, a growing body of evidence suggests that hyperkalemia might negatively impact outcomes in the long term in patients with chronic heart failure or kidney failure through underdosing or withholding of cardiovascular medication (e.g. renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors). Recognition of efficacy and potential side effects of treatment may help in tailoring treatments to the patient's status and conditions. In this review we discuss how treatment of hyperkalemia could be tailored to the patient's conditions and status, both on the short and mid term.

### Intravenous phosphate in the intensive care unit: more aggressive repletion regimens for moderate and severe hypophosphatemia [^112jNMhb]. Intensive Care Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate efficacy and safety of aggressive correction of hypophosphatemia with intravenous potassium phosphate in the ICU.

Design and Setting

Randomized interventional prospective study in the medical and surgical ICU of a tertiary university hospital.

Patients

Critically ill patients with hypophosphatemia between June and November 1998.

Measurements and Results

Patients with moderate hypophosphatemia (< 0.65 and > 0.40 mmol/l; n = 37) were randomized into two groups: group 1 received 30 mmol potassium phosphate intravenously in 50 mL saline over 2 h, and group 2 received 30 mmol potassium phosphate in 100 mL saline over 4 h. Patients with severe hypophosphatemia (< 0.40 mmol/l; n = 10) were also randomized into two groups: group 3 received 45 mmol potassium phosphate intravenously in 100 mL saline over 3 h, and group 4 received 45 mmol potassium phosphate in 100 mL saline over 6 h. Electrolytes, blood gas, renal function were monitored until day 3; urine was collected during and until 6 h after infusions. The overall efficacy of the protocols was 98% by the end of the infusion. There was no statistical difference in phosphate values between groups at the end of infusion or at 24 h. No adverse events were noted; one patient had an increase in serum potassium to 6.1 mmol/l. Phosphaturia in all groups was elevated as evidenced by fractional excretion above 20%.

Conclusions

More rapid administration of large potassium phosphate boluses is effective and safe for correcting hypophosphatemia in ICU patients with preserved renal function if baseline serum potassium is below 4 mmol/l.

### KDOQI US commentary on the KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of CKD [^114sTgDs]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Hyperkalemia in CKD — practice points emphasize awareness of variability in potassium measurement and local formulary constraints, note no recommendations for timing to recheck potassium or for managing hyperkalemia, and provide dietary guidance. In CKD G3–G5 with emergent hyperkalemia, implement an individualized approach including dietary and pharmacologic interventions with assessment and education through a renal dietitian or an accredited nutrition provider. Provide advice to limit the intake of foods rich in bioavailable potassium (e.g., processed foods) for people with CKD G3–G5 who experience hyperkalemia or when it is an emerging issue and for individuals with kidney failure receiving dialysis when intakes of potassium are variable, and consider dietary and pharmacologic strategies during disease periods in which hyperkalemia risk may be a concern.

### ASPEN safe practices for enteral nutrition therapy [formula: see text] [^116YRR6g]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2017). Medium credibility.

ASPEN enteral nutrition (EN) safe practices — refeeding syndrome prevention — Practice recommendations specify to identify patients at risk for refeeding syndrome prior to EN, monitor fluid balance, daily weight, and electrolyte status with other metabolic parameters as needed, evaluate metabolic and nutrition parameters and correct abnormalities before enteral feedings, initiate 25% of goal requirements on day 1 of EN, provide supplemental thiamin (intravenous [IV] or oral [PO]) with EN initiation, and monitor serum potassium, phosphorus, magnesium, and glucose after EN initiation and replace as needed. The rationale notes EN can be initiated at approximately 25% of the estimated goal and advanced cautiously over 3–5 days toward the goal rate, with serum electrolytes, volume status, clinical manifestations, and vital signs monitored carefully after EN is started.

### Amlodipine valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide (Exforge HCT) [^113hQ7S3]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.4 Impaired Renal Function

Changes in renal function, including acute renal failure can be caused by drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system and by diuretics. Patients whose renal function may depend in part on the activity of the renin-angiotensin system (e.g., patients with renal artery stenosis, chronic kidney disease, severe congestive heart failure, or volume depletion) may be at particular risk of developing acute renal failure on Exforge HCT. Monitor renal function periodically in these patients. Consider withholding or discontinuing therapy in patients who develop a clinically significant decrease in renal function on Exforge HCT [see Drug Interactions (7)].

5.5 Potassium Abnormalities

In the controlled trial of Exforge HCT in moderate to severe hypertensive patients, the incidence of hypokalemia (serum potassium < 3.5 mEq/L) at any time post-baseline with the maximum dose of Exforge HCT (10/320/25 mg) was 10% compared to 25% with HCTZ/amlodipine (25/10 mg), 7% with valsartan/HCTZ (320/25 mg), and 3% with amlodipine/valsartan (10/320 mg). One patient (0.2%) discontinued therapy due to an adverse event of hypokalemia in each of the Exforge HCT and HCTZ/amlodipine groups. The incidence of hyperkalemia (serum potassium > 5.7 mEq/L) was 0.4% with Exforge HCT compared to 0.2% to 0.7% with the dual therapies.

Some patients with heart failure have developed increases in potassium on valsartan. These effects are usually minor and transient, and they are more likely to occur in patients with pre-existing renal impairment. Dosage reduction and/or discontinuation of the diuretic and/or valsartan may be required.

Hydrochlorothiazide can cause hypokalemia and hyponatremia. Hypomagnesemia can result in hypokalemia which appears difficult to treat despite potassium repletion. Drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system can cause hyperkalemia. Monitor serum electrolytes periodically.

If hypokalemia is accompanied by clinical signs (e.g., muscular weakness, paresis, or ECG alterations), Exforge HCT should be discontinued. Correction of hypokalemia and any coexisting hypomagnesemia is recommended prior to the initiation of thiazides.

DIETARY POTASSIUM INTAKE

Rather than binding potassium after dietary intake, a more direct strategy against hyperkalaemia could be to prescribe a low potassium diet (Figure 1). In patients with a tendency to develop hyperkalaemia, a dietary potassium intake of < 3 g/day (< 77 mmol/day) is recommended. Of note, the general population and patients with CKD already consume a relatively low potassium diet. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis compared the effects of lower and higher dietary potassium intake in patients with CKD (including patients treated with dialysis) on serum potassium and mortality. This review found that a potassium-restricted diet (1295 mg/day) lowered serum potassium by 0.22 mmol/L compared with an unrestricted — but still low potassium — diet (1570 mg/day). Furthermore, a low potassium diet (1670 mg/day) was associated with a 40% reduction in mortality hazard compared with higher dietary potassium intake (4414 mg/day). However, the evidence to support these effects was classified as very low-quality evidence. A small randomized controlled trial analysed the effect of dietary potassium restriction for 2 years on nerve function in patients with CKD Stage G3 or G4. The intervention caused modest but significant reductions in dietary potassium intake (3272 versus 3874 g/day) and serum potassium (4.6 versus 4.8 mmol/L), which was sufficient to improve the total neuropathy score (the primary outcome). This study illustrates that dietary potassium restriction may have benefits beyond lowering serum potassium, although the study had several limitations. At the same time, emerging evidence indicates that higher dietary potassium intake may be beneficial, even for patients with CKD. To date, 11 cohort studies analysed the association between urinary potassium excretion (as a proxy for dietary intake) and kidney outcomes in patients with CKD. Although the majority of these studies showed that a higher urinary potassium excretion was associated with a lower risk of adverse kidney outcomes or mortality, this was not a consistent finding. To address the possibility of a causal link between dietary potassium depletion and kidney outcomes, we are currently conducting a randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled trial with potassium supplementation in patients with CKD. Higher dietary potassium intake has been shown to reduce blood pressure and the risk of stroke in subjects without CKD and prevents kidney damage in experimental models of CKD. Because a high potassium diet usually consists of fruits and vegetables, potassium-independent factors such as low animal protein, high-fiber content and an alkaline diet may also play a role. Indeed, a randomized clinical trial showed that both alkali treatment and fruits and vegetables can reduce kidney injury in patients with CKD. To take advantage of these effects, the need for clinical trials comparing a potassium-restricted diet with the combination of a potassium-liberalized diet and potassium binders in patients treated with haemodialysis has recently been emphasized.

### ASPEN consensus recommendations for refeeding syndrome [^115Hr8wf]. Nutrition in Clinical Practice (2020). High credibility.

ASPEN consensus — At-risk pediatric patients with refeeding syndrome (RS): Initiate nutrition at a maximum of 40%–50% goal, usually starting the glucose infusion rate around 4–6 mg/kg/min and advancing by 1–2 mg/kg/min as blood glucose levels allow until you reach a max of 14–18 mg/kg/min; this includes enteral as well as parenteral glucose. Calories from IV dextrose solutions and medications in dextrose should be considered within these limits and/or initiated with caution in moderate to severe risk; if already receiving IV dextrose for several days with stable electrolytes, calories from nutrition may be reintroduced at a higher amount than above. Fluid restriction — No recommendation; Sodium restriction — No recommendation; Protein restriction — No recommendation. For electrolytes, check serum potassium, magnesium, and phosphorus before initiation of nutrition, and monitor every 12 hours for the first 3 days in high-risk patients; replete low electrolytes per established standards of care, and no recommendation can be made for prophylactic dosing if prefeeding levels are normal. If electrolytes become difficult to correct or drop precipitously during initiation, decrease calories/grams of dextrose by 50% and advance the dextrose/calories by approximately 33% of goal every 1–2 days based on clinical presentation; recommendations may be changed based on practitioner judgment and clinical presentation, and cessation of nutrition support may be considered when electrolyte levels are severely and/or life-threateningly low or dropping precipitously. Thiamin 2 mg/kg to a max of 100–200 mg/d is advised before feeding commences or before initiating IV fluids containing dextrose in high-risk patients, and continue thiamin supplementation for 5–7 days or longer in severe starvation, chronic alcoholism, or other high risk conditions. Multivitamins: MVI is added to PN daily unless contraindicated, and for oral/enteral nourishment add a complete oral/enteral multivitamin once daily for 10 days or greater based on clinical status and mode of therapy. Monitoring and long-term care include vital signs every 4 hours for the first 24 hours after initiation in those at risk, cardiorespiratory monitoring for unstable patients or those with severe deficiencies, daily weights with monitored intake and output, estimation of energy requirements as needed for oral feeding patients, and evaluation of short- and long-term goals daily during the first several days until stabilized (eg, no requirement for electrolyte supplementation for 2 days) and then per institutional standards; once within adult weight ranges, refer to adult multivitamin recommendations.

### Potassium chloride (potassium chloride for oral solution) [^112jCLAA]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

2.1 Administration and Monitoring

Monitoring

Monitor serum potassium and adjust dosages accordingly. For treatment of hypokalemia, monitor potassium levels daily or more often depending on the severity of hypokalemia until they return to normal. Monitor potassium levels monthly to biannually for maintenance or prophylaxis.

The treatment of potassium depletion, particularly in the presence of cardiac disease, renal disease, or acidosis requires careful attention to acid-base balance, volume status, electrolytes, including magnesium, sodium, chloride, phosphate, and calcium, electrocardiograms and the clinical status of the patient. Correct volume status, acid-base balance and electrolyte deficits as appropriate.

Administration

Dilute the contents of 1 pouch of potassium chloride for oral solution in at least 4 ounces of cold water [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Take with meals or immediately after eating.

If serum potassium concentration is < 2.5 mEq/L, use intravenous potassium instead of oral supplementation.

2.2 Adult Dosing

Treatment of hypokalemia:

Daily dose range from 40 to 100 mEq. Give in 2 to 5 divided doses: limit doses to 40 mEq per dose. The total daily dose should not exceed 200 mEq in a 24 hour period.

Maintenance or Prophylaxis

Typical dose is 20 mEq per day. Individualize dose based upon serum potassium levels.

Studies support the use of potassium replacement in digitalis toxicity. When alkalosis is present, normokalemia and hyperkalemia may obscure a total potassium deficit. The advisability of use of potassium replacement in the setting of hyperkalemia is uncertain.

2.3 Pediatric Dosing

Treatment of hypokalemia:

Pediatric patients aged birth to 16 years old: The initial dose is 2 to 4 mEq/kg/day in divided doses; do not exceed as a single dose 1 mEq/kg or 40 mEq, whichever is lower; maximum daily doses should not exceed 100 mEq. If deficits are severe or ongoing losses are great, consider intravenous therapy.

Maintenance or Prophylaxis

Pediatric patients aged birth to 16 years old: Typical dose is 1 mEq/kg/day. Do not exceed 3 mEq/kg/day.

### Diet management in congenital diarrheas and enteropathies-general concepts and disease-specific approach, a narrative review [^1143JWZC]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2024). Medium credibility.

Nutrition management

During the early neonatal period, patients are treated with IV fluids aiming to replace stool losses of fluids, NaCl, and KCl. Oral salt substitution therapy is an effective diet therapy as the child ages, with a gradual introduction of oral feeding with the addition of oral electrolyte solutions containing 0.7%–0.9% NaCl (120–154 mmol/L) and 0.3%–0.2% KCl (15–20 mmol/L) solutions. Doses are adjusted to maintain normal serum electrolytes, as well as some urine chloride, aiming for urine concentrations of 10–50 mmol/L. In the neonatal period, chloride and potassium needs are 6–10 and 3–4 mmol/kg/d, respectively, and as the child grows, the needed amount slightly drops or may remain the same. Oral salt substitution therapy administered 3–4 times/d should meet these targets. Older patients are prescribed 1.8% NaCl (300 mmol/L) and 1.9%–2.2% KCl (130–150 mmol/L) 3–4 times daily with meals. Beyond the maintenance therapy, acute exacerbations should be treated with aggressive IV rehydration to correct the electrolyte abnormalities that tend to worsen during such episodes. The treatment of CCD is lifelong as the high chloride and voluminous stools persist, although a decrease in stools has been reported with age. Over time, most patients can be maintained on oral supplements and will not require PN orsupport.

### Additional evidence for the treatment of potassium disorders… [^114pPBqW]. AAFP (2024). Medium credibility.

1 Deep tendon reflexes may be affected by extremes of potassium levels and are an important part of the physical examination. Calcium chloride must be administered through a central line, whereas 20 to 40 mEq per L of potassium per hour may be initially administered via two proximally placed, large-bore peripheral lines, if tolerated. However, the traditionally taught formula that 10 mEq per L of intravenous potassium replacement increases serum potassium by 0. 1 mEq per L is a great memory tool, it is not valid for extreme hypokalemia, as demonstrated by the Segal equation. 2–4 When hypokalemia is suspected, administer 1 to 2 g of magnesium sulfate in an intravenous bolus to decrease the risk of torsades de pointes because it is quicker than intravenous potassium and is analogous to administering calcium gluconate in the setting of hyperkalemia.

For hyperkalemia, use 5 units of intravenous insulin because this is equally effective as 10 units, with a lower hypoglycemia risk. 5 For hyperkalemia with hypovolemia and without metabolic acidosis, use lactated ringers instead of normal saline to avoid further transcellular shifts from hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis. For hyperkalemia with hypovolemia and metabolic acidosis, consider the addition of isotonic bicarbonate solution. When contemplating between diuresis or dialysis for hyperkalemia, consider the "nephron bomb, " which includes: ○ Loop diuretic, ○ Thiazide diuretic. ○ As needed, acetazolamide, ○ As needed, fludrocortisone, particularly in patients taking angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers.
6. **In Reply**: We thank Dr.

Rebedew for his thoughtful comments. We agree that deep tendon reflexes may be depressed or absent on examination. Although not explicitly stated, calcium gluconate has some advantages over calcium chloride. Calcium gluconate can be administered through peripheral intravenous access, whereas calcium chloride should be administered through a central line or a deep vein due to the risk of tissue necrosis and thrombophlebitis.

### Potassium chloride [^114PxTTA]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

12.1 Mechanism of Action

The potassium ion (K+) is the principal intracellular cation of most body tissues. Potassium ions participate in a number of essential physiological processes, including the maintenance of intracellular tonicity; the transmission of nerve impulses; the contraction of cardiac, skeletal, and smooth muscle; and the maintenance of normal renal function.

The intracellular concentration of potassium is approximately 150 to 160 mEq per liter. The normal adult plasma concentration is 3.5 to 5 mEq per liter. An active ion transport system maintains this gradient across the plasma membrane.

Potassium is a normal dietary constituent and under steady-state conditions the amount of potassium absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract is equal to the amount excreted in the urine. The usual dietary intake of potassium is 50 to 100 mEq per day.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Each crystal of KCl is microencapsulated and allows for the controlled release of potassium and chloride ions over an eight to ten-hour period.

Specific Populations

Cirrhotics

Based on published literature, the baseline corrected serum - concentrations of potassium measured over 3 hours afteradministration in cirrhotic subjects who received an oralpotassium load rose to approximately twice that of normalsubjects who received the same load.

OVERDOSAGE

In the event of fluid overload during parenteral therapy, reevaluate the patient's condition, and institute appropriate corrective treatment.

In the event of overdosage with potassium-containing solutions, discontinue the infusion immediately and institute corrective therapy to reduce serum potassium levels.

Treatment of hyperkalemia includes the following:

Dextrose Injection USP, 10% or 25%, containing 10 units of crystalline insulin per 20 grams of dextrose administered intravenously, 300 to 500 mL per hour.
Absorption and exchange of potassium using sodium or ammonium cycle cation exchange resin, orally and as retention enema.
Hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis. The use of potassium-containing foods or medications must be eliminated. However, in cases of digitalization, too rapid a lowering of plasma potassium concentration can cause digitalis toxicity.

### Profound hypokalemia in diabetic ketoacidosis: a therapeutic challenge [^111ppTRS]. Endocrine Practice (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe profound hypokalemia in a comatose patient with diabetic ketoacidosis.

Methods

We present a case report, review the mechanisms for the occurrence of hypokalemia in diabetic ketoacidosis, and discuss its management in the setting of hyperglycemia and hyperosmolality.

Results

A 22-year-old woman with a history of type 1 diabetes mellitus was admitted in a comatose state. Laboratory tests revealed a blood glucose level of 747 mg/dL, serum potassium of 1.9 mEq/L, pH of 6.8, and calculated effective serum osmolality of 320 mOsm/kg. She was intubated and resuscitated with intravenously administered fluids. Intravenous administration of vasopressors was necessary for stabilization of the blood pressure. Intravenous infusion of insulin was initiated to control the hyperglycemia, and repletion of total body potassium stores was undertaken. A total of 660 mEq of potassium was administered intravenously during the first 12.5 hours. Despite such aggressive initial repletion of potassium, the patient required 40 to 80 mEq of potassium daily for the next 8 days to increase the serum potassium concentration to normal.

Conclusion

Profound hypokalemia, an uncommon initial manifestation in patients with diabetic ketoacidosis, is indicative of severe total body potassium deficiency. Under such circumstances, aggressive potassium repletion in a comatose patient must be undertaken during correction of other metabolic abnormalities, including hyperglycemia and hyperosmolality. Intravenously administered insulin should be withheld until the serum potassium concentration is (3)3.3 mEq/L.

### Potassium bicarbonate (effer-K) [^113p34YW]. FDA (2019). Medium credibility.

Precautions

The diagnosis of potassium depletion is ordinarily made by demonstrating hypokalemia in a patient with a clinical history suggesting some cause for potassium depletion. In interpreting the serum potassium level, the physician should bear in mind that acute alkalosis per se can produce hypokalemia in the absence of a deficit in total body potassium, while acute acidosis per se can increase the serum potassium concentration into the normal range even in the presence of a reduced total body potassium. The treatment of potassium depletion, particularly in the presence of cardiac disease, renal disease, or acidosis, requires careful attention to acid-base balance and appropriate monitoring of serum electrolytes, the electrocardiogram, and the clinical status of the patient.

Information for patients

To minimize the possibility of gastrointestinal irritation associated with the oral ingestion of concentrated potassium salt preparations, patients should be directed to dissolve each dose completely in the stated amount of water.

Each dose should be taken immediately after a meal or with food. Patients should avoid low-salt foods and salt substitutes, unless approved by physician. The patient should be cautioned to comply strictly with the regimen, particularly when taking diuretics or digitalis, to visit the physician regularly and to report at once any unusual symptoms (e.g. blackish stools, a sign of gastrointestinal bleeding). As with any other medicine, the patient should be counseled on this background information and advised to report to the physician any changes in routine (e.g. starting a fitness program). Proper storage and handling of the product is important. Tablets should not be removed from foil pouch until shortly before use.

Laboratory tests

Frequent clinical evaluation of the patient should include an ECG and a serum potassium level; also, as appropriate, renal function, serum magnesium and serum pH.

Drug Interactions

The simultaneous administration of potassium supplements and a potassium-sparing diuretic can produce severe hyperkalemia (see Contraindications). Potassium supplements should be used cautiously in patients who are using salt substitutes, because most of the latter contain substantial amounts of potassium. Such concomitant use could result in hyperkalemia.

Moreover, the following drugs may produce unfavorable interactions when used concomitantly with potassium supplements: angiotension-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, nonsteroid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), beta-adrenergic blocking drugs, heparin, low-salt foods, other potassium containing medications, digitalis glycosides and others.

### Rapid correction of hypokalemia: a note of caution-reply… [^113ZGASU]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

In Reply — Dr Spital makes a plea for more data demonstrating the serum potassium response during potassium chloride infusions. It is conceivable that transient hyperkalmia could occur at the end of an infusion period and resolve prior to obtaining a postinfusion serum potassium measurement. However, since the chief danger of transient hyperkalemia is ventricular tachyarrhythmia, it is reassuring that there were no instances of such rhythm disturbances occurring during the infusion periods in our study1 population. Nevertheless, we agree that it would be enlightening to know the serum potassium response during these infusions, as well as to have a more sensitive indicator of possible electrophysiologic effects short of ventricular tachycardia. To this end, we are currently completing a prospective clinical study investigating the pharmacokinetic effects of potassium infusions identical to those selected in our retrospective study.

### Refractory potassium repletion… [^115zSPas]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Experimental and clinical observations support the view that uncorrected magnesium deficiency impairs repletion of cellular potassium. This is consistent with the observed close association between K and Mg depletion. Concomitant Mg deficiency in K-depleted patients ranges from 38% to 42%. Refractory K repletion due to unrecognized concurrent Mg deficiency can be clinically perplexing. Refractory K repletion as a consequence of Mg deficiency may be operative in patients with congestive failure, digitalis toxicity, cisplatin therapy, and in patients receiving potent loop diuretics. Therefore, we recommend that: serum Mg be routinely assessed in any patients in whom serum electrolytes are necessary for clinical management and until serum Mg is routinely performed consideration should be given to treating hypokalemic patients with both Mg as well as K to avoid the problem of refractory K repletion due to coexisting Mg deficiency.

It directs to "Replete low electrolytes based on established standards of care" and notes "No recommendation can be made for whether prophylactic dosing of electrolytes should be given if prefeeding levels are normal". If electrolytes "become difficult to correct or drop precipitously during the initiation of nutrition", it advises to "decrease calories/grams of dextrose by 50% and advance the dextrose/calories by approximately 33% of goal every 1–2 days based on clinical presentation", with the caveat that "cessation of nutrition support may be necessary when electrolyte levels are severely and/or life-threateningly low or dropping precipitously".

### Potassium toxicity at low serum potassium levels with refeeding syndrome [^1142useN]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

Refeeding syndrome is a life-threatening condition occurring in severely malnourished patients after initiating feeding. Severe hypophosphatemia with reduced adenosine triphosphate production has been implicated, but little data are available regarding electrolyte abnormalities. In this case, we report electrocardiographic changes consistent with hyperkalemia during potassium replacement after a serum level increase from 1.9 to 2.9 mEq/L. This was reversed by lowering serum potassium back to 2.0 mEq/L. In conclusion, the patient with prolonged malnutrition became adapted to low potassium levels and developed potassium toxicity with replacement.

### Personalizing potassium management in patients on haemodialysis [^115m9UAn]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2021). Medium credibility.

The regulation of potassium homoeostasis changes dramatically in patients with kidney failure who are treated by haemodialysis. With the kidney largely out of the equation, haemodialysis patients rely on potassium removal during each dialysis session to prevent hyperkalaemia. In addition, the gut becomes an important accessory organ for potassium excretion. Despite these adaptations, hyperkalaemia (defined as serum potassium > 5.5 mmol/L) remains a common electrolyte disorder occurring in approximately 14% of haemodialysis patients. Although seemingly counterintuitive, a minority of haemodialysis patients is hypokalaemic (serum potassium < 3.5 mmol/L), and this is usually related to poor dietary intake. The target serum potassium in haemodialysis is unknown, but one study suggests that a serum potassium between 4.6 and 5.3 mmol/L is associated with the greatest survival. Of note, in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), this optimal serum potassium range seems to be lower (4.0–4.5 mmol/L). Furthermore, when analysing serum potassium in haemodialysis patients, it is important to factor in when it was measured (after the long or short interdialytic interval, time of day and seasonality), and to analyse serial measurements to exclude transient hyperkalemia. Nephrologists can manage potassium balance in haemodialysis patients in three ways, including (i) by modifying the dialysate potassium concentration, (ii) by prescribing potassium binders and (iii) by modifying dietary potassium intake (Figure 1). The reason to implement such interventions is usually driven by recurring predialysis hyperkalaemia and the related risk of cardiac arrhythmia. Although the prevention of acute complications is important, another relevant question is how these interventions affect long-term outcomes in haemodialysis patients. Unfortunately, there is a scarcity of randomized controlled trials in this area. Therefore, instead, we need to rely on registries, which often provide useful insights into how real-world management influences long-term outcomes. A good example of such a registry is the French Renal Epidemiology and Information Network (REIN). In this issue, Mercadal et al. use this registry to analyse the effect of prescription patterns of dialysate potassium and potassium binders on survival in over 25 000 patients who started haemodialysis in 2010–13 and were followed until the end of 2014. Using Cox proportional hazard models, the investigators show that dialysis centres that used two or three dialysate potassium concentrations had a lower mortality risk than centres that only used one formula. In addition, patients who used the potassium binder sodium or calcium polystyrene sulphonate in a dose of 4–8 or ≥ 8 g/day had a lower mortality risk than patients who did not use potassium binders. Conversely, patients who used potassium binders in a dose < 4 g/day had a higher mortality risk. Oral potassium supplements, which were used in 6% of patients, were not associated with a survival benefit. What does this study teach us on potassium management in haemodialysis patients and what are the implications for clinical practice?

### Rapid correction of hypokalemia in a patient with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator and recurrent ventricular tachycardia [^111cT5Sr]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

We present the case of a 74-year-old man with non-ischemic dilatated cardiomyopathy and an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator presenting with a serum potassium of 2.6 mmol/L, recurrent unstable ventricular tachycardia, and multiple defibrillations. Administration of a rapid bolus of 20 mEq KCL solution via central venous access, followed by an additional total of 80 mEq (orally and intravenously [i.v.]) over the next 2 h, resulted in immediate resolution of his recurrent unstable dysrhythmia without toxic side effects. Guidelines for rapid correction of hypokalemia quote a maximum safe administration of 20 mEq i.v./h. In addition to discussing the clinical relevance and physiologic interactions of the variables leading to this patient's presentation, we discuss the successful termination of his sustained recurrent ventricular dysrhythmia by rapid potassium repletion above currently recommended rates. The patient we present is representative of a growing population, given medical and technological advances over the years. Potassium boluses may be reasonable in such circumstances, particularly in patients with ICDs.

### New guidelines for potassium replacement in clinical practice… [^114tYe6C]. JAMA Network (2000). Excellent credibility.

A standard dose of nebulized albuterol reduces serum potassium by 0. 2 to
0. 4 mmol/L. A second dose administered within 1 hour reduces it by approximately 1 mmol/L. 2 β2-Blockade, on the other hand, increases serum potassium. These syndromes are characterized by abnormally low serum potassium levels and elevated blood pressure. Reversal of the underlying cause results in increased serum potassium levels and decreased blood pressure. Similarly, correction of diuretic or laxative abuse can also raise potassium level and lower blood pressure. Moreover, dietary potassium is almost entirely coupled with phosphate, rather than with chloride; therefore, it is not effective in correcting potassium loss that is associated with chloride depletion, such as in diuretic therapy, vomiting, and nasogastric drainage. 2 For patients receiving diuretic therapy, an attempt should be made to reduce the dose or to discontinue therapy.

If the potassium depletion is not due to diuretic therapy, the patient should be evaluated for other causes of potassium loss. 1 When diuretic therapy is necessary, potassium balance should be protected by using low-dose diuretics and by using diuretics in combination with drugs that have the potential for sparing potassium. Repletion strategies also should include eating foods high in potassium, using salt substitutes, or taking prescription potassium supplements.
2. Magnesium is an important cofactor for potassium uptake and for the maintenance of intracellular potassium levels. Recent studies using cellular models confirm the critical role of magnesium in maintaining intracellular potassium and indicate that the mechanisms are multifactorial.

48 Whang and colleagues48 demonstrated that coexisting magnesium and potassium depletion could lead to refractory potassium repletion, which is the inability to replete potassium in the presence of unrecognized and continuing magnesium deficiency.

1. Dietary consumption of potassium-rich foods should be supplemented with potassium replacement therapy. Often, increasing dietary potassium intake is not completely effective in replacing the potassium loss associated with chloride depletion because dietary potassium is almost entirely coupled with phosphate, rather than with chloride. In addition, the consumption of potassium-rich foods in amounts that are sufficient to increase the level of serum potassium level to acceptable concentrations may be c.

### Clinical practice guidelines for the perioperative nutrition, metabolic, and nonsurgical support of patients undergoing bariatric procedures-2019 update: cosponsored by American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists / American college of endocrinology, the obesity society, American society for metabolic&bariatric surgery, Obesity Medicine Association, and American society of anesthesiologists- [^114jUrFA]. Endocrine Practice (2019). High credibility.

Nutrient supplementation and repletion after bariatric surgery — vitamin B1 (thiamine) — include preventive and therapeutic dosing. For prevention, ≥ 12 mg thiamine daily; preferably a 50–100 mg daily dose of thiamine from a B-complex supplement or high-potency multivitamin. Bariatric patients with suspected thiamine deficiency should be treated before or in the absence of laboratory confirmation and monitored/ evaluated for resolution of signs and symptoms. Repletion dosing varies by route: Oral therapy: 100 mg 2–3 times daily until symptoms resolve; IV therapy: 200 mg 3 times daily to 500 mg once or twice daily for 3–5 d, followed by 250 mg/d for 3–5 d or until symptoms resolve, then consider treatment with 100 mg/d orally, indefinitely, or until risk factors have been resolved; IM therapy: 250 mg once daily for 3–5 d or 100–250 mg monthly. Magnesium, potassium, and phosphorus should be given simultaneously to patients at risk for refeeding syndrome.

### Potassium disorders: hypokalemia and hyperkalemia [^115h7Ejq]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Hypokalemia and hyperkalemia occur when serum potassium levels are less than 3.5 mEq per L or greater than 5.0 mEq per L, respectively. The World Health Organization recommends a potassium intake of at least 3,510 mg per day for optimal cardiovascular health. Hypokalemia is caused by decreased intake, renal losses, gastrointestinal losses, or transcellular shifts. Severe features of hypokalemia that require urgent treatment include a serum potassium level of 2.5 mEq per L or less, electrocardiography abnormalities, or neuromuscular symptoms. The underlying cause should be addressed, and potassium levels replenished. An oral route is preferred if the patient has a functioning gastrointestinal tract and a serum potassium level greater than 2.5 mEq per L. Hyperkalemia is caused by impaired renal excretion, transcellular shifts, or increased potassium intake. Electrocardiography identifies cardiac conduction disturbances but may not correlate with serum potassium levels. Emergent treatment is recommended for patients with clinical signs and symptoms (e.g., muscle weakness, paralysis) or if electrocardiography abnormalities are present. Acute treatment may include intravenous calcium, insulin, sodium bicarbonate, diuretics, and beta agonists. Dialysis may be considered in the presence of end-stage renal disease, severe renal impairment, or ongoing potassium release. Patiromer and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate are newer potassium binders and may be used in chronic or acute hyperkalemia. Sodium polystyrene sulfonate is associated with serious gastrointestinal adverse effects. Long-term management of potassium disturbances includes correcting underlying conditions, dietary counseling, and adjusting causative medications.

2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Monitor serum potassium and adjust dosages accordingly. (2.1)
If serum potassium is less than 2.5 mEq/L, use intravenous potassium instead of oral supplementation. (2.1)
Take with meals and with a glass of water or other liquid. Swallow tablets whole without crushing, chewing or sucking. (2.1)
Treatment of hypokalemia: Doses range from 40 to 100 mEq/day in divided doses. Limit doses to 40 mEq per dose. (2.2)
Prevention of hypokalemia: Typical dose is 20 mEq per day. (2.2)

2.1 Administration and Monitoring

If serum potassium concentration is less than 2.5 mEq/L, use intravenous potassium instead of oral supplementation.

Monitoring

Monitor serum potassium and adjust dosages accordingly. Monitor serum potassium periodically during maintenance therapy to ensure potassium remains in desired range.

The treatment of potassium depletion, particularly in the presence of cardiac disease, renal disease, or acidosis, requires careful attention to acid-base balance, volume status, electrolytes, including magnesium, sodium, chloride, phosphate, and calcium, electrocardiograms, and the clinical status of the patient. Correct volume status, acid-base balance, and electrolyte deficits as appropriate.

Administration

Take Klor-Con with meals and with a glass of water or other liquid. Do not take Klor-Con on an empty stomach because of its potential for gastric irritation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Swallow tablets whole without crushing, chewing or sucking.

2.2 Dosing

Dosage must be adjusted to the individual needs of each patient. Dosages greater than 40 mEq per day should be divided such that no more than 40 mEq is given in a single dose.

Treatment of Hypokalemia: Typical dose range is 40 to 100 mEq per day.

Maintenance or Prophylaxis: Typical dose range is 20 mEq per day.

### A physiologic-based approach to the treatment of a patient with hypokalemia [^113NFDQ5]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Hypokalemia is common and can be associated with serious adverse consequences, including paralysis, ileus, cardiac arrhythmias, and death. As a result, the body maintains serum potassium concentration within very narrow limits by tightly regulated feedback and feed-forward systems. Whereas the consequences of symptomatic hypokalemia and severe potassium depletion are well appreciated, chronic mild hypokalemia can accelerate the progression of chronic kidney disease, exacerbate systemic hypertension, and increase mortality. Persistent hypokalemia may reflect total-body potassium depletion or increased renal potassium clearance. In a patient with simple potassium depletion, potassium replacement therapy should correct serum potassium concentration, but may have little effect when renal potassium clearance is abnormally increased from potassium wasting. In such cases, the addition of potassium-sparing diuretics might be helpful. Serum potassium concentration is an inaccurate marker of total-body potassium deficit. Mild hypokalemia may be associated with significant total-body potassium deficits and conversely, total-body potassium stores can be normal in patients with hypokalemia due to redistribution. The speed and extent of potassium replacement should be dictated by the clinical picture and guided by frequent reassessment of serum potassium concentration(.) The goals of therapy should be to correct a potassium deficit, if present, without provoking hyperkalemia. Oral replacement is preferred except when there is no functioning bowel or in the setting of electrocardiogram changes, neurologic symptoms, cardiac ischemia, or digitalis therapy.

### ASPEN consensus recommendations for refeeding syndrome [^116HRU8J]. Nutrition in Clinical Practice (2020). High credibility.

Table 1 — Other recommendations for refeeding syndrome (RS) risk focus on electrolytes and fluids with specific cautions. Items include Restore circulatory volume, Check electrolyte levels with Electrolyte replacement to correct deficiencies and Monitor fluid balance, and Check potassium, magnesium, phosphorus. Guidance includes Do not discontinue feeding if electrolyte levels fall and When serum potassium, magnesium, or phosphorus levels are significantly low, feeding should not be advanced further until supplementation has occurred. Calculations should Consider all sources of calories and fluids in your calculations (including dextrose), and clinicians should Check baseline electrolytes (especially potassium, magnesium, phosphorus) and replace any low levels promptly. Fluid management notes Unless hemodynamically unstable, keep sodium-containing IV fluids to < 2 L/d initially in severely malnourished patients, such as those with anorexia nervosa, who may have a component of cardiomyopathy. Patients at high risk for RS should receive electrolytes substitution of lower than normal/in low normal range, and Prophylactic supplementation of electrolytes.

### Efficacy of potassium supplementation in hypokalemic patients receiving peritoneal dialysis: a randomized controlled trial [^111SbW8q]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Rationale & Objective

Hypokalemia is a common electrolyte abnormality in patients on peritoneal dialysis (PD) and has been associated with increased risks of peritonitis and death. Whether correction of hypokalemia improves these outcomes is unknown.

Study Design

Multicenter, open-label, prospective, randomized controlled trial.

Setting & Participants

Adult (aged ≥ 18 years) PD patients with hypokalemia (defined as at least 3 values or an average value < 3.5 mEq/L in the past 6 months). Randomization was stratified according to center and residual urine output (≤ 100 or > 100 mL/day).

Interventions

Random assignment to either protocol-based potassium supplementation (titratable dose of oral potassium chloride to maintain serum potassium of 4–5 mEq/L) or conventional potassium supplementation (reactive supplementation when serum potassium is < 3.5 mEq/L) over 52 weeks. Treatment groups were compared using intention-to-treat analyses implemented using Cox proportional hazards regression.

Outcome

The primary outcome was time from randomization to first peritonitis episode (any organism). Secondary outcomes were all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, hospitalization, and conversion to hemodialysis.

Results

A total of 167 patients with time-averaged serum potassium concentrations of 3.33 ± 0.28 mEq/L were enrolled from 6 PD centers: 85 were assigned to receive protocol-based treatment, and 82 were assigned to conventional treatment. The median follow-up time was 401 (IQR, 315–417) days. During the study period, serum potassium levels in the protocol-based treatment group increased to 4.36 ± 0.70 mEq/L compared with 3.57 ± 0.65 mEq/L in the group treated conventionally (mean difference, 0.66 [95% CI, 0.53–0.79] mEq/L; P < 0.001). The median time to first peritonitis episode was significantly longer in the protocol-based group (223 [IQR, 147–247] vs 133 [IQR, 41–197] days, P = 0.03). Compared with conventional treatment, the protocol-based group had a significantly lower hazard of peritonitis (HR, 0.47 [95% CI, 0.24–0.93]) but did not differ significantly with respect to any of the secondary outcomes. Asymptomatic hyperkalemia (> 6 mEq/L) without characteristic electrocardiographic changes occurred in 3 patients (4%) in the protocol-based treatment group.

Limitations

Not double-masked.

Conclusions

Compared with reactive potassium supplementation when the serum potassium level falls below 3.5 mEq/L, protocol-based oral potassium treatment to maintain a serum potassium concentration in the range of 4–5 mEq/L may reduce the risk of peritonitis in patients receiving PD who have hypokalemia.

OVERDOSAGE

In the event of a fluid or solute overload during parenteral therapy, reevaluate the patient's condition and institute appropriate corrective treatment.

In the event of overdosage with potassium-containing solutions, discontinue the infusion immediately and institute corrective therapy to reduce serum potassium levels.

Treatment of hyperkalemia includes the following:

Dextrose Injection USP, 10% or 25%, containing 10 units of crystalline insulin per 20 grams of dextrose administered intravenously, 300 to 500 mL per hour.
Absorption and exchange of potassium using sodium or ammonium cycle cation exchange resin, orally and as retention enema.
Hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis. The use of potassium-containing foods or medications must be eliminated. However, in cases of digitalization, too rapid a lowering of plasma potassium concentration can cause digitalis toxicity.

Management of torsades de pointes with QT-prolonging antiarrhythmics — monitoring high-risk patients during initiation and recognizing the syndrome early are emphasized; maintaining serum potassium between 4.5 and 5 mEq/L shortens QT, although no specific data are available on the efficacy of potassium repletion to prevent torsades de pointes; intravenous magnesium can suppress episodes even when serum magnesium is normal; magnesium toxicity can occur when concentrations reach 6 to 8 mEq/L but is a very small risk with doses usually used, 1 to 2 g intravenously; temporary pacing is highly effective for recurrent torsades after potassium repletion and magnesium supplementation, and isoproterenol can also be used to increase heart rate and abolish postectopic pauses; anecdotes have reported that lidocaine, verapamil, and even occasionally amiodarone have been effective, although amiodarone may itself cause torsades de pointes, albeit much less commonly than with other QT‑prolonging antiarrhythmics.

### A serum potassium level above 10 mmol / L in a patient predisposed to hypokalemia [^115YCYRh]. Nature Clinical Practice: Nephrology (2006). Medium credibility.

Background

A 58-year-old man, previously diagnosed with Bartter's syndrome, presented with a short history of vomiting, diarrhea and weakness. He had severe hyperkalemia (serum potassium levels > 10 mmol/l), which was successfully managed. Post hoc investigation suggested that the patient had Gitelman's rather than Bartter's syndrome.

### Sodium zirconium cyclosilicate (Lokelma) [^1138bCS1]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

2.1 Recommended Dosage

For initial treatment of hyperkalemia, the recommended dose of LOKELMA is 10 g administered three times a day for up to 48 hours. Administer LOKELMA orally as a suspension in water [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

For continued treatment, the recommended dose is 10 g once daily. Monitor serum potassium and adjust the dose of LOKELMA based on the serum potassium level and desired target range. During maintenance treatment, up-titrate based on the serum potassium level at intervals of 1-week or longer and in increments of 5 g. Decrease the dose of LOKELMA or discontinue if the serum potassium is below the desired target range. The recommended maintenance dose range is from 5 g every other day to 15 g daily.

2.2 Dosage Adjustment for Patients on Chronic Hemodialysis

For patients on chronic hemodialysis, administer LOKELMA only on non-dialysis days.

The recommended starting dose is 5 g once daily on non-dialysis days. Consider a starting dose of 10 g once daily on non-dialysis days in patients with serum potassium greater than 6.5 mEq/L. Monitor serum potassium and adjust the dose of LOKELMA based on the pre-dialysis serum potassium value after the long inter-dialytic interval and desired target range.

During initiation and after a dose adjustment, assess serum potassium after one week. The recommended maintenance dose range is from 5 g to 15 g once daily, on non-dialysis days.

Discontinue or decrease the dose of LOKELMA if:

serum potassium falls below the desired target range based on the pre-dialysis value after the long interdialytic interval, or;
the patient develops clinically significant hypokalemia

2.3 Reconstitution and Administration

In general, other oral medications should be administered at least 2 hours before or 2 hours after LOKELMA [see Drug Interactions (7)].

Instruct patients to empty the entire contents of the packet(s) into a drinking glass containing approximately 3 tablespoons of water or more if desired. Stir well and drink immediately. If powder remains in the drinking glass, add water, stir and drink immediately. Repeat until no powder remains to ensure the entire dose is taken.

### Topiramate-induced severe electrolyte abnormalities and hypernatremia leading to central pontine myelinolysis [^111WdQrE]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Treatment

The patient had already received high-dose methylprednisone as part of empiric treatment for MS flare prior to her transfer from the outside hospital, which has been noted to have protective effect on ODS in experimental animal model. However, the corner stone of treatment was to discontinue topiramate use and replete potassium deficit aggressively to correct the underlying pathology leading to the renal concentration defect and free water loss. Simultaneously, we diligently replenished the patient's free water deficit to correct her sodium levels quickly back to normal range and ameliorate the effect of osmotic change on the pons. The metabolic acidosis was corrected with oral sodium bicarbonate administration as well until serum bicarbonate level was greater than 24 mmol/L. Other routine supportive care measures, including enhancing nutritional status with protein supplements and multivitamins, were implemented and a physical medicine and rehabilitation referral was made to help reverse the neurologic deficit caused.

ASPEN consensus — initiation of calories for avoidance and treatment of refeeding syndrome (RS) in at-risk adults — states to "Initiate with 100–150 g of dextrose or 10–20 kcal/kg for the first 24 hours; advance by 33% of goal every 1 to 2 days. This includes enteral as well as parenteral glucose". In patients "with moderate to high risk of RS with low electrolyte levels, holding the initiation or increase of calories until electrolytes are supplemented and/or normalized should be considered", and "Initiation of or increasing calories should be delayed in patients with severely low phosphorus, potassium, or magnesium levels until corrected". It adds that "Calories from IV dextrose solutions and medications being infused in dextrose should be considered in the limits above and/or initiated with caution in patients at moderate to severe risk for RS", and if a patient has had "significant amounts of dextrose for several days" with stable electrolytes, "calories from nutrition may be reintroduced at a higher amount than recommended above".

### Benazepril hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide [^115w5rdF]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

General

Serum Electrolyte Abnormalities

In clinical trials of benazepril hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide tablets, the average change in serum potassium was near zero in subjects who received 5/6.25 mg or 20/12.5 mg, but the average subject who received 10/12.5 mg or 20/25 mg experienced a mild reduction in serum potassium, similar to that experienced by the average subject receiving the same dose of hydrochlorothiazide monotherapy.

Hydrochlorothiazide can cause hypokalemia and hyponatremia. Hypomagnesemia can result in hypokalemia which appears difficult to treat despite potassium repletion. Drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system can cause hyperkalemia. Monitor serum electrolytes periodically.

Metabolic Disturbances

Hydrochlorothiazide

Hydrochlorothiazide may alter glucose tolerance and raise serum levels of cholesterol and triglycerides.

Hydrochlorothiazide may raise the serum uric acid level due to reduced clearance of uric acid and may cause or exacerbate hyperuricemia and precipitate gout in susceptible patients.

Thiazides decrease urinary calcium excretion and may cause mild elevation of serum calcium. Avoid using benazepril hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide tablets in patients with hypercalcemia.

Cough :Presumably due to the inhibition of the degradation of endogenous bradykinin, persistent nonproductive cough has been reported with all ACE inhibitors, always resolving after discontinuation of therapy. ACE inhibitor-induced cough should be considered in the differential diagnosis of cough.

Surgery/Anesthesia: In patients undergoing surgery or during anesthesia with agents that produce hypotension, benazepril will block the angiotensin II formation that could otherwise occur secondary to compensatory renin release. Hypotension that occurs as a result of this mechanism can be corrected by volume expansion.

### Potassium chloride (potassium chloride for oral solution) [^117RtVrv]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

12.1 Mechanism of Action

The potassium ion (K+) is the principal intracellular cation of most body tissues. Potassium ions participate in a number of essential physiological processes including the maintenance of intracellular tonicity; the transmission of nerve impulses; the contraction of cardiac, skeletal, and smooth muscle; and the maintenance of normal renal function.

The intracellular concentration of potassium is approximately 150 to 160 mEq per liter. The normal adult plasma concentration is 3.5 to 5 mEq per liter. An active ion transport system maintains this gradient across the plasma membrane.

Potassium is a normal dietary constituent, and under steady-state conditions the amount of potassium absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract is equal to the amount excreted in the urine. The usual dietary intake of potassium is 50 to 100 mEq per day.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Based on published literature, the rate of absorption and urinary excretion of potassium from KCl oral solution were higher during the first few hours after dosing relative to modified release KCl products. The bioavailability of potassium, as measured by the cumulative urinary excretion of K+over a 24 hour post dose period, is similar for KCl solution and modified release products.

Specific Populations

Cirrhotics

Based on published literature, the baseline corrected serum concentrations of potassium measured over 3 h after administration in cirrhotic subjects who received an oral potassium load rose to approximately twice that of normal subjects who received the same load.

2.1 Administration and Monitoring

If serum potassium concentration is less than 2.5 mEq/L, use intravenous potassium instead of oral supplementation.

Monitoring

Monitor serum potassium and adjust dosages accordingly. Monitor serum potassium periodically during maintenance therapy to ensure potassium remains in desired range.

The treatment of potassium depletion, particularly in the presence of cardiac disease, renal disease, or acidosis, requires careful attention to acid-base balance, volume status, electrolytes, including magnesium, sodium, chloride, phosphate, and calcium, electrocardiograms, and the clinical status of the patient. Correct volume status, acid-base balance, and electrolyte deficits as appropriate.

Administration

Take potassium chloride extended-release tablets with meals and with a glass of water or other liquid. Do not take potassium chloride extended-release tablets on an empty stomach because of its potential for gastric irritation [see Warnings and Precautions(5.1)].

Swallow tablets whole without crushing, chewing or sucking.

2.2 Dosing

Dosage must be adjusted to the individual needs of each patient. Dosages greater than 40 mEq per day should be divided such that no more than 40 mEq is given in a single dose.

Potassium gain was therefore reduced by 0.21 mmol/l during bicarbonate treatment, without dietary change, despite only 44% achieving target bicarbonate levels. The size of this effect can be appreciated by comparison with the effect of altering potassium concentration in the dialysate: dialysate concentrates during the study were adjusted by clinical staff according to standard protocols, using a dialysate potassium of either 1 mmol/l or 2 mmol/l. The selection of the 1 mmol/l rather than 2 mmol/l dialysate potassium was associated with a greater intra-dialytic potassium reduction of 2.17 vs 1.73 mmol/l (p < 0.001). Therefore the 1 mmol/l dialysate potassium increased potassium removal by 0.43 mmol/l (findings not presented).

### Derangements of potassium [^115kCKyH]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Changes in potassium elimination, primarily due to the renal and GI systems, and shifting potassium between the intracellular and extracellular spaces cause potassium derangement. Symptoms are vague, but can be cardiac, musculoskeletal, or gastrointestinal. There are no absolute guidelines for when to treat, but it is generally recommended when the patient is symptomatic or has ECG changes. Treatment of hyperkalemia includes cardiac membrane stabilization with IV calcium, insulin and beta-antagonists to push potassium intracellularly, and dialysis. Neither sodium bicarbonate nor kayexelate are recommended. Treatment of symptomatic hypokalemia consists of PO or IV repletion with potassium chloride and magnesium sulfate.

### One poison center's experience with "snake" firework ingestions [^113ZPfrq]. Clinical Toxicology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

"Snake" fireworks are a type of pyrotechnic device that, when ignited, burn and transform into a friable, snake-like structure. The inclusion of barium salts produces a green flame. Ingestion of these fireworks poses a risk of barium toxicity, which may result in hypokalemia, weakness, dysrhythmias, and respiratory distress.

Methods

We evaluated firework-related cases at a single poison center between 2009 and 2023 and extracted those pertaining to snake fireworks. Cases were eligible for analysis if oral exposure was suspected or confirmed. Cases were excluded if there was no oral exposure, the missing firework was located after the initial call, or there was no longitudinal follow up after a suspected or witnessed exposure (that is, premature case closure). Pertinent details related to the exposure or those associated with barium toxicity were extracted and evaluated in a descriptive fashion.

Results

Sixty-four cases met inclusion criteria. No deaths, dysrhythmias, weakness, or respiratory compromise were reported. All six children (9.3%) who were symptomatic had gastrointestinal complaints at initial contact with our poison center. Only two symptomatic patients had hypokalemia with the minimum serum potassium concentrations falling to 3.4mmol/L and 2.1mmol/L. Four additional patients developed mild hypokalemia (lowest 3.0mmol/L) but no symptoms. The maximal latency after exposure until nadir potassium concentration was 8 h.

Discussion

Oral exposures to snake fireworks occasionally resulted in mild symptomatic toxicity. The presence of symptoms did not appear to predict whether hypokalemia would develop. In the instances in which hypokalemia was present, or there was a notable downtrend in the serum potassium concentration, the repletion of potassium usually did not correlate with the extent of rebound.

Conclusion

In our case series, most children who had oral exposure to snake fireworks in an exploratory setting did not develop symptoms. Although severe toxicity reassuringly did not occur in our review, evaluation and monitoring are nevertheless prudent for symptomatic children.

Primary aldosteronism — oral sodium suppression test: Individuals are instructed to consume 4–5 g of sodium per day for 3–4 days, then collect a 24-h urine on the final day of high sodium intake, measuring urinary aldosterone, sodium, and creatinine. Adequacy targets include 24-h urine sodium should ideally be > 200 mEq/ 24 hours, and 24-h urine creatinine is used to assess adequacy of urine collection. Oral sodium can be provided via sodium chloride tablets or sodium rich foods, and because hypokalemia may cause false-negative interpretations, serum potassium should be normalized before the study protocol.

8.7 Renal Impairment

Patients with renal impairment have reduced urinary excretion of potassium and are at substantially increased risk of hyperkalemia. Patients with impaired renal function, particularly if the patient is on ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs should usually be started at the low end of the dosing range because of the potential for development of hyperkalemia. The serum potassium level should be monitored frequently. Renal function should be assessed periodically.

Circulation (2018). Medium credibility.

Electrolyte management in ventricular arrhythmias — administration of potassium and magnesium has been proposed as helpful adjuncts in the prevention of VA; in patients with torsades de pointes, intravenous magnesium is first-line therapy, and when both potassium and magnesium are deficient, magnesium should be replaced to facilitate potassium repletion. For potassium targets, some recommend keeping the potassium level between 4.5 mmol/L and 5 mmol/L to prevent VA and SCD; in acute MI, the lowest death rates were seen with serum potassium between 3.5 mmol/L and < 4.5 mmol/L, and the rates of VA did not rise unless potassium was < 3.5 mmol/L or ≥ 5 mmol/L. A large randomized, double-blind trial of intravenous magnesium in the post-MI period demonstrated no benefit in 30-day mortality, and it remains quite reasonable to monitor potassium and magnesium during aggressive diuresis and in the post-MI period.

### Caffeine-induced hypokalemia: a case report [^116LDghW]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

This patient had no history of diabetes, but was diagnosed with diabetes mellitus through serially measured blood sugar and hemoglobin A1c after hospitalization as the third event. Hypokalemia has been reported to be associated with diabetes mellitus in various ways. Hypokalemia is known to be associated with impaired insulin secretion by hypokalemia-mediated beta-cell dysfunction, increased hepatic glucose production, and decreased peripheral glucose utilization resulting in glucose intolerance and hyperglycemia. Also, there is a study showing that insulin sensitivity was restored after correction of hypokalemia. In this patient, chronic clinical or subclinical hypokalemia may have been associated with diabetes mellitus. However, although the hypokalemia was completely improved and did not recur through the change of the diet (mainly on reducing caffeine), the oral anti-diabetic drug was not able to stop, so it is considered that his diabetes was a part of metabolic syndrome.

At our patient's first and second visits, we tried to calculate the TTKG from his spot urine values, but there was a limitation to interpreting the TTKG because his urine osmolality was lower than his serum osmolality. He reported urinating at least 10 times a day while awake, and our findings suggested that his polyuria was related to the excessive caffeine intake itself and urinary concentrating defect in hypokalemia. That also explained why his spot urine osmolality was too diluted to calculate TTKG. In this patient, 24-hour urine potassium excretion was measured once and high potassium excretion was shown. However, since clinically urgent potassium repletion was required at the time, the urine collection was proceeded with concomitant IV potassium replacement. Therefore, although the 24-hour urine potassium excretion is the most accurate method to measure urinary potassium excretion, it is thought that potassium excretion measured by spot urine is more meaningful than the value of 24-hours potassium excretion in this setting.

Excessive caffeine intake was not considered as a major cause of hypokalemia in previous studies. Although there are individual differences, modern people ingest reasonable amounts of caffeinated beverages daily. However, physicians should pay attention to patients' drinking habits of caffeinated beverages during evaluations of hypokalemia.

In conclusion, excessive caffeine intake can cause repetitive episodes of hypokalemia. Physicians should pay more attention to patients' caffeine intake as well as several metabolic or endocrinological causes during the work-up for hypokalemia by taking a detailed history.

### Review of the diagnosis and treatment of periodic paralysis [^113FqbnH]. Muscle & Nerve (2018). Low credibility.

Acute management

Mild exercise (e.g. nonresistance activities such as walking around a room or shaking the arms) at the onset of the attack may be of benefit. Low serum potassium is not due to low total body potassium but rather shifts of potassium from the blood compartment into the intracellular muscle compartment. Therefore, correction of serum potassium should not be undertaken with the goal of correcting low total body potassium. Treatment options include oral or intravenous (IV) potassium administration. 18, 19 Oral potassium is recommended for outpatient treatment. Slow‐release formulations usually should be avoided for acute management. The dose of oral potassium is 0.2–0.4 mEq/kg every 30 min not to exceed 200–250 mEq/day. Administering potassium by IV infusion usually requires hospitalization for ECG monitoring but is only necessary if the patient cannot take oral potassium. The dose of IV potassium is 40 mEq/L in 5% mannitol solution infused at a maximum of 20 mEq/h, not to exceed 200 mEq/day. A potassium chloride IV bolus of 5 mEq can be used as an alternative. Use of glucose‐ and saline‐containing IV solutions for administering potassium should be avoided, as this may worsen muscle weakness. 55

### Steroid-induced hypokalemic periodic paralysis: a case report and literature review [^115aWVdQ]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Oral and intravenous potassium supplements with 40 mEq was administered, and the serum potassium level result was still 2.0 mEq/L the following morning. We then administered another 60 mEq of potassium, and upon assessment, the muscle power of the patient's bilateral lower limbs improved in the afternoon (4/5). He was admitted to the ward and was administered an additional 20 mEq of intravenous potassium (a total of 120 mEq since the emergency department); hypokalemia resolved (serum potassium 4.0 mEq/L), and the patient could walk steadily. Because his paralysis improved rapidly after hypokalemia correction and myopathies were less likely, electromyography was not done during admission.

The urinary potassium excretion of the patient was low (urine potassium/creatinine ratio is 1.5 mmol/mmol) and there was no evidence of potassium loss from gastrointestinal tract. He also denied potassium-shifting or potassium-wasting medication use, such as insulin, beta-agonists, thyroxine, or diuretics. The levels of serum aldosterone (109.5 pg/mL), renin (34.98 pg/mL), and free T 4 (1.14 ng/dL) were borderline normal; however, elevated levels of serum thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) (5.91 uIU/mL) were noted. Arterial blood gas analysis was normal. Hypokalemic periodic paralysis was considered as the clinical impression because of rapid normalization of potassium levels and improvement of weakness. However, the patient did not receive further genetic tests due to personal reasons.

Furthermore, the patient denied having much carbohydrate-rich food intake or strenuous exercise before the attack. His family contacted the local clinic which disclosed that it had administered 5 mg dexamethasone through intramuscular injection. His serum cortisol level was < 1.00 μg/dL and 4.39 μg/dL at 2 and 4 days after the injection, respectively. The final diagnosis was HPP of the non-familial type, suspected to be induced by dexamethasone injection. Finally, he was discharged without further sequela.

One year later, he came back to our emergency department due to hypokalemia-induced paralysis after eating a big carbohydrate-rich meal. We advised him to avoid using corticosteroids and eating carbohydrate-rich food.

Hypokalemia in the LINC trials

While the patient in this case example did not experience hypokalemia during several years of treatment, this electrolyte abnormality has occurred in clinical trials of osilodrostat treatment. In LINC 3, 18/137 participants (13%) experienced hypokalemia. Most serum potassium concentrations were maintained within the normal range, but a pattern was observed with greater decreases in mean serum potassium levels with increasing maximum concentration (C max) of osilodrostat. Grades 3 to 4 hypokalemia were reported in 7 patients, with the lowest reported serum potassium concentration of 2.4 mmol/L (normal range was 3.5–5.3 mmol/L). Hypokalemia was treated with potassium supplements, spironolactone, dose reduction or interruption, or a combination of these approaches. In our experience, if the potassium level is low-normal, then we may consider adding spironolactone, especially in women or in patients with hypertension. If the potassium level is below normal (i.e. < 3.5 mmol/L), then potassium supplementation should be administered, with follow-up lab tests to confirm normalization. Consideration can also be given to adding spironolactone to the regimen. While not common, osilodrostat dose interruption and intravenous potassium administration may be needed if more severe hypokalemia occurs and does not normalize with oral repletion and potassium-sparing medications.

### Treatment of hypophosphatemia in the intensive care unit: a review [^111jgz46]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

Correction of hypophosphatemia

With the high prevalence of hypophosphatemia in critically ill patients, as well as their susceptibility to life-threatening symptoms, frequent laboratory monitoring is recommended, especially in previously mentioned high-risk groups. It is generally recommended to correct hypophosphatemia in hypophosphatemic patients with associated symptoms. However, no randomized controlled evidence indicates whether correction of hypophosphatemia in apparently asymptomatic patients leads to improved outcome. Taking this into account, the indication for — and recommended frequency of — laboratory monitoring and treatment remains debatable.

Correction of hypophosphatemia is possible via oral or intravenous routes. Intravenous administration of phosphate is not without complications, though. Phosphate may precipitate with calcium. Large intravenous doses of phosphate may result in hyperphosphatemia, hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia, and hypotension. It is therefore necessary to know when intravenous therapy is indicated, and how much and how fast phosphate should be supplied. Intravenous therapy is generally recommended in symptomatic hypophosphatemia and phosphate levels < 0.32 mmol/L. Multiple studies have evaluated the efficacy and safety of intravenous phosphate repletion regimens (Table 4). These studies generally agree that aggressive phosphate supplementation is safe with phosphate doses up to 45 mmol with infusion rates up to 20 mmol per hour. Hyperkalemia is prevented by using sodium phosphate instead of potassium phosphate in patients with potassium levels > 4 mmol/L.

Table 4
Intravenous treatment of hypophosphatemia

iP, serum inorganic phosphate.

Moderate hypophosphatemia can be treated with oral supplementation of phosphate. One should keep in mind that active vitamin D is required for intestinal absorption of phosphate. Typical oral supplementation amounts are three times the normal daily intake, with advised amounts of 2.5 to 3.5 g (80 to 110 mmol) per day, divided over two to three doses. Patients who receive feeding after a period of starvation are often phosphate depleted, so additional phosphate should be added to nutritional preparations. An additional preventive strategy is to build up the caloric intake slowly. The total required amount of phosphate cannot be predicted by serum phosphate levels, as phosphate shifts between multiple body compartments.

Dipyridamole can decrease urinary phosphate loss. Further research is needed to establish further the role of this drug in the treatment of hypophosphatemia in critically ill patients.

### Quinapril hydrochloride / hydrochlorothiazide [^114GjYHf]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

General

Serum Electrolyte Abnormalities

In clinical trials, hyperkalemia (serum potassium ≥ 5.8 mmol/L) occurred in approximately 2% of patients receiving quinapril. In most cases, elevated serum potassium levels were isolated values which resolved despite continued therapy. Less than 0.1% of patients discontinued therapy due to hyperkalemia. Risk factors for the development of hyperkalemia include renal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus, and the concomitant use of other drugs that raise serum potassium levels.

Hydrochlorothiazide can cause hypokalemia and hyponatremia. Hypomagnesemia can result in hypokalemia which appears difficult to treat despite potassium repletion. Drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system can cause hyperkalemia. The risk of hyperkalemia may be increased in patients with renal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus or with concomitant use of drugs that raise serum potassium (see DRUG INTERACTIONS). The risk of hypokalemia may be increased in patients with cirrhosis, brisk diuresis, or with concomitant use of drugs that lower serum potassium. Monitor serum electrolytes periodically.

Other Metabolic Disturbances

Hydrochlorothiazide may alter glucose tolerance and raise serum levels of cholesterol and triglycerides.

Hydrochlorothiazide may raise the serum uric acid level due to reduced clearance of uric acid and may cause or exacerbate hyperuricemia and precipitate gout in susceptible patients.

Hydrochlorothiazide decreases urinary calcium excretion and may cause elevations of serum calcium. Monitor calcium levels in patients with hypercalcemia receiving quinapril and hydrochlorothiazide.

Cough

Presumably due to the inhibition of the degradation of endogenous bradykinin, persistent nonproductive cough has been reported with all ACE inhibitors, resolving after discontinuation of therapy. ACE inhibitor-induced cough should be considered in the differential diagnosis of cough.

Surgery/Anesthesia

In patients undergoing surgery or during anesthesia with agents that produce hypotension, quinapril will block the angiotensin II formation that could otherwise occur secondary to compensatory renin release. Hypotension that occurs as a result of this mechanism can be corrected by volume expansion.

### Potassium chloride (Pokonza) [^116ea4yE]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

2.1 Administration and Monitoring

Monitoring

Monitor serum potassium and adjust dosages accordingly. For treatment of hypokalemia, monitor potassium levels daily or more often depending on the severity of hypokalemia until they return to normal. Monitor potassium levels monthly to biannually for maintenance or prophylaxis.

The treatment of potassium depletion, particularly in the presence of cardiac disease, renal disease, or acidosis requires careful attention to acid-base balance, volume status, electrolytes, including magnesium, sodium, chloride, phosphate, and calcium, electrocardiograms and the clinical status of the patient. Correct volume status, acid-base balance and electrolyte deficits as appropriate.

Administration

Dilute the contents of 1 pouch of POKONZA™ in at least 4 ounces of cold water [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Take with meals or immediately after eating.

If serum potassium concentration is < 2.5 mEq/L, use intravenous potassium instead of oral supplementation.

2.2 Adult Dosing

Treatment of hypokalemia:

Daily dose range from 40 to 100 mEq. Give in 2 to 5 divided doses: limit doses to 40 mEq per dose. The total daily dose should not exceed 200 mEq in a 24 hour period.

Maintenance or Prophylaxis

Typical dose is 20 mEq per day. Individualize dose based upon serum potassium levels.

Studies support the use of potassium replacement in digitalis toxicity. When alkalosis is present, normokalemia and hyperkalemia may obscure a total potassium deficit. The advisability of use of potassium replacement in the setting of hyperkalemia is uncertain.

2.3 Pediatric Dosing

Treatment of hypokalemia:

Pediatric patients aged birth to 16 years old: The initial dose is 2 to 4 mEq/kg/day in divided doses; do not exceed as a single dose 1 mEq/kg or 40 mEq, whichever is lower; maximum daily doses should not exceed 100 mEq. If deficits are severe or ongoing losses are great, consider intravenous therapy.

Maintenance or Prophylaxis

Pediatric patients aged birth to 16 years old: Typical dose is 1 mEq/kg/day. Do not exceed 3 mEq/kg/day.

### ASN kidney health guidance on potassium and phosphorus food additives [^114XbkSR]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2025). High credibility.

Potassium additives — clinical relevance and homeostasis — Higher potassium consumption is shown to be associated with cardiovascular and kidney health, but as kidney function declines the risk of hyperkalemia increases and potassium additives are often overlooked as a source of potassium intake. There is strong evidence that dietary potassium can acutely raise serum potassium levels in the postprandial period, and once absorbed, potassium is shifted into the cells in an insulin-dependent and aldosterone-dependent process. Ingested potassium stimulates an acute kaliuretic response through feed-forward and feedback mechanisms with natriuretic effects, but these regulatory mechanisms are impaired as kidney function declines and are further blunted by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists.

### Serum potassium and outcomes in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: a post-hoc analysis of the PARAGON-HF trial [^116zioZH]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2021). Medium credibility.

Study treatment, follow‐up and laboratory measurements

Serum potassium and creatinine levels were measured at screening, during the run‐in period, at randomisation, 1 and 4 months following randomisation, and in 4‐month intervals thereafter at each study site. eGFR was calculated using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease formula.

By protocol, a patient with a serum potassium > 5.3 mmol/L at any time after randomisation required confirmation in a non‐haemolysed sample and further checks of potassium concentration until the potassium was stable and not rising into the range of concern (≥ 5.5 and < 6.0 mmol/L) or potential danger (≥ 6.0 mmol/L). Guidance was given on modification of trial treatment (including dose reduction or discontinuation), concomitant therapy and diet, to correct elevation in potassium. Hypokalaemia was managed at the discretion of the treating physician.

Endpoints

In the present analysis we studied the associations of serum potassium (categorical and continuous, using both the screening and time‐updated values) with: (i) the trial primary endpoint, a composite of total (first and recurrent) heart failure hospitalisations and cardiovascular death; (ii) total heart failure hospitalisations; (iii) cardiovascular death; (iv) non‐cardiovascular death; and (v) all‐cause death. There were too few sudden cardiac deaths and 'pump failure' deaths for meaningful analysis.

### Kaliuresis and intracellular uptake of potassium with potassium citrate and potassium chloride supplements: a randomized controlled trial [^113CbPL5]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

A potassium replete diet is associated with lower cardiovascular risk but may increase the risk of hyperkalemia, particularly in people using renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors. We investigated whether intracellular uptake and potassium excretion after an acute oral potassium load depend on the accompanying anion and/or aldosterone and whether this results in altered plasma potassium change.

Methods

In this placebo-controlled interventional cross-over trial including 18 healthy individuals, we studied the acute effects of one oral load of potassium citrate (40 mmol), potassium chloride (40 mmol), and placebo in random order after overnight fasting. Supplements were administered after a 6-week period with and without lisinopril pretreatment. Linear mixed effect models were used to compare blood and urine values before and after supplementation and between the interventions. Univariable linear regression was used to determine the association between baseline variables and change in blood and urine values after supplementation.

Results

During the 4-hour follow-up, the rise in plasma potassium was similar for all interventions. After potassium citrate, both red blood cell potassium-as measure of the intracellular potassium-and transtubular potassium gradient (TTKG)-reflecting potassium secretory capacity-were higher than after potassium chloride or potassium citrate with lisinopril pretreatment. Baseline aldosterone was significantly associated with TTKG after potassium citrate, but not after potassium chloride or potassium citrate with lisinopril pretreatment. The observed TTKG change after potassium citrate was significantly associated with urine pH change during this intervention (R = 0.60, P < 0.001).

Conclusions

With similar plasma potassium increase, red blood cell potassium uptake and kaliuresis were higher after an acute load of potassium citrate as compared with potassium chloride alone or pretreatment with lisinopril.

### Potassium management with finerenone: practical aspects [^114s2qxh]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

4.1 Recommendations for the management of potassium with Finerenone

In accordance with the US labelling prescribing information for finerenone, serum potassium and eGFR should be measured and finerenone should be dosed appropriately in all patients prior to initiation of treatment. Treatment with finerenone should not be initiated if serum potassium is > 5.0 mmol/L. Serum potassium should be monitored periodically, on a schedule similar to study visits in FIDELIO‐DKD and FIGARO‐DKD (Month 1, Month 4, and at 4‐month intervals thereafter) to minimize the risk of hyperkalemia. Importantly, such a schedule is actually similar with the usual biological monitoring recommended in CKD patients by the KDIGO 2012 guidelines (Figure 1).

FIGURE 1
Protocol for potassium management

If serum potassium concentrations are ≤ 4.8 mmol/L, the dose should be continued or increased to 20 mg per day (if the starting dose was 10 mg per day, i.e. for patients with a baseline eGFR 25 to < 60 ml/min/1.73 m²). If serum potassium concentrations are > 4.8‐ ≤ 5.5 mmol/L, the dose should be maintained at 10 mg daily or 20 mg daily. Serum potassium should be monitored 4 weeks after a dose adjustment and throughout treatment, and the dose adjusted as needed.

This is actually similar to the recommended procedure for RASi oversight, per KDIGO guidelines on diabetes management in CKD, which state "Monitor serum creatinine and potassium (within 2–4 weeks after starting or changing dose)". Finerenone should be temporarily discontinued if serum potassium concentrations are > 5.5 mmol/L and can be restarted at 10 mg daily when serum potassium concentrations are ≤ 5.0 mmol/L. Finerenone has a short half‐life of 2–3 h and no active metabolites; therefore, hyperkalemia can be treated by discontinuing treatment. For patients with moderate liver disease (Child‐Pugh B), additional potassium monitoring should be considered (Table 4).

### Clinical practice recommendations for the diagnosis and management of X-linked hypophosphataemia [^114YRUTN]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2019). High credibility.

Conventional treatment in children

Phosphate

Recommendations for conventional treatment in children with XLH are provided in Box 3. Oral phosphate supplements should always be provided together with active vitamin D, as phosphate alone promotes secondary hyperparathyroidism and thereby renal phosphate wasting. Treatment doses vary according to age and severity of phenotype, and no consensus exists on the optimal dose of oral phosphate. However, starting doses of 20–60 mg/kg body weight daily (0.7–2.0 mmol/kg daily) based on elemental phosphorus are recommended on the basis of the severity of the phenotype. Early treatment is associated with superior outcomes. Healing of rickets, as evidenced by the normalization of ALP levels and radiological signs, is the initial aim in children. Treatment also promotes growth, reduces bone pain, progressively corrects leg deformities and improves dental health. In infants diagnosed before they develop bone changes, the goal of treatment is to prevent rickets. Serum phosphate levels increase rapidly after oral intake but return to baseline concentrations within 1.5 hours. Thus, phosphate should be given as frequently as possible, for example, 4–6 times per day in young patients with high ALP levels, to maintain stable blood levels. Less frequent dosing (2–3 times daily) might improve adherence in adolescents. Fasting phosphate levels are not restored by oral phosphate supplements, and normalization of serum levels of phosphate is not a goal of conventional therapy. Phosphate supplements are available as oral solutions, capsules or tablets containing sodium-based and/or potassium-based salts. Dosages should always be based on elemental phosphorus given that the phosphorus content largely differs between the available phosphate salts. Oral solutions containing glucose-based sweeteners should be used with caution given the dental fragility of these patients. Phosphate should not be given together with calcium supplements or foods with high calcium content, such as milk, as precipitation in the intestinal tract reduces absorption.

### Potassium disorders: hypokalemia and hyperkalemia [^115KhjSU]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Hypokalemia and hyperkalemia are common electrolyte disorders caused by changes in potassium intake, altered excretion, or transcellular shifts. Diuretic use and gastrointestinal losses are common causes of hypokalemia, whereas kidney disease, hyperglycemia, and medication use are common causes of hyperkalemia. When severe, potassium disorders can lead to life-threatening cardiac conduction disturbances and neuromuscular dysfunction. Therefore, a first priority is determining the need for urgent treatment through a combination of history, physical examination, laboratory, and electrocardiography findings. Indications for urgent treatment include severe or symptomatic hypokalemia or hyperkalemia; abrupt changes in potassium levels; electrocardiography changes; or the presence of certain comorbid conditions. Hypokalemia is treated with oral or intravenous potassium. To prevent cardiac conduction disturbances, intravenous calcium is administered to patients with hyperkalemic electrocardiography changes. Insulin, usually with concomitant glucose, and albuterol are preferred to lower serum potassium levels in the acute setting; sodium polystyrene sulfonate is reserved for subacute treatment. For both disorders, it is important to consider potential causes of transcellular shifts because patients are at increased risk of rebound potassium disturbances.

### Narrative review: evolving concepts in potassium homeostasis and hypokalemia [^1162AKU9]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Humans are intermittently exposed to large variations in potassium intake, which range from periods of fasting to ingestion of potassium-rich meals. These fluctuations would abruptly alter plasma potassium concentration if not for rapid mechanisms, primarily in skeletal muscle and the liver, that buffer the changes in plasma potassium concentration by means of transcellular potassium redistribution and feedback control of renal potassium excretion. However, buffers have capacity limits, and even robust feedback control mechanisms require that the perturbation occur before feedback can initiate corrective action. In contrast, feedforward control mechanisms sense the effect of disturbances on the system's homeostasis. This review highlights recent experimental insights into the participation of feedback and feedforward control mechanisms in potassium homeostasis. New data make clear that feedforward homeostatic responses activate when decreased potassium intake is sensed, even when plasma potassium concentration is still within the normal range and before frank hypokalemia ensues, in addition to the classic feedback activation of renal potassium conservation when plasma potassium concentration decreases. Given the clinical importance of dyskalemias in patients, these novel experimental paradigms invite renewed clinical inquiry into this important area.

2.1 Administration and Monitoring

Monitoring

Monitor serum potassium and adjust dosages accordingly. For treatment of hypokalemia, monitor potassium levels daily or more often depending on the severity of hypokalemia until they return to normal. Monitor potassium levels monthly to biannually for maintenance or prophylaxis.

The treatment of potassium depletion, particularly in the presence of cardiac disease, renal disease, or acidosis requires careful attention to acid-base balance, volume status, electrolytes, including magnesium, sodium, chloride, phosphate, and calcium, electrocardiograms and the clinical status of the patient. Correct volume status, acid-base balance and electrolyte deficits as appropriate.

Administration

Dilute the potassium chloride oral solution with at least 4 ounces of cold water [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Take with meals or immediately after eating.

If serum potassium concentration is < 2.5 mEq/L, use intravenous potassium instead of oral supplementation.

2.2 Adult Dosing

Treatment of hypokalemia

Daily dose ranges from 40 to 100 mEq. Give in 2 to 5 divided doses; limit doses to 40 mEq per dose. The total daily dose should not exceed 200 mEq in a 24-hour period.

Maintenance or Prophylaxis

Typical dose is 20 mEq per day. Individualize dose based upon serum potassium levels.

Studies support the use of potassium replacement in digitalis toxicity. When alkalosis is present, normokalemia and hyperkalemia may obscure a total potassium deficit. The advisability of use of potassium replacement in the setting of hyperkalemia is uncertain.

2.3 Pediatric Dosing

Treatment of hypokalemia

Pediatric patients aged birth to 16 years old: The initial dose is 2 to 4 mEq/kg/day in divided doses; do not exceed as a single dose 1 mEq/kg or 40 mEq, whichever is lower; maximum daily doses should not exceed 100 mEq. If deficits are severe or ongoing losses are great, consider intravenous therapy.

Maintenance or Prophylaxis

Pediatric patients aged birth to 16 years old: Typical dose is 1 mEq/kg/day. Do not exceed 3 mEq/kg/day.

### Sodium zirconium cyclosilicate among individuals with hyperkalemia: a 12-month phase 3 study [^111keQJr]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Oral sodium zirconium cyclosilicate (formerly ZS-9) binds and removes potassium via the gastrointestinal tract. Sodium zirconium cyclosilicate-associated restoration and maintenance of normokalemia and adverse events were evaluated in a two-part, open label, phase 3 trial.

Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements

In the correction phase, adult outpatients with plasma potassium ≥ 5.1 mmol/L (i-STAT Point-of-Care) received sodium zirconium cyclosilicate 10 g three times daily for 24–72 hours until normokalemic (potassium = 3.5–5.0 mmol/L). Qualifying participants entered the ≤ 12-month maintenance phase and received sodium zirconium cyclosilicate 5 g once daily titrated to maintain normokalemia without dietary or medication restrictions. Prespecified primary end points were restoration of normal serum potassium values (3.5–5.0 mmol/L) during the correction phase and maintenance of serum potassium ≤ 5.1 mmol/L during the maintenance phase. Adverse events were assessed throughout.

Results

Of 751 participants, 746 (99%) achieved normokalemia during the correction phase (mean serum potassium = 4.8 mmol/L; 95% confidence interval, 4.7 to 4.8) and entered the maintenance phase; 466 (63%) participants completed the 12-month trial. Participants were predominantly white, men, and age ≥ 65 years old; 74% had an eGFR < 60 ml/min per 1.73 m², and 65% used renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors. Mean time on sodium zirconium cyclosilicate was 286 days. Mean daily sodium zirconium cyclosilicate dose was 7.2 g (SD = 2.6). Over months 3–12, mean serum potassium was 4.7 mmol/L (95% confidence interval, 4.6 to 4.7); mean serum potassium values ≤ 5.1 and ≤ 5.5 mmol/L were achieved by 88% and 99% of participants, respectively. Of 483 renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitor users at baseline, 87% continued or had their dose increased; 11% discontinued. Among 263 renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitor-naïve participants, 14% initiated renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitor therapy. Overall, 489 (66%) participants experienced adverse events during the maintenance phase, and 22% experienced a serious adverse event. Of eight (1%) deaths, none were considered related to sodium zirconium cyclosilicate. Nine (1%) and 34 (5%) participants experienced serum potassium < 3.0 and 3.0–3.4 mmol/L, respectively.

Conclusions

After achieving normokalemia, individualized once daily sodium zirconium cyclosilicate was associated with maintenance of normokalemia without substantial renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitor changes for ≤ 12 months.
