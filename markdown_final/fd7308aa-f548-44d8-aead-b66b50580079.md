## Question

58. Develop a SOAP note for a follow-up visit for managing diabetic neuropathy.

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking me to develop a SOAP note for a follow-up visit for diabetic neuropathy, preserving the thinking process and self-verification language throughout. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the subjective history elements that must be captured for neuropathic pain and autonomic symptoms. Then, I should verify the objective examination components, including bedside sensory testing and foot risk stratification. Next, I will assess the diagnosis and severity, including differential and comorbidities. After that, I need to review the plan, including glycemic optimization, pain management, foot care, and safety monitoring. Finally, I should confirm follow-up intervals, referrals, and patient education, making sure each element aligns with current guidelines and evidence-based practice.

> Let me first confirm the subjective history elements I must document to align with standards of care: onset and evolution of neuropathic symptoms, pain quality and distribution, functional impact on sleep, mood, and activities, medication adherence and adverse effects, and autonomic symptoms such as orthostatic dizziness, early satiety, erectile dysfunction, sweating changes, and dry skin, because these directly inform both diagnosis and management decisions [^111k4Mu3] [^111V5u5h] [^111m3RdG].

> Wait, let me verify the pain descriptors and functional impact I should explicitly elicit; guidelines emphasize distinguishing large-fiber features like numbness, tingling, and imbalance from small-fiber features such as burning, electric shocks, stabbing pain, hyperalgesia, and allodynia, and I should also screen for concurrent mood and sleep disorders since they influence pain perception and treatment response [^116bwurH] [^111m3RdG].

> I need to check the objective examination sequence next: inspect feet for deformities, calluses, fissures, and nail pathology; perform at least two bedside sensory tests including 10-g monofilament at the dorsal aspect of the great toes bilaterally and either pinprick or temperature for small fibers, plus vibration with a 128-Hz tuning fork for large fibers; assess ankle reflexes and proprioception; palpate dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses; and classify foot risk per international schemes to guide follow-up frequency [^111k4Mu3] [^112gxq6Y] [^115beQqe].

> Hold on, I should verify the risk stratification implications because they drive surveillance intervals; very low risk warrants annual exams, low risk every 6–12 months, moderate risk every 3–6 months, and high risk every 1–3 months, with patients who have loss of protective sensation or prior ulcer/amputation requiring foot inspection at every visit [^115beQqe] [^111D929J].

> Let me consider the assessment and plan structure; I will diagnose diabetic peripheral neuropathy clinically as a symmetric distal sensorimotor polyneuropathy, grade severity by distribution and modalities involved, and explicitly exclude atypical features that would prompt consideration of nondiabetic etiologies or electrodiagnostic testing; I should also screen for autonomic neuropathy and document comorbid mood, sleep, and cardiovascular risk factors that affect care [^111k4Mu3] [^112t3D2w] [^114iEaRm].

> I should confirm glycemic optimization as foundational disease-modifying therapy; for type 2 diabetes, optimizing glucose, blood pressure, and lipids slows progression, whereas for type 1 diabetes, intensive early glycemic control helps prevent or delay neuropathy; I need to ensure individualized A1C targets and consider GLP-1 receptor agonists or SGLT-2 inhibitors when indicated for cardiorenal benefit, while avoiding hypoglycemia, especially in older adults [^113soaDA] [^114GzJEj] [^112sobXc].

> Next, I should review pain management; first-line pharmacotherapies include pregabalin, duloxetine, or gabapentin, with venlafaxine, amitriptyline, or nortriptyline as alternatives, and I should counsel that a 30–50% pain reduction is a realistic goal and that I will reassess efficacy after about 12 weeks at a therapeutic dose; if response is inadequate, I should switch classes or combine agents rather than escalate a single drug indefinitely, and I must avoid opioids including tramadol and tapentadol given adverse effects and lack of superiority [^1175b89f] [^115MavDF] [^111m3RdG].

> Wait, I initially thought to include valproic acid as a sodium channel blocker option, but hold on, I should verify safety; the AAN advises against valproic acid for painful diabetic neuropathy due to serious adverse events and teratogenicity, so I should not recommend it except in rare, refractory circumstances and never in patients of childbearing potential, correcting my earlier inclination [^112AoS9B].

> I will now examine topical options for patients with contraindications to oral therapy or as adjuncts; capsaicin 8% patch applied in clinic, topical nitroglycerin spray, and topical lidocaine are reasonable considerations, and I should align the choice with patient preference, access, and tolerability [^1135RFSa] [^111Zn41Z].

> Let me think about nonpharmacologic management; I should prescribe structured exercise including aerobic, resistance, and balance training, reinforce weight management and dietary patterns higher in plant-based foods and polyunsaturated fats, and implement intensive foot care with daily inspection, emollients, padded socks, protective footwear, and professional nail care, especially for those with small-fiber involvement or deformity risk [^114aHrzR].

> I should double-check safety monitoring; at each visit I will reassess pain intensity using a 0–10 scale and document functional impact, screen for falls and dizziness, review mood and sleep, and check for medication adverse effects such as sedation, edema, and orthostasis; in older adults, I need to be vigilant for polypharmacy and orthostatic hypotension that increase fall risk [^111m3RdG] [^112FHAyk].

> Next, I should review referrals and follow-up cadence; if the presentation is atypical, rapidly progressive, asymmetric, or there is diagnostic uncertainty, I should refer to neurology for electrodiagnostic testing; for high-risk feet or active ulcers, I should involve podiatry and vascular surgery; for refractory pain, I should consider pain specialty referral and, in selected cases, discuss neuromodulation options such as spinal cord stimulation after failure of multiple agents [^114sa8mt] [^115beQqe] [^117HLAfx].

> I need to ensure patient education is explicit; I will explain that neuropathy is a chronic, progressive condition and that our goals are to slow progression, reduce pain by about 30–50%, preserve function, and prevent complications; I will teach daily foot inspection, proper footwear, and when to seek urgent care for wounds, infection, or color change, and I will connect the patient with diabetes self-management education and support to reinforce lifestyle and medication adherence [^111m3RdG] [^115M2B4t].

> Hold on, I should verify the follow-up interval and testing; routine visits every 3–6 months are reasonable for moderate neuropathy, with shorter intervals for high-risk feet, and at each visit I should repeat foot risk assessment and reinforce prevention; annual comprehensive foot exams remain standard, and I should document neuropathic pain assessment and treatment response to meet quality measures [^115beQqe] [^111D929J] [^117BdUVu].

> Finally, let me reconsider the entire care pathway to ensure alignment with guidelines: confirm clinical diagnosis with targeted history and at least two bedside tests, optimize glycemic and cardiovascular risk factors, treat pain with first-line nonopioid agents and consider combinations if needed, implement intensive foot care and risk-based surveillance, and coordinate referrals for atypical disease, high-risk feet, or refractory pain, documenting measurable goals and reassessment timelines to close the loop on quality and safety [^111k4Mu3] [^113soaDA] [^1175b89f].

It should also record **foot risk status** and the plan to optimize glycemic, blood pressure, and lipid control [^113soaDA]; adjust pain therapy to duloxetine, pregabalin, or gabapentin; avoid opioids [^1175b89f]; and reinforce foot care, falls risk assessment, and referrals to podiatry or pain management as indicated [^114aHrzR] [^112FHAyk] [^117Psa1u].

Diabetic neuropathy — diagnosis, screening, and management in diabetes mellitus are outlined as follows: Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is a clinical diagnosis, and a comprehensive differential diagnosis should be considered to rule out nondiabetic neuropathies. Screening for DPN should be done at diagnosis of type 2 diabetes (T2D), within 5 y of the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes (T1D), and subsequently annually and whenever symptoms occur, by clinical history and physical exam. Assessments for DPN should include a careful history of target symptoms and a combination of at least two tests: vibration sensation using a 128-Hz tuning fork, pinprick sensation, temperature discrimination, 10-g monofilament testing on the dorsal aspect of the great toe bilaterally, and ankle reflexes, following the typical DPN pattern starting distally on the hallux and moving proximally until a sensory threshold is identified. Screening for cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy (CAN) should be considered at diagnosis of T2D and at 5 y after the diagnosis of T1D (including youth), and also in the presence of DPN, CKD, 2 or more CVD risk factors, hypoglycemia unawareness, high glucose variability, heart failure, perioperatively, or with autonomic symptoms, with a careful differential to exclude mimics. CV reflex tests (deep breathing, Valsalva, supine to standing) remain the gold standard and are recommended for CAN; indices of heart rate variability from electrocardiogram recordings could be used as an earlier screening alternative. Diabetic foot exams should be performed at every visit (in person or virtual) to identify deformities and those at risk for ulcerations and amputations. Intensive glucose control applied as early as possible is recommended to prevent the onset of DPN and CAN in T1D; achieving optimal control of glucose, blood pressure, and lipids along with lifestyle interventions (including weight loss and exercise) are recommended to prevent DPN and CAN in T2D, and lifestyle interventions are effective for prevention in prediabetes/metabolic syndrome. For painful DPN, pregabalin, duloxetine, and capsaicin 8% patch are recommended, with evidence that these agents reach 30% to 50% reduction in pain in many individuals; gabapentin and some tricyclic antidepressants may also be as effective, and combination or switching among classes may provide greater benefits than maximizing a single agent. The use of opioids, including tramadol or tapentadol, is NOT RECOMMENDED due to risk; in refractory painful DPN, spinal cord stimulation with nonpharmacological approaches should be considered.

Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) diagnosis — clinical assessment and bedside testing — notes that there are several established clinical tests that may be easily used to assess small- and large-fiber function; in clinical care, assessment of pinprick and temperature (mostly cold) sensation provide reliable information on small-fiber function, whereas assessment of vibration perception (with a 128-Hz tuning fork), proprioception, light touch to 10-g monofilament, and ankle reflexes allow assessment of large-fiber function in a "stocking and glove" distribution; assessment of light touch perception using a 10-g monofilament should be performed on the dorsal aspect of the great toe bilaterally as recommended; however, the 10-g monofilament is a useful clinical tool mainly for detecting advanced neuropathy and identifying persons at increased risk of ulceration and amputation; the diagnosis of DPN is principally a clinical one and a combination of typical symptoms and symmetrical distal sensory loss is highly suggestive, with loss of ankle reflexes occurring early and later weakness of small foot muscles and dorsiflexors also observed.

### A pragmatic approach to improving management and patient flow for painful diabetic neuropathy in UK primary care [^113m2vuK]. Diabetes Therapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy (pDPN) affects approximately 25% of individuals with diabetes in the UK and remains underdiagnosed and suboptimally managed in primary care. The condition causes chronic pain, limits daily functioning, impairs quality of life, and increases the risk of complications like foot ulcers and amputations due to underlying neuropathy. Current care pathways are fragmented, leading to delays in diagnosis and limited access to evidence-based therapies. This article aims to address the challenges of screening, diagnosis, and management of pDPN in UK primary care by proposing a consensus-driven, five-step pragmatic strategy.

Methods

An expert panel of general practitioners and a diabetes nurse practitioner from across the UK convened to review and discuss strategies for improving pDPN care. Consensus was reached through an evaluation of barriers in clinical practice, supported by real-world experience and examples of innovative care delivery models, resulting in the development of practical recommendations and workflow.

Results

Key barriers identified include insufficient training of healthcare professionals in pDPN, underutilisation of validated screening tools such as the DN4 questionnaire, and inconsistent and outdated treatment guidelines. To address these challenges, a five-step approach was proposed to include screening high-risk patients using validated questionnaires, following up on these patients to enable early diagnoses, initiating early treatments with first-line therapies while monitoring responses, referring complex cases to secondary care on the basis of structured criteria, and ensuring coordinated follow-up to streamline and optimise care delivery. Case studies demonstrate the practical application of these strategies in improving early detection, treatment adherence, and long-term care for individuals with pDPN.

Conclusion

Current practices have fallen short in providing adequate care for one in four individuals with diabetes. Implementing a straightforward five-step approach can significantly improve diagnostic accuracy and treatment outcomes, reducing the burden of pDPN on both patients and society.

Module A: T2DM management — The algorithm begins with a patient with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and first asks whether there is an urgent or emergent care need (e.g., symptomatic hyperglycemia, severe hypoglycemia, concurrent medical issue); if yes, treat and/or refer for acute care, and if no, assess barriers to success (e.g., psychosocial needs, navigating health care, health literacy/numeracy, patient/provider inertia, social determinants of health [e.g., transportation, economic or food insecurity]). The next step is to develop an individualized treatment plan reviewing non‑pharmacologic therapies (Medical Nutrition Therapy including weight management; Diabetes Self‑Management Education and Support; exercise), and if pharmacologic therapy is indicated, begin metformin unless contraindicated. The algorithm then evaluates whether the patient has any of the following: established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) or high ASCVD risk, diabetic neuropathy, or heart failure; if yes, consider GLP‑1 RA or SGLT‑2 inhibitor if indicated, and if no, assess whether the glycemic target has been achieved (A1C 7.0–8.5% for most patients or alternative range based on individualization). If the target has not been achieved, consider additional medications until the target A1C range is achieved and select the agent based on efficacy and risk‑benefit ration; if the target has been achieved, review the treatment plan to minimize or treat complications and/or comorbidities.

Methods

Trial Design and Randomization

We conducted the Preventing Diabetic Foot Ulcers Through Cleaner Feet trial as a single-center, double-blind (participant, outcome assessor), placebo-controlled, parallel group, phase 2b randomized clinical trial (RCT) at the Baltimore Veterans Affairs (VA) Medical Center. Enrollment occurred between January 29, 2019, and December 7, 2021, with 1 year of follow-up. This RCT was approved by the institutional review board of the University of Maryland Baltimore and the VA Research and Development Committee of the VA Maryland Health Care System (VAMHCS). Recruitment involved obtaining written informed consent from participating veterans enrolled in the VAMHCS. We vouch for the accuracy and completeness of the data and for the fidelity of the trial to the protocol (Supplement 1). We followed the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials reporting guideline.

Enrolled participants who met eligibility criteria and returned for a randomization visit were randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, to receive either wipes containing soap and water (control group) or wipes containing 2% chlorhexidine (chlorhexidine group) (Figure 1). Randomization was not stratified. The VAMHCS Geriatric Research Education and Clinical Center Biostatistics group generated the randomization sequence using a computer-generated permuted block scheme with random block sizes and a maximum block size of 6. Study physicians, clinical coordinators, microbiology laboratory technicians, the principal investigator, and participants were blinded to the treatment assignment.

Principle 3: individualized treatment and scheduled follow-up

Management of diabetic peripheral neuropathy remains a challenge for health care providers because none of the currently available treatments effectively target underlying pathogenesis. Furthermore, diabetic peripheral neuropathy is a progressive disorder that can cause irreversible nerve damage. Thus, individualized treatment and scheduled follow-up are interdependent. The main objectives of treatment are intensive glycemic control and management of neuropathic pain alongside one or all of the following: diabetes self-management education and support; lifestyle optimization; adequate foot care and proper or therapeutic footwear; and multifactorial control of cardiovascular risk factors.

PDN is particularly difficult to manage and current treatment options include pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic interventions. Four classes of oral pharmacologic interventions are recommended for treatment: gabapentinoids (gabapentin, mirogabalin, and pregabalin); serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (desvenlafaxine, duloxetine, and venlafaxine); tricyclic antidepressants (amitriptyline, imipramine, and nortriptyline); and sodium channel blockers (carbamazepine, lacosamide, lamotrigine, oxcarbazepine, and valproic acid). Topical treatment with capsaicin may be considered in patients with contraindications to oral pharmacotherapy or a preference for topical pain management. Due to their adverse events profile and high abuse potential, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors/opioid dual mechanism agents (tapentadol and tramadol) are currently not recommended for treating PDN. Unfortunately, pharmacologic intervention seldom achieves complete resolution of neuropathic pain due to limited efficacy, dose-limiting adverse events, or both. Therefore, a standardized approach to combining pharmacotherapies is an unmet medical need and remains an area of intense study.

Spinal cord stimulation is an emerging therapeutic adjunct for the management of PDN. This type of non-pharmacologic intervention — referred to as neuromodulation — effectively relieves pain, improves neurological function, and enhances quality of life. High-quality evidence supports the use of either invasive or non-invasive neuromodulation for the treatment of patients with PDN that is refractory to pharmacologic intervention.

Finally, health care providers should remember that patients with asymmetrical distribution of clinical signs and symptoms or an unclear diagnosis require prompt referral to a neurologist for confirmatory electrophysiological testing.

### SEE-diabetes, a patient-centered diabetes self-management education and support for older adults: findings and information needs from providers' perspectives [^115XNzKf]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2022). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Diabetes self-management education and support (DSMES) can improve clinical and health outcomes of people with diabetes. However, DSMES has been underutilized because of many barriers. We aimed to develop a patient-centered educational aid, SEE-Diabetes (Support-Engage-Empower-Diabetes), that facilitates shared decision-making about DSMES between patient and provider during the follow-up visit. We investigated the information needs to inform the design of the SEE-Diabetes from the providers' perspective.

Methods

We conducted an online survey (N = 42) and three focus groups (N = 13) involving providers who have experience managing diabetes in older patients. Survey collected demographics and assessed knowledge of DSMES. During the subsequent focus groups, participants evaluated the Assessment and Plan section of three clinic notes of older people with diabetes. We also demonstrated the potential workflow of DSMES documentation using SEE-Diabetes during clinical practice.

Results

The survey showed 60% of providers were familiar with DSMES. Focus group findings showed clinic notes should convey concise information at an appropriate reading level, numbered problems, and less medical jargon to improve the readability of clinic notes. Application of SMART (Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, Time-bound) goals was suggested to deliver effective diabetes self-care information.

Conclusions

Providers should consider adopting validated DSMES guidelines along with goal-setting strategies to provide patient-centered care. The research team will integrate the provider recommendations when we develop SEE-Diabetes.

### The 10-year follow-up of a community-based cohort of people with diabetes: the incidence of foot ulceration and death [^117Lz1z6]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Data from the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) shows 537 million adults worldwide have a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus in 2022, and this is predicted to rise to 643 million by 2030. The complications of diabetes can cause premature death and considerable morbidity for people who have a diagnosis of diabetes. Complications affecting the lower limb include vascular and sensory impairment (ischemia and neuropathy) both of which can result in foot ulceration, soft tissue infections and ultimately lower limb amputations. There are high healthcare costs associated with these outcomes and managing complications which affect the lower limb requires the greatest proportion of healthcare expenditure for people with diabetes.

Identifying those who are likely to experience a foot ulcer is an important part of preventative care with national and International Diabetes Clinical Guidelines traditionally recommending that annual foot risk assessments are conducted to categorise a person's risk of developing a foot ulcer as either low/moderate or high.

Many cohort studies have been developed to predict the risk of foot ulceration and/or lower limb amputations, and not all have been externally validated. Even more rare are reports of patient outcomes followed up over the longer term.

More recently, analyses of patients' routinely collected data have shown the risk of death is considerably higher than that of developing a foot ulcer for people with diabetes and people with diabetes who experience foot ulcers have also been found to have a greater risk of death than those who do not.

An author of this manuscript previously published the results of a cohort study conducted between 2006 and 2008 which aimed to quantify the predictive value of elements of clinical history, diagnostic test results and symptoms and signs for foot ulceration in the general diabetes population recruited in a community healthcare setting. People registered with the NHS Tayside podiatry service in Scotland gave consent for their health data to be collected and analysed (n = 1193) and were followed up for an average period of 11 months between 2007 and 2008. The average age of the participants was 70 years, there were almost equal numbers of men and women, and the average duration of diabetes was almost 9 years. These demographic features were comparable to the wider diabetes population in Scotland. Only 23 participants experienced a foot ulcer within the original follow‐up period giving rise to concerns about the accuracy of the model. As part of a wider research project, we sought additional consent from the participants of the original cohort with diabetes to conduct a long‐term follow‐up of outcomes.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS

We enrolled 108 diabetic patients and 36 healthy control subjects. The diabetic subjects were divided into those at low risk for developing foot ulceration and those at high risk, according to their neuropathic status. The exclusion criteria were presence of foot ulceration at the time of recruitment, clinically present peripheral arterial disease, end-stage renal disease (patients on renal dialysis or kidney transplantation), and any other serious chronic disease that can affect wound healing. For the comparison between diabetic patients with and without foot ulceration, we used a group of seven diabetic patients with active foot ulceration (6 male subjects, aged 55 ± 11 years). The protocol was approved by the institutional review board of the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. All participants gave written informed consent.

Baseline visit.

All subjects attended the Joslin-Beth Israel Deaconess Foot Center and the General Clinical Research Center where they had a full physical examination and all tests described below. All diabetic patients received education about foot care and were seen regularly by their podiatrist as required.

Exit visit.

All diabetic patients were asked to return for a follow-up visit at ~18–24 months, whereas the healthy control subjects only were seen during the baseline visit. The same types of tests that were performed during the baseline also were performed at the exit visit.

DFU development and treatment.

Participants were asked to contact the study coordinator in case of the development of foot ulceration or any other adverse event. In addition, they were contacted over regular periods of time by the study coordinator. Treatment for any ulceration that occurred during the study was provided at the Joslin-Beth Israel Deaconess Foot Center according to standard guidelines. The cause of the foot ulceration and its progression were recorded.

Clinical and laboratory assessments.

Serum was analyzed for the measurements of inflammatory cytokines, growth factors, and biochemical markers of endothelial function using a Luminex 200 apparatus (Luminex, Austin, TX) and Millipore multiplex immunoassay panels (Millipore, Chicago, IL).

Diabetic foot disorders — risk for Charcot joint disease notes that less than 1% of persons with diabetes will develop Charcot joint disease. A population-based prospective study reported an incidence of about 8.5 per 1,000 persons with diabetes per year, equating to 0.85% per year, and the incidence is likely underestimated because many cases go undetected, especially in early stages. Primary risk factors are dense peripheral sensory neuropathy, normal circulation, and preceding trauma (often minor), and foot deformities, prior amputations, joint infections, or surgical trauma may provide sufficient stress to lead to Charcot joint disease.

Painful diabetic neuropathy (PDN) assessment and counseling — Level B recommendations state that clinicians should assess patients with diabetes for peripheral neuropathic pain and its effect on these patients' function and quality of life (Level B), and when initiating pharmacologic intervention for PDN, clinicians should counsel patients that the goal of therapy is to reduce, and not necessarily to eliminate, pain (Level B). Clinicians should assess patients with PDN for the presence of concurrent mood and sleep disorders and treat them as appropriate (Level B), noting that patients with diabetes are more likely to have mood and sleep disorders than the general population; mood and sleep can both influence pain perception, and treating concurrent mood and sleep disorders may help reduce pain and improve quality of life. To set expectations, the guideline notes that approximately 30% pain reduction is considered a success in clinical trials.

PDSA cycle 3

Prior to cycle 3 and following feedback from clinical staff, a care bundle was developed which was to be placed in the patients' ward admission notes (figure 3). It incorporated all aspects of the 'Check, Protect and Refer' ethos of the campaign. Important key members of staff indicated they felt they lacked training in assessment of foot neuropathy and subsequently were not confident in undertaking foot assessment. Aiming to address these concerns, two options for the assessment of peripheral neuropathy were detailed with diagrams explaining the process. Other issues which had arose included lack of knowledge regarding subsequent steps in the management process, and difficulties in remembering to actively insert the stickers into the medical notes when a patient with diabetes was identified. The new bundle addressed both of these issues and it became a core component of a patient with diabetes admission, with information available on the local referral process for staff to consult. This care bundle was initially trialled on five patients with feedback obtained.

Includes advice on protection and referral process. Provides staff information on assessing for peripheral neuropathy via two methods.

PDSA cycle 4

The final cycle was conducted on one ward in order to focus the implementation of the care bundle to one clinical unit. The ward was provided with the care bundle and added them to hospital ward admission packs. At the end of a 1-week period the medical notes of the patients on the ward were reviewed in a snapshot of clinical practice. Eleven of the patients in the ward had a documented history of diabetes and were therefore eligible for medical note review to assess whether a foot assessment had taken place and if the care bundle had been completed.

Recommendations

All patients should be screened for distal symmetric polyneuropathy (DPN) at diagnosis and at least annually thereafter using simple clinical tests. (B)
Electrophysiological testing is rarely needed, except in situations where the clinical features are atypical. (E)
Screening for signs and symptoms of cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy should be instituted at diagnosis of type 2 diabetes and 5 years after the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes. Special testing is rarely needed and may not affect management or outcomes. (E)
Medications for the relief of specific symptoms related to DPN and autonomic neuropathy are recommended, as they improve the quality of life of the patient. (E)

The diabetic neuropathies are heterogeneous with diverse clinical manifestations. They may be focal or diffuse. Most common among the neuropathies are chronic sensorimotor DPN and autonomic neuropathy. Although DPN is a diagnosis of exclusion, complex investigations to exclude other conditions are rarely needed.

The early recognition and appropriate management of neuropathy in the patient with diabetes is important for a number of reasons: 1) nondiabetic neuropathies may be present in patients with diabetes and may be treatable; 2) a number of treatment options exist for symptomatic diabetic neuropathy; 3) up to 50% of DPN may be asymptomatic, and patients are at risk of insensate injury to their feet; 4) autonomic neuropathy may involve every system in the body; and 5) cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy causes substantial morbidity and mortality. Specific treatment for the underlying nerve damage is not currently available, other than improved glycemic control, which may slow progression but not reverse neuronal loss. Effective symptomatic treatments are available for some manifestations of DPN and autonomic neuropathy.

### Polyneuropathy quality measurement set: quality improvement in neurology [^114upDsv]. Neurology (2022). High credibility.

Polyneuropathy pain improvement measure — improvement is defined as 30% reduction in scale score for the first index score in the patient record, the index score does not reset annually, and there is no expectation of 100% improvement; the original index score is used through time to monitor improvement of 30% or greater, as evidence supports patients can expect a 30%–50% improvement over time with appropriate treatment, with patients possibly lost to the numerator when they are not seen at 12 months (± 60 days); validated 10-point or 100-point pain scales are now standard in practice, so no new data collection burden is anticipated.

### A framework to assess clinical safety and hallucination rates of LLMs for medical text summarisation [^115gF8Ag]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Grading hallucinations and omissions by clinical safety impact

Inspired by protocols in medical device certifications, we applied the clinical safety assessment of our framework described in the methods section. We classified the clinical risk (Major or Minor) and evaluated the risk severity of all identified major hallucinations as depicted in Fig. 4. We also determined the risk of hallucinations based on their type and where in the sentence they occurred (Fig. 5).

Fig. 4
Severity of risk in major hallucinations.

We assessed the clinical risk resulting from major hallucinations based on our suggested framework.

Fig. 5
Hallucination risk assessment.

We have categorised the clinician severity of hallucination risks based on their type (a) and the section of the clinical notes where they occurred (b).

We assessed the clinical risk resulting from major hallucinations based on our suggested framework inspired by protocols in medical device certifications.

We conducted the risk assessment on the omissions (Fig. 6 a) and detailed the note section that would likely have been affected (Fig. 6 b). Major omissions were most common in current issues, followed by PMFS, and Info and Plan sections (55%, 35%, and 10%, respectively).

Fig. 6
Severity of clinical risk for major omissions and the section of the clinical note where they most occurred.

This figure illustrates the clinical risk severity due to major omissions (a) and indicates the sections of the notes where they are most likely to occur (b).

Examples of hallucinations and omissions are available in the supplementary materials.

Iterative experiments can significantly reduce hallucination and omission rates in LLM-generated clinical notes

Through a series of 18 iterative experiments, we tested a combination of prompting and workflow strategies, including structured prompting, atomisation, function calls and JSON-based outputs, an additional LLM revision step, and templating (SOAP -Subjective, Objective, Assessment, plan- note), which are explained in more detail in the methods section.

Modifying the prompt from the baseline used in Experiment 1 to include a style update used in Experiment 8, resulted in a reduction of both major and minor omissions. Although there was a slight increase in hallucinations in Experiment 8, these were mostly minor. Figure 7 illustrates the number of hallucinations and omissions recorded in Experiments 1 and 8.

### Diabetic neuropathies: update on definitions, diagnostic criteria, estimation of severity, and treatments [^113a611X]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

Diabetic polyneuropathy is one of the most common long-term complications of diabetes affecting ∼50% of all diabetic people. This review by an international panel of experts examines recent literature regarding diagnostic criteria for DPN, painful DPN, and autonomic neuropathy and makes diagnostic recommendations in the context of clinical practice and research. The review also discusses emerging markers of DPN. Finally, the diagnostic criteria for DPN are likely to evolve with developments in the field, and there is clearly a need for experts in the field to provide periodic updates.

Avoidance of Opioid Medications for Patients With Diabetic Neuropathy — measure definition, rationale, and exclusions: This measure assesses the percentage of patients with diabetic neuropathy who are taking opioid medications; it is an inverse measure where a lower score is desirable, and zero percent performance is not the goal, with users advised to establish a baseline for benchmarking. This is an intermediate outcome measure and, based on current evidence on treatment options for patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN), opioids are not indicated as a treatment for pain for patients with DPN. Reported utilization highlights the need for this measure: opioids were used as first-line agents for DPN (33.33%) compared to pregabalin (5.66%); 62% of patients were prescribed a short-acting opioid; out of 14,426 patients with peripheral neuropathy, 65.9% received at least one opioid prescription; and, even excluding other chronic pain conditions, almost 9% of patients with polyneuropathy are prescribed opioids for more than 90 consecutive days. Exclusions are specified as follows: required exclusions prevent entry into the denominator and include an opioid prescription from a different clinician; allowable exclusions can only help performance and include patients counseled on the last visit of the calendar year with agreement to discontinue opioid medication, patients receiving opioids in a controlled/monitored program to manage an opioid dependency (e.g., a methadone maintenance program), patients with active diagnosis of cancer during the measurement period, and patients admitted to hospice care or at end of life.

### Retinopathy, neuropathy, and foot care: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^111k4Mu3]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Diabetic neuropathy — screening recommendations state that all people with diabetes should be assessed for diabetic peripheral neuropathy starting at diagnosis of type 2 diabetes and 5 years after the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes and at least annually thereafter (B). Assessment for distal symmetric polyneuropathy should include a careful history and assessment of either temperature or pinprick sensation (small-fiber function) and vibration sensation using a 128-Hz tuning fork (for large-fiber function), and all people with diabetes should have annual 10-g monofilament testing to identify feet at risk for ulceration and amputation (B). Symptoms and signs of autonomic neuropathy should be assessed starting at diagnosis of type 2 diabetes and 5 years after the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes, and at least annually thereafter; screening can include asking about orthostatic dizziness, syncope, early satiety, erectile dysfunction, changes in sweating patterns, or dry cracked skin in the extremities, and signs include orthostatic hypotension, a resting tachycardia, or evidence of peripheral dryness or anhidrosis of the skin (E).

### Diabetic foot disorders. A clinical practice guideline (2006 revision) [^117VYDTw]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2007). Medium credibility.

Neurologic evaluation — Peripheral sensory neuropathy is the major risk factor for diabetic foot ulceration, and bedside testing can identify risk; specifically, the patient history and physical examination utilizing the 5.07 Semmes-Weinstein monofilament (10-g) wire are sufficient, and vibration perception threshold assessment with the biothesiometer is also useful in identifying patients at high risk for ulceration; nerve conduction studies are rarely necessary and usually add little to clinical management in patients with profound sensory neuropathy and neuropathic ulcerations.

### Polyneuropathy quality measurement set: quality improvement in neurology [^111dHC76]. Neurology (2022). High credibility.

Polyneuropathy quality measurement set — methods and development: The work group developed 3 measures to address known gaps, the AANI provides these measures for individual physicians and clinicians as well as treatment teams or practices, and benchmarks for performance are not provided; measure implementers are encouraged to benchmark performance and use their individual scores to identify areas for improvement. Implementing too many measures at one time is burdensome, and opting to use 1 or 2 measures is encouraged. A literature search identified 2,758 abstracts from EMBASE and MEDLINE and was winnowed to 129 articles. Per the AAN's measure development process, work groups are encouraged to create a small number of meaningful measures based on strong evidence, feasibility, and gaps in care. A majority vote from a quorum of work group members was required to advance measures to public comment, and members with any potential conflicts of interest are instructed to abstain from voting. A 30-day public comment period was held on 3 draft measures (one of which is a paired measure having 2 denominators and 2 numerators). The 3 measure concepts were edited in response to public comment and finalized, after which the work group, AAN's Quality Measure Subcommittee, Quality Committee, and Board of Directors voted and approved the measurement set. Although the article references neurologists, these measures can be utilized by any clinician managing PDN (painful diabetic neuropathy).

Glucose Control from Baseline to End of Follow-up in Users of the Tool Compared with Controls

We also aimed to assess more long-term outcomes. The randomization groups were merged after the initial 12-week period to enable all patients to use the tool during an extended open-label period (Fig. 1). Twenty-seven participants had reported medication changes during the follow-up period and were therefore excluded from analysis. All remaining 297 participants had a routine clinical measurement of HbA1c within 18 months after inclusion; the value nearest to 1 year after inclusion in the study was used for comparisons. The average time between inclusion and final HbA1c measurement was 359 days (interquartile range 288–432). A total of 106 participants never used the tool despite having access to it (Table 2). Reported reasons included lack of time, a sense that their diabetes was already under good control, and personal or family issues that received higher priority. Those who used the tool (n = 191) did on average complete 13 themes during follow-up.

Baseline characteristics of participants with T2D in long-term follow-up

Data are n (%) or mean (SD). Percentages may not total 100 because of rounding

a The body mass index is the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in metres

b Include known retinopathy, neuropathy, nephropathy or diabetic foot disease

c Comorbidities were reported by participants in conjunction with questionnaires, classified manually into different disease categories and presented as presence in % of cases

Comparison Between Users of the Tool and Non-users

The change of HbA1c from baseline to end of follow-up was compared between participants who used the tool and participants who did not use it. Those who used it had a 1 mmol/mol average reduction of HbA1c (95% CI − 1.4 to 0.4; n = 191), while HbA1c increased by 2 mol/mol on average in non-users (95% CI 0.7–2.7; n = 106). The mean difference between the groups was − 2 mmol/mol (95% CI − 4 to − 1; P = 0.02; P = 0.001 after adjusting for age, sex and BMI; P = 0.001 after adjusting for diabetic complications and P = 0.002 after adjusting for comorbidities).
