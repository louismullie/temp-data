## Question

Could you provide a table listing vasopressors and their dosing?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a table that lists vasopressors and their dosing. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about which vasopressors are in scope and the overarching guideline framework. Then, I should verify dosing ranges and preparation details for each agent. Next, I will map each drug to its clinical role and sequencing. After that, I need to check administration issues like infusion route, targets, and monitoring. Finally, I will examine safety thresholds and mortality signals and close with special scenarios and caveats anchored to evidence quality.

> Let me first confirm the agent landscape and the high-level hierarchy across syndromes. Norepinephrine is the recommended first-line vasopressor in septic shock and broadly in vasodilatory shock, with consistent endorsements across Surviving Sepsis and other condition-specific guidelines, including acute liver failure and cardiogenic shock, which anchors the initial choice in most ICU contexts [^112dBiCH] [^1126s6cY] [^116k5k9M] [^114KwXEg].

> I will now examine dosing specifics and preparation details, but wait, let me verify each number and its source before I state it. For norepinephrine, due to its short half-life under about 2.5 minutes, continuous infusion is required; manufacturers recommend dextrose-containing diluents because of oxidation in saline, and commonly used preparation concentrations range from 16 to 128 mcg/mL, with many centers using 64 mcg/mL; short-term peripheral infusion at low dose has emerging safety data when carefully monitored, though central access remains preferred in ICU practice [^1113yHrZ]. For vasopressin, I should confirm the two clinically distinct ranges: 0.01–0.03 units/min is consistently used for norepinephrine-sparing adjunctive effect, while some sources describe 0.03–0.06 IU/min in refractory vasoplegia, but I need to note the latter comes from lower-credibility guidance and should be individualized to context [^115qRmYj] [^111rgkqh]. For epinephrine, I only see a median maximum of 25 mcg/min reported in a DHP calcium channel blocker toxicity cohort, which is helpful for toxicology scenarios but not generalizable to sepsis; I should flag that limitation explicitly [^112kY4ZB]. For dopamine, the NEJM trial protocol capped dopamine at 20 mcg/kg/min, which serves more as a protocol ceiling than a universally recommended maximum dose [^116Y4EwT]. I cannot find specific dosing ranges in these materials for phenylephrine or angiotensin II, so I will avoid extrapolating and will instead point to their roles and labeling where applicable.

> Next, I should review clinical roles and sequencing to avoid jumping to conclusions about "best" agents without context. Norepinephrine is first-line; if MAP remains inadequate, adding vasopressin rather than simply escalating norepinephrine further is suggested by SSC and also echoed in COVID-19 ICU guidance, which helps standardize second-line choices in distributive shock contexts [^1126s6cY] [^112JTsNU]. Epinephrine is an additive agent for refractory shock; it reliably raises MAP but can raise lactate via beta-2 stimulation, complicating perfusion assessment, so I need to ensure I interpret lactate trends cautiously if epinephrine is onboard [^112pNbmR]. Phenylephrine is a complementary vasopressor and is FDA-indicated for hypotension primarily due to vasodilation, but observational signals linked its substitution during norepinephrine shortages with increased mortality; correlation is not causation, yet I should be conservative with early phenylephrine use unless phenotype or rhythm issues favor it [^112pNbmR] [^116JW8xy]. Dopamine is less favored due to tachyarrhythmias and was inferior to norepinephrine in cardiogenic shock subgroup analyses, so it is best reserved for carefully selected patients with low arrhythmia risk or relative bradycardia, if at all [^116Y4EwT]. For catecholamine-refractory vasoplegia, angiotensin II can be considered as a rescue to reduce catecholamine requirements, with the understanding that robust mortality benefits have not been established [^111aqrXk].

> Now, I need to check administration logistics and targets because these often drive bedside decisions as much as drug choice. Continuous infusions titrated to a MAP target of about 65 mmHg are standard for initial resuscitation in sepsis and COVID-19 shock, with permissive targets of 60–65 mmHg reasonable in older patients; route-wise, central venous access is preferred, but short-term peripheral infusions may be acceptable if a large-vein site and vigilant extravasation monitoring are assured, which is especially helpful when central access is delayed [^112dBiCH] [^1133W4TG] [^111DdU68] [^115ne9XC]. Let me also confirm that dextrose-containing diluents are recommended for norepinephrine to mitigate oxidation, which I already noted above and will ensure is reflected in order sets and pharmacy prep notes [^1113yHrZ].

> I should double-check the safety thresholds and mortality signals before suggesting escalation ceilings. A retrospective ICU study identified an inflection in mortality around norepinephrine 18 mcg/min and cumulative approximately 17.6 mg; while not prescriptive, these burden thresholds can prompt early adjuncts, endocrine optimization, or reconsideration of goals in context, and I need to be careful not to treat them as futility cutoffs [^114yuCzV]. Systematic reviews and trials suggest that lower vasopressor exposure probably lowers mortality in vasodilatory hypotension, and a randomized trial in older ICU patients achieved reduced vasopressor exposure with a MAP target of 60–65 mmHg; I should emphasize signal directionality without overstating survival effects where confidence is moderate or results neutral [^11518pmj] [^113RtDeo] [^115wZ7i6]. I must also recall epinephrine's propensity to increase lactate and phenylephrine's concerning association during shortage substitution, and weigh dopamine's arrhythmia risk against any theoretical advantages in bradycardia phenotypes [^112pNbmR] [^116Y4EwT].

> Let me consider how to quantify and communicate cumulative vasopressor exposure, because decision-making often hinges on the "catecholamine burden". Norepinephrine-equivalent dosing schemes and the cardiovascular SOFA framework provide a common language for cross-agent summation and prognostication, but I should verify that bedside decisions are never made on a single parameter; integrating tissue perfusion and organ function trends with dose trajectories is crucial [^112M836K] [^115p4xNp].

> I will now examine special scenarios to avoid overgeneralization. In cardiogenic shock, norepinephrine is often preferred to maintain perfusion pressure while minimizing tachyarrhythmias, and overall strategy is to use the lowest effective dose and shortest duration given myocardial oxygen cost; epinephrine may be used selectively, recognizing tachycardia and lactate effects, and combinations with inodilators or mechanical support are frequently needed when contractility is the primary deficit [^116axTfw] [^114KwXEg]. In severe acidosis with catecholamine hyporesponsiveness, vasopressin and even methylene blue can be considered as salvage for vasoplegia, ideally while correcting the underlying derangements [^115JDtMB]. In acute liver failure, norepinephrine remains first-line for refractory hypotension, aligning hepatology guidance with critical care practice [^116k5k9M]. For traumatic brain injury, practice varies between norepinephrine and phenylephrine early after injury with the aim of supporting cerebral perfusion, but choice is heterogeneous and high-quality comparative effectiveness data are limited, so I need to individualize to CPP targets and patient phenotype [^113YDf3t].

> Hold on, I should verify and transparently self-correct any overstatements from the initial trace. I initially noted vasopressin at 0.03–0.06 IU/min and implied a mortality benefit; wait, higher-quality randomized data do not demonstrate consistent survival benefit when adding vasopressin to norepinephrine, though a norepinephrine-sparing effect is consistent and renal replacement therapy reductions have been observed in some analyses, so I should frame vasopressin primarily as an adjunct that reduces catecholamine dose rather than a mortality intervention [^115qRmYj] [^1126s6cY]. I also referenced an epinephrine "median maximal rate" of 25 mcg/min from a DHP calcium channel blocker toxicity cohort; let me emphasize that this reflects toxicology practice rather than septic shock dosing norms, and should not guide typical sepsis titration strategies [^112kY4ZB]. Finally, phenylephrine's association with increased mortality during a norepinephrine shortage is observational and confounded; I should caution against early phenylephrine use without implying causality [^112pNbmR].

> Next, I should review practical de-escalation and weaning supports. Adjunctive oral midodrine has been studied as a vasopressor-sparing strategy and may reduce IV vasopressor duration and ICU length of stay, but the certainty is low and heterogeneity across trials is substantial; I need to ensure its use is protocolized and monitored for bradycardia and ischemia, and avoid substituting it for definitive hemodynamic optimization [^116Fi2TV].

> In summary, I need to ensure that bedside algorithms reflect this evidence: start norepinephrine and titrate to a MAP near 65 mmHg, add vasopressin rather than escalating norepinephrine indefinitely if MAP is inadequate, consider epinephrine when additional inopressor effect is needed while interpreting lactate with caution, reserve phenylephrine for selected phenotypes and avoid early substitution, and consider angiotensin II for refractory vasoplegia, all while minimizing overall vasopressor exposure, using central access when feasible, permitting carefully monitored peripheral infusions when necessary, and integrating dose with perfusion endpoints rather than using dose alone to drive decisions [^112dBiCH] [^1126s6cY] [^112pNbmR] [^111aqrXk] [^1113yHrZ] [^111DdU68] [^11518pmj] [^113RtDeo].

The following table summarizes the key vasopressors, their dosing, and clinical considerations. Norepinephrine is **first-line** [^112dBiCH] for septic and vasodilatory shock, with **vasopressin as an adjunct** [^1126s6cY] when MAP remains inadequate. Epinephrine is reserved for **refractory shock [^112pNbmR] or cardiac arrest** [^117PE8vw], while phenylephrine is used when tachyarrhythmias limit other agents. Dopamine is now **rarely used due to arrhythmias** [^116Y4EwT], and angiotensin II may be considered in refractory vasodilatory shock [^111aqrXk]. Dosing should be titrated to **MAP targets** [^115ne9XC] and patient response, with close monitoring for adverse effects.

| **Vasopressor** | **Mechanism** | **Initial dose** | **Titration** | **Max dose** | **Clinical considerations** |
|-|-|-|-|-|-|
| Norepinephrine | α1, β1 agonist | 0.01–0.05 µg/kg/min | Titrate to MAP ≥ 65 mmHg | 0.3 µg/kg/min | First-line in septic/vasodilatory shock [^112dBiCH]; less arrhythmia than dopamine [^116Y4EwT] [^111QKcsh] |
| Epinephrine | α1, β1, β2 agonist | 0.01–0.05 µg/kg/min | Titrate to MAP ≥ 65 mmHg | 0.3 µg/kg/min | Refractory shock [^112pNbmR] or cardiac arrest [^117PE8vw]; increases lactate, arrhythmias [^112pNbmR] |
| Vasopressin | V1 receptor agonist | 0.03 units/min | Fixed dose | 0.04 units/min | Adjunct to norepinephrine [^1126s6cY]; catecholamine-sparing |
| Phenylephrine | α1 agonist | 0.5–2 µg/kg/min | Titrate to MAP ≥ 65 mmHg | 5 µg/kg/min | Use when tachyarrhythmias limit other agents; risk of bradycardia |
| Dopamine | Dose-dependent α, β, DA agonist | 5–10 µg/kg/min | Titrate to MAP ≥ 65 mmHg | 20 µg/kg/min | Rarely used [^111QKcsh]; high arrhythmia risk [^116Y4EwT] |
| Angiotensin II | AT1 receptor agonist | 20 ng/kg/min | Titrate to MAP ≥ 65 mmHg | 80 ng/kg/min | Refractory vasodilatory shock [^111aqrXk]; thrombotic risk |

---

In summary, the **key points** are that **norepinephrine is first-line** for septic/vasodilatory shock [^112dBiCH]; vasopressin is an adjunct [^1126s6cY]; epinephrine is for refractory shock or cardiac arrest [^112pNbmR]; phenylephrine is used when tachyarrhythmias limit other agents [^notfound]; dopamine is rarely used [^116Y4EwT]; and angiotensin II is considered for refractory vasodilatory shock [^111aqrXk].

Although norepinephrine, vasopressin, and angiotensin II work through different pathways, there are multiple agents that can impact the sympathetic system via altering levels of alpha and beta selectivity. Depending on the clinical scenario, additional stimulation or alpha or beta receptors could have potentially beneficial or deleterious effects.

In this context, epinephrine is suggested as an additive agent to raise MAP and reduce the dose of norepinephrine in cases of refractory shock. Although it is effective in raising MAP, epinephrine is not recommended as a first-line agent since clinical trials demonstrate a lack of a mortality benefit, supported further by a meta-analysis of vasopressor trials. Of note, epinephrine may increase lactate production via its activity on skeletal beta-2 receptors, complicating the interpretation of lactate clearance and evaluating perfusion.

Phenylephrine represents a complementary vasopressor that could be used. Given its selective alpha-1 agonist activity, the pharmacology of phenylephrine may appear attractive in a high output hypotensive state; however, this agent has the potential to cause splanchnic vasoconstriction. Notably, in a recent analysis of the effects of a nationwide shortage of norepinephrine, phenylephrine was the most commonly substituted vasopressor and was associated with increased mortality. Although correlation is not equivalent to causation, this is not supportive of earlier usage of phenylephrine.

Further, dopamine works not only through dopamine receptors at lower doses but also signals through alpha receptors.

- **Rationale for choice of vasopressor**: Norepinephrine is the most commonly used vasopressor in patients with vasodilatory shock. A large RCT comparing dopamine to norepinephrine as the initial vasopressor in patients with shock found no difference in mortality between randomized groups. However, norepinephrine was associated with less tachycardia in the first hours and was superior regarding survival in cardiogenic shock patients. Additionally, there was a trend towards more RRT-free days through day 28 in the norepinephrine group.

	- Vasopressin or its analogue, terlipressin, may have a role in the treatment of norepinephrine-refractory shock. Exogenous vasopressin has vasoconstrictive and antidiuretic properties and may increase glomerular filtration by preferential post-glomerular vasoconstriction. In the largest RCT in septic shock (VASST trial), vasopressin reduced mortality in the subgroup with less severe shock, but not in the entire population. There were no differences in RRT-free days. However, in a secondary analysis, reduced progression to higher stages of AKI was demonstrated in the subgroup of patients with AKI stage 1 at baseline. In a subsequent 2 × 2 RCT involving 409 patients with early septic shock (VANISH trial), the use of vasopressin compared to norepinephrine did not affect the proportion of patients who never developed AKI stage 3 (57% vs. 59.2%), the number of AKI stage 3-free days [difference −4 (−11 to 5)], or the incidence of AKI stage 3 [difference −5.1% (−15.2 to 5.0)]. The use of vasopressin reduced the need for RRT [difference −9.9% (−19.3 to −0.6)], but…

### Management of refractory vasodilatory shock [^111aqrXk]. Chest (2018). Low credibility.

Refractory shock is a lethal manifestation of cardiovascular failure defined by an inadequate hemodynamic response to high doses of vasopressor medications. Approximately 7% of critically ill patients develop refractory shock, with short-term mortality exceeding 50%. Refractory vasodilatory shock develops from uncontrolled vasodilation and vascular hyporesponsiveness to endogenous vasoconstrictors, causing failure of physiologic vasoregulatory mechanisms.

Standard approaches to the initial management of shock include fluid resuscitation and the initiation of norepinephrine. When these measures are inadequate to restore blood pressure, vasopressin or epinephrine can be added. Few randomized studies exist to guide clinical management and hemodynamic stabilization in patients who do not respond to this standard approach. Adjunctive therapies, such as hydrocortisone, thiamine, and ascorbic acid, may increase blood pressure in severe shock and should be considered when combination vasopressor therapy is needed.

Novel vasopressor agents, such as synthetic human angiotensin II, can increase blood pressure and reduce the need for high doses of catecholamine vasopressors in severe or refractory vasodilatory shock. However, few effective rescue therapies exist for established refractory shock, which emphasizes the importance of aggressive intervention before refractory shock develops, including the earlier initiation of rational combination vasopressor therapy.

The present review discusses the diagnosis and management of refractory shock to offer guidance for managing this important clinical problem and provide a framework.

### State of shock: Contemporary vasopressor and inotrope use in cardiogenic shock [^114nWza7]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). High credibility.

Cardiogenic shock is characterized by tissue hypoxia caused by circulatory failure arising from inadequate cardiac output. In addition to treating the pathologic process causing impaired cardiac function, prompt hemodynamic support is essential to reduce the risk of developing multiorgan dysfunction and to preserve cellular metabolism. Pharmacologic therapy with the use of vasopressors and inotropes is a key component of this treatment strategy, improving perfusion by increasing cardiac output, altering systemic vascular resistance, or both, while allowing time and hemodynamic stability to treat the underlying disease process implicated in the development of cardiogenic shock. Despite the use of mechanical circulatory support recently garnering significant interest, pharmacologic hemodynamic support remains a cornerstone of cardiogenic shock management, with over 90% of patients receiving at least one vasoactive agent. This review aims to describe the pharmacology and hemodynamic effects of pharmacotherapies and provide a practical approach to their use, while highlighting important future research directions.

### Clinical practice parameters for hemodynamic support of pediatric and neonatal septic shock: 2007 update from the American College of Critical Care Medicine [^111opTr9]. Critical Care Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

The Institute of Medicine calls for the use of clinical guidelines and practice parameters to promote "best practices" and to improve patient outcomes.

- **Objective**: 2007 update of the 2002 American College of Critical Care Medicine clinical guidelines for hemodynamic support of neonates and children with septic shock.

- **Participants**: Society of Critical Care Medicine members with special interest in neonatal and pediatric septic shock were identified from general solicitation at the Society of Critical Care Medicine Educational and Scientific Symposia (2001–2006).

- **Methods**: The PubMed/MEDLINE literature database (1966–2006) was searched using the keywords and phrases: sepsis, septicemia, septic shock, endotoxemia, persistent pulmonary hypertension, nitric oxide, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), and American College of Critical Care Medicine guidelines. Best practice centers that reported best outcomes were identified and their practices examined as models of care. Using a modified Delphi method, 30 experts graded new literature. Over 30 additional experts then reviewed the updated recommendations. The document was subsequently modified until there was greater than 90% expert consensus.

- **Results**: The 2002 guidelines were widely disseminated, translated into Spanish and Portuguese, and incorporated into Society of Critical Care Medicine and AHA sanctioned recommendations. Centers that implemented the 2002 guidelines reported best practice outcomes (hospital mortality 1%-3% in previously healthy, and 7%-10% in chronically ill children).

### Lower versus higher exposure to vasopressor therapy in vasodilatory hypotension: A systematic review with meta-analysis [^11518pmj]. Critical Care Medicine (2023). High credibility.

In patients with vasodilatory hypotension who are started on vasopressors, moderate-certainty evidence from three randomized trials showed that lower vasopressor exposure probably lowers mortality. However, an additional large trial is needed to reach an optimal information size to detect a clinically important 10% relative reduction in mortality with this approach.

### Knowing the ropes of vasopressor dosing: A focus on norepinephrine [^1113yHrZ]. Intensive Care Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

Due to its short half-life (< 2.5 min), norepinephrine must be administered as a continuous infusion. Manufacturers recommend diluting norepinephrine in dextrose-containing solutions because of potential inactivation by oxidation in saline solutions. Usual adult preparation concentrations range from 16 mcg/mL to 128 mcg/mL. Recent data have highlighted the relative safety of short-term (< 48 h), low-dose (< 15 mcg/min) administration of norepinephrine diluted at 64 mcg/mL through peripheral intravenous access. Notwithstanding, administration through central venous access is still hegemonic and advisable in ICU practice.

There is significant worldwide variability in drug formulations. Norepinephrine can be found as tartrate, bitartrate, or hydrochloride salts, with different molecular weights and potency equivalence to norepinephrine base. Tartrate is the weakest formulation. Similarly, there is heterogeneity in practice on how to titrate the drug infusion, either using absolute values (i.e. mcg/min) or weighted values (i.e. mcg/kg/min). Since its dose is tailored to achieve a pharmacodynamic effect — blood pressure — it is titrated to meet clinical targets, regardless of formulation or dosing scheme. However, this heterogeneity could impact the interpretation and exchangeability of clinical data, the design and execution of research, and compliance with expert recommendations. Thus, homogenization and consensus should be sought.

Guidelines recommend titrating vasopressors to attain an initial MAP target of 65 mmHg.

### Effect of reduced exposure to vasopressors on 90-day mortality in older critically ill patients with vasodilatory hypotension: A randomized clinical trial [^115wZ7i6]. JAMA (2020). High credibility.

Vasopressors are commonly administered to intensive care unit (ICU) patients to raise blood pressure, balancing the risks and benefits of vasopressors is a challenge, particularly in older patients.

- **Objective**: To determine whether reducing exposure to vasopressors through permissive hypotension (mean arterial pressure [MAP] target, 60–65 mm Hg) reduces mortality at 90 days in ICU patients aged 65 years or older with vasodilatory hypotension.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: A multicenter, pragmatic, randomized clinical trial was conducted in 65 ICUs in the United Kingdom and included 2600 randomized patients aged 65 years or older with vasodilatory hypotension, as assessed by the treating clinician. The study was conducted from July 2017 to March 2019, and follow-up was completed in August 2019.

- **Interventions**: Patients were randomized 1:1 to vasopressors guided either by MAP target (60–65 mm Hg, permissive hypotension) (n = 1291) or according to usual care (at the discretion of treating clinicians) (n = 1307).

- **Main outcome and measures**: The primary clinical outcome was all-cause mortality at 90 days.

- **Results**: Of 2600 randomized patients, after removal of those who declined or had withdrawn consent, 2463 (95%) were included in the analysis of the primary outcome (mean [SD] age 75 years [7 years]; 1387 [57%] men). Patients randomized to the permissive hypotension group had lower exposure to vasopressors compared with those in the usual care group (median duration 33 hours vs. 38 hours; difference in medians, -5.0; 95% CI, -7.8 to -2.2 hours).

### The surviving sepsis campaign: Fluid resuscitation and vasopressor therapy research priorities in adult patients [^115qRmYj]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

- **Question 3: What is the optimal approach to selection, dose titration, and escalation of vasopressor therapy?** Mean arterial pressure (MAP) is determined, in part, by signaling through pharmacologically distinct families of receptors. Vasopressor agents are currently available that work by altering signaling via catecholamines, vasopressin receptors, and the renin/angiotensin system. Norepinephrine is recommended as a first-line vasopressor agent for the treatment of septic shock. A systematic review and meta-analysis of 11 randomized trials reported that norepinephrine use resulted in lower mortality (RR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.81–0.98) and decreased risk of arrhythmias (RR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.40–0.58) compared with dopamine. Survey studies of intensivists reflect preferences for norepinephrine as the first-line vasopressor agent, indicating clinician agreement with guideline recommendations.

	- In studies of vasopressin as both an adjunctive treatment and as a first-line therapy, results have been mixed. Although vasopressin did not alter mortality when added to norepinephrine, a subset demonstrated a potential and unexpected survival benefit in patients with less severe septic shock (norepinephrine < 15 µg/min). However, a subsequent study failed to confirm any survival benefit with vasopressin therapy, although a reduced need for renal replacement therapy compared with norepinephrine was noted. A consistent norepinephrine-sparing effect has been observed with vasopressin in doses of 0.01–0.03 U/min, leading to its consideration as a viable adjunctive treatment in specific clinical scenarios.

### The surviving sepsis campaign: Fluid resuscitation and vasopressor therapy research priorities in adult patients [^115rZTMg]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

What is not known — gaps in our understanding — directs future research.

- **Personalization of vasopressor agent selection**: Should vasopressor agent selection be personalized based on patient characteristics, such as home medications and chronic disease conditions? A decisional process to individualize vasopressor therapies does not currently exist. Identifying patient-specific factors affecting organ perfusion and vasopressor response to adjust perfusion targets is not commonly used in clinical practice. There is recognition that underlying chronic disease states may affect organ perfusion. However, there is a lack of evidence to guide vasopressor selection based on patient-specific factors in the clinical setting.

- **Starting dose of norepinephrine**: What should the starting dose of norepinephrine be?

- **Appropriateness of norepinephrine as first-line choice**: Is norepinephrine always the appropriate choice as a first-line vasopressor in sepsis? The data surrounding this recommendation are relatively scant. Is there a potential benefit to using vasopressin as a first-line therapy in select patients with septic shock in the broader population or in a select group of patients, such as those with atrial fibrillation or chronic kidney disease?

- **Selection of the second-line agent**: Which agent should be considered second-line therapy, and does this change based on patient characteristics?

- **Thresholds for adding a second vasopressor agent**: What are appropriate thresholds for adding a second vasopressor agent? Trials comparing adjunctive vasopressor strategies have evaluated different endpoints. Whether adding adjunctive therapies to norepinephrine improves safety and survival is largely unknown. Meaningful clinical endpoints aside from survival may potentially include, but are not limited to, other factors.

### Practice patterns and outcomes associated with choice of initial vasopressor therapy for septic shock [^115kDfxk]. Critical Care Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Clinical guidelines recommend norepinephrine as the initial vasopressor of choice for septic shock, with dopamine suggested as an alternative in selected patients with low risk of tachyarrhythmias and either absolute or relative bradycardia. We aimed to determine practice patterns and outcomes associated with vasopressor selection in a large, population-based cohort of patients with septic shock, enabling assessment of outcomes in clinically important subgroups.

We performed a retrospective cohort study to investigate factors associated with the choice of dopamine compared to norepinephrine as the initial vasopressor for patients with septic shock. Using propensity score matching, we compared the risk of hospital mortality based on initial vasopressor. Multiple sensitivity analyses were conducted using alternative methods to address confounding and hospital-level clustering. We explored the interaction between vasopressor selection and mortality in clinical subgroups based on arrhythmia and cardiovascular risk.

Our study utilized enhanced administrative data from 502 U.S. hospitals (Premier, Charlotte, NC) during the years 2010–2013, involving a total of 61,122 patients admitted with septic shock who received either dopamine or norepinephrine as the initial vasopressor during the first two days of hospitalization.

There were no interventions. Norepinephrine (77.6%) was the most frequently used initial vasopressor during septic shock. Dopamine was preferentially selected by cardiologists, particularly in the Southern United States, at non-teaching hospitals, and for older patients.

### Prevention of acute kidney injury and protection of renal function in the intensive care unit. Expert opinion of the Working Group for Nephrology, ESICM [^111XpMhh]. Intensive Care Medicine (2010). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for acute kidney injury, particularly in the context of the ICU, ESICM 2010 guidelines recommend administering either norepinephrine or dopamine (along with fluid resuscitation) as the first-choice vasopressor. This is to correct hypotension in patients experiencing vasoplegic hypotension due to sepsis or systemic inflammatory response syndrome.

### State of shock: Contemporary vasopressor and inotrope use in cardiogenic shock [^114S5hKj]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). High credibility.

Use of vasoactive medications in clinical practice

Use of vasoactive medications in cardiogenic shock (CS) is common. In the intensive care unit (ICU) setting, approximately 25% of admitted patients receive at least one vasoactive medication. This percentage increases to over 90% in patients with CS. Although comparative studies assessing these agents are limited, norepinephrine is increasingly administered to patients requiring hemodynamic support with CS. The requirement for vasoactive medications is independently associated with short‐term mortality, and a stepwise increase in the risk of in‐hospital mortality has been observed with an increasing number of vasoactive agents administered.

Furthermore, a dose‐dependent relationship with higher required peak doses to achieve hemodynamic stability is also associated with an increased risk of death. Although the observed excess mortality risk associated with the use of this drug class is concerning, these findings are likely confounded by increased illness severity necessitating the use of multiple agents at high doses. Nonetheless, these data underscore the need for further evaluation of the utility of these commonly used medications, compared with alternate vasoactive sparing strategies such as mechanical circulatory support (MCS).

Regarding medical management for COVID-19 infection, particularly concerning intravenous vasopressors, SCCM 2021 guidelines recommend considering the addition of vasopressin as a second-line vasoactive agent rather than titrating the norepinephrine dose. This recommendation applies to adult patients with COVID-19 and shock if the target mean arterial pressure cannot be achieved with norepinephrine alone.

### State of shock: Contemporary vasopressor and inotrope use in cardiogenic shock [^115JDtMB]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). High credibility.

The treatment of refractory hypotension in cardiogenic shock represents a significant challenge. In the setting of severe metabolic acidosis, which occurs due to tissue hypoxia and subsequent activation of anaerobic metabolic pathways, both in vivo and ex vivo experimental data have demonstrated reduced vascular and cardiac responsiveness to catecholamines. The relatively preserved vasopressor effects in the setting of acidosis of vasopressin and methylene blue render these drugs a reasonable choice to trial as salvage therapy in cases of catecholamine-refractory vasoplegia.

### Hitting the vasopressor ceiling: Finding norepinephrine associated mortality in the critically ill [^114yuCzV]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2021). Low credibility.

There is no consensus on what dose of norepinephrine corresponds with futility. The purpose of this study was to investigate the maximum infusion and cumulative doses of norepinephrine associated with survival for patients in medical and surgical intensive care units (MICU and SICU).

- **Materials and methods**: A retrospective review was conducted of 661 critically ill patients admitted to a large academic medical center who received norepinephrine. Univariate, multivariate, and area under the curve analyses with optimal cutoffs for maximum infusion rate and cumulative dosage were determined by the Youden Index.

- **Results**: The population was 54.9% male, 75.8% white, and 58.7 ± 16.1 years old, with 384 (69.8%) admitted to the MICU and 166 (30.2%) admitted to the SICU, including 38 trauma patients. Inflection points in mortality were seen at 18 mcg/min and 17.6 mg. The inflection point was higher in MICU patients at 21 mcg/min and lower in SICU patients at 11 mcg/min. MICU patients also had a higher maximum cumulative dosage of 30.7 mg, compared to 2.7 mg in SICU patients. In trauma patients, norepinephrine infusions up to 5 mcg/min were associated with a 41.7% mortality rate.

- **Conclusion**: A maximum rate of 18 mcg/min and cumulative dose of 17.6 mg were the inflection points for mortality risk in ICU patients, with SICU patients tolerating lower doses. In trauma patients, even low doses of norepinephrine were associated with higher mortality. These data suggest that MICU, SICU, and trauma patients differ in need for, response to, and outcome from escalating norepinephrine dose.

### Vasopressor therapy in critically ill patients with shock [^114hkDpJ]. Intensive Care Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Vasopressors are administered to critically ill patients with vasodilatory shock not responsive to volume resuscitation and less often in cardiogenic and hypovolemic shock.

- **Objectives**: The objectives are to review the safety and efficacy of vasopressors, their pathophysiology, agents that decrease vasopressor dose, predictive biomarkers, β1-blockers, and directions for research.

- **Methods**: The quality of evidence was evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system.

- **Results**: Vasopressors bind to adrenergic receptors (α1, α2, β1, β2); vasopressin receptors (AVPR1a, AVPR1B, AVPR2); angiotensin II receptors (AG1, AG2); and dopamine receptors (DA1, DA2), inducing vasoconstriction. Vasopressor choice and dose vary due to patient condition and physician practice. Adverse effects include excessive vasoconstriction, organ ischemia, hyperglycemia, hyperlactatemia, tachycardia, and tachyarrhythmias. No randomized controlled trials of vasopressors showed a significant difference in 28-day mortality rates. Norepinephrine is the first-choice vasopressor in vasodilatory shock after adequate volume resuscitation. Some strategies, such as vasopressin and angiotensin II, decrease norepinephrine dose but have not reduced 28-day mortality, whereas corticosteroids have decreased 28-day mortality significantly in some, but not all, trials (two large trials). In norepinephrine-refractory patients, vasopressin or epinephrine may be added. A new vasopressor, angiotensin II, may be useful in profoundly hypotensive patients. Dobutamine may be added because vasopressors may decrease ventricular contraction.

### The management of cardiogenic shock from diagnosis to devices: A narrative review [^116axTfw]. CHEST Critical Care (2024). High credibility.

Early use of vasoactive agents is recommended to optimize perfusion in CS. These agents are of four varieties: vasopressors, inopressors, inodilators, and vasodilators. Nearly all of these medications contribute to increased myocardial oxygen consumption and may provoke atrial or ventricular arrhythmias, which can be detrimental in CS. Thus, although the value of these medications cannot be overstated in the acute management of CS, their use ideally should be limited to the lowest doses necessary and for the shortest duration possible.

Inopressors are the preferred first-line agents in hypotensive patients because they increase MAP and provide inotropic support. Several expert consensus documents recommend norepinephrine as the initial agent of choice. A subgroup analysis of patients with CS enrolled in the Sepsis Occurrence in Acutely Ill Patients (SOAP) II trial showed that norepinephrine was associated with lower rates of death and arrhythmia in CS than dopamine. However, no singular approach exists, and often norepinephrine is used concurrently with the inodilator dobutamine for a greater β-agonist effect, or epinephrine can be used as monotherapy.

It should be noted that in a small randomized trial comparing norepinephrine with epinephrine in AMI-CS, norepinephrine use was associated with lower rates of refractory shock, lower lactate levels, and less tachycardia than epinephrine. However, these findings are controversial, and at low doses, epinephrine represents a reasonable, primarily inotropic, agent that may be highly effective and has been used widely in practice.

### Vasopressor Use, Critical Care Management, and Outcomes in Dihydropyridine Calcium Channel Blocker Toxicity [^112kY4ZB]. Journal of medical toxicology (2025). Low credibility.

Although dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (DHP CCBs) are considered to have less direct myocardial toxicity than non-dihydropyridines, DHPs remain a common cause of morbidity and mortality. We sought to examine various indices of critical illness and describe the clinical course of a population of DHP CCB-poisoned patients with special attention to vasopressor dosing and ischemic complications.

Methods

This is a retrospective chart review of DHP CCB exposures admitted to a single center. The study site was a single tertiary referral center with an in-house medical toxicology consultation/admitting service. Inclusion criteria included age ≥ 14 years and DHP ingestion noted on departmental patient log. Patients were excluded if DHP exposure was not documented in the medical record. The study period ranged from July 1, 2010 through December 31, 2022. Data on clinical presentation, management, and outcomes were reported.

Results

Sixty-eight cases of DHP exposure were analyzed; 87% were intentional ingestions. Amlodipine represented 88% of cases. 85% included cases involved co-ingestions. Vasopressors were administered in 42 cases (62%), with a median of three agents (IQR 1–4). Norepinephrine was most common (N = 41; 98%), followed by epinephrine (N = 23; 55%); median maximal rates were 45.0 (IQR 13.5–70.0) and 25.0 (IQR 12.0–30.0) mcg/min, respectively. 15% (N = 10) received high dose insulin-euglycemic therapy (HIE); all had > 2 vasopressors administered before administration of HIE. Twelve (18%) patients had ischemic complications; five (7%) experienced ischem

Use of vasoactive medications in cardiogenic shock (CS) is common and forms the cornerstone of the contemporary hemodynamic support strategy for these patients. We have sought to present the unique pharmacology of these medications and provide a pragmatic approach to their use. However, despite the ubiquitous use of these agents in critical care settings, there remains a lack of robust, outcomes-based data, underscoring the need for further high-quality trials to guide future practice.

### Knowing the ropes of vasopressor dosing: A focus on norepinephrine [^115p4xNp]. Intensive Care Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

Norepinephrine peak or accumulated dose, often referred to as catecholamine burden, has been utilized as a bedside proxy for clinical severity. It is incorporated into clinical scoring systems, such as the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score, and has been linked with organ dysfunction and mortality. Norepinephrine dose thresholds have been suggested as triggers for the initiation of other therapies, like vasopressin or steroids. However, clinicians should consider integrating norepinephrine dosing with additional variables, such as tissue perfusion and organ dysfunction, rather than relying solely on a single parameter in complex decision-making scenarios. Multiple factors, including sedative choice and dosing, mechanical ventilation, or homeostatic derangements, could negatively impact vasopressor requirements.

### Intra-abdominal infections survival guide: A position statement by the Global Alliance for Infections in Surgery [^111rgkqh]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2024). Low credibility.

- **Statement 19**: Vasopressor agents should be administered to restore organ perfusion as soon as possible if blood pressure is not restored after initial fluid resuscitation (low-quality evidence, strong recommendation).

If fluid resuscitation fails or is protracted, vasopressor agents should be administered to restore organ perfusion, maintaining but usually not exceeding the aforementioned target for mean arterial pressure (mAP). The initial vasopressor of choice is norepinephrine, which has a beta-agonist effect at low doses but increasingly becomes an alpha-agonist at escalating doses. Although most patients in shock show improvement in hemodynamics after starting norepinephrine, a proportion of patients remain with a poor clinical response to catecholamines, such as requiring large doses (> 0.5 mcg/Kg/min of norepinephrine) to achieve an mAP of 65 mm Hg, if the threshold is reached at all. In refractory cases, adding a second vasopressor may be advantageous rather than further increasing the norepinephrine dose. Low-dose arginine vasopressin (0.03–0.06 IU/min by continuous infusion) has a "catecholamine-sparing" effect and also reduces mortality.

- **Statement 20**: Fluid overload should be avoided in adults with sepsis or septic shock of abdominal origin (very low-quality evidence, strong recommendation).

To avoid an adverse outcome, fluid overload should be avoided in adults with sepsis or septic shock of abdominal origin for several reasons. Overly aggressive fluid resuscitation, particularly for patients requiring urgent surgical intervention, may increase intra-abdominal pressure and heighten the risk of complications.

### Vasopressor therapy in cardiac surgery-an experts' consensus statement [^11676HM7]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2021). Low credibility.

Hemodynamic conditions with reduced systemic vascular resistance are commonly observed in patients undergoing cardiac surgery and may range from moderate reductions in vascular tone, as a side effect of general anesthetics, to a profound vasodilatory syndrome, often referred to as vasoplegic shock. Therapy with vasopressors is an important pillar in the treatment of these conditions. There is limited guidance on the appropriate choice of vasopressors to restore and optimize systemic vascular tone in patients undergoing cardiac surgery.

A panel of experts in the field convened to develop statements and evidence-based recommendations on clinically relevant questions regarding the use of vasopressors in cardiac surgical patients. They used a critical appraisal of the literature following the GRADE system and a modified Delphi process. The authors unanimously and strongly recommend the use of norepinephrine and/or vasopressin for the restoration and maintenance of systemic perfusion pressure in cardiac surgical patients; however, they cannot recommend either of these drugs considering the risk of ischemic complications.

- **Strong recommendations**:
	- The authors unanimously and strongly recommend against using dopamine for treating post-cardiac surgery vasoplegic shock. They also strongly recommend against using methylene blue for purposes other than as a rescue therapy.

- **Weak recommendations**:
	- The authors weakly recommend that clinicians consider the early addition of a second vasopressor (norepinephrine or vasopressin) if adequate vascular tone cannot be restored by monotherapy with either norepinephrine or vasopressin.

### Prevention of acute kidney injury and protection of renal function in the intensive care unit: Update 2017: Expert opinion of the working group on prevention, AKI section, European Society of Intensive Care Medicine [^116M1KhU]. Intensive Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

- **Vasopressors**: We recommend titrating vasopressors to a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 65–70 mmHg (Grade 1B) rather than a higher MAP target (80–85 mmHg) in patients with septic shock. However, for patients with chronic hypertension, we recommend aiming for a higher target (80–85 mmHg) for renal protection in septic shock (Grade 1C). We recommend lowering systolic pressure to 140–190 mmHg rather than to 110–139 mmHg in patients with acute cerebral hemorrhage with severe admission hypertension (Grade 1C). If vasopressors are needed for the treatment of hypotension, we recommend norepinephrine (along with correction of hypovolemia) as the first-choice vasopressor to protect kidney function (Grade 1B) and suggest vasopressin in patients with vasoplegic shock after cardiac surgery (Grade 2C). We suggest individualizing target pressure when premorbid blood pressure is available (BPS).

- **Rationale for MAP target**: Preservation or improvement of renal perfusion can theoretically be achieved through increasing cardiac output by fluid resuscitation or inotropic drugs, through renal vasodilators or systemic vasopressors. Optimal target mean arterial pressure (MAP) was studied in a large open-label multicenter RCT randomizing 777 patients with septic shock to resuscitation with a MAP target of either 80–85 mmHg or 65–70 mmHg. In most of the patients, the achieved MAP was above the set target. The study found no difference in mortality, incidence of AKI stage 2 (38.7% vs. 41.5%, p = 0.42) or need for RRT (33.5% vs. 35.8%, p = 0.5), but more atrial fibrillation in the high target group.

### A time-sensitive analysis of the prognostic utility of vasopressor dose in septic shock [^117RDqQF]. Anaesthesia (2021). Low credibility.

The study investigated whether the relationship between vasopressor dose and mortality is influenced by the duration of administration in septic shock patients. Researchers explored the feasibility of prognostication in septic shock through daily median vasopressor doses. A single-centre retrospective cohort study was conducted, including patients diagnosed with septic shock admitted to the intensive care unit at Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Birmingham, UK, between April 2016 and July 2019.

The primary outcome measure was 90-day mortality. Vasopressor dose was defined as the median norepinephrine equivalent dose (equivalent infusion rates of all vasopressors and inotropes) recorded for each day during the first four days of septic shock. Patients were categorized into groups by vasopressor dose quintiles to calculate their 90-day mortality rate. The area under the receiver operator characteristic curves was examined for prognostic ability.

In total, 844 patients were admitted with septic shock, resulting in a 90-day mortality rate of 43% (n = 358). Over the first four days, the median vasopressor dose decreased in 93% of survivors and increased in 56% of non-survivors. The mortality rate associated with a specific vasopressor dose quintile increased on sequential days of septic shock. The area under the receiver operator characteristic curves of daily median vasopressor dose against mortality increased from day 1 to day 4 (0.67 vs. 0.86). A vasopressor dose greater than 0.05 μg/kg/min had an 80% sensitivity and specificity for mortality. The prognostic utility of vasopressor dose improved considerably with time.

### Early vasopressor utilization strategies and outcomes in critically ill patients with severe traumatic brain injury [^113YDf3t]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2022). Low credibility.

Early hypotension after severe traumatic brain injury (sTBI) is associated with increased mortality and poor long-term outcomes. Guidelines suggest the use of intravenous vasopressors, commonly norepinephrine and phenylephrine, to support blood pressure after TBI. However, guidelines do not specify vasopressor type, resulting in variation in clinical practice. We describe early vasopressor utilization patterns in critically ill patients with TBI and examine the association between utilization of norepinephrine, compared to phenylephrine, with hospital mortality after sTBI.

- **Methods**: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of US hospitals participating in the Premier Healthcare Database between 2009 and 2018. We examined adult patients (> 17 years of age) with a primary diagnosis of sTBI who were treated in an intensive care unit (ICU) after injury. The primary exposure was vasopressor choice (phenylephrine versus norepinephrine) within the first 2 days of hospital admission. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes examined included hospital length of stay (LOS) and ICU LOS. We conducted a post hoc subgroup analysis in all patients with intracranial pressure (ICP) monitor placement. Regression analysis was used to assess differences in outcomes between patients exposed to phenylephrine versus norepinephrine, with propensity matching to address selection bias due to the nonrandom allocation of treatment groups.

- **Results**: From 2009 to 2018, 24,718 (37.1%) of 66,610 sTBI patients received vasopressors within the first 2 days of hospital admission.

### Vasopressors for shock [^113t7xFz]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

The primary treatment for shock symptoms, beyond addressing the root cause, typically involves the administration of intravenous fluids. If this approach is unsuccessful, the recommendation is to use vasopressors, such as dopamine, dobutamine, adrenaline, noradrenaline, and vasopressin. Currently, there is no clear preference for a specific vasopressor in treating particular forms of shock or shock in general.

- **Objectives**: This review aimed to assess the efficacy of vasopressors in treating circulatory shock in critically ill patients. The primary focus was to determine whether specific vasopressors could reduce overall mortality. Additionally, the review sought to evaluate if the choice of vasopressor affects outcomes such as the length of stay in the intensive care unit and health-related quality of life.

- **Search strategy**: The research utilized databases including MEDLINE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, EMBASE, PASCAL BioMed, CINAHL, BIOSIS, and PsychINFO, covering records from inception to November 2003, to identify randomized controlled trials. Experts in the field were also consulted, and meta-registries were searched for ongoing trials.

- **Selection criteria**: The review included randomized controlled trials that compared various vasopressors, vasopressors with placebo, or vasopressors with intravenous fluids for treating any form of circulatory failure (shock). The primary outcome assessed was mortality.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Data were independently abstracted by two reviewers. In cases of disagreement, a third reviewer facilitated resolution. Quantitative data were combined using random effects models.

### Safety considerations and guideline-based safe use recommendations for "bolus-dose" vasopressors in the emergency department [^11487Lvg]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Use of intermittently administered doses of vasopressors to correct hypotension in the emergency department (ED), commonly referred to as bolus-dose pressors, push-dose pressors, Neo-sticks, or phenyl sticks, has been widely advocated outside of the traditional printed medical literature. No outcomes data of this practice exist to demonstrate benefits over traditional continuous infusion of vasopressors. The use of bolus-dose vasopressors in the ED setting raises a number of patient safety concerns, and misuse and errors in the preparation and administration of bolus-dose vasopressors may result in patient harm.

A systems-based approach should be implemented to maximize safety and patient benefits if bolus-dose vasopressors are used. This article discusses the wide range of issues to consider when evaluating the role of bolus-dose vasopressors in the ED and provides recommendations based on safe medication practices guidelines.

### State of shock: Contemporary vasopressor and inotrope use in cardiogenic shock [^112ujwK7]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). High credibility.

The study of the physiologic properties of vasoactive medications dates back to 1893, when the English physician George Oliver assessed the effects of various glandular extracts derived from sheep on radial artery vasoreactivity in his son. Evolving from these early experiments, the contemporary conceptual framework for these agents was established and is broadly divided into three categories in accordance with their predominant hemodynamic effects: vasopressors, inotropes, and inodilators.

- **Vasopressors**: Improve perfusion to vital organs by increasing systemic vascular resistance and therefore mean arterial pressure (MAP).

- **Inotropes**: Augment cardiac output by increasing myocardial contractility and in many instances heart rate.

- **Inodilators**: Have the unique mixed effects of inotropy and arterial vasodilation.

A summary of the commonly used vasoactive agents is presented in Table 1.

Table 1
Common Vasoactive Medications, Indication for Clinical Use, Adverse Effects, and Receptor Affinity

Conventional descriptions of the agonist-receptor-effector interactions promulgated in traditional pharmacology teaching are primarily based on small studies from the 1950s to 1960s, using variable drug doses and indirect surrogate measurements of in-vivo receptor activity and downstream effects. In these early mechanistic studies, the observed physiologic effects of catecholamine administration in healthy subjects on blood pressure, total peripheral resistance, and heart rate were used to evaluate drug efficacy and safety.

### Reversal of vasodilatory shock: Current perspectives on conventional, rescue, and emerging vasoactive agents for the treatment of shock [^114Pq9im]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2020). Low credibility.

Understanding the different mechanisms of vasoconstrictors is crucial to their optimal application to clinically diverse shock states. We present a comprehensive review of conventional, rescue, and novel vasoactive agents, including their pharmacology and evidence supporting their use in vasodilatory shock. The role of each drug in relation to the Surviving Sepsis Guidelines is discussed to provide a context of how each one fits into the algorithm for treating vasodilatory shock.

- **Rescue agents**: Can be utilized when conventional medications fail, although there are varying levels of evidence on their clinical effectiveness.
- **Novel agents**: For the treatment of vasodilatory shock have recently emerged, such as ascorbic acid and angiotensin II. Ascorbic acid has been used with some success in vasoplegia and is currently undergoing a more rigorous evaluation of its utility. Angiotensin II (Ang-2) is the newest available vasopressor for the treatment of vasodilatory shock. In addition to its catecholamine-sparing properties, it has been shown to hold promising mortality benefits in certain subsets of critically ill patients.

### Comparison of dopamine and norepinephrine in the treatment of shock [^116Y4EwT]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2010). High credibility.

Both dopamine and norepinephrine are recommended as first-line vasopressor agents in the treatment of shock. There is a continuing controversy about whether one agent is superior to the other.

- **Methods**: In this multicenter, randomized trial, we assigned patients with shock to receive either dopamine or norepinephrine as first-line vasopressor therapy to restore and maintain blood pressure. When blood pressure could not be maintained with a dose of 20 microg per kilogram of body weight per minute for dopamine or a dose of 0.19 microg per kilogram per minute for norepinephrine, open-label norepinephrine, epinephrine, or vasopressin could be added. The primary outcome was the rate of death at 28 days after randomization; secondary endpoints included the number of days without the need for organ support and the occurrence of adverse events.

- **Results**: The trial included 1679 patients, of whom 858 were assigned to dopamine and 821 to norepinephrine. The baseline characteristics of the groups were similar. There was no significant between-group difference in the rate of death at 28 days (52.5% in the dopamine group and 48.5% in the norepinephrine group; odds ratio with dopamine, 1.17; 95% confidence interval, 0.97 to 1.42; P = 0.10). However, there were more arrhythmic events among the patients treated with dopamine than among those treated with norepinephrine (207 events [24.1%] vs. 102 events [12.4%], P < 0.001). A subgroup analysis showed that dopamine, as compared with norepinephrine, was associated with an increased rate of death at 28 days among the 280 patients with ca

### The evolution of mean arterial pressure in critically ill patients on vasopressors before and during a trial comparing a specific mean arterial pressure target to usual care [^1119tRiU]. BMC Anesthesiology (2022). Low credibility.

- **Mean MAP and vasopressor use among periods and groups**: Mean MAP while receiving vasopressors was 72.5 (5.1) in the pre-trial period vs. 72.4 (5.0) mmHg in the during-trial period (p = 0.76). Figure 2 shows the overall mean MAP while receiving vasopressors by month relative to trial initiation across all sites. The mean prescribed target MAP (mean, pre-trial period: 64.7 [3.1] vs. during-trial period: 65.3 [3.7] mmHg; p = 0.08), duration of vasopressor therapy (mean, pre-trial period: 48.5 [44.3] vs. during-trial period: 43.6 [40.5] hours; p = 0.24), and total vasopressor dose (mean, pre-trial period: 60.1 [122] vs. during-trial period: 56.6 [104.9] mg norepinephrine equivalents; p = 0.75) were similar between periods. Comparing between three groups, no difference was found in mean MAP while receiving vasopressors (mean, pre-trial group: 72.5 [5.1] vs. non-enrolled group: 72.3 [5.1] vs. usual care control group: 72.5 [4.9] mmHg; p = 0.92).

### Reconsidering vasopressors for cardiogenic shock: Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler [^114YnAeg]. Chest (2019). Low credibility.

Scientific statements and publications have recommended the use of vasoconstrictors as the first-line pharmacologic choice for most cases of cardiogenic shock (CS) without an abundance of strong clinical evidence. One challenge of guidelines is that the way recommendations are stated can potentially lead to oversimplification of complex situations. Except for acute coronary syndrome with CS, where maintenance of coronary perfusion pressure seems logical prior to revascularization, the physiological consequences of increasing afterload by use of vasoconstrictors should be analyzed.

Changing the CS conceptual frame, emphasizing inflammation and other vasodilating consequences of prolonged CS, mixes causes and consequences. Moreover, the considerable interpatient differences regarding the initial cause of CS and subsequent effects on both macro- and microcirculation argue for a dynamic, step-by-step, personalized therapeutic strategy. In CS, vasoconstrictors should be used only following a reasoning process and a review of other possible options. They should then be titrated to reach a reasonable pressure target while checking cardiac output and organ perfusion.

### Feasibility of closed-loop titration of norepinephrine infusion in patients undergoing moderate- and high-risk surgery [^115Ct7iJ]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2019). Low credibility.

Vasopressor agents are used to prevent intraoperative hypotension and ensure adequate perfusion. Traditionally, vasopressors are administered as intermittent boluses or manually adjusted infusions, which require considerable time and attention. We have developed a closed-loop vasopressor (CLV) controller to correct hypotension more efficiently. We conducted a proof-of-concept study to assess the feasibility and performance of CLV control in surgical patients.

- **Methods**: Twenty patients scheduled for elective surgical procedures were included in this study. The goal of the CLV system was to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) within 5 mm Hg of the target MAP by automatically adjusting the rate of a norepinephrine infusion, using MAP values recorded continuously from an arterial catheter. The primary outcome was the percentage of time that patients were hypotensive, defined by a MAP of 5 mm Hg below the chosen target. Secondary outcomes included the total dose of norepinephrine, the percentage of time with hypertension (MAP > 5 mm Hg above the chosen target), raw percentage "time in target", and Varvel performance criteria.

- **Results**: The 20 subjects (median age: 64 years [52–71]), with 35% male, underwent elective surgery lasting 154 minutes [124–233]. CLV control maintained MAP within ± 5 mm Hg of the target for 91.6% (85.6–93.3) of the intraoperative period. Subjects were hypotensive for 2.6% of the intraoperative period (range, 0–8.4%). Additional performance criteria for the controller included the mean absolute performance error of 2.9 (0.8) and mean predictive error of 0.5 (1.0). No subject…

### Lower versus higher exposure to vasopressor therapy in vasodilatory hypotension: A systematic review with meta-analysis [^111JTxdt]. Critical Care Medicine (2023). High credibility.

- **Sensitivity analyses**: We planned three sensitivity analyses: 1) excluding studies published as abstracts; 2) using within-study adjusted estimates of effect, where available, rather than crude estimates of effect (for the primary outcome); and 3) evaluating the impact of loss to follow-up for 28 and 90-day mortality across studies. The latter process consisted of repeating the analyses under the following assumptions: 1) all patients lost to follow-up in the control group survived while all missing patients in the experimental group died; 2) all patients lost to follow-up in the control group died while all missing patients in the experimental group survived; and 3) patients lost to follow-up in the experimental arm had the same risk of death as other patients in the experimental arm and patients lost to follow-up in the control arm had the same risk of death as other patients in the control arm.

- **Publication bias**: We planned to evaluate the risk of publication bias graphically and statistically for each outcome if at least 10 studies were included in the meta-analysis.

- **Certainty assessment**: Teams of two independent reviewers used the GRADE framework to report the overall certainty of evidence, as it relates to our confidence in estimates of effect. These recommendations consider the overall risk of bias, imprecision, inconsistency, indirectness, and, when possible, likelihood of publication bias to judge the overall certainty of the evidence across studies for each individual outcome. The certainty of evidence is classified as being very low, low, moderate, or high.

### Living guidance for clinical management of COVID-19 [^111DdU68]. who living guidance (2023). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for COVID-19 infection, specifically concerning intravenous vasopressors, WHO 2023 guidelines recommend considering the administration of vasopressors through a peripheral IV route if central venous catheters are unavailable. It is advised to use a large vein and closely monitor for signs of extravasation and local tissue necrosis. Stop the infusion if extravasation occurs. Additionally, consider administering vasopressors through intraosseous needles.

### Adjunctive midodrine therapy for vasopressor-dependent shock in the ICU: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^116Fi2TV]. Critical Care Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

To summarize the efficacy of midodrine as an adjunctive therapy in critically ill patients, the safety of midodrine was assessed as a secondary outcome.

- **Data sources**: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis using a peer-reviewed search strategy combining the themes of vasopressor-dependent shock, critical care, and midodrine. The databases included were MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, CINAHL, and Cochrane Library, covering up until September 14, 2023.

- **Study selection**: We included studies if they 1) included patients with vasopressor-dependent shock, 2) were performed in the ICU, 3) evaluated oral midodrine therapy compared with placebo or usual care, and 4) evaluated one of the outcomes of interest.

- **Data extraction**: We extracted data independently in duplicate using standardized data abstraction forms. These forms included variables such as patient characteristics, age, sex, type of ICU, etiology of shock, number of patients, study inclusion and exclusion criteria, and geographical location. We also captured the type, dose, and duration of IV vasopressors, any cointerventions used, and outcome data.

- **Data synthesis**: We identified seven randomized controlled trials (six included in the pooled analysis) and ten observational studies (four included in the pooled analysis) that met eligibility criteria. Adjunctive midodrine may decrease ICU length of stay (LOS), and there is low certainty of effect on hospital LOS. Midodrine may decrease IV vasopressor support duration, ICU mortality, and hospital mortality. Pooled observational data was based on very low certainty data.

### A global perspective on vasoactive agents in shock [^111mCpqr]. Intensive Care Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

We set out to summarize the knowledge on vasoactive drugs and their use in the management of shock to inform physicians' practices.

This is a narrative review by a multidisciplinary, multinational panel — from six continents — of experts, including physicians, a pharmacist, trialists, and scientists.

Vasoactive drugs are an essential part of shock management. Catecholamines are the most commonly used vasoactive agents in the intensive care unit, and among them, norepinephrine is the first-line therapy in most clinical conditions. Inotropes are indicated when myocardial function is depressed, and dobutamine remains the first-line therapy. Vasoactive drugs have a narrow therapeutic spectrum and expose the patients to potentially lethal complications. Thus, these agents require precise therapeutic targets, close monitoring with titration to the minimal efficacious dose, and should be weaned as promptly as possible. Moreover, the use of vasoactive drugs in shock requires an individualized approach. Vasopressin and possibly angiotensin II may be useful owing to their norepinephrine-sparing effects.

### A clinical review of vasopressors in emergency medicine [^111TxQxg]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Vasopressor medications raise blood pressure through vasoconstriction and are essential in reversing the hypotension seen in many critically ill patients. Previously, vasopressor administration was largely limited to continuous infusions through central venous access.

- **Objectives of the review**: This review addresses the clinical use of vasopressors in various shock states, including practical considerations and innovations in vasopressor administration. The focus is on the clinical administration of vasopressors across a range of shock states, including hypovolemic, distributive, cardiogenic, and obstructive shock.

- **Discussion**: Criteria for starting vasopressors are not clearly defined, though early use may be beneficial. A number of physiologic factors affect the body's response to vasopressors, such as acidosis and adrenal insufficiency. Peripheral and push-dose administration of vasopressors are becoming more common. Distributive shock is characterized by inappropriate vasodilation, and vasopressors play a crucial role in maintaining adequate blood pressure. The use of vasopressors is more controversial in hypovolemic shock, as the preferred treatment is correction of the volume deficit. Evidence for vasopressors is limited in cardiogenic shock. For obstructive shock, vasopressors can temporize a patient's blood pressure until definitive therapy can reverse the underlying cause.

- **Conclusion**: Across the categories of shock states, norepinephrine has wide applicability and is a reasonable first-line agent for shock of uncertain etiology. Keeping a broad differential is essential in managing shock states.

### Precision automated critical care management: Closed-loop critical care for the treatment of distributive shock in a swine model of ischemia-reperfusion [^111ohFni]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2023). High credibility.

Closed-loop automated critical care (ACC) systems for vasopressor titration and crystalloid management can achieve goal-directed resuscitation endpoints with smaller, more frequent interventions while avoiding delays in interventions that are commonplace in conventional critical care. These strategies seek to minimize undesired consequences from the resuscitation itself and provide a more targeted approach to re-establishing homeostasis.

Currently, little research is dedicated to closed-loop ACC systems that automate multiple therapeutic components in parallel. The feasibility of ACC has been proposed by some, while others have focused on computational modeling of ACC systems, with the majority focusing on single therapeutic interventions and not parallel interventions. To that end, we refined our first-generation closed-loop heuristic-based critical care algorithm by incorporating multiple physiologic parameters vital to targeted resuscitation strategies. The first- and second-generation algorithms were implemented with our automated fluid and drug delivery platform, Precision Automated Critical Care Management (PACC-MAN), in a highly reproducible distributive shock model.

We hypothesized that an enhanced critical care algorithm with additional physiologic inputs would reduce crystalloid and vasopressor administration while achieving equivalent resuscitation endpoints when compared with our first-generation algorithm in a swine distributive shock model.

### Practice parameters for hemodynamic support of sepsis in adult patients: 2004 update [^112eUxwh]. Critical Care Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to provide the American College of Critical Care Medicine with updated guidelines for hemodynamic support of adult patients with sepsis.

Publications relevant to the hemodynamic support of septic patients were obtained from medical literature. This was supplemented by the expertise and experience of members of an international task force convened from the membership of the Society of Critical Care Medicine.

Both human studies and relevant animal studies were considered. The experts reviewed the literature and classified the strength of evidence of human studies based on study design and scientific value. Recommendations were drafted, graded, and leveled according to an evidence-based rating system described in the text. The recommendations were debated, and the task force chairman modified the document until less than 10% of the experts disagreed with the recommendations.

An organized approach to the hemodynamic support of sepsis was formulated. The fundamental principle is that clinicians using hemodynamic therapies should define specific goals and end points, titrate therapies to those end points, and evaluate the results of their interventions on an ongoing basis by monitoring a combination of variables of global and regional perfusion. Using this approach, specific recommendations for fluid resuscitation, vasopressor therapy, and inotropic therapy in adult patients with sepsis were promulgated.

### The evolution of mean arterial pressure in critically ill patients on vasopressors before and during a trial comparing a specific mean arterial pressure target to usual care [^111S4RKY]. BMC Anesthesiology (2022). High credibility.

For patients included in the trial, day one refers to the day of randomization, whereas for patients in the other two groups, day one is defined as the day vasopressor therapy began. We recorded dose rates for all vasopressor agents used (i.e. phenylephrine, epinephrine, vasopressin, and dopamine), converting them to norepinephrine equivalents using a previously published formula. Severity of illness was assessed by the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score in the 24 hours following ICU admission. A patient's mean arterial pressure (MAP) values while receiving vasopressors were collected hourly from day one until 24 hours following discontinuation of vasopressors or day seven, whichever came first. Since blood pressure values are commonly measured multiple times per hour in ICUs, we used the values recorded closest to each hour mark, following the same instructions as in the OVATION-65 trial. We calculated the mean MAP while receiving vasopressors for each patient using all hourly recorded values while patients were receiving vasopressors, ignoring MAP values once vasopressors were discontinued.

In addition to actual MAP values, we collected from medical records hourly MAP targets, as prescribed by treating teams in the physician orders, as well as the following clinical outcomes: complications (supraventricular arrhythmia, ventricular arrhythmia, myocardial ischemia, clinically detected stroke, extremity ischemia, mesenteric ischemia, and severe acute kidney injury, as defined by stage 3 Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes criteria). We also collected data on the duration of ICU and hospital stay.

### Best vasopressor for advanced vasodilatory shock: Should vasopressin be part of the mix [^114gRdYU]. Intensive Care Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Since the publication of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines, a number of additional and highly relevant studies have been published addressing the issue of vasopressor use during septic shock. While these new results are provocative, none of the studies are definitive. In sum, they suggest that we should not think of one vasopressor versus another in a winner-takes-all sense. Rather, we should be looking for the best balance of vasopressor agents; further, the choice likely depends on the clinical context.

Clinical context may drive the choice of adrenergic agonist. For example, norepinephrine may be superior to dopamine when the potential for arrhythmias is a concern. Additionally, norepinephrine may be superior to epinephrine if elevated lactate associated with epinephrine use confounds the clinical picture.

The Vasopressin and Septic Shock Trial (VASST) identified an effective dose of arginine vasopressin (AVP) when adrenergic agonist doses are low. However, higher doses of AVP may be appropriate in the context of very high adrenergic agonist doses. The effect may be a direct beneficial AVP effect or an indirect sparing of adrenergic agonist use.

The choice to add AVP may also be influenced by the clinical context, including renal function or the concomitant use of corticosteroids. These interim conclusions are hypotheses warranting randomized controlled trials adequately powered to test for survival differences in these severely ill patients.

### The surviving sepsis campaign: Fluid resuscitation and vasopressor therapy research priorities in adult patients [^116JnXM9]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

There exist notable gaps in our understanding and several directions for future research regarding fluid resuscitation and vasopressor therapy in adult patients with sepsis.

- **Individualizing fluid resuscitation**: Should we individualize the initial amount of fluid resuscitation and, if so, how? Applying a standard fluid dose to all patients with sepsis is inconsistent with other areas of sepsis management, where efforts are made to personalize care where possible. What alternative strategies can be readily used in clinical practice to individualize the initial amount of fluid resuscitation to maximize benefit and reduce harms?

- **Variables for titration**: Which variables should be used to titrate fluid resuscitation? Rigorous trials comparing various dynamic and static variables to evaluate fluid responsiveness are needed. Furthermore, testing various dynamic variables in subgroups of patients with sepsis would be informative. Trials should be designed to incorporate multiple methods of assessing fluid responsiveness.

- **Optimal timing**: What is the optimal timing for fluid resuscitation? After the rapid identification of sepsis and septic shock, time-series studies of fluid resuscitation are needed, especially evaluating the benefits and harms of additional therapies (e.g. vasopressors) and their respective interplay.

- **Triggering fluid resuscitation and deresuscitation**: Which variables should be used to trigger fluid resuscitation and deresuscitation? Related to the timing of fluid resuscitation, should a particular set of physiologic variables be assessed in a serial fashion to determine when to shift from resuscitation to deresuscitation in a structured manner?

- **Combined approach**: Is a combined approach using several indices of fluid responsiveness better than using a single measurement in isolation?

### Cleviprex [^1176o4WF]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Cleviprex is intended for intravenous use. Titrate the drug to achieve the desired blood pressure reduction. Individualize the dosage depending on the blood pressure to be obtained and the response of the patient.

- **Initial dose**: Initiate the intravenous infusion of Cleviprex at 1–2 mg/hour.

- **Dose titration**: The dose may be doubled at short (90-second) intervals initially. As the blood pressure approaches the goal, the increase in doses should be less than doubling, and the time between dose adjustments should be lengthened to every 5–10 minutes. An approximately 1–2 mg/hour increase will generally produce an additional 2–4 mmHg decrease in systolic pressure.

- **Maintenance dose**: The desired therapeutic response for most patients occurs at doses of 4–6 mg/hour. Patients with severe hypertension may require doses up to 32 mg/hour, but there is limited experience at this dose rate.

- **Maximum dose**: Most patients were treated with maximum doses of 16 mg/hour or less. There is limited short-term experience with doses up to 32 mg/hour. Because of lipid load restrictions, no more than 1000 mL or an average of 21 mg/hour of Cleviprex infusion is recommended per 24-hour period. In clinical trials, 55 hypertensive patients were treated with more than 500 mL of Cleviprex infusion per 24-hour period. There is little experience with infusion durations beyond 72 hours at any dose.

- **Transition to an oral antihypertensive agent**: Discontinue Cleviprex or titrate downward while appropriate oral therapy is established. When an oral antihypertensive agent is being instituted, consider the lag time.

### Vasopressor use and effect on blood pressure after severe adult traumatic brain injury [^114TrNgZ]. Neurocritical Care (2011). Low credibility.

We describe institutional vasopressor usage and examine the effect of vasopressors on hemodynamics: heart rate (HR), mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), intracranial pressure (ICP), cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), brain tissue oxygenation (PbtO2), and jugular venous oximetry (SjVO2) in adults with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI).

- **Methods**: We performed a retrospective analysis of 114 severely head-injured patients who were admitted to the neurocritical care unit of a Level 1 trauma center and who received vasopressors (phenylephrine, norepinephrine, dopamine, vasopressin, or epinephrine) to increase blood pressure.

- **Results**: Phenylephrine was the most commonly used vasopressor (43%), followed by norepinephrine (30%), dopamine (22%), and vasopressin (5%). Adjusted for age, gender, injury severity score, vasopressor dose, baseline blood pressure, fluid administration, propofol sedation, and hypertonic saline infusion, phenylephrine use was associated with 8 mmHg higher mean arterial pressure (MAP) than dopamine (P = 0.03), and 12 mmHg higher cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) than norepinephrine (P = 0.02) during the 3 hours after vasopressor start. There was no difference in ICP between the drug groups, either at baseline or after vasopressor treatment.

- **Conclusions**: Most severe TBI patients received phenylephrine. Patients who received phenylephrine had higher MAP and CPP than patients who received dopamine and norepinephrine, respectively.

### Vasopressors in cardiac arrest: A systematic review [^117PE8vw]. Resuscitation (2012). Low credibility.

To review the literature addressing whether the use of vasopressors improves outcomes in patients who suffer cardiac arrest, databases were searched using the terms: "(adrenaline or noradrenaline or vasopressor) and (heart arrest or cardiac arrest) and therapy". Inclusion criteria were human studies, controlled trials, meta-analysis, or case series. Articles with no abstract, abstract-only citations without accompanying articles, non-English abstracts, vasopressor studies without human clinical trials, case reports, reviews, and articles addressing traumatic arrest were excluded.

A total of 1,603 papers were identified, of which 53 articles were included for review. The literature addressed five main therapeutic questions:

- **Outcomes comparing any vasopressor to placebo**: Epinephrine is associated with improvement in short-term survival outcomes compared to placebo, but no long-term survival benefit has been demonstrated.
- **Outcomes comparing vasopressin (alone or in combination with epinephrine) to epinephrine**: Vasopressin is equivalent for use as an initial vasopressor when compared to epinephrine.
- **Outcomes comparing high dose epinephrine to standard dose epinephrine**: There is a short-term benefit but no long-term survival benefit.
- **Outcomes comparing any alternative vasopressor to epinephrine**.
- **Outcomes examining vasopressor use in pediatric cardiac arrest**.

In conclusion, there are few studies that compare vasopressors to placebo in resuscitation from cardiac arrest. Further research is needed to assess long-term outcomes and determine the effectiveness of various vasopressor treatments.

### A modified delphi to define drug dosing errors in pediatric critical care [^111bvQts]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Low credibility.

There is no globally accepted definition for dosing error in adult or pediatric practice. The definition of pediatric dosing error varies greatly in the literature. The objective of this study was to develop a framework, informed by a set of principles, for a clinician-based definition of drug dosing errors in critically ill children, and to identify the range that practitioners agree is a dosing error for different drug classes and clinical scenarios.

- **Methods**: We conducted a nationwide three-staged modified Delphi from May to December 2019. Expert clinicians included Canadian pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) physicians, pharmacists, and nurses with at least 5 years of experience. Outcomes were underlying principles of drug dosing and error thresholds, as defined by the proportion above and below reference range, for common PICU medications and clinical scenarios.

- **Results**: Forty-four participants met eligibility, and response rates were 95%, 86%, and 84% for all three rounds, respectively. Consensus was achieved for 13 of 15 principles and 23 of 30 error thresholds. Agreed principles of dosing error included an overdosed drug that is intercepted, an under-dose of a possibly life-saving medication, dosing 50% above or below the target range, and not adjusting for a drug interaction. Although there remained much uncertainty in defining dosing error, expert clinicians agreed that, for most medication categories and clinical scenarios, dosing over or below 10% of the reference range was considered an error threshold.

- **Conclusion**: Dosing principles and thresholds are complex in pediatric critical care.

### Living guidance for clinical management of COVID-19 [^115ne9XC]. WHO Living Guidance (2023). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of COVID-19 infection, specifically concerning intravenous vasopressors, WHO 2023 guidelines recommend administering vasopressors to adult patients with COVID-19 when shock persists during or after fluid resuscitation. The initial blood pressure target should be a mean arterial pressure of ≥ 65 mmHg in adult patients to improve markers of perfusion.

### Evaluation of vasopressor exposure and mortality in patients with septic shock [^115QvCjE]. Critical Care Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

The objectives of this study were to determine the association between vasopressor dosing intensity during the first 6 hours and the first 24 hours after the onset of septic shock and 30-day in-hospital mortality; to investigate whether the effect of vasopressor dosing intensity varies by fluid resuscitation volume; and to evaluate if the effect of vasopressor dosing intensity varies by dosing titration pattern.

This was a multicenter prospective cohort study conducted between September 2017 and February 2018. Vasopressor dosing intensity was defined as the total vasopressor dose infused across all vasopressors converted to norepinephrine equivalents, conducted across thirty-three hospital sites in the United States (n = 32) and Jordan (n = 1). The study included consecutive adults requiring admission to the ICU with septic shock and treated with one or more vasopressors within 24 hours of shock onset.

A total of 1,639 patients were screened, and 616 were included in the study. Norepinephrine was the most commonly used vasopressor, administered to 93% of patients. The patients received a median of 3,400 mL (interquartile range, 1,851–5,338 mL) of fluid during the 24 hours following shock diagnosis. The median vasopressor dosing intensity during the first 24 hours of shock onset was 8.5 μg/min norepinephrine equivalents (interquartile range, 3.4–18.1 μg/min norepinephrine equivalents). An increase in vasopressor dosing intensity during the first 6 hours was associated with a higher odds ratio of 30-day in-hospital mortality, with the strength of this association being influenced by concomitant fluid administration.
