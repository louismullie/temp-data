## Question

Did the CANDOR trial in Alzheimer's disease demonstrate improved long-term survival?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a CANDOR trial in Alzheimer's disease demonstrated improved long-term survival. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether a trial named CANDOR actually appears in the supplied references. Then, I should verify what major Alzheimer's monoclonal antibody trials are included and what outcomes they report. Next, I will examine whether any of those trials reported mortality or long-term survival outcomes. Finally, I will synthesize whether the question can be answered from this dataset or if clarification is needed, while considering safety and methodological issues that could impact survival analyses.

> Let me first confirm whether a "CANDOR" trial is present in the provided reference set; I need to check carefully for exact name matches or close variants that could be confused with it, and I should double-check that I'm not missing an alternative trial acronym used for an Alzheimer's study, but I do not see any trial labeled CANDOR in the list, which instead prominently includes CLARITY-AD for lecanemab, TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 for donanemab, GRADUATE I/II for gantenerumab, and EXPEDITION3 for solanezumab [^115aDWqE] [^117Fygqy] [^112oGQnS] [^1173ukdq].

> Next, I should review what outcomes these included Alzheimer's trials actually measured; hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about survival before verifying endpoints because these late-phase studies were designed around cognitive and functional outcomes over relatively short horizons (approximately 18 to 116 weeks), such as CDR-SB, ADAS-Cog, iADRS, and ADCS-MCI-ADL rather than mortality endpoints, which aligns with how CLARITY-AD, TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2, and GRADUATE I/II were structured and reported [^115aDWqE] [^117Fygqy] [^112oGQnS].

> Wait, let me verify whether any mortality or survival signals were reported as primary or secondary outcomes; I need to ensure I'm not overlooking safety tables that sometimes include death counts, and indeed EXPEDITION3 reported deaths descriptively without a survival analysis framework (0.9% vs 1.6% solanezumab vs placebo at 80 weeks), while the pivotal lecanemab and donanemab publications and regulatory materials emphasize clinical decline and safety, not long-term survival, with the labels foregrounding ARIA risk rather than mortality benefit, which supports the inference that survival was not a targeted endpoint in these programs [^1173ukdq] [^115aDWqE] [^117Fygqy] [^11216ZYY].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 might have included a survival analysis given its 76-week duration; let me reconsider and recheck the JAMA report and related summaries to confirm, but the published data focus on iADRS and CDR-SB changes and do not present Kaplan–Meier survival analyses or hazard ratios for mortality, reinforcing that no long-term survival benefit was reported in that trial publication [^117Fygqy] [^115x31T2].

> I will now examine whether any long-term post-trial or extension survival follow-up is summarized in these materials; hold on, I should verify that none of the cited meta-analyses or commentaries claim mortality benefits, and indeed the discussions emphasize modest slowing of cognitive/functional decline, questions about clinical meaningfulness, and safety concerns including ARIA, without presenting survival advantages, which further suggests that improved long-term survival has not been demonstrated in this evidence set [^111UwA9k] [^117Fygqy] [^114ywitW].

> But wait, what if the user is conflating CANDOR with another trial acronym or with a study in a different disease area; I should note that, within this provided Alzheimer's document set, CANDOR is absent, and among the included anti-amyloid trials there are no long-term survival outcomes reported, so I cannot substantiate a claim of improved survival from these data and would need either the exact Alzheimer's trial citation intended by "CANDOR" or an external source to evaluate survival effects [^115aDWqE] [^117Fygqy] [^112oGQnS].

> In summary, I need to ensure my conclusion matches the evidence: there is no CANDOR trial in the supplied Alzheimer's references and no trial herein demonstrates improved long-term survival; the available evidence centers on short- to medium-term slowing of clinical decline with safety trade-offs, particularly ARIA, and does not address mortality benefits, so clarifying the intended trial name or providing a specific citation would be necessary to assess survival outcomes [^115aDWqE] [^117Fygqy] [^114ywitW].

I **cannot find** an Alzheimer's trial named "CANDOR". Please confirm the study name or provide additional details (drug, sponsor, or a link). If you meant:

- **CLARITY-AD (lecanemab)**: slowed clinical decline [^115aDWqE] at 18 months [^111s68Pv], but no long-term survival benefit reported [^115x31T2].
- **TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 (donanemab)**: slowed decline [^117Fygqy] at 76 weeks [^117Fygqy], but no long-term survival benefit reported [^115Doipa].
- **GRADUATE I/II (gantenerumab)**: no significant clinical benefit [^112oGQnS] [^116aEvBm] and no survival benefit reported [^113j8xww].

Please confirm the **exact study** so I can provide a precise answer.

### Two phase 3 trials of gantenerumab in early Alzheimer's disease [^116aEvBm]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2023). High credibility.

The study, GRADUATE II, was published by Randall J. Bateman and colleagues in 2023 in the journal *The New England Journal of Medicine*. This study is related to Alzheimer's disease. In the GRADUATE II study, the trial question was the role of gantenerumab in patients with early Alzheimer's disease. The study design was a multi-center, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial (RCT). The population included 975 patients, comprising 573 females and 402 males. The inclusion criteria required patients aged 50–90 with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or mild dementia due to Alzheimer's disease, along with evidence of amyloid plaques.

The key exclusion criteria were the receipt of anticoagulants or GV-971, and clinically significant findings on MRI at screening that could cause cognitive impairment. The interventions involved 498 patients receiving gantenerumab (target level of 510 mg every 2 weeks) and 477 patients receiving a matching placebo.

- **Primary outcome**: No significant difference was observed in the improvement on the Clinical Dementia Rating scale-Sum of Boxes score at week 116 (2.82 points vs. 3.01 points; AD -0.19 points, 95% CI -0.55 to 0.17).

- **Secondary outcomes**: A significant decrease was observed in the improvement of the 13-item cognitive subscale of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale score at week 116 (6.66 points vs. 7.94 points; AD -1.28 points, 95% CI -2.41 to -0.14). No significant difference was noted in the reduction of the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living Inventory total score at week 116 (-8.44 points vs. -9.26 points; AD 0.82 points, 95% CI -0.7 to 2).

### Pharmacologic and nutritional interventions for early Alzheimer's disease: A systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^111LXWCC]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2024). High credibility.

Noted that three new drugs, namely aducanumab, donanemab, and lecanemab, are all anti-amyloid monoclonal antibodies that target the underlying biology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). These drugs function by eliminating amyloid-β from the brain and mitigating cognitive and functional deterioration in individuals with early AD who exhibit evidence of amyloid-β accumulation in the brain through brain imaging or cerebrospinal fluid analysis. It is crucial to have treatments that address the full scope of Alzheimer's biology rather than solely targeting amyloid-β. However, not all anti-amyloid monoclonal antibody treatments have shown favorable effects, such as gantenerumab, solanezumab, and crenezumab.

It is worth noting that new drugs designed to lower amyloid levels can lead to amyloid-related imaging abnormalities with edema (ARIA-E) and hemosiderin deposition (ARIA-H). Lecanemab had a 12.6% occurrence of ARIA-E and 17.3% for ARIA-H. Donanemab had rates of 24.0% for ARIA-E and 19.7% for ARIA-H. Aducanumab showed 30.7% for ARIA-E and 17.8% for ARIA-H microhemorrhage. However, in the control groups, the rates of ARIA-E were below 3% and ARIA-H were below 10%. It is important to be cautious when using these medications due to the risk of ARIA.

### Trailblazer-ALZ 4: A phase 3 trial comparing donanemab with aducanumab on amyloid plaque clearance in early, symptomatic Alzheimer's disease [^116uoNxp]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). High credibility.

- **AP clearance**: At 12 months, 70.0% (42 of 60) of donanemab-treated participants and 24.6% (15 of 61) of aducanumab-treated participants reached AP clearance (P < 0.001) in the overall population (Figure 3A). Similarly, at 18 months, 76.8% (43 of 56) of donanemab-treated participants versus 43.1% (25 of 58) of aducanumab-treated participants reached AP clearance (P < 0.001; Figure 3B). In the low–medium tau subpopulation, 76.0% (19 of 25) and 72.0% (18 of 25) of donanemab-treated participants versus 18.5% (5 of 27) and 43.5% (10 of 23) of aducanumab-treated participants reached AP clearance at 12 months (P < 0.001) and 18 months (P = 0.022).

- **Superiority of donanemab**: Figure 3 illustrates the superiority of donanemab versus aducanumab in AP clearance at (A) 12 months and (B) 18 months, and (C) time to achieve AP clearance. P value for (A) and (B) is derived from a longitudinal logistic regression model. P value for (C) is a two-sided log-rank unstratified P value comparing donanemab versus aducanumab. One participant who achieved amyloid clearance (< 24.1 CL) at week 52 did not meet the threshold for amyloid clearance at week 76.

### A framework for best practices and readiness in the advent of anti-amyloid therapy for early Alzheimer's disease in Asia [^116yvSBw]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2024). Low credibility.

Advances in biomarker-based diagnostic modalities, recent approval of anti-amyloid monoclonal antibodies for early Alzheimer's disease (AD; mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia due to AD) and the late-stage clinical development of other disease-modifying therapies for AD necessitate a significant paradigm shift in the early detection, diagnosis, and management of AD. Anti-amyloid monoclonal antibodies target the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of AD and have demonstrated a significant reduction in the rate of clinical decline in cognitive and functional outcome measures in patients with early AD.

With the growing recognition of the benefit of early interventions in AD, an increasing number of people may seek diagnosis for their subjective cognitive problems in an already busy medical system. Various factors, such as limited examination time, lack of expertise for cognitive assessment, and limited access to specialized tests, can impact diagnostic accuracy and timely detection of AD. To overcome these challenges, a new model of care will be required.

In this paper, we provide practical guidance for institutional readiness for anti-amyloid therapies for early AD in Asia, focusing on best practices for identifying eligible patients, diagnosing them appropriately, safe administration of anti-amyloid monoclonal antibodies, monitoring of treatment, managing potential adverse events such as infusion reactions and amyloid-related imaging abnormalities, and cross-disciplinary collaboration. Education and training will be the cornerstone for the establishment of new pathways.

### Donanemab exposure-response in early symptomatic Alzheimer's disease [^114SaF2m]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). High credibility.

- **Methods**: Models were generated using data from participants enrolled in four donanemab clinical trials: the phase 1b study (NCT02624778), TRAILBLAZER‐ALZ (phase 2; NCT03367403), TRAILBLAZER‐EXT (phase 2 long‐term extension parts B and C; NCT04640077), and TRAILBLAZER‐ALZ 2 (phase 3; placebo‐controlled portion and safety addendum; NCT04437511).

- **Participants and study design**: The donanemab phase 1b trial was a randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled study involving men and women with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to Alzheimer's disease (AD) or mild to moderate dementia due to AD. Inclusion criteria included Mini‐Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores of 16 to 30 and the presence of amyloid pathology. Placebo or donanemab was administered by intravenous infusion as a single (10, 20, or 40 mg/kg) or multiple doses (10 mg/kg every 2 weeks for 24 weeks or 10 or 20 mg/kg every 4 weeks for 72 weeks).

### Failure to demonstrate efficacy of aducanumab: An analysis of the EMERGE and ENGAGE trials as reported by Biogen, December 2019 [^115j1ezk]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2021). Low credibility.

Aducanumab recently underwent two large phase III clinical trials that were stopped prematurely by the sponsor, Biogen. One trial was trending positive, while the other showed no benefits from aducanumab. Post hoc analyses led the sponsor to assert that there was a sufficient efficacy signal to justify a new drug application as a treatment for Alzheimer's disease. The sponsor claimed that subsets of participants receiving sufficiently high doses of aducanumab demonstrated benefits in both trials.

In contrast, we identified alternative accounts for the apparent drug benefits in post hoc subgroups that are unrelated to dose effects. Biomarker data were consistent with target engagement, but no evidence was presented to correlate biomarker changes to cognitive benefits. Our analysis supports the conduct of a third, phase III trial with high-dose aducanumab. Aducanumab's efficacy as a treatment for the cognitive dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease cannot be proven by clinical trials with divergent outcomes.

### Potential impact of unblinding on observed treatment effects in Alzheimer's disease trials [^114D2g3H]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2024). High credibility.

Adverse effects of monoclonal antibodies against amyloid beta are common and may affect the validity of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) through the unblinding of participants.

We used observations from published phase 3 RCTs in Alzheimer's disease to calculate the magnitude of unblinding effects on cognition that would be required to explain observed cognitive benefits in RCTs. In trials of lecanemab, aducanumab, and donanemab, the incidence of amyloid‐related imaging abnormalities with active treatment ranged from 22% to 44%, the vast majority of which presumably led to unblinding. Effects of unblinding on the Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes required to fully explain observed drug effects ranged from 1.1 point (95% confidence interval: 0.2–2.0) with aducanumab, to 3.3 points (2.1–4.4) with donanemab, and 3.7 points (2.0–5.6) with lecanemab. Infusion‐related reactions were common, with potential unblinding effects particularly for lecanemab. Similar patterns were observed for the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale Cognitive subscale.

Psychological treatment effects due to unblinding may explain a substantial share of observed treatment effects in RCTs.

### Lithium trial in Alzheimer's disease: a randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter 10-week study [^113WxXV5]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2009). Low credibility.

Lithium, a first-line drug for the treatment of bipolar depression, has recently been shown to regulate glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3), a kinase involved in the phosphorylation of the tau protein. Since hyperphosphorylation of tau is a core pathological feature in Alzheimer's disease, lithium-induced inhibition of GSK-3 activity may have therapeutic effects in Alzheimer's disease. In this study, we tested the effect of short-term lithium treatment in patients with Alzheimer's disease.

A total of 71 patients with mild Alzheimer's disease (Mini-Mental State Examination score ≥ 21) was observed. Lithium treatment did not lead to a change in global cognitive performance as measured by the ADAS-Cog subscale (P = 0.11) or in depressive symptoms.

These results indicate that short-term lithium treatment does not significantly impact cognitive performance or depressive symptoms in patients with mild Alzheimer's disease.

### How donanemab data address the coverage with evidence development questions [^117A96sh]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2024). High credibility.

Understanding the clinical relevance of a treatment effect expressed as a percent slowing or as a point difference between two treatment arms is not necessarily intuitive. Providing information on drug effect as a time metric instead (i.e. months saved with treatment) conveys meaningfulness more directly and is of value to the clinician, patient, and care partner. In the low/medium tau population of TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2, disease progression with donanemab treatment was delayed by 4.36 months based on the iADRS and 7.53 months based on the CDR-SB. In the combined (low/medium and high) tau population, disease progression was delayed by 2.47 months based on iADRS and 5.44 months based on CDR-SB. These results demonstrate the ability of donanemab to keep people in the earlier stages of disease longer, preserving their cognition and functional independence longer.

- **Stability of clinical symptoms**: Nearly half (47%) of TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 participants in the low/medium tau population treated with donanemab remained clinically stable at 1 year (defined by no change in CDR-SB at 1 year), compared to 29% on placebo (P < 0.001). In the combined tau population, clinical stability was achieved in 36% of donanemab versus 23% of placebo participants (P < 0.001).

- **Lower risk of advancement to the next clinical stage**: At 18 months, TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 participants in the low/medium tau population treated with donanemab experienced a 39% lower risk.

- **Coprimary outcomes**: AP clearance was defined as < 24.1 CL as assessed by florbetapir PET. In the overall population, 37.9% (25 of 66) of donanemab‐treated participants versus 1.6% (1 of 64) of aducanumab‐treated participants reached AP clearance at 6 months (P < 0.001). In the low–medium tau subpopulation, 38.5% (10 of 26) of donanemab‐treated participants versus 3.8% (1 of 26) of aducanumab‐treated participants reached AP clearance at 6 months (P = 0.008).

### Trial of solanezumab for mild dementia due to Alzheimer's disease [^1173ukdq]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2018). High credibility.

The study EXPEDITION3 was published by Honig LS and colleagues in 2018 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to dementia. In the EXPEDITION3 study, the trial question was: what is the effect of solanezumab in patients with mild dementia due to Alzheimer's disease and with amyloid deposition? The study design was a multi-center, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial (RCT), involving 2,129 patients (1,231 female and 898 male).

The inclusion criteria were patients with mild dementia due to Alzheimer's disease with amyloid deposition, as shown by florbetapir positron-emission tomography or Abeta1–42 measurements in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Key exclusion criteria included depression, serious or unstable medical conditions, recent infections, malignancies or psychiatric illnesses within the past five years, compromised renal function, and clinically significant ECG abnormalities.

- **Interventions**: n = 1057 received solanezumab (intravenous infusion at a dose of 400 mg every four weeks for 76 weeks); n = 1072 received placebo (intravenous infusion every four weeks for 76 weeks).

- **Primary outcome**: No significant difference in ADAS-cog14 score at 80 weeks (6.65 points vs. 7.44 points; AD -0.8 points, 95% CI -1.73 to 0.14).

- **Safety outcomes**: No significant differences in adverse events (84.5% vs. 83.4%), adverse cerebral edema or effusion (1 vs. 2 patients), serious adverse events (16.6% vs. 18.9%), and deaths (0.9% vs. 1.6%).

### Are lecanemab and donanemab disease-modifying therapies [^111UwA9k]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2024). High credibility.

Encouraging results from two large 18-month, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies of the anti-amyloid beta (Aβ) monoclonal antibodies (mAb) lecanemab and donanemab in early Alzheimer's disease (AD) have motivated claims that they are disease-modifying. Indeed, these trials dramatically reduced brain Aβ-positron emission tomography (PET) burden and demonstrated a highly significant, albeit clinically modest, delay of cognitive decline. We define disease-modifying as a causal intervention with a corresponding long-term benefit rather than short-term symptomatic improvement observed with previously approved drugs affecting cholinergic neurotransmission. We discuss two testable criteria for disease modification and whether these mAbs have fulfilled them.

### Passive anti-amyloid β immunotherapy in Alzheimer's disease-opportunities and challenges [^114TAGWm]. Lancet (2024). Low credibility.

With the advent of the first disease-modifying, anti-amyloid β-directed passive immunotherapy for Alzheimer's disease, questions arise about who, when, and how to treat. This paper briefly describes the pathogenic basis and preclinical data that, more than two decades ago, initiated the development of this vaccination therapy. We discuss clinical trial results of aducanumab, lecanemab, and donanemab. We also review appropriate use recommendations of these novel treatments regarding patient selection and safety monitoring. Furthermore, estimations of the number of patients who will qualify for treatment concerning inclusion and exclusion criteria, as well as estimations on the readiness of health care systems for identifying the right patients and providing the treatment, are reported. In our view, we are experiencing a fundamental shift from syndrome-based Alzheimer's dementia care to early, biomarker-guided treatment of Alzheimer's disease. This shift requires substantial adjustments of infrastructure and resources but also holds the promise of eventually achieving substantial slowing of disease progression and delaying dementia.

### How donanemab data address the coverage with evidence development questions [^112hVNxJ]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2024). Low credibility.

Determining that AD treatments are clinically meaningful is critical. In 2022, a group of experienced and internationally recognized clinicians and researchers examined what is considered a meaningful benefit or slowing of progression of AD, keeping patients' and families' needs in mind. The workgroup concluded that slowing of disease progression in the early stages of AD could translate to more time in the less impaired and more functional stages of the disease and a delay in the onset of decline. Preserving function could help maintain independence and autonomy, the crux of meaningfulness for patients with early symptomatic AD.

The next sections will demonstrate the clinical meaningfulness of donanemab treatment by:

- **Magnitude of slowing of clinical decline**
- **Slowing of disease progression time**
- **Stability of clinical symptoms (i.e. no decline)**
- **Lower risk of advancement to the next clinical stage**
- **Lower risk of meaningful within-patient change**:

- **Meaningful improved health outcomes demonstrated in TRAILBLAZER‐ALZ 2**:

### Anti-amyloid antibody treatments for Alzheimer's disease [^115ss7Xy]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Low credibility.

Anti-amyloid antibody treatments are a promising avenue for Alzheimer's disease. However, there are potential conflicts of interest to consider. R.P. has received honoraria for advisory boards and speaker engagements from pharmaceutical companies including Roche, EISAI, Eli Lilly, Biogen, Janssen-Cilag, Astra Zeneca, Schwabe, Grifols, Novo Nordisk, and Tabuk. Additionally, R.P. was the principal investigator on the aducanumab phase 3 trials. Similarly, P.F. has received research support or honoraria for lectures or advisory activities from companies such as Boehringer-Ingelheim, Janssen, Lundbeck, Otsuka, Recordati, and Richter.

These financial relationships must be taken into account when interpreting the findings and implications of this research.

An international task force of investigators from academia, industry, nonprofit foundations, and regulatory agencies met in Monte Carlo, Monaco, on October 31, 2012, to review lessons learned from the recent bapineuzumab and solanezumab trials and to incorporate insights gained from these trials into future clinical studies. Although there is broad consensus that Alzheimer's disease (AD) should be treated during its earliest stages, the concept of secondary prevention has evolved to be described more accurately as treatment of preclinical, presymptomatic, or early AD.

There continues to be a strong emphasis on biomarkers and a need for new biomarkers; however, there has also been a realization, based on completed trials, that the most reliable indicator of clinical efficacy across the entire spectrum of disease from asymptomatic to AD dementia is likely a measure of cognition.

The task force made many recommendations that should improve the likelihood of success in future trials, including larger phase 2 or combined phase 2/phase 3 studies, clear evidence of target engagement in the central nervous system, evidence of downstream effects on biomarkers before initiating phase 3 studies, consideration of adaptive and targeted trial designs, and use of sensitive measures of cognition as the most robust indicator of treatment benefit.

### Anti-amyloid antibody treatments for Alzheimer's disease [^117FfwYT]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Low credibility.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the progressive decline of cognitive and functional abilities. It is the most common form of dementia, accounting for up to 70% of all cases. The prevalence of AD increases with age, affecting approximately 10% of individuals over 65 years of age and up to 50% of individuals over 85 years of age. In addition to its impact on individuals, AD has a significant economic burden on society, with estimated annual costs of $305 billion in the United States alone.

The underlying pathology of AD is characterized by the accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles composed of hyperphosphorylated tau protein in the brain. These pathological hallmarks disrupt normal neuronal communication and ultimately lead to neuronal death and cognitive decline. Until recently, there were no disease-modifying therapies for AD. However, several anti-Aβ monoclonal antibody treatments have been developed in recent years, targeting the accumulation of Aβ in the brain. Here, the expected effects of these new antibody treatments for AD, including their potential impact on disease progression, biomarkers for diagnosis, and future developments in the field, are discussed.

### Current advances and unmet needs in Alzheimer's disease trials for individuals with Down syndrome: Navigating new therapeutic frontiers [^1118D7gH]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). High credibility.

Aβ (pyroglutamate‐Aβ) has shown similarly promising results. In Phase 3 trials (TRAILBLAZER‐ALZ 2), donanemab reduced amyloid plaques and slowed disease progression by approximately 29% in patients with early‐stage Alzheimer's disease (AD). Notably, its ability to clear amyloid plaques rapidly and achieve meaningful cognitive and functional benefits further solidifies its potential as a transformative therapy in AD treatment.

Despite these advances, in the pivotal trials of lecanemab and donanemab, individuals with Down syndrome (DS) were excluded. Although the diagnosis of DS itself was not listed as a formal exclusion criterion, most trials excluded individuals with intellectual disabilities or pre‐existing neurodevelopmental conditions, indirectly excluding the DS population. Moreover, eligibility criteria related to age, cognitive status, or coexisting medical conditions may have further limited participation. For example, the Clarity AD trial included participants aged 50 to 90, and the TRAILBLAZER‐ALZ 2 trial enrolled participants aged 60 to 85; these age ranges do not align with the earlier onset of AD in the DS population, which typically begins in the fourth or fifth decade of life. More generally, most AD trials include age eligibility criteria that do not capture younger adults with DS who are at the highest risk. In addition, the outcome measures used to evaluate cognitive and functional change are not adapted or validated for individuals with intellectual disability. Although these factors were not formal exclusion criteria, they rendered participation infeasible for individuals with DS.

### Cost-effectiveness of diagnosing and treating patients with early Alzheimer's disease with anti-amyloid treatment in a clinical setting [^113KB7Hb]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2025). Low credibility.

The higher incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of donanemab compared to lecanemab seems to be driven by the fact that the donanemab trial had treatment initiated at a somewhat older age, a larger proportion of the starting population had mild dementia, and a larger discontinuation rate. However, donanemab demonstrated a somewhat better treatment effect, with better net health benefits than lecanemab. It should be noted that we did not detail the treatment discontinuation due to amyloid clearance for donanemab, limiting the comparison of health-economic outcomes between the two drugs.

Our results align with previous modeling studies that assessed the cost-effectiveness of beta-amyloid biomarkers (BBM) combined with anti-amyloid treatment (AAT). Compared to Nguyen et al, we also found the strategy of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) testing and AAT treatment not cost-effective when using a similar treatment price, and cost-effective if the treatment price was significantly lower. The price threshold at which CSF-AAT was cost-effective differed due to differences in assumptions on sustained treatment effect, as well as the US compared to Swedish health-economic inputs and willingness to pay threshold. Compared to Aye et al, we also found a minor cost difference between CSF-AAT and BBM-CSF-AAT diagnostic strategies. However, our study showed a larger quality-adjusted life year (QALY) difference of 0.091 (compared to −0.002 in Aye et al.), which could be explained by the larger change from true positive to false negative and its consequential missed QALY benefits due to undertreatment. Like our study, they identified that a lower price for AAT is a necessary condition for diagnostic strategies to become potentially cost-effective.

### Increases in amyloid-β42 slow cognitive and clinical decline in Alzheimer's disease trials [^114kmk9L]. Brain (2024). High credibility.

Positive effects of new anti-amyloid-β (Aβ) monoclonal antibodies in Alzheimer's disease (AD) have been attributed to brain amyloid reduction. However, most anti-Aβ antibodies also increase the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of the 42-amino acid isoform (Aβ42). We evaluated the associations of changes in CSF Aβ42 and brain Aβ-PET with cognitive and clinical endpoints in randomized trials of anti-Aβ drugs that lowered (β- and γ-secretase inhibitors) or increased CSF Aβ42 levels (anti-Aβ monoclonal antibodies) to test the hypothesis that post-treatment increases in CSF Aβ42 levels are independently associated with cognitive and clinical outcomes.

From long-term (≥ 12 months) randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials of anti-Aβ drugs published until November 2023, we calculated the post-treatment versus baseline difference in ADAS-Cog (cognitive subscale of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale) and CDR-SB (Clinical Dementia Rate-Sum of Boxes) and z-standardized changes in CSF Aβ42 and Aβ-PET Centiloids (CL). We estimated the effect size using regression coefficients (RCs) and confidence intervals (CIs), and the heterogeneity (I²) of the associations between AD biomarkers and cognitive and clinical endpoints using random-effects meta-regression models.

We included 25,966 subjects with AD from 24 trials. In random-effects analysis, increases in CSF Aβ42 were associated with slower decline in ADAS-Cog (RC: -0.55; 95% CI: -0.89, -0.21, P = 0.003, I² = 61.4%) and CDR-SB (RC: -0.16; 95% CI: -0.26, -0.06, P = 0.002, I² = 34.5%). Similarly, decreases in Aβ-PET were associated with slower decline in AD.

### Alzheimer disease: Pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic therapies for cognitive and functional symptoms [^115TYWZd]. American Family Physician (2017). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for Alzheimer's disease, specifically concerning cholinesterase inhibitors, AAFP 2017 guidelines suggest offering cholinesterase inhibitors. This includes donepezil (5–10 mg/day), galantamine (at least 16 mg/day), or rivastigmine (6–12 mg/day orally or 9.5 mg/day transdermally) for the treatment of cognitive and functional decline in patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease.

### Precision diagnosis of cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease for therapeutic interventions [^111ELSje]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Low credibility.

With the advent of anti-amyloid monoclonal antibody (AAMA) therapy, precision diagnosis is necessary for identifying appropriate patients with cognitive disorders due to Alzheimer's disease. Therapy with AAMAs requires that candidates be diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia, have elevated brain amyloid-β, have good physical, psychiatric, and medical health, and lack clinical or biomarker evidence of potentially impactful non-Alzheimer brain disorders. The first three diagnostic activities are the core of the clinical practice guidelines, but the last element of the precision diagnosis requires new decision-making tools for recognizing multi-etiology cognitive impairment.

Within the context of shared decision-making between clinician, patient, and family, proper diagnosis is essential. In addition to discussing the benefits and risks of AAMA therapy, the experienced clinician must empathetically assist in bridging the gap between expectations of benefit and the patient's overall diagnostic suitability for AAMA therapy.

- **Highlights**: In order to prescribe an anti-amyloid monoclonal antibody (AAMA) to the right patients, those selected for treatment should be diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia, have elevated brain amyloid-β (Aβ), and have good physical, psychiatric, or medical health. Persons with Alzheimer's biology as the primary etiology are the ideal AAMA treatment recipients. A novel activity necessary to optimize therapeutic response is to exclude persons with clinical or biomarker evidence of alternative contributory brain disorders.

### Cost-effectiveness of diagnosing and treating patients with early Alzheimer's disease with anti-amyloid treatment in a clinical setting [^114n7zfN]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2025). High credibility.

Although our model assumes that removing amyloid from the brain has a positive effect on the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD), it does not imply that we regard the amyloid cascade hypothesis as the only cause of AD. The significant effect of amyloid removal in trials, combined with the rather modest effects on disease progression, may indicate that AD is a complex diagnostic entity. Our analysis assumes that the effects observed in the lecanemab and donanemab trials are unbiased and can be extrapolated beyond the trial follow-up period. However, there have been concerns regarding functional unblinding, biased observation of mortality, and conflicts of interest in assessing the clinical value of these treatments.

In our model, we have accounted for costs associated with monitoring treatment (to detect side effects like amyloid-related imaging abnormalities, or ARIAs), but we have not included costs for the treatment of side effects due to insufficient data, which may lead to an underestimation of treatment costs.

Furthermore, since long-term data are lacking in trials and, naturally, in clinical practice (with usage in the US still at a low and short-term level), estimating future costs of managing treatment effects and associated risks of anti-amyloid treatment (AAT) is challenging. While positron emission tomography (PET) would be desirable for evaluating the effects on brain amyloid versus cognition and function, its feasibility is questionable due to availability and cost constraints. For ARIA detection, the frequency of MRI scans is also unknown. However, it is realistic to assume that the number of follow-ups could be reduced after 1–2 years since such effects typically manifest early.

### Anti-amyloid antibody therapies in Alzheimer's disease [^1172NXEM]. Brain (2023). High credibility.

After years of failed attempts to develop a disease-modifying therapy for Alzheimer's disease, consistent evidence in support of clinical efficacy was finally presented for a monoclonal antibody targeting the amyloid-β protofibrils. In addition to meeting the primary outcome of slowing clinical disease progression over 18 months, secondary clinical outcomes and amyloid-β lowering on PET also underpin the positive results of the trial.

In this opinion piece, we highlight the key characteristics of the previous unsuccessful trials and analyze the potential reasons why those attempts to develop a treatment for early Alzheimer's disease failed. We compare the safety profiles of the different antibodies and highlight cautionary measures for their routine clinical use. Last, we discuss the role of blood-based biomarkers in transforming the clinical care pathway to facilitate the uptake of antibody treatments, proposing an integrated case-finding and treatment model crossing the different healthcare sectors.

Taken together, a real breakthrough may have been achieved by proving that amyloid-β reduction results in clinical benefits, rather than just biomarker changes. At the same time, routine use of the new generation of drugs will show if statistical efficacy translates into clinically meaningful change. This may just be the beginning of a new era of Alzheimer's disease drug development.

### A framework for best practices and readiness in the advent of anti-amyloid therapy for early Alzheimer's disease in Asia [^1136Ti1m]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2024). Low credibility.

Anti-amyloid monoclonal antibodies are promising disease-modifying therapies that have the potential to offer benefits to patients with early Alzheimer's Disease (AD) who would otherwise have been treated symptomatically. These agents will be particularly important in Asia, where the number of people living with AD is expected to more than double by the year 2050. It is imperative for healthcare systems across different countries in Asia to prepare for the availability of anti-amyloid therapies by establishing new clinical pathways and models of care.

Early identification of AD will be crucial, and biomarkers will guide the diagnosis, treatment initiation, and patient monitoring. Incorporation of anti-amyloid monoclonal antibodies into the treatment paradigm for eligible patients will require strong multidisciplinary collaboration, thorough clinical evaluation, development of protocols and infrastructure for infusion and treatment monitoring, and comprehensive training of all involved medical personnel. Clear and transparent communications about anti-amyloid therapies and the risks and benefits associated with them to patients and their families/caregivers will ensure their engagement and acceptance.

Finally, consistent and continuous educational efforts underscoring the importance of early diagnosis of AD in this era of innovative therapies, aimed at the general public, primary care physicians, and specialists, will be essential for optimizing patient outcomes.

### Trailblazer-Alz 4: A phase 3 trial comparing donanemab with aducanumab on amyloid plaque clearance in early, symptomatic Alzheimer's disease [^1122ULeB]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Low credibility.

The Trailblazer‐ALZ 4 trial had several limitations. It was an open‐label study, which enabled awareness of treatment allocation for both trial participants and investigators. This may have impacted safety reporting. However, MRI schedules were identical for both treatment groups, and a centrally blinded review of MRI scans and amyloid PET scans was performed. Due to the nature of an open‐label investigation, cognitive and functional measures were not performed, rendering any conclusions about greater or rapid amyloid clearance of unclear clinical significance. It is commonly accepted that if a particular drug requires a prolonged period to affect a positive change, that therapy is less preferable than a drug with a similar safety profile that requires less time to achieve the same effect. Another limitation was that mechanistic differences in therapies may not have been detected by amyloid PET alone. No methodology currently exists to measure soluble oligomers and insoluble fibrils.

In addition to trial design limitations, the diversity of trial participants remains a challenge in this therapeutic space. There is a need for an improved scale of participant reach, diversity of trial sites and locations, improved community outreach and retention, and a better understanding of the variables for screening failures for interested participants. Finally, the clinical relevance of this comparison is uncertain, given that aducanumab is no longer available. However, at the time of conception and design of Trailblazer-ALZ 4, it was anticipated that aducanumab would be available.

### Recalibrating the risk-benefit profiles of lecanemab and donanemab: Scales, immunoreactivity, and changes in amyloid-β42 [^11483thP]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2024). Low credibility.

Three recent anti-amyloid-β antibody trials for Alzheimer's disease reported similar effect sizes, used non-reactive saline as placebo, and showed large numbers of adverse events, including imaging anomalies (ARIA) that correlate with cognitive changes. Conversely, all previous antibody trials were less reactive and pronounced ineffective. We argue that these observations point to unblinding bias, inflating apparent efficacy and thus altering the risk-benefit balance. Further, we highlight data demonstrating that beyond reducing amyloid, monoclonal antibodies increase monomeric amyloid-β42 in cerebrospinal fluid, which may explain potential benefits. We should recalibrate the efficacy of these antibodies and devote more resources to strategies beyond removing amyloid.

### The anti-amyloid monoclonal antibody lecanemab: 16 cautionary notes [^112CT1Kg]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2023). Low credibility.

After the CLARITY-AD clinical trial results of lecanemab were interpreted as positive, supporting the amyloid hypothesis, the drug received accelerated Food and Drug Administration approval. However, we argue that the benefits of lecanemab treatment are uncertain and may yield net harm for some patients, and the data do not support the amyloid hypothesis. We note potential biases from inclusion, unblinding, dropouts, and other issues. Given substantial adverse effects and subgroup heterogeneity, we conclude that lecanemab's efficacy is not clinically meaningful, consistent with numerous analyses suggesting that amyloid-β and its derivatives are not the main causative agents of Alzheimer's disease dementia.

### Aricept odt [^115rKZbA]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

Aricept has been administered to over 600 patients with severe Alzheimer's disease during clinical trials lasting at least six months, including three double-blind, placebo-controlled trials, two of which had an open-label extension.

- **Adverse reactions leading to discontinuation**: The rates of discontinuation from controlled clinical trials of Aricept due to adverse reactions were approximately 12% for Aricept patients compared to 7% for placebo patients. The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation, defined as those occurring in at least 2% of Aricept patients and at twice or more the incidence seen in placebo, were anorexia (2% vs. 1% placebo), nausea (2% vs. < 1% placebo), diarrhea (2% vs. 0% placebo), and urinary tract infection (2% vs. 1% placebo).

- **Most common adverse reactions**: The most common adverse reactions, defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5% in patients receiving Aricept and at twice or more the placebo rate, are largely predicted by Aricept's cholinomimetic effects. These include diarrhea, anorexia, vomiting, nausea, and ecchymosis. These adverse reactions were often transient, resolving during continued Aricept treatment without the need for dose modification.

### Aricept ODT [^115xC6AM]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

The effectiveness of Aricept as a treatment for mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease is demonstrated by the results of two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical investigations in patients diagnosed by NINCDS and DSM III-R criteria, with a Mini-Mental State Examination score of ≥ 10 and ≤ 26 and a Clinical Dementia Rating of 1 or 2. The mean age of patients participating in Aricept trials was 73 years, with a range from 50 to 94. Approximately 62% of patients were women and 38% were men. The racial distribution was 95% white, 3% black, and 2% other races.

The higher dose of 10 mg did not provide a statistically significant greater clinical benefit than 5 mg. However, there is a suggestion based on order of group mean scores and dose trend analyses from these clinical trials that a daily dose of 10 mg of Aricept might provide additional benefit for some patients. Consequently, whether to employ a dose of 10 mg is a matter of prescriber and patient preference.

- **Study outcome measures**: In each study, the effectiveness of treatment with Aricept was evaluated using a dual outcome assessment strategy. The ability of Aricept to improve cognitive performance was assessed using the cognitive subscale of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-cog), a multi-item instrument extensively validated in longitudinal cohorts of Alzheimer's disease patients. The ADAS-cog examines selected aspects of cognitive performance, including elements of memory, orientation, attention, and reasoning.

### EFNS guidelines for the diagnosis and management of Alzheimer's disease [^113Lw1JM]. European Journal of Neurology (2010). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for Alzheimer's disease, more specifically concerning cholinesterase inhibitors, the EFNS 2010 guidelines suggest offering cholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil, galantamine, or rivastigmine) to patients with Alzheimer's disease at the time of diagnosis. This recommendation takes into account expected therapeutic benefits and potential safety issues. Benefits on cognitive and non-cognitive symptoms have been demonstrated in patients with mild, moderate, and severe disease.

### Biomarkers as endpoints in clinical trials for Alzheimer's disease [^115D9YP7]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2024). Low credibility.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that imposes an economic and societal burden. Biomarkers have played a crucial role in the recent approval of aducanumab and lecanemab as disease-modifying therapies, marking a significant milestone for the treatment of AD. The inclusion of biomarkers in AD trials facilitates precise diagnosis, monitors safety, demonstrates target engagement, and supports disease modification.

- **Objective**: This study analyzed the utilization state and trends of biomarkers as endpoints in AD trials.

- **Methods**: In this retrospective study, trials were collected by searching clinicaltrials.gov using the term "Alzheimer". Primary and secondary outcomes were analyzed separately for each phase.

- **Results**: Among the 1,048 analyzed trials, 313 (29.87%) adopted biomarkers as primary endpoints and 364 (34.73%) as secondary endpoints, mainly in phases 1 and 2. The top three biomarkers adopted as primary endpoints in phases 1, 2, and 3 were amyloid-PET, tau-PET, and MRI. The top three biomarkers adopted as secondary endpoints, in phase 1, were cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid-β (Aβ), blood Aβ, and amyloid-PET; in phase 2, they were MRI, CSF Aβ, and CSF phospho-tau; and in phase 3, they were amyloid PET, MRI, and blood Aβ. There was a statistically significant increase in the adoption of biomarkers as primary endpoints in phase 2 trials (p = 0.001) and secondary endpoints in phase 3 trials (p = 0.001).

- **Conclusions**: The growing recognition of the importance of biomarkers in AD trial design and drug development is evident by the significant strides made in recent years.

### Lecanemab approval in EU: What should we be ready for? - The EANM perspective [^1157e194]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2025). Low credibility.

Another advantage of amyloid PET, the marker of aggregated Aβ, is the ability to monitor response to anti-amyloid therapies. Fluid biomarkers, being sensitive to dynamic changes of amyloidopathy, are not recommended for monitoring amyloid load under disease-modifying therapies. Thus, amyloid PET rather than CSF Aβ proteins have been used as a secondary endpoint in clinical trials of anti-amyloid therapies so far.

As discussed previously, we foresee a relevant potential for repeated amyloid PET to guide therapy dosage and duration. In this context, adaptation of the centiloid scale to harmonize the quantification of amyloid PET images with different radiotracers is essential. In fact, the centiloid scale has been used to select and monitor patients in a prospective phase 3 trial of Donanemab, another promising anti-amyloid antibody, which is currently under review by the EMA. Specifically, Aβ load reduction was reevaluated using PET at 24 and 52 weeks.

Patients receiving Donanemab were transitioned to a placebo if PET quantification at these intervals met predetermined stopping criteria, which was achieved by 52% of patients in the treatment group. Considering the significant patient burden and costs of Aβ-targeting monoclonal antibodies, a limited duration of therapy could substantially improve cost-effectiveness. While the standard pipeline for calculation of the centiloid values seems to be robust, caution needs to be made regarding the potential influence of reconstruction PET parameters on the centiloid value.

### Association of amyloid reduction after donanemab treatment with tau pathology and clinical outcomes: The TRAILBLAZER-ALZ randomized clinical trial [^1153DTNW]. JAMA Neurology (2022). High credibility.

The biological definition of Alzheimer's disease includes the presence of β-amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tau deposits. The study aimed to perform post hoc analyses on the reduction of amyloid after donanemab treatment, assessing its association with tau pathology and clinical outcomes.

The TRAILBLAZER-ALZ trial, a phase 2, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial, was conducted from December 18, 2017, to December 4, 2020. This study included a double-blind period of up to 76 weeks and a follow-up period of 48 weeks. Conducted at 56 centers in the US and Canada, the trial enrolled participants aged 60 to 85 years who experienced gradual and progressive memory changes for 6 months or more. These participants showed early symptoms of Alzheimer's disease, elevated amyloid, and intermediate tau levels.

Donanemab, an antibody specific for the N-terminal pyroglutamate β-amyloid epitope, was administered every 4 weeks: 700 mg for the first 3 doses, followed by 1400 mg for up to 72 weeks. Blinded dose-reduction evaluations were conducted at 24 and 52 weeks based on amyloid clearance.

The main outcomes and measures focused on changes in amyloid levels, tau levels, and clinical decline following donanemab treatment. The study randomized 272 participants, with a mean age of 75.2 years (SD 5.5); 53.3% were female. Of the 1955 individuals screened, 1683 were excluded from participating. A moderate correlation was found between the rate of amyloid reduction from donanemab treatment at 24 weeks and the baseline quantity of amyloid (Spearman correlation coefficient r = -0.54; 95% CI, -0.6…).

### Potential impact of unblinding on observed treatment effects in Alzheimer's disease trials [^116qweAR]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2024). High credibility.

Adverse effects of monoclonal antibodies against amyloid beta are common and may affect the validity of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) through the unblinding of participants. We used observations from published phase 3 RCTs in Alzheimer's disease to calculate the magnitude of unblinding effects on cognition that would be required to explain observed cognitive benefits in RCTs.

In trials of lecanemab, aducanumab, and donanemab, the incidence of amyloid-related imaging abnormalities with active treatment ranged from 22% to 44%, the vast majority of which presumably led to unblinding. Effects of unblinding on the Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes required to fully explain observed drug effects ranged from 1.1 points (95% confidence interval: 0.2–2.0) with aducanumab, to 3.3 points (2.1–4.4) with donanemab and 3.7 points (2.0–5.6) with lecanemab. Infusion-related reactions were common, with potential unblinding effects particularly for lecanemab. Similar patterns were observed for the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale Cognitive subscale.

Psychological treatment effects due to unblinding may explain a substantial share of observed treatment effects in RCTs.

### Avoiding causal fraud in the evaluation of clinical benefits of treatments for Alzheimer's disease [^117F55gi]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Low credibility.

There is no consensus on how to define clinical meaningfulness most accurately and informatively for treatment outcomes in Alzheimer's disease (AD) trials. Since the publication of outcomes data from pivotal licensing trials of aducanumab, lecanemab, and donanemab — three US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved amyloid-lowering monoclonal antibody therapies for the treatment of AD — various approaches have been proposed to define and evaluate a clinically meaningful difference. Our view is that for parallel-arm AD randomized controlled trials (RCTs) using a continuous outcome measure, the most valid statistical approach is to look at the average between-group difference in (primary) outcome, which corresponds to the average variation between treatment and placebo groups and the true treatment effect above the placebo effect. Other indirectly derived approaches to present trial findings have serious statistical limitations or depend on as yet unsupported assumptions. For example, the "time saved with treatment" approach assumes a linear pattern of cognitive/functional decline in early AD stages, and the "percentage slowing" approach assumes the treatment has disease-modification properties and will confer cumulative benefit.

Another persistent approach has been to compare numbers or proportions of individuals in treatment and placebo groups who experienced a threshold-defined level of clinically meaningful change to show that the treatment was associated with a higher likelihood of meaningful change within individuals. The FDA has encouraged a movement toward…

### Considering challenges for the new Alzheimer's drugs: Clinical, population, and health system perspectives [^115x31T2]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2024). High credibility.

A clinical perspective reveals that after two decades of trials reporting successful amyloid clearance without symptomatic benefit, recent years have brought significant findings. Notably, two completed phase III randomized controlled trials of amyloid immunotherapy (lecanemab and donanemab) have reported statistically significant reductions in the rate of cognitive and functional decline compared to placebo. However, the absolute effect sizes are small and fall below the previously established thresholds of the minimum clinically important difference. Furthermore, approximately 80% of participants completed the trials, with a higher dropout rate in the intervention groups compared to the control groups. This discrepancy may have introduced bias in favor of the intervention arms, even considering the modified intention-to-treat analysis in the lecanemab trial, which included over 95% of participants.

The drugs are also linked to significant adverse events, most notably amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA). In the treatment arms, around 3 in every 10 individuals experienced brain edema (ARIA-E) and/or hemorrhage (ARIA-H), with incidences of 21.5% for lecanemab and 36.8% for donanemab compared to 9.5% and 14.9% in the placebo groups, respectively. These abnormalities were imaging-detected, with only one-quarter of those with edema being symptomatic, and few large hemorrhages. However, the long-term effects of these adverse events remain unknown. Adverse events led to treatment discontinuation in 6.9% of lecanemab and 13.1% of donanemab participants, compared to 2.9% and 4.3% in the placebo groups, respectively.

### Monoclonal antibodies for treating early Alzheimer disease-a commentary on recent 'positive' trials [^116sqDNi]. Age and Ageing (2024). Low credibility.

Recent phase 3 randomized controlled trials of amyloid-targeting monoclonal antibodies in people with pre-clinical or early Alzheimer disease have reported positive results, raising hope for the development of disease-modifying drugs. Given their far-reaching implications for clinical practice, the methods and findings of these trials, along with the disease causation theory underpinning the drug's mechanism of action, need to be critically appraised.

Key considerations include the representativeness of trial populations; balance of prognostic factors at baseline; psychometric properties and minimal clinically important differences of the primary efficacy outcome measures; level of study fidelity; consistency of subgroup analyses; replication of findings in similar trials; sponsor role and potential conflicts of interest; consistency of results with disease causation theory; cost and resource estimates; and alternative prevention and treatment strategies.

This commentary highlights shortcomings in each of these areas, concluding that monoclonal antibody treatment for early Alzheimer disease lacks high-quality evidence of clinically meaningful impacts at an affordable cost.

### Safety and efficacy of monoclonal antibodies for Alzheimer's disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis of published and unpublished clinical trials [^114agcJE]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2022). Low credibility.

The last Alzheimer's disease (AD) drug development pipeline indicated that disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) represent the majority of investigated agents, accounting for 82.5% of the total. Among the drugs categorized as DMTs, 16 (15.4%) are anti-amyloid beta (anti-Aβ) monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), and 11 (10.6%) are anti-tau mAbs.

Research on anti-Aβ agents has been ongoing for approximately 15 years. Despite this, the lack of demonstrated clinical benefits has hindered the approval for marketing, except for Biogen's aducanumab, which has been approved only by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The primary challenge related to amyloid-targeted agents is the insufficient evidence supporting a direct association between amyloid load and cognitive outcomes. Studies have reported merely an indirect connection between amyloid plaques and cognitive decline.

A significant concern with anti-Aβ mAbs in AD patients is the increased risk of vasogenic cerebral edema and cerebral micro-hemorrhages in those treated with mAbs. These abnormalities were initially identified via magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) during trials of one of the early mAbs, bapineuzumab. In 2011, a dedicated working group identified these events as amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA), specifically naming them ARIA-E (vasogenic edema) and ARIA-H (micro-hemorrhage). There is also an increased risk of both ARIA-E and ARIA-H in patients treated with other anti-Aβ mAbs.

### Amyloid antibody therapy for early-stage Alzheimer's disease: a critical review of three recent trials [^112RnHba]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Low credibility.

Pathogenic tau rather than amyloid deposition has been repeatedly reported as a cognitive decline correlate. Monoclonal amyloid-beta antibodies (ABA) target pathological amyloid beta aggregates, one of the multiple proposed drivers of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. Although clinical trials of ABAs have produced statistically significant outcomes, they are clinically unconvincing. This may reflect the role of tau as a cognitive decline correlate and the late application of ABAs in AD pathology. As a result, more recent ABA trials are targeting patients at an earlier stage of the disease to limit neurodegeneration before clinical manifestations. However, this is proving problematic as there is a lack of specific biomarkers for detecting true preclinical AD, monitoring treatment response, or quantifying disease progression.

Despite this, the race for disease-modifying therapies in AD is accelerating, with no new approved drugs until the recent initially accelerated FDA approvals of aducanumab and lecanemab. With blood-brain barrier (BBB) antibody penetrance at less than 0.01%, drug doses must be multiplied exponentially for sufficient absorption, creating economic viability concerns. Challenges in AD trials are complicated by a lack of consensus on clinical scoring systems and standards of dementia care. Remaining scientific barriers include an incomplete understanding of pathological drivers and mechanisms for drug delivery.

### Are lecanemab and donanemab disease-modifying therapies [^117NxgCF]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2024). Low credibility.

**Progressive, objective improvements in cognition**: Another criterion for disease modification is that clinical benefits accumulate over a longer time, arguably also after ending treatment. Amyloid buildup presumably takes many years, and once removed, would arguably require minimal further treatment to balance the small amounts of new amyloid formed. The absolute effect size (Cohen's d coefficient) at 18 months for the scale measuring the clinical performance of participants (Clinical Dementia Rate-Sum of Boxes, CDR-SB) is 0.21 in the lecanemab study and 0.23 in the donanemab study. These values are small and similar to symptomatic drugs. The claim that a more robust effect size takes a longer time to mature would require defining time cutoffs where drug superiority versus symptomatic drugs is predicted, in order to be scientifically falsifiable and to make disease modification clinically relevant to patients with limited lifespan.

### Amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA): Radiological, biological and clinical characteristics [^114ywitW]. Brain (2023). High credibility.

Excess accumulation and aggregation of toxic soluble and insoluble amyloid-β species in the brain are a major hallmark of Alzheimer's disease. Randomized clinical trials show reduced brain amyloid-β deposits using monoclonal antibodies that target amyloid-β and have identified MRI signal abnormalities called amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) as possible spontaneous or treatment-related adverse events. This review provides a comprehensive state-of-the-art conceptual review of radiological features, clinical detection and classification challenges, pathophysiology, underlying biological mechanism(s), and risk factors/predictors associated with ARIA.

We summarize the existing literature and lines of evidence with ARIA-oedema/effusion (ARIA-E) and ARIA-haemosiderosis/microhaemorrhages (ARIA-H) seen across anti-amyloid clinical trials and therapeutic development. Both forms of ARIA may occur, often early, during anti-amyloid-β monoclonal antibody treatment. Across randomized controlled trials, most ARIA cases were asymptomatic. Symptomatic ARIA-E cases often occurred at higher doses and resolved within 3–4 months or upon treatment cessation. Apolipoprotein E haplotype and treatment dosage are major risk factors for ARIA-E and ARIA-H. The presence of any microhaemorrhage on baseline MRI increases the risk of ARIA. ARIA shares many clinical, biological, and pathophysiological features with Alzheimer's disease and cerebral amyloid angiopathy. There is a great need to conceptually link the evident synergistic interplay associated with such underlying conditions.

### Leqembi [^11216ZYY]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Consider the benefit of Leqembi for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and the potential risk of serious adverse events associated with amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) when deciding to initiate treatment with Leqembi [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Clinical Studies (14)].

- **Warning: Amyloid related imaging abnormalities**: See full prescribing information for a complete boxed warning. Monoclonal antibodies directed against aggregated forms of beta-amyloid, including Leqembi, can cause amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA), characterized as ARIA with edema (ARIA-E) and ARIA with hemosiderin deposition (ARIA-H). ARIA is usually asymptomatic, although serious and life-threatening events can occur. ARIA can be fatal. Serious intracerebral hemorrhages greater than 1 cm have occurred in patients treated with this class of medications. ARIA-E can cause focal neurologic deficits that can mimic ischemic stroke [5.1, 6.1].

- **ApoE ε4 Homozygotes**: Patients treated with this class of medications, including Leqembi, who are ApoE ε4 homozygotes have a higher incidence of ARIA, including symptomatic and serious ARIA, compared to heterozygotes and noncarriers. Testing for ApoE ε4 status should be performed prior to the initiation of treatment to inform the risk of developing ARIA. Prior to testing, prescribers should discuss with patients the risk of ARIA across genotypes and the implications of genetic testing results [5.1].

Consider the benefit of Leqembi for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and the potential risk of serious adverse events associated with ARIA when deciding to initiate treatment with Leqembi.

### Aricept ODT [^112NhJSS]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

The effectiveness of Aricept in the treatment of patients with moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease was established in studies employing doses of 10 mg/day and 23 mg/day. Results of a controlled clinical trial in moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease that compared Aricept 23 mg once daily to 10 mg once daily suggest that a 23 mg dose of Aricept provided additional benefit.

- **Swedish 6 month study (10 mg/day)**: The effectiveness of Aricept as a treatment for severe Alzheimer's disease is demonstrated by the results of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study conducted in Sweden (6-month study) in patients with probable or possible Alzheimer's disease diagnosed by NINCDS-ADRDA and DSM-IV criteria, with an MMSE range of 1–10. Two hundred forty-eight patients with severe Alzheimer's disease were randomized to Aricept or placebo. For patients randomized to Aricept, treatment was initiated at 5 mg once daily for 28 days and then increased to 10 mg once daily. At the end of the 6-month treatment period, 90.5% of the Aricept-treated patients were receiving the 10 mg/day dose. The mean age of patients was 84.9 years, with a range of 59 to 99. Approximately 77% of patients were women, and 23% were men. Almost all patients were Caucasian. Probable Alzheimer's disease was diagnosed in the majority of the patients (83.6% of Aricept-treated patients and 84.2% of placebo-treated patients).

### Considering challenges for the new Alzheimer's drugs: Clinical, population, and health system perspectives [^112SsWrf]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2024). High credibility.

- **A population perspective**: The trials included those with "early symptomatic Alzheimer's disease" — either mild dementia or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) with evidence of raised amyloid levels and, in the donanemab trial, additional evidence of raised tau. The MCI group, that is, those with cognitive impairment but no accompanying functional limitation, was included because they represent the earliest symptomatic point in the hypothesized cascade and have a reasonably high likelihood of progression to dementia, as a pooled analysis of 12 cohorts found that 59% progressed within 3 years. However, selection biases in these cohorts likely mean this is an overestimate of the overall rate in the population.

- **Exclusion criteria**: The trials excluded those who had evidence of co‐neuropathologies (e.g. significant vascular pathology on MRI scan) which may have been contributing to their symptoms (minor co‐pathology was allowed), and those with co‐morbidities (e.g. depression, recent stroke, or cancer) which might increase the risk of trial noncompletion. It is appropriate to set stringent eligibility criteria in a phase III trial designed to elicit efficacy (the best possible effect an intervention can achieve if conditions are set to its advantage). Nevertheless, it is important to consider who is represented in these trials in order to inform who should be offered these drugs if they are licensed (outside of the United States) and rolled out.

- **Note on table**: Characteristics of participants in and exclusion criteria for the phase III trials of aducanumab, lecanemab, and donanemab have been summarized above.

### Ariceptodt [^113RRmGX]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

The patients recruited as participants in each study had mean scores on the ADAS-cog of approximately 26 points, with a range from 4 to 61. Experience based on longitudinal studies of ambulatory patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease suggests that scores on the ADAS-cog increase (worsen) by 6 to 12 points per year. However, smaller changes may be seen in patients with very mild or very advanced disease since the ADAS-cog is not uniformly sensitive to change over the course of the disease. The annualized rate of decline in the placebo patients participating in Aricept trials was approximately 2 to 4 points per year.

- **Clinician assessment**: The ability of Aricept to produce an overall clinical effect was assessed using a Clinician's Interview-Based Impression of Change that required the use of caregiver information, the CIBIC-plus. The CIBIC-plus is not a single instrument and is not standardized like the ADAS-cog. Clinical trials for investigational drugs have used a variety of CIBIC formats, each differing in terms of depth and structure.

As such, results from a CIBIC-plus reflect clinical experience from the trial or trials in which it was used and cannot be compared directly with the results of CIBIC-plus evaluations from other clinical trials. The CIBIC-plus used in Aricept trials was a semi-structured instrument intended to examine four major areas of patient function: general, cognitive, behavioral, and activities of daily living. It represents the assessment of a skilled clinician based upon their observations at an interview with the patient, in combination.

### How donanemab data address the coverage with evidence development questions [^111BaVk4]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2024). High credibility.

The results of TRAILBLAZER-ALZ clinical trials of donanemab provide robust evidence that addresses the three CED questions outlined in the CMS NCD for mAbs directed against amyloid for the treatment of AD. First, in the Phase 3 TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 trial, donanemab meaningfully improved health outcomes (i.e. slowed cognitive and functional decline) for participants with early symptomatic AD in broad community practice. Donanemab significantly slowed cognitive and functional decline by more than one-third versus placebo at 18 months, with consistent and equally robust efficacy across all secondary endpoints. Across all efficacy outcome measures, donanemab met or exceeded the 20% to 30% benchmark often referenced for clinical meaningfulness.

In addition, concerted efforts were undertaken to ensure that TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 participants were reflective of the Medicare population. This included using inclusion/exclusion criteria that permitted participants with comorbidities and medication use common in the Medicare population and a broad range of providers as participating investigators, including specialists in neurology, psychiatry, primary care, geriatrics, endocrinology, and other disciplines.

Donanemab significantly slowed cognitive and functional decline across all key participant subgroups and had the greatest effect in participants with earlier stage disease. Robust evidence from the TRAILBLAZER-ALZ clinical development program supports that donanemab should not be restricted based on treating clinician or treatment setting; approximately 90% of TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 sites.

### Anti-amyloid antibody treatments for Alzheimer's disease [^116Hzrwh]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Low credibility.

The accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques in the brain is considered an early event in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), followed by the hyperphosphorylation of tau protein. These pathological hallmarks lead to neuronal dysfunction, inflammation, and ultimately neuronal death. While these core pathological features of AD are well established, their exact role in disease progression is still under investigation. It remains unclear whether the accumulation of Aβ plaques and tau protein is a cause or consequence of the disease. Nevertheless, targeting the accumulation of Aβ in the brain is currently the most prevalent approach to AD disease-modifying treatments.

Diagnosing AD can be challenging, as the symptoms resemble those of other forms of dementia, and very early clinical signs overlap with physiological cognitive changes due to older age. Traditionally, the diagnosis of AD was based on clinical criteria, including a progressive amnestic syndrome and impairment of normal daily activities. However, the accuracy of clinical diagnoses is limited, with at least 20% of patients diagnosed with AD based on clinical criteria having no underlying AD pathology. Biomarkers for AD have been developed to aid in diagnosis and monitor disease progression. Currently available biomarkers include cerebrospinal fluid Aβ and tau protein levels, as well as Aβ and tau positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. These biomarkers have shown promise in identifying individuals with underlying AD pathology, including in early stages.

### Pharmacologic and nutritional interventions for early Alzheimer's disease: A systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^116pYBsw]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2024). High credibility.

Early intervention is essential for meaningful disease modification in Alzheimer's disease (AD).

- **Objective**: We aimed to determine the efficacy and safety of pharmacologic and nutritional interventions for early AD.

- **Methods**: PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched from database inception until 1 September 2023. We included randomized controlled trials that evaluated the efficacy of interventions in early AD. Only interventions that demonstrated efficacy compared to placebo were included in the network meta-analysis (NMA). Then, we performed frequentist fixed-effects NMA to rank the interventions. GRADE criteria were used to evaluate the level of evidence.

- **Results**: Fifty-eight trials, including a total of 33,864 participants and 48 interventions, were eligible for inclusion. Among the 48 interventions analyzed, only 6 (12.5%) treatments — ranging from low to high certainty — showed significant improvement in cognitive decline compared to placebo. High certainty evidence indicated that donanemab (standardized mean difference [SMD] -0.239, 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.343 to -0.134) and lecanemab (SMD -0.194, 95% CI -0.279 to -0.108) moderately slowed the clinical progression in patients with amyloid pathology. Additionally, methylphenidate, donepezil, LipiDiDiet, and aducanumab with low certainty showed significant improvement in cognitive decline compared to placebo. However, there was no significant difference in serious adverse events as reported between the six interventions and placebo.

- **Conclusions**: Only 12.5% of interventions…

### Leqembi [^111s68Pv]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Leqembi treatment met the primary endpoint and reduced clinical decline on the global cognitive and functional scale, CDR-SB, compared to placebo at 18 months (-0.45 [-27%], P < 0.0001).

Statistically significant differences (P < 0.01) between treatment groups were also seen in the results for ADAS-Cog14 and ADCS MCI-ADL at 18 months, as presented in Table 8.

Both ApoE ε4 carriers and ApoE ε4 noncarriers showed statistically significant treatment differences for the primary endpoint and all secondary endpoints. In an exploratory subgroup analysis of ApoE ε4 homozygotes, which represented 15% of the trial population, a treatment effect was not observed with Leqembi treatment on the primary endpoint, CDR-SB, compared to placebo, although treatment effects that favored Leqembi were observed for the secondary clinical endpoints, ADAS-Cog14 and ADCS MCI-ADL. Treatment effects on disease-relevant biomarkers (amyloid beta PET, plasma Aβ42/40 ratio, plasma p-tau 181) also favored Leqembi in the ApoE ε4 homozygous subgroup.

Starting at six months, across all time points, Leqembi treatment showed statistically significant changes in the primary and all key secondary endpoints from baseline compared to placebo; see Figure 2.

### Benefits and risks of FDA-approved amyloid-targeting antibodies for treatment of early Alzheimer's disease: Navigating clinician-patient engagement [^112wUGJg]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2024). High credibility.

Explain to patients and families that, while therapies are not a cure, the course of the disease may be changed. Treatment may provide more time, and there is mounting evidence that the benefits of disease-slowing treatment may persist even after the treatment is discontinued, while other therapies are being developed. Amyloid-targeting therapies are the start of a new era in Alzheimer's disease (AD) treatment, and in the future, a combination of different therapies — and/or other new therapies — may be used to slow the progression of the disease even more. Furthermore, as we continue to gain more experience on the long-term effects of these FDA-approved amyloid-targeting therapies, we may be able to personalize dosing to the extent that we reduce treatment-associated risks and burdens but maintain treatment efficacy. As the field learns how to individualize therapy, the latest plasma markers may help guide optimal long-term treatment to maximize benefit, even after the treatment is discontinued.

- **Group benefit versus individual benefit**: Inform patients and their caregivers that the results of clinical trials show the average benefit for a group of patients. In practice, we have noticed that some people may benefit more or less than others, and we are going to learn more in the future as more patients start taking these treatments.

### A framework for best practices and readiness in the advent of anti-amyloid therapy for early Alzheimer's disease in Asia [^112JZsR5]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2024). Low credibility.

Advances in biomarker-based diagnostic modalities and the recent approval of anti-amyloid monoclonal antibodies for early Alzheimer's disease (AD; mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia due to AD) and the late-stage clinical development of other disease-modifying therapies for AD necessitate a significant paradigm shift in the early detection, diagnosis, and management of AD. Anti-amyloid monoclonal antibodies target the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of AD and have demonstrated a significant reduction in the rate of clinical decline in cognitive and functional outcome measures in patients with early AD.

With growing recognition of the benefits of early interventions in AD, an increasing number of people may seek diagnosis for their subjective cognitive problems in an already busy medical system. Various factors, such as limited examination time, lack of expertise for cognitive assessment, and limited access to specialized tests, can impact diagnostic accuracy and timely detection of AD. To overcome these challenges, a new model of care will be required.

In this paper, we provide practical guidance for institutional readiness for anti-amyloid therapies for early AD in Asia, in terms of best practices for identifying eligible patients and diagnosing them appropriately, safe administration of anti-amyloid monoclonal antibodies and monitoring of treatment, managing potential adverse events such as infusion reactions and amyloid-related imaging abnormalities, and cross-disciplinary collaboration. Education and training will be the cornerstone for the establishment of new pathways.

### Clinically important benefits and harms of monoclonal antibodies targeting amyloid for the treatment of Alzheimer disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^115Doipa]. Annals of Family Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

We conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate clinically meaningful benefits and harms of monoclonal antibodies targeting amyloid in patients with Alzheimer dementia.

- **Methods**: We searched PubMed, Cochrane CENTRAL, and five trial registries, as well as the reference lists of identified studies. We included randomized controlled trials comparing a monoclonal antibody with placebo at a dose consistent with that used in phase 3 trials or for Food and Drug Administration approval. Studies had to report at least one clinically relevant benefit or harm. Data were extracted independently by at least two researchers for random effects meta-analysis. Changes in cognitive and functional scales were compared between groups, and each difference was assessed to determine if it met the minimal clinically important difference (MCID).

- **Results**: We identified 19 publications with 23,202 total participants that evaluated eight anti-amyloid antibodies. There were small improvements over placebo in the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS)-Cog-11 to -14 score (standardized mean difference = -0.07; 95% CI, -0.10 to -0.04), Mini Mental State Examination score (0.32 points; 95% CI, 0.13 to 0.50), and Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes scale score (mean difference = -0.18 points; 95% CI, -0.34 to -0.03), and the combined functional scores (standardized mean difference = 0.09; 95% CI, 0.05 to 0.13). None of the changes, including those for lecanemab, aducanumab, and donanemab, exceeded the MCID. Harms included significantly increased risks of amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA)-edema.

### Uptravi [^1159Vt7t]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

In long-term follow-up of patients treated with Uptravi in the pivotal study and the open-label extension (N = 574), Kaplan-Meier estimates of survival across the GRIPHON study and the long-term extension study at 1, 2, 5, and 7 years were 92%, 85%, 71%, and 63%, respectively. The median exposure to Uptravi was 3 years. These uncontrolled observations do not allow comparison with a control group not given Uptravi and cannot be used to determine the long-term effect of Uptravi on mortality.

### Anti-amyloid antibody treatments for Alzheimer's disease [^113j8xww]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). High credibility.

Another promising anti-Aβ antibody in development was gantenerumab. Gantenerumab targets aggregated forms of Aβ, similar to aducanumab, but binds to a different part of the Aβ protein. In the initial phase 3 clinical trial, gantenerumab failed to show significant benefits in patients with early AD. However, a subset analysis suggested that patients with milder forms of AD may have benefited from the drug. Therefore, Roche decided to conduct two new phase 3 clinical trials using higher doses of gantenerumab. In November 2022, the results of the GRADUATE 1 and 2 trials were announced, indicating that gantenerumab failed to meet the primary end-point, and no further studies are planned.

Several other anti-Aβ antibodies are currently in development for AD. One of these is donanemab, which targets a specific conformation of Aβ that is present in the earliest stages of plaque formation, before plaques become visible on brain imaging. In a phase 2 clinical trial, donanemab reduced Aβ plaques in the brain and showed a statistically significant slowing of cognitive decline in patients with early AD. On 3 May 2023, the top-line results of the phase 3 trial were announced, stating that donanemab treatment versus placebo slowed clinical deterioration by 35% and a decline of activities of daily living by 40%. All secondary end-points were also met. Full results have since been published, indicating that donanemab significantly slowed clinical progression at 76 weeks in those with low/medium tau load on PET and in the combined low/medium and high tau pathology.
