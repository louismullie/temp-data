## Question

If iron, ferritin, and TIBC are normal will transferrin be normal too

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether transferrin will be normal if serum iron, ferritin, and TIBC are all normal. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the physiologic relationship between transferrin and TIBC. Then, I should verify how transferrin saturation is calculated and whether it depends on transferrin concentration. Next, I will consider whether normal iron and ferritin alone constrain transferrin to be normal. After that, I should review exceptions where transferrin could be abnormal despite normal iron, ferritin, and TIBC. Finally, I will synthesize a conclusion and note practical implications for interpretation of iron studies.

> Let me first confirm the core physiology. Transferrin is the iron-binding glycoprotein in plasma, and TIBC is a functional surrogate that reflects the total iron-binding capacity of transferrin in circulation. In practice, TIBC is often measured or calculated from serum iron and unsaturated iron-binding capacity, so a normal TIBC generally implies a normal transferrin concentration, assuming standard assay relationships and no analytical confounders [^1119Ki27].

> Wait, let me verify the calculation point. Transferrin saturation (TSAT) is computed as serum iron divided by TIBC, which means TSAT reflects the fractional occupancy of transferrin's iron-binding sites. TSAT does not directly measure transferrin concentration, so a normal TSAT does not guarantee a normal transferrin level, even though it is commonly interpreted alongside ferritin to assess iron status [^1119Ki27].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. If TIBC is normal, transferrin is typically normal because TIBC tracks transferrin's binding capacity; however, I should double-check for exceptions where transferrin could be abnormal despite a normal TIBC, such as rare transferrin variants or assay interference, or situations where transferrin concentration and TIBC diverge due to altered iron-binding affinity or analytical issues, even though these are uncommon in routine practice [^1119Ki27] [^112MALUZ].

> I need to ensure I'm not overgeneralizing from ferritin and iron alone. Ferritin reflects stores and is an acute-phase reactant, and serum iron fluctuates with diurnal and recent intake effects; neither ferritin nor serum iron directly constrains transferrin concentration, so normal values for those two do not by themselves prove normal transferrin, even though they often coexist in steady-state physiology [^1157g8j4].

> Let me consider the clinical context. In most outpatient settings without inflammation or liver disease, normal iron, ferritin, and TIBC make it highly likely that transferrin is normal, and guidelines that operationalize iron assessment using ferritin and TSAT implicitly rely on this relationship. Still, if the clinical picture and other indices are discordant, measuring transferrin directly can resolve ambiguity, particularly in complex inflammatory states or when hereditary iron disorders are suspected [^116PBzzy] [^112knLuE].

> But wait, what if there is a genetic variant affecting transferrin? Rare transferrin gene variants can lower TIBC and predispose to iron deficiency, so in principle a transferrin abnormality could exist with otherwise unremarkable iron studies; however, such cases are exceptional and would usually present with low TIBC rather than a normal TIBC, reinforcing that a normal TIBC is a strong proxy for normal transferrin in routine care [^113s4B7D].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the bottom line. Yes, if serum iron, ferritin, and TIBC are all normal, transferrin is almost certainly normal, because TIBC closely reflects transferrin's iron-binding capacity. However, rare analytical or genetic exceptions exist, so persistent clinical discordance warrants direct transferrin measurement or reassessment of the iron panel in context [^1119Ki27] [^112MALUZ].

---

If iron, ferritin, and TIBC are normal, **transferrin is typically normal** because TIBC directly reflects transferrin concentration [^1119Ki27]. Transferrin is the main iron-binding protein, and TIBC is a surrogate for transferrin levels; thus, a normal TIBC implies normal transferrin. However, rare genetic variants or assay interference can cause discordance, so **transferrin may be abnormal in exceptional cases** despite normal iron, ferritin, and TIBC [^113s4B7D] [^112MALUZ].

---

## Physiological relationship between transferrin and TIBC

Transferrin is the **primary iron-binding protein** in plasma, responsible for transporting iron from absorption sites to tissues. TIBC is a laboratory measure of the maximum amount of iron that can bind to transferrin in plasma, serving as a surrogate marker for transferrin concentration [^1119Ki27]. Under normal physiological conditions, transferrin concentration and TIBC are directly correlated; therefore, a normal TIBC generally indicates a normal transferrin concentration [^114E6d6R].

---

## Clinical implications of normal iron, ferritin, and TIBC

When iron, ferritin, and TIBC are within normal ranges, this typically indicates normal **iron metabolism** and **transferrin function**. Normal iron and ferritin suggest adequate circulating iron and **iron stores**, while a normal TIBC implies sufficient transferrin to transport iron. Collectively, these findings support normal transferrin levels and function [^1119Ki27].

---

## Exceptions and special considerations

While normal iron, ferritin, and TIBC generally indicate normal transferrin, **rare exceptions** may occur:

- **Genetic variants**: Rare genetic mutations affecting transferrin synthesis or function can lead to abnormal transferrin levels despite normal TIBC, iron, and ferritin. For example, the G277S mutation in the transferrin gene has been associated with reduced TIBC and altered iron-binding capacity [^113s4B7D].

- **Laboratory assay interference**: Analytical errors or interference in laboratory assays can occasionally produce discrepant results, leading to apparent abnormalities in transferrin or TIBC measurements.

- **Acute phase reactions**: Although TIBC is generally stable, acute phase reactions can influence transferrin synthesis and iron-binding capacity, potentially causing transient abnormalities.

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Clinical guidelines emphasize the **integrated interpretation** of iron studies, including serum iron, ferritin, TIBC, and transferrin saturation, to assess iron status accurately [^112GTN81]. Transferrin saturation (TSAT), calculated as serum iron divided by TIBC, is a useful indicator of iron availability and is commonly used alongside ferritin to diagnose iron deficiency or overload [^1119Ki27]. In clinical practice, normal iron, ferritin, and TIBC levels are generally sufficient to infer normal transferrin levels, and additional transferrin measurements are not routinely required unless specific clinical concerns arise [^notfound].

## Relationship between iron studies and transferrin

| **Parameter** | **Normal range** | **Clinical significance** | **Relationship to transferrin** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Serum iron | 60–170 µg/dL | Reflects circulating iron | Normal levels suggest adequate iron for transferrin transport |
| Ferritin | 15–150 ng/mL | Reflects iron stores | Normal levels indicate adequate iron stores and normal transferrin function |
| TIBC | 250–370 µg/dL | Surrogate for transferrin concentration | Normal TIBC indicates normal transferrin levels |
| Transferrin | 200–400 mg/dL | Primary iron-binding protein | Normal when iron, ferritin, and TIBC are normal |

---

In summary, **normal iron, ferritin, and TIBC generally indicate normal transferrin** because TIBC reflects transferrin concentration. Rare genetic variants or assay interference can cause exceptions, but these are uncommon.

5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

Iron overload: Monitor ferritin and TSAT. Patients may require a reduction in dose or discontinuation of intravenous iron. (5.1)
Accidental overdose of iron-containing products is a leading cause of fatal poisoning in children under 6 years of age. Keep this product out of reach of children. In case of accidental overdose, call a doctor or poison control center immediately. (5.2)

5.1 Iron Overload

Iron absorption from ferric citrate tablets may lead to excessive elevations in iron stores. Increases in serum ferritin and transferrin saturation (TSAT) levels were observed in clinical trials. In a 56-week safety and efficacy trial evaluating the control of serum phosphate levels in patients with chronic kidney disease on dialysis in which concomitant use of intravenous iron was permitted, 55 (19%) of patients treated with ferric citrate tablets had a ferritin level > 1500 ng/mL as compared with 13 (9%) of patients treated with active control.

Assess iron parameters (e.g., serum ferritin and TSAT) prior to initiating ferric citrate tablets and monitor iron parameters while on therapy [see Contraindications (4), Overdosage (10) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. Patients receiving intravenous iron may require a reduction in dose or discontinuation of intravenous iron therapy.

5.2 Risk of Overdosage in Children Due to Accidental Ingestion

Accidental ingestion and resulting overdose of iron-containing products is a leading cause of fatal poisoning in children under 6 years of age [see Overdosage (10)]. Advise patients of the risks to children and to keep ferric citrate tablets out of the reach of children.

### Critical re-evaluation of the identification of iron deficiency States and effective iron repletion strategies in patients with chronic heart failure [^111Ws2Lt]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2024). Medium credibility.

According to current guidelines, iron deficiency is defined by a serum ferritin level < 100ng/ml or a transferrin saturation (TSAT) < 20% if the serum ferritin level is 100–299μg/L. These criteria were developed to encourage the use of intravenous iron as an adjunct to erythropoiesis-stimulating agents in the treatment of renal anaemia. However, in patients with heart failure, these criteria are not supported by any pathophysiological or clinical evidence that they identify an absolute or functional iron deficiency state. A low baseline TSAT-but not serum ferritin level-appears to be a reliable indicator of the effect of intravenous iron to reduce major heart failure events. In randomized controlled trials, intravenous iron decreased the risk of cardiovascular death or total heart failure hospitalization in patients with a TSAT < 20% (risk ratio 0.67 [0.49–0.92]) but not in patients with a TSAT ≥ 20% (risk ratio 0.99 [0.74–1.30]), with the magnitude of the risk reduction being proportional to the severity of hypoferraemia. Patients who were enrolled in clinical trials solely because they had a serum ferritin level < 100μg/L showed no significant benefit on heart failure outcomes, and it is noteworthy that serum ferritin levels of 20–300μg/L lie entirely within the range of normal values for healthy adults. Current guidelines reflect the eligibility criteria of clinical trials, which inadvertently adopted unvalidated criteria to define iron deficiency. Reliance on these guidelines would lead to the treatment of many patients who are not iron deficient (serum ferritin level < 100μg/L but normal TSAT) and ignores the possibility of iron deficiency in patients with a low TSAT but with serum ferritin level of > 300μg/L. Importantly, analyses of benefit based on trial eligibility-driven guidelines substantially underestimate the magnitude of heart-failure-event risk reduction with intravenous iron in patients who are truly iron deficient. Based on all available data, we recommend a new mechanism-based and trial-tested approach that reflects the totality of evidence more faithfully than the historical process adopted by clinical investigators and by the guidelines. Until additional evidence is forthcoming, an iron deficiency state in patients with heart failure should be defined by a TSAT < 20% (as long as the serum ferritin level is < 400μg/L), and furthermore, the use of a serum ferritin level < 100μg/L alone as a diagnostic criterion should be discarded.

Cyanosis in adult congenital heart disease (ACHD) — definition, evaluation, and iron management: The definition of cyanosis is "bluish discoloration of the skin and/or mucous membranes resulting from inadequate oxygenation of the blood", and for cyanosis to be visible, at least 5 g/L of unsaturated hemoglobin in tissue is needed. Cyanotic heart disease encompasses a widely heterogeneous group; therefore, an individualized approach is needed for each patient according to the clinical details. Secondary erythrocytosis and polycythemia are fundamentally different conditions that require different treatments. Iron deficiency is frequently encountered in cyanotic individuals; consequences may include stroke and myocardial ischemia, and iron deficiency requires assessment of serum iron, ferritin, and transferrin levels because mean corpuscular volume is not a reliable screening test. Limited data suggest that treatment of transferrin saturation < 20% with iron supplementation until iron stores are replete can be done safely.

### Evaluation and management of iron deficiency in children undergoing intestinal rehabilitation – A position paper from the NASPGHAN intestinal rehabilitation special interest group [^114ZRpr7]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2023). High credibility.

NASPGHAN intestinal rehabilitation recommendations — screening and practical management in children: In children with suspected altered gastrointestinal motility (gastroparesis, pediatric intestinal pseudo-obstruction [PIPO]) or a history of gastrojejunal bypass or persistently draining gastrostomy tube (G tube), we recommend clamping the G tube for 30 minutes after enteral iron administration into the gastric port for improved absorption. Screening for iron deficiency (ID)/iron deficiency anemia (IDA) in children undergoing IR should not be based on a hemoglobin (Hb) and mean corpuscular volume (MCV) alone; we recommend screening for IDA based on complete blood count (CBC), serum ferritin (SF), transferrin saturation (TSAT), serum iron concentration, and total iron-binding capacity (TIBC), and a C-reactive protein (CRP) should be obtained while screening for ID as SF is an acute phase reactant. Children undergoing IR should be screened for ID/IDA and we recommend screening every 3–6 months. Vitamin B12, zinc, and copper deficiency should be evaluated based on anatomic risk and in children not responding to conventional treatment. While assessing iron status in children undergoing IR, we recommend categorizing children into 3 categories: children without ID; children with ID without anemia; and children with IDA to enable informed decision making.

### Diagnosis and management of hemochromatosis: 2011 practice guideline by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^111iUVEE]. Hepatology (2011). Medium credibility.

Hemochromatosis — initial diagnostic markers and transferrin saturation (TS) thresholds are outlined: the initial approach to diagnosis is by indirect markers of iron stores, namely TS or unsaturated iron-binding capacity and serum ferritin, and a recent study using fasting samples showed no improvement in sensitivity or specificity in the detection of C282Y homozygotes; accordingly, this prior recommendation is no longer absolutely necessary, although it is advisable to confirm an elevated TS with a second determination and it is not unreasonable in our opinion to do this on a fasting specimen. Although a cutoff TS value of 45% is often chosen for its high sensitivity for detecting C282Y homozygotes, it has a lower specificity and positive predictive value compared to higher cutoff values, and using a cutoff TS of 45% will also identify persons with minor secondary iron overload as well as some C282Y/wild-type heterozygotes, requiring further evaluation.

### Dietary nonheme iron is equally bioavailable from ferritin or ferrous sulfate in thalassemia intermedia [^1118TrGd]. Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (2017). Low credibility.

Transfusion-independent patients with thalassemia intermedia (TI) develop fatal iron overload from excessive iron absorption triggered by ineffective erythropoiesis. More information about iron pharmacokinetics and nonheme, dietary iron absorption in such patients is needed to optimize management. To obtain more information, different forms of supplemental nonheme iron sources (ferritin and ferrous sulfate) were compared in 4 TI (hemoglobin < 9 g/dL) and 6 control (hemoglobin 12–16 g/dL) patients. Serial serum iron concentrations were measured during the 24 hours following consumption of 1 mg/kg of elemental iron as ferritin or ferrous sulfate. Serum iron concentrations were also measured for one TI patient and one control patient 2 hours after the ingestion of 2 mg/kg of dietary iron in ferritin or ferrous sulfate. Maximum serum iron concentrations were observed 4 hours after the consumption of either dietary iron source. However, the serum iron values were unchanged for either dietary iron source, even at the higher doses of consumed iron. Thus, the bioavailability of dietary iron, either as ferritin or ferrous sulfate, was equivalent in both groups of patients. The pilot data support ferritin as an alternative dietary iron supplement to ferrous sulfate.

### Anemia in children with inflammatory bowel disease: a position paper by the IBD committee of the north American society of pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology and nutrition [^115aEBrk]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2020). High credibility.

Anemia in children with inflammatory bowel disease — nonanemic iron deficiency (NAID) can be detected by routine screening and, in children, a ferritin level below 15 μg/L is considered diagnostic for iron deficiency, whereas in active disease levels of up to 100 μg/L can still be consistent with iron-deficient state; a low transferrin saturation (< 20%) coupled with a low ferritin will be observed with iron deficiency, while high ferritin and low TSAT will be observed in functional iron deficiency even without anemia, and early changes include a high RDW and low or borderline MCH.

### Treatment of restless legs syndrome and periodic limb movement disorder: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline [^115tkuwR]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Restless legs syndrome (RLS) good practice statement — iron testing and management: In all patients with clinically significant RLS, clinicians should regularly test serum iron studies including ferritin and transferrin saturation (calculated from iron and total iron binding capacity), with testing ideally administered in the morning avoiding all iron-containing supplementation and foods at least 24 hours prior to blood draw. Consensus guidelines suggest that supplementation of iron in adults with RLS should be instituted with oral or intravenous (IV) iron if serum ferritin ≤ 75 ng/mL or transferrin saturation < 20%, and only with IV iron if serum ferritin is between 75 and 100 ng/mL; in children, supplementation of iron should be instituted for serum ferritin < 50 ng/mL with oral or IV formulations. The first step in the management of RLS should be addressing exacerbating factors, and RLS is common in pregnancy; prescribers should consider the pregnancy-specific safety profile of each treatment being considered.

### AGA clinical practice update on diet and nutritional therapies in patients with inflammatory bowel disease: expert review [^113vJuQi]. Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Inflammatory bowel disease — iron deficiency anemia screening and treatment: all patients with IBD are at risk for anemia. For laboratory screening, a complete blood count, serum ferritin, transferrin saturation, and C-reactive protein should be used. For patients in remission or mild disease, measurements are suggested every 6–12 months, and in active disease it is suggested to repeat screening every 3 months. In the presence of iron deficiency, iron supplementation is advised; intravenous iron is considered more effective and often better tolerated than oral iron, oral iron repletion is reasonable in mild anemia or clinically inactive disease, and dosing is based on baseline hemoglobin and body weight.

### Screening for iron deficiency anemia in young children: USPSTF recommendation statement [^114aKFku]. Pediatrics (2015). Medium credibility.

Screening tests for iron deficiency anemia in infants and young children — test performance and limitations indicate that serum hemoglobin or hematocrit is the primary screening test for iron deficiency anemia, but hemoglobin is not sensitive for detecting iron deficiency and is also nonspecific, as ~60% of cases of anemia result from causes other than iron deficiency. The positive predictive value of low hemoglobin for iron deficiency in children age 12 months ranges from 10% to 40%, and in infants, particularly before age 12 months, spontaneous resolution of iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia reduces the positive predictive value of any screening test. Other single tests as primary screening tools have not been well studied, and serum ferritin acts as an acute-phase reactant and should ideally be measured in the absence of infection or inflammation.

### Comparison of plasma ferritin concentration with the ratio of plasma transferrin receptor to ferritin in estimating body iron stores: results of 4 intervention trials [^116wctTB]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Efforts to develop global programs for the control of iron deficiency require simple, low-cost, and accurate indicators of iron status.

Objective

We aimed to compare estimates of body iron (BI) stores, as calculated from either plasma ferritin concentration alone (BI-ferritin) or the ratio of plasma transferrin receptor (TfR) to ferritin (BI-TfR/ferritin).

Design

Data were analyzed from 4 previously completed, randomized intervention trials that enrolled infants, schoolchildren, or pregnant women (total n = 1189, after excluding subjects with elevated C-reactive protein).

Results

The correlation coefficients between BI-ferritin and BI-TfR/ferritin were > 0.95 for all studies. The kappa index ranged from 0.5 to 1.0. All of the sensitivities of BI-ferritin for identifying persons with low iron stores (defined as BI-TfR/ferritin < 0 mg/kg body wt) were > 0.90. All of the specificities were > 0.90 except the study of pregnant women (specificity = 0.66). The effect sizes of iron intervention trials were significantly greater for change in iron reserves estimated by BI-TfR/ferritin than by BI-ferritin in 2 studies with larger effect sizes (1.11 compared with 1.00 and 1.56 compared with 1.44, respectively; P < 0.05) and 1 study with medium effect size (0.70 compared with 0.57; P < 0.05). However, there were no significant differences between estimates of these effect sizes for 1 study with a medium effect size and 1 study with a smaller effect size (0.78 compared with 0.83 and 0.37 compared with 0.35, respectively; P > 0.2).

Conclusion

Plasma ferritin concentration alone provides a good approximation of total BI reserves, as estimated by BI-TfR/ferritin, on the basis of high correlation, sensitivity, and specificity among nonpregnant persons with unelevated C-reactive protein.

### The usefulness of serum transferrin receptor for discriminating iron deficiency without anemia in children [^112gHcD4]. Haematologica (2006). Low credibility.

We determined serum transferrin receptor (sTfR), serum erythropoietin and hematologic and biochemical iron parameters in 251 healthy children. The levels of sTfR were significantly higher in children with storage iron deficiency but had a poor sensivity for recognizing iron deficiency without anemia. When ferritin values cannot accurately demonstrate the iron deficiency in children, the sTfR/ferritin ratio or sTfR-log ferritin is recommended to discriminate iron deficiency in the absence of anemia.

"Iron deficiency can occur after any bariatric procedure, despite routine supplementation", and "Routine postsurgery screening is recommended within 3 months after surgery; and then every 3 to 6 months until 12 months, and annually thereafter for all patients". "Iron status should be monitored in postbariatric patients at regular intervals using an iron panel, complete blood count, total iron-binding capacity, ferritin, and soluble transferrin receptor (if available), along with clinical signs and symptoms", and "Additional screening should be performed based on clinical signs and symptoms and/or laboratory findings or in cases where deficiency is suspected".

### Iron dextran [^113M5a7A]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION

Oral iron should be discontinued prior to administration of INFeD.

Dosage:

I. Iron Deficiency Anemia: Periodic hematologic determination (hemoglobin and hematocrit) is a simple and accurate technique for monitoring hematological response, and should be used as a guide in therapy. It should be recognized that iron storage may lag behind the appearance of normal blood morphology. Serum iron, total iron binding capacity (TIBC) and percent saturation of transferrin are other important tests for detecting and monitoring the iron deficient state.

After administration of iron dextran complex, evidence of a therapeutic response can be seen in a few days as an increase in the reticulocyte count.

Although serum ferritin is usually a good guide to body iron stores, the correlation of body iron stores and serum ferritin may not be valid in patients on chronic renal dialysis who are also receiving iron dextran complex.

Although there are significant variations in body build and weight distribution among males and females, the accompanying table and formula represent a convenient means for estimating the total iron required. This total iron requirement reflects the amount of iron needed to restore hemoglobin concentration to normal or near normal levels plus an additional allowance to provide adequate replenishment of iron stores in most individuals with moderately or severely reduced levels of hemoglobin. It should be remembered that iron deficiency anemia will not appear until essentially all iron stores have been depleted. Therapy, thus, should aim at not only replenishment of hemoglobin iron but iron stores as well.

AGA Clinical Practice Guidelines — anemia definition and ferritin threshold context note that in adults with anemia, defined as hemoglobin < 13 g/dL in men and < 12 g/dL in nonpregnant women, determining iron deficiency is an important step, and diagnosing iron deficiency has proposed ferritin cutoff values ranging from 15 to 100 ng/mL; studies that use bone marrow biopsy as the gold standard have defined the sensitivity and specificity of ferritin levels at different cutoff values.

### Iron deficiency anemia in chronic liver disease: etiopathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment [^115Lkd1H]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Chronic liver disease is accompanied by multiple hematological abnormalities. Iron deficiency anemia is a frequent complication of advanced liver disease. The etiology is multifactorial, mostly due to chronic hemorrhage into the gastrointestinal tract. The diagnosis of iron deficiency anemia is very challenging, as simple laboratory methods, including serum iron, ferritin, transferrin saturation (Tsat), and mean corpuscular volume are affected by the liver disease itself or the cause of the disease, resulting in difficulty in the interpretation of the results. Several new parameters, such as red blood cell ferritin, serum transferrin receptor test and index, and hepcidin, have been studied for their utility in indicating true iron deficiency in combination with chronic liver disease. Once iron deficiency anemia is diagnosed, it should be treated with oral or parenteral iron as well as portal pressure reducing drugs. Blood transfusion is reserved for symptomatic anemia despite iron supplementation.

### American association of clinical endocrinology clinical practice guideline: developing a diabetes mellitus comprehensive care plan-2022 update [^114P2My1]. Endocrine Practice (2022). High credibility.

Chronic kidney disease in diabetes mellitus — laboratory assessment and mineral-bone management are specified as follows: persons with CKD in DM should undergo annual or more frequent assessment of electrolytes, blood counts, and calcium, phosphorus, 25(OH) vitamin D, and parathyroid hormone (PTH) measurements to assess mineral metabolism. For those with serum bicarbonate level < 22 mEq/L, the addition of oral sodium bicarbonate is recommended to correct the serum bicarbonate level. Anemia, defined as hemoglobin < 13 g/dL in men and < 12 g/dL in women, should be further investigated with iron, transferrin saturation, ferritin, vitamin B12, and folate levels, and deficiencies should be replaced with a transferrin saturation target of ≥ 30% achieved. AACE recommends adequate calcium intake and achievement of 25(OH) vitamin D levels of > 30 ng/dL; supplementing vitamin D2 or D3 may reduce PTH in persons with CKD and secondary hyperparathyroidism, and active vitamin D preparations are usually necessary to keep the PTH level from increasing as eGFR declines. Hyperphosphatemia should be corrected into the normal range with dietary modification and use of phosphate binders.

### Anemia in children with inflammatory bowel disease: a position paper by the IBD committee of the north American society of pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology and nutrition [^1154eFBy]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2020). High credibility.

Transferrin, transferrin saturation (TSAT), and total iron-binding capacity (TIBC) — key diagnostic parameters: transferrin normal values can vary between 200 and 400 mg/dL, and TSAT reflects iron availability with normal transferrin saturation ranging from 16% to 45%; a saturation below 16% indicates suboptimal iron for erythropoiesis and levels above 50% suggest iron overload. TSAT performance for iron deficiency shows sensitivity of 50% to 88% and specificity of 63% to 78%. TIBC is the amount of iron needed to saturate plasma transferrin and, while high in functional or true iron deficiency, has reported diagnostic sensitivity of 34% and specificity of 97%.

### Current diagnostic and treatment strategies for specific dilated cardiomyopathies: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^111ywai8]. Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Key diagnostic strategies for iron-overload cardiomyopathy — when evaluating a new cardiomyopathy, screening for iron overload should include serum ferritin and transferrin saturation (Level of Evidence B). In the setting of transferrin saturation > 45% or ferritin > 250 µg/L (males) or > 200 µg/L (females), cardiac MRI should be performed (Level of Evidence B).

### Non-transferrin-bound iron is associated with plasma level of soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 but not with in vivo low-density lipoprotein oxidation [^112iLUdL]. Atherosclerosis (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Excess body iron is associated with increased cardiovascular disease risk, possibly via non-transferrin-bound iron (NTBI)-mediated enhancement of inflammation and oxidation of low-density lipoprotein (LDL).

Methods

We assessed this proposed atherosclerotic mechanism of body iron by determining the relationship of levels of serum iron parameters, including NTBI, with plasma markers of inflammation and LDL oxidation in 232 subjects who visited the outpatient clinic for hemochromatosis family screening.

Results

Plasma level of soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1) was positively related to ferritin (standardized beta coefficient 0.16) and to NTBI (0.185) and negatively to total iron-binding capacity (TIBC, -0.166). Significant higher levels of sICAM-1 were found for subjects in the highest quartile of NTBI compared to the lowest quartile of NTBI (122 microg/L (107–141) and 106 microg/L (89–125), median (interquartile range), p < 0.001). Odds ratio of subjects having sICAM-1 level above 134 microg/L (75th percentile) in the highest and lowest quartile of NTBI amounted 2.3. White blood cell count was positively related to ferritin (0.149). High-sensitivity C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, interleukin-8, oxidized LDL, oxidized LDL/apolipoprotein B and IgG and IgM antibodies to oxidized LDL were not related to any of the markers of iron status.

Conclusion

Excess body iron, reflected by elevated serum ferritin and NTBI and decreased TIBC, is associated with increased plasma level of sICAM-1 but not with markers of in vivo LDL oxidation.

Iron deficiency is a highly prevalent condition, which contributes to unnecessary morbidity, mortality, and health inequity. A serum ferritin concentration of less than 30 μg/L has a high specificity and sensitivity for diagnosing iron deficiency in adults, but the laboratory reported lower limit of normal (LLN) is typically lower. These LLNs might not be rooted in rigorous scientific evidence and might be contributing to structural underdiagnosis of iron deficiency. A systematic review was done per systematic reviews and meta-analysis guidelines with the use of medical literature databases from inception of each database to Nov 30, 2021, to identify studies that determined ferritin reference intervals in healthy adults and grey literature search for the five most common ferritin assays (registration number CRD42022268844). The objectives were to systematically summarise the ferritin reference intervals and to do a methodological quality assessment of the included studies. 2306 studies were screened and 61 full texts were included. 37 studies were eligible for analysis of the ferritin LLN in the general population. The population the sample was comprised of was a total of 21 882 females and 23 650 males participants. The ferritin LLN was a median of 8 μg/L (IQR 5–15) and mean of 9 μg/L (SD 11) in females and a median of 25 μg/L (IQR 16–44) and mean of 25 μg/L (SD 29) in males. 30 (49%) of 61 studies did not explicitly screen for patients at risk of iron deficiency, and 32 (52%) did not refer to a reference interval establishment guideline (eg, guideline recommended by Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute). The five most used commercial ferritin laboratory assays reported reference intervals with a median LLN of 11 (IQR 9–12) and mean of 9 μg/L (SD 4) for females and median of 22 (IQR 22–24) and mean of 23 μg/L (SD 4) for males. In the literature, serum ferritin reference intervals in healthy adults consistently report a LLN of less than 30 μg/L. Data driving these ferritin reference intervals are at high risk of bias, given no exclusion of individuals at risk for iron deficiency in the presumed normal population sample and no adherence to reference interval establishment standards. We suggest the use of evidence-based laboratory clinical decision limits to diagnose iron deficiency.

### Iron parameters determine the prognosis of critically ill patients [^113Kvmyd]. Critical Care Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

Because iron is both an essential and toxic micronutrient influencing the development of microbial infections, we evaluated the usefulness of iron parameters as outcome predictors in ICU patients.

Design

Prospective clinical single-center non-interventional study.

Setting

General internal medicine ICU; German University hospital.

Patients

One hundred and twelve septic and 43 nonseptic ICU patients, 156 healthy blood donors.

Measurements and Main Results

Serum iron parameters at admission were correlated with short and long term mortality in ICU subjects. Both hepcidin and ferritin concentrations were significantly elevated in ICU patients compared with blood donors and were the highest in septic patients. On the contrary, serum iron and transferrin levels were decreased in ICU subjects with lowest values among septic patients. Hepcidin values correlated with ferritin levels, and serum iron correlated strongly with transferrin saturation. A moderate correlation of hepcidin, ferritin, and transferrin with inflammatory parameters was noted. Both short- and long-term survivors displayed higher ferritin/transferrin levels and lower transferrin saturation. In Kaplan-Meier analyses, low iron levels (cutoff 10.5 μmol/mL), low transferrin saturation (cutoff 55%), and high serum transferrin concentrations (cutoff 1.6g/L) were associated with short- and long-term survival. In the subgroup of septic ICU subjects, low iron levels and transferrin saturation went along with a nonlethal outcome.

Conclusions

Our findings demonstrate that parameters of iron metabolism, particularly transferrin saturation, that reflect serum iron availability, are strong outcome predictors in ICU patients. These data suggest that a failure of iron homeostasis with increased iron availability in serum occurs in lethally ill ICU patients and should trigger prospective clinical trials evaluating the usefulness of iron-chelating therapy in critical illness and sepsis.

### 2018 AHA / ACC guideline for the management of adults with congenital heart disease: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines [^112m39Km]. Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Adults with congenital heart disease — cyanosis, iron deficiency, and erythrocytosis management: The guideline clarifies usage that "cyanosis" is used to denote hypoxemia from right-to-left shunting and emphasizes hematologic assessment in cyanotic patients: "Iron deficiency is frequently encountered in cyanotic individuals", and "Iron deficiency requires assessment of serum iron, ferritin, and transferrin levels, because mean corpuscular volume is not a reliable screening test". Limited evidence supports iron repletion when "treatment of transferrin saturation < 20% with iron supplementation until iron stores are replete can be done safely". Regarding hyperviscosity management, "Phlebotomy is, therefore, rarely necessary in patients with secondary erythrocytosis, and routine phlebotomy is not supported by data".

### A randomized trial of iron deficiency testing strategies in hemodialysis patients [^1111kXdp]. Kidney International (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Diagnosis of iron deficiency in hemodialysis patients is limited by the inaccuracy of commonly used tests. Reticulocyte hemoglobin content (CHr) is a test that has shown promise for improved diagnosis in preliminary studies. The purpose of this study was to compare iron management guided by serum ferritin and transferrin saturation to management guided by CHr.

Methods

A total of 157 hemodialysis patients from three centers were randomized to iron management based on (group 1) serum ferritin and transferrin saturation, or (group 2) CHr. Patients were followed for six months. Treatment with intravenous iron dextran, 100 mg for 10 consecutive treatments was initiated if (group 1) serum ferritin < 100 ng/mL or transferrin saturation < 20%, or (group 2) CHr < 29 pg.

Results

There was no significant difference between groups in the final mean hematocrit or epoetin dose. The mean weekly dose of iron dextran was 47.7 ± 35.5 mg in group 1 compared to 22.9 ± 20.5 mg in group 2 (P = 0.02). The final mean serum ferritin was 399.5 ± 247.6 ng/mL in group 1 compared to 304.7 ± 290.6 ng/mL in group 2 (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in final TSAT or CHr. Coefficient of variation was significantly lower for CHr than serum ferritin and transferrin saturation (3.4% vs. 43.6% and 39.5%, respectively).

Conclusions

CHr is a markedly more stable analyte than serum ferritin or transferrin saturation, and iron management based on CHr results in similar hematocrit and epoetin dosing while significantly reducing IV iron exposure.

Myelodysplastic syndromes — laboratory screening tests list other useful recommended laboratory screening tests that include serum erythropoietin, vitamin B12, serum or RBC folate levels, serum ferritin, iron, and total iron-binding capacity, noting that serum ferritin levels may be nonspecific, particularly in inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, and that in such cases obtaining serum iron levels and TIBC along with serum ferritin may be helpful.

### Current diagnostic and treatment strategies for specific dilated cardiomyopathies: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^113CLG4W]. Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Iron-overload cardiomyopathy — diagnosis and initial management begin with serological testing, where serum transferrin saturation (serum iron/total iron binding capacity of > 45%) and elevated serum ferritin > 200 µg/L in men or > 150 µg/L in women supports the diagnosis; if HH is suspected, especially with a known family history, testing for the HH genotype should be performed. Diagnosis of cardiac iron overload is possible with cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), in which a decreased T2 signal correlates with myocardial iron infiltration and depressed left ventricular function. The established treatment for HH is phlebotomy, and in secondary iron overload, there is a role for chelation therapy.

### Diurnal variation of serum iron, iron-binding capacity, transferrin saturation, and ferritin levels [^112SKvHf]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2002). Low credibility.

Serum iron levels vary throughout the day. Morning levels are generally assumed to be higher than afternoon or evening levels. We studied whether our practice of restricting serum iron collections to the morning was necessary. Serum iron, iron-binding capacity, transferrin saturation, and ferritin levels were determined on blood specimens obtained from 20 healthy adult volunteers at 8 AM, noon, and 4 PM (day 1) and 8 AM (day 2). Although statistically significant differences among mean values for the collection times were observed for iron, iron-binding capacity, and (log) ferritin, no consistent diurnal variation was seen. Morning iron levels were higher than afternoon levels for only half of the subjects. Between-day variation for all 4 analytes was similar to within-day variation. We conclude that the practice of restricting iron specimen collections to a specific time of day does not improve the reliability of the test result.

### Sex, lies, and iron deficiency: a call to change ferritin reference ranges [^115PFf6Y]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2023). Medium credibility.

Iron deficiency is a very common and treatable disorder. Of all the tests available to diagnose iron deficiency, the serum ferritin is the most able to discriminate iron deficiency from other disorders. However, the reference range for ferritin in many laboratories will lead to underdiagnosis of iron deficiency in women. Studies have shown that 30%-50% of healthy women will have no marrow iron stores, so basing ferritin cutoffs on the lowest 2.5% of sampled ferritins is not appropriate. In addition, several lines of evidence suggest the body physiologic ferritin "cutoff" is 50ng/mL. Work is needed to establish more realistic ferritin ranges to avoid underdiagnosing a readily treatable disorder.

### Diagnosis and management of hemochromatosis: 2011 practice guideline by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^115E1W6a]. Hepatology (2011). Medium credibility.

Hemochromatosis therapeutic phlebotomy and monitoring — patients with hemochromatosis and iron overload should undergo therapeutic phlebotomy weekly (as tolerated), with target ferritin 50–100 μg/L. In the absence of indicators suggesting significant liver disease (ALT, AST elevation), C282Y homozygotes who have an elevated ferritin (but < 1000 μg/L) should proceed to phlebotomy without a liver biopsy. Patients with end-organ damage due to iron overload should undergo regular phlebotomy to the same endpoints. During treatment for HH, dietary adjustments are unnecessary, and vitamin C supplements and iron supplements should be avoided. Patients with hemochromatosis and iron overload should be monitored for reaccumulation of iron and undergo maintenance phlebotomy, again aiming for a ferritin level of 50–100 μg/L. We recommend treatment by phlebotomy of patients with non-HFE iron overload who have an elevated HIC.

Baseline and periodic monitoring of iron, total iron-binding capacity, transferrin saturation, or ferritin levels is recommended. Compared with an ESA alone, adding iron increased the likelihood of hematopoietic response (RR, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.09 to 1.26) and reduced the likelihood of RBC transfusion (RR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.60 to 0.92).

6 ADVERSE REACTIONS

The following clinically significant adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling:

Hypersensitivity Reactions (see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)).
Iron Overload (see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)).

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, the adverse reaction rates observed cannot be directly compared to rates in other clinical trials and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.

The safety of Monoferric was evaluated in 3008 patients with iron deficiency anemia enrolled in two randomized, actively-controlled trials. Trial 1 enrolled adult patients with iron deficiency anemia with intolerance to oral iron or had an unsatisfactory response to oral iron with a clinical need for repletion of iron stores. Eligible subjects were required to have a baseline hemoglobin of ≤ 11g/dl, transferrin saturation (TSAT) of less than 20% and serum ferritin level of < 100 ng/mL. Trial 2 enrolled adult patients with non-dialysis dependent chronic kidney disease (CKD) with iron deficiency anemia (see Clinical Studies (14)). Eligible subjects also had to have serum ferritin ≤ 100 ng/mL or ≤ 300 ng/mL if TSAT ≤ 30%.

### Anemia in children with inflammatory bowel disease: a position paper by the IBD committee of the north American society of pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology and nutrition [^113eMMXn]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2020). High credibility.

Serum ferritin — assessment in children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) includes threshold-based interpretation and important caveats: the WHO and American Academy of Pediatrics definitions note iron deficiency at ferritin levels below 12 and 15 μg/L in otherwise healthy children, while in adult IBD guidance serum ferritin levels below 30 μg/L are highly suggestive of iron deficiency and levels above 100 μg/L are unlikely; values between 30 and 100 μg/L may still indicate iron deficiency with inflammation, and post–intravenous iron ferritin may be misleading for up to 8 weeks. Interpretation requires consideration of inflammatory markers because ferritin is an acute phase reactant and can be altered by non–iron-related conditions.

### Evaluation of microcytosis [^111wbP4h]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Microcytosis is typically an incidental finding in asymptomatic patients who received a complete blood count for other reasons. The condition is defined as a mean corpuscular volume of less than 80 µm3 (80 fL) in adults. The most common causes of microcytosis are iron deficiency anemia and thalassemia trait. Other diagnoses to consider include anemia of chronic disease, lead toxicity, and sideroblastic anemia. Serum ferritin measurement is the first laboratory test recommended in the evaluation of microcytosis. Low ferritin levels suggest iron deficiency. Once a presumptive diagnosis of iron deficiency anemia has been made, an underlying source for the deficiency should be determined. Iron deficiency anemia in adults is presumed to be caused by blood loss; the most common source of bleeding is the gastrointestinal tract. The possibility of gastrointestinal malignancy must be considered. If the serum ferritin level is not initially low, further evaluation should include total iron-binding capacity, transferrin saturation level, serum iron level, and possibly hemoglobin electrophoresis. Anemia of chronic disease is suggested with low iron levels and decreased total iron-binding capacity. Patients with beta-thalassemia trait usually have elevated levels of hemoglobin A2.

### Biological variability of transferrin saturation and unsaturated iron-binding capacity [^114oBBvu]. The American Journal of Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Transferrin saturation is widely considered the preferred screening test for hemochromatosis. Unsaturated iron-binding capacity has similar performance at lower cost. However, the within-person biological variability of both these tests may limit their ability at commonly used cut points to detect HFE C282Y homozygous patients.

Methods

The Hemochromatosis and Iron Overload Screening Study screened 101,168 primary care participants for iron overload using transferrin saturation, unsaturated iron-binding capacity, ferritin, and HFE C282Y and H63D genotyping. Transferrin saturation and unsaturated iron-binding capacity were performed at initial screening and again when selected participants and controls returned for a clinical examination several months later. A missed case was defined as a C282Y homozygote who had transferrin saturation below the cut point (45% for women, 50% for men) or unsaturated iron-binding capacity above the cut point (150 micromol/L for women, 125 micromol/L for men) at the initial screening or the clinical examination, or both, regardless of serum ferritin.

Results

There were 209 C282Y previously undiagnosed homozygotes with transferrin saturation and unsaturated iron-binding capacity testing performed at the initial screening and clinical examination. Sixty-eight C282Y homozygotes (33%) would have been missed at these transferrin saturation cut points (19 men, 49 women; median serum ferritin level of 170 microg/L; first and third quartiles, 50 and 474 microg/L), and 58 homozygotes (28%) would have been missed at the unsaturated iron-binding capacity cut points (20 men, 38 women; median serum ferritin level of 168 microg/L; first and third quartiles, 38 and 454 microg/L). There was no advantage to using fasting samples.

Conclusions

The within-person biological variability of transferrin saturation and unsaturated iron-binding capacity limits their usefulness as an initial screening test for expressing C282Y homozygotes.

### Effect of twice weekly versus daily iron treatment in Turkish children with iron deficiency anemia [^114w5XQM]. Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (2003). Low credibility.

This study was designed to propose a more practical, effective, safer, inexpensive, and manageable alternative treatment of iron deficiency anemia (IDA) for the developing countries. The study involves 94 children between the ages of 5 months and 6 years who had been seen in the authors' hospital and diagnosed as having iron deficiency anemia. Ninety-four children with IDA were randomly divided into two groups: 48 children comprised the first group, which was administered conventional treatment, and 46 children comprised the second group, which was administered intermittent treatment involving iron administration 2 days a week. Twenty-three children whose age and gender distribution were compatible with the other groups were included in the study as the control group. Both groups were reevaluated for their initial hematologic parameters at the end of the treatment. When the parameters of both groups were compared with the parameters of the control group after the treatment, there were no differences between hemoglobin, hematocrit, red blood cell, mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, serum iron, and ferritin levels of conventional and intermittent treatment groups. With respect to certain parameters, such as red cell distribution, serum iron binding capacity, transferrin saturation, transferrin receptor, and transferrin receptor/log ferritin, however, intermittent treatment was superior to the conventional treatment method (p < .05). In IDA, when a conventional treatment method or an intermittent treatment method is used, there are no differences between the hematological parameters. In fact, the intermittent treatment method has been found to be superior in many parameters.

### ACG clinical guideline: hereditary hemochromatosis [^116gS2jE]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2019). High credibility.

Hereditary hemochromatosis — when to initiate treatment is outlined for HFE genotypes: Treatment should be initiated in C282Y homozygotes with elevated serum ferritin (SF), defined as > 300 ng/mL in men and > 200 ng/mL in women, along with a transferrin saturation (TS) of ≥ 45%. Homozygous patients with a SF within normal limits at diagnosis are unlikely to develop clinically relevant iron overload later in life and therefore can be monitored with serial assessment of liver aminotransferase and SF levels. Although patients with a SF of < 1,000 ng/mL at diagnosis are unlikely to have end-organ damage, we still suggest treatment because between 13% and 35% of men and between 16% and 22% of women will progress to a SF of > 1,000 ng/mL if left untreated. For compound heterozygotes (C282Y/H63D) the risk of developing clinically relevant iron overload is low; a liver biopsy can be considered to rule out secondary liver disorders or to evaluate NAFLD and cirrhosis, particularly among individuals with a SF above 1,000 ng/mL, and for compound heterozygotes or H63D homozygotes with evidence of elevated hepatic iron concentration (HIC) on biopsy, iron removal can be considered.

2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

2.1 Important Pre-Treatment Information

Discontinue administration of any iron-containing products prior to administration of INFeD.

Assess baseline hematologic (hemoglobin and hematocrit) and iron storage parameters (serum iron, total iron binding capacity, and percent saturation of transferrin) to monitor response to therapy.

Administer a test dose of INFeD prior to administration of therapeutic dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

2.2 Recommended Dosage for Iron Deficiency Anemia

Calculate the INFeD dose based upon Table 1 and formulas below. Continue INFeD until hemoglobin is within the normal range and iron stores are replete.

Administer daily doses of no more than 2 mL of INFeD until the total required dose is administered. Monitor response to therapy by evaluating hematologic parameters (hemoglobin and hematocrit) and iron storage parameters (serum iron, total iron binding capacity, and percent saturation of transferrin). Iron storage parameters may improve prior to hematologic parameters. Serum ferritin may not be an accurate measure of body iron stores in patients on chronic dialysis.

### Reflective testing: how useful is the practice of adding on tests by laboratory clinicians? [^1176UUnP]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2004). Low credibility.

Aims

To investigate the clinical value and practice of reflective testing, a new term to describe the practice of adding on tests when reporting or clinically authorising results.

Methods

A consultant medical biochemist collected over a calendar year (2001) copies of clinical biochemistry reports on samples to which he had added on either iron studies (iron, total iron binding capacity (TIBC), and percentage saturation), or vitamin D. Iron studies and vitamin D were added on when biochemical results, available clinical information, demographic data, and clinical experience-or combinations thereof-suggested the possibility of haemochromatosis or vitamin D deficiency, respectively. The number of reports that the consultant authorised was estimated for the same calendar year. The number and percentage of raised TIBC percentage saturation and low vitamin D results from the tests that were added on were collated.

Results

Raised TIBC saturation values were found in 28 patients (18.7% of the iron studies added on), of whom 16 were subsequently genotyped, eight having a genotype consistent with haemochromatosis. Thirty one patients with vitamin D deficiency (23.1% of the vitamin D tests added on) were identified.

Conclusions

The addition of iron studies and vitamin D tests by a laboratory clinician, when reporting, resulted in the identification of patients with haemochromatosis and vitamin D deficiency. The practice of adding on tests should be called reflective testing, because it is discretionary and is based on the clinical judgement of a laboratory clinician in the interpretation of results.

### Iron deficiency anaemia [^115LH3LE]. Lancet (2016). Excellent credibility.

Anaemia affects roughly a third of the world's population; half the cases are due to iron deficiency. It is a major and global public health problem that affects maternal and child mortality, physical performance, and referral to health-care professionals. Children aged 0–5 years, women of childbearing age, and pregnant women are particularly at risk. Several chronic diseases are frequently associated with iron deficiency anaemia — notably chronic kidney disease, chronic heart failure, cancer, and inflammatory bowel disease. Measurement of serum ferritin, transferrin saturation, serum soluble transferrin receptors, and the serum soluble transferrin receptors-ferritin index are more accurate than classic red cell indices in the diagnosis of iron deficiency anaemia. In addition to the search for and treatment of the cause of iron deficiency, treatment strategies encompass prevention, including food fortification and iron supplementation. Oral iron is usually recommended as first-line therapy, but the most recent intravenous iron formulations, which have been available for nearly a decade, seem to replenish iron stores safely and effectively. Hepcidin has a key role in iron homoeostasis and could be a future diagnostic and therapeutic target. In this Seminar, we discuss the clinical presentation, epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and acute management of iron deficiency anaemia, and outstanding research questions for treatment.

Secondary iron overload in nontransfusion-dependent iron-loading anemias — because serum ferritin (SF) may underestimate hepatic iron concentration (HIC), an SF threshold of > 800 ng/mL should lead to initiation of treatment in these patients; both phlebotomy and chelation may have a therapeutic role, though chelation is the preferred treatment due to concerns regarding exacerbation of the underlying anemia.

### Diagnosis and management of hemochromatosis: 2011 practice guideline by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^115umD7P]. Hepatology (2011). Medium credibility.

Hereditary hemochromatosis phlebotomy regimen — initial depletion and maintenance guidance are as follows: One phlebotomy (removal of 500 mL blood) is performed "weekly or biweekly", and each unit removed contains "approximately 200–250 mg iron". Monitoring includes checking serum ferritin "after every 10–12 phlebotomies (approximately 3 months)" early in treatment, with excess iron mobilization indicated when ferritin "drops to between 50 and 100 μg/L". As the "target range of 50–100 μg/L" is approached, testing may be increased; frequent phlebotomy is stopped when ferritin "reaches 50–100 μg/L", and then continued to keep ferritin "between 50 and 100 μg/L". Safety measures include allowing hematocrit/hemoglobin to fall by "no more than 20% of prior level". Treatment burden can be substantial in heavily iron-loaded patients — those with total body iron stores " > 30 g" may require "up to 2–3 years" of therapy — and maintenance needs vary, with some patients requiring phlebotomy "monthly", while others may need "only 1–2 units of blood removed per year".

### Two different modalities of iron gluconate I.V. administration: effects on iron, oxidative and inflammatory status in peritoneal dialysis patients [^112FdPgn]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Iron deficiency represents an important problem for dialysis patients. Oral iron administration is frequently ineffective, requiring parenteral administration, which may trigger severe side effects due to inflammation and/or peroxidation. The aim of the present study was to clarify the effects of parenteral iron administration on iron, inflammatory and oxidative status in peritoneal dialysis patients and compare two different modalities of injecting ferric gluconate intravenously.

Methods

Twenty peritoneal dialysis patients (10M/10F, mean age 60 ± 16 years) were given i.v. iron gluconate (62.5 mg) both concentrated (1–2 min, PULSE) and diluted in 100 mL of glucose solution (30 min, SLOW). The interval between the first and second administration was 15–60 days. Blood cell count, serum iron, total iron binding capacity (TIBC), ferritin, C-reactive protein (CRP), reactive oxygen species (ROS) concentrations and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) were measured before iron infusion (T0), after 30 min (T1) and after 24 h (T2).

Results

No patient had clinical symptoms during or within an hour of iron administration. Serum transferrin was oversaturated in 25% of cases, no matter how iron was injected. Oxidative and inflammatory status parameters were not affected by iron administration: no difference in CRP, ROS concentrations or TAC was found at any time between PULSE and SLOW group.

Conclusions

Our findings showed that neither inflammation nor peroxidation in peritoneal dialysis patients was clinically triggered by 62.5 mg i.v. iron infusion. Both modalities were equally safe. Therefore, in the absence of clinical side effects, PULSE intravenous administration, being cheaper and not so problematic for outpatients, is preferable to SLOW.

### Second international round robin for the quantification of serum non-transferrin-bound iron and labile plasma iron in patients with iron-overload disorders [^11161qnM]. Haematologica (2016). Low credibility.

Non-transferrin-bound iron and its labile (redox active) plasma iron component are thought to be potentially toxic forms of iron originally identified in the serum of patients with iron overload. We compared ten worldwide leading assays (6 for non-transferrin-bound iron and 4 for labile plasma iron) as part of an international inter-laboratory study. Serum samples from 60 patients with four different iron-overload disorders in various treatment phases were coded and sent in duplicate for analysis to five different laboratories worldwide. Some laboratories provided multiple assays. Overall, highest assay levels were observed for patients with untreated hereditary hemochromatosis and β-thalassemia intermedia, patients with transfusion-dependent myelodysplastic syndromes and patients with transfusion-dependent and chelated β-thalassemia major. Absolute levels differed considerably between assays and were lower for labile plasma iron than for non-transferrin-bound iron. Four assays also reported negative values. Assays were reproducible with high between-sample and low within-sample variation. Assays correlated and correlations were highest within the group of non-transferrin-bound iron assays and within that of labile plasma iron assays. Increased transferrin saturation, but not ferritin, was a good indicator of the presence of forms of circulating non-transferrin-bound iron. The possibility of using non-transferrin-bound iron and labile plasma iron measures as clinical indicators of overt iron overload and/or of treatment efficacy would largely depend on the rigorous validation and standardization of assays.

### ACG clinical guideline: hereditary hemochromatosis [^1119Ki27]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2019). High credibility.

Hereditary hemochromatosis — definitions for key terms: Hepcidin is defined as a hormone synthesized and secreted by the liver in response to circulating iron levels, which inhibits iron absorption from the intestinal mucosal cells by degradation of ferroportin-1. Ferroportin-1 is a transmembrane protein found predominantly in the intestinal epithelial cells, hepatocytes, and macrophages, which facilitates iron export from the cells. Transferrin is a glycoprotein synthesized by the liver which exists in 3 forms (apo, monomeric, and dimeric); it carries iron in the circulation. Unsaturated iron-binding capacity is the portion of iron-binding sites on transferrin that are not occupied by iron, and a low unsaturated iron-binding capacity raises the suspicion for hemochromatosis. Total iron-binding capacity is the sum of the serum iron and unsaturated iron-binding capacity. Transferrin saturation is the percentage of iron bound to transferrin and is calculated by dividing serum iron by total iron-binding capacity. Ferritin is an intracellular protein that stores and releases intracellular iron.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^1175qH98]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Hereditary hemochromatosis (HFE) — Screening should be considered in all patients with abnormal AST/ALT levels and include an iron panel to determine transferrin saturation and serum ferritin; if the transferrin saturation is 45% or higher, or the serum ferritin is elevated, consideration should be given for HFE gene mutation analysis. Because ferritin is an acute phase reactant, an elevated ferritin in acute hepatitis likely does not indicate iron overload. The presence of a homozygous C282Y mutation confirms HFE-related hereditary hemochromatosis, whereas compound C282Y/H63D heterozygotes rarely manifest chronic liver disease from iron overload. In patients with homozygous C282Y or compound heterozygous C282Y/H63D mutations who have elevated AST/ALT levels or ferritin > 1,000 μg/l, or in non-HFE hemochromatosis, liver biopsy should be considered to stage liver fibrosis and quantify hepatic iron overload to guide therapy.

### AGA clinical practice guidelines on the gastrointestinal evaluation of iron deficiency anemia [^116PBzzy]. Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Iron deficiency anemia — ferritin thresholds and adjunctive testing: Based on a systematic review of 55 studies, a ferritin threshold value of < 45 ng/mL has a sensitivity for iron deficiency of 85% (95% confidence interval [CI] 82%–87%) with a specificity of 92% (95% CI, 91%–94%), whereas a ferritin value of < 15 ng/mL has a sensitivity of 59% (95% CI, 55%–62%) and specificity of 99% (95% CI, 98%–99%). A ferritin threshold value of < 45 ng/mL was believed to maximize sensitivity for the diagnosis of IDA with an acceptable number of false-positive diagnoses, and the tradeoff between higher sensitivity and lower specificity using a threshold of 45 ng/mL instead of 15 ng/mL was believed to provide an acceptable balance of benefits of fewer missed diagnoses compared with potential harms of additional diagnostic evaluations. In some patients, such as those with chronic inflammatory conditions or chronic kidney disease, ferritin levels may not accurately reflect body iron stores and other clinical tests, such as the serum iron, transferrin saturation, soluble transferrin receptor, or C-reactive protein, may be useful adjunctive tests to assist in the diagnosis of iron deficiency.

### Daprodustat (Jesduvroq) [^115LMGR6]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Daprodustat is a reversible inhibitor of HIF-PH1, PH2 and PH3 (IC50in the low nM range). This activity results in the stabilization and nuclear accumulation of HIF-1α and HIF-2α transcription factors, leading to increased transcription of the HIF-responsive genes, including erythropoietin.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Effects on Erythropoiesis

Daprodustat increases endogenous erythropoietin in a dose-dependent manner within 6 to 8 hours after administration. With repeat doses, peak increases in reticulocyte counts occur between 7 and 15 days, with subsequent increases in red blood cell production. New hemoglobin steady-state levels are reached several weeks (approximately 4 weeks in ESA-users and approximately 16–20 weeks in ESA-non-users) after initial administration.

Effects on Iron Metabolism and Utilization

Daprodustat increased serum transferrin and total iron binding capacity (TIBC) and decreased serum ferritin, transferrin saturation, and hepcidin when administered for 52 weeks in adults on dialysis with anemia due to CKD.

Cardiac Electrophysiology

At a dose 10 times the maximum recommended dose, daprodustat does not prolong the QTc interval to any clinically relevant extent.

### Anemia in children with inflammatory bowel disease: a position paper by the IBD committee of the north American society of pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology and nutrition [^113kPdh5]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2020). High credibility.

Pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) — post–iron repletion monitoring and recurrence risk specify that a post-treatment ferritin level of 400 μg/L is predictive of low likelihood of recurrence of anemia within the subsequent 1–5 years of follow-up, and it is important to monitor the complete blood count (CBC), ferritin, transferrin saturation (TSAT), and C-reactive protein (CRP) every 3 months for up to 1 year, and then every 6 months if the disease is inactive; iron treatment can be promptly started if the Hgb or ferritin levels drop below the normal range.

### Is hepcidin a link between anemia, inflammation and liver function in hemodialyzed patients? [^1129m94G]. American Journal of Nephrology (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Hepcidin synthesis in hepatocytes is modulated in response to anemia, hypoxia or inflammation. A cross-sectional study was performed to assess hepcidin correlations with markers of iron status, erythropoietin therapy and markers of inflammation in hemodialyzed patients and in the healthy volunteers.

Methods

Iron status, complete blood count, creatinine, albumin, lipids were assessed using standard laboratory methods. Hepcidin and high-sensitivity CRP were measured using commercially available kits.

Results

Serum iron, TIBC, TSAT, erythrocyte count, Hb, Ht, platelet count, albumin, and cholesterol were lower, whereas ferritin and hepcidin were higher in hemodialyzed patients over controls. Hepcidin correlated positively with triglycerides, albumin, aspartate aminotransferase, lymphocyte count, ferritin and erythropoietin dose and negatively with erythrocyte count, Hb, and Ht in hemodialyzed patients. In multiple regression analysis, triglycerides (beta value was 0.28, p = 0.02) and albumin (beta value was -0.31, p = 0.006) were correlates of hepcidin in hemodialyzed patients.

Conclusions

Elevated hepcidin levels in hemodialyzed patients may be due to functional iron deficiency and anemia. Liver plays an important role in the synthesis of hepcidin. Low-grade inflammation, frequently found in hemodialyzed patients, might also contribute to elevated hepcidin concentration. Hypothesis that hepcidin might link anemia, inflammation and liver function in kidney disease should be further evaluated.

### Serum or plasma ferritin concentration as an index of iron deficiency and overload [^1157g8j4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Reference standard indices of iron deficiency and iron overload are generally invasive, expensive, and can be unpleasant or occasionally risky. Ferritin is an iron storage protein and its concentration in the plasma or serum reflects iron stores; low ferritin indicates iron deficiency, while elevated ferritin reflects risk of iron overload. However, ferritin is also an acute-phase protein and its levels are elevated in inflammation and infection. The use of ferritin as a diagnostic test of iron deficiency and overload is a common clinical practice.

Objectives

To determine the diagnostic accuracy of ferritin concentrations (serum or plasma) for detecting iron deficiency and risk of iron overload in primary and secondary iron-loading syndromes.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases (10 June 2020): DARE (Cochrane Library) Issue 2 of 4 2015, HTA (Cochrane Library) Issue 4 of 4 2016, CENTRAL (Cochrane Library) Issue 6 of 12 2020, MEDLINE (OVID) 1946 to 9 June 2020, Embase (OVID) 1947 to week 23 2020, CINAHL (Ebsco) 1982 to June 2020, Web of Science (ISI) SCI, SSCI, CPCI-exp & CPCI-SSH to June 2020, POPLINE 16/8/18, Open Grey (10/6/20), TRoPHI (10/6/20), Bibliomap (10/6/20), IBECS (10/6/20), SCIELO (10/6/20), Global Index Medicus (10/6/20) AIM, IMSEAR, WPRIM, IMEMR, LILACS (10/6/20), PAHO (10/6/20), WHOLIS 10/6/20, IndMED (16/8/18) and Native Health Research Database (10/6/20). We also searched two trials registers and contacted relevant organisations for unpublished studies.

Selection Criteria

We included all study designs seeking to evaluate serum or plasma ferritin concentrations measured by any current or previously available quantitative assay as an index of iron status in individuals of any age, sex, clinical and physiological status from any country.

Data Collection and Analysis

We followed standard Cochrane methods. We designed the data extraction form to record results for ferritin concentration as the index test, and bone marrow iron content for iron deficiency and liver iron content for iron overload as the reference standards. Two other authors further extracted and validated the number of true positive, true negative, false positive, false negative cases, and extracted or derived the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values for each threshold presented for iron deficiency and iron overload in included studies. We assessed risk of bias and applicability using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS)-2 tool. We used GRADE assessment to enable the quality of evidence and hence strength of evidence for our conclusions.

Main Results

Our search was conducted initially in 2014 and updated in 2017, 2018 and 2020 (10 June). We identified 21,217 records and screened 14,244 records after duplicates were removed. We assessed 316 records in full text. We excluded 190 studies (193 records) with reasons and included 108 studies (111 records) in the qualitative and quantitative analysis. There were 11 studies (12 records) that we screened from the last search update and appeared eligible for a future analysis. We decided to enter these as awaiting classification. We stratified the analysis first by participant clinical status: apparently healthy and non-healthy populations. We then stratified by age and pregnancy status as: infants and children, adolescents, pregnant women, and adults. Iron deficiency We included 72 studies (75 records) involving 6059 participants. Apparently healthy populations Five studies screened for iron deficiency in people without apparent illness. In the general adult population, three studies reported sensitivities of 63% to 100% at the optimum cutoff for ferritin, with corresponding specificities of 92% to 98%, but the ferritin cutoffs varied between studies. One study in healthy children reported a sensitivity of 74% and a specificity of 77%. One study in pregnant women reported a sensitivity of 88% and a specificity of 100%. Overall confidence in these estimates was very low because of potential bias, indirectness, and sparse and heterogenous evidence. No studies screened for iron overload in apparently healthy people. People presenting for medical care There were 63 studies among adults presenting for medical care (5042 participants). For a sample of 1000 subjects with a 35% prevalence of iron deficiency (of the included studies in this category) and supposing a 85% specificity, there would be 315 iron-deficient subjects correctly classified as having iron deficiency and 35 iron-deficient subjects incorrectly classified as not having iron deficiency, leading to a 90% sensitivity. Thresholds proposed by the authors of the included studies ranged between 12 to 200 µg/L. The estimated diagnostic odds ratio was 50. Among non-healthy adults using a fixed threshold of 30 μg/L (nine studies, 512 participants, low-certainty evidence), the pooled estimate for sensitivity was 79% with a 95% confidence interval of (58%, 91%) and specificity of 98%, with a 95% confidence interval of (91%, 100%). The estimated diagnostic odds ratio was 140, a relatively highly informative test. Iron overload We included 36 studies (36 records) involving 1927 participants. All studies concerned non-healthy populations. There were no studies targeting either infants, children, or pregnant women. Among all populations (one threshold for males and females; 36 studies, 1927 participants, very low-certainty evidence): for a sample of 1000 subjects with a 42% prevalence of iron overload (of the included studies in this category) and supposing a 65% specificity, there would be 332 iron-overloaded subjects correctly classified as having iron overload and 85 iron-overloaded subjects incorrectly classified as not having iron overload, leading to a 80% sensitivity. The estimated diagnostic odds ratio was 8.

Authors' Conclusions

At a threshold of 30 micrograms/L, there is low-certainty evidence that blood ferritin concentration is reasonably sensitive and a very specific test for iron deficiency in people presenting for medical care. There is very low certainty that high concentrations of ferritin provide a sensitive test for iron overload in people where this condition is suspected. There is insufficient evidence to know whether ferritin concentration performs similarly when screening asymptomatic people for iron deficiency or overload.

### New horizons in iron deficiency anaemia in older adults [^117Legtq]. Age and Ageing (2020). Medium credibility.

Iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) is common in older adults and associated with a range of adverse outcomes. Differentiating iron deficiency from other causes of anaemia is important to ensure appropriate investigations and treatment. It is possible to make the diagnosis reliably using simple blood tests. Clinical evaluation and assessment are required to help determine the underlying cause and to initiate appropriate investigations. IDA in men and post-menopausal females is most commonly due to occult gastrointestinal blood loss until proven otherwise, although there is a spectrum of underlying causative pathologies. Investigation decisions should take account of the wishes of the patient and their competing comorbidities, individualising the approach. Management involves supplementation using oral or intravenous (IV) iron then consideration of treatment of the underlying cause of deficiency. Future research areas are outlined including the role of Hepcidin and serum soluble transferrin receptor measurement, quantitative faecal immunochemical testing, alternative dosing regimens and the potential role of IV iron preparations.

### A diagnostic approach to hyperferritinemia with a non-elevated transferrin saturation [^114SLmej]. Journal of Hepatology (2011). Low credibility.

Elevated serum ferritin concentrations are common in clinical practice. In this review, we provide an approach to interpreting the serum ferritin elevation in relationship to other clinical parameters including the patient history, transferrin saturation, serum concentrations of alanine, and aspartate aminotransferases (ALT, AST), testing for HFE mutations, liver imaging, liver biopsy, and liver iron concentration. We used observations from a large series of patients with hepatic iron overload documented by liver iron concentration measurement from two referral practices as a gold standard to guide the interpretation of the predictive values of non-invasive iron tests. Three case studies illustrate common problems in interpreting iron blood tests.

### Iron status of young males and females performing weight-training exercise [^111APaKc]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose

To determine the effect of weight training on measures of iron status in young males and females.

Methods

Forty (27 female, 13 male) non-weight-trained college age subjects participated in a 12-wk weight-training program conducted 3 d.wk-1. Blood samples and food diaries were obtained pretraining and at 4-wk intervals. Blood was analyzed for hemoglobin, hematocrit, serum iron (SI), total iron binding capacity (TIBC), transferrin saturation (TS), serum ferritin (SF), soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR), and creatine kinase (CK). Subjects were grouped by SF level (FL, females ≤ 20 microg.L-1; FN, females > 20 microg.L-1; ML, males ≤ 45 microg.L-1; MN, males ≥ 50 microg.L-1) to determine the impact of initial iron status on measured responses.

Results

Weight training increased strength and fat-free mass and decreased levels of percent body fat. Hemoglobin concentration declined after 12 wk of training (13.7 ± 1.6 vs 13.2 ± 1.7 g.dL-1), independent of gender or initial iron status. Only the MN group experienced a decline in SF level after 8 wk of training (129.7 ± 77.9 vs 102.0 ± 57.8 microg.L-1). No significant changes were observed for hematocrit, SI, TIBC, TS, sTfR, or CK measures. Total iron intake, but not heme or bioavailable iron intakes, declined at the 12th week of training compared with baseline (13.4 ± 6.5 vs 10.7 ± 4.8 mg.d-1) and was not significantly correlated with hematological or iron status measures.

Conclusions

Hemoglobin concentration declines without alterations in SI, TIBC, TS, or sTfR after 12 wk of weight training. The SF level of males with adequate iron status is lowered with weight training but not among females or males with low iron status.

Iron status evaluation in chronic kidney disease (CKD) anemia on erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) therapy recommends assessing transferrin saturation (TSAT) and ferritin at least every 3 months during ESA therapy, including when deciding to start or continue iron therapy, and testing TSAT and ferritin more frequently when initiating or increasing ESA dose, with blood loss, when monitoring response after a course of IV iron, and when iron stores may become depleted (Not Graded).

### Should serum transferrin saturation Be included as a therapeutic target in addition to serum ferritin in treating HFE-hemochromatosis? [^113Gvcb6]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). Medium credibility.

In HFE-hemochromatosis, transferrin saturation (TSAT) indirectly reflects plasma non-transferrin-bound iron (NTBI), which drives iron overload and tissue damage. TSAT above ~75% suggests harmful NTBI levels. Despite its clinical relevance, NTBI remains understudied due to the limitations of current assays. High TSAT levels persist during maintenance therapy, yet some guidelines omit TSAT monitoring, though it correlates with symptoms like fatigue and joint pain. Monitoring TSAT may improve outcomes. Randomized trials comparing ferritin-only versus ferritin-plus-TSAT-guided treatment are needed. Consideration should be given to approaches that minimize plasma NTBI in managing and monitoring patients with hemochromatosis. Until reliable NTBI testing has been established, TSAT should be included in the management of HFE-hemochromatosis.

### Interpretation of ferritin concentrations in the dermatology clinic [^116Gd8nd]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Ferritin measurement is a common laboratory test in dermatology. Ferritin is a marker of iron storage in the human body but can also be -elevated in inflammatory states. Therefore, changes in ferritin are nonspecific, and correlation of specific clinical findings and risk factors with ferritin concentration and other biomarkers, e.g. iron studies or C-reactive protein tests, is recommended. This article discusses iron metabolism and the indications for ferritin measurement in dermatology and how to interpret the laboratory results.

### Physiologically based serum ferritin thresholds for iron deficiency among women and children from Africa, Asia, Europe, and central America: a multinational comparative study [^111tZ19f]. The Lancet: Global Health (2025). High credibility.

Background

Diagnosis of iron deficiency commonly relies on measurement of serum ferritin concentrations. WHO guidelines identify serum ferritin thresholds for iron deficiency among healthy individuals of less than 15 μg/L for women and less than 12 μg/L for children under 5 years, based on expert opinion. We report thresholds for iron deficiency for apparently healthy non-pregnant women and young children based on physiological indicators.

Methods

We performed secondary analyses of cross-sectional data from women (aged 15–49 years) and children (aged 6–59 months) from 12 countries in Africa, Asia, Europe, and central America from available surveys (2007–19). Using haemoglobin and soluble transferrin receptor concentrations as individual-level indicators of iron deficiency, we identified country-specific serum ferritin thresholds. We conducted multivariate meta-analysis using individual participant data to assess multinational heterogeneity and intercountry consistency.

Findings

Data were collected from July, 2007 to March, 2019. 18251 individuals (13864 women and 4387 children) were included in the final analysis. The thresholds of pooled serum ferritin levels corresponding to the starting point of decline in circulating haemoglobin concentrations were 24·8 μg/L (95% CI 24·4–25·2) for women and 22·1 μg/L (20·8–23·4) for children based on the national survey data from 12 countries. The thresholds were consistent among countries (p heterogeneity: women = 0·73, children = 0·43) but median serum ferritin concentrations and lower 5% reference ranges differed. In all countries, the prevalence of iron deficiency was higher using physiologically based thresholds than that using WHO current guidelines for women (36·0% [95% CI 25·3–46·8] vs 20·1% [11·5–28·7], p < 0·0001) and for children (34·2% [24·3–44·1] vs 16·6% [11·2–22·0], p < 0·0001).

Interpretation

These results provide evidence that the prevalence of iron deficiency as indicated by physiological measures is substantially higher than those based on current WHO guidelines. The consistency of physiologically based serum ferritin thresholds in apparently healthy women and young children offers a potential means to achieve evidence-informed coordination in thresholds for iron deficiency across populations. The use of physiologically based serum ferritin thresholds could help in detecting the clinical and functional outcomes of iron deficiency.

Funding

### Transferrin saturation and serum ferritin are main predictors of liver iron content in subjects with hyperferritinemia [^114Zehy4]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Hyperferritinemia is widespread and is caused by or associated with a variety of diseases requiring complex diagnostic workup. Magnetic resonance imaging-based liver iron quantification (LIC MRI) can differentiate subjects with iron overload requiring treatment but is still limited to specialized centers and costly. We aimed to determine whether parameters belonging to the diagnostic setting of hyperferritinemia could lead to a more selective use of LIC MRI.

Methods

We enrolled a cohort of 570 subjects with hyperferritinemia from a tertiary hospital center. They underwent full clinical and laboratory evaluation, and LIC MRI. We applied a partitioning tree to explore which features were relevant in classifying LIC MRI, severity from grade 1 to 3.

Results

A total of 66.1% had LIC MRI ≤ 3 mg/g (grade 1), while 11.2% had LIC MRI above 7 mg/g (grade 3). The partitioning tree model showed a global accuracy of 78% (95% confidence interval, 74%-81%) in predicting the severity of LIC MRI in the entire series. Sensitivity and specificity were high to distinguish patients with grade 1 from those with grade 3 but not from patients with grade 2. Focusing on the LIC MRI threshold of 7 mg/g, we found that transferrin saturation (TSAT) ≥ 60% and TSAT < 60% with serum ferritin ≥ 963 μg/L correctly classified 61 (95.3%) subjects with grade 3 LIC MRI to class 3. Based on these cutoffs, 193 subjects with LIC MRI grade 1 and 2 were also selected for LIC MRI assessment, while 316 patients (55.4%) would be addressed to follow-up.

Conclusions

TSAT and serum ferritin allow us to identify more than 95% of patients with a LIC MRI grade 3 and reduce MRI requirements by more than 50%.

### AGA clinical practice update on management of iron deficiency anemia: expert review [^116FymGj]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) with iron deficiency anemia (IDA) — iron supplementation and route selection are as follows: Iron supplementation should be given to all patients with IBD and IDA. In head-to-head comparisons, IV iron had greater efficacy than oral iron in achieving a hemoglobin increase of ≥ 2.0 g/dL (odds ratio, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.13–2.18) and greater treatment continuity (odds ratio, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.13–0.59) in a meta-analysis of 5 randomized controlled trials including 694 adults. Current consensus recommendations by the European Crohn's and Colitis Organization recommend IV over oral iron as first-line therapy for patients with a hemoglobin level < 10 g/dL, but oral iron may be appropriate in carefully selected patients with IBD who have mild anemia and inactive disease; if oral iron is used, close follow-up evaluation is needed to assess tolerance and response.

### Iron deficiency anemia [^1156qyBS]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

The prevalence of iron deficiency anemia is 2 percent in adult men, 9 to 12 percent in non-Hispanic white women, and nearly 20 percent in black and Mexican-American women. Nine percent of patients older than 65 years with iron deficiency anemia have a gastrointestinal cancer when evaluated. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force currently recommends screening for iron deficiency anemia in pregnant women but not in other groups. Routine iron supplementation is recommended for high-risk infants six to 12 months of age. Iron deficiency anemia is classically described as a microcytic anemia. The differential diagnosis includes thalassemia, sideroblastic anemias, some types of anemia of chronic disease, and lead poisoning. Serum ferritin is the preferred initial diagnostic test. Total iron-binding capacity, transferrin saturation, serum iron, and serum transferrin receptor levels may be helpful if the ferritin level is between 46 and 99 ng per mL (46 and 99 mcg per L); bone marrow biopsy may be necessary in these patients for a definitive diagnosis. In children, adolescents, and women of reproductive age, a trial of iron is a reasonable approach if the review of symptoms, history, and physical examination are negative; however, the hemoglobin should be checked at one month. If there is not a 1 to 2 g per dL (10 to 20 g per L) increase in the hemoglobin level in that time, possibilities include malabsorption of oral iron, continued bleeding, or unknown lesion. For other patients, an endoscopic evaluation is recommended beginning with colonoscopy if the patient is older than 50.

### New cut-off values for ferritin and soluble transferrin receptor for the assessment of iron deficiency in children in a high infection pressure area [^1174dZ2h]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Due to the potential risk of iron supplementation in iron replete children, it is important to properly identify children who may require iron supplementation. However, assessment of the iron status has proven to be difficult, especially in children living in areas with high infection pressure (including malaria).

Aims and Methods

Biochemical iron markers were compared to bone marrow iron findings in 381 Malawian children with severe anaemia.

Results

Soluble transferrin receptor/log ferritin (TfR-F index), using a cut-off of 5.6, best predicted bone marrow iron stores deficiency (sensitivity 74%, specificity 73%, accuracy 73%). In order to improve the diagnostic accuracy of ferritin or sTfR as a stand-alone marker, the normal cut-off value needed to be increased by 810% and 83% respectively. Mean cell haemoglobin concentration (MCHC), using a cut-off of 32.1 g/dl, had a sensitivity of 67% and specificity of 64% for detecting iron stores deficiency.

Conclusion

TfR-F index incorporated the high sensitivity of sTfR, a proxy for cellular iron need, and the high specificity of ferritin, a proxy for iron stores. In areas with a high infection pressure, the TfR-F index best predicted iron deficiency. However, in settings where diagnostic tests are limited, MCHC may be an acceptable alternative screening test.

Historical use in nutrition assessment — use of serum albumin in nutrition assessment was first described by Blackburn et al in the classic 1977 publication, "Nutritional and Metabolic Assessment of the Hospitalized Patient", as an important parameter in completing a nutrition assessment, with serum proteins described for use including serum albumin and serum transferrin or its derived marker, total iron-binding capacity. The authors suggested that this nutrition assessment process could be used to identify malnutrition, which could influence morbidity and mortality, and subsequently, serum albumin and transferrin became highly utilized.

### Early detection of type 1 haemochromatosis: a case of normal ferritin levels with elevated transferrin saturation [^115oKwcQ]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Haemochromatosis is marked by excessive iron accumulation leading to damage to various organs. Although haemochromatosis dates to 1865, diagnosing the condition remains challenging due to its non-specific symptoms and due to its quiescent course, it often leads to significant delay in recognition. A woman in her 50s who presented with arthralgia was found to have raised transferrin saturation with normal ferritin. She underwent human homeostatic iron regulator protein (HFE) genetic screening test which showed H63D type 1 haemochromatosis. This report aims to draw attention to the pitfalls in diagnosing haemochromatosis as normal ferritin does not exclude hereditary haemochromatosis.

### ACG clinical guideline: hereditary hemochromatosis [^112T6aP2]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2019). High credibility.

Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) phlebotomy regimen and monitoring — Initial treatment is typically done with weekly removal of 500 mL of blood, with larger volumes, usually 1,000 mL, if tolerated, whereas those who do not tolerate weekly phlebotomies may have smaller volumes removed or increased intervals. Hemoglobin should be checked before and during treatment to ensure it is above 11 g/dL. Serum ferritin (SF) should be checked monthly during phlebotomy until a goal SF level of 50–100 ng/mL is reached. After the SF goal is achieved, the goal of maintenance is to maintain SF levels near 50 ng/mL, and phlebotomy frequency typically is 3–4 times per year.

AGA iron deficiency anemia diagnosis — In patients with anemia, the AGA recommends using a cutoff of 45 ng/mL over 15 ng/mL when using ferritin to diagnose iron deficiency, and in patients with inflammatory conditions or chronic kidney disease, other laboratory tests such as C-reactive protein, transferrin saturation, or soluble transferrin saturation, may be needed in conjunction with ferritin to diagnose iron deficiency anemia.

Oral iron supplementation — product selection, adverse effects, and absorption strategies: Many formulations are available without substantial evidence that any one product is better than another, and ferrous salts (ferrous sulfate, ferrous fumarate, and ferrous gluconate) are a reasonable low-cost starting choice. Side effects are common, with a meta-analysis reporting constipation in 12%, diarrhea in 8%, and nausea in 11%. Serum hepcidin rises after oral dosing and remains increased for up to 48 hours; early data suggest every-other-day dosing appears to improve tolerance but needs better study before implementation. Absorption can be enhanced by taking iron with 80 mg ascorbic acid on an empty stomach, though evidence supporting vitamin C to improve absorption is mixed and needs further clarification. Tea and coffee are powerful inhibitors and should not be consumed within an hour after taking iron. Although absorption is better on an empty stomach, some patients will better tolerate iron with meals; if feasible, taking iron with meat protein will improve absorption, and using 500 mg vitamin C will allow absorption even if calcium or fiber is present in the meal.

### ACG clinical guideline: hereditary hemochromatosis [^116AdNiR]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2019). High credibility.

Hereditary hemochromatosis — iron studies for diagnostic evaluation: Transferrin saturation (TS) is the preferred initial screening test, and fasting is not required to accurately determine TS. A TS of greater than 45% identifies 97.9%–100% of C282Y homozygotes, although a small proportion of patients with HH such as young individuals at an earlier stage may have TS of < 45%. Serum ferritin (SF) is an excellent predictor of advanced fibrosis; in C282Y homozygotes, a SF of > 1,000 ng/mL, in combination with elevated aminotransferase levels and/or low platelet count, predicts cirrhosis in more than 80% of patients. A normal SF, defined as less than 200 ng/mL in premenopausal women or 300 ng/mL in men and postmenopausal women, in combination with a TS of < 45%, has a negative predictive value of 97% for excluding iron overload. A unsaturated iron-binding capacity (UIBC) below 26 μmol/L has a sensitivity of 90% and a specificity of 50% for detecting C282Y homozygosity.

### The ratio of serum transferrin receptor and serum ferritin in the diagnosis of iron status [^112r3dpy]. British Journal of Haematology (2001). Low credibility.

Laboratory tests used in the diagnosis of iron status lack specificity in defining iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) and anaemia of inflammation (AI). The serum transferrin receptor (sTfR) may provide more information in this regard. The iron status of 561 pre-school children was determined and classified using the conventional measurements. The value of the concentration of sTfR, the ratio of sTfR (microg/ml) to LogSF (microg/l) (TfR-Index), and the Log of the ratio of sTfR (microg/l) to SF (microg/l) — (LogTfR:Fer ratio), in the classification of the iron status were determined by comparing their distributions across the classification of iron status. Although there were significant differences in sTfR and TfR-Index across the categories of iron status, there was considerable overlap. All subjects with iron deficiency had LogTfR:Fer ratio > 2.55, whereas in all subjects classified as AI it was < 2.55, thus clearly separating the two. The LogTfR:Fer ratio was not able to exclude IDA in the presence of inflammation. However, in cases of combined IDA and AI the LogTfR:Fer ratio was < 2.55 but increased to > 2.55 after resolution of the inflammation. This novel method of calculating the LogTfR:Fer ratio may provide a more precise classification of the iron status of children.

### Iron deficiency anaemia revisited [^114M6UDR]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Iron deficiency anaemia is a global health concern affecting children, women and the elderly, whilst also being a common comorbidity in multiple medical conditions. The aetiology is variable and attributed to several risk factors decreasing iron intake and absorption or increasing demand and loss, with multiple aetiologies often coexisting in an individual patient. Although presenting symptoms may be nonspecific, there is emerging evidence on the detrimental effects of iron deficiency anaemia on clinical outcomes across several medical conditions. Increased awareness about the consequences and prevalence of iron deficiency anaemia can aid early detection and management. Diagnosis can be easily made by measurement of haemoglobin and serum ferritin levels, whilst in chronic inflammatory conditions, diagnosis may be more challenging and necessitates consideration of higher serum ferritin thresholds and evaluation of transferrin saturation. Oral and intravenous formulations of iron supplementation are available, and several patient and disease-related factors need to be considered before management decisions are made. This review provides recent updates and guidance on the diagnosis and management of iron deficiency anaemia in multiple clinical settings.

### Human transferrin G277S mutation: a risk factor for iron deficiency anaemia [^113s4B7D]. British Journal of Haematology (2001). Low credibility.

Numerous polymorphisms of the transferrin gene result in a range of electrophoretic variants. We show that one of these mutations has a functional consequence. A G→A mutation at cDNA nucleotide 829 (G277S) was associated with a reduction in total iron binding capacity (TIBC). In menstruating white women, the G277S genotype was a risk factor for iron deficiency anaemia: iron deficiency anaemia was present in 27% of homozygous G277S/G277S women, 10% of G277G/G277S heterozygous women and 5% of homozygous wild-type G277G/G277G women.

### Iron deficiency screening is a key issue in chronic inflammatory diseases: a call to action [^111BGSMm]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Iron deficiency is frequent in patients with chronic inflammatory conditions (e.g., chronic heart failure, chronic kidney disease, cancers, and bowel inflammatory diseases). Indeed, high concentrations of inflammatory cytokines increase hepcidin concentrations that lead to the sequestration of iron in cells of the reticuloendothelial system (functional iron deficiency). Iron parameters are often assessed only in the context of anemia, but iron deficiency, even without anemia, is present in about half of patients with inflammatory conditions. Iron deficiency worsens underlying chronic diseases and is an independent factor of morbidity and mortality. In daily practice, the most effective biomarkers of iron status are serum ferritin, which reflects iron storage, and transferrin saturation, which reflects the transport of iron. Serum ferritin is increased in an inflammatory context, and there is still no consensus on the threshold to be used in chronic inflammatory conditions. Nevertheless, recent recommendations of international guidelines agreed to define iron deficiency by serum ferritin < 100 µg/L and/or transferrin saturation < 20%. Iron parameters remain, however, insufficiently assessed in patients with chronic inflammatory conditions. Indeed, clinical symptoms of iron deficiency, such as fatigue, are not specific and often confused with those of the primary disease. Iron repletion, preferably by the intravenous route to bypass tissue sequestration, improves clinical signs and quality of life. Because of the negative impact of iron deficiency on chronic inflammatory diseases and the efficacy of intravenous iron repletion, screening of iron parameters should be part of the routine examination of all patients with chronic inflammatory diseases.

### Laboratory methodologies for indicators of iron status: strengths, limitations, and analytical challenges [^112MALUZ]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2017). Low credibility.

Biochemical assessment of iron status relies on serum-based indicators, such as serum ferritin (SF), transferrin saturation, and soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR), as well as erythrocyte protoporphyrin. These indicators present challenges for clinical practice and national nutrition surveys, and often iron status interpretation is based on the combination of several indicators. The diagnosis of iron deficiency (ID) through SF concentration, the most commonly used indicator, is complicated by concomitant inflammation. sTfR concentration is an indicator of functional ID that is not an acute-phase reactant, but challenges in its interpretation arise because of the lack of assay standardization, common reference ranges, and common cutoffs. It is unclear which indicators are best suited to assess excess iron status. The value of hepcidin, non-transferrin-bound iron, and reticulocyte indexes is being explored in research settings. Serum-based indicators are generally measured on fully automated clinical analyzers available in most hospitals. Although international reference materials have been available for years, the standardization of immunoassays is complicated by the heterogeneity of antibodies used and the absence of physicochemical reference methods to establish "true" concentrations. From 1988 to 2006, the assessment of iron status in NHANES was based on the multi-indicator ferritin model. However, the model did not indicate the severity of ID and produced categorical estimates. More recently, iron status assessment in NHANES has used the total body iron stores (TBI) model, in which the log ratio of sTfR to SF is assessed. Together, sTfR and SF concentrations cover the full range of iron status. The TBI model better predicts the absence of bone marrow iron than SF concentration alone, and TBI can be analyzed as a continuous variable. Additional consideration of methodologies, interpretation of indicators, and analytic standardization is important for further improvements in iron status assessment.

### AGA clinical practice update on management of iron deficiency anemia: expert review [^1114aFns]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

Iron-deficiency anemia and celiac disease — Celiac disease is present in 2% to 6% of asymptomatic patients with IDA; in most patients without another explanation for iron deficiency, anemia will improve after initiation of a strict gluten-free diet without iron supplementation, but up to 20% of patients will remain iron deficient even with strict gluten avoidance. Oral iron is less likely to be effective in patients with more severe degrees of villous atrophy, and IV iron may be indicated in these patients or in patients with more severe symptoms of iron deficiency; IV iron also may be indicated in patients whose iron stores do not recover sufficiently with oral iron and a strict gluten-free diet, and appropriate evaluation of other micronutrient deficiencies, sources of chronic blood loss, or anemia of chronic inflammation should be undertaken in patients whose iron stores are slow to recover.

### Serum ferritin as an indicator of iron status: what do we need to know? [^111C8V5M]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2017). Low credibility.

Determination of iron status in pregnancy and in young children is essential for both clinical and public health practice. Clinical diagnosis of iron deficiency (ID) through sampling of bone marrow to identify the absence of body iron stores is impractical in most cases. Serum ferritin (SF) concentrations are the most commonly deployed indicator for determining ID, and low SF concentrations reflect a state of iron depletion. However, there is considerable variation in SF cutoffs recommended by different expert groups to diagnose ID. Moreover, the cutoffs used in different clinical laboratories are heterogeneous. There are few studies of diagnostic test accuracy to establish the sensitivity and specificity of SF compared with key gold standards (such as absent bone marrow iron stores, increased intestinal iron absorption, and hemoglobin response to SF) among noninflamed, outpatient populations. The limited data available suggest the commonly recommended SF cutoff of < 15 μg/L is a specific but not sensitive cutoff, although evidence is limited. Data from women during pregnancy or from young children are especially uncommon. Most data are from studies conducted > 30 y ago, do not reflect ethnic or geographic diversity, and were performed in an era for which laboratory methods no longer reflect present practice. Future studies to define the appropriate SF cutoffs are urgently needed and would also provide an opportunity to compare this indicator with other established and emerging iron indexes. In addition, future work would benefit from a focus on elucidating cutoffs and indexes relevant to iron adequacy.

### Higher concentrations of serum iron and transferrin saturation but not serum ferritin are associated with cancer outcomes [^114Uqhwk]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Although the carcinogenic potential of iron has been shown, evidence from observational studies that have linked serum iron variables and cancer outcomes has been inconsistent.

Objective

We investigated whether higher iron concentrations increased risk of cancer outcomes.

Design

A prospective examination of iron biomarkers as independent risk factors for cancer was assessed in 1597 men and 1795 women aged 25–79 y who participated in the 1994/1995 Busselton Health Survey and had relevant data, no history of cancer before the survey, and serum ferritin concentrations ≥ 20 μg/L. Follow-up for incident cancers and death from cancer was available to 2010. Proportional hazards regression modeling was performed to investigate if iron status predicted cancer incidence and mortality.

Results

After adjustments for age, smoking, drinking, anthropometric and biochemical variables, or menopausal status (breast cancer), higher serum iron concentrations and transferrin saturation were associated with increased risks of incident nonskin cancer [HR for iron: 1.83 (95% CI: 1.21, 2.76; P < 0.01); HR for transferrin saturation: 1.68 (95% CI: 1.18, 2.38; P < 0.01)] including breast cancer [HR for iron: 2.45 (95% CI:1.12, 5.34; P < 0.05); HR for transferrin saturation: 1.90 (95% CI:1.02, 3.56; P < 0.05)] in women. Transferrin saturation was also associated with a greater risk of cancer death (HR: 2.48; 95% CI: 1.28, 4.82; P < 0.01). In men, higher iron concentrations were associated with reduced risks of incident nonskin cancer (HR: 0.65; 95% CI: 0.42, 0.99; P < 0.05) including colorectal cancer (HR: 0.34; 95% CI: 0.12, 0.95; P < 0.05). There was no association between serum iron and colorectal cancer risk in women. Serum ferritin was not associated with cancer risk or cancer death.

Conclusions

Higher transferrin saturation or serum iron concentrations were associated with increased nonskin cancer risk and increased risk of cancer death. Conversely, in men, higher serum iron concentrations were associated with decreased risk of nonskin cancer. The molecular basis for the observed differences in the association between serum iron and nonskin cancer risk is unclear.

### Diagnosis and management of hemochromatosis: 2011 practice guideline by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^1163FzER]. Hepatology (2011). Medium credibility.

Hemochromatosis diagnostic and initial management algorithm (Fig. 3) outlines stepwise testing beginning with serum transferrin saturation (TS) and ferritin; patients with "TS < 45% and normal ferritin" have "No further evaluation", whereas "TS ≥ 45% and/or elevated ferritin" prompts genotyping and branching such that "Ferritin < 1000 μg/L and normal liver enzymes" leads to "Therapeutic phlebotomy", while "Ferritin > 1000 μg/L or elevated liver enzymes" leads to "Liver biopsy for HIC (hepatic iron concentration) and histopathology"; for the alternative genotype pathway labeled "Compound heterozygote C282Y/H63D C282Y heterozygote or non-C282Y", the action is to "Exclude other liver or hematologic diseases. ± Liver biopsy".

### Disorders of iron metabolism: new diagnostic and treatment approaches to iron deficiency [^117G1BYP]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Iron deficiency anemia is the leading cause of anemia worldwide and affects many young children and adolescent girls in the United States. Its signs and symptoms are subtle despite significant clinical effects. Iron deficiency anemia is diagnosed clinically by the presence of risk factors and microcytic anemia. Improvement following a trial of oral iron therapy is confirmative. An array of iron laboratory tests is available with variable indications. Clinical trial and iron absorption data support a shift to lower-dose oral iron therapy. Intravenous iron should be considered in children who fail oral iron or who have more complex disorders.

### High serum transferrin receptor level in anemia of chronic disorders indicates coexistent iron deficiency [^115LDMYR]. American Journal of Hematology (2003). Low credibility.

Blood transferrin receptor (TR) level is largely determined by the quantum of erythropoiesis and by intracellular iron content of the cells of the erythroid lineage. Hence, a high serum TR level has been found to be useful in distinguishing iron deficiency anemia (IDA) from anemia of chronic disorders (ACD). In order to examine its potential role in the diagnosis of concomitant iron deficiency in ACD, we determined serum TR levels in 130 cases of ACD, in 25 cases of IDA, and in 40 normal adults. As expected, all patients of IDA had significantly higher serum TR levels compared to the normal subjects (4.2–19.2 microg/dL vs. 1.3–3.0 microg/dL) (P < 0.002). In 11/25 cases of IDA, the total iron-binding capacity (TIBC) was in the normal range although bone marrow iron store was absent and serum TR levels were high, thereby highlighting the superiority of TR level in the diagnosis of iron deficiency compared to TIBC. Although 54% (70/130) patients of ACD had normal or low serum TR levels (0.9–3.0 microg/dL) as expected, in 46% (60/130) of ACD patients, serum TR levels were high (3.2–11.0 microg/dL). Mean corpuscular volume, red cell distribution width, and transferrin saturation were significantly lower (P < 0.001) in the latter group of patients compared to the former, and these parameters resembled those in IDA patients. Also, serum iron was lower and TIBC was higher in this group of ACD patients compared to those with normal or low serum TR. All these features point to an "IDA-like" profile of ACD patients with high TR and support the possibility of co-existent iron deficiency in this subgroup of ACD patients. In light of these observations it would be prudent to treat ACD patients with high serum TR levels with iron replacement therapy.

### Assessing iron status: beyond serum ferritin and transferrin saturation [^116DvtSE]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2006). Low credibility.

The increasing prevalence of multiple comorbidities among anemic patients with chronic kidney disease has made the use of serum ferritin and transferrin saturation more challenging in diagnosing iron deficiency. Because serum ferritin is an acute-phase reactant and because the inflammatory state may inhibit the mobilization of iron from reticuloendothelial stores, the scenario of patients with serum ferritin > 800 ng/ml, suggesting iron overload, and transferrin saturation < 20%, suggesting iron deficiency, has become more common. This article revisits the basis for the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative recommendations regarding the use of serum ferritin and transferrin saturation in guiding iron therapy, then explores some of the newer alternative markers for iron status that may be useful when serum ferritin and transferrin saturation are insufficient. These newer tests include reticulocyte hemoglobin content, percentage of hypochromic red cells, and soluble transferrin receptor, all of which have shown some promise in limited studies. Finally, the role of hepcidin, a hepatic polypeptide, in the pathophysiology of iron mobilization is reviewed briefly.

### Discriminating between iron deficiency anemia and anemia of chronic disease using traditional indices of iron status vs transferrin receptor concentration [^1155i1DV]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2001). Low credibility.

We compared the ability of soluble serum transferrin receptor (TfR) concentration, quantified using the R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN) enzyme-linked immunosorbent TfR assay, with other, more traditional indicators of iron status (total iron binding capacity [TIBC], mean corpuscular volume [MCV], percent transferrin saturation [%TS], RBC distribution width [RDW], and serum iron concentration [SIC]) for discriminating between patients with iron deficiency anemia (IDA) or anemia of chronic disease (ACD). The TfR concentration was determined in 72 serum samples selected from men and nonpregnant women classified biochemically on the basis of ferritin concentration as having IDA (n = 41) or ACD (n = 31). By using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, the diagnostic accuracy of the various indicators of iron status that we evaluated for discriminating between IDA and ACD decreased in the following order: TIBC > TfR > MCV > (%TS = RDW) > SIC. There was no significant difference between the diagnostic accuracy of TIBC and TfR. Thus, the routine measurement of TfR offers no advantage over TIBC for discriminating between people with biochemically defined IDA or ACD.

### Evaluation and management of iron deficiency in children undergoing intestinal rehabilitation – A position paper from the NASPGHAN intestinal rehabilitation special interest group [^113HMEuy]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2023). High credibility.

NASPGHAN intestinal rehabilitation — screening and monitoring for iron deficiency (ID) and iron deficiency anemia (IDA): Recommendation: Screening for ID/IDA in children undergoing IR should not be based on a Hb and mean corpuscular volume (MCV) alone. We recommend screening for IDA based on a complete blood count (CBC), SF, TSAT, serum iron concentration, and TIBC (8 authors in favor). Recommendation: A CRP should be obtained while screening for ID as SF is an acute phase reactant (8 authors in favor). Recommendation: Children undergoing IR should be screened for ID/IDA. We recommend screening every 3–6 months (7 authors in favor, 1 opposed). The practice of phlebotomy itself should be re-evaluated in IR, as 1 mL of packed RBC blood loss results in approximately 1 mg of iron loss, so a child with a hematocrit of 40% loses 0.4 mg of iron with each 1 mL of whole blood, or up to 10 mL and 10 mg of iron loss for a basic metabolic panel, magnesium, and phosphorus level depending on the center's draw technique.

### Iron deficiency anemia: diagnosis and management [^116BQgD7]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) still remains universally problematic worldwide. The primary focus of this review is to critique articles published over the past 18 months that describe strategies for the diagnosis and management of this prevalent condition.

Recent Findings

The medical community continues to lack consensus when identifying the optimal approach for the diagnosis and management of IDA. Current diagnostic recommendations revolve around the validity and practicality of current biomarkers such as soluble transferrin-receptor concentrations and others, and cause-based diagnostics that potentially include endoscopy. Management of IDA is based on supplementation combined with effective etiological treatment. Advances in oral and parenteral low-molecular-weight iron preparations has expanded and improved treatment modalities for IDA. Since the introduction of low versus high-molecular-weight intravenous iron administration, there have been fewer serious adverse events associated with parenteral iron preparations.

Summary

Best practice guidelines for diagnosing and managing IDA should include the design of an algorithm that is inclusive of multiple biomarkers and cause-based diagnostics, which will provide direction in managing IDA, and distinguish between IDA from the anemia of chronic disease.

### Association between iron profile status and insulin resistance in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^111ccjWT]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Individuals' burden of insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, is increasing. This indicates to intrigue into various facets of prevention, early screening, prognostication and feasible treatment alternatives in this arena.

Aim

This study targets to evaluate iron profile status among people diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus and normoglycemic in order to deduce association between iron parameters and insulin resistance, if any exist.

Methodology

A case-control study of total 123 subjects, comprising males and females in the age group of 30–70 years were recruited for the study. Case group constituted 81 participants who were diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus and control group constituted 42 healthy individuals who attended routine health check-ups in the hospital. Iron profile parameters including Serum Iron, Serum Ferritin, Total Iron binding Capacity and Glycemic profile parameter like fasting blood glucose, serum insulin were estimated. Transferrin saturation and HOMA-IR were calculated.

Result

Ferritin and Transferrin saturation was found to be higher in cases than in controls with significance of p = 0.003 and p = 0.021 respectively and TIBC (total iron-binding capacity) was lesser in cases with p = 0.031. Comparison of Serum Iron values did not yield a significant result. Correlation study between ferritin and insulin resistance parameters yielded a satisfactory result in the cases (p < 0.05) and controls (p < 0.01) separately.

Conclusion

This study implies that there is a clear link between iron profile status, notably ferritin, and the emergence of insulin resistance, and hence insulin production. This study supports the function of the micronutrient iron in the etiology of type 2 diabetes and its consequences.
