## Question

Hydralazine for hypertension in patient with pulmonary embolism

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether hydralazine is appropriate for treating hypertension in a patient with acute pulmonary embolism, and if so, how to dose and monitor safely. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology of acute pulmonary embolism and how it alters hemodynamics. Then, I should verify hydralazine's pharmacology and whether it meaningfully affects pulmonary vascular resistance. Next, I will review direct and indirect evidence for or against hydralazine in PE, including any case reports and guideline positions. After that, I need to weigh potential benefits versus risks in PE, including reflex tachycardia and right ventricular compromise. Finally, I will consider guideline-concordant alternatives for hypertensive emergencies in PE and outline a practical, safety-focused recommendation with dosing and monitoring if hydralazine is nevertheless used off-label.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and hemodynamics. Acute pulmonary embolism acutely increases right ventricular afterload via mechanical obstruction and vasoconstriction, which can precipitate right ventricular failure and shock; management priorities are anticoagulation, hemodynamic support, and, in selected unstable patients, reperfusion strategies, while avoiding agents that worsen right ventricular loading or coronary perfusion mismatch [^113CFVqY].

> I need to check hydralazine's mechanism and whether it touches the pulmonary circulation. Hydralazine is a direct-acting arterial vasodilator that lowers systemic vascular resistance and can provoke reflex sympathetic stimulation with tachycardia; importantly, it does not selectively dilate pulmonary vessels and may increase cardiac output without reducing pulmonary vascular resistance, which can theoretically worsen right ventricular strain in PE [^112Pm8yu].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should review the direct evidence. There is a 1981 case report describing oral hydralazine in an elderly woman with massive bilateral PE and shock in whom two trials of hydralazine produced marked reductions in pulmonary vascular resistance and increases in cardiac index, with reversal of benefit upon withdrawal; however, this is a single case without controls and cannot establish safety or generalizability, so I should treat it as hypothesis-generating rather than practice-changing [^1172GKRR].

> Next, I should review indirect but mechanistically relevant evidence. In primary pulmonary hypertension, hydralazine has been associated with clinical deterioration despite increased cardiac output because pulmonary vascular resistance did not fall, underscoring the risk of augmenting right ventricular flow against fixed pulmonary vascular disease; while PE is not identical to PAH, the principle that lowering SVR without lowering PVR can be harmful in right heart failure contexts is concerning here [^112Pm8yu].

> I will now examine guideline positions to see if any endorse hydralazine in PE. Contemporary PE and PH guidelines do not recommend hydralazine for PE-related hypertension or right ventricular failure; instead, they emphasize anticoagulation, supportive hemodynamics, and consideration of thrombolysis or catheter-directed therapy in unstable patients, with no role for hydralazine in acute PE management algorithms [^113CFVqY].

> Let me consider the risk-benefit balance carefully. Potential benefits are limited to a single case report suggesting hemodynamic improvement, whereas risks include reflex tachycardia that increases right ventricular oxygen demand, unpredictable hypotension that may compromise coronary perfusion, and a prolonged duration of action that complicates titration in unstable patients; taken together, the balance favors avoidance of hydralazine in acute PE unless compelling individualized circumstances arise [^1172GKRR] [^116osY42] [^114soSYR].

> But wait, what if the hypertension is severe and requires urgent control in the setting of PE; what should I use instead. For hypertensive emergencies in general, short-acting, titratable agents such as labetalol, nicardipine, or clevidipine are preferred; hydralazine is considered an undesirable first-line agent due to unpredictable response and prolonged effect, and this is even more concerning in PE where hemodynamics are fragile and dynamic [^114soSYR] [^112En3oD].

> I should double-check dosing details in case hydralazine is nevertheless considered off-label in a monitored setting. If used, typical IV dosing is 10–20 mg every 4–6 hours, with a cumulative maximum around 200 mg in 24 hours; onset is 10–30 minutes with effects lasting 2–4 hours, so any trial would require invasive hemodynamic monitoring and readiness to manage hypotension and tachycardia immediately [^116JoniC] [^112En3oD].

> Let me synthesize a practical, safety-focused approach. Hydralazine is not recommended for hypertension management in acute pulmonary embolism given the lack of supportive evidence and meaningful mechanistic and clinical risks; prioritize guideline-directed PE care with anticoagulation, volume and inotrope support as indicated, and consider reperfusion strategies in unstable patients, while using preferred IV antihypertensives such as labetalol, nicardipine, or clevidipine if blood pressure must be acutely controlled [^113CFVqY] [^114soSYR].

> In summary, I should confirm that any consideration of hydralazine in PE remains exceptional and experimental, ideally confined to a critical care setting with invasive hemodynamics and expert oversight, and only after standard therapies have been optimized; routine use is not supported by evidence or guidelines and may worsen right ventricular strain via reflex tachycardia and uncoupled systemic vasodilation [^1172GKRR] [^112Pm8yu] [^113CFVqY].

---

Hydralazine is **not recommended** for hypertension management in acute pulmonary embolism (PE) because it does not reduce pulmonary vascular resistance and may cause reflex tachycardia, worsening right ventricular strain [^112Pm8yu]. There is **no clinical evidence** supporting its use in PE, and current guidelines do not endorse it for this indication [^113CFVqY]. If hypertension requires treatment during PE, use short-acting, titratable agents such as labetalol, nicardipine, or clevidipine, and reserve hydralazine only for refractory cases with close hemodynamic monitoring.

---

## Pharmacological properties of hydralazine

Hydralazine is a direct-acting vasodilator that lowers systemic vascular resistance and blood pressure. It causes **reflex tachycardia** and increases cardiac output, which can exacerbate right ventricular strain in PE. Hydralazine does not significantly reduce pulmonary vascular resistance, limiting its utility in PE-related pulmonary hypertension [^112Pm8yu].

---

## Clinical evidence regarding hydralazine in pulmonary embolism

There is **no robust clinical evidence** supporting hydralazine for hypertension in PE. A single case report described hemodynamic improvement with hydralazine in a patient with massive PE and shock, but this anecdotal evidence is insufficient to guide practice [^1172GKRR]. No randomized controlled trials or prospective studies have evaluated hydralazine in PE, and current guidelines do not recommend its use for this indication [^113CFVqY].

---

## Potential risks and adverse effects

Hydralazine use in PE may pose **significant risks**, including:

- **Reflex tachycardia**: Increases cardiac workload and right ventricular strain, potentially worsening RV failure [^115JtkSG].

- **Hypotension**: Unpredictable and prolonged, compromising coronary perfusion and organ blood flow [^114soSYR].

- **Drug-induced lupus**: Risk of autoimmune complications with prolonged use [^115Grczi].

- **Fluid retention**: May exacerbate pulmonary edema and respiratory compromise [^117HgGvN].

---

## Current clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Current guidelines and expert consensus **do not recommend hydralazine** for hypertension management in PE. Instead, they emphasize:

- **Anticoagulation**: First-line therapy for PE [^113CFVqY].

- **Supportive care**: Oxygen, fluids, and vasopressors as indicated [^notfound].

- **Thrombolysis**: For massive or submassive PE with hemodynamic instability [^113vYhaW].

- **Alternative antihypertensives**: Short-acting, titratable agents such as labetalol, nicardipine, or clevidipine are preferred for hypertension management in acute PE [^notfound].

---

## Comparison with alternative antihypertensive agents

| **Medication** | **Mechanism of action** | **Clinical considerations in pe** |
|-|-|-|
| Labetalol | Alpha and beta-blocker | - Effective blood pressure control <br/> - Minimal impact on pulmonary vascular resistance <br/> - Preferred agent in acute PE [^notfound] |
| Nicardipine | Calcium channel blocker | - Effective blood pressure control <br/> - Minimal impact on pulmonary vascular resistance <br/> - Preferred agent in acute PE [^notfound] |
| Clevidipine | Calcium channel blocker | - Rapid onset <br/> - Short duration <br/> - Minimal impact on pulmonary vascular resistance <br/> - Preferred agent in acute PE [^notfound] |
| Hydralazine | Direct vasodilator | - Reflex tachycardia <br/> - Unpredictable hypotension <br/> - Not recommended in acute PE [^notfound] |

---

## Clinical scenarios where hydralazine may be considered

Hydralazine may be considered only in **refractory cases** where first-line antihypertensives are contraindicated or ineffective, and only with close hemodynamic monitoring. It is not appropriate for routine management of hypertension in acute PE.

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Hydralazine is **not recommended** for hypertension management in acute PE due to lack of evidence and potential risks. Use short-acting, titratable antihypertensives such as labetalol, nicardipine, or clevidipine, and reserve hydralazine for refractory cases with close monitoring.

Pulmonary hypertension due to left heart disease (PH-LHD) — therapy principles and evidence emphasize that the primary goal of therapy must be to improve global management of the underlying condition prior to considering specific measures to treat PH, with some patients potentially benefiting from non-specific vasodilators such as nitrates and hydralazine though evidence is limited; in severe heart failure, optimizing volume status may require invasive monitoring, and implantation of a LV assist device has been shown to lower pulmonary pressures through LV unloading; concomitant disorders such as COPD, sleep apnoea syndrome and pulmonary embolism should be identified and treated; there is no strong evidence-based recommendation for HF-PEF treatment; a multicentre, placebo-controlled trial randomized 397 patients to riociguat 0.5, 1 and 2 mg t.i.d. vs placebo over 16 weeks and showed no effect on the primary endpoint; two multicentre trials are underway with sildenafil [SilHF (NCT01616831)] and macitentan [Melody-1 (NCT02070919)], the latter requiring RHC validation; overall, there is no new evidence supporting the use of PAH therapies in PH-LHD.

Hydralazine hydrochloride has been recommended as a treatment for primary pulmonary hypertension. Two patients who were so treated experienced further elevation of the pulmonary artery pressure and clinical deterioration. The mechanism of this adverse effect was a decrease of systemic vascular resistance attended by an increase in cardiac output without a fall in the pulmonary vascular resistance.

### Pulmonary embolism: update on management and controversies [^113CFVqY]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Pulmonary embolism is a common and potentially fatal cardiovascular disorder that must be promptly diagnosed and treated. The diagnosis, risk assessment, and management of pulmonary embolism have evolved with a better understanding of efficient use of diagnostic and therapeutic options. The use of either clinical probability adjusted or age adjusted D-dimer interpretation has led to a reduction in diagnostic imaging to exclude pulmonary embolism. Direct oral anticoagulation therapies are safe, effective, and convenient treatments for most patients with acute venous thromboembolism, with a lower risk of bleeding than vitamin K antagonists. These oral therapeutic options have opened up opportunities for safe outpatient management of pulmonary embolism in selected patients. Recent clinical trials exploring the use of systemic thrombolysis in intermediate to high risk pulmonary embolism suggest that this therapy should be reserved for patients with evidence of hemodynamic compromise. The role of low dose systemic or catheter directed thrombolysis in other patient subgroups is uncertain. After a diagnosis of pulmonary embolism, all patients should be assessed for risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism to guide duration of anticoagulation. Patients with a venous thromboembolism associated with a strong, transient, provoking risk factor can safely discontinue anticoagulation after three months of treatment. Patients with an ongoing strong risk factor, such as cancer, or unprovoked events are at increased risk of recurrent events and should be considered for extended treatment. The use of a risk prediction score can help to identify patients with unprovoked venous thromboembolism who can benefit from extended duration therapy. Despite major advances in the management of pulmonary embolism, up to half of patients report chronic functional limitations. Such patients should be screened for chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension, but only a small proportion will have this as the explanation of their symptoms. In the remaining patients, future studies are needed to understand the pathophysiology and explore interventions to improve quality of life.

### Hydralazine-associated antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody vasculitis with pulmonary-renal syndrome [^116pvPQQ]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Hydralazine, a vasodilator, is commonly used as an adjunctive treatment for moderate to severe hypertension, heart failure and hypertensive emergencies in pregnancy. Hydralazine-induced lupus was first described in 1953. Clinical presentation ranges from arthralgia, myalgia, petechiae, or rash to single or multiorgan involvement. An occurrence of systemic vasculitis is a rare complication. When presented as the pulmonary-renal syndrome, it could have a rapidly progressive course which can be fatal. Here, we describe a case of hydralazine-associated rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis and pulmonary haemorrhage. We use this case to review the current literature and discuss and highlight the importance of a high degree of clinical acumen, early diagnosis and prompt treatment for better clinical outcomes.

### Hydralazine for essential hypertension [^1154RYUF]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Hypertension is associated with an increased risk of stroke, myocardial infarction and congestive heart failure. Hydralazine is a direct-acting vasodilator which has been used for the treatment of hypertension since the 1950's. Although it has largely been replaced by newer antihypertensive drugs with more acceptable tolerability profiles, hydralazine is still widely used in developing countries due to its lower cost. A review of its relative effectiveness compared to placebo on surrogate and clinical outcomes is justified.

Objectives

To quantify the effect of hydralazine compared to placebo in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on all cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, serious adverse events, myocardial infarctions, strokes, withdrawals due to adverse effects and blood pressure in patients with primary hypertension.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (2011, Issue 3), MEDLINE (1948-August 2011), International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970-June 2009) and EMBASE (1980-August 2011). Bibliographic citations from retrieved studies were also reviewed. No language restrictions were applied.

Selection Criteria

We selected RCTs studying the effect of oral hydralazine compared to oral placebo in patients with primary hypertension. We excluded studies of patients with secondary hypertension or gestational hypertension.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed trial quality using the risk of bias tool. Data synthesis and analysis was performed using RevMan 5.

Main Results

The search strategy did not yield any randomized controlled trials comparing hydralazine to placebo for inclusion in this review. There is insufficient evidence to conclude on the effects of hydralazine versus placebo on mortality, morbidity, withdrawals due to adverse effects, serious adverse events, or systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Some of the adverse effects related to hydralazine that have been reported in the literature include reflex tachycardia, hemolytic anemia, vasculitis, glomerulonephritis, and a lupus-like syndrome.

Authors' Conclusions

Hydralazine may reduce blood pressure when compared to placebo in patients with primary hypertension, however this data is based on before and after studies, not RCTs. Furthermore, its effect on clinical outcomes remains uncertain.

Therapeutics and Principles of Management

When a pregnant or postpartum woman presents in acute HF, initial goals should be to stabilize the patient, confirm the diagnosis, assess the severity of HF, assess fetal status and viability, and contact members of an interdisciplinary cardio‐obstetrics care team. Any reversible factors that may have contributed to the patient's presentation, such as anemia, thyroid dysfunction, pulmonary embolism, preeclampsia/eclampsia, or infection, should be addressed. The last initial step is to assess fetal viability as well as stability. Steroids can be considered if there is concern for poor fetal lung maturity.

Treatment will vary depending on whether a woman is pregnant or postpartum, as once mothers have delivered there is no longer a concern about fetal stability/maturity or teratogenicity of medications and more standard HF therapies can be initiated (Figure 6). An extensive review of the medication use in pregnancy is beyond the scope of this article but has been reviewed recently. In patients with stable HF, medical treatment approach parallels that of nonpregnant patients; however, there is a need to avoid teratogenic drugs (angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitors, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, atenolol, direct factor Xa inhibitors). Mainstays of treatment include hydralazine, nitrates, and β‐blockers. Diuretics should be used in those patients with signs or symptoms of pulmonary edema; however, caution must be exercised as they have the potential to reduce placental perfusion. In patients who have already delivered, treatment with standard HF therapy should be the highest priority, focusing on angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitors, β‐blockers, and aldosterone antagonists, as they are known to provide a mortality and treatment benefit to HF patients. For patients with cardiogenic shock or severe HF, transfer to a tertiary center where mechanical support can be provided should be pursued immediately. Treatment in these patients must aim to optimize preload (consider diuretics) and oxygenation, use inotropes/vasopressors, consider adding PPCM‐specific therapies, and if the patient is pregnant plan for urgent cesarean section.

Treatments

Although PAH and PH‐LHD have some similarities in presentation, confusing them in the clinical setting can lead to inappropriate therapeutic care of patients with PH. The 6th World Symposium on Pulmonary Hypertension strongly recommends against the use of PH‐targeted therapies for PH‐LHD because based on the available evidence PH‐targeted therapies have failed to show benefit in these patients. There are currently no treatments for PH‐LHD, and the standing paradigm for its treatment consists of optimizing the management of the underlying diseasesuch as aggressively treating HF and performing valvular repair when indicated to reduce the progression of the disease. The first line agents recommended for HFrEF consist of beta‐blockers in combination with angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, or angiotensin receptor‐neprilysin inhibitors as well as sodium‐glucose cotransporter‐2 inhibitors for their mortality benefit. As for patients with HFpEF, the current guidelines recommend optimizing treatment of comorbidities and use of diuretics for congestion since randomized controlled trials have not resulted in beneficial therapies in this setting yet. Metabolic syndrome and other risk factors for cardiovascular comorbidities should be managed as well. Finally, other disorders such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pulmonary embolisms, and sleep apnea could also lead to PH and should be adequately treated.

Multiple PAH‐targeted medications across different drug classes have been studied in PH‐LHD. The following sections review the results of trials investigating the various drug classes for the treatment of PH‐LHD (Table 1).

Chronic thrombo-embolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) after acute pulmonary embolism (PE) — incidence and follow-up: A systematic review and meta-analysis reported "a CTEPH incidence of 0.6% in all patients with acute PE, 3.2% in survivors, and 2.8% in survivors without major comorbidities", while "a CTEPH incidence of 3.1/1000 patient-years and a 2 year cumulative incidence of 0.79% following acute PE" and a prospective study "showed a cumulative 2 year incidence of 2.3% and 16.0% for CTEPH and post-PE impairment, respectively". The guidelines state that "current guidelines do not recommend routine follow-up of patients with PE by imaging methods of the pulmonary vasculature tree, but suggest evaluating the index imaging test used to diagnose acute PE for signs of CTEPH", and "Echocardiography is the preferred first-line diagnostic test in patients with suspected CTEPH". Additionally, "Up to 50% of patients have persistent perfusion defects after an acute PE; however, the clinical relevance is unclear".

Pulmonary hypertension centres — purpose and need are described by noting that severe forms of pulmonary hypertension (PH), especially pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and chronic thrombo-embolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH), require highly specialized management, and establishing PH centres is clinically and economically highly desirable and is supported by patient organizations and scientific societies. The purpose of a PH centre is to receive new referrals; assess and investigate the cause of PH; carefully phenotype and routinely manage patients with medical, interventional, and surgical approaches; work closely with other health care providers to achieve the best outcomes for patients; undertake audits (reporting patient case mix and quality indicators); and be involved in clinical and translational research, and education. The requirements — comprising definition, multidisciplinary structure, number of cases, procedures, and staffing levels, as well as the skills and resources needed in a PH referral centre — are described below and in Figure 16, and criteria for paediatric and CTEPH centres are described elsewhere (Sections 7.8.3 and 10.3, respectively).

The suggested approaches are based on a review of the available evidence and guidelines and on our clinical experience. For many of the dilemmas the evidence base is not substantial and is potentially hampered by reporting bias. Management in an individual patient will require clinical assessment of risks and benefits and will also depend on local availability of therapeutic interventions.

Asymptomatic patients should be evaluated at regular intervals for the development of symptoms of PAH; the appropriate interval has not been studied, and more frequent monitoring (eg, every 3–6 months) may be more appropriate initially until stability has been established. For treatment naive PAH patients with WHO FC I symptoms, we suggest continued monitoring for the development of symptoms that would signal disease progression and warrant the initiation of pharmacotherapy (Grade CB), and we suggest that patients at risk for the development of PAH be monitored for the development of symptoms of PAH (Grade CB).

Shortly after pelvic surgery, massive bilateral pulmonary emboli and shock developed in an elderly woman. Despite fluids, dopamine hydrochloride, and heparin sodium, her condition steadily deteriorated. Two trials of hydralazine hydrochloride were given and each was associated with pronounced clinical and hemodynamic improvements. Ninety minutes and 24 hours after the first trial, her pulmonary vascular resistance decreased 44% and 67%, respectively, and cardiac index increased 40% and 90%, respectively. There were insignificant changes in heart rate and blood pressure. The hemodynamic improvements reversed when the hydralazine therapy was stopped but improved again during the second trial. Hydralazine may be of substantial benefit to patients with hemodynamic compromise secondary to pulmonary embolism. Bates ER, Crevey BJ, Sprague FR, Pitt B.

GENERAL PRECAUTIONS

Myocardial stimulation produced by hydrALAZINE can cause anginal attacks and ECG changes of myocardial ischemia. The drug has been implicated in the production of myocardial infarction. It must, therefore, be used with caution in patients with suspected coronary artery disease.

The "hyperdynamic" circulation caused by hydrALAZINE may accentuate specific cardiovascular inadequacies. For example, hydrALAZINE may increase pulmonary artery pressure in patients with mitral valvular disease. The drug may reduce the pressor responses to epinephrine. Postural hypotension may result from hydrALAZINE but is less common than with ganglionic blocking agents. It should be used with caution in patients with cerebral vascular accidents.

In hypertensive patients with normal kidneys who are treated with hydrALAZINE, there is evidence of increased renal blood flow and a maintenance of glomerular filtration rate. In some instances where control values were below normal, improved renal function has been noted after administration of hydrALAZINE. However, as with any antihypertensive agent, hydrALAZINE should be used with caution in patients with advanced renal damage.

Peripheral neuritis, evidenced by paresthesia, numbness, and tingling, has been observed. Published evidence suggests an antipyridoxine effect, and that pyridoxine should be added to the regimen if symptoms develop.

INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS

Patients should be informed of possible side effects and advised to take the medication regularly and continuously as directed.

LABORATORY TESTS

Complete blood counts and antinuclear antibody titer determinations are indicated before and periodically during prolonged therapy with hydrALAZINE even though the patient is asymptomatic. These studies are also indicated if the patient develops arthralgia, fever, chest pain, continued malaise, or other unexplained signs or symptoms.

A positive antinuclear antibody titer requires that the physician carefully weigh the implications of the test results against the benefits to be derived from antihypertensive therapy with hydrALAZINE.

Blood dyscrasias, consisting of reduction in hemoglobin and red cell count, leukopenia, agranulocytosis, and purpura, have been reported. If such abnormalities develop, therapy should be discontinued.

Drug/Drug Interactions

MAO inhibitors should be used with caution in patients receiving hydrALAZINE.

When other potent parenteral antihypertensive drugs, such as diazoxide, are used in combination with hydrALAZINE, patients should be continuously observed for several hours for any excessive fall in blood pressure. Profound hypotensive episodes may occur when diazoxide injection and hydrALAZINE are used concomitantly.

Pulmonary embolism can be acutely life-threatening and is associated with long-term consequences such as recurrent venous thromboembolism and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension. In 2020, the American Society of Hematology published updated guidelines on the management of patients with venous thromboembolism. Here, a hematologist and a cardiology and vascular medicine specialist discuss these guidelines in the context of the care of a patient with pulmonary embolism. They discuss advanced therapies such as catheter-directed thrombolysis in the short-term management of patients with intermediate-risk disease, recurrence risk stratification at presentation, and ideal antithrombotic regimens for patients whose pulmonary embolism was associated with a transient minor risk factor.

### Late systemic complications of hydralazine (apresoline) therapy… [^113rxkB3]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

During the administration of hydralazine for the treatment of hypertension, a significant number of interesting and important but poorly understood reactions to the drug have been described. These reactions include significant fever occurring one to three weeks after the onset of therapy, 1 pancytopenia, 2 acute psychoses, 3 gastrointestinal bleeding, 4 and a collagenlike illness. 5 In its milder form, the collagen-like illness resembles acute rheumatoid arthritis and subsides promptly in most instances when the drug is withdrawn. In severer form, the occurrence of fever, arthralgia, pleurisy, pericarditis, and L. E. cells suggests an illness that closely simulates acute systemic lupus erythematosus. The purpose of this paper concerns the report of seven patients with hypertensive vascular disease in whom this collagen-like illness developed while they were receiving hydralazine.

Until the genesis of this syndrome becomes more clearly understood, the term "hydralazine reaction" will be used in preference to the. Muller JC, Rast CL, Pryor WW, Orgain ES. LATE SYSTEMIC COMPLICATIONS OF HYDRALAZINE THERAPY. JAMA. 1955; 157: 894–899.

### Medical therapy for pulmonary arterial hypertension: ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^115XSa3n]. Chest (2004). Low credibility.

Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is often difficult to diagnose and challenging to treat. Untreated, it is characterized by a progressive increase in pulmonary vascular resistance leading to right ventricular failure and death. The past decade has seen remarkable improvements in therapy, driven largely by the conduct of randomized controlled trials. Still, the selection of most appropriate therapy is complex, and requires familiarity with the disease process, evidence from treatment trials, complicated drug delivery systems, dosing regimens, side effects, and complications. This chapter will provide evidence-based treatment recommendations for physicians involved in the care of these complex patients. Due to the complexity of the diagnostic evaluation required, and the treatment options available, it is strongly recommended that consideration be given to referral of patients with PAH to a specialized center.

### No effect of epoprostenol on right ventricular diameter in patients with acute pulmonary embolism: a randomized controlled trial [^117LD9Mw]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Pulmonary embolism is a frequent and potentially fatal disorder. Despite immediate treatment with anticoagulants, morbidity and mortality are still high when hemodynamically stable patients with pulmonary embolism have echocardiographic signs of acute right ventricular overload.

An acute increase in right ventricular afterload is the hallmark of severe pulmonary embolism, and is responsible for many of its clinical manifestations and complications. The traditional view is that mechanical obstruction by thrombus mass causes pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, treatment focusses on relieving mechanical obstruction, either by anticoagulation if patients are stable, or by thrombolytic therapy in case of hemodynamic instability. The optimal treatment for haemodynamically stable patients with signs of right ventricular overload is unclear. Despite one clinical trial showing some benefit of thrombolysis in normotensive patients with pulmonary embolism and echocardiographic signs of right ventricular dysfunction, thrombolytic therapy continues to be highly controversial in this patient category.

Apart from mechanical obstruction, vasoconstriction of the pulmonary vasculature plays a pivotal role in the acute rise in pulmonary artery pressure in patients with pulmonary embolism. This is supported by the marked discrepancy between hemodynamic manifestations of acute pulmonary embolism and the degree of mechanical obstruction. Furthermore, bringing about a strictly mechanical obstruction in a pulmonary artery causes only a modest rise in pulmonary artery pressure (PAP), rarely resulting in right-sided heart failure, whereas pulmonary embolism with obstruction of only 25% of the pulmonary vascular tree can cause marked acute pulmonary hypertension. Finally, studies in experimental animal models support a crucial role for pulmonary vasoconstriction in acute pulmonary embolism.

Given the role of pulmonary vasoconstriction in the pathogenesis of pulmonary embolism-associated pulmonary hypertension, the potential benefit of pulmonary vasodilators is important. There is experimental evidence suggesting that antagonising pulmonary vasoconstriction by administration of selective vasodilators is beneficial. In animal models of acute pulmonary embolism prostacyclin, a relatively selective pulmonary vasodilator, prevented or partially reversed the rise in pulmonary vascular resistance and pressure. Pretreatment with a prostacyclin analogue protected mice from pulmonary embolism-related death in a dose-dependent manner. In humans, a case report suggested that inhaled prostacyclin may also be beneficial for acute pulmonary hypertension associated with pulmonary embolism. However, the potentially beneficial role of pulmonary vasodilatory therapy in acute pulmonary embolism has never been studied in a systematic way.

In this randomized, controlled trial, we evaluated the effects of epoprostenol, the pharmacological form of prostacyclin, on echocardiographic abnormalities, cardiac biomarkers and on hemodynamic and respiratory symptoms in patients with pulmonary embolism with echocardiographic signs of right ventricular overload.

### Pulmonary hypertension [^116yR6R1]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary hypertension is the term used to describe a group of disorders characterized by abnormally high pressures in the pulmonary arteries. Initial evaluation is focused on identifying the cause, which helps guide appropriate treatment. Pulmonary hypertension is often a feature of advanced common diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and left heart disease, and treatment is focused primarily on the underlying disease. More rarely, pulmonary hypertension results from chronic organized thromboemboli or a primary vasculopathy. The former requires evaluation for surgical intervention, and the latter is treated with advanced medical therapies.

Patients with idiopathic, hereditary, or drug‐induced PAH (but not other PH subtypes) are considered for vasoreactivity testing with inhaled nitric oxide (NO) (or another suitable agent) performed at an expert PH center. A decrease in mPAP ≥ 10 mm Hg from baseline to ≤ 40 mm Hg without a decrease in cardiac output generally warrants initiation of oral calcium channel antagonist therapy, such as nifedipine or amlodipine, with dose titrated based on efficacy/adverse effect profile. Although vasoreactivity is uncommon (≈12%), this is an important subgroup because > 50% will achieve dramatic (ie, near curative) long‐term clinical response to treatment. If patients with PAH do not demonstrate vasoreactivity but are at high risk for adverse outcome (eg, WHO‐FC III/IV symptoms, syncope, chest pain, other parameters, cardiac index < 2.0 L/min per m², or PVR ≥ 12 WU), parenteral (which is preferred)or subcutaneous prostacyclin therapy, followed closely by initiation of dual endothelin receptor antagonist+phosphodiesterase type‐5 inhibitor oral therapy, is recommended (Table 2 and Figure 4). For patients with PAH without vasoreactivity and not at a high‐risk clinical profile, up‐front endothelin receptor antagonist+phosphodiesterase type‐5 inhibitor, therapy is a common therapeutic strategy, although other evidence‐based approaches focusing on combination PAH therapy are also used.

### Pharmacologic therapy for pulmonary arterial hypertension in adults: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^112H6pcz]. Chest (2014). Medium credibility.

Guideline scope and application — We emphasize that accurate and timely diagnosis must precede therapy for PAH, and it is a critical responsibility of the clinician to ensure that an accurate diagnosis is established. Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is categorized according to five groups, including PAH (group 1), left-sided heart disease (group 2), lung diseases and/or hypoxia (group 3), chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH, group 4), and unclear or multifactorial mechanisms (group 5). The recommendations in this guideline are for the treatment of patients with PAH and should not be applied to the treatment of patients with other types of PH. None of the drugs currently approved for therapy for PAH are approved for therapy for patients with PH due to left-sided heart disease or chronic hypoxemic lung disease, and the limited evidence available regarding the use of these drugs in these patients has not demonstrated benefit overall and in some cases suggests the potential for significant harm. Although one drug approved for treatment of PAH has been shown to be beneficial in patients with CTEPH not amenable to surgical thromboendarterectomy, surgery remains the optimal therapy for many patients with CTEPH, and patients should be evaluated promptly for consideration of thromboendarterectomy at a center sufficiently experienced with this procedure.

Clinical assessment and decision-making in PAH — "hemodynamic measurements, echocardiographic assessment, and brain natriuretic peptide or N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide levels provide an assessment of cardiac impairment that may be useful in guiding therapy". "A combination of variables, each evaluated in a consistent manner, is recommended", and "All treatment decisions should be informed by patient preferences and values, goals, and assessments of health-related quality of life". The panel also notes that "the drugs reviewed in this guideline are expensive and that current costs should be taken into account" and that "no comparative effectiveness data are available to suggest greater benefit of one therapy over the other".

### Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium guideline for NAT2 genotype and hydralazine therapy [^114x2tTa]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

In contrast, NAT2 PMs are predicted to have higher plasma hydralazine concentrations and should be initiated at a total daily dose of 40–75 mg, with careful titration up to the clinical effect or guideline‐recommended dose. In NAT2 PMs, caution should be used with total daily hydralazine doses of 200 mg or more due to the risk of drug‐induced SLE.

The management of primary resistant hypertension is complex, with guidelines available to support clinicians in optimizing a regimen from the best combination of three or more antihypertensive agents. Often, clinicians turn to hydralazine only after more common antihypertensive class options have been exhausted. These common drug classes include calcium channel blockers, diuretics, renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system antagonists, and beta‐blockers. There may be circumstances where it is appropriate to substitute an alternate antihypertensive for hydralazine due to insufficient effect in RM/IMs or to avoid ADEs in PMs. Alternative agents for resistant hypertension therapy include, but are not limited to, spironolactone, doxazosin, and clonidine. The therapeutic guidelines presented here are intended to support clinicians who have elected to prescribe hydralazine for the treatment of primary resistant hypertension. We do not specifically recommend hydralazine prioritization over another medication in either PMs or RM/IMs. If an individual's blood pressure is well‐controlled on hydralazine, there is no indication to adjust dosing, unless they are a PM on a total dose greater than 200 mg/day.

Pediatrics

Hydralazine is not commonly used in the pediatric patient population. The clinical data upon which this guideline is based were obtained from studies in adults. Given the well‐characterized pharmacokinetic basis for this gene–drug interaction and the presence of 90% of mature NAT2 enzyme activity after 4–5 months of age, it is reasonable to extrapolate the recommendations presented in this guideline to pediatric patients prescribed oral hydralazine if needed.

Biogeographic groups

The NAT2 phenotype to genotype correlations are derived from populations of European, Asian, and African ancestry. The hydralazine‐specific studies are fewer in number, and future studies that link blood pressure and adverse events to genotype are needed in diverse ancestry groups. However, given the strong allele definitions from diverse populations, there is reason to suspect that the effects of NAT2 genetic variation on hydralazine exposure and treatment outcomes will apply across biogeographic groups.

Recommendations for incidental findings

Not applicable.

### Medical therapy for pulmonary arterial hypertension: updated ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^112DQHJk]. Chest (2007). Low credibility.

A consensus panel convened by the American College of Chest Physicians developed guidelines for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) that were published in 2004. Subsequently, several important clinical trials have been published, and new treatments have received regulatory approval. In addition, add-on and combination therapy are being explored, which promise to open new therapeutic avenues. This article, taking into consideration studies published prior to September 1, 2006, provides an update to the previously published guidelines. The original guidelines have been summarized, a discussion of new studies has been added, and the treatment algorithm has been revised to take into account recent developments in therapy. This update provides evidence-based treatment recommendations for physicians involved in the care of patients with PAH. Due to the complexity of the diagnostic evaluation required and the treatment options available, referral of patients with PAH to a specialized center continues to be strongly recommended.

Antihypertensive management

a When/where?

In LMICs there is consensus on immediate hospital treatment of severe arterial hypertension (systolic blood pressure (SBP) > 160 and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) > 110). In Indonesia, consider antihypertensive medication for outpatient treatment if blood pressure consistently exceeds 140/90 mmHg.

b First-line treatment

In severe hypertension, there is a consensus that LMICs support immediate stabilization with recommended agents, including intravenous hydralazine, labetalol, and oral nifedipine, particularly in scenarios where venous access poses a challenge. An analysis of 91 EMLs from 144 LMICs (Cross-sectional study) revealed a wide range of antihypertensive therapies, whose selection factors include physician familiarity, availability, adverse effects, and teratogenic potential. In general terms (Prospective study), during the antepartum period, nifedipine and Alpha-methyldopa are often chosen to maintain arterial pressure; transitioning to amlodipine or an ACE inhibitor is recommended in the postpartum period.

South African guidelines (Qualitative narrative review, Feasibility study and Cross-sectional study) recommend using 10 mg of rapid-acting oral nifedipine or intravenous labetalol, followed by a maintenance regimen of 1 g of oral alpha-methyldopa. Nitroglycerin is preferred for hypertension complicated by pulmonary edema. The recommended treatment for mild preeclampsia involves the administration of alpha-methyldopa at a dosage of 500 mg three times a day. In Latin America and the Philippines (Cross-sectional study and Feasibility study), administering bolus doses of oral hydralazine, labetalol, or nifedipine is the primary therapeutic approach.

In the Philippines (Qualitative Narrative review), intravenous nicardipine is additionally recommended as a first-line management option. In women presenting with well-controlled non-severe hypertension or chronic hypertension, these guidelines suggest antihypertensive use to maintain BP within specified ranges (SBP 130–155 mmHg and DBP 80–105 mmHg), with methyldopa, calcium antagonists, or beta-blockers. In Nigeria (Feasibility study), community health workers often use amiloride, hydrochlorothiazide, or nifedipine as preliminary interventions before referring patients to health centers for complete treatment. Methyldopa and hydralazine are frequently adopted by nurses and physicians. In Pakistan (Mixed method study), these teams also use methyldopa (250 mg) before referral.

### Prognosis in pulmonary embolism [^117XGgYJ]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Acute pulmonary embolism has a wide prognostic spectrum, ranging from sudden death within minutes of a thromboembolic episode to a benign treatable condition associated with a stable clinical course and no long-term sequelae. In patients who survive an initial thromboembolic episode and receive antithrombotic therapy, the clinical course can be complicated by recurrent nonfatal venous thromboembolism, fatal pulmonary embolism, the postthrombotic syndrome, and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension. Identifying which patients are at increased risk of experiencing these sequelae is important in decision making relating to the aggressiveness of initial antithrombotic therapy, the duration of antithrombotic therapy, and the frequency of clinical surveillance. In addition, this information may be helpful to clinicians in discussing disease prognosis with patients. The objectives of this review are to provide reasonable estimates of the risks of recurrent nonfatal venous thromboembolism, fatal pulmonary embolism, the postthrombotic syndrome, and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension in patients with treated pulmonary embolism, and to identify risk factors for these sequelae.

### Acute psychosis as a complication of hydralazine therapy in essential hypertension… [^113udnB1]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Considerable publicity has recently been given to the newer hypotensive agents. The most promising of these drugs, hexamethonium, a ganglionic blocking agent, and hydralazine hydrochloride, a sympathetic blocking agent with other complex actions, are now being used extensively in treatment of patients with essential hypertension. 1 A third compound, Dibenzyline hydrochloride is an orally effective, sympathetic blocking agent that produces a fall in blood pressure when the patient is in an upright position, and is capable of preventing wide fluctuations in pressure as well as relieving symptoms. 2 All of these drugs may produce severe reactions if they are not used under controlled conditions. Grimson and his associates3 and Schroeder4 have recently published reports advising caution in the use of these drugs.

We have encountered numerous side-reactions of these three drugs, used either alone or in combination, in a group of carefully selected patients being treated Moser M, Syner J, Malitz S, Mattingly TW.

ISHLT members have recognized the importance of a consensus statement on the evaluation and management of patients with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension. The creation of this document required multiple steps, including the engagement of the ISHLT councils, approval by the Standards and Guidelines Committee, identification and selection of experts in the field, and the development of 6 working groups. Each working group provided a separate section based on an extensive literature search. These sections were then coalesced into a single document that was circulated to all members of the working groups. Key points were summarized at the end of each section. Due to the limited number of comparative trials in this field, the document was written as a literature review with expert opinion rather than based on level of evidence.

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 203: chronic hypertension in pregnancy [^117HgGvN]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). High credibility.

Hydralazine — use, onset, adverse effects, and hypotensive overshoot in pregnancy — has longstanding experience and specific risk considerations. Hydralazine has been used extensively for severe hypertension in pregnancy for more than 65 years, with an onset of action that is relatively slow for an IV drug (10–20 minutes). Common limiting adverse effects, experienced by up to 50% of recipients, include reflex tachycardia, hypotension, headaches, palpitations, flushing, anxiety, tremors, vomiting, epigastric pain, and fluid retention by activation of the renin–angiotensin system. Hypotensive overshoot associated with hydralazine may affect uteroplacental or maternal renal blood flow and lead to oliguria, particularly in volume-depleted pregnant women; late decelerations often respond to fluid loading and position changes, although cases with placental abruption or fetal distress requiring emergency cesarean delivery have been reported. Prior correction of hypovolemia may be helpful to prevent hypotensive overshoot, which is an unpredictable complication not always dose related; because hydralazine has a long duration of action, it can last up to 12 hours, and fetal distress secondary to maternal hypotension seems to be more frequent with continuous infusion than with repeat bolus administrations.

### Current and future management of chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension: from diagnosis to treatment responses [^115CYGoP]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2006). Low credibility.

Although pulmonary endarterectomy (PEA) has been proven a very effective treatment for chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension, it cannot be performed in a substantial proportion of patients. Here, we outline a proposed treatment algorithm, outlining therapeutic alternatives: (1) PEA should be considered as the first treatment option, where possible; (2) medical intervention is a possible option in inoperable patients and those with significant arteriopathy, although only chronic anticoagulation has been widely used to date (advanced medical treatment options could include prostanoids, endothelin receptor antagonists, or phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors, but randomized clinical trials are required); (3) pulmonary hypertension is likely to persist after PEA in patients with significant small-vessel arteriopathy, resulting in poor clinical outcome and increased perioperative mortality (medical therapy could also be applied here); (4) anticoagulation therapy and, possibly, advanced medical treatment with careful monitoring may provide benefits in patients with mild or asymptomatic disease; (5) if medical therapy begins to fail, PEA should be offered without delay to avoid progression to severe, secondary arteriopathy; (6) in the absence of severe comorbidity, lung transplantation may be undertaken where PEA has failed, in nonresponders to medical therapy, and in patients with progressive arteriopathy; (7) in patients not eligible for PEA due to collateral and/or surgically inaccessible lesions, balloon angioplasty may be a possible alternative at some centers, but is experimental and requires further assessment. Continued research and clinical trials investigating possible applications of new medical treatments are required.

Recent advances in pharmacotherapeutics and interventional techniques have resulted in resurgence in interest regarding the optimal means of management of hemodynamically significant pulmonary embolic disease. However, these various techniques have many associated disadvantages, and it is of paramount importance that the responsible physician has a detailed understanding of each of these so that the appropriate intervention be requested and performed. By way of background discussion and relevant cases in point, we consider each of these management options in turn, with particular reference to the advantages, disadvantages, and application of each.

### Therapy for pulmonary arterial hypertension in adults: update of the CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^115GQt7v]. Chest (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) carries a poor prognosis if not promptly diagnosed and appropriately treated. The development and approval of 14 medications over the last several decades have led to a rapidly evolving approach to therapy, and have necessitated periodic updating of evidence-based treatment guidelines. This guideline statement, which now includes a visual algorithm to enhance its clinical utility, represents the fourth iteration of the American College of Chest Physicians Guideline and Expert Panel Report on Pharmacotherapy for PAH.

Methods

The guideline panel conducted an updated systematic review to identify studies published after those included in the 2014 guideline. A systematic literature search was conducted using MEDLINE via PubMed and the Cochrane Library. The quality of the body of evidence was assessed for each critical or important outcome of interest using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach. Graded recommendations and ungraded consensus-based statements were developed and voted on using a modified Delphi technique to achieve consensus.

Results

Two new recommendations on combination therapy and two ungraded consensus-based statements on palliative care were developed. An evidence-based and consensus-driven treatment algorithm was created to guide the clinician through an organized approach to management, and to direct readers to the appropriate area of the document for more detailed information.

Conclusions

Therapeutic options for the patient with PAH continue to expand through basic discovery, translational science, and clinical trials. Optimal use of new treatment options requires prompt evaluation at an expert center, utilization of current evidence-based guidelines, and collaborative care using sound clinical judgment.

### Pharmacologic therapy for pulmonary arterial hypertension in adults: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^113YSu8p]. Chest (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

Choices of pharmacologic therapies for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) are ideally guided by high-level evidence. The objective of this guideline is to provide clinicians advice regarding pharmacologic therapy for adult patients with PAH as informed by available evidence.

Methods

This guideline was based on systematic reviews of English language evidence published between 1990 and November 2013, identified using the MEDLINE and Cochrane Library databases. The strength of available evidence was graded using the Grades of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation methodology. Guideline recommendations, or consensus statements when available evidence was insufficient to support recommendations, were developed using a modified Delphi technique to achieve consensus.

Results

Available evidence is limited in its ability to support high-level recommendations. Therefore, we drafted consensus statements to address many clinical questions regarding pharmacotherapy for patients with PAH. A total of 79 recommendations or consensus statements were adopted and graded.

Conclusions

Clinical decisions regarding pharmacotherapy for PAH should be guided by high-level recommendations when sufficient evidence is available. Absent higher level evidence, consensus statements based upon available information must be used. Further studies are needed to address the gaps in available knowledge regarding optimal pharmacotherapy for PAH.

Pharmacologic therapy for pulmonary arterial hypertension in adults — We suggest that the severity of a pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) patient's disease be evaluated in a systematic and consistent manner, using a combination of World Health Organization (WHO) functional class (FC), exercise capacity, echocardiographic, laboratory and hemodynamic variables in order to inform therapeutic decisions (Grade CB). We suggest that, whenever possible, all PAH patients be evaluated promptly at a center with expertise in the diagnosis of PAH, ideally prior to the initiation of therapy (Grade CB). We suggest collaborative and closely coordinated care of PAH patients involving the expertise of both local physicians and those with expertise in PAH care (Grade CB). Remark: Appropriate care may require the coordinated efforts of cardiologists, pulmonologists, rheumatologists, primary care, or other specialties.

### Anticoagulation therapy versus placebo for pulmonary hypertension [^116rzcDi]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Elevation of pulmonary pressure is no longer a rare disease, given its multifactorial etiology. However data on the actual incidence of this condition are still limited, and controversies regarding its management are ongoing. Use of anticoagulation in the management of pulmonary hypertension is based on the presence of in situ thrombosis in the patient with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and on retrospective evidence of clinical benefit. Current practice is dependent mostly on expert opinion and individualised experience. The real benefit of its use in different types of pulmonary hypertension is still debatable, and the therapeutic target of the international normalised ratio (INR) among treated patients remains inconclusive. Adverse outcomes associated with anticoagulants are significant and can include fatal haemorrhage. Justification for the use of this intervention requires critical evaluation of randomised controlled trials.

Objectives

1. To evaluate the effectiveness of, and potential adverse events associated with, anticoagulation in the management of pulmonary hypertension (PH).2. To evaluate the effective therapeutic INR in pulmonary hypertensive patients receiving anticoagulants (North American centres 1.5 to 2.5, European centres 2.0 to 3.0).

Search Methods

We identified trials through searches of the following databases. Cochrane Airways Group Trials Register; Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), part of The Cochrane Library; MEDLINE (Ovid); EMBASE (Ovid); CINAHL (EBSCOhost); Clinical trials.gov and the World Health Organization (WHO) trials portal. The trial search date was 28 March 2014.

Selection Criteria

We planned to include only randomised controlled trials. Participants with PH with co-morbidities including medical conditions requiring long-term anticoagulation were to be included. We also planned to include trials comparing any anticoagulant with placebo.

Data Collection and Analysis

Review authors (IE and HE) independently appraised all identified citations to establish their relevance for inclusion in the review. IE and HE independently screened the titles and abstracts of all identified potential studies for inclusion.

Main Results

No eligible trials were identified for inclusion in this review.

Authors' Conclusions

No eligible studies were identified for inclusion in this review. Although our review of available non-randomised studies shows beneficial effect, this finding should be interpreted with caution since there are likely to be biases associated with their design and our methods were not designed to identify, appraise and summarise evidence from them. So that better decisions can be made regarding the effectiveness of this intervention, well-designed randomised controlled trials are needed.
