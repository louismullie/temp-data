## Question

treatment for low free testosterone with normal testosterone

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about treatment options for low free testosterone with normal total testosterone. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the biochemical abnormality with proper timing and assays. Then, I should verify how free testosterone was measured and whether SHBG and albumin were used to calculate it. Next, I will evaluate conditions that alter SHBG and could explain low free testosterone with normal total testosterone. After that, I must correlate labs with specific symptoms and exclude mimics. Then, I need to assess gonadotropins to distinguish primary from secondary processes and decide whether any pituitary work-up is warranted. Finally, I will consider first-line lifestyle optimization, criteria for a time-limited TRT trial if indicated, contraindications and monitoring, and when to discontinue therapy.

> Let me first confirm the biochemical signal before labeling hypogonadism; I should repeat total testosterone on two separate early-morning fasting occasions with a reliable, standardized assay because diurnal and day-to-day variability is substantial and up to 30% of older men with an initial low value normalize on repeat testing, and I should avoid testing during acute illness to prevent spurious suppression of testosterone [^111zq8AY] [^115LrmTB] [^112MVWjG].

> Wait, I need to verify how free testosterone was obtained; I should measure SHBG and albumin and then either calculate free testosterone with a validated equation or measure it by equilibrium dialysis, and I must not use direct analog free T immunoassays because they are inaccurate, especially when TT is near the lower limit of normal or when SHBG is abnormal [^116yTpN9] [^116kpqgV].

> Hold on, I should double-check the interpretive thresholds; total testosterone above roughly 350–400 ng/dL makes low free testosterone unlikely in most men, whereas values in the 200–350 ng/dL range are where free testosterone assessment adds the most diagnostic value, so if TT is clearly high-normal I need to re-examine the assay or SHBG issue before concluding low free testosterone is real [^116p18DP] [^1138udww].

> I will now examine SHBG physiology; high SHBG states such as aging, hyperthyroidism, chronic liver disease, HIV, certain anticonvulsants, and exogenous estrogens can raise total testosterone while decreasing free testosterone, which fits low FT with normal TT, whereas low SHBG states like obesity and type 2 diabetes typically yield low TT with normal FT, the so-called pseudohypogonadism, so the direction of SHBG change matters here [^116yTpN9] [^115qUems] [^112YHvvM].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially almost attributed low free testosterone with normal total testosterone to obesity alone; I should correct that because obesity usually lowers SHBG and total testosterone but preserves free testosterone, making it a different biochemical pattern than this case scenario, which more often reflects elevated SHBG or true androgen deficiency unmasked by high SHBG [^112YHvvM] [^115qUems].

> Next, I should review symptoms carefully; low libido, erectile dysfunction, and reduced morning erections are the most specific correlates of androgen deficiency, whereas fatigue, low mood, poor concentration, and low vitality are nonspecific and often reflect depression, sleep apnea, thyroid disease, medication effects, or cardiometabolic illness, so I need to screen for these mimics before anchoring on testosterone deficiency [^114XKuPY] [^111EbdnM] [^116QUpQv].

> I need to ensure I classify the axis correctly; measuring LH and FSH helps pivot the evaluation, with high or high-normal gonadotropins suggesting primary testicular failure and low-normal gonadotropins pointing to functional or secondary hypogonadism, and unless red flags exist, extensive pituitary imaging has low yield in older men with normal gonadotropins and suspected functional suppression [^11738iP2] [^112YHvvM] [^111EbdnM].

> But wait, what if prolactin or thyroid indices are abnormal; in that case I should confirm and treat those first and consider sellar imaging if hyperprolactinemia persists or other pituitary signs emerge, keeping in mind that medications and systemic illness commonly suppress the axis without structural disease in men over 50 [^111EbdnM] [^1132LYjC].

> Before reaching for testosterone, I should prioritize first-line management targeting reversible drivers for 6–12 months, including weight loss, increased physical activity, optimization of sleep apnea, diabetes, and other comorbid conditions, because these steps can increase testosterone by 10–30% and often normalize androgen status without exposing patients to TRT risks, while addressing ED with PDE5 inhibitors or other symptom-specific therapies when appropriate [^1176zTxe] [^113BAEvt] [^114W9Cp4].

> I should double-check response after optimization; if specific sexual symptoms persist and free testosterone remains unequivocally low on accurate assessment in the setting of normal or high SHBG and no contraindications, a time-limited 3–6 month shared decision-making trial of TRT can be considered, with counseling that benefits on sexual function are modest on average and long-term cardiovascular and prostate outcomes remain uncertain [^114TwRZc] [^113esc8W] [^115dU9ax].

> Let me consider contraindications and monitoring before any trial; I should avoid TRT in men with active or high-risk prostate or breast cancer, severe LUTS without evaluation, elevated PSA without urologic assessment, hematocrit above 54%, recent MI or stroke, uncontrolled heart failure, untreated severe OSA, or thrombophilia, and if started, I should monitor symptoms, serum testosterone, hematocrit, and PSA at baseline and periodically thereafter [^112uJAkp] [^114N7HCt] [^117KbkG9].

> Hold on, I should verify the stop rule; if there is no meaningful improvement in sexual function by 3–6 months, TRT should be discontinued, and even if there is benefit, I need to continue periodic reassessment and de-escalate if risks outweigh benefits or goals are not being met [^114TwRZc] [^117Ubn9i] [^115dU9ax].

> Let me summarize to ensure coherence; the key steps are to confirm low free testosterone accurately with repeat morning fasting measurements and proper methods, identify and treat SHBG-altering and systemic conditions first, correlate with specific sexual symptoms, use LH/FSH to exclude primary testicular failure or pituitary red flags, favor lifestyle and comorbidity optimization as first-line, and reserve a closely monitored, time-limited TRT trial for persistent symptomatic men with unequivocally low free testosterone and no contraindications, recognizing that many such cases reflect functional suppression rather than classic hypogonadism [^116QUpQv] [^1132LYjC] [^116yTpN9] [^1176zTxe].

---

For men with low free testosterone but normal total testosterone, **treat only if symptomatic** [^116QUpQv] and **confirm low free T using reliable methods** [^116yTpN9]. Start with **lifestyle changes** (weight loss, exercise, treat sleep apnea, stop smoking, limit alcohol) [^113BAEvt] and address **reversible causes** (medications, comorbidities) [^114W9Cp4]. If symptoms persist after 6–12 months, **consider testosterone therapy** [^114W9Cp4] with shared decision-making; monitor benefits and adverse effects, and discontinue if there is no improvement [^114TwRZc]. Avoid **TRT** in men planning fertility or with contraindications (prostate/breast cancer, severe LUTS, recent cardiovascular events, thrombophilia, untreated severe sleep apnea) [^112uJAkp] [^1174Hvb4].

---

## Diagnostic criteria and clinical significance

Diagnosis of hypogonadism requires **consistent symptoms/signs and unequivocally low total and/or free testosterone** [^116QUpQv]. Clinical significance: low free testosterone with normal total testosterone can cause **androgen deficiency symptoms** (sexual dysfunction, fatigue, reduced muscle mass, osteoporosis) [^114XFAuG].

---

## Recommended diagnostic approach

- **Initial testing**: Measure total testosterone on two separate fasting morning samples (7–10 am) [^111zq8AY] [^113ss2Ag].

- **Free testosterone assessment**: Use equilibrium dialysis or calculate from total testosterone, SHBG, and albumin when total testosterone is borderline or SHBG is abnormal [^116yTpN9] [^116kpqgV].

- **Avoid direct immunoassays**: Do not use direct analog-based free testosterone immunoassays [^116yTpN9] [^1138udww].

---

## Clinical guidelines for treatment

- **Lifestyle modifications**: First-line therapy includes weight loss, exercise, treating sleep apnea, smoking cessation, and alcohol reduction [^113BAEvt] [^114W9Cp4].

- **Address reversible causes**: Optimize comorbidities and review medications that suppress the HPT axis [^114W9Cp4].

- **Testosterone therapy**: Consider only for persistent symptoms after 6–12 months of lifestyle measures and confirmed low free testosterone [^114W9Cp4] [^117Ubn9i].

---

## Indications for testosterone therapy

Testosterone therapy is appropriate when **androgen-deficiency symptoms** — such as sexual dysfunction, fatigue, reduced muscle mass, or osteoporosis — persist despite lifestyle measures [^115x7nqZ] [^114W9Cp4]. Initiate therapy only after low free testosterone is confirmed with reliable methods [^116yTpN9]. Use shared decision-making to discuss benefits, risks, and patient preferences before starting therapy [^117Ubn9i].

---

## Contraindications to testosterone therapy

Absolute contraindications include **prostate or breast cancer, severe LUTS, recent MI or stroke, thrombophilia, and untreated severe sleep apnea** [^112uJAkp]. Relative contraindications include **elevated hematocrit, high PSA, uncontrolled heart failure, and fertility plans** [^112uJAkp] [^1174Hvb4].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

- **Clinical monitoring**: Reassess symptoms within 12 months and periodically thereafter [^114TwRZc].

- **Laboratory monitoring**: Check testosterone, hematocrit, and PSA at baseline and at least annually [^117KbkG9].

- **Discontinue therapy**: Stop if no symptom improvement or adverse effects occur [^114TwRZc].

---

## Alternative treatments

**Clomiphene citrate** can be considered for men who desire fertility or have contraindications to testosterone therapy, and **selective androgen receptor modulators (SARMs)** are investigational options under study.

---

## Risks and benefits of testosterone therapy

Benefits include **improved sexual function, mood, muscle mass, and bone density** [^114XcycD], and risks include **erythrocytosis, prostate effects, cardiovascular events, and infertility**.

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Recommendation** | **Evidence level** |
|-|-|
| Lifestyle modifications | High |
| Address reversible causes | High |
| Testosterone therapy for persistent symptoms | Moderate |
| Shared decision-making | High |
| Regular monitoring and follow-up | High |
| Discontinue if no improvement | High |

---

Treatment for low free testosterone with normal total testosterone should be guided by **symptoms** and **confirmation of low free testosterone**. Start with lifestyle changes and address reversible causes; consider testosterone therapy only if symptoms persist, with careful monitoring and shared decision-making [^114W9Cp4] [^114TwRZc].

### Approach to the patient: The evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years with low serum testosterone concentration [^114W9Cp4]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). High credibility.

The decision to treat medical conditions always involves an analysis of the benefits and risks; that analysis is particularly important when deciding to initiate testosterone therapy in men aged 50 years and older. Although testosterone replacement for men with organic hypogonadism is uncontroversial irrespective of age, men aged 50 years and older with nonspecific symptoms, reproducibly low serum testosterone concentrations, normal serum gonadotropins, and no evidence of hypothalamic-pituitary disease often experience improved health and well-being, as well as normalization of serum testosterone concentrations with the optimization of weight and comorbidities and by stopping or reducing the dosage of medications that affect the HPT axis.

- **Alternative therapies**: Consider therapies other than testosterone for symptoms and signs attributed to hypogonadism. These include:
	- PDE5-inhibitors for erectile dysfunction
	- Treatment of sleep apnea, depression, obesity, and diabetes mellitus with proven effective therapies
	- Medications that reduce fracture risk for osteoporosis

It is reasonable to add testosterone treatment for men aged 50 years and older with persistent symptoms of hypogonadism and reproducibly low serum testosterone (measured fasted in the morning when the man is at baseline health) and normal serum gonadotropin concentrations. This should be considered despite lifestyle measures for 6–12 months aimed at losing weight (if BMI > 25 kg/m²) and optimizing the management of comorbidities. This decision must be individualized, not algorithmic, and there should be no contraindication.

### Testosterone therapy in men with hypogonadism: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^116yTpN9]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for male hypogonadism, more specifically with respect to testosterone levels, the ES 2018 guidelines recommend determining free testosterone concentrations either directly from equilibrium dialysis assays or by calculations using total testosterone, sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), and albumin concentrations. This is particularly important in patients with conditions altering SHBG, such as obesity, diabetes mellitus, corticosteroids, nephrotic syndrome, hypothyroidism, acromegaly, SHBG gene polymorphisms, older age, HIV, cirrhosis, hepatitis, hyperthyroidism, certain anticonvulsants, or estrogens. Additionally, patients with initial total testosterone concentrations at or near the lower limit of the normal range (200–400 ng/dL) should have their free testosterone determined this way. Direct analog-based free testosterone immunoassays should not be used.

### Performance of total testosterone measurement to predict free testosterone for the biochemical evaluation of male hypogonadism [^116p18DP]. The Journal of Urology (2012). Low credibility.

Guidelines recommend serum total testosterone measurement as the initial test to evaluate male hypogonadism, reserving free testosterone assessment for men with suspected sex hormone-binding globulin abnormalities or total testosterone near the lower limit of normal. We determined the performance of total testosterone measurement as a test to identify men with normal vs low free testosterone.

- **Materials and methods**: We examined the electronic medical records of all 3,672 men evaluated for hypogonadism by a serum testosterone panel, including total testosterone, sex hormone-binding globulin, albumin, and calculated free testosterone, from January 1, 1997, through December 31, 2007, in a network that serves veterans in Washington.

- **Results**: The sensitivity and specificity of low total testosterone (less than 280 ng/dl) to rule out and predict low calculated free testosterone was 91.0% and 73.7%, respectively. At thresholds of less than 350 and less than 400 ng/dl, the sensitivity of total testosterone for low calculated free testosterone increased to 96.8% and 98.2%; at thresholds of less than 150 and less than 200 ng/dl, specificity increased to 98.9% and 92.6%, respectively.

- **Conclusions**: Total testosterone between 280 and 350 ng/dl is not sensitive enough to reliably exclude hypogonadism. Total testosterone must exceed 350 to 400 ng/dl to reliably predict normal free testosterone. Except when levels are less than 150 ng/dl, total testosterone measurement has low specificity for the biochemical diagnosis of hypogonadism.

### British society for sexual medicine guidelines on adult testosterone deficiency, with statements for UK practice [^116AjNSy]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Testosterone deficiency (TD) is an increasingly common problem with significant health implications, but its diagnosis and management can be challenging.

- **Aim**: To review the available literature on TD and provide evidence-based statements for UK clinical practice.

- **Methods**: Evidence was derived from Medline, EMBASE, and Cochrane searches on hypogonadism, testosterone (T) therapy, and cardiovascular safety from May 2005 to May 2015. Further searches continued until May 2017.

- **Outcomes**: To provide a guideline on diagnosing and managing TD, with levels of evidence and grades of recommendation based on a critical review of the literature and consensus of the British Society of Sexual Medicine panel.

- **Results**: Twenty-five statements are provided, relating to five key areas: screening, diagnosis, initiating T therapy, benefits and risks of T therapy, and follow-up. Seven statements are supported by level 1, eight by level 2, five by level 3, and five by level 4 evidence.

- **Clinical implications**: To help guide UK practitioners on effectively diagnosing and managing primary and age-related TD.

- **Strengths and limitations**: A large amount of literature was carefully sourced and reviewed, presenting the best evidence available at the time. However, some statements are based on poor-quality evidence. This is a rapidly evolving area of research, and recommendations are subject to change. Guidelines can never replace clinical expertise when making treatment decisions for individual patients but rather help to focus decisions while considering personal values, preferences, and individual circumstances.

### Approach to the patient: The evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years with low serum testosterone concentration [^1138udww]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Low credibility.

Accurate assessment of serum free testosterone might be helpful when serum total testosterone concentration approximates the lower limit of normal or when abnormalities in sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) are suspected. A fasting early morning total testosterone concentration of > 350 ng/dL (12 nmol/L), measured by a reliable assay, is generally consistent with a normal serum free testosterone and typically does not require assessment of free testosterone except in men with suspected or proven high SHBG concentrations.

The most common causes of the constellation of low serum total testosterone, low serum SHBG, and normal free serum testosterone (i.e. pseudohypogonadism) are obesity and type 2 diabetes.

There are no well-validated, outcome-based normal reference ranges for serum free testosterone concentration in older men. In addition, there is wide variation in the quality and the various methods used to measure or calculate serum free testosterone concentrations. Direct methods of measurement of free testosterone are inaccurate and should not be used.

### 'What should I do with a 60-year-old man with a slightly low serum total testosterone concentration and normal levels of serum gonadotrophins' [^112kDkJD]. Clinical Endocrinology (2010). Low credibility.

The fundamental question in assessing an older man with a slightly low total testosterone and normal gonadotrophin levels is to determine whether he has clinical hypogonadism. Hypogonadism is defined as a clinical syndrome complex comprising both symptoms and biochemical testosterone deficiency. As symptoms are nonspecific, and there are no clear cut-off values for testosterone levels, this invariably leads to a clinical dilemma.

International guidelines have been published to provide recommendations to aid clinicians in making a diagnosis. Late-onset hypogonadism, the preferred terminology for age-related hypogonadism, can only be diagnosed once other causes have been excluded. Evidence shows that low testosterone levels are associated with several common male conditions, including erectile dysfunction, osteoporosis, and diabetes.

Short-term studies have shown benefits of testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) on body composition, bone metabolism, insulin resistance, sexual function, and quality of life. Recommendations give clear advice on safety monitoring, specifically in relation to prostate health. If a diagnosis of hypogonadism is made with borderline testosterone levels, a 3-month trial of TRT can be considered. The diagnosis of hypogonadism associated with borderline testosterone levels and the decision to treat should only be made by an experienced clinician.

### Testosterone treatment in adult men with age-related low testosterone: A clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians [^117Ubn9i]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2020). High credibility.

The American College of Physicians (ACP) developed this guideline to provide clinical recommendations based on the evidence of the benefits and harms of testosterone treatment in adult men with age-related low testosterone. This guideline is endorsed by the American Academy of Family Physicians.

- **Methods**: The ACP Clinical Guidelines Committee based these recommendations on a systematic review of the efficacy and safety of testosterone treatment in adult men with age-related low testosterone. Clinical outcomes were evaluated using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) system and included sexual function, physical function, quality of life, energy and vitality, depression, cognition, serious adverse events, major adverse cardiovascular events, and other adverse events.

- **Target audience and patient population**: The target audience includes all clinicians, and the target patient population includes adult men with age-related low testosterone.

- **Recommendation 1a**: ACP suggests that clinicians discuss whether to initiate testosterone treatment in men with age-related low testosterone and sexual dysfunction who want to improve sexual function (conditional recommendation; low-certainty evidence). The discussion should include the potential benefits, harms, costs, and patient preferences.

- **Recommendation 1b**: ACP suggests that clinicians should reevaluate symptoms within 12 months and periodically thereafter. Clinicians should discontinue testosterone treatment in men with age-related low testosterone and sexual dysfunction if appropriate.

### Approach to the patient: The evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years with low serum testosterone concentration [^111EbdnM]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism (2023). High credibility.

- **Figure 1**: Approach to diagnosis and management of possible hypogonadism in men ≥ 50 years.
	1. Recent onset of declining libido and/or erectile function, new onset or tender gynecomastia; osteoporosis (see Table 1).
	2. Patients are often referred for consultation about low serum total testosterone (TT) that was measured in the absence of high clinical suspicion of hypogonadism. It is generally useful to repeat the measurement in this clinical setting.
	3. Measure TT when patient is at baseline health. Confirm low TT with a second fasting sample. At a minimum, the confirmatory measurement should be done on a fasting sample drawn between 7 and 10 AM.
	4. Assess serum free testosterone (FT) on confirmatory sample using an accurate method if the serum TT is 220–264 ng/dL (7.6–9.2 nmol/L) or if abnormalities in serum SHBG are suspected (see Table 2). Although some experts discourage the measurement of free testosterone given the limitations discussed in the manuscript and focus instead on interpretation of SHBG along with total testosterone, this approach is congruent with assessing serum free testosterone with an accurate method.
	5. Investigation for cause of hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular (HPT) disorder includes clinical assessment for Cushing syndrome, review of medications that affect the HPT axis, and measurement of serum prolactin. Measurement of serum T4 might be useful if panhypopituitarism is suspected. Sellar imaging is indicated if serum prolactin is elevated. Evaluation of hyperprolactinemia also includes review of medications and measurement of TSH. Sellar imaging also in indicated cases.

### Testosterone treatment in adult men with age-related low testosterone: A clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians [^111UcpoR]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for male hypogonadism, specifically concerning testosterone therapy, the 2020 ACP guidelines recommend avoiding the initiation of testosterone therapy in patients with age-related low testosterone to improve energy, vitality, physical function, or cognition.

---

### Testosterone therapy in men with hypogonadism: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^11618rAB]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management for male hypogonadism, specifically with respect to testosterone therapy, the Endocrine Society (ES) 2018 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of testosterone replacement therapy in patients aged 55–69 years with hypogonadism who have a life expectancy of more than 10 years. This decision should only be made after discussing the potential benefits and risks, evaluating prostate cancer risk, and engaging the patient in shared decision-making regarding prostate cancer monitoring. It is advised to assess prostate cancer risk before, and 3–12 months after, initiating testosterone therapy for patients who choose monitoring.

### Efficacy and safety of testosterone treatment in men: An evidence report for a clinical practice guideline by the American College of Physicians [^113esc8W]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2020). High credibility.

The rates of testosterone treatment in adult men have increased in the United States over the past two decades.

- **Purpose**: To assess the benefits and harms of testosterone treatment for men without underlying organic causes of hypogonadism.

- **Data sources**: English-language searches of multiple electronic databases from January 1980 to May 2019 and reference lists from systematic reviews.

- **Study selection**: Includes 38 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of at least six months' duration that evaluated transdermal or intramuscular testosterone therapies versus placebo or no treatment and reported prespecified patient-centered outcomes, as well as 20 long-term observational studies, U.S. Food and Drug Administration review data, and product labels that reported harms information.

- **Data extraction**: Conducted by a single investigator and confirmed by a second; two investigators assessed the risk of bias, and evidence certainty was determined by consensus.

- **Data synthesis**: Studies enrolled mostly older men who varied in age, symptoms, and testosterone eligibility criteria. Testosterone therapy improved sexual functioning and quality of life in men with low testosterone levels, although effect sizes were small (low- to moderate-certainty evidence). Testosterone therapy had little to no effect on physical functioning, depressive symptoms, energy and vitality, or cognition. Harms evidence reported in trials was judged to be insufficient or of low certainty for most harm outcomes. No trials were powered to assess cardiovascular events or prostate cancer, and trials often excluded men at increased risk.

### The effects of testosterone on bone health in males with testosterone deficiency: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117EFQqv]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2020). Low credibility.

Testosterone deficiency (TD) may induce a series of clinical symptoms. Studies have shown that testosterone supplementation may prevent these unfavorable symptoms and improve patients' quality of life. Given the conflicting findings across studies, this systematic review aims to evaluate the effects and risks associated with testosterone supplementation in middle-aged or aging males with TD.

- **Methods**: Electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed, and Cochrane Library) were searched up to December 2019. The risk of bias of individual included studies and the quality of the aggregate evidence were assessed using the GRADE approach. Our primary outcome was bone mineral density (BMD). Meta-analyses were performed. This systematic review was reported according to the PRISMA statement.

- **Results**: A total of 52 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included. When compared with placebo, testosterone supplementation did not increase total BMD (short-term: 1081 participants, MD -0.01 g/cm², 95% CI -0.02 g/cm² to 0.01 g/cm²; long-term: 156 participants, MD 0.04 g/cm², 95% CI -0.07 g/cm² to 0.14 g/cm²) at the lumbar spine, hip, or femur neck. Furthermore, testosterone supplementation did not decrease the risk of falling or fracture. Lastly, it was found that testosterone supplementation did not increase the risk of cardiovascular events (1374 participants, RR 1.28, 95% CI 0.62 to 2.64), all-cause mortality (729 participants, RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.29 to 1.04), or prostatic events. However, testosterone supplementation may improve sexual function and quality of life (1328 participants).

### Approach to the patient: The evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years with low serum testosterone concentration [^1176zTxe]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). High credibility.

In this article, we use a case-based approach to outline the assessment and management of men older than 50 years presenting with features of androgen deficiency and a low testosterone level, based on a review of the literature (PubMed), using the search terms "male hypogonadism", "testosterone deficiency", "androgen deficiency", "functional hypogonadism", "late onset hypogonadism", as well as the clinical experience of the authors. We focus on the diagnosis and management of possible androgen deficiency (Fig. 1). Fertility will not be discussed.

Many of the principles and recommendations that we discuss are pertinent to men under age 50. However, we focus on men ≥ 50 years old in this manuscript because of the following:

1. The prevalence of low serum testosterone concentrations without identifiable HPT pathology increases significantly in men starting at age 40–50.
2. Most of the high-quality epidemiological and randomized controlled studies of men with low serum testosterone concentrations without identifiable HPT pathology were performed in men ≥ 50 years old.
3. The diagnostic evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years old differ from younger individuals because:
	- Evaluation for hypothalamic and pituitary disease with sellar imaging and evaluation for iron overload syndromes is often unnecessary in older men.
	- Infertility due to HPT dysfunction is less commonly important for men ≥ 50 years old.
	- Long-term suppression of the HPT axis (iatrogenic androgen deficiency) is much more likely to occur with exogenous testosterone therapy in men ≥ 50 years old.

### The practical management of testosterone deficiency in men [^114Hq3p8]. Nature Reviews Urology (2015). Low credibility.

Despite increased global interest in testosterone deficiency in men and its treatment with testosterone therapy, the practical aspects of care remain confusing to many practitioners. Testosterone deficiency can result from testicular dysfunction (primary hypogonadism) or hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction (secondary hypogonadism), and it can be congenital or acquired. Sexual and nonsexual symptoms of testosterone deficiency can negatively affect quality of life and cause considerable general health concerns.

Investigation of testosterone deficiency should be undertaken in men with symptoms of reduced libido, erectile dysfunction, depression, fatigue, poor concentration, and poor memory. Total and free testosterone are the most frequently used tests, and evaluating serum concentrations of luteinizing hormone aids in the determination of primary versus secondary testosterone deficiency. Multiple formulations of testosterone therapy are available, but symptomatic benefits might not manifest for several weeks to many months; long-acting formulations are convenient and improve compliance. Concerns regarding cardiovascular and prostate cancer risks are not supported by evidence, and monitoring during therapy is mandatory. On balance, testosterone therapy can be considered a safe and effective treatment for testosterone deficiency.

### Testosterone deficiency: A review and comparison of current guidelines [^112oQ6mF]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

There is much controversy regarding the appropriate evaluation and management of testosterone deficiency (TD).

- **Aim**: To compare guidelines on the evaluation and management of TD to provide clarity for patients and clinicians, as well as to highlight areas of controversy.

- **Methods**: A literature search of MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Library, and various association websites was performed to identify guidelines for TD.

- **Outcomes**: Key aspects in the approach were compared, with a focus on the biochemical definition (cutoff) for low testosterone (T), principles of management, and recommendations for testosterone therapy (TTh) in special patient populations.

- **Results**: Guidelines from the Canadian Medical Association Journal, American Urological Association, European Association of Urology, Endocrine Society, International Society for Sexual Medicine, and British Society for Sexual Medicine were included for review. Recommendations were generally consistent across guidelines. Key differences include the biochemical cutoff for low T and recommendations for patients with low to normal T, prostate cancer, or cardiovascular disease. We highlight several case scenarios in which management differs depending on the guideline adopted.

- **Clinical implications**: Although general diagnostic and management principles are in agreement across the guidelines, notable differences may impact patient diagnosis and eligibility for TTh.

- **Strengths and limitations**: Only guidelines written in English were included. The quality of the included guidelines was not evaluated.

- **Methods**: Electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed, and Cochrane Library) were searched up to December 2019. The risk of bias of individual included studies and the quality of the aggregate evidence were assessed using the GRADE approach. Our primary outcome was bone mineral density (BMD). Meta-analyses were performed. This systematic review was reported according to the PRISMA statement.

- **Results**: A total of 52 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included. When compared with placebo, testosterone supplementation did not increase total BMD [short-term: 1081 participants, MD −0.01 g/cm², 95% CI −0.02 g/cm² to 0.01 g/cm²; long-term: 156 participants, MD 0.04 g/cm², 95% CI −0.07 g/cm² to 0.14 g/cm²], lumbar spine, hip, or femur neck BMD. Furthermore, testosterone supplementation did not decrease the risk of falling or fracture. Lastly, it was found that testosterone supplementation did not increase the risk of cardiovascular events [1374 participants, RR 1.28, 95% CI 0.62 to 2.64], all-cause mortality [729 participants, RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.29 to 1.04], or prostatic events. However, testosterone supplementation may improve sexual function and quality of life.

### Clinical practice patterns in the assessment and management of low testosterone in men: An international survey of endocrinologists [^113J5ADX]. Clinical Endocrinology (2015). Low credibility.

The objective was to document practices in the approach to low testosterone in older men. Given that recommendations are based on low-level evidence, it was hypothesized that there would be wide variability in clinical practice patterns.

Members of all major endocrine as well as andrological societies were invited to participate in a web-based survey of the diagnostic work-up and management of a hypothetical index case of a 61-year-old overweight man presenting with symptoms suggestive of androgen deficiency, without evidence of hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPT) axis disease.

Nine hundred and forty-three respondents (91.2% adult endocrinologists) from Northern America (63.7%), Europe (12.7%), Oceania (8.2%), Latin America and the Caribbean (7.6%), and the Middle East, Asia, or Africa (7.8%) completed the survey. Response rates among participating societies ranged from 4.1–20.0%. There was a wide variability in clinical practice patterns, especially regarding biochemical diagnosis of androgen deficiency, exclusion of HPT axis pathology, and monitoring for prostate cancer. In a man with suggestive symptoms, 42.4% of participants would offer testosterone treatment below a serum total testosterone of 10.4 nmol/l (300 ng/dl). A total of 46.0% of participants were, over the last five years, 'less inclined' to prescribe testosterone to men with nonspecific symptoms and borderline testosterone levels, compared to 'no change' (29.3%) or 'more inclined' (24.7%), P < 0.001.

In conclusion, this large-scale international survey shows wide variability in the management of low testosterone.

### Controversies and advances with testosterone therapy: A 40-year perspective [^111bfNdh]. Urology (2016). Low credibility.

Testosterone therapy (TTh) has become highly controversial. There are important health consequences of testosterone deficiency and meaningful benefits with treatment. There is level 1 evidence that TTh improves sexual function and desire, body composition, and bone density. Concerns regarding cardiovascular risk were based on two deeply flawed retrospective studies and are contradicted by dozens of studies showing cardiovascular benefits of TTh or higher endogenous testosterone, including placebo-controlled studies in men with known heart disease (angina, heart failure). Prostate cancer should no longer be considered a risk of TTh. Testosterone is neither scourge nor panacea — it is just good medicine.

### Testosterone therapy in adult men with androgen deficiency syndromes: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^113EYWFv]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2006). Low credibility.

The objective was to provide guidelines for the evaluation and treatment of androgen deficiency syndromes in adult men.

- **Participants**: The Task Force was composed of a chair, selected by the Clinical Guidelines Subcommittee of The Endocrine Society, five additional experts, a methodologist, and a professional writer. The Task Force received no corporate funding or remuneration.

- **Evidence**: The Task Force used systematic reviews of available evidence to inform its key recommendations. It used consistent language and graphical descriptions of both the strength of recommendation and the quality of evidence, following the recommendations of the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation group.

- **Consensus process**: Consensus was guided by systematic reviews of evidence and discussions during three group meetings, several conference calls, and e-mail communications. Drafts prepared by the panelists with the help of a professional writer were reviewed successively by The Endocrine Society's Clinical Guidelines Subcommittee, Clinical Affairs Committee, and Council. The version approved by the Council was placed on The Endocrine Society's website for comments by members. At each stage of review, the Task Force received written comments and incorporated needed changes.

- **Conclusions**: We recommend diagnosing androgen deficiency only in men with consistent symptoms and signs and unequivocally low serum testosterone levels. We suggest measuring the morning total testosterone level by a reliable assay as the initial diagnostic step.

### Should testosterone replacement be offered to hypogonadal men treated previously for prostatic carcinoma [^113JDBKr]. Clinical Endocrinology (2012). Low credibility.

Androgen administration can cause prostate cancer progression, as well as androgen deprivation therapy is a commonly used therapeutic modality in the treatment of prostate cancer. This article reviews the risks and benefits of testosterone replacement therapy in this context, examining published data from clinical series. Recommendations are made based on the available evidence in an attempt to answer the posed clinical question.

### Global consensus position statement on the use of testosterone therapy for women [^115TWE1i]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Low credibility.

The international panel concluded that the only evidence-based indication for testosterone therapy for women is for the treatment of hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD), with available data supporting a moderate therapeutic effect. There are insufficient data to support the use of testosterone for the treatment of any other symptom or clinical condition or for disease prevention.

Meta-analyses of the available data show no severe adverse events during physiological testosterone use, with the caveat that women at high cardiometabolic risk were excluded from study populations. The safety of long-term testosterone therapy has not been established.

It is of utmost importance that the diagnosis of HSDD involves a full clinical assessment and that other factors contributing to female sexual dysfunction (FSD) must be identified and addressed before testosterone therapy is initiated. A blood total testosterone level should not be used to diagnose HSDD. Treatment should only be with formulations that achieve blood concentrations of testosterone approximating premenopausal physiological concentrations. Because no female product is presently approved by a national regulatory body, male formulations can be judiciously used in female doses, and blood testosterone concentrations must be monitored regularly. The panel recommended against the use of compounded testosterone.

The panel highlighted the pressing need for more research into testosterone therapy for women and the development and licensing of products indicated specifically for women.

### Testosterone therapy in men with androgen deficiency syndromes: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^114N7HCt]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism (2010). High credibility.

The objective of this guideline update was to revise the previous 2006 guidelines for evaluating and treating androgen deficiency syndromes in adult men.

- **Participants**: The Task Force consisted of a chair, appointed by the Clinical Guidelines Subcommittee of The Endocrine Society, five additional experts, a methodologist, and a medical writer. The Task Force did not receive any corporate funding or remuneration.

- **Conclusions**: A diagnosis of androgen deficiency should only be made in men with consistent symptoms and signs and unequivocally low serum testosterone levels. It is suggested that the initial diagnostic test be the measurement of morning total testosterone level using a reliable assay. Confirmation of the diagnosis should involve repeating the measurement of morning total testosterone. In cases where total testosterone is near the lower limit of normal, or an SHBG abnormality is suspected, measurement of free or bioavailable testosterone level using validated assays is recommended. Testosterone therapy is recommended for men with symptomatic androgen deficiency to induce and maintain secondary sex characteristics, improve sexual function, sense of well-being, muscle mass and strength, and bone mineral density. However, it is advised against starting testosterone therapy in patients with breast or prostate cancer, a palpable prostate nodule or induration, or a prostate-specific antigen greater than 4 ng/ml, or greater than 3 ng/ml in men at high risk for prostate cancer, such as African-Americans or men with first-degree relatives with prostate cancer, without further urological evaluation.

### Approach to the patient: The evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years with low serum testosterone concentration [^1132LYjC]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). High credibility.

Men with low serum testosterone concentrations can be categorized as having classic hypogonadism, sometimes called organic hypogonadism, due to an identifiable pathology or disorder of the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular (HPT, gonadal) axis. Alternatively, they can be characterized as eugonadal with suppression of the gonadal axis due to a systemic disorder or condition. A low serum testosterone level due to suppression of the gonadal axis by a systemic disorder is analogous to the changes in thyroid function seen in euthyroid sick syndrome and is sometimes described as functional hypogonadism.

Similar to euthyroid sick syndrome (or nonthyroidal illness), men with low serum testosterone due to suppression of the HPT axis by systemic disease might have underlying normal HPT function. Because the serum testosterone might normalize if the underlying disorder is treated and health is restored, eugonadal sick syndrome or nongonadal illness might be more accurate terms than functional hypogonadism. These terms have the advantage of identifying the underlying gonadal axis as normal and not conflating functional with reversible; pathologies and disorders associated with classic hypogonadism are also potentially reversible (e.g. hyperprolactinemia, iron overload syndromes).

Classic pathological hypogonadism is relatively uncommon, with an estimated lifetime prevalence of less than 1%. Low serum testosterone due to suppression of the HPT axis is common and increases with age and body mass index (BMI). Some experts use the term late-onset hypogonadism for functional hypogonadism in older men.

### Approach to the patient: The evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years with low serum testosterone concentration [^1136CcxY]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Low credibility.

Although testosterone replacement in men with classic hypogonadism due to an identified pathology of the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis is uncontroversial, the role of testosterone treatment for men with age-related declines in circulating testosterone is unclear. This is due to the lack of large, long-term testosterone therapy trials assessing definitive clinical endpoints. However, men ≥ 50 years of age, particularly those who have a body mass index > 25 kg/m² and multiple comorbidities, commonly present with clinical features of androgen deficiency and low serum testosterone concentrations. Clinicians are faced with the question of whether to initiate testosterone therapy, a difficult dilemma that entails a benefit-risk analysis with limited evidence from clinical trials. Using a case scenario, we present a practical approach to the clinical assessment and management of such men.

### Testosterone therapy in men with hypogonadism: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^11798Y7c]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

- **Objective**: To update the "Testosterone Therapy in Men With Androgen Deficiency Syndromes" guideline published in 2010.

- **Participants**: The participants include an Endocrine Society-appointed task force of 10 medical content experts and a clinical practice guideline methodologist.

- **Evidence**: This evidence-based guideline was developed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach to describe the strength of recommendations and the quality of evidence. The task force commissioned two systematic reviews and used the best available evidence from other published systematic reviews and individual studies.

- **Consensus process**: One group meeting, several conference calls, and email communications facilitated consensus development. Endocrine Society committees and members and the cosponsoring organization were invited to review and comment on preliminary drafts of the guideline.

- **Conclusions**: We recommend making a diagnosis of hypogonadism only in men with symptoms and signs consistent with testosterone (T) deficiency and unequivocally and consistently low serum T concentrations. We recommend measuring fasting morning total T concentrations using an accurate and reliable assay as the initial diagnostic test. We recommend confirming the diagnosis by repeating the measurement of morning fasting total T concentrations. In men whose total T is near the lower limit of normal or who have a condition that alters sex hormone-binding globulin, we recommend obtaining a free T concentration using either equilibrium dialysis or estimating it using an accurate method.

### Andropause or male menopause? Rationale for testosterone replacement therapy in older men with low testosterone levels [^112PNaFU]. Endocrine Practice (2013). Low credibility.

To provide rationale for testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) in older men with low testosterone levels and symptoms consistent with testosterone deficiency, a review of the relevant literature was conducted using PubMed.

Cross-sectional and longitudinal population-based studies indicate that total and free testosterone levels fall with aging and may be accompanied by symptoms consistent with androgen deficiency. Testosterone treatment in younger men with very low testosterone levels and hypothalamic, pituitary, or testicular disease is associated with improvements in symptoms, body composition, bone density, and hematocrit/hemoglobin. Studies evaluating testosterone treatment in older men with low testosterone levels are limited, but they suggest some increase in fat-free mass, decrease in fat mass, and increase in bone density of the lumbar spine and femoral neck.

The Testosterone Trial should provide definitive information regarding the potential benefits of TRT in men aged 65 years and older. If efficacy is confirmed, more information will still be needed regarding the risks of TRT in older men.

### The effects of testosterone on bone health in males with testosterone deficiency: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114h4vz3]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2020). Low credibility.

There is uncertainty among clinicians about whether testosterone supplementation in aging males is protective against risks such as all-cause mortality and prostate cancer. Although several systematic reviews on this topic have been published, they did not fully address these questions. For instance, one review investigated the effect of testosterone replacement on patients' quality of life, but it did not examine its impact on bone mineral density (BMD), cardiovascular disease, and all-cause mortality.

Three reviews evaluated testosterone therapy's efficacy in males with late-onset hypogonadism (LOH), finding that testosterone increased BMD. However, these reviews were either outdated or omitted relevant studies; several RCTs later reported no effect of testosterone on BMD. Given these conflicting results, an updated review on the impact of testosterone supplementation on BMD is necessary.

Additionally, two systematic reviews investigated the risk of cardiovascular events following testosterone therapy, but the findings were inconsistent. One review found that testosterone therapy increases the risk of cardiovascular events in aging males, while another mentioned the controversy around this issue. Given the conflicting and insufficient evidence available, this systematic review aims to evaluate the effect of testosterone supplementation on BMD and its potential risks, including fracture, falling, all-cause mortality, cardiovascular disease, and prostate events.

### Practice patterns in the diagnosis and management of hypogonadism: A survey of Sexual Medicine Society of North America members [^116vyEgc]. Urology (2017). Low credibility.

The objective of this study is to describe practice patterns in the diagnosis and treatment of hypogonadism, as the optimal approaches are controversial. Multiple therapeutic options are currently available for hypogonadal men, and treatment patterns vary considerably. The safety of testosterone therapy (TTh) remains understudied.

A 23-question survey regarding the diagnosis and treatment of hypogonadism was sent to all members of the Sexual Medicine Society of North America. Subgroup analyses compared responses between sexual medicine fellows and non-fellows, as well as between academic and non-academic physicians, using a chi-squared analysis.

A total of 101 responses were included for analysis. The most common cutoff value used to diagnose hypogonadism was 300 ng/dL (55%, range = 200–400 ng/dL), and 31% felt comfortable giving TTh to a symptomatic patient with normal serum testosterone levels. No respondents felt that TTh increased the risk of cardiovascular events. Of those surveyed, 68% would prescribe TTh to a hypogonadal man with severe lower urinary tract symptoms, and 64% would offer TTh to a man with low-risk prostate cancer on active surveillance. Fellowship-trained physicians were more likely to prescribe TTh to a man with hypogonadism but normal serum testosterone (P = 0.038); however, they differed in the types of therapy they would use for men with hypogonadism who wish to preserve or regain fertility.

In conclusion, significant variety exists in the diagnosis and treatment of hypogonadism. The majority of physicians will only prescribe TTh in the setting of subnormal serum testosterone levels.

- **Weight reduction**: In patients with obesity.

- **Glycometabolic control**: Improvement in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and/or metabolic syndrome.

- **Morbidity and mortality improvement**: In several chronic diseases, including HIV infection/acquired immune deficiency syndrome, heart failure, obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic kidney diseases, bowel inflammatory diseases, and prevention of long-term outcomes in patients chronically treated with corticosteroid or opioid therapy, in the absence of symptomatic hypogonadism.

- **Fracture risk reduction**: In patients with high fracture risk.

- **Exercise capacity and physical function improvement**: In frail patients.

- **Anti-aging therapy**: In patients older than 65 years.

- **Depressive symptoms improvement**.

- **Cognitive function improvement**.

### Approach to the patient: The evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years with low serum testosterone concentration [^114XKuPY]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). High credibility.

The first step is to determine the pretest probability of hypogonadism in the patient. There is significant overlap between the nonspecific symptoms of hypogonadism and depression. Due to the patient's report of depressed mood and fatigue, an assessment was conducted using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 screening tool, which screened negative for major depression.

Careful assessment for symptoms and signs more specific to hypogonadism is crucial at the evaluation's outset. In an initial cross-sectional report from the European Male Ageing Study, three sexual symptoms — low libido, erectile dysfunction, and reduced morning erections — were consistently associated with low serum testosterone in a syndromic manner. Notably, diminished libido had the highest odds ratio for a low serum testosterone concentration. However, this epidemiology study cannot determine causality. It is posited that reduced sexual activity might lower serum testosterone, suggesting the possibility of reverse causation for the observed association of sexual symptoms with low testosterone. The prevalence of these sexual symptoms in the European Male Aging Study was reported to be 25% to 35% even in men with normal serum testosterone. Symptoms such as fatigue and low mood, while present, are nonspecific and diagnostically weak. They may be attributed to systemic disease, necessitating further consideration of the constellation of symptoms involving sexual dysfunction and low serum testosterone.

### Testosterone and sexual function [^111SoFgf]. Current Opinion in Urology (2017). Low credibility.

Testosterone therapy has been advocated in the treatment of symptoms that may represent normal aging. This review briefly examines randomized clinical trials on the effects of testosterone therapy on sexual function.

Recent findings indicate that about half of the clinical trials showed no benefit of testosterone therapy on any aspect of sexual function. In studies that did report a benefit in some areas of sexual function, most domains were not improved. Testosterone therapy has particularly been disappointing in the treatment of erectile dysfunction. Potential risks of this therapy include an increase in thromboembolic and other cardiovascular diseases.

The limited and inconsistent benefits of testosterone therapy for sexual function argue against the use of this therapy in aging men, including those with 'low testosterone'.

Male hypogonadism (MH) is a common endocrine disorder; however, uncertainties and variations in its diagnosis and management exist. Several guidelines on testosterone replacement therapy have been driven predominantly by single disciplines. The Society for Endocrinology commissioned this new guideline to provide all care providers with a multidisciplinary approach to treating patients with MH. This guideline has been compiled using expertise from endocrine (medical and nursing), primary care, clinical biochemistry, urology, and reproductive medicine practices. These guidelines also provide a patient perspective to help clinicians best manage MH.

### Approach to the patient: The evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years with low serum testosterone concentration [^112YHvvM]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). High credibility.

His serum FSH was 4.1 IU/L (reference range, 1.0–7.0 IU/L), and LH was 3.2 IU/L (reference range, 1.0–8.0 IU/L).

- **What additional diagnostic evaluation is necessary to exclude classic organic hypothalamic-pituitary pathology in a man with low serum total testosterone and normal serum gonadotropin concentrations**: Most middle-aged and older, obese men with low testosterone will have secondary hypogonadism with normal serum gonadotropin concentrations. Men with secondary hypogonadism should be clinically assessed for Cushing syndrome and sleep apnea. Evaluation for identifiable hypothalamic and pituitary pathology should be individualized because the yield is typically low.

In men ≥ 50 years old with low serum testosterone and normal gonadotropin concentrations, clinical experience suggests that the probability of classic organic hypothalamic-pituitary pathology is inversely related to BMI, age, number of comorbidities, and testosterone concentration. In older, obese men, pseudohypogonadism due to obesity is the most common cause for the biochemical constellation of low serum total testosterone (due to low SHBG), normal serum free testosterone, and normal gonadotropins, reflecting a eugonadal state. In secondary hypogonadism due to structural or genetic hypothalamic-pituitary disorders, gonadotropins are often low or undetectable.

### Testosterone replacement in men with sexual dysfunction [^111cn3Tq]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). High credibility.

Clinical practice guidelines recommend testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) for men with sexual dysfunction and testosterone deficiency. However, TRT is commonly promoted in men without testosterone deficiency, and existing trials often do not clearly report participants' testosterone levels or testosterone-related symptoms. This review assesses the potential benefits and harms of TRT in men presenting with complaints of sexual dysfunction.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of testosterone replacement therapy compared to placebo or other medical treatments in men with sexual dysfunction.

- **Search methods**: We performed a comprehensive search of CENTRAL (the Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the trials registries ClinicalTrials.gov and World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, with no restrictions on language of publication or publication status, up to 29 August 2023.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in men (40 years or over) with sexual dysfunction. We excluded men with primary or secondary hypogonadism. We compared testosterone or testosterone with phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors (PDE5I) to placebo or PDE5I alone.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently screened the literature, assessed the risk of bias, extracted data, and rated the certainty of evidence (CoE) according to GRADE using a minimally contextualized approach. We performed statistical analyses using a random-effects model and interpreted them according to standard Cochrane methodology.

### Approach to the patient: The evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years with low serum testosterone concentration [^115qUems]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Low credibility.

A free testosterone result is most useful in the assessment of a man with intermediate pretest probability of hypogonadism, a condition associated with low serum SHBG and a serum total testosterone that is moderately low to low-normal (i.e. 200–275 ng/dL or 6.94–9.55 nmol/L). Some experts discourage the measurement of free testosterone because of the limitations discussed above, and these experts recommend focusing on the interpretation of total testosterone concentrations in conjunction with SHBG concentrations. However, this approach is congruent with assessment of serum free testosterone with an accurate method. Overall, there is no consistent evidence that free testosterone concentrations are a better measure of androgen status than total testosterone. Further studies to help establish more accurate and uniform methods of assessing free testosterone concentrations and to determine its clinical utility for the diagnosis of hypogonadism are needed. For further discussion about the debate over the clinical value of free testosterone and the accuracy of its calculation/measurement, there are several recent reviews.

Some hypogonadal men with markedly elevated serum SHBG concentrations may have normal or even high serum total testosterone concentrations. Significantly elevated serum SHBG concentrations occur most commonly in the setting of anti-epileptic treatment, chronic liver disease, or chronic daily ingestion of large quantities of alcohol (even in the absence of significant elevation of serum hepatic transaminases).

### Approach to the patient: The evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years with low serum testosterone concentration [^115LrmTB]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). High credibility.

Reproducibly low serum total testosterone concentrations measured by an accurate testosterone assay on a sample drawn in the early morning (7–10 AM) in the fasting state are a cornerstone of the diagnosis of male hypogonadism. It is optimal to use a total testosterone assay that has been validated by an accuracy-based standardization or quality control program, with a normal range of 264–916 ng/dL (9.16–31.8 nmol/L) in healthy, young men. Use of such an assay facilitates application of findings of the T-Trials, the largest randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing testosterone vs. placebo with clinically important outcomes in men with low serum testosterone concentrations, and the soon-to-be-reported TRAVERSE study, a large RCT with cardiovascular outcomes; these trials used a standardized, harmonized total testosterone assay with this normal range.

If the initial serum total testosterone is low, confirmation is required. Without compelling evidence (e.g. specific clinical features such as very small testes and high serum gonadotropin concentrations), androgen deficiency should not be diagnosed with a single low testosterone concentration because of significant diurnal and day-to-day variation. Up to 30% of older men with a low serum testosterone concentration have a normal value on repeat testing. Overnight fasting increases serum testosterone by 9% to 16% and reduces the significant diurnal variability of serum testosterone concentrations. Most experts prefer to err in underdiagnosing testosterone deficiency.

### Approach to the patient: The evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years with low serum testosterone concentration [^11738iP2]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Low credibility.

What additional diagnostic evaluation would be helpful in an older man with a low serum testosterone concentration that has been appropriately confirmed? We have now confirmed that this patient has low serum testosterone concentrations. Does he have nongonadal illness or hypogonadism?

The first step is the determination of serum gonadotropin concentrations. Elevated serum luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) concentrations would be consistent with primary hypogonadism. Primary hypogonadism increases to 2% to 7% prevalence in men over age 70; age over 70 is associated with a progressive decline of serum testosterone concentration and a rise of serum LH concentration (to > 15 IU/L) in many men. If this man has elevated FSH and LH concentrations, then he is hypogonadal. If he has low or normal serum gonadotropin concentrations, then he should be evaluated for causes of hypothalamic and pituitary dysfunction. To minimize phlebotomies and expedite the evaluation, we recommend ordering early morning, fasting serum total testosterone, SHBG, and gonadotropins at the first clinic visit.

Using serum gonadotropins as a pivot in the evaluation of possible hypogonadism is very useful. Although many causes of hypogonadism may affect the central (hypothalamus and/or pituitary) and peripheral (testes) components of the HPT axis, the serum gonadotropins indicate the site of the principal dysfunction. Primary hypogonadism defined by low testosterone concentrations and elevated gonadotropins is generally irreversible in older men, whereas many causes of secondary hypogonadism may be reversible.

### Low free testosterone and prostate cancer risk: A collaborative analysis of 20 prospective studies [^111rtRHy]. European Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Experimental and clinical evidence implicates testosterone in the etiology of prostate cancer. Variation across the normal range of circulating free testosterone concentrations may not lead to changes in prostate biology unless circulating concentrations are low, which may also apply to prostate cancer risk, though this has not been investigated in an epidemiological setting.

- **Objective**: To examine whether men with low concentrations of circulating free testosterone have a reduced risk of prostate cancer.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: Analysis of individual participant data from 20 prospective studies, including 6,933 prostate cancer cases diagnosed on average 6.8 years after blood collection, and 12,088 controls in the Endogenous Hormones, Nutritional Biomarkers and Prostate Cancer Collaborative Group.

- **Outcome measurements and statistical analysis**: Odds ratios (ORs) of incident overall prostate cancer and subtypes by stage and grade, using conditional logistic regression, based on study-specific tenths of calculated free testosterone concentration.

- **Results and limitations**: Men in the lowest tenth of free testosterone concentration had a lower risk of overall prostate cancer (OR = 0.77, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.69–0.86; p < 0.001) compared with men with higher concentrations (2nd–10th tenths of the distribution). Heterogeneity was present by tumor grade (p het = 0.01), with a lower risk of low-grade disease (OR = 0.76, 95% CI 0.67–0.88) and a non-significantly higher risk of high-grade disease (OR = 1.56, 95% CI 0.95–2.57).

### Low free testosterone is associated with hypogonadal signs and symptoms in men with normal total testosterone [^114XFAuG]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

During aging, total testosterone (TT) declines and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) increases, resulting in a greater decrease in calculated free testosterone (cFT). Currently, guidelines suggest using TT to diagnose androgen deficiency and to reserve cFT only for men with borderline TT.

- **Objective**: Our objective was to investigate if either low cFT or low TT is more strongly associated with androgen-related clinical endpoints.

- **Methods**: A total of 3,334 community-dwelling men, aged 40–79 years, were included in this study. Differences in clinical variables between the referent group of men with both normal TT (≥ 10.5 nmol/liter) and normal cFT (≥ 220 pmol/liter) and those who had normal TT/low cFT, low TT/normal cFT, and low TT/low cFT were assessed by regression models adjusted for age, center, body mass index, and comorbidities.

- **Results**: A total of 2,641 men had normal TT (18.4 ± 5.5 [mean ± SD] nmol/liter)/normal cFT (326 ± 74 pmol/liter); 277 men had normal TT (14.2 ± 3.7)/low cFT (194 ± 23); 96 men had low TT (9.6 ± 0.7)/normal cFT (247 ± 20); and 320 men had low TT (7.8 ± 2.5)/low cFT (160 ± 55). Men with normal TT/low cFT were older and in poorer health. They had higher SHBG and luteinizing hormone (LH) and reported more sexual and physical symptoms, whereas hemoglobin and bone ultrasound parameters were lower compared to the referent group. Men with low TT/normal cFT were younger and more obese. They had lower SHBG, but LH was normal, whereas features of androgen deficiency were lacking.

- **Conclusions**: Low cFT, even in the presence of normal TT, is associated with androgen deficiency-related symptoms.

### Approach to the patient: The evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years with low serum testosterone concentration [^113Vw3oH]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023).

**Cardiovascular health**: Effects of testosterone treatment on cardiovascular outcomes remain unknown because there are no published long-term, placebo-controlled RCTs of testosterone therapy and cardiovascular outcomes as a primary outcome. The first such study, TRAVERSE (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03518034), has completed enrollment (n > 5200 men), and the findings of this study, with approximately 5-year follow-up, are expected to be released in 2023; the study was fully recruited and was not ended early for prespecified cardiovascular outcomes [January 2023]. In some observational studies, higher endogenous serum testosterone concentrations have been associated with a decreased risk of cardiovascular events, but higher endogenous serum testosterone might be a marker of better overall health and fewer major comorbidities. Retrospective studies of testosterone treatment have suggested either reduced risks of cardiovascular events, neutral effects, or increased risks; such retrospective studies have significant methodological shortcomings, including confounding by indication (i.e. preferential treatment of healthier men) and time-related biases. Clinical trials of testosterone treatment have been mixed, with one study in older men with mobility limitations reporting an increased risk of cardiovascular events, while there was no increase in a similar trial in frail older men. A total of 17 RCTs shared their individual patient data (n = 3431) with the Testosterone Efficacy and Safety Consortium (TestES) to report mortality and cardiovascular endpoints. Eighteen deaths (6 in testosterone-treated groups) were noted.

### Testosterone replacement therapy for male hypogonadism [^117KbkG9]. American Family Physician (2024). High credibility.

Testosterone deficiency, or male hypogonadism, is a clinical syndrome characterized by persistently low serum testosterone levels alongside symptoms consistent with testosterone deficiency. Studies suggest that testosterone replacement therapy may improve sexual function, depressive symptoms, bone density, and lean body mass. Evidence is conflicting regarding its effect on cardiovascular events and mortality. Although prior studies suggested that testosterone replacement therapy increased the risk of cardiovascular disease, a large randomized trial showed that it does not increase the risk of myocardial infarction or stroke, even in patients at high risk.

After a detailed discussion of the potential benefits and risks through shared decision-making, testosterone replacement therapy should be considered for men with testosterone deficiency to address selected symptoms and induce and maintain secondary sex characteristics. Treatment methods should consider patient preference, pharmacokinetics, potential for medication interactions, formulation-specific adverse effects, treatment burden, and cost. Clinicians should monitor men receiving testosterone replacement therapy for symptom improvement, potential adverse effects, and adherence. Serum testosterone, hematocrit, and prostate-specific antigen levels should be measured at baseline and at least annually in men 40 years or older receiving testosterone replacement therapy.

### Approach to the patient: The evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years with low serum testosterone concentration [^115dU9ax]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). High credibility.

The patient has continued to experience symptoms suggestive of androgen deficiency and has consistently low serum testosterone concentrations. He inquired about testosterone therapy to restore his serum testosterone levels to the normal range. Before considering testosterone therapy, the potential benefits and risks were discussed. Prostate cancer screening was also addressed, as untreated prostate cancer is a contraindication to testosterone therapy. After discussing the benefits and risks of prostate cancer screening, the patient elected to undergo screening. A digital rectal exam revealed no prostate abnormality, and PSA was 1.5 ng/dL.

The potential benefits and risks of testosterone therapy were further discussed due to his persistent symptoms of hypogonadism and consistently low serum testosterone concentrations following a year of addressing reversible causes of a suppressed hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular (HPT) axis, including lifestyle changes to lose weight and optimization of treatment for sleep apnea.

- **Contraindications to testosterone therapy in men**: He was counseled about the potential benefits and risks of testosterone therapy, including the lack of definitive data about the effects on cardiovascular outcomes and prostate cancer, and the absence of high-quality, long-term studies. The patient's main concerns were identified as low libido, reduced energy, and low mood. He was advised that, based on the T-Trials, the effects of testosterone treatment on these symptoms should be evident within 3 to 6 months, while other benefits, such as increased muscle mass, may take longer to manifest.

### Optimizing diagnostic accuracy and treatment decisions in men with testosterone deficiency [^112VkCBb]. Endocrine Practice (2021). Low credibility.

This narrative review offers a guideline-based approach for optimizing diagnostic evaluation and treatment decision-making in men being evaluated for testosterone deficiency.

- **Methods**: A narrative review.

- **Results**: Testosterone deficiency is a clinical syndrome that results from the inability of the testes to produce normal amounts of testosterone and is characterized by a constellation of symptoms and signs associated with consistently low testosterone concentrations. The diagnosis of testosterone deficiency is made by the ascertainment of symptoms and signs; the measurement of total and, if indicated, free testosterone levels in early-morning fasting samples on ≥ 2 days; the measurement of luteinizing hormone and follicular-stimulating hormone levels to distinguish primary from secondary hypogonadism; and an additional evaluation to ascertain the cause of testosterone deficiency. Nonspecificity of symptoms and signs, variations in testosterone levels over time, inaccuracy in the measurement of total and free testosterone levels, variations in binding protein concentrations, and suboptimal reference ranges contribute to diagnostic inaccuracy. Testosterone treatment is indicated for men with symptomatic testosterone deficiency. Testosterone treatment should be avoided in men with prostate or breast cancer, erythrocytosis, thrombophilia, increased risk of prostate cancer or severe lower urinary tract symptoms without prior urologic evaluation, a recent major adverse cardiovascular event, uncontrolled heart failure, or severe untreated sleep apnea.

### Approach to the patient: The evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years with low serum testosterone concentration [^113BAEvt]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). High credibility.

In addition to providing general health benefits, there is evidence that lifestyle changes might increase mean serum testosterone by 10% to 30%. These changes could normalize testosterone concentrations and improve many symptoms that overlap with hypogonadism. However, the data mostly stem from cohort studies of supervised lifestyle interventions. These studies typically involved smaller numbers of participants, who were generally younger (30–50 years of age), with relatively short follow-up periods (< 1–2 years) and variable methodologies in the assessment of serum testosterone concentrations.

- **Challenges in older men**: Some evidence suggests that lifestyle interventions might be less successful in normalizing serum testosterone concentrations and improving function in older and frailer men. The degree to which the increase in serum testosterone is responsible for the improvement seen with androgen deficiency-like features (e.g. erectile function, physical performance) is uncertain.

- **Testosterone treatment and lifestyle interventions**: Whether concomitant testosterone treatment improves the efficacy of lifestyle interventions requires further study. Preliminary evidence suggests that testosterone therapy preserves lean mass compared to placebo during caloric restriction.

In summary, the single most important intervention for our patient and many older men with a high BMI and low serum testosterone concentration might be lifestyle changes (increased exercise, caloric restriction, and improved diet) to reduce weight.

### Approach to the patient: The evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years with low serum testosterone concentration [^112rVxjX]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). High credibility.

Although testosterone replacement in men with classic hypogonadism due to an identified pathology of the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis is uncontroversial, the role of testosterone treatment for men with age-related declines in circulating testosterone is unclear. This ambiguity is due to the lack of large, long-term testosterone therapy trials assessing definitive clinical endpoints. However, men ≥ 50 years of age, particularly those with a body mass index > 25 kg/m² and multiple comorbidities, commonly present with clinical features of androgen deficiency and low serum testosterone concentrations.

Clinicians are faced with the question of whether to initiate testosterone therapy, a difficult dilemma that requires a benefit-risk analysis with limited evidence from clinical trials. Using a case scenario, we present a practical approach to the clinical assessment and management of such men.

### Global consensus position statement on the use of testosterone therapy for women [^112SLFvX]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Low credibility.

There are no clearly established indications for testosterone therapy for women. Nonetheless, clinicians have treated women with testosterone for decades, with the intention of alleviating a variety of symptoms, with uncertain benefits and risks. In most countries, testosterone therapy is prescribed off-label, meaning that women use either testosterone formulations approved for men with dose modification or compounded therapies. Because of these issues, there is a compelling case for a global consensus position statement on testosterone therapy for women based on the available evidence from placebo/comparator randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

This position statement was developed by consensus between the participating organizations to inform health care professionals about the known benefits and potential risks of testosterone therapy for women. The aims were to provide clear guidance on which women might benefit from testosterone therapy, to identify symptoms, signs, and conditions for which evidence does not support the prescribing of testosterone, to explore areas of uncertainty, and to identify any prescribing practices that have the potential to cause harm.
