## Question

A 38-year-old woman presents to her general practitioner with a history of frequent headaches. She reports that her headaches have become more frequent over the past year, now occurring almost daily. She has been purchasing over-the-counter analgesics (paracetamol and ibuprofen) from her local pharmacy and estimates she takes some form of pain relief at least 20 days per month. Her prescription records also show recent prescriptions for triptans. She has not previously seen a headache specialist.

Based on current guidelines, what steps should the general practitioner take to address this patient's risk of medication overuse headache?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what steps a general practitioner should take to address medication overuse headache in a 38-year-old woman with near-daily headaches and frequent use of analgesics and triptans. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and applying ICHD-3 criteria. Then, I should verify medication-specific overuse thresholds. Next, I will consider risk stratification and whether this case can be managed in primary care. After that, I need to outline education and counseling, followed by the withdrawal strategy and whether to add preventive therapy. Finally, I should plan monitoring, relapse prevention, and when to refer, while double-checking areas of controversy and aligning with guidelines throughout.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis using ICHD-3 criteria, and I need to ensure I capture both chronic migraine and medication overuse headache if present. MOH requires headache on 15 or more days per month in someone with a pre-existing primary headache disorder, with regular overuse of acute medications for more than 3 months, and no better explanation for the headache, and patients can carry both chronic migraine and MOH diagnoses simultaneously, which is common in practice [^10b01b88] [^e7a6796c].

> Wait, let me verify the medication-specific overuse thresholds because misapplying them can misclassify the case. For simple analgesics like acetaminophen and NSAIDs, the threshold is 15 or more days per month for more than 3 months, whereas for triptans, ergots, opioids, combination analgesics, and butalbital-containing compounds, the threshold is 10 or more days per month for more than 3 months, so this patient is overusing both simple analgesics and triptans by definition, which meets MOH criteria [^bff668bb] [^e43628c3].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about management setting. I should risk-stratify to decide whether primary care management is appropriate. In the absence of opioid, barbiturate, or benzodiazepine overuse, and without major psychiatric comorbidity or prior relapse, guidelines support initial management in primary care with structured follow-up, reserving specialist referral for complex cases or failure of first-line strategies [^b313d2aa] [^d036109d].

> Next, I should review education and counseling because patient understanding drives adherence and outcomes. I need to explain the paradoxical worsening of headaches with frequent acute medication use, clarify the specific overuse thresholds for each drug class, and set expectations that withdrawal often causes a transient worsening before improvement, using written materials and a headache diary to track progress and reinforce behavior change [^d9a84055] [^ddc38833].

> I will now examine the withdrawal strategy, and I should confirm whether abrupt cessation is acceptable here. For simple analgesics and triptans without opioid or barbiturate involvement, abrupt withdrawal is generally preferred and supported by guidelines, whereas opioids and barbiturates require slow tapering to avoid withdrawal seizures or severe rebound, so I should explicitly exclude those before choosing abrupt cessation [^575df0a7] [^36ed8d8b].

> But wait, what if I add preventive therapy at the same time as withdrawal? Does that help or hurt? The evidence is mixed and guidelines diverge, with some recommending early preventive therapy to support withdrawal and others citing insufficient evidence for a universal approach. Pragmatically, given high relapse risk and disability, I should offer preventive therapy now or within 2–4 weeks of withdrawal, selecting from topiramate, onabotulinumtoxinA, or anti-CGRP monoclonal antibodies based on comorbidities, contraindications, and access, while acknowledging that topiramate is contraindicated in women of childbearing potential and that CGRP mAbs are reasonable options when available [^5bf55860] [^e9d1dc39] [^78c8e95d].

> Let me think about supportive measures during withdrawal because patients often experience a temporary increase in headache frequency and intensity. I should provide anticipatory guidance, consider short-term bridge therapy such as a brief steroid taper for severe withdrawal headaches in select cases, and ensure close follow-up in the first 4–6 weeks to manage symptoms and reinforce adherence, recognizing that evidence for steroids is limited and should be individualized [^f04ec02e] [^d9a84055].

> Next, I should review monitoring and relapse prevention, and I need to ensure a structured plan. I will schedule follow-up every 4–6 weeks initially, then extend to every 3–6 months once stable, use a headache diary to track monthly headache days and acute medication days, and proactively address modifiable risk factors for chronification such as obesity, anxiety, depression, sleep disturbance, caffeine overuse, and physical inactivity, as these influence relapse and disability [^eaefc1f3] [^ddc38833] [^744eb33b].

> Hold on, I should verify when to escalate care or refer. Indications for specialist referral include failure of advice alone, relapse after initial withdrawal, overuse of opioids or barbiturates, complex psychiatric comorbidity, or diagnostic uncertainty, and I should maintain a low threshold for referral if the patient does not improve as expected or if withdrawal fails despite good adherence [^d036109d] [^da9a23a6].

> Let me reconsider the overall approach to ensure internal consistency with guidelines. The safest, evidence-aligned sequence is to confirm MOH with ICHD-3 and medication counts, educate the patient thoroughly, implement abrupt withdrawal for non-addictive acute medications, initiate preventive therapy tailored to the underlying headache disorder and patient factors, monitor closely with diaries and regular visits, and refer when complexity or failure emerges, which balances benefits and risks while acknowledging areas of guideline disagreement about timing of preventive therapy [^10b01b88] [^575df0a7] [^78c8e95d].

This patient has **medication overuse headache (MOH)** [^10b01b88] due to frequent use of analgesics and triptans [^e43628c3]. The GP should confirm the diagnosis with a **headache diary** [^65ccabab] and **education** [^7d9c194c] on MOH and the need to stop overused medications [^e76af10c]. Abrupt withdrawal of triptans and NSAIDs is appropriate [^575df0a7]; for opioids or barbiturates, taper slowly [^36ed8d8b]. Start preventive therapy (topiramate, onabotulinumtoxinA, or a CGRP monoclonal antibody) [^5bf55860] to reduce headache frequency and support withdrawal [^d0d5a6ab]. Arrange close follow-up to monitor withdrawal, relapse, and response [^45081863], and refer to a headache specialist if overuse persists or comorbidities complicate management [^d036109d].

---

## Step 1: confirm diagnosis and establish baseline

- **Headache diary**: Ask the patient to record headache days, severity, and medication use for at least 1 month [^e7a6796c] to confirm MOH and identify patterns [^65ccabab].

- **Medication history**: Document all OTC and prescription analgesics, triptans, and other acute medications, including frequency and quantity [^65ccabab].

- **Neurological examination**: Perform a focused exam to exclude secondary causes and establish baseline status [^65ccabab].

---

## Step 2: patient education and counseling

Explain that **MOH is a secondary headache disorder** [^76c936a3] caused by regular overuse of acute headache medications, with a prevalence of 1–2% in the general population [^e43628c3]. Emphasize that **withdrawal of overused medications is essential** [^11746fda] and that most patients improve with treatment, though initial worsening may occur [^575df0a7]. Provide **written materials and resources** [^7d9c194c] to support understanding and adherence [^d9a84055].

---

## Step 3: medication withdrawal strategy

- **Abrupt withdrawal**: For simple analgesics (NSAIDs, acetaminophen) and triptans, abrupt cessation is appropriate and preferred [^575df0a7] [^b313d2aa].

- **Tapered withdrawal**: For opioids, barbiturates, or benzodiazepines, taper slowly to avoid withdrawal symptoms [^36ed8d8b] [^8388e3c9].

- **Supportive care**: Provide anticipatory guidance on withdrawal headaches and nausea; consider short-term bridge therapy (e.g. corticosteroids) for severe withdrawal symptoms [^f04ec02e].

---

## Step 4: initiate preventive therapy

- **Indications**: Start preventive therapy in patients with frequent headaches, MOH, or significant disability [^e551a8db].

- **Options**: Topiramate, onabotulinumtoxinA, or anti-CGRP monoclonal antibodies are evidence-based choices [^5bf55860]; select based on comorbidities, contraindications, and patient preference [^e551a8db].

- **Timing**: Preventive therapy can be started at withdrawal or shortly thereafter to support adherence and reduce relapse [^d33d6d32] [^eecd9a8a].

---

## Step 5: monitoring and follow-up

Schedule **regular visits** every 2–4 weeks initially, then extend to every 3–6 months once stable [^eaefc1f3]. Track **headache frequency, severity, and medication use** with diaries or e-diaries to guide care and detect relapse [^ddc38833]. Address modifiable risk factors — obesity, anxiety/depression, sleep disturbances, caffeine overuse, and physical inactivity — to reduce relapse risk [^744eb33b].

---

## Step 6: referral to specialist care

Refer when **opioid, barbiturate, or benzodiazepine overuse** is present, or when withdrawal fails despite advice and support [^d036109d]. Consider referral for **complex comorbidities** (psychiatric disorders, substance use, or refractory headache) or when multiple withdrawal attempts fail [^da9a23a6].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Step** | **Action** | **Details** |
|-|-|-|
| 1 | Confirm diagnosis | - Headache diary <br/> - Medication history <br/> - Neurological exam |
| 2 | Education | - Explain MOH <br/> - Emphasize withdrawal <br/> - Provide resources |
| 3 | Withdrawal | - Abrupt for NSAIDs/triptans <br/> - Taper for opioids/barbiturates |
| 4 | Preventive therapy | - Topiramate <br/> - OnabotulinumtoxinA <br/> - Anti-CGRP mAbs |
| 5 | Monitoring | - Regular follow-up <br/> - Track headache/medication use |
| 6 | Referral | - Complex cases <br/> - Failed withdrawal <br/> - Comorbidities |

---

The GP should confirm MOH, educate the patient, withdraw overused medications appropriately, start preventive therapy, and monitor closely, referring to a headache specialist when needed. This approach is **evidence-based** and aligns with current guidelines [^e76af10c] [^575df0a7].

### Medication overuse headache: an entrenched idea in need of scrutiny [^51ac1b26]. Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

It is a widely accepted idea that medications taken to relieve acute headache pain can paradoxically worsen headache if used too often. This type of secondary headache is referred to as medication overuse headache (MOH); previously used terms include rebound headache and drug-induced headache. In the absence of consensus about the duration of use, amount, and type of medication needed to cause MOH, the default position is conservative. A common recommendation is to limit treatment to no more than 10 or 15 days per month (depending on medication type) to prevent headache frequency progression. Medication withdrawal is often recommended as a first step in treatment of patients with very frequent headaches. Existing evidence, however, does not provide a strong basis for such causal claims about the relationship between medication use and frequent headache. Observational studies linking treatment patterns with headache frequency are by their nature confounded by indication. Medication withdrawal studies have mostly been uncontrolled and often have high dropout rates. Evaluation of this evidence suggests that only a minority of patients required to limit the use of symptomatic medication may benefit from treatment limitation. Similarly, only a minority of patients deemed to be overusing medications may benefit from withdrawal. These findings raise serious questions about the value of withholding or withdrawing symptom-relieving medications from people with frequent headaches solely to prevent or treat MOH. The benefits of doing so are smaller, and the harms larger, than currently recognized. The concept of MOH should be viewed with more skepticism. Until the evidence is better, we should avoid dogmatism about the use of symptomatic medication. Frequent use of symptom-relieving headache medications should be viewed more neutrally, as an indicator of poorly controlled headaches, and not invariably a cause.

### Pathophysiology, prevention, and treatment of medication overuse headache [^e76af10c]. The Lancet: Neurology (2019). High credibility.

Regular or frequent use of analgesics and acute antimigraine drugs can increase the frequency of headache, and induce the transition from episodic to chronic headache or medication overuse headache. The 1-year prevalence of this condition in the general population is between 1% and 2%. Medication overuse headache is more common in women and in people with comorbid depression, anxiety, and other chronic pain conditions. Treatment of medication overuse headache has three components. First, patients need education and counselling to reduce the intake of medication for acute headache attacks. Second, some patients benefit from drug withdrawal (discontinuation of the overused medication). Finally, preventive drug therapy and non-medical prevention might be necessary in patients at onset of treatment or in patients who do not respond to the first two steps. The optimal therapeutic approach requires validation in controlled trials.

### Medication-overuse headache: risk factors, pathophysiology and management [^76043cc8]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2016). Medium credibility.

Medication-overuse headache (MOH) is defined by the International Classification of Headache Disorders as a headache in patients with a pre-existing primary headache disorder that occurs on ≥ 15 days per month for > 3 months, and is caused by overuse of medication intended for acute or symptomatic headache treatment. The prevalence of MOH in the general population is around 1%, but the condition is much more common in people with headache, in particular chronic migraine. The phenotype of the headache in MOH depends on the initial primary headache and the type of overused acute medication. In this Review, we will discuss the epidemiology, risk factors, pathophysiology, prevention and treatment of MOH. Treatment of MOH is performed in three steps: educating patients about the relationship between frequent intake of acute headache medication and MOH with the aim to reduce intake of acute medication; initiation of migraine prevention (such as topiramate or onabotulinumtoxin A in migraine) in patients who fail step 1; detoxification on an outpatient basis or in a day hospital or inpatient setting, depending on severity and comorbidities. The success rate of treatment is around 50–70%, although patients whose MOH is associated with opioid overuse have higher relapse rates. In all patients with MOH, relapse rates can be reduced by patient education and care in the follow-up period.

### Medication-overuse headache [^225c19d4]. Practical Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Medication-overuse headache is defined as headache occurring on more than 15days in a month in people with pre-existing primary headache, and developing as a consequence of regular overuse of acute headache treatments. Medication-overuse headache is common in general neurology clinics and can be difficult to manage. Most patients have a background of migraine, which has slowly transformed over months and years from the episodic to chronic form; with this comes an increased use of acute migraine treatment. This paper identifies who is at risk of developing medication-overuse headache, and reviews preventive measures and current treatment strategies.

### Medication-overuse headache: a review [^f4a596f2]. Journal of Pain Research (2014). Low credibility.

Medication-overuse headache (MOH) is a worldwide health problem with a prevalence of 1%-2%. It is a severe form of headache where the patients often have a long history of headache and of unsuccessful treatments. MOH is characterized by chronic headache and overuse of different headache medications. Through the years, withdrawal of the overused medication has been recognized as the treatment of choice. However, currently, there is no clear consensus regarding the optimal strategy for management of MOH. Treatment approaches are based on expert opinion rather than scientific evidence. This review focuses on aspects of epidemiology, diagnosis, pathogenesis, prevention, and treatment of MOH. We suggest that information and education about the risk of MOH is important since the condition is preventable. Most patients experience reduction of headache days and intensity after successful treatment. The first step in the treatment of MOH should be carried out in primary care and focus primarily on withdrawal, leaving prophylactic medication to those who do not manage primary detoxification. For most patients, a general practitioner can perform the follow-up after detoxification. More complicated cases should be referred to neurologists and headache clinics. Patients suffering with MOH have much to gain by an earlier treatment-focused approach, since the condition is both preventable and treatable.

### Frequent headaches: evaluation and management [^65ccabab]. American Family Physician (2020). Medium credibility.

Most frequent headaches are typically migraine or tension-type headaches and are often exacerbated by medication overuse. Repeated headaches can induce central sensitization and transformation to chronic headaches that are intractable, are difficult to treat, and cause significant morbidity and costs. A complete history is essential to identify the most likely headache type, indications of serious secondary headaches, and significant comorbidities. A headache diary can document headache frequency, symptoms, initiating and exacerbating conditions, and treatment response over time. Neurologic assessment and physical examination focused on the head and neck are indicated in all patients. Although rare, serious underlying conditions must be excluded by the patient history, screening tools such as SNNOOP10, neurologic and physical examinations, and targeted imaging and other assessments. Medication overuse headache should be suspected in patients with frequent headaches. Medication history should include nonprescription analgesics and substances, including opiates, that may be obtained from others. Patients who overuse opiates, barbiturates, or benzodiazepines require slow tapering and possibly inpatient treatment to prevent acute withdrawal. Patients who overuse other agents can usually withdraw more quickly. Evidence is mixed on the role of medications such as topiramate for patients with medication overuse headache. For the underlying headache, an individualized evidence-based management plan incorporating pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic strategies is necessary. Patients with frequent migraine, tension-type, and cluster headaches should be offered prophylactic therapy. A complete management plan includes addressing risk factors, headache triggers, and common comorbid conditions such as depression, anxiety, substance abuse, and chronic musculoskeletal pain syndromes that can impair treatment effectiveness. Regular scheduled follow-up is important to monitor progress.

Step 8: Managing complications

Medication overuse headache

MOH is a chronic headache disorder characterized by headache on ≥ 15 days per month. It develops over a variable period of time in patients with a pre-existing headache disorder as a result of regular overuse of acute or symptomatic headache medication. Patients with migraine account for approximately two thirds of all cases of MOH, although this estimate is based on limited evidence and might be too low.

Withdrawal of the overused medication is the necessary and only remedy for MOH. Expert consensus is that abrupt withdrawal is preferable to slow withdrawal, except for opioids. This process can be managed in primary care unless addictive drugs, such as opioids, are involved. Patient education is a key component of the clinical management of MOH, as withdrawal is usually followed by worsening before recovery. Preventive therapy (pharmacological and/or non-pharmacological) appropriate to the antecedent headache can be started in parallel with acute medication withdrawal or upon re-emergence of the headache disorder, although this topic remains a subject of debate.

### Medication-overuse headache: causes, consequences and management [^e43628c3]. Journal of Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Medication-overuse headache (MOH) has a prevalence of approximately 1% and is among the top 20 causes of disability worldwide, leading to considerable medical, social, and economic costs. It is defined in the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD-3) as a headache occurring on at least 15 days per month in someone with a pre-existing headache disorder and developing as a result of regular overuse of one or more acute/symptomatic headache treatments for at least 3 months. Overuse is defined as at least 10 days per month for triptans, opioids and ergotamine, or at least 15 days per month for paracetamol, aspirin, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. The frequency of acute medication use seems more important in the development of MOH than the cumulative dosage taken. MOH most often develops in those with underlying migraine or tension-type headache, but it can occur with other primary headache disorders such as cluster headache or new daily persistent headache. The quality of the headache is often similar to that of the underlying headache disorder which can make diagnosis of MOH difficult unless symptomatic improvement after acute drug withdrawal is observed. Women are four times as likely to develop MOH as men with peak prevalence at age 40–50. Other risk factors associated with MOH include obesity, anxiety or depression, low educational level, smoking, chronic musculoskeletal or gastrointestinal diseases, and physical inactivity. Treatment strategies include drug withdrawal, with or without preventive medication cover, and patient education.

This month's journal club examines three papers reporting on the causes, consequences and treatments of MOH. The first is a systematic review and critical appraisal of gene polymorphism association studies, assessing the evidence for genetic predisposition to MOH. The second examines association between MOH and suicidal ideation and the third reports an open-label, randomized clinical trial of three treatment strategies.

### Medication overuse headache [^76c936a3]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2023). High credibility.

Medication overuse headache (MOH) is a secondary headache disorder attributed to overuse of acute headache medications by a person with an underlying headache disorder, usually migraine or tension-type headache. MOH is common among individuals with 15 or more headache days per month. Although MOH is associated with substantial disability and reductions in quality of life, this condition is often under-recognized. As MOH is both preventable and treatable, it warrants greater attention and awareness. The diagnosis of MOH is based on the history and an unremarkable neurological examination, and is made according to the diagnostic criteria of the International Classification of Headache Disorders third edition (ICHD-3). Pathophysiological mechanisms of MOH include altered descending pain modulation, central sensitization and biobehavioural factors. Treatment of MOH includes the use of headache preventive therapies, but essential to success is eliminating the cause, by reducing the frequency of use of acute headache medication, and perhaps withdrawing the overused medication altogether. Appropriate treatment is usually highly effective, leading to reduced headache burden and acute medication consumption.

Conclusion

MOH is common and debilitating, has a widely variable phenotype, usually arises as a result of inadequate long-term treatment of an underlying headache disorder and can be associated with an increased suicide risk. The aetiology of this condition remains unclear, but any candidate gene associations are likely to require confirmation in an unbiased genome-wide association study. Drug withdrawal strategies are effective but need to be coupled with patient education on the risks of analgesic overuse to prevent relapse.

Medication overuse headache (MOH) is defined as a new or worsening headache occurring more than 15 days a month in people with a pre-existing primary headache that develops as a result of regular overuse of acute headache treatments. MOH is a common secondary headache disorder with an estimated prevalence of 1% to 5%. The presence of a pre-existing primary headache disorder is the main risk factor for MOH.

### Management of medication overuse headache [^52c9f1a3]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2010). Low credibility.

Headache is one of the most frequent reasons for medical consultation in both general practice and specialist neurology clinics.1 Prescribed and over-the-counter medications are taken to alleviate headaches, but may be used incorrectly.2 In particular, use of some drugs both frequently and regularly can have a paradoxical effect, causing headaches rather than relieving them, and leading to medication overuse headache (MOH).3 Such overuse is a common cause of frequent headache. Here we review MOH and its management.

### Medication-overuse headache: a review [^2345b8ef]. Journal of Pain Research (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusion

MOH is a treatable and preventable public health problem worldwide. The improvements seen in two of three MOH patients after withdrawal suggest that detoxification is the logical first step in treatment. Prevention as well as treatment should probably be attempted in primary care, leaving the more complicated cases to neurologists. The gain from treating patients with MOH is potentially high, and may lead to substantial economic savings for society as well as for individual patients.

### Medication-overuse headache: a review [^5b8a3ff0]. Journal of Pain Research (2014). Low credibility.

Prevention

A small study from England reported that both people with headache and those without headache were unaware of the risk of MOH resulting from frequent analgesic use for headache. Other studies have found that most MOH patients do not know about the relationship between medication-overuse and headache chronification. The authors suggest it is possible that the patients had been informed but did not remember or had not fully understood the information. In a German study, a brochure on medication-overuse helped to prevent development of MOH in people with migraine and frequent medication use.

Considering that possibly anyone with primary episodic headache may be at risk of developing MOH, the number of people at risk is high. Adding the fact that, in many cases, just simple advice leads to successful medication withdrawal, the potential benefit of giving information on MOH is high. New information campaigns and strategies to target people at risk have to be developed.

Given that most patients with MOH have been in contact with a general practitioner, and almost half have had such contact in the previous year, primary care is probably the ideal setting for prevention and treatment of headache and medication-overuse. The general practitioner has a key role in providing patient education and prophylactic headache medication before headaches become chronic. Further, general practitioners have the continued and clear responsibility for the patients over time. This long-term alliance with their own patients may further enhance the treatment effects and avoidance of relapse. Taking care of uncomplicated cases in primary care may also free up more resources for referrals to neurologists of complicated cases.

### Medication-overuse headache: a worldwide problem [^c20838b6]. The Lancet: Neurology (2004). Medium credibility.

Medication overuse and subsequent medication-overuse headache (MOH) is a growing problem worldwide. Epidemiological data suggest that up to 4% of the population overuse analgesics and other drugs for the treatment of pain conditions such as migraine and that about 1% of the general population in Europe, North America, and Asia have MOH. Recent clinical studies gave further insights in clinical and pharmacological features, such as critical monthly doses and frequencies. These features seem to vary significantly and depend on the primary headache disorder and the type of drug that is overused. Along with these findings the new international classification of headache disorders has now incorporated additional criteria and new headache entities that will facilitate the diagnosis of MOH. Withdrawal therapy is the only treatment for this disorder and clear restriction of monthly doses is the central requirement for successful prevention.

### European Academy of Neurology guideline on the management of medication-overuse headache [^8388e3c9]. European Journal of Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The frequent use of medication to treat migraine attacks can lead to an increase in migraine frequency and is called medication-overuse headache (MOH).

Methods

Based on the available literature in this guideline, the first step in patient management is education and counselling.

Results

Patients with MOH should be managed by a multidisciplinary team of neurologists or pain specialists and behavioral psychologists. Patients in whom education is not effective should be withdrawn from overused drugs and should receive preventive treatment with drugs of proven efficacy. Patients with MOH in whom preventive treatment is not effective should undergo drug withdrawal. Drug intake can be abruptly terminated or restricted in patients overusing simple analgesics, ergots or triptan medication. In patients with long-lasting abuse of opioids, barbiturates or tranquilizers, slow tapering of these drugs is recommended. Withdrawal can be performed on an outpatient basis or in a daycare or inpatient setting.

### Prevention and management of medication overuse headache [^9170370f]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review provides an update on our knowledge regarding prevention and management of medication overuse headache (MOH).

Recent Findings

The prevalence of MOH is 1–2% in the general population worldwide, and because of the tremendous socio-economic cost, it is likely to be the most costly neurological disorder known. MOH has similarities with traditional drug addiction. Use of a brochure on medication overuse can prevent MOH. The Severity of Dependence Scale (SDS) score is a significant predictor of medication overuse among headache patients. Withdrawal of medication is essential in the management of MOH, and simultaneous initiation of prophylactic medication may alleviate this process. Short advice on medication overuse by a physician reduced mean medication days from 22 to 6 days; 76% no longer had medication overuse and 42% no longer had chronic headache.

Summary

A brochure and/or the SDS should be used to prevent MOH. Withdrawal is the cornerstone of MOH management. Short advice on MOH is the current most cost effective management method, a method that can be applied anywhere including third world countries.

Step 5: Preventive treatment

Initiation and termination

In patients whose migraine continues to impair their quality of life despite optimized acute therapy, additional preventive therapy should be considered (Table 4). In practice, patients who are considered for preventive treatment remain adversely affected on at least 2 days per month, although this should not be regarded as an absolute rule. Aside from migraine frequency, clinicians should always consider factors such as the severity of attacks, the duration of attacks (for example, menstruation-related attacks tend to last longer) and migraine-related disability. A further indication for preventive therapy is overuse of acute medication.

Table 4
Preventive migraine treatment

SSRI, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor. a Sodium valproate is absolutely contraindicated in women of childbearing potential.

Efficacy of preventive therapy is rarely observed immediately. Only after several weeks or months can efficacy be ascertained, so patients should be discouraged from abandoning the treatment in these early stages on the grounds of apparent inefficacy. If a therapeutic dose of an oral preventive medication is ineffective after 2–3 months, an alternative should be tried. For monoclonal antibody treatments that target calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) or its receptor, efficacy should be assessed only after 3–6 months. For onabotulinumtoxinA, efficacy should be assessed after 6–9 months.

Failure of one preventive treatment does not predict failure of treatment with other drug classes, except when failure is due to poor adherence. Treatment adherence is often very poor but can be improved by simplified dosing schedules (once daily or less). For most preventive medications, clinical experience suggests that pausing can be considered when treatment has been successful for 6–12 months. The purpose of pausing is to ascertain whether preventive treatment can be stopped, which minimizes the risk of unnecessary drug exposure and allows some patients to manage their migraine with acute medications only. A useful measure to quantify the degree of preventive treatment success is to calculate the percentage reduction in monthly migraine days or monthly headache days of moderate-to-severe intensity. However, a pragmatic approach is needed and clinicians should decide to pause preventive therapy on a case-by-case basis.

### Medication-overuse headache: causes, consequences and management [^eecd9a8a]. Journal of Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

After 6 months, there was a reduction in headache days per month in each of the three treatment groups [withdrawal − 8.5 days (95% CI 5.6–11.5); withdrawal plus preventive − 12.3 days (95% CI 9.3–15.3); preventive alone − 9.9 days (95% CI 7.2–12.6)] with no significant difference between the three groups. An analysis of secondary endpoints at 6 months showed that the withdrawal plus preventive strategy conferred a modest but significant advantage over the other two strategies. For example, withdrawal plus preventive was 80% more likely to promote conversion from chronic to episodic headache than withdrawal alone (relative risk 1.8 (95% CI, 1.1–2.8; p = 0.03).

Comment: This pragmatic study directly compared three simple outpatient strategies for treating MOH and showed that they are all effective, with withdrawal plus preventive being marginally favoured. Limitations of this study included the small sample sizes, the lack of a no treatment group, and the heterogeneity of the population. For example, the underlying headache diagnosis, the medications overused, the duration of MOH, and the preventives prescribed were all variable. The small sample sizes prevented subgroup analyses to assess the impact of these factors.

### What predicts the change from episodic to chronic migraine? [^81f9f35b]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Because migraine worsens in a sizeable subgroup of sufferers, but not in most, identifying factors that predict the change from episodic into chronic migraine is of extreme interest and should be seen as a priority in headache research.

Recent Findings

Potentially remediable risk factors include frequency of migraine attacks, obesity, excessive use of medications containing opioids and barbiturates, caffeine overuse, stressful life events, depression, sleep disorders and cutaneous allodynia.

Summary

While we wait for evidence regarding the benefits of risk factor modifications in the prevention of chronic migraine, several interventions are justifiable based on their other established benefits. For example, decreasing headache frequency with behavioral and pharmacological interventions will decrease current disability even if it does not modify clinical course. Monitoring the body mass index and encouraging maintenance of normal body weight is good practice in patients with and without migraine. Avoiding overuse of caffeine is desirable apart from its potential benefit in preventing progression. Sleep problems should be investigated and treated. Psychiatric comorbidities should be identified and addressed. Medications containing opioids and barbiturates should be reserved for a few selected cases of migraine, and their use should be monitored. For these interventions, the possibility of preventing progression may motivate clinicians to offer good care and patients to engage in the treatment plan.

Medication-overuse headache

Medication-overuse headache is headache occurring on 15 or more days per month, developing as a consequence of regular overuse of acute or symptomatic headache medication (simple analgesics and NSAIDs on 15 days or more; or triptans, opioids and combination analgesics on 10 days or more days per month) for over 3 months. It occurs in patients with pre-existing primary headache who, in association with regular acute medication use, develop a new type of headache or a marked worsening of their pre-existing headache. Phenotypically, the headaches usually resemble migraine or tension-type headache.

Medication-overuse headache is a common, frequently debilitating, sequel to pre-existing headache. Headaches develop on withdrawal of analgesics, triggering more analgesic usage, leading to a self-perpetuating cycle. The problem is more severe with overuse of triptans and opiates than, for example, NSAIDs and simple analgesics, but can develop following overuse of any analgesic. A detailed look at a patient's list of over-the-counter medication can be quite revealing (table 5).

Table 5
Common over-the-counter migraine acute treatments

Unfortunately, the process of withdrawing from analgesics is often challenging. Patients may develop not only a withdrawal or rebound headache but also nausea and other gastrointestinal disturbances (about a week for triptan withdrawal and up to 4 weeks for opiates and codeine-based medication). Before withdrawal, it is important that the patient is fully aware of the likely initial worsening of symptoms. The overused abortives should ideally be stopped for at least 1 month. It can be encouraging to the patient to explain the evidence that medication withdrawal alone can improve the headaches (see figure 3).

Figure 3
Headache frequency after medication withdrawal in medication-overuse headache. This Danish study of people with probable medication-overuse headache (175 patients) compared the frequency of headache before and after complete drug withdrawal and then after drug management in the clinic. Between the initial visit (before withdrawal) and discharge from clinic post-withdrawal, there was a mean reduction in headache frequency across the cohort of 46% (p < 0.0001). The values represent mean reduction in headache days per month with median and range in brackets. ✱ p < 0.0001 (adapted from Zeeburg et al).

### Medication-overuse headache: a review [^5da480cf]. Journal of Pain Research (2014). Low credibility.

Therefore, based on today's knowledge, we suggest that initial withdrawal is the treatment of choice. Prophylactic headache medication should be restricted to patients who do not benefit sufficiently from cessation of medication-overuse, and those who have previously failed withdrawal attempts or have significant comorbidity. Some authors contest this view since many MOH patients are already suffering and heavily disabled before starting a possible troublesome detoxification with withdrawal symptoms. However, it is an aim in itself to achieve a behavioral change and to restructure the approach from "have pain – take tablet" thinking to better ways of handling headache. In addition, a period free of medication-overuse has been suggested to lead to recovery of prophylactic responsiveness. For patients still needing prophylactic medication after withdrawal, the choice should be based on the underlying primary headache, comorbidity, and possible side effects of treatment. Other more experimental treatments, such as surgery and neuromodulation, have conflicting results and should not be recommended before new evidence clearly demonstrates a clinical effect.

Transformation to chronic migraine

Some estimates suggest that up to 3% of patients with episodic migraine experience transformation to chronic migraine each year. The reliability of such estimates is uncertain because chronic migraine is often conflated with MOH, but transformation to chronic migraine does occur. Recognized risk factors include female sex, a high headache frequency, inadequate treatment, overuse of acute medications and a range of comorbidities, including depression, anxiety and obesity –. Recognition of these risk factors is part of good clinical management, as their modification can prevent transformation.

Once chronic migraine has developed, its management is challenging and referral to specialist care is usually necessary. If MOH, which frequently causes symptoms that suggest chronic migraine, can be ruled out, then a preventive treatment should be established. Individuals with chronic migraine should also be educated on the modifiable risk factors for chronic migraine so that they can make lifestyle changes that might help.

Preventive medications for which evidence supports effectiveness in chronic migraine include topiramate, onabotulinumtoxinAand CGRP monoclonal antibodies. Topiramate is the drug of first choice owing to its much lower cost. Regulatory restrictions generally limit the use of onabotulinumtoxinA and CGRP antibodies to patients in whom two or three other preventive medications have failed, despite the fact that topiramate is the only other treatment with evidence supporting its use. Three CGRP antibodies (erenumab, fremanezumab and galcanezumab) have been proven to be beneficial for patients in whom at least two other preventive medications have failed –. As in episodic migraine, the choice of preventive medication and their order of use depends on local practice guidelines, availability, cost and reimbursement policies. No robust data from random controlled trials support the use of beta blockers, candesartan or amitriptyline for the preventive treatment of chronic migraine, although they are commonly used in clinical practice.

Recommendations

Educate patients with migraine about the risk of MOH with frequent overuse of acute medication.
Manage established MOH by explanation and withdrawal of the overused medication; abrupt withdrawal is preferred, except for opioids.
Recognize and, when possible, modify risk factors for the transformation of episodic migraine to chronic migraine.
Refer patients with chronic migraine to specialist care.
Once MOH is ruled out, initiate preventive medication therapy for chronic migraine; evidence-based treatment options are topiramate, onabotulinumtoxinA and CGRP monoclonal antibodies.

### Risk factors for migraine disease progression: a narrative review for a patient-centered approach [^0d3c3d5d]. Journal of Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

In individuals with migraine, attacks may increase in frequency, severity, or both. Preventing migraine progression has emerged as a treatment goal in headache subspecialty practice, but there may be less awareness in general neurology or primary care settings where most people with migraine who seek treatment consult. Herein, we review the definition of and risk factors for migraine progression and consider strategies that could reduce its risk.

Methods

A group of headache expert healthcare professionals, clinicians, and researchers reviewed published evidence documenting factors associated with increased or decreased rates of migraine progression and established expert opinions for disease management recommendations. Strength of evidence was rated as good, moderate, or based solely on expert opinion, using modified criteria for causation developed by AB Hill.

Results

Migraine progression is commonly operationally defined as the transition from ≤ 15 to ≥ 15 monthly headache days among people with migraine; however, this does not necessarily constitute a fundamental change in migraine biology and other definitions should be considered. Established and theoretical key risk factors for migraine progression were categorized into five domains: migraine disease characteristics, treatment-related factors, comorbidities, lifestyle/exogenous factors, and demographic factors. Within these domains, good evidence supports the following risk factors: poorly optimized acute headache treatment, cutaneous allodynia, acute medication overuse, selected psychiatric symptoms, extra-cephalic chronic pain conditions, metabolism-related comorbidities, sleep disturbances, respiratory conditions, former/current high caffeine intake, physical inactivity, financial constraints, tobacco use, and personal triggers as risk factors. Protective actions that may mitigate migraine progression are sparsely investigated in published literature; our discussion of these factors is primarily based on expert opinion.

Conclusions

Recognizing risk factors for migraine progression will allow healthcare providers to suggest protective actions against migraine progression (Supplementary Fig. 1). Intervention studies are needed to weight the risk factors and test the clinical benefit of hypothesized mitigation strategies that emerge from epidemiological evidence.

Medication overuse headache (MOH) patient evaluation and reporting — patient-centered considerations — note that patients generally appreciate a thorough evaluation including their history to determine diagnosis and risks; patients might report only the number of moderate to severe headache days per month rather than total headache days, so one approach is to inquire about the number of days in the last month without any headache, while recognizing some patients might be reluctant to discuss or change behaviors such as smoking or exercise habits.

Introduction

Effective management of patients' migraine is often inadequate, and treatments are associated with unintended consequences. Frequent use of acute medications, including opiates, cannabinoids, barbiturates, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), as well as migraine-specific medications (e.g. triptans), can lead to medication overuse headache (MOH), characterized by increased frequency of headache attacks, increased pain intensity, and increased disability. Novel drugs with new mechanisms of action have recently been approved, but it is unknown whether these will also carry the risk of inducing MOH in vulnerable patients. MOH is defined in the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD-3) as a headache that (a) develops as a consequence of regular overuse of symptomatic headache medication in a person with a preexisting headache disorder and (b) occurs on > 14 days/month for > 3 months and cannot be better accounted for by another ICHD-3 diagnosis. The prevalence of MOH has been estimated at 1% to 2% in the general population and is among the top 20 causes of years lived with disability. Multiple drug classes are used for the acute treatment of headaches and, to date, almost all are implicated in the development of MOH. Medication overuse is a risk factor in the transformation of episodic migraine to chronic migraine, which is associated with decreased quality of life (,–). The need for novel drugs that are effective in the acute treatment of migraine but that do not provoke development of MOH is desired by both patients and clinicians.

### Assessing and managing medication overuse headache in Australian clinical practice [^d0d5a6ab]. BMJ Neurology Open (2023). High credibility.

Key points

Medication overuse headache (MOH) is a complex condition associated with high rates of withdrawal failure and relapse.
Treatment of MOH involves withdrawal of the causative acute migraine medication with the aim to cease medication overuse and reduce monthly migraine days to a pattern of well-controlled episodic migraine.
Education plays a vital role in engaging and motivating people to be proactive in effectively managing MOH and preventing relapses, and in supporting withdrawal compliance.
Preventive treatment with topiramate, onabotulinumtoxinA or anti-calcitonin gene-related peptide monoclonal antibodies can be effective in supporting withdrawal compliance and potentially increasing MOH remission rates.

### Behavioural intervention in medication overuse headache: a concealed double-blind randomized controlled trial [^f2deea99]. European Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

To reduce the burden of chronic disorders, many nonpharmacological interventions, such as behavioural therapy, lifestyle intervention, and mindfulness, are being studied and suggested to be effective. Similarly, in headache disorders, psychological treatment seems beneficial, although recommendations on these therapies are hampered due to the quality of available research. A major concern regarding research in this field is the risk of bias by awareness of the received treatment, as it is difficult to perform blinded trials due to the nature of the intervention. As such, evidence is mainly based on observational or nonblinded randomized controlled trials. Therefore, it remains difficult to distinguish the specific effect of therapy itself from that of other factors, such as underlying expectations and receiving attention, which is especially important in trials on various disorders of the central nervous system.

Implementation of behavioural interventions might be particularly relevant in the care of headache patients with medication overuse headache (MOH). Medication overuse, the regular use of acute headache medication on at least 15 days per month in the case of simple analgesics or at least 10 days per month in the case of triptans, ergotamine, combination analgesics, opioids, or a combination of medication classes for > 3 months, aggravates and maintains chronic headache. Epidemiological data suggest that overuse of analgesics and other pain medication is common, as approximately 1% of the general population suffers from MOH. Medication overuse is a major risk factor for transformation from episodic migraine to chronic migraine (CM; i.e. headache on 15 or more days per month, of which at least 8 days fulfil migraine criteria). Withdrawal of the overused medication is an important step in medical care, with possibly added effect of preventive medication during the withdrawal process. Overuse of pain medication has a strong biobehavioural component, and withdrawal therapy in itself requires significant adjustments in behaviour and lifestyle. Furthermore, a brief intervention in primary care reduced medication overuse in MOH patients. As such, the addition of a behavioural and educational intervention during withdrawal therapy is likely beneficial, but has mostly been studied in observational trials. An open‐label study failed to prove superior effects of an educational programme relative to standard treatment among MOH patients after withdrawal, but found that patients perceived increased efficacy in the use of their coping strategies to control pain. We report a concealed double‐blinded randomized trial to study the efficacy of a behavioural intervention during acute medication withdrawal, with and without botulinum toxin A (BTX‐A), in MOH patients with underlying migraine using a new study design that ensures blinding.

### Risk factors for migraine disease progression: a narrative review for a patient-centered approach [^886787d5]. Journal of Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Medication overuse is a significant risk factor for migraine progression, not only for transforming from EM to CM, but also for developing MOH. Patients should be prescribed appropriate acute medication, but also should be educated on the risks of increased use. Expert opinion suggests limiting acute medication to < 10 days/month. In this way, patients will be mindful of their acute medication use and are more likely to notice an increased need for medication, a sign that they should consult with their healthcare provider. Patient education and building a communicative relationship can also be an effective tool in acute medication optimization.

Preventive treatments may reduce the risk of progression by preventing the occurrence of migraine attacks and reducing acute medication use. The INTREPID study was a randomized trial designed to test the hypothesis that topiramate prevented the transition from EM to CDH in persons with migraine and 9–14 monthly headache days. Although rates of transition to CDH were lower with topiramate treatment than with placebo, differences were not statistically significant, perhaps because the study was terminated prematurely due to loss of funding. There is good evidence that several preventive treatments can reduce MHDs and move patients from CM to EM, although evidence for preventing the transition from EM to CM is not robust. There is also good evidence that preventive treatments can reduce the need for acute medication use in patients with medication overuse or MOH; however, preventing the onset of either with preventive treatments has yet to be studied fully. Preventive medication can also improve overall acute medication optimization in patients, keeping in mind that it is important for patients to take preventive medication as prescribed. In addition to preventive medication, non-pharmacologic preventive options may work well for some patients.

Conclusions

MOH is a complex condition that is likely underdiagnosed and poorly managed in Australia. While withdrawal of the causative acute medication is the treatment of choice in MOH, this can be daunting for patients.

Recent evidence suggests that preventative treatment may help reduce non-compliance with withdrawal and potentially increase MOH remission rates and reversion to episodic migraine status. Coupled with multidisciplinary care, these strategies can help to support patient withdrawal from causative acute migraine medications.

### Assessing and managing medication overuse headache in Australian clinical practice [^fc10b3f5]. BMJ Neurology Open (2023). High credibility.

More than 3 million Australians are estimated to have migraine disorders, and over a quarter of a million Australians are estimated to have medication overuse headache (MOH). The personal, societal and economic burden of MOH is high. MOH impacts an individual's ability to work or study, care for family or themselves, culminating in poor quality of life. Accurate and timely diagnosis and treatment of MOH are imperative. Withdrawal failures and relapse rates are high in MOH.

Treatment of MOH is aimed at ceasing medication overuse and reducing monthly migraine days with the aim of achieving a pattern of well-controlled episodic migraine. Current treatment approaches in routine practice include withdrawal with preventive treatment, withdrawal with optional preventive treatment in the subsequent weeks and preventive treatment without withdrawal. This viewpoint article provides an overview of managing MOH in Australian clinical practice, with a focus on the importance of patient education and the role of preventive treatment in supporting patients as they withdraw from acute migraine medication(s).

Association between suicidal risks and medication-overuse headache in chronic migraine: a cross-sectional study

MOH involves elements of both chronic pain and substance misuse, both of which have been linked to suicide risk. This study aimed to test the association between MOH and suicidal ideation and/or attempt. A total of 603 consecutive patients newly diagnosed with chronic migraine in a specialist headache clinic (Taipei Veterans Hospital) were recruited, 320 with concomitant MOH and 283 without. Patients were aged between 20 and 65 (mean age 42.0 years) with a female:male ratio of 4:1, reflecting the gender distribution of chronic migraine.

There were significant associations between the presence of MOH and lower education levels and earlier onset of migraine, and more frequent analgesic use. However, MOH was not associated with a higher number of headache days per month nor the severity of depression, anxiety or poor sleep. In the study population, 214 (35.5%) had experienced suicidal ideation and 81 (13.4%) had made a suicide attempt at some point in their lives. Patients with chronic migraine and MOH were significantly more likely to have had suicidal ideation (41.6% vs 29.4%; p = 0.002) or made a previous suicide attempt (16.7% vs 10.1%; p = 0.018) than those with chronic migraine alone. The associations remained significant after controlling for demographics, headache profile, depression, anxiety, and sleep quality. Overall, the presence of MOH in chronic migraineurs was associated with increased risks of suicidal ideation (odds ratio 1.75, 95% CI 1.20–2.56) and suicide attempt (odds ratio 1.88, 95% CI 1.09–3.24).

Comment: In patients with chronic migraine, MOH is associated with greater suicidal risks. This study was well powered, took consecutive patients from a specialist centre to reduce selection bias, and controlled for a number of putative confounders. It was not designed to address whether MOH causes the increased suicide risks observed. The study did not take into account treatments being used for chronic migraine, the type or dosage of medication involved in the MOH, nor the presence or absence of substance misuse disorders, each of which is a potential source of variability or bias in the data.

### Chronic migraine [^7e4f2d8d]. BMJ (2014). Excellent credibility.

Chronic migraine is a disabling neurologic condition that affects 2% of the general population. Patients with chronic migraine have headaches on at least 15 days a month, with at least eight days a month on which their headaches and associated symptoms meet diagnostic criteria for migraine. Chronic migraine places an enormous burden on patients owing to frequent headaches; hypersensitivity to visual, auditory, and olfactory stimuli; nausea; and vomiting. It also affects society through direct and indirect medical costs. Chronic migraine typically develops after a slow increase in headache frequency over months to years. Several factors are associated with an increased risk of transforming to chronic migraine. The diagnosis requires a carefully performed patient interview and neurologic examination, sometimes combined with additional diagnostic tests, to differentiate chronic migraine from secondary headache disorders and other primary chronic headaches of long duration. Treatment takes a multifaceted approach that may include risk factor modification, avoidance of migraine triggers, drug and non-drug based prophylaxis, and abortive migraine treatment, the frequency of which is limited to avoid drug overuse. This article provides an overview of current knowledge regarding chronic migraine, including epidemiology, risk factors for its development, pathophysiology, diagnosis, management, and guidelines. The future of chronic migraine treatment and research is also discussed.

### Risk factors for migraine disease progression: a narrative review for a patient-centered approach [^744eb33b]. Journal of Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

This review aims to provide clinicians with information to identify migraine progression, knowledge of risk factors for migraine progression, and potential mitigation strategies supported by research and expert opinion. A proposed model of migraine disease progression is presented in Fig. 1. Increased migraine frequency and ineffective or suboptimal use of acute headache medication are major contributors to migraine disease progression. This supports the hypothesis that migraine progression is associated with risk factors and changes in pathophysiology in tandem. Therefore, it may be important to manage migraine carefully with a personalized, patient-centered approach including education, lifestyle enhancements, and optimized pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic therapies as appropriate to avoid new-onset progression or further disease progression.

Fig. 1
A model of migraine disease progression. *See Table 1

Key risk factors for migraine progression were categorized into 5 broad domains: migraine disease characteristics, treatment-related factors, comorbidities, lifestyle/exogenous factors, and demographic factors. Risk factors for migraine progression with a good level of evidence were numerous and included MHD frequency, suboptimal acute headache treatment, cutaneous allodynia, medication overuse, psychiatric symptoms, other chronic pain, metabolism-related comorbidities, sleep disturbances, respiratory conditions, former and current high caffeine intake, physical inactivity, tobacco use, and personal triggers as risk factors for migraine progression. Risk factors with moderate evidence include ≥ 5 MHDs (moderate risk) or ≥ 10 MHDs (high risk), persistent or frequent nausea, former head or neck injury, female sex, hormonal status, stress, poor nutrition, poor hydration, low level of education attainment, and poor sleep quality and duration. Further research is needed to develop a statistical model that weights risk factors predicting migraine disease progression; a model as such could be used to identify patients most at risk for progression and to guide prioritization of addressing risk factors to prevent or revert progression.

Actions that protect against migraine progression seldom appear in published literature and are therefore primarily based on expert opinion; however, there is ample literature suggesting that optimizing acute headache medication is effective at reducing progression risk. The implementation of interventions should be patient-centered and focus on interventions that are the most meaningful and feasible.

Knowledge of migraine disease progression, risk factors, and use of protective actions will allow clinicians to identify at-risk patients and to initiate interventions designed to minimize risk of progression.

### 2023 U.S. department of veterans affairs and U.S. department of defense clinical practice guideline for the management of headache [^65f1abf9]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Medication overuse headache (MOH) in patients with a preexisting headache condition can be diagnosed when they use non-opioid analgesic, opioid, or combination analgesic medications for the acute treatment of headache more than 10–15 days each month (dependent on the type of medication or medications used), and headache attributed to MOH occurs 15 or more days per month with overuse of one or more acute headache medications for more than 3 months. MOH is described as a frequently missed diagnosis when evaluating chronic headache disorders, and in the United States nearly one-quarter of people with chronic headaches take abortive medications daily. The association between butalbital containing compounds and developing MOH is highlighted along with the importance of not abruptly stopping these medications (because abrupt cessation can precipitate withdrawal seizures). MOH is noted as a condition that can be treated or even prevented with judicious and infrequent use of abortive pain medications and close communication and collaboration between patients and health care providers regarding the degree of headache control, appropriate use of headache preventive medications, and accurate assessment of the use of as-needed pain medication.

Lifestyle factors are also potentially modifiable risk factors for progression to chronic migraine, and it is particularly important to assess and counsel patients regarding acute medication overuse, defined as regular use of acute medications more than 10 or 15 days per month depending on medication class, which is described as highly disabling, prevalent, and prominently associated with a risk of migraine progressing to chronic migraine.

Medication overuse headache (International Classification of Headache Disorders, 3rd Edition [ICHD-3]) is diagnosed by headache on 15 or more days per month in a patient with a preexisting headache disorder, regular overuse for more than 3 months of acute/symptomatic headache medication, and no better ICHD-3 diagnosis. Medication-specific overuse thresholds are: butalbital overuse ≥ 5 days/month for > 3 months; opioid overuse ≥ 8 days/month for > 3 months; triptan overuse ≥ 10 days/month for > 3 months; ergotamine overuse ≥ 10 days/month for > 3 months; combination-analgesic overuse (any combination of classes, not to include combinations that include only non-opioid analgesics) ≥ 10 days/month for > 3 months; and non-opioid analgesic overuse (e.g., aspirin, NSAIDs, acetaminophen, steroids, and combinations of non-opioid analgesics) ≥ 15 days/month for > 3 months. The Work Group notes that for opioids and barbiturates, some population studies suggest lower thresholds, stating the frequency threshold is approximately 8 days of opioid use per month and 5 days of butalbital use per month, and it suggests that providers ask about use for non-headache indications as days per month are a total for any use of these medications; combination-analgesic refers to a headache abortive medication that contains more than one active ingredient.

### Assessing and managing medication overuse headache in Australian clinical practice [^1ae4a71d]. BMJ Neurology Open (2023). High credibility.

More than 3million Australians are estimated to have migraine disorders, and over a quarter of a million Australians are estimated to have medication overuse headache (MOH). The personal, societal and economic burden of MOH is high. MOH impacts an individual's ability to work or study, care for family or themselves, culminating in poor quality of life. Accurate and timely diagnosis and treatment of MOH are imperative. Withdrawal failures and relapse rates are high in MOH. Treatment of MOH is aimed at ceasing medication overuse and reducing monthly migraine days with the aim of achieving a pattern of well-controlled episodic migraine. Current treatment approaches in routine practice include withdrawal with preventive treatment, withdrawal with optional preventive treatment in the subsequent weeks and preventive treatment without withdrawal. This viewpoint article provides an overview of managing MOH in Australian clinical practice, with a focus on the importance of patient education and the role of preventive treatment in supporting patients as they withdraw from acute migraine medication(s).

### Guidelines of the international headache society for controlled trials of acute treatment of migraine attacks in adults: fourth edition [^63ec73c2]. Cephalalgia (2019). Medium credibility.

1.1.2. Other primary headaches

Recommendations:

1.1.2.1. Individuals satisfying criteria for chronic migraine or with a history of chronic migraine in the last 12 months should be excluded from pivotal efficacy trials for the acute treatment of migraine. In subsequent trials, exploration of the benefits of new acute treatments in subjects with chronic migraine is needed.

1.1.2.2. Subjects with other concomitant primary headache types (e.g. tension-type headache) are allowed if attacks are infrequent (i.e. present on an average of < 1 day/month and < 12 days/year) and can be differentiated from migraine based on the quality of pain and associated symptoms.

Comments:

Individuals with chronic migraine are excluded from the initial clinical trials of acute treatment because they may complicate analyses of efficacy in undifferentiated populations (refer to for guidance about trials evaluating preventive treatments in adults with chronic migraine). Subjects with migraine may have other primary headache types, including tension-type headache. Those experiencing primary headaches that cannot be distinguished from ICHD-defined migraine without aura should be excluded.

1.1.3. Secondary headaches

Recommendation:

Individuals with secondary headaches, including medication-overuse headache, should be excluded.

Comments:

Excessive use of acute medications for migraine does not necessarily lead to medication-overuse headache, and some individuals may fulfil IHS criteria for overuse of acute medications without suffering from a chronic pattern of headache. The secondary headache exclusion also applies to these subjects.

### Efficacy of atogepant in chronic migraine with and without acute medication overuse in the randomized, double-blind, phase 3 PROGRESS trial [^4a7bceaa]. Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic migraine (CM) is a debilitating neurologic disease characterized by ≥ 15 headache days per month, with ≥ 8 days meeting migraine criteria. The global prevalence of CM in the general population is estimated at 1.4%–2.2%. Patients with CM experience greater headache-related disability, lower health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and higher rates of comorbidities than those with episodic migraine (EM), who have < 15 headache days per month.

Acute treatments are used to address migraine symptoms and reduce disability; however, these treatments may be ineffective and may lead to an increase in dosing and the overuse of these medications. Acute medication overuse is defined as taking simple analgesics for ≥ 15 days per month or taking triptans, ergots, opioids, or combinations of medications for ≥ 10 days per month. Large longitudinal, cross-sectional studies estimate the prevalence of acute medication overuse in the migraine population at 15.4%–17.7%; however, studies from headache specialist centers estimate the prevalence as high as 50%–70%. Acute medication overuse is often linked with CM and associated with greater pain intensity and disability and worse 24-hour pain relief outcomes. Acute medication overuse is also a risk factor for the progression of EM to CM and for medication-overuse headache, a type of secondary headache in patients overusing acute headache medications with an underlying headache disorder. Patients with CM and medication-overuse headache have a significantly poorer quality of life and greater disability than those with CM without medication-overuse headache. Owing to the high prevalence of acute medication overuse in the migraine population and the increased disability, there is a need for more effective preventive treatments to reduce the use of symptomatic acute medication.

Atogepant is an oral, small-molecule, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonist specifically developed for the preventive treatment of migraine in adults. The phase 3 PROGRESS trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of atogepant for the preventive treatment of CM compared with placebo. Once daily, oral atogepant resulted in a significant decrease in mean monthly migraine days (MMDs) compared with placebo over 12 weeks (primary end point) in participants with CM. The primary research question addressed by this subgroup analysis of the PROGRESS trial was the efficacy and safety of atogepant compared with placebo in participants with CM with and without acute medication overuse.

Assessing MOH in clinical practice

Diagnosis of MOH is based on a detailed clinical history with meticulous attention to medication use and symptoms. Asking the relevant questions and recording the responses are key. The question guide in figure 1 has been developed by the authors as a practical tool to guide diagnostic discussions in practice.

Figure 1
Example of questions to assist with diagnosis of MOH. MOH, medication overuse headache.

The ICHD-3 describes MOH as headache occurring on 15 or more days/month in a patient with a pre-existing primary headache and developing as a consequence of regular overuse of acute or symptomatic headache medication (figure 2).

Management of MOH

Treatment of MOH involves several steps, all aimed at ceasing medication overuse and reducing MMDs to a pattern consistent with well-controlled episodic migraine (figure 3). Education is the key initial step to managing MOH and can be accomplished in both primary care and specialist settings. Patient education is integral to engaging and motivating patients to be proactive partners in their healthcare. Motivated individuals have the ability and commitment to self-manage migraines, engage in activities that can improve migraines and be involved in treatment decisions. While concerns remain that some patients may cease acute medications and 'suffer in silence', the potential for this can be minimised with education about the importance of open communication between the clinician and patient. Open and clear communication is imperative when educating about migraine and MOH. However, there is no 'one-size-fits-all' strategy, and communication must be individualised.

Figure 3
Treatment of MOH. MOH, medication overuse headache; NSAID, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug.

When approaching MOH education, clinicians should use a patient-centred approach.

Get to know an individual's level of understanding and engagement.
Use open-ended questions to explore beliefs or barriers that exist towards treatment.
Repeat education across multiple visits over the treatment course. It can be difficult for individuals to recall everything they have been told during a consultation.
Provide written materials and use audio-visual aids where possible.
Be non-judgemental and show empathy. This is imperative in establishing an open and honest patient–neurologist relationship.

Withdrawal of acute medication is the treatment of choice for MOH. However, this can be an anxious time for the affected individual. They are likely to be apprehensive and resistant to the idea of withdrawal. Reassuring individuals that they will be well supported throughout their withdrawal, including descriptions of what that support will look like, is important. Clinicians should schedule regular appointments with individuals undergoing withdrawal to follow progress and provide additional education and motivation to adhere to appropriate behaviours. Reassure patients that this follow-up is a means of support and not oversight.

Classification of headache disorders and MOH

Headache is a subjective symptom, and no laboratory tests or other objective tests are available to diagnose headache. Classification and diagnostic criteria are therefore of essential importance both in clinical practice and research settings. Until 1960, headache diagnoses and studies were based on nonuniform descriptions of symptomatology. Diagnostic criteria for headache were first presented in 1962 when an ad hoc committee of the National Institutes of Health published a first set of criteria. In 1988, the International Headache Society (IHS) published a classification system that became the standard for headache diagnosis: Classification and diagnostic criteria for headache disorders, cranial neuralgias and facial pain. In the 1988 edition, the diagnosis "headache induced by chronic substance use or exposure" was taken into the classification. In 2004, a second edition "The International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD-II)" was published, and the term "medication-overuse headache" was introduced. To be more applicable to patients in clinical practice, the diagnostic criteria for MOH were revised twice for the ICHD-II.–Before the last revision, MOH should paradoxically be entitled as "probable MOH" until overuse was discontinued, and then, if the patient improved after detoxification, given a definite MOH diagnosis. This meant that the patient could not receive a definite diagnosis of MOH until after a successful withdrawal of medication, following which she/he would no longer have MOH.

In 2013, a new version, "The International Classification of Headache Disorders 3rd beta edition (ICHD-IIIb)", was published, taking these changes to MOH into account.

According to the ICHD-IIIb, "MOH is headache occurring on 15 or more days per month developing as a consequence of regular overuse of acute or symptomatic headache medication (on 10 or more, or 15 or more days per month, depending on the medication) for more than 3 months. It usually, but not invariably, resolves after the overuse is stopped" (Figure 1). With the present criteria, MOH can be diagnosed immediately, and independently of withdrawal.

MOH is classified as a secondary chronic headache, but whether MOH is a primary or secondary headache is still under debate, and the concept of medication-overuse in other secondary headaches is unclear. Further, the concept of chronic migraine with medication-overuse is probably one of the most disputed aspects of the classification.

### Management of medication overuse headache: 1-year randomized multicentre open-label trial [^a266dc86]. Cephalalgia (2009). Low credibility.

It is a general belief that patients with medication overuse headache (MOH) need withdrawal of acute headache medication before they respond to prophylactic medication. In this 1-year open-labelled, multicentre study intention-to-treat analyses were performed on 56 patients with MOH. These were randomly assigned to receive prophylactic treatment from the start without detoxification, undergo a standard out-patient detoxification programme without prophylactic treatment from the start, or no specific treatment (5-month follow-up). The primary outcome measure, change in headache days per month, did not differ significantly between groups. However, the prophylaxis group had the greatest decrease in headache days compared with baseline, and also a significantly more pronounced reduction in total headache index (headache days/month x headache intensity x headache hours) at months 3 (P = 0.003) and 12 (P = 0.017) compared with the withdrawal group. At month 12, 53% of patients in the prophylaxis group had ≥ 50% reduction in monthly headache days compared with 25% in the withdrawal group (P = 0.081). Early introduction of preventive treatment without a previous detoxification programme reduced total headache suffering more effectively compared with abrupt withdrawal.

Medication-overuse headache — description, diagnostic criteria, and coding guidance are as follows: Headache occurring on 15 or more days/month in a patient with a pre-existing primary headache and developing as a consequence of regular overuse of acute or symptomatic headache medication (on 10 or more or 15 or more days/month, depending on the medication) for more than 3 months, and it usually, but not invariably, resolves after the overuse is stopped. Diagnostic criteria specify A. Headache occurring on ≥ 15-days/month in a patient with a pre-existing headache disorder; B. Regular overuse for > 3-months of one or more drugs that can be taken for acute and/or symptomatic treatment of headache; and C. Not better accounted for by another ICHD-3 diagnosis. Patients who meet criteria for both 1.3 Chronic migraine and 8.2 Medication-overuse headache should be given both diagnoses. Previously used terms include: Rebound headache, medication-misuse headache, drug-induced headache. Coding notes state patients should be coded for one or more subtypes of 8.2 Medication-overuse headache according to the specific medication(s) overused, with examples including receiving both 8.2.2 Triptan-overuse headache and a subform of 8.2.3 Non-opioid analgesic-overuse headache, except when combination-analgesic medications are overused, who are coded 8.2.5 Combination-analgesic-overuse headache and not according to each constituent; patients using multiple drugs without any single drug overused should be coded 8.2.6 Medication-overuse headache attributed to multiple drug classes not individually overused; and those clearly overusing multiple drugs but unable to specify names/quantities are coded 8.2.7 Medication-overuse headache attributed to unspecified or unverified overuse of multiple drug classes, and in almost all cases, this necessitates diary follow-up.

### Treatment of medication overuse headache – guideline of the EFNS headache panel [^f04ec02e]. European Journal of Neurology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Medication overuse headache is a common condition with a population-based prevalence of more than 1–2%. Treatment is based on education, withdrawal treatment (detoxification), and prophylactic treatment. It also includes management of withdrawal headache.

Aims

This guideline aims to give treatment recommendations for this headache.

Materials and Methods

Evaluation of the scientific literature.

Results

Abrupt withdrawal or tapering down of overused medication is recommended, the type of withdrawal therapy is probably not relevant for the outcome of the patient. However, inpatient withdrawal therapy is recommended for patients overusing opioids, benzodiazepine, or barbiturates. It is further recommended to start individualized prophylactic drug treatment at the first day of withdrawal therapy or even before. The only drug with moderate evidence for the prophylactic treatment in patients with chronic migraine and medication overuse is topiramate up to 200mg. Corticosteroids (at least 60mg prednisone or prednisolone) and amitriptyline (up to 50mg) are possibly effective in the treatment of withdrawal symptoms. Patients after withdrawal therapy should be followed up regularly to prevent relapse of medication overuse.

Discussion and Conclusion

Medication overuse headache can be treated according to evidence-based recommendations.

### Tackling chronic migraine: current perspectives [^761b47d0]. Journal of Pain Research (2014). Low credibility.

In the last decade, several diagnostic criteria and definitions have been proposed for chronic migraine (CM). The third edition of the International Classification of Headache Disorders-3 beta, published in 2013, has revised CM diagnostic criteria. CM is defined as "headache occurring on 15 or more days per month for more than 3 months, which has the features of migraine headache on at least 8 days per month". Patients who meet the criteria for CM and for medication-overuse headache should be given both diagnoses. Worldwide, CM prevalence ranges 1%-3%, and its incidence has been estimated to be 2.5% per year. CM is associated with disability and poor quality of life. Modifiable risk factors include (among others): migraine progression (defined as an increase in frequency and severity of migraine attacks); medication and caffeine overuse; obesity; stressful life events; and snoring. CM patients have a significantly higher frequency of some comorbid conditions, including chronic pain, psychiatric disorders, respiratory illness, and some vascular risk factors. Management includes identification and control of comorbidities and risk factors that predispose to CM; treatment and prevention for medication overuse; early treatment for migraine attacks; and an adequate preventive therapy for CM.

### Tackling chronic migraine: current perspectives [^8961f024]. Journal of Pain Research (2014). Low credibility.

In the last decade, several diagnostic criteria and definitions have been proposed for chronic migraine (CM). The third edition of the International Classification of Headache Disorders–3 beta, published in 2013, has revised CM diagnostic criteria. CM is defined as "headache occurring on 15 or more days per month for more than 3 months, which has the features of migraine headache on at least 8 days per month". Patients who meet the criteria for CM and for medication-overuse headache should be given both diagnoses. Worldwide, CM prevalence ranges 1%–3%, and its incidence has been estimated to be 2.5% per year. CM is associated with disability and poor quality of life. Modifiable risk factors include (among others): migraine progression (defined as an increase in frequency and severity of migraine attacks); medication and caffeine overuse; obesity; stressful life events; and snoring. CM patients have a significantly higher frequency of some comorbid conditions, including chronic pain, psychiatric disorders, respiratory illness, and some vascular risk factors. Management includes identification and control of comorbidities and risk factors that predispose to CM; treatment and prevention for medication overuse; early treatment for migraine attacks; and an adequate preventive therapy for CM. Several randomized controlled clinical trials have shown the efficacy of topiramate, amitriptyline, onabotulinumtoxinA, and cognitive-behavioral therapy in CM.

### Medication-overuse headache: a review [^626e356f]. Journal of Pain Research (2014). Low credibility.

Headache centers often report treatment success rates of around 70%. These results are commonly based on inpatient treatment, rescue medication, and continued support. However, the definition of success rate is based on very variable outcome measures and therefore difficult to compare.

Some studies have supported the effect of simple advice for MOH in the general population and in a headache clinic.–In a previous population-based study from Norway, simple information on medication use led to improvement, with 42% of patients reverting to episodic headache and 76% being free of medication-overuse after 1.5 years. The study was observational and lacked a control group, but the effect of simple information was supported by the fact that the participants had had MOH for 8–18 years prior to the interview during which the information was given. Two Italian studies in neurology settings reported that 78%–92% of patients with simple MOH and 60% of those with complicated MOH became free of chronic headache and medication-overuse 2 months after receiving simple advice. Even previously treatment-resistant MOH patients from a tertiary headache center experienced lasting improvement after withdrawal of medication. Based on our clinical experience, most patients overusing simple analgesics as well as codeine-containing combination analgesics and triptans manage abrupt withdrawal without tapering. Patients overusing heavier drugs with physical abstinence profiles may be a different matter and these patients may need other withdrawal strategies.

However, in most countries in Europe, simple analgesics, triptans, and combination analgesics clearly dominate. Because there seems to be no difference between inpatient and outpatient withdrawal, the less resource-demanding outpatient withdrawal is in our opinion the preferred method.,

Placebo-controlled studies of various prophylactic medications (adding prophylactic medication without initial withdrawal) in the treatment of MOH have found a significant reduction in migraine and headache days per month compared with placebo.–However, there are methodological concerns with these studies when addressing MOH, in particular based on the inclusion of a mixed population of chronic migraine with and without medication-overuse. However, these results do not seem to be superior to initial detoxification without prophylactic medication in other studies. Recent studies from headache centers have also used the combination of initial withdrawal and prophylactic medication with some superiority when compared with only initial withdrawal in the short-term; however, in the long-term results, there are no differences between the groups with or without prophylactic medication.

### Assessing and managing medication overuse headache in Australian clinical practice [^12a61037]. BMJ Neurology Open (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Medication overuse headache (MOH) is described in the latest International Classification of Headache Disorders third edition (ICHD-3) criteria as a secondary headache disorder that occurs as a consequence of the overuse of medication to alleviate symptoms of a primary headache disorder, such as chronic migraine or tension-type headache. Patients caught in this vicious cycle may experience increasing frequency and severity of headache despite taking increasing and excessive amounts of acute headache medication.

The pathophysiology of MOH is poorly understood. Central sensitisation is thought to play an important role given that patients with migraines or tension-type headache appear more prone to developing the secondary headache disorder.

Migraine is the leading cause of disability in Australia. According to 2019 estimates, more than 3.41 (3.995–2.931 IU) million Australians are affected by migraine, and with a global prevalence of 1%–2%, an estimated quarter of a million of these Australians have MOH.

For patients with MOH, withdrawal failures and relapse rates remain high, likely because patients often experience high rates of monthly migraine days (MMDs) despite medication withdrawal. Successful treatment may be further complicated by comorbidities of MOH, such as anxiety, depression and subclinical obsessive-compulsive disorders.

In Australia, real-world evidence demonstrates a high rate of opioid use in the treatment of acute migraine in the emergency setting. The popularity of self-medication with easily available over-the-counter analgesicsmay also contribute to the national burden of MOH.

Although MOH accounts for a large proportion of referrals to specialist headache clinics, the advent of newer, highly effective migraine-preventive medications may help general neurology practices better manage MOH.

This viewpoint article provides an overview of the assessment and management of MOH in Australia. For an in-depth discussion about MOH, the recent review from Dr Sun-Edelstein et al is recommended.

Chronic migraine — diagnostic notes state that characterization of frequently recurring headache generally requires a headache diary to record information on pain and associated symptoms day-by-day for at least one month; when criteria A-C are fulfilled by headache that is daily and unremitting from < 24 hours after its first onset, code as 4.10 New daily persistent headache, and when the manner of onset is not remembered or is otherwise uncertain, code as 1.3 Chronic migraine; the most common cause of symptoms suggestive of chronic migraine is medication overuse, and patients meeting criteria for 1.3 Chronic migraine and for 8.2 Medication-overuse headache should be coded for both, with around 50% of patients apparently with 1.3 Chronic migraine reverting to an episodic migraine type after drug withdrawal; because tension-type-like headache is within the diagnostic criteria for 1.3 Chronic migraine, the diagnosis excludes the diagnosis of 2. Tension-type headache or its types.

### Efficacy and safety of erenumab for nonopioid medication overuse headache in chronic migraine: a phase 4, randomized, placebo-controlled trial [^7a3c078f]. JAMA Neurology (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Patients with migraine commonly overuse acute medications, including simple and combination analgesics, triptans, and opioids. Medication overuse headache (MOH) is an International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD-3) recognized secondary headache disorder defined by sustained overuse of acute headache medication(s) with clinical observation of significant worsening of a pre-existing headache or development of a new type of headache in association with the medication overuse. According to the ICHD-3 criteria, MOH diagnosis is limited to patients with pre-existing primary headache disorders who have developed a chronic headache pattern (ie, 15 or more headache days per month for more than 3 months) due to sustained medication overuse.

Prevalence estimates of MOH in an adult Western population have been reported to be 1% to 2%. The most common presentation of MOH is in association with migraine. Chronic migraine (CM) associated with MOH (CM-MOH) has been linked to an increased risk of preventive treatment failure, stronger association with psychiatric comorbidities (eg, mood and/or substance-related disorders), increased migraine-related disability, higher levels of health care utilization, and overall decreased quality of life. An analysis from The Medication Overuse Treatment Strategy trial including over 600 participants from 34 sites found that CM-MOH is associated with substantial negative consequences and that depression symptom severity had the strongest relationship with pain interference and headache impact. In one observational study, patients with CM with high frequency medication use had significantly worse Headache Impact Test-6 (HIT-6) and Migraine Disability Assessment scores compared with patients with low-frequency medication use.MOH is the most costly of the primary and secondary headache disorders. In the European Union (EU), the Eurolight project using survey data from 2008 to 2009 estimated that the total annual cost of MOH among adults aged 18 to 65 years amounted to €37 billion ($40.1 billion.)

### Practical approach to a patient with chronic pain of uncertain etiology in primary care [^8a2c644d]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Assess current medication

All medications should be evaluated and discussed. This includes prescribed pharmacotherapy, over-the-counter medicines, alternative treatments, supplements and illicit/recreational drugs (including cannabis).

Analgesic consumption must be carefully evaluated. Frequent use of all types of pain-relieving drugs, in particular triptans, ergotamine, opioids, caffeine, meprobamate and codeine-containing products, may be associated with rebound headache, which itself is associated with greater pain-related disability. Withdrawal of treatment often leads to improvement and evolution to episodic headache. Where chronic headache does not resolve with withdrawal of analgesics, the patient should be referred for specialist assessment.

Opioids should be tapered and discontinued

Where patients who present with ongoing pain of uncertain etiology are already on long-term opioids, the dose should be carefully tapered and the opioid should preferably be discontinued. This includes combination analgesic formulations containing codeine and/or meprobamate, which are commonly used and may be available over-the-counter.

While careful tapering and discontinuation of opioids may take time, and both patients and health care professionals may be reluctant to withdraw any medication they perceive to be pain-relieving, in patients with chronic pain it is generally an essential step if pain is to be effectively managed. Opioid withdrawal itself can result in clinically meaningful pain relief.

The opioid dose should be reduced slowly by approximately 10% per week, or more slowly in patients who are anxious or who are suspected of being physically dependent on opioids. When one-third of the original dose is reached, reduce the rate of tapering to one half or less of the initial rate. With careful tapering, withdrawal symptoms in patients with chronic pain are less common and less severe than those which occur in people with opioid addiction and, if they do occur can usually be managed symptomatically. Where there is an increase in pain during tapering, dose reduction should be discontinued and consideration could be given to temporarily increasing the current dose before beginning the tapering process again. Buprenorphine substitution and clonidine may be helpful for more severe withdrawal symptoms and buprenorphine also for acute pain during opioid withdrawal.

Care must be taken to ensure that the patient is not lost to follow-up during the time taken for opioid withdrawal. Patients should be provided with written instructions, dates for follow-up consultations and encouraged to ask questions so that their concerns are addressed. Where a reasonable attempt to withdraw the opioid is not successful, the patient should be referred to a pain clinician.

### Guidelines of the international headache society for controlled trials of acute treatment of migraine attacks in adults: fourth edition [^c697eb1c]. Cephalalgia (2019). Medium credibility.

1.1.4. Frequency of attacks

Recommendations:

1.1.4.1. Attacks of migraine should occur two to eight times per month.

1.1.4.2. The frequency of other headaches (including non-target) must be no greater than 1 day per month.

1.1.4.3. There should be at least 48 hours of freedom from headache between attacks of migraine under study.

1.1.4.4. Subjects should experience fewer than 15 headache days per month.

Comments:

A minimum of two attacks per month is recommended. The maximum frequency of eight attacks per month reduces the probability that those with incipient medication overuse, medication-overuse headache, or chronic migraine will be included in the trial. Allowing 48 hours of freedom from headache between migraine attacks permits clear identification of individual attacks and distinction from relapse, and it avoids the use of multiple treatments for a single prolonged attack. The evaluation of three to five consecutive attacks provides information on consistency of response and may attenuate the placebo effect on the first attack (refer to Section 1.2.12 for more information about consistency of response).

1.1.5. Duration of migraine

Recommendation:

Migraine should be present for at least 1 year prior to inclusion in a clinical trial.

Comments:

Because there are no objective signs or biomarkers for the diagnosis of migraine, and the 1-year requirement increases the specificity of the diagnostic criteria, a minimum course of 1 year is advised to exclude people with headache types that may mimic migraine. The history may be based on subject recall or physician evaluation of medical records. At least five prior attacks of migraine without aura or two prior attacks of migraine with aura are required for diagnoses using ICHD criteria.

1.1.6. Age at onset

Recommendation:

The age at onset of migraine should be less than 50 years.

Comments:

Few adults will be excluded by this criterion, as migraine beginning after the age of 50 years is rare, and the prevalence of secondary headaches or organic diseases mimicking migraine increases after age 50. The inclusion of subjects with onset of migraine after 50 years of age can be considered in phase IV trials, as long as the migraine diagnosis is well established by ICHD criteria, and secondary headaches have been ruled out.

### Tackling chronic migraine: current perspectives [^878fac5b]. Journal of Pain Research (2014). Low credibility.

Management of chronic migraine

CM management is a complex issue that should include modification of risk factors, treatment of associated comorbidities, identification of medication overuse, treatment of acute migraine attacks, and preventive therapy. Adequate preventive medication use for those patients suffering EM should be started when progression occurs to prevent CM.

Early diagnosis of CM and the detection and identification of risk factors for chronification are essential. Training of primary care physicians and neurologists is needed as diagnostic criteria for CM have not yet been unanimously accepted in the past. Once CM is identified, physicians should be aware of the difficulties of treating CM. If medication overuse is identified, the withdrawal of analgesics, opioids, and caffeine should be advised.

Optimizing mood, reducing stress, practicing good sleep hygiene, and avoiding triggers are recommended to treat CM. Strategies should be started to treat risk factors and comorbid conditions including obesity, depression, high blood pressure, neck chronic pain, and sleep and mood disorders. Keeping a headache diary or calendar would give us clinical information regarding triggers, patterns of MOH, and the frequency of headache attacks. The role of migraine nurse specialists and psychologists should be integrated into preventive programs.

Preventive medication

Preventive medication for CM includes antiepileptic drugs (topiramate, sodium valproate), antidepressants (amitriptyline), and onabotulinumtoxinA (155–195 units). Treatment should be started with topiramate, perhaps the drug with the highest evidence to treat CM. OnabotulinumtoxinA could be considered when at least two consecutive trials of other preventive drugs have failed. Compliance needs to be assessed, as many CM patients may fail to take preventive medication. Observational studies and pooled data from randomized trials have demonstrated poor adherence to migraine prophylaxis.
