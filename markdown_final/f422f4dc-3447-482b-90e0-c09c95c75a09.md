## Question

How is lymphoma or chronic lymphocytic leukemia diagnosed?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) are diagnosed. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to structure the CLL diagnostic pathway from suspicion through confirmation and prognostic workup. Then, I should lay out the lymphoma pathway with emphasis on tissue diagnosis and staging. Next, I will integrate special scenarios like distinguishing SLL from CLL and recognizing Richter transformation. Finally, I will review differential diagnoses, MRD assessment, and quality assurance, while continuously checking each assertion against guideline-level references.

> Let me first confirm the clinical triggers for evaluation in suspected CLL or lymphoma, because I need to ensure we start from a realistic presentation and avoid anchoring bias early. Older adults with marked leukocytosis and organomegaly raise suspicion for CLL, while lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, B-symptoms, or cytopenias should prompt exam, CBC with differential, and a smear, but I should be careful to exclude infection or inflammation as common causes of leukocytosis before labeling a lymphoproliferative disorder as the cause [^115FEDF8] [^1113Q9nd] [^115wFVNq].

> I will now examine the core diagnostic criterion for CLL, and I need to verify that the threshold and duration are correctly stated. CLL requires at least 5×10⁹ clonal B-lymphocytes per liter in the peripheral blood sustained for at least 3 months with flow cytometric confirmation of clonality and a characteristic immunophenotype, and on smear I expect small mature lymphocytes with smudge cells, while counts below 5×10⁹/L without adenopathy or cytopenias favor monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (MBL), which progresses to CLL at about 1–2% per year in high-count cases [^114CN7bG] [^1157XCQM] [^115wFVNq] [^1122hLbC].

> Hold on, I should verify the immunophenotypic signature that locks in the CLL diagnosis, because mantle cell lymphoma can confound CD5-positive B-cell results. The harmonized core panel is CD19, CD5, CD20, CD23 with kappa/lambda light chain restriction, typically with dim surface Ig, dim CD20, and low CD79b; in borderline cases I should add CD43, CD79b, CD81, CD200, CD10, or ROR1, and I must remember that MCL is often CD23 negative and cyclin D1 positive, so I should not jump to conclusions based on CD5 alone [^1157XCQM].

> Next, I should distinguish CLL from small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), and I need to ensure I apply the correct cutoffs and tissue requirement. CLL is defined by the blood threshold of clonal B-cells at or above 5×10⁹/L, whereas SLL has lymphadenopathy with fewer than 5×10⁹/L circulating B-cells and no cytopenias from marrow infiltrate, and critically, SLL should be confirmed by lymph node histopathology rather than blood immunophenotyping alone [^1157XCQM].

> Wait, let me verify when a bone marrow examination is warranted, since it is not required for a straightforward CLL diagnosis. Bone marrow evaluation is appropriate for inconclusive immunophenotyping, for investigating cytopenias to differentiate autoimmune etiology from marrow infiltration, as a baseline before therapy in selected cases, and for treatment response assessment in some settings, but it is not mandatory for typical CLL diagnosis [^117TEzxd] [^117EEvh1].

> I need to check the timing and scope of genetic and molecular testing because these results materially change therapy. Before each line of treatment, I should obtain FISH for del(17p) and sequence TP53 even when 17p deletion is absent, given clonal evolution; I should also determine IGHV mutational status for risk stratification, and incorporate serum β-2 microglobulin as part of prognostication, acknowledging that these results drive selection and sequencing of targeted agents [^116TSXJf] [^116HJE2M] [^1157XCQM] [^117QeUzF].

> Let me think about the pretreatment baseline workup and what I must not overlook. I should confirm a full laboratory profile including CBC with differential, renal and hepatic chemistries, LDH, haptoglobin, β-2 microglobulin, immunoglobulins, and a direct antiglobulin test, and screen for HIV, HBV, HCV, and CMV; in terms of imaging, chest imaging or CT is reasonable prior to therapy in symptomatic or advanced disease, whereas routine imaging during watch-and-wait should be avoided; meticulous physical examination with bidimensional node measurements and liver/spleen palpation is essential at baseline and prior to treatment [^116eypb9] [^115RGWCp] [^1168vQ5S] [^114zYbf7] [^113EYC3u] [^113WsP4Z] [^1117Wsjj].

> Now, shifting to lymphoma broadly, I should confirm that the non-negotiable first step is a tissue diagnosis, because peripheral blood alone is insufficient except in leukemic presentations. Excisional or incisional lymph node biopsy is preferred for histopathology, and the final diagnosis integrates clinical context with morphology, immunophenotype, genetics, and molecular features per WHO classification frameworks, which I should use to avoid misclassification [^116j3fB4].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought "smear assessment" is critical for distinguishing lymphoma subtypes and grading, but I should correct that and be precise: for nodal and extranodal lymphomas, the decisive information comes from architecture and cytology on formalin-fixed tissue with appropriate immunohistochemical panels, while touch imprints or cytology can be adjuncts, not substitutes; for concrete examples, classical Hodgkin lymphoma is defined by H/RS cells expressing CD30 and CD15 with weak PAX5 and lacking CD45, and nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma has LP cells with a distinct phenotype, so I must tailor the panel to morphology [^115Lqd5B] [^112b5YBh] [^116j3fB4].

> I should double-check the role of cytogenetic and molecular tests in lymphoma classification and prognosis. Conventional karyotyping and FISH assays identify hallmark translocations, such as t(14;18)(q32; q21) in follicular lymphoma, which I should not mistakenly equate with CLL even though rare t(14;18) events have been reported in CLL, and next-generation sequencing can further refine classification and identify therapeutic targets where relevant [^116j3fB4] [^111WEERM].

> Next, I should review staging and disease burden assessment for lymphoma and ensure I apply imaging judiciously. CT of the neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis establishes nodal distribution, PET-CT is standard for staging and response in FDG-avid entities like DLBCL and classical Hodgkin lymphoma, bone marrow biopsy assesses marrow involvement when it affects stage or management, and I should consider CSF evaluation in high-risk scenarios for CNS spread, recognizing that imaging and response criteria must be applied consistently across timepoints [^116j3fB4] [^113RR729].

> I will now examine Richter transformation, and I need to ensure the confirmatory pathway is explicit. In a patient with CLL who develops rapidly enlarging nodes, new B-symptoms, and rising LDH, I should promptly obtain a new excisional or core biopsy to document transformation, assess clonal relatedness to the antecedent CLL, and then tailor therapy accordingly, treating clonally unrelated DLBCL as de novo DLBCL and considering advanced modalities, including CAR-T, for clonally related transformations or Hodgkin-variant cases per guideline recommendations [^113gggar] [^111xztzE] [^111EYsNK] [^114LioLX].

> Hold on, let me reconsider the key differential diagnoses so I do not miss mimics that alter management. Reactive lymphocytosis from infection or inflammation can elevate counts without clonality, mantle cell lymphoma can mimic CLL with CD5 expression but usually lacks CD23 and expresses cyclin D1, and hairy cell leukemia has a distinctive immunophenotype and morphology, so I should use flow cytometry and ancillary markers to avoid misclassification, especially when clinical features are atypical for CLL [^1113Q9nd] [^1157XCQM].

> Next, I should review measurable residual disease (MRD) in CLL and verify the practical implications. High-sensitivity flow cytometry and IGH-based molecular assays provide complementary MRD detection, with flow typically reaching 10⁻⁴ and molecular methods up to 10⁻⁶, and MRD negativity correlates with improved progression-free outcomes and is increasingly used in trials to inform time-limited therapy strategies and depth-of-response assessments [^117EEvh1] [^114gXs2P].

> I need to ensure quality assurance and standardization are built into this pathway, because diagnostic accuracy depends on processes as much as individual tests. Adhering to iwCLL and ESMO guidance and WHO classification, performing cytogenomic testing in accredited laboratories with hematologic expertise, and integrating findings through multidisciplinary review across hematopathology, flow cytometry, cytogenomics, and clinical hematology are necessary steps to produce a reliable, reproducible final diagnosis [^112MV34Z] [^116j3fB4] [^1178Zr5B] [^1156NHts].

> To synthesize a decision path without oversimplifying, I should confirm peripheral blood B-cell counts and phenotype first to classify CLL versus MBL, proceed to lymph node biopsy if nodes are present with subthreshold circulating B-cells to diagnose SLL, reserve tissue biopsy as the cornerstone for non-CLL lymphomas, and re-biopsy any CLL with clinical acceleration to exclude Richter transformation, all while anchoring workup and prognostic testing to iwCLL and ESMO standards and avoiding unnecessary imaging during observation phases [^114CN7bG] [^1157XCQM] [^116j3fB4] [^113EYC3u].

## Clinical evaluation

### History and physical examination

History should document **B symptoms** (fever, night sweats, weight loss), fatigue, infections, and autoimmune phenomena [^1117ubjx] [^113WsP4Z], while the **physical exam** should include palpation of cervical, axillary, and inguinal nodes; assessment of spleen and liver size; and recording bidimensional node measurements and organ dimensions below the costal margins [^1117Wsjj].

---

## Laboratory investigations

### Complete blood count (CBC) and peripheral blood smear

In the CBC and peripheral blood smear, the **CBC** evaluates lymphocytosis, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and neutropenia [^116eypb9], and the **smear** identifies smudge cells and atypical lymphocytes [^115wFVNq].

---

### Immunophenotyping by flow cytometry

By flow cytometry, **CLL diagnosis** requires persistent ≥ 5×10⁹/L clonal B-lymphocytes for ≥ 3 months [^114CN7bG] with a characteristic phenotype (CD19, CD20, CD23, CD5, low surface Ig, kappa/lambda restriction) [^111K1Le6] [^1157XCQM], while in **lymphoma** immunophenotyping distinguishes subtypes [^116j3fB4].

---

### Cytogenetic and molecular testing

- **FISH**: Detect del(17p), del(11q), trisomy 12, del(13q).
- **TP53 sequencing**: Test exons 4–10 (or 2–11) before therapy [^116TSXJf].

Additional laboratory tests include **serum chemistry** (LDH, bilirubin, immunoglobulins, direct antiglobulin test, haptoglobin, and liver and kidney function) [^115RGWCp] [^116eypb9]; **β-2-microglobulin** serves as a prognostic marker [^117QeUzF].

---

## Imaging studies

Imaging includes **CT** of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis for staging and organ involvement [^1168vQ5S], and **PET-CT** to evaluate metabolic activity, guide biopsy, and assess transformation. If CT is not performed, a baseline chest X-ray may be obtained [^114zYbf7].

---

## Tissue biopsy and histopathological examination

- **Excisional biopsy**: Gold standard for lymphoma; assess architecture and cell morphology [^116j3fB4].
- **Immunohistochemistry**: Define subtype and proliferation index (Ki-67) [^112HoDMD].
- **Bone marrow biopsy**: For unclear cytopenias or non-conclusive phenotypes [^112S7NqJ] [^117TEzxd].

---

## Diagnostic criteria and classification systems

**CLL** is defined by ≥ 5×10⁹/L clonal B-lymphocytes for ≥ 3 months [^114CN7bG] with a characteristic immunophenotype [^111K1Le6], while **lymphoma** is categorized by the WHO classification integrating morphology, immunophenotype, genetics, and clinical features [^116j3fB4].

---

## Differential diagnosis

The differential diagnosis includes **infections** such as EBV, CMV, HIV, and hepatitis B/C, and **autoimmune disorders** such as systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis. Other hematologic malignancies to consider include hairy cell leukemia, mantle cell lymphoma, and prolymphocytic leukemia [^1113Q9nd].

---

## Prognostic markers and risk stratification

### Chronic lymphocytic leukemia: 2025 update on the epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and therapy [^1157XCQM]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). High credibility.

Monoclonal B lymphocytosis is defined by the presence of fewer than 5000 B-lymphocytes per μL of blood in the absence of lymphadenopathy, organomegaly (as determined by physical examination or CT scans), cytopenias, or disease-related symptoms. The presence of cytopenia caused by a typical marrow infiltrate confirms the diagnosis of CLL, regardless of the number of peripheral blood B-lymphocytes or lymph node involvement. MBL progresses to frank CLL at a rate of 1%–2% per year.

The definition of SLL requires lymphadenopathy and the absence of cytopenias due to a clonal marrow infiltrate. Additionally, the number of B-lymphocytes in the peripheral blood should not exceed 5000/μL. The diagnosis should ideally be confirmed by histopathological evaluation of a lymph node biopsy.

- **Immunophenotyping**: CLL cells co-express the surface antigen CD5, along with B-cell antigens CD19, CD20, and CD23. The levels of surface immunoglobulin, CD20, and CD79b are typically low in comparison to those in normal B cells. Each leukemia cell clone is restricted to expressing either kappa or lambda immunoglobulin light chains. CD5 expression can also be observed in other lymphoid malignancies, such as mantle cell lymphoma. A recent, large harmonization effort has confirmed that a panel including CD19, CD5, CD20, CD23, kappa, and lambda is often sufficient to establish the diagnosis. In borderline cases, additional markers such as CD43, CD79b, CD81, CD200, CD10, or ROR1 may aid in refining the diagnosis.

### Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia [^117VXsqv]. Lancet (2008). Low credibility.

Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia is the most common form of leukaemia in Europe and North America, primarily affecting older individuals, although it is not exclusive to this demographic. The disease has a highly variable course, with survival ranging from months to decades. Significant progress has been made in identifying molecular and cellular markers that could predict disease progression in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. In particular, the mutational profile of immunoglobulin genes and certain cytogenetic abnormalities are important predictors of prognosis. However, these advances have raised new questions about the biology, prognosis, and management of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia.

- **B-cell receptor function and genetic lesions**: A better understanding of the function of the B-cell receptor, the nature of genetic lesions, and the balance between proliferation and apoptosis has improved our ability to assess prognosis and manage chronic lymphocytic leukaemia.

Available treatments generally induce remission; however, nearly all patients experience relapse, and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia remains an incurable disease. Advances in molecular biology have enhanced our understanding of the disease's pathophysiology. Together with the development of new therapeutic agents, these advancements have made the management of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia more rational and effective than before. Unfortunately, there is currently no known method to prevent chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. Early detection is widely practiced, but it appears to make no difference to the patient's eventual outcome.

### Global burden of hematologic malignancies and evolution patterns over the past 30 years [^116VGkEf]. Blood Cancer Journal (2023). Low credibility.

During the past study period, advances in laboratory techniques have had a significant impact on the diagnosis and management of hematologic malignancies. With the development of new technologies, such as next-generation sequencing, flow cytometry, and molecular genetics, it is now possible to identify specific genetic mutations and biomarkers that can be used to classify and prognosticate hematologic malignancies. This 30-year time series shows significant hematologic malignancies and specific temporal features, and below we consider possible contributing factors to changes in morbidity and mortality. Changes in diagnostic criteria or definitions have a certain impact on the increase or decrease of incidence (Fig. 1C).

For example, before 1999, the diagnosis of CML was based on clinical features and the presence of the Philadelphia chromosome. The discovery of the BCR-ABL1 fusion gene provided a more specific diagnostic marker for CML. More cases previously classified as leukemia solely based on morphological diagnosis were excluded without immunophenotypic typing and genetic testing. The new criteria require confirmation of the diagnosis with specific biomarkers. For example, cytoplasmic CD3 or TdT for T-cell ALL, and cytoplasmic CD10 or CD19 for B-cell ALL. This makes the diagnosis of ALL more accurate and specific, reducing the inclusion of cases with overlapping features, such as Burkitt's lymphoma previously classified as ALL. In 2008, the WHO introduced the concept of genetic abnormalities as the main diagnostic criteria, leading to the emergence of new subtypes.

The management of B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) has become increasingly complex for practicing hematologists. Rapid advances in diagnostic precision, methods of predicting prognosis, understanding the natural history of CLL, recognition of clinical complications, and clarification of quality of life (QOL) issues have significantly influenced patient care. Furthermore, the emergence of novel treatment approaches makes the care of CLL patients more demanding. This review aims to summarize these advances and provide a framework for integrating this knowledge into routine hematologic practice.

### New insights into the diagnosis of lymphomas [^116j3fB4]. Annals of Oncology (2012). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of lymphoid neoplasias is based on the criteria of the World Health Organization (WHO) classification. This framework is built on two major principles: the stratification of neoplasms according to their derivation from precursor or mature cells and the definition of clinically relevant non-overlapping diseases. The diagnosis is established by integrating the clinical, morphological, phenotypic, genetic, and molecular characteristics of the tumors. This approach is reproducible, clinically relevant, and scientifically sound.

The elucidation of the human genome a decade ago and the development of high-throughput technologies have opened the possibility to search for comprehensive views of the genomic alterations of the tumors that are starting to influence our approach to diagnosis. The new generation of sequencing technologies and their systematic application to human cancer, particularly to lymphoid neoplasms, are revealing a landscape of somatic mutations of unprecedented complexity. These studies have already provided a number of important findings with functional and clinical implications. The translation of all this knowledge into the clinic is challenging and offers relevant perspectives.

### Chronic lymphocytic leukemia: 2025 update on the epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and therapy [^115bqomp]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). Low credibility.

Ibrutinib is an orally active, small-molecule BTK inhibitor that induces apoptosis in B-cell lymphomas and CLL cells. In one of the first trials, 56 patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell lymphoma and CLL received escalating oral doses of ibrutinib, with two schedules: one involving 28 days on, 7 days off, and the other a once-daily continuous dosing. The overall response rate (ORR) in 50 evaluable patients was 60%, including a 16% complete response (CR). The median progression-free survival (PFS) in all patients was 13.6 months. The most relevant treatment-related side effects were viral infections.

In a study of 85 patients with relapsed or refractory CLL or SLL, ibrutinib showed promising results. Patients experienced mostly Grade 1 or 2 side effects such as transient diarrhea, fatigue, and upper respiratory tract infection. The overall response rate was 71%, with additional patients showing partial responses with lymphocytosis. The estimated PFS rate at 26 months was 75%, and the overall survival (OS) rate was 83%. These results indicate that ibrutinib can provide durable remissions in CLL/SLL patients with relapsed, refractory, or high-risk disease.

### Resistance to targeted therapies in chronic lymphocytic leukemia: Current status and perspectives for clinical and diagnostic practice [^114UStPi]. Leukemia (2025). High credibility.

Targeted therapies using BTK inhibitors (BTKi) and BCL2 inhibitors (BCL2i) represent a paradigm shift in the management of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and have led to significant improvements in patient outcomes. Despite their efficacy, resistance to these targeted therapies may occur, resulting in treatment failure and disease progression for a significant proportion of patients. The specific resistance mechanisms observed and the timing of their onset show significant variation and are the result of an interplay of many factors including intrinsic disease characteristics, exposure to previous therapies, and duration of exposure to the targeted agent (i.e. continuous versus time-limited therapy).

Understanding mechanisms of resistance to targeted agents may be highly informative for tailoring treatment both at the individual patient level as well as for clinical trials. Moreover, research into resistance mechanisms can impart crucial insights into disease and drug biology, which may, in turn, inform the development of future therapeutic agents and approaches. In addition, diagnostic testing for genomic variants associated with resistance is becoming an increasingly common part of routine clinical practice. Herein, we summarize the landscape of resistance mechanisms observed during targeted treatment of CLL and their relevance for clinical practice. We also provide a practical perspective on the approaches for the detection and interpretation of genomic alterations in the diagnostic laboratory that may help standardize practice.

### Measurable residual disease in chronic lymphocytic leukemia: Expert review and consensus recommendations [^117EEvh1]. Leukemia (2021). Low credibility.

Optimal method of response assessment in CLL: Although clinical response and measurable residual disease (MRD) are correlated, each independently prognosticates outcome. With chemoimmunotherapy (CIT), MRD is more strongly prognostic than clinical response for progression-free survival (PFS). Clinical response varies in significance, depending on MRD status.

- **Consensus recommendations**: In clinical practice, the optimal response assessment method depends on individual patient status, type of treatment, and treatment goals. At a minimum, response assessment should include a full blood count and clinical examination. Bone marrow examination and CT scan may also be included. In clinical trials, bone marrow examination and CT scan should be assessed, and MRD assessment is recommended to inform prognosis, quality of response, and to potentially identify candidates for MRD-driven changes in treatment duration.

The previous edition of the consensus guidelines of the International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (iwCLL), published in 2008, has been broadly accepted by physicians and investigators caring for patients with CLL. Recent advances, including the discovery of the genomic landscape of the disease, the development of genetic tests with prognostic relevance, and the detection of minimal residual disease (MRD), have prompted an international panel to provide updated evidence- and expert opinion-based recommendations. These recommendations include a revised version of the iwCLL response criteria, an update on the use of MRD status for clinical evaluation, and recommendations regarding the assessment and prophylaxis of viral diseases during CLL management.

### Prognostic models for newly-diagnosed chronic lymphocytic leukaemia in adults: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^114QKa6F]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Low credibility.

Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is the most common cancer of the lymphatic system in Western countries. Several clinical and biological factors for CLL have been identified; however, it remains unclear which of the available prognostic models combining those factors can be used in clinical practice to predict long-term outcomes in people newly diagnosed with CLL.

- **Objectives**: To identify, describe, and appraise all prognostic models developed to predict overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), or treatment-free survival (TFS) in newly diagnosed (previously untreated) adults with CLL, and to meta-analyse their predictive performances.

- **Search methods**: We searched MEDLINE (from January 1950 to June 2019 via Ovid), Embase (from 1974 to June 2019), and registries of ongoing trials (to 5 March 2020) for development and validation studies of prognostic models for untreated adults with CLL. In addition, we screened the reference lists and citation indices of included studies.

- **Selection criteria**: We included all prognostic models developed for CLL that predict OS, PFS, or TFS, provided they combined prognostic factors known before treatment initiation, and any studies that tested the performance of these models in individuals other than the ones included in model development (i.e. 'external model validation studies'). We included studies of adults with confirmed B-cell CLL who had not received treatment prior to the start of the study. We did not restrict the search based on study design.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We developed a data extraction form to systematically collect relevant data from the studies.

**Venetoclax and ibrutinib**: The CLARITY trial tested a combination of ibrutinib with venetoclax in patients with relapsed or refractory CLL. The primary endpoint was eradication of minimal residual disease (MRD) after 12 months of combined therapy. After 12 months of ibrutinib plus venetoclax, MRD negativity was achieved in the blood of 28 out of 53 patients (53%) and in the marrow of 19 patients (36%). Forty-seven patients (89%) responded, and 27 (51%) achieved a complete remission. After a median follow-up of 21.1 months, one patient progressed, and all patients were alive. A single case of biochemical tumor lysis syndrome was observed. Other adverse effects were mild or manageable and most commonly were neutropenia or gastrointestinal events.

### Response assessment criteria and their applications in lymphoma: Part 1 [^113RR729]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

The effectiveness of cancer therapy, both in individual patients and across populations, requires a systematic and reproducible method for evaluating response to treatment. Early efforts to meet this need resulted in the creation of numerous guidelines for quantifying post-therapy changes in disease extent, both anatomically and metabolically. Over the past few years, criteria for disease response classification have been developed for specific cancer histologies. At the time of writing, the spectrum of disease broadly referred to as lymphoma is perhaps the most common for which disease response classification is used. This review article provides an overview of the existing response assessment criteria for lymphoma and highlights their respective methodologies and validities. Concerns over the technical complexity and arbitrary thresholds of many of these criteria, which have impeded the long-standing endeavor of standardizing response assessment, are also discussed.

### High-risk subtypes of chronic lymphocytic leukemia are detectable as early as 16 years prior to diagnosis [^116Lq4wT]. Blood (2022). High credibility.

For 56 participants, lymphocyte counts were recorded at the time of baseline blood sampling (Figure 1D). Lymphocytosis, defined as greater than 3 × 10⁹ lymphocytes per liter of blood, was evident in 10 of 28 patients up to 8 years before the chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) diagnosis, suggesting undiagnosed instances of high-count monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (HC MBL) or asymptomatic CLL. In contrast, next-generation sequencing results showed detectable skewing of the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGH) gene repertoire in 21 of 28 patients up to 15 years before CLL diagnosis, often in the absence of elevated lymphocyte counts (Figure 1E-F). Selection mechanisms may operate long before lymphocyte counts become abnormal, leading to restriction of the IGH gene repertoire and clonal expansion. Remarkably, some patients with CLL requiring treatment and clinical transformation to an aggressive B-cell lymphoma displayed considerable skewing in the IGH gene repertoire as early as 16 years before CLL diagnosis (Figure 1G-H).

We determined the immunoglobulin heavy variable (IGHV) mutational status for all 100 future patients with CLL with a dominant clonotype frequency greater than 2% (Figure 2A). We observed 68 mutated and 32 unmutated dominant clonotypes, in accordance with previous reports of an IGHV mutational status ratio of 2:1 in monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (MBL). Regardless of the association of unmutated CLL (U-CLL) with a poorer prognosis, there was no significant difference in the time to diagnosis between mutated CLL (M-CLL) and U-CLL. However, patients with a prediagnostic IGHV-unmutated dominant clonotype had a significantly shorter overall survival after CLL diagnosis compared with patients with an IGHV-mutated clonotype (supplemental Figure 2).

Regarding screening and diagnosis for acute lymphoblastic leukemia, the NCCN 2024 guidelines recommend establishing the diagnosis by demonstrating ≥ 20% bone marrow lymphoblasts on hematopathology review of bone marrow aspirate and biopsy materials. This includes the following:

- **Morphologic assessment**: Wright-Giemsa-stained bone marrow aspirate smears and H&E-stained core biopsy and clot sections.

- **Comprehensive flow cytometric immunophenotyping**: It is noted that CD10 negativity correlates with KMT2A rearrangement, whereas CD20 positivity is variably defined, with most studies using > 20% of blasts expressing CD20.

- **Baseline flow cytometric and/or molecular characterization**: This characterization of the leukemic clone facilitates subsequent minimal/measurable residual disease analysis.

- **Karyotyping**: G-banded metaphase chromosomes.

### Prediagnostic transcriptomic markers of chronic lymphocytic leukemia reveal perturbations 10 years before diagnosis [^114wWwhn]. Annals of Oncology (2014). Low credibility.

B-cell lymphomas represent a diverse group of hematological neoplasms with varying etiologies and clinical trajectories. Increased insights into their etiology and the discovery of prediagnostic markers have the potential to improve the clinical course of these neoplasms.

- **Methods**: We investigated, in a prospective study, global gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of 263 incident B-cell lymphoma cases. These cases were diagnosed between 1 and 17 years after blood sample collection, and were compared against 439 controls, nested within two European cohorts.

- **Results**: Our analyses identified transcriptomic markers specific to certain lymphoma subtypes. Few markers were found for multiple myeloma (N = 3), and 745 differentially expressed genes were associated with future risk of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). The strongest associations consistently occurred in both cohorts, relating to (B-) cell signaling networks and immune system regulation pathways. CLL markers demonstrated significant predictive abilities of disease onset, even in cases diagnosed more than 10 years post-blood collection.

- **Conclusions**: This study is the first to investigate global gene expression in blood cells concerning future risk of B-cell lymphomas. We primarily identified genes associated with future CLL risk, involved in biological pathways mechanistically linked to CLL pathogenesis. Many but not all of the top findings have been previously reported in studies based on tumor tissues, suggesting a mixture of preclinical and early disease markers can be detected several years before diagnosis.

### Chronic lymphocytic leukemia treatment algorithm 2018 [^115wFVNq]. Blood Cancer Journal (2018). High credibility.

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) can be associated with a variety of symptoms and conditions. These include anemia, lymphadenopathy, and hypogammaglobulinemia, as well as the presence of smudge cells. Patients may also present with autoimmune hemolytic anemia, leukemia cutis, fever, and hepatomegaly. Additional manifestations can include skin wounds, night sweats, and weight loss.

The disease is often seen in elderly patients and may present with skin nodules, axillary lymphadenopathy, and increased blood lymphocyte counts. Other associated conditions are increased serum β-2 microglobulin, skin papules, fatigue, skin plaques, and decreased platelet counts. There may also be splenomegaly, supraclavicular lymphadenopathy, increased serum LDH, cervical lymphadenopathy, and immune thrombocytopenia. Elevated serum transaminases can also be a feature of CLL.

### Chronic lymphocytic leukemia: 2025 update on the epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and therapy [^117VRqUG]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). High credibility.

Finally, despite the tremendous progress in our understanding and treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), new challenges are emerging. As the majority of patients treated with targeted agents are not cured, disease relapses will eventually occur after exposure to BTK, PI3K, or BCL2 inhibitors. In particular, salvage options for disease that is refractory to BTK and BCL2 inhibitors are limited, and the outcome of patients with double‐refractory disease is quite poor. For this group of patients, alternative therapeutic concepts are needed.

In any case, the management of CLL will continue to undergo very dynamic development. Therefore, we must continue to work toward the long‐term control of this disease by including our patients in clinical trials. Moreover, in such a fast‐developing era of medicine, bi‐annually updated recommendations offer the possibility to constantly monitor and summarize the clinically relevant progress in CLL management.

Standardized criteria for diagnosis and response assessment are needed to interpret and compare clinical trials and for the approval of new therapeutic agents by regulatory agencies. Therefore, a National Cancer Institute-sponsored Working Group (NCI-WG) on chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) published guidelines for the design and conduct of clinical trials for patients with CLL in 1988, which were updated in 1996.

During the past decade, considerable progress has been achieved in defining new prognostic markers, diagnostic parameters, and treatment options. This prompted the International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (iWCLL) to provide updated recommendations for the management of CLL in clinical trials and general practice.

### Best practice no 185. Cytological and molecular diagnosis of lymphoma [^112HoDMD]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2005). Low credibility.

With the advances in molecular pathology, the cell as a morphological and functional unit has become essential in the diagnosis of lymphoma. Conventional staining, preparation, and interpretation of cells, as seen in fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC), often used as a first-line investigation of lymphadenopathy, is being supplemented with an array of immunocytochemical and molecular analyses. These analyses are aimed not only at a more precise disease definition but also at recognizing factors that can predict prognosis and response to treatment.

Accepting the pitfalls of conventional cytomorphology, this review looks at molecular changes characteristic of particular lymphomas and explores the currently available technology for their detection, with particular reference to cytological material. Future protocols for the diagnosis and management of patients with lymphadenopathy should include FNAC as an initial investigation, followed by immunocytochemistry and molecular investigations. Tissue biopsy, the conventional method of diagnosis, may be avoided in selected cases.

### Prognostic factors in chronic lymphocytic leukemia-what do we need to know [^115xg2YR]. Nature Reviews Clinical Oncology (2011). Low credibility.

Of all leukemias, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) shows the highest variability in its clinical presentation and course. CLL can present as an aggressive and life-threatening leukemia or as an indolent form that will not require treatment over decades. The currently available clinical staging systems for CLL are simple and inexpensive but lack accuracy in predicting disease progression and survival on an individual basis. The increased understanding of the key events in molecular pathogenesis has provided a plethora of novel molecular and biological factors that correlate with the outcome of CLL.

This review provides a concise discussion of the most important discoveries and offers guidance on how to implement novel prognostic tools in the clinical management of CLL by applying the criteria of evidence, relevance, and simplicity to the selection of prognostic markers.

### Initial diagnostic work-up of acute leukemia: ASCO clinical practice guideline endorsement of the College of American Pathologists and American Society of Hematology guideline [^115KxbrD]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2019). High credibility.

The College of American Pathologists (CAP) and the American Society of Hematology (ASH) developed an evidence-based guideline on the initial diagnostic work-up of acute leukemia (AL). Because of the relevance of this topic to the ASCO membership, ASCO reviewed the guideline and applied a set of procedures and policies for endorsing clinical practice guidelines that have been developed by other professional organizations.

The CAP-ASH guideline on the initial diagnostic work-up of AL was reviewed for developmental rigor by methodologists. Then, an ASCO Endorsement Expert Panel updated the literature search and reviewed the content and recommendations.

The ASCO Expert Panel determined that the recommendations from the guideline, published in 2016, are clear, thorough, and based on the most relevant scientific evidence. ASCO fully endorsed the CAP-ASH guideline on the initial diagnostic work-up of AL and included some discussion points according to clinical practice and updated literature.

Twenty-seven guideline statements were reviewed. Some discussion points were included to better assess CNS involvement in leukemia and to provide novel insights into molecular diagnosis and potential markers for risk stratification and target therapy. These discussions are categorized into four sections:

- **Initial diagnosis**: Focusing on basic diagnostics and determination of risk parameters.
- **Molecular markers and minimal residual disease detection**
- **Context of referral to another institution**: With expertise in the management of AL.
- **Reporting**:

### Initial diagnostic workup of acute leukemia: Guideline from the College of American Pathologists and the American Society of Hematology [^1156NHts]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

A complete diagnosis of acute leukemia requires knowledge of clinical information combined with morphologic evaluation, immunophenotyping, and karyotype analysis, and often, molecular genetic testing. Although many aspects of the workup for acute leukemia are well accepted, few guidelines have addressed the different aspects of the diagnostic evaluation of samples from patients suspected to have acute leukemia.

- **Objective**: To develop a guideline for treating physicians and pathologists involved in the diagnostic and prognostic evaluation of new acute leukemia samples, including acute lymphoblastic leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia, and acute leukemias of ambiguous lineage.

- **Design**: The College of American Pathologists and the American Society of Hematology convened a panel of experts in hematology and hematopathology to develop recommendations. A systematic evidence review was conducted to address six key questions. Recommendations were derived from the strength of evidence, feedback received during the public comment period, and expert panel consensus.

- **Results**: Twenty-seven guideline statements were established. These ranged from recommendations on what clinical and laboratory information should be available as part of the diagnostic and prognostic evaluation of acute leukemia samples to what types of testing should be performed routinely, with recommendations on where such testing should be performed and how the results should be reported.

- **Conclusions**: The guideline provides a framework for the multiple steps, including laboratory testing, in the evaluation of acute leukemia samples.

### Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia: ESMO clinical practice guidelines for diagnosis, treatment and follow-up [^116TSXJf]. Annals of Oncology (2021). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic procedures for chronic lymphocytic leukemia, more specifically with respect to cytogenetic analysis, ESMO 2021 guidelines recommend obtaining FISH for the detection of chromosome 17 deletion affecting the tumor protein p53 expression. It is also recommended to obtain TP53 sequencing, at least exons 4–10 and exons 2–11, for the detection of TP53 gene mutation in the absence of chromosome 17 deletion before initiating treatment in patients with advanced or symptomatic stage disease. Obtain analysis as close as possible, such as within 6 months, to initiation of therapy because genetic lesions may evolve throughout the disease.

### Chronic lymphocytic leukemia: Recent advances in diagnosis and treatment [^1171sgXn]. The Oncologist (2006). Low credibility.

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a low-grade B-lineage lymphoid malignancy but may have more heterogeneity than previously thought. Many cases require no treatment at all due to an indolent course, while other patients become symptomatic or exhibit signs of rapid progression. Treatment is typically noncurative and aims to reduce symptoms. Some molecular risk features may help identify, at initial diagnosis, which patients will have a more aggressive course.

Newer CLL treatment regimens that incorporate purine nucleoside analogues and monoclonal antibodies have increased the rate of molecular complete remissions, potentially leading to better survival times. Reduced intensity allogeneic transplant conditioning regimens have made this potentially curative modality more widely available. All these treatments carry significant risks for infectious complications, which must be carefully weighed against the risks posed by the underlying disease. A proposed risk-based treatment algorithm is discussed.

### Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia in 2020: the future has arrived [^114XfgQA]. Current Oncology Reports (2020). Low credibility.

Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is the most common leukaemia in the world, with 4.9 new diagnoses per 100,000 people per year in the UK and USA. The malignant clonal proliferation and accumulation of mature B-lymphocytes is predominantly identified in older patients, with a median age of 74 at diagnosis. The majority of patients are monitored with a 'watch and wait' approach until the balance of risks and benefits favors treatment initiation. In some cases, treatment may never be needed, while in others, the disease is more aggressive, leading to rapid progression and death from disease-related causes a few years after diagnosis. This disparity in outcomes highlights the heterogeneity of CLL and the importance of risk stratification to guide treatment decisions.

Unlike its myeloid counterpart, chronic myeloid leukaemia, a pathognomonic driving mutation, BCR-ABL, has not been identified, slightly delaying the development of targeted therapies. However, over the last two decades, a dramatic increase in our understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease has led to the development of small molecule inhibitors for CLL targeting the B cell receptor pathway and the apoptotic regulator BCL2. Some of these newer therapies appear to be so effective that they may provide a curative option for patients; previously, treatment aimed to establish disease control.

In this review, we will briefly discuss recent advances in our understanding of the molecular pathology of CLL and then, in more detail, the way that CLL is managed in the UK.

### iWCLL guidelines for diagnosis, indications for treatment, response assessment, and supportive management of CLL [^1117ubjx]. Blood (2018). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and more specifically with respect to indications for treatment, the iwCLL 2018 guidelines recommend initiating therapy in patients with CLL in whom active disease is clearly documented and at least one of the following criteria is met:

- **Evidence of progressive marrow failure**: Manifested by the development or worsening of anemia and/or thrombocytopenia. Cutoff levels of hemoglobin < 10 g/dL or platelet counts < 100×10⁹/L are generally regarded as indications for treatment. However, in some patients, platelet counts < 100×10⁹/L may remain stable over a long period; this situation does not automatically require therapeutic intervention.

- **Massive splenomegaly or lymphadenopathy**: Such as splenomegaly ≥ 6 cm below the left costal margin, or progressive or symptomatic splenomegaly. Massive nodes ≥ 10 cm in the longest diameter or progressive or symptomatic lymphadenopathy.

- **Progressive lymphocytosis**: An increase of ≥ 50% over a 2-month period, or a lymphocyte doubling time < 6 months. Exclude factors contributing to lymphocytosis other than CLL.

- **Autoimmune complications**: Including anemia or thrombocytopenia poorly responsive to corticosteroids.

- **Symptomatic or functional extranodal involvement**.

- **Disease-related symptoms**: Defined by any of the following:

	- Unintentional weight loss ≥ 10% within the previous 6 months.
	- Significant fatigue.
	- Fevers ≥ 100.5 °F or 38.0 °C for ≥ 2 weeks without evidence of infection.
	- Night sweats for ≥ 1 month without evidence of infection.

### General biomarker recommendations for lymphoma [^117XZPQa]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2016). Low credibility.

Lymphoid malignancies are a heterogeneous group of tumors that have distinctive clinical and biological behaviors. The increasing prevalence of disease reflects both treatment advances and the fact that some of these tumors are indolent. The ability to determine treatment needs at diagnosis remains problematic for some of the tumors, such as in follicular lymphomas. Major clinical advances will likely depend on precision oncology that will enable identification of specific disease entities, prognostic determination at diagnosis, and identification of precise therapeutic targets and essential pathways. However, refinement in diagnostic evaluation is an evolving science. The ability to determine prognosis at diagnosis is variable, and for many of the lymphoid malignancies, prognosis can only be made after initial treatment. Clinical trials that aim to evaluate specific features of these diseases are required in order to advance clinical practice that meaningfully addresses this important public health challenge. Herein, we describe the process and general recommendations from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) clinical trials planning meeting in November 2014 to address clinical trial design and biomarker proposals in the context of NCI-supported lymphoma clinical trials in the National Clinical Trials Network.

### European recommendations and quality assurance for cytogenomic analysis of haematological neoplasms [^1178Zr5B]. Leukemia (2019). High credibility.

In this section, we provide the recommended disease-specific cytogenomic testing required, including:

- **Chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML)**: At diagnosis and follow-up for staging purposes or to monitor therapy efficacy.
- **Chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN)**: For selected cases or where there is acute leukaemic transformation.
- **Myeloid/lymphoid neoplasms with eosinophilia**: At diagnosis.
- **Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)**: At diagnosis, at disease progression, and after treatment.
- **MDS/MPN and germ line predisposition**.
- **Acute leukaemia**: At diagnosis and follow-up.
- **Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL)**: For prognostication at the time of treatment and/or clinical progression or to aid in differential diagnosis.
- **Multiple myeloma**: For prognostication.
- **Lymphoma and other lymphoproliferative disorders (LPD)**: In selected cases at diagnosis, follow-up, or relapse and to aid in differential diagnosis or prognostication.

In a proportion of cases, the diagnosis is not known at referral. Some testing, such as chromosome banding analysis and any rapid testing requested, needs to be initiated at sample reception. Thus, in the absence of any further clinical information, sufficient testing should be undertaken, taking into account the different possible diagnoses. Fixed cell cultures can be stored for analysis pending further information. Other testing, such as non-urgent FISH or molecular testing, can be initiated once more information is available.

### Initial diagnostic workup of acute leukemia: Guideline from the College of American Pathologists and the American Society of Hematology [^111aumHz]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2017). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic procedures for acute lymphoblastic leukemia, specifically concerning biopsy and histopathology, the ASH/CAP 2017 guidelines recommend obtaining sufficient samples for conventional cytogenetic analysis (karyotype), appropriate molecular genetic and/or fluorescent in situ hybridization testing, and flow cytometric immunophenotyping. These should be conducted in addition to a morphologic assessment of blood and bone marrow. Ensure that the flow cytometry panel is comprehensive enough to distinguish between acute myeloid leukemia (including acute promyelocytic leukemia), T-cell ALL (including early T-cell precursor leukemias), B-cell precursor ALL, and acute leukemia of ambiguous lineage in all diagnosed patients. This will also facilitate the subsequent detection of minimal residual disease. It is important to recognize that molecular genetic and/or fluorescent in situ hybridization testing does not replace conventional cytogenetic analysis.

### Consensus recommendations from the 2024 lymphoma research foundation workshop on treatment selection and sequencing in CLL or SLL [^111gGry1]. Blood Advances (2025). Low credibility.

Referral to a CLL expert to discuss whether to pursue allogeneic stem cell transplant (allo-SCT) may be considered for patients with CLL/SLL who are refractory to at least two prior therapies, including Ven and a cBTKi, and who obtained a remission to a subsequent therapy.

Allo-SCT is potentially curative in CLL/SLL, but fewer patients undergo allo-SCT in the modern era. A retrospective series of 65 patients with CLL/SLL who underwent allo-SCT following a targeted kinase inhibitor reported a two-year progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of 63% and 81%, respectively. High-risk molecular features did not affect PFS. Toxicity should be taken into consideration given rates of non-relapse mortality and acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease of 13%, 24%, and 27%, respectively.

In one retrospective series of allo-SCT in CLL/SLL, more than 20% bone marrow involvement before transplant was associated with failure to engraft, suggesting that some clearance of CLL/SLL from the bone marrow is necessary before transplant. However, iwCLL response (complete remission vs. partial remission) was independent of PFS rates with allo-SCT following a targeted kinase inhibitor, suggesting that achieving complete remission is not necessary before transplant.

Our panel is more likely to consider allo-SCT for patients who are young and medically fit, have high-risk cytogenetic/molecular features, or have relapsed after multiple lines of targeted therapy. With the approval of liso-cel in CLL/SLL, we expect that even fewer patients with CLL/SLL will undergo allo-SCT. With a growing list of effective standard and investigational therapies, we recommend referral to a CLL expert to explore treatment options.

### Consensus recommendations from the 2024 lymphoma research foundation workshop on treatment selection and sequencing in CLL or SLL [^115kDLra]. Blood Advances (2025). Low credibility.

Treatment selection should be individualized for patients with CLL/SLL. Pretreatment assessment should include clinical evaluation and testing of cytogenetic and molecular features. Line of treatment, previous treatments, comorbidities, and concomitant medications should be considered when selecting treatment, and shared decision-making should be used to incorporate patient preferences. Much research remains ongoing, and we will reconvene the LRF CLL working group as the treatment landscape evolves for patients with CLL/SLL.

### Acute lymphoblastic leukemia, version 2.2024, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^115yAxUv]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for acute lymphoblastic leukemia, more specifically with respect to initial evaluation, NCCN 2024 guidelines recommend obtaining the following workup for patients:

- **History and physical examination**: Ensure a comprehensive baseline assessment of patient health.

- **CBC, differential, chemistry profile, LFTs**: These tests help assess the patient's overall health and organ function.

- **DIC panel**: This includes d-dimer, fibrinogen, PT, and PTT to evaluate clotting status.

- **Tumor lysis syndrome panel**: Comprising LDH, uric acid, potassium, calcium, and phosphorus, this panel monitors for metabolic complications.

- **Hepatitis B/C, HIV testing**: Screening for viral infections that may impact treatment.

- **Pregnancy testing, fertility counseling, and preservation**: Important for family planning and treatment safety.

- **CT/MRI of head with contrast**: Conduct if neurologic symptoms are present. For patients with major neurologic signs or symptoms at diagnosis, perform appropriate imaging studies to detect meningeal disease, chloromas, or CNS bleeding.

- **Lumbar puncture with intrathecal therapy**: Perform the first lumbar puncture at the time of initial scheduled intrathecal therapy unless directed by symptoms to perform earlier.

- **CT of neck/chest/abdomen/pelvis with intravenous contrast**: Obtain as indicated for symptoms. Obtain PET/CT if lymphomatous involvement is suspected and/or confirmed by CT imaging.

- **Testicular examination**: Including scrotal ultrasound as indicated, to evaluate for testicular involvement.

- **Screen for opportunistic infections**: As appropriate for individual patient circumstances.

### Risk of second primary malignancies in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia: a population-based study in the Netherlands, 1989–2019 [^1159CsCt]. Blood Cancer Journal (2023). Low credibility.

The Netherlands Cancer Registry, established in 1989, is maintained by the Netherlands Comprehensive Cancer Organisation (IKNL), covering at least 95% of all newly diagnosed malignancies in the Netherlands. It relies on case notifications via the Nationwide Network and Registry of Histopathology and Cytopathology and the National Registry of Hospital Discharges. Information such as dates of birth and diagnosis, sex, primary therapy, and disease stage, topography, and morphology of all newly diagnosed malignancies are routinely ascertained by NCR trained registrars through retrospective review of medical records. Topography and morphology are coded according to the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology (ICD-O). Vital status (i.e. alive, dead, or emigration) is updated annually through linkage with the Nationwide Population Registries Network.

The study population includes all patients diagnosed with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) between January 1, 1989, and December 31, 2019, identified from the NCR using the ICD-O morphology code 9823. Patients diagnosed at autopsy (n = 71) were excluded. Through cross-linkage with the NCR, second primary malignancies (SPMs) diagnosed between 1989 and 2019 were identified. The ICD-O morphology and topography codes used to categorize specific SPM groupings are depicted in Supplemental Table 1. Basal cell carcinomas of the skin were considered separately.

### Prognostic markers and stratification of chronic lymphocytic leukemia [^1127xAfY]. Hematology. American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2010). Low credibility.

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is one of the most common lymphoid malignancies and is characterized by a tremendously variable clinical course. The median age at diagnosis is 72 years; however, CLL is being diagnosed with increasing frequency in younger patients. Given the toxicities associated with currently available therapies, the ability to predict which patients will need treatment could play a significant role in preserving bone marrow function and reducing morbidity and mortality. While many prognostic markers have been identified that predict outcomes for patients with CLL, learning how to use these prognostic markers to provide patient care is more challenging.

### High-risk subtypes of chronic lymphocytic leukemia are detectable as early as 16 years prior to diagnosis [^1122hLbC]. Blood (2022). High credibility.

Since 2008, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) has been defined by the presence of a persisting monoclonal B-cell population ≥ 5 × 10⁹ cells per liter, whereas monoclonal expansions below this limit are classified as monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (MBL). MBL has been detected up to six years before a CLL diagnosis. Clinically, MBL is categorized as high count (HC) or low count (LC), based on a cutoff of 0.5 × 10⁹ cells per liter. LC MBL can be detected in up to 12% of the elderly population and is found at an increased prevalence in relatives of patients with CLL. HC MBL cases progress to CLL requiring treatment at a rate of approximately 1% per year.

A key factor for risk stratification of patients with CLL is the somatic hypermutation status of the immunoglobulin heavy variable (IGHV) gene. CLL cases with mutated IGHV (M-CLL) genes are generally characterized by a more prolonged indolent disease course than cases of CLL with unmutated IGHV genes (U-CLL). Another prognostically relevant immunogenetic feature of CLL concerns the stereotypy of the B-cell receptor (BcR) immunoglobulins (IGs). Indeed, distinct stereotyped subsets can be defined by the expression of shared sequence motifs and are associated with particular presentations and outcomes.

In this context, we aimed to gain insight into the composition of the BcR IG repertoire during the early stages of CLL through the in-depth study of samples taken up to 22 years before diagnosis.

### iWCLL guidelines for diagnosis, indications for treatment, response assessment, and supportive management of CLL [^1117Wsjj]. Blood (2018). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for chronic lymphocytic leukemia, more specifically concerning history and physical examination, the iwCLL 2018 guidelines recommend recording the bidimensional diameters of the largest palpable lymph nodes in each of the following sites: cervical, axillary, and inguinal. Moreover, record the dimensions of the liver and spleen below their respective costal margins, as assessed by palpation. Be aware of the fact that any of these manifestations of CLL, particularly hepatomegaly, could be caused by a variety of other diseases.
