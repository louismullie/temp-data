## Question

A 45-year-old man from rural Bolivia presents to your clinic in the United States for evaluation of chronic fatigue and intermittent palpitations. He reports a history of living in adobe houses and recalls being bitten by insects at night as a child. He has no acute symptoms now, but his ECG shows right bundle branch block. You suspect chronic Chagas disease.

According to CDC guidelines, what is the appropriate approach to serologic testing for the diagnosis of chronic Chagas disease in this patient?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the appropriate serologic testing approach for suspected chronic Chagas disease in a 45-year-old man from rural Bolivia with a right bundle branch block on ECG. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about pretest probability and whether he meets screening criteria. Then, I should verify the phase of disease and why serology is preferred over direct parasite detection. Next, I will review the CDC-recommended two-test algorithm and how to handle discordant results. After that, I need to check which assays are available and how to operationalize testing, including when to send samples to CDC. Finally, I will consider special situations like cross-reactivity and outline next steps if serology is positive, including baseline staging and follow-up.

> Let me first confirm the pretest probability. He has classic epidemiologic risk from rural Bolivia with adobe housing and nighttime insect bites consistent with triatomine exposure, and his ECG shows a right bundle branch block, which is an early manifestation of Chagas cardiomyopathy. Together, this substantially increases the likelihood of chronic Trypanosoma cruzi infection and supports screening and diagnostic testing in this patient [^a5b9575c] [^de77fd37].

> Wait, let me verify the disease phase before choosing tests. In chronic Chagas disease, parasitemia is low or intermittent and not reliably detected by microscopy or conventional PCR, so diagnosis must rely on serologic detection of IgG antibodies rather than direct parasite methods, which are reserved for acute infection or special contexts like immunosuppression and reactivation risk [^736a1cc1] [^043745ba].

> I need to ensure I apply the correct diagnostic algorithm. CDC recommends that confirmed diagnosis of chronic T. cruzi infection requires at least two distinct serologic assays, ideally based on different antigens or methodologies, because no single test has adequate sensitivity and specificity to stand alone. If the first two results are discordant, a third distinct assay should be used to adjudicate, reflecting the absence of a perfect gold standard [^4a4f52c5] [^d9aea953] [^b603c510].

> Hold on, I should verify which assays are appropriate and available. FDA-cleared options include ELISAs based on whole parasite lysate or recombinant antigens and a rapid immunochromatographic test; however, performance varies by geographic origin of infection, with lower sensitivity often seen in specimens from Mexico and some Central American regions compared with South America, reinforcing the need for a two-test strategy and cautious interpretation in Bolivian patients as well [^ce1cffd0] [^37d52287] [^b56b6804].

> Let me think about operationalizing this. Most commercial laboratories in the U.S. run only one IgG assay, so a practical approach is to obtain a screening test locally and then send the specimen to CDC for confirmatory testing using a second, different assay. CDC performs an ELISA and a TESA immunoblot, and if results are discordant, they add a third test such as IFA, which fulfills the two-different-tests requirement and improves diagnostic certainty [^d9aea953] [^b603c510].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought PCR might help here, but I should double-check that. PCR has limited sensitivity in chronic infection due to low parasitemia and is not recommended for routine diagnosis of chronic Chagas disease; it becomes useful mainly in acute infection, congenital screening algorithms, or immunosuppressed hosts where reactivation is a concern, so I should not rely on PCR to confirm chronic infection in this patient [^736a1cc1] [^043745ba].

> I will now examine how to handle discordant results. If the first two serologic tests disagree, a third distinct assay is required to assign a final status. Importantly, because there is no perfect reference standard, a minority of cases remain unresolved even after a third test, in which case clinical judgment, repeat testing after an interval, or referral to CDC for expert consultation may be needed [^d9aea953] [^b603c510].

> But wait, what if cross-reactivity is a concern. Whole-parasite antigen assays can cross-react with leishmaniasis, which is not endemic in Bolivia but may be relevant if there is travel history to overlapping regions. If clinical suspicion remains high and serology is discordant or unexpectedly negative, consider geographic test performance and, when indicated, pursue CDC confirmatory testing that includes TESA-blot, which can help resolve some discordant cases [^71c30888] [^4de677c5].

> Next, I should review what to do if serology is positive. A confirmed diagnosis warrants baseline staging with a 12-lead ECG and echocardiography to assess for cardiomyopathy, even if asymptomatic, and ECG should be repeated periodically to detect progression. Given his RBBB, he already has early cardiac involvement, so cardiology referral and longitudinal follow-up are appropriate, and antiparasitic therapy should be considered in adults without advanced heart disease, balancing benefits and adverse effects [^dc3175db] [^3c14b6d7] [^4a420e67].

> Let me reconsider the full algorithm to ensure nothing is missing. Screen based on epidemiologic risk, obtain two distinct serologic assays with different antigens or methods, send to CDC if needed to secure a second different test, resolve discordance with a third assay, and if confirmed, stage with ECG and echocardiography and discuss antiparasitic treatment. This approach aligns with CDC and IDSA/ASM guidance and addresses the limitations of single-assay testing in U.S. practice [^4a4f52c5] [^71c30888] [^d9aea953].

---

The CDC-recommended approach is to **use two distinct serologic tests** (different antigens or methods, e.g. ELISA and IFA) to diagnose chronic Chagas disease [^4a4f52c5], because no single assay is sufficiently sensitive and specific [^d9aea953]. If results are discordant, a **third test** is required [^d9aea953]. PCR is not recommended for chronic-phase diagnosis due to low sensitivity [^e983f0e8]. For this patient, order two different IgG serologic tests and, if needed, send samples to CDC for confirmatory testing [^d9aea953].

---

## Recommended serologic testing algorithm

### Step 1: initial screening test

- **Test selection**: Use a high-sensitivity screening test, such as an ELISA or chemiluminescent immunoassay (CMIA) [^e5b552d0], to detect T. cruzi IgG antibodies [^notfound].

- **Rationale**: A high-sensitivity test minimizes false negatives, which is critical in low-prevalence settings like the United States [^e5b552d0].

---

### Step 2: confirmatory test

- **Test selection**: If the screening test is positive, confirm with a second serologic test that uses different antigens or methods (e.g. indirect immunofluorescence assay [IFA] or immunoblot) [^4a4f52c5].

- **Rationale**: Using two distinct assays improves specificity and reduces false positives, as no single test is sufficiently accurate [^d9aea953].

---

### Step 3: resolution of discordant results

If the screening and confirmatory tests yield discordant results, perform a **third serologic test** (e.g. TESA immunoblot) to resolve the discrepancy [^d9aea953]. Discordant results are common due to geographic variability in T. cruzi strains and assay performance [^b56b6804].

---

## Role of PCR in chronic Chagas disease

PCR is **not recommended for routine diagnosis** of chronic Chagas disease because parasitemia is low and intermittent, resulting in low sensitivity [^e983f0e8]. PCR may be useful in specific scenarios, such as suspected reactivation in immunosuppressed patients or congenital infection, but it is not a substitute for serologic testing in chronic disease [^c0744ce2].

---

## Available serologic tests in the United States

Several serologic tests are available in the United States, including:

| **Test name** | **Method** | **Antigen** | **Fda-cleared** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Ortho T. cruzi ELISA | ELISA | Whole parasite lysate | Yes |
| Hemagen Chagas' kit ELISA | ELISA | Whole parasite lysate | Yes |
| Wiener Chagatest Recombinante v3.0 | ELISA | Recombinant antigens | Yes |
| InBios Chagas Detect Plus | Rapid immunochromatographic | Recombinant antigens | Yes |

---

These tests have varying performance characteristics, and **geographic variability** in T. cruzi strains can affect sensitivity and specificity [^b56b6804]. Therefore, using two distinct tests is essential for accurate diagnosis [^d9aea953].

---

## Clinical implications of positive serology

A confirmed diagnosis of chronic Chagas disease **requires positive results from two distinct serologic tests** [^4a4f52c5]. Once confirmed, patients should undergo baseline cardiac evaluation, including a 12-lead ECG and echocardiogram, to assess for cardiomyopathy or conduction abnormalities [^3c14b6d7]. Even if asymptomatic, patients with confirmed infection should be monitored regularly for disease progression [^4a420e67].

---

## Summary of CDC-recommended approach

- **Step 1**: Perform initial screening with a high-sensitivity serologic test (ELISA or CMIA) [^e5b552d0].

- **Step 2**: Confirm positive results with a second serologic test using different antigens or methods (e.g. IFA or immunoblot) [^4a4f52c5].

- **Step 3**: If results are discordant, perform a third serologic test to resolve the discrepancy [^d9aea953].

- **Step 4**: Do not rely on PCR for chronic-phase diagnosis due to low sensitivity [^e983f0e8].

- **Step 5**: If both tests are positive, confirm chronic Chagas disease and proceed with baseline cardiac evaluation and regular monitoring [^3c14b6d7].

---

The CDC recommends using **two distinct serologic tests** to diagnose chronic Chagas disease, with a third test if results are discordant. PCR is not recommended for chronic-phase diagnosis. This approach ensures accurate diagnosis and appropriate management of patients with suspected chronic Chagas disease [^4a4f52c5].

Background

Chagas disease affects an estimated 326 000-347 000 people in the United States and is severely underdiagnosed. Lack of awareness and clarity regarding screening and diagnosis is a key barrier. This article provides straightforward recommendations, with the goal of simplifying identification and testing of people at risk for US healthcare providers.

Methods

A multidisciplinary working group of clinicians and researchers with expertise in Chagas disease agreed on 6 main questions, and developed recommendations based on the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology, after reviewing the relevant literature on Chagas disease in the United States.

Results

Individuals who were born or resided for prolonged time periods in endemic countries of Mexico and Central and South America should be tested for Trypanosoma cruzi infection, and family members of people who test positive should be screened. Women of childbearing age with risk factors and infants born to seropositive mothers deserve special consideration due to the risk of vertical transmission. Diagnostic testing for chronic T. cruzi infection should be conducted using 2 distinct assays.

Conclusions

Increasing provider-directed screening for T. cruzi infection is key to addressing this neglected public health challenge in the United States.

Because parasitemia levels can fluctuate, the serologic status of infants born to mothers with chronic CD should be monitored even if the infant has negative PCR results early in life. Transferred maternal IgG antibodies persist in infants for up to 12 months. If an infant first evaluated at 3 months of age or older has a positive CD screening T. cruzi IgG test, performed through a commercial laboratory, repeat screening should be performed when the infant reaches 9 to 12 months of age. If antibody remains detectable, confirmatory serologic testing through CDC is appropriate to establish or exclude congenital infection (Figure 2). An increase in antibody titer over time after 9 months of age, documented at CDC, indicates congenital infection.

What Is the Recommended Algorithm for Diagnosing Chagas Disease in the United States?

Recommendations.

Diagnostic testing for chronic T. cruzi infection should be conducted using 2 distinct assays, based on different antigens or in different formats, following Pan American Health Organization and CDC guidelines. If the results are discordant, a third distinct test should be performed. Confirmed diagnosis requires positive results by at least 2 tests (strong, moderate).
Screening by clinical and public health laboratories in populations with low T. cruzi infection prevalence should be conducted using a high-sensitivity test, bearing in mind the anticipated false-positive rate of (1 − specificity). Individuals with positive results by the screening test require confirmatory testing as outlined in the above recommendation (strong, moderate).

Confirmation of chronic T. cruzi infection requires positive results by 2 different tests, preferably based on different antigens, to optimize sensitivity and specificity. However, most commercial laboratories in the United States only utilize 1 assay. If positive based on commercial laboratory results, sending samples to CDC for confirmation assures that the criteria of 2 distinct assays is met. More confirmatory testing options may become available in the future. Clinicians should check with their healthcare system’s clinical laboratory for current or preferred confirmatory testing options.

Providers can contact CDC with questions about CD (parasites@cdc.gov, 404–718–4745). Requests for CDC testing should be coordinated with the state or local health department.

What Is the Appropriate Course of Action if the Screening and Confirmatory Tests for Chagas Disease Are Discordant?

The lack of a gold standard CD test necessitates multistep serological testing to confirm chronic T. cruzi infection. Discordant test results can be expected due to imperfect test performance and will be a large proportion of total results given CD’s overall low prevalence in the United States. When the results of the first 2 assays are discordant, a third test is required to assign a consensus positive or negative status for the presence of IgG antibodies to T. cruzi in the individual.

Diagnostic serologic testing in the United States is primarily available at commercial reference laboratories and CDC. Currently, CDC performs an ELISA (Chagatest Recombinante v0.3.0; Wiener Laboratories) and an immunoblot using trypomastigote excreted-secreted antigens (TESA) when CD serology is requested. If results are discordant, a second sample is requested; if results are again discordant, a third serologic test is run (immunofluorescence assay [IFA] based on slide-fixed epimastigotes). At CDC, the TESA and IFA assays are laboratory-developed tests and all tests are run under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA). Currently, the FDA does not clear or approve laboratory-developed tests, but their validation and performance is reviewed during laboratory inspections to maintain CLIA certification. There are no published diagnostic evaluations for the CDC TESA and IFA tests in infected populations of the United States, but these test formats have been widely used throughout Latin America.

Most testing currently begins with a commercial laboratory, where typically only one IgG assay is used. Commercial laboratories periodically change the tests they employ due to commercial availability, cost, and testing format and performance. To ensure that 2 different serologic assays are used, it will be necessary to confirm which assay is being performed. In general, a sample should then be sent to CDC for confirmation.

Chagas disease (Trypanosoma cruzi) diagnosis—screening and serology: Screening with serological testing is recommended for all individuals who have lived in Mexico or Central or South America for greater than 6 months, and most persons infected with T. cruzi are in the chronic phase and are typically unaware of their infection. Screening for infection to identify persons with the indeterminate or early clinical forms of chronic Chagas disease is important to identify those who might benefit from antiparasitic treatment and counseling regarding potential transmission of T. cruzi to others (e.g., blood donation, organ donation), which is particularly important for people with HIV because of the risk of reactivation disease. Diagnosis of chronic infection relies on serological methods to detect immunoglobulin G antibodies to T. cruzi, most commonly enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunofluorescent antibody assay (IFA), but no available assay has sufficient sensitivity and specificity to be used alone; a single positive result does not constitute a confirmed diagnosis. Two serological tests based on different antigens (i.e., whole parasite lysate and recombinant antigens) and/or techniques (e.g., ELISA and IFA) should be used for individuals with suspected Chagas, though in some cases the infection status remains difficult to resolve even after a third test because there is no true gold standard assay for chronic T. cruzi infection.

### Recommendations for screening and diagnosis of Chagas disease in the United States [^2f25eaa5]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Chagas disease (CD) is a neglected tropical disease of substantial public health importance. In the United States, >300 000 people are estimated to be infected with Trypanosoma cruzi, the protozoan that causes the disease. The vast majority were infected while living in endemic areas of Latin America and are in a chronic phase of the disease. While most remain asymptomatic for life, 20%–30% eventually develop Chagas cardiomyopathy, and up to 10% may suffer damage to the gastrointestinal or nervous systems. CD causes a heavy burden of morbidity and mortality, resulting in an estimated global annual loss of >800 000 disability-adjusted life-years, including >27 000 annually in the United States. Only about 1% of estimated US cases have been identified, usually through blood donor screening. Most people are unaware they are infected with T. cruzi. Provider-directed screening is essential because early diagnosis and treatment can improve outcomes and limit mother-to-child transmission. Screening programs for CD are highly cost-effective, but with the current paradigm of limited testing, estimated total annual healthcare costs from CD in the United States exceed $130 000 000. However, not all US providers are aware of CD and testing poses certain challenges.

The Pan American Health Organization has provided overall guidelines on diagnosis and management of CD. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website also provides specific recommendations for healthcare providers. Here we examine considerations for screening and diagnosis of CD in the United States.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Chagas disease in HIV—screening and serologic diagnosis emphasize that most patients in the United States are in the chronic phase and unaware of infection, and screening for indeterminate or early chronic forms is important to identify candidates for antiparasitic treatment and transmission counseling, particularly in HIV-infected patients because of reactivation risk. Diagnosis of chronic infection relies on serological detection of immunoglobulin G antibodies to T. cruzi, most commonly enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunofluorescent antibody assay (IFA), but no single assay has sufficient sensitivity and specificity to be used alone, so two serological tests based on different antigens and/or techniques are used in parallel; infection status may remain unresolved even after a third test due to the lack of a true gold standard, sensitivity varies by geography, and U.S. options include ELISA kits based on parasite lysate or recombinant antigens. In general, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is not a useful diagnostic test for chronic T. cruzi infection, with highly variable sensitivity depending on patient characteristics and PCR methods.

DISCUSSION

Our data provide initial evidence for an appropriate diagnostic algorithm for Chagas disease in the United States. The direct comparison of the four FDA-cleared tests demonstrated a range of sensitivity and specificity estimates across tests as well as consistent variation in sensitivity by country of origin. On the basis of these findings, we can develop preliminary guidance for optimal use of these tests, anticipate associated challenges, and identify where improvements are needed.

In common with recommendations for syphilis and early algorithms for HIV, definitive diagnosis of chronicinfection requires positive results by two distinct tests. This algorithm was developed to address issues of both sensitivity and specificity. Simultaneous use of two tests optimizes both parameters and may be cost-effective in high-prevalence settings. However, when low prevalence is anticipated, universal testing by two assays is impractical. Most programs will use one test as a screen and analyze only the screen positives by the second assay. In these circumstances, the order is crucial; a high-sensitivity screening test is essential to minimize the risk of missing true infections (Fig. 2). At the same time, if specificity is not high, an assay will result in many false positives, potentially undermining confidence in testing. For example, in a setting of 1.5% prevalence, any specificity lower than 98.5% will result in more false-positive than true-positive results.

Screening and Diagnosis in Immunosuppressed Patients

Immunosuppressed hosts with acute T. cruzi infection (eg, donor-derived infection) are at risk for severe manifestations such as meningoencephalitis or acute myocarditis. Recipients of blood components, organ, or tissue from an infected donor should be monitored by serial polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in blood weekly during months 1–2, every 2 weeks during months 3–4, monthly during months 5–6 posttransfusion or transplant, then based on the clinical scenario.

Immunosuppression in an individual with chronic T. cruzi infection may lead to reactivation, characterized by a return to high levels of parasitemia. In transplant recipients, manifestations of reactivation vary depending on host characteristics and immunosuppressive regimen; reactivation myocarditis can be life threatening. A positive PCR result does not constitute a diagnosis of reactivation, because this occurs in patients with chronic infection in the absence of reactivation. Serial monitoring by quantitative PCR, using a schedule similar to that outlined above, provides early detection of reactivation based on falling cycle threshold (Ct) values, reflecting rising parasite loads. The US CDC provides consultation on the management of patients and acts as a reference laboratory to monitor for reactivation by serial PCR. The most common manifestations of reactivation in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)- T. cruzi coinfected patients include central nervous system (CNS) mass lesions, with or without meningoencephalitis, and myocarditis. Diagnosis varies depending on the clinical scenario; in CNS reactivation, parasites may be detectable by microscopy or PCR of cerebrospinal fluid.

DISCUSSION

Uncertainties and complexities around current CD testing processes in the United States pose a major barrier to increasing screening coverage, perpetuating a situation where <1% of the estimated population with the disease has been tested. This document provides clear, straightforward guidance to healthcare personnel to facilitate screening and diagnosis of the people at risk, so that they can receive timely and appropriate care. While more research is needed, both on the epidemiology of CD in the United States, including congenital and vector-borne transmission and the burden of disease in specific populations, and on the performance of diagnostic tools in the heterogeneous US patient population, this document presents practical recommendations based on the best information currently available. Ensuring proactive screening of patients will require concerted efforts to increase provider awareness, convey accurate information to the public about CD and its risks, and improve access to and performance of diagnostic technology and tools.

FDA-Cleared Serological Tests for Chagas Disease

Four IgG serological tests have FDA clearance for diagnosis of chronic T. cruzi infection (Table 1), 2 are T. cruzi lysate-based enzyme-linked immunoassays (ELISAs; Ortho T. cruzi ELISA and Hemagen Chagas’ kit ELISA); a recombinant antigen-based ELISA (Wiener Chagatest Recombinante 3.0); and a recombinant antigen-based immunochromatographic strip test (InBios Chagas Detect Plus). All 4 tests have high manufacturer-reported sensitivity and specificity, but postclearance performance data are sparse, especially in US-resident populations (Supplementary Table 1). In US-based evaluations, the Wiener Chagatest Recombinante 3.0 assay consistently showed high specificity and intermediate sensitivity. Investigations also confirm variation in assay performance by geographic origin of infections, with sensitivity generally highest in specimens from South America, intermediate in Central America, and lowest in those from Mexico, Panama, and southern Peru. These differences are often attributed to T. cruzi genetic differences, but do not correlate entirely with the predominant lineages as currently identified. Further diagnostic test evaluations in robust sets of specimens from at-risk US populations are needed to provide an adequate evidence base for recommendations for use of specific assays.

However, prospective parallel testing by multiple assays in population-level screening may be prohibitively expensive. In a serial testing scenario, the population is screened by a single test and only those with positive results receive a second, confirmatory test; when the results are discordant, a third test is used as a tiebreaker. Algorithms should be designed with test performance characteristics in mind; a deliberate choice must be made regarding the acceptable number of missed infections versus the cost of additional testing (and the logistics of having patients return for testing) required to rule out false positives. Figure 3 provides a basic framework of the testing process, from identification of risk factors to diagnostic confirmation.

Chagas disease—chronic-stage laboratory diagnosis emphasizes serology as the test of choice, with diagnosis of chronic Chagas disease based on positive results from at least two different serologic tests, ideally employing different methodologies; the CDC offers EIA and immunoblot first-line tests, and discordant results are resolved by repeat testing with a second specimen and, if needed, a third test such as IFA. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing is also available through the CDC. Positive serology is considered evidence of active infection and would exclude potential blood/tissue donors, and cross-reactivity with leishmaniasis may occur with whole-parasite antigen assays, prompting additional testing when indicated.

Chagas disease—epidemiology and transmission: Vector-borne transmission occurs only in the Americas, where an estimated 8 to 10 million people have Chagas disease, and in the United States infected triatomine vectors and T. cruzi–infected domestic and wild animals are found across the southern half of the country with rare autochthonous cases documented and the risk appearing to be very low. T. cruzi also can be transmitted in blood; screening of blood donations for anti–T. cruzi antibodies was introduced in 2007, and currently an estimated 90% of the U.S. blood supply is screened. Estimates are that the vast majority of the estimated 300,000 individuals in the United States with Chagas disease are immigrants who acquired infection while living in endemic areas of Latin America. In chronically infected patients, profound immunosuppression (e.g., due to advanced human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] disease) may lead to reactivation disease characterized by parasitemia with increased intracellular parasite replication and lack of immunological control of infection.

### Evaluation and treatment of Chagas disease in the United States: a systematic review [^4a420e67]. JAMA (2007). Excellent credibility.

Context

Because of population migration from endemic areas and newly instituted blood bank screening, US clinicians are likely to see an increasing number of patients with suspected or confirmed chronic Trypanosoma cruzi infection (Chagas disease).

Objective

To examine the evidence base and provide practical recommendations for evaluation, counseling, and etiologic treatment of patients with chronic T cruzi infection. Evidence Acquisition Literature review conducted based on a systematic MEDLINE search for all available years through 2007; review of additional articles, reports, and book chapters; and input from experts in the field.

Evidence Synthesis

The patient newly diagnosed with Chagas disease should undergo a medical history, physical examination, and resting 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) with a 30-second lead II rhythm strip. If this evaluation is normal, no further testing is indicated; history, physical examination, and ECG should be repeated annually. If findings suggest Chagas heart disease, a comprehensive cardiac evaluation, including 24-hour ambulatory ECG monitoring, echocardiography, and exercise testing, is recommended. If gastrointestinal tract symptoms are present, barium contrast studies should be performed. Antitrypanosomal treatment is recommended for all cases of acute and congenital Chagas disease, reactivated infection, and chronic T cruzi infection in individuals 18 years or younger. In adults aged 19 to 50 years without advanced heart disease, etiologic treatment may slow development and progression of cardiomyopathy and should generally be offered; treatment is considered optional for those older than 50 years. Individualized treatment decisions for adults should balance the potential benefit, prolonged course, and frequent adverse effects of the drugs. Strong consideration should be given to treatment of previously untreated patients with human immunodeficiency virus infection or those expecting to undergo organ transplantation.

Conclusions

Chagas disease presents an increasing challenge for clinicians in the United States. Despite gaps in the evidence base, current knowledge is sufficient to make practical recommendations to guide appropriate evaluation, management, and etiologic treatment of Chagas disease.

Chagas disease—clinical manifestations in acute and chronic phases: The acute phase of T. cruzi infection typically goes unrecognized, lasts up to 90 days, and is characterized by circulating trypomastigotes detectable on microscopy of fresh blood or buffy coat smears; at the end of the acute phase, typically 60 to 90 days after infection, parasitemia falls below levels detectable by microscopy and, in the absence of effective antitrypanosomal treatment, infection passes into the chronic phase; most patients with chronic T. cruzi infection have no signs or symptoms and are said to have the indeterminate form, but over the course of their lives, 20% to 30% will progress to clinically evident Chagas disease—most commonly cardiomyopathy—with early manifestations usually being conduction system abnormalities such as right bundle branch block alone or with frequent premature ventricular contractions.

### Screening for Chagas disease should be included in entry-to-care testing for at-risk people with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) living in the United States [^0f290ade]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Chagas disease screening of at-risk populations is essential to identify infected individuals and facilitate timely treatment before end-organ damage occurs. Coinfected people with human immunodeficiency virus (PWH) are at risk for dangerous sequelae, specifically Trypanosoma cruzi reactivation disease. Recently published national recommendations indicate that at-risk PWH, particularly those from endemic areas or born to women from endemic areas, should be screened via a sensitive anti-T. cruzi IgG assay. However, immunocompromised patients with negative serologic results may warrant further investigation. Reactivation should be suspected in at-risk, untreated PWH with low CD4 cell counts presenting with acute neurologic or cardiac symptoms; these patients should be promptly evaluated and treated. One pragmatic solution to improve Chagas disease screening among PWH and thereby reduce T. cruzi-related morbidity and mortality is to incorporate Chagas disease screening into the panel of tests routinely performed during the entry-to-care evaluation for at-risk PWH.

METHODS

A group of experts on CD screening and management in the United States, including clinicians, researchers, and public health experts, prepared these recommendations. Group members had previously participated in meetings on challenges in diagnosis of CD. The working group was organized to provide a straightforward, quick-reference tool to facilitate CD testing by primary healthcare providers, hospitals, infectious disease specialists, and laboratories. Diagnostic guidance was constructed via both expert consensus and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology. The group agreed on 6 main questions based on the PICO method (Population, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcome) and divided into subgroups to discuss each and propose initial recommendations, which were then shared and validated within the larger group. Literature searches were conducted on CD screening and prevalence in the United States and the 4 assays that are currently Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-cleared for clinical use (Table 1).

Table 1. 
Trypanosoma cruzi -Specific IgG Antibody Assays With Food and Drug Administration Diagnostic Clearance a

The GRADE methodology provides 2 types of ratings. The strength of the recommendation (strong or conditional, either for or against a recommendation) is based on the public health priority, potential benefit, feasibility of implementation, acceptability to patients, and costs in terms of resources. An additional rating is provided for the quality of available evidence supporting the recommendation (high, moderate, low, very low), which considers previous study designs, effect size, relevance, sources of bias, and other factors. Two key limitations should be noted: (1) the evidence on US CD has significant gaps, and (2) while the GRADE methodology provides a structured, evidence-based framework, this does not completely rule out subjectivity in determining ratings.

What Is the Next Step After a Patient Has a Confirmed Diagnosis of Chagas Disease?

Recommendation.

1. Even if asymptomatic, individuals who test positive for T. cruzi infection should receive: Electrocardiogram (strong, high) Echocardiogram (strong, low) Chest X-ray, if an echocardiogram is unavailable (conditional, low).

Individuals with T. cruzi infection may have no evidence of organ involvement (indeterminate form) or organ involvement with or without noticeable symptoms. Individuals with any of these forms would be expected to be seropositive. Determining whether the patient has the indeterminate form of CD or has progressed to Chagas cardiomyopathy or other end-organ involvement is important for establishing a treatment plan. A normal echocardiogram and ECG indicate an indeterminate form of CD. In settings where an echocardiogram is not available, a chest X-ray may be considered instead. The ECG should be repeated annually to detect signs of progression to Chagas cardiomyopathy, even in individuals who receive antitrypanosomal treatment. Echocardiogram may be repeated depending on the patient’s clinical status. Those with cardiac symptoms and/or abnormalities on 1 or more of the above tests should be referred to a cardiologist for more extensive testing. Patients with immunosuppressive conditions require special consideration due to the risk of reactivation and should be referred to an infectious disease specialist. Patients from southern Cone countries of South America (Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, and Paraguay) may be more at risk for gastrointestinal complications. Steps for diagnosis and management of gastrointestinal CD are provided by Pinazo et al.

Trypanosomiasis, American (Chagas’ disease) due to Trypanosoma cruzi—acute disease is evaluated by microscopy of Giemsa-stained thick and thin blood films or buffy coat preps, while chronic infection is assessed by serology available through the CDC and reference laboratories, and positive serology should be confirmed using a second test that employs different antigens. There is an infection hazard from live organisms in blood specimens. In chronic infection, parasitemia is very low and serology is preferred; IgG antibody may persist for decades and is not necessarily diagnostic of active infection. Molecular testing is available through the CDC.

Chagas disease in HIV—latent infection screening and prevention include testing at-risk patients and selected preventive measures. Clinical manifestations in HIV-positive patients usually represent reactivation and not acute infection with T. cruzi. All HIV-infected patients with epidemiologic risk factors for Chagas disease should be tested for antibody to T. cruzi to detect latent infection. A single course of treatment with benznidazole or nifurtimox can be considered for T. cruzi-infected individuals who have not been previously treated and who do not have advanced Chagas cardiomyopathy (CIII). Although direct data are lacking, optimization of antiretroviral therapy (ART) may help prevent Chagas reactivation in co-infected patients (BIII), and most symptomatic reactivation cases have occurred in patients who were not taking ART.

### Chagas disease screening using point-of-care testing in an at-risk obstetric population [^68232b95]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

Chagas disease (CD) is a parasitic disease caused by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi ; it affects more than 5.7 million people worldwide, claims 12,000 lives annually, and causes the greatest burden of disability-adjusted life years of any parasitic disease in Latin America. Approximately 1.2 million of those affected are women of childbearing age. Chagas disease is present in rural areas in endemic countries, and due to migration of infected individuals from rural to urban areas in Latin America and international migration from endemic to non-endemic countries, CD has emerged as a public health concern in non-endemic countries, including the United States. Approximately 23 million people living in the United States were born in CD-endemic countries, and an estimated > 300,000 people living in the United States are infected with CD.Most individuals infected are asymptomatic and unaware, making CD challenging to diagnose and treat. For patients with chronic, untreated CD, 20–30% will ultimately progress to the “determinate” disease form, characterized by irreversible heart and/or gastrointestinal disease with high morbidity and mortality. Diagnosis in the asymptomatic phase is essential to avoid long-term consequences.

### Recommendations for screening and diagnosis of Chagas disease in the United States [^8e8b8c20]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Recommendation.

1. Infants in whom congenital CD is suspected should undergo evaluation using existing CDC-based recommendations (strong, moderate).

Edwards et al 2019 provides a comprehensive review of diagnosis and treatment of congenital CD that is summarized below. Infants born to women with suspected or confirmed CD, and infants with clinical features of congenital infection born to women at risk for CD, should undergo evaluation as soon as possible after birth to detect hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, anemia, or thrombocytopenia and, as indicated, pneumonitis, heart failure, cardiac arrhythmia, or meningoencephalitis (Figure 1). The cure rate for treatment in the first year of infection exceeds 90%, and treatment is well tolerated.

Figure 1. 
Algorithm for evaluation of congenital Chagas disease for infants ≤ 3 months of age born to a mother with suspected or confirmed Chagas disease, or infant with symptoms of congenital Chagas disease born to an at-risk mother with serological status unknown. Source: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Abbreviations: CCD, congenital Chagas disease; PCR, polymerase chain reaction.

If the mother’s infection status is unknown, serologic testing for T. cruzi immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies should be performed to determine infant risk. Diagnosis of congenital infection relies on detection of motile trypomastigotes through microscopic examination of a wet mount of fresh anticoagulated blood or buffy coat specimen (collected in a microhematocrit tube), detection of parasites on Giemsa-stained blood smears, and/or PCR testing for T. cruzi DNA in whole blood from the infant. This testing is available through the Parasitic Diseases Reference Laboratory at the CDC. Histopathologic examination of the umbilical cord and examination of cerebrospinal fluid in at-risk infants with meningoencephalitis may also reveal the parasite. Because maternal blood contamination has been reported in a small number of infants born to infected mothers, a positive PCR result in an infant should be confirmed by repeat testing (Figure 1). If a second PCR is positive, the diagnosis of congenital CD is confirmed and the infant should undergo clinical evaluation for features of congenital CD (such as cardiac arrhythmias), laboratory evaluation, and initiation of treatment. For mothers who are seropositive for T. cruzi infection whose infants are PCR negative, infants should undergo repeat testing at 4 to 6 weeks of age to confirm absence of infection.

### Neglected parasitic infections: what family physicians need to know – A CDC update [^600a5d36]. American Family Physician (2021). Medium credibility.

Chagas disease, cysticercosis, and toxoplasmosis affect millions of people in the United States and are considered neglected parasitic diseases. Few resources are devoted to their surveillance, prevention, and treatment. Chagas disease, transmitted by kissing bugs, primarily affects people who have lived in Mexico, Central America, and South America, and it can cause heart disease and death if not treated. Chagas disease is diagnosed by detecting the parasite in blood or by serology, depending on the phase of disease. Antiparasitic treatment is indicated for most patients with acute disease. Treatment for chronic disease is recommended for people younger than 18 years and generally recommended for adults younger than 50 years. Treatment decisions should be individualized for all other patients. Cysticercosis can manifest in muscles, the eyes, and most critically in the brain (neurocysticercosis). Neurocysticercosis accounts for 2.1% of all emergency department visits for seizures in the United States. Diagnosing neurocysticercosis involves serology and neuroimaging. Treatment includes symptom control and antiparasitic therapy. Toxoplasmosis is estimated to affect 11% of people older than six years in the United States. It can be acquired by ingesting food or water that has been contaminated by cat feces; it can also be acquired by eating undercooked, contaminated meat. Toxoplasma infection is usually asymptomatic; however, people who are immunosuppressed can develop more severe neurologic symptoms. Congenital infection can result in miscarriage or adverse fetal effects. Diagnosis is made with serologic testing, polymerase chain reaction testing, or parasite detection in tissue or fluid specimens. Treatment is recommended for people who are immunosuppressed, pregnant patients with recently acquired infection, and people who are immunocompetent with visceral disease or severe symptoms.

Chagas disease (American trypanosomiasis)—preventing manifestations in people with HIV emphasizes targeted serologic screening and optional antiparasitic therapy. All people with HIV who have epidemiologic risk factors for Chagas disease should be tested for antibody to T. cruzi using at least two serological tests based on different antigens and/or techniques (e.g., enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunofluorescence assay (IFA)). For individuals with epidemiological risk factors who test antibody-positive, have not been previously treated, and do not have advanced Chagas cardiomyopathy, a single course of benznidazole or nifurtimox is recommended by some experts, using the same doses as for acute/reactivated disease: benznidazole 5–8 mg/kg/day PO in 2 divided doses for 60 days (BIII) with most experts recommending a daily maximum of 300 mg, or nifurtimox (Lampit®) 8–10 mg/kg/day PO in 3 divided doses for 60 days (BIII). Efficacy of both therapies is suboptimal, and treated patients are still at risk of reactivation.

### Early assessment of antibodies decline in Chagas patients following treatment using a serological multiplex immunoassay [^169f57e9]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Great progress has been made in epitope and serological biomarkers research. Moreover, high-performance serology tests were developed with overall high sensitivity and specificity, though field performance varies. Therefore, the WHO recommends using two serological tests to diagnose chronic infection, which can lead to underdiagnosis due to discordant results. There is an urgent need for serology tests and other markers or combinations thereof that can be used to assess drug efficacy in a timely manner. This would allow for appropriate development timelines of new drugs, the follow-up and interpretation of clinical trial data, and the improved care / counselling of patients through the assessment of cure soon after therapy.

The MultiCruzi assay, a multiplex antibody serology test, has proven effective in confirming Chagas disease and predicting parasitological cure earlier than conventional tests in infants and children with acute or early chronic Chagas disease –. This study aims to apply the MultiCruzi method to adults with chronic Chagas disease, using serial dilutions and advanced statistical analytical methods to identify response to treatment early during follow-up.

### Early assessment of antibodies decline in Chagas patients following treatment using a serological multiplex immunoassay [^a9592ed0]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Chagas disease following infection with Trypanosoma cruzi is a major public health issue, with the disease spreading beyond endemic regions and becoming more global due to the migration of infected individuals. The currently available anti-parasitic drugs, nifurtimox and benznidazole, remain insufficiently evaluated for their efficacy in adult patients. A key challenge is the lack of markers for parasitological cure, which also precludes the development of new treatments. Consequently, there is a critical need for a practical method to assess drug performance within a short timeframe. In this retrospective analysis of the phase 2 randomized controlled BENDITA trial (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03378661), we report the potential of a serological multiplex method (MultiCruzi), combined with advanced statistical analytical methods, to measure the response to anti-parasitic treatment of adult Chagas patients. Applying this approach to serum samples from adult patients in the indeterminate chronic stage of Chagas disease, treated with different benznidazole regimens and combinations, we predict treatment efficacy after just 6months of follow-up, in sharp contrast to data obtained with conventional and recombinant T. cruzi ELISA tests. The obtained results are also compared with the PCR data. We propose integrating MultiCruzi as a serological method endpoint in proof-of-concept clinical trials for Chagas disease.

### Serological diagnosis of chronic Chagas disease: is It time for a change? [^88e5c66b]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2016). Low credibility.

Chagas disease has spread to areas that are nonendemic for the disease with human migration. Since no single reference standard test is available, serological diagnosis of chronic Chagas disease requires at least two tests. New-generation techniques have significantly improved the accuracy of Chagas disease diagnosis by the use of a large mixture of recombinant antigens with different detection systems, such as chemiluminescence. The aim of the present study was to assess the overall accuracy of a new-generation kit, the Architect Chagas (cutoff, ≥1 sample relative light units/cutoff value [S/CO]), as a single technique for the diagnosis of chronic Chagas disease. The Architect Chagas showed a sensitivity of 100% (95% confidence interval [CI], 99.5 to 100%) and a specificity of 97.6% (95% CI, 95.2 to 99.9%). Five out of six false-positive serum samples were a consequence of cross-reactivity with Leishmania spp., and all of them achieved results of <5 S/CO. We propose the Architect Chagas as a single technique for screening in blood banks and for routine diagnosis in clinical laboratories. Only gray-zone and positive sera with a result of ≤6 S/CO would need to be confirmed by a second serological assay, thus avoiding false-positive sera and the problem of cross-reactivity with Leishmania species. The application of this proposal would result in important savings in the cost of Chagas disease diagnosis and therefore in the management and control of the disease.

INTRODUCTION

Chagas disease (American trypanosomiasis) is caused by the flagellate protozoanand affects 6 million to 7 million people worldwide, mainly in Latin America. Vector-borne transmission via insects of the subfamilyoccurs in the Americas; however, infection can also be transmitted congenitally and via blood transfusion, organ transplantation, and the ingestion of food/beverages contaminated with parasites. Although it mainly affects individuals living in regions of endemicity, the disease has now spread to other regions and continents.

The infection is characterized by an acute, often asymptomatic stage lasting 8 to 12 weeks, when active parasitemia is evident. During this stage, diagnosis can be performed by direct microscopy of blood for circulating parasites or via PCR. The infection subsequently enters a chronic phase, and the majority of individuals remain asymptomatic. However, up to 30% of individuals will develop Chagas cardiomyopathy over decades, and up to 10% will develop gastrointestinal, neurological, or oligosymptomatic alterations that require treatment ; these pathologies typically develop over years to decades. Generally, in the chronic phase of infection, the management of specific symptoms/conditions is necessary. The availability of curative treatment is a controversial topic; the WHO recommends treatment of adults with antiparasitic drugs to prevent disease progression and congenital transmission in pregnant women.

### Chagas disease and domestic medical screening guidance for newly arrived individuals under a humanitarian-based immigration status: a call for action [^64547f14]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2022). Medium credibility.

Screening migrants who may have acquired T. cruzi infection prior to or during migration represents an opportunity to provide timely treatment. Anti-trypanosomal therapy is effective during acute and early chronic forms of Chagas disease.However, untreated Chagas disease can lead to a 5% annual risk of chronic cardiomyopathy.Early identification of congenitally infected neonates is important because the treatment success rate surpasses 90% in this patient population.In the United States, screening for congenital Chagas disease is cost-effective for rates of congenital transmission ≥ 0.001% and for all levels of maternal prevalence ≥ 0.06%.

Despite strong progress in the control of Chagas disease in Latin America, the United States is currently home to more people with T. cruzi infection (> 300,000) than 16 of 21 Latin American endemic countries. Nonetheless, < 1% of those with the disease have accessed diagnosis or treatment because of numerous barriers, and health-care providers are often unaware of who is at risk. – Although screening for T. cruzi infection with serological assays is a critical U.S. public health intervention among immigrants from Chagas-endemic settings, there is an urgent need to consider screening recently arrived refugees, asylum seekers, and other migrant persons, including extracontinental migrants from nonendemic countries in Africa, Asia, and the Caribbean who have spent prolonged periods in highly endemic areas in Latin America (Figure 1). Nonendemic countries with fewer T. cruzi –infected individuals than the United States have included recommendations for T. cruzi screening in their national guidelines,and recommendations for screening and diagnosis of Chagas disease in the United States were recently published.We urge consideration of Chagas disease in the Guidance for the U.S. Domestic Medical Examination for Newly Arriving Refugees. This could provide an important gateway to understanding more fully the risk and burden of this neglected disease in a vulnerable population that faces unique health-care access challenges and leads to more widespread screening of high-risk groups beyond this context. Moreover, ensuring timely diagnosis and treatment can help prevent future congenital transmission and progression to more severe disease. Ultimately, a comprehensive public health approach in which screening and care is available to all people at risk of Chagas disease is key to achieving the goals in the WHO’s 2030 neglected tropical diseases road map.

INTRODUCTION

Chagas disease (CD), a life-threatening condition arising from the hemoflagellated protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, represents a major health problem in Latin America.This disease affects more than five million people in 21 Latin American countries.In Brazil alone, 4.6 million people were estimated to be infected in 2014.During recent decades, an increasing number of cases in the non-endemic countries of North America,Europe,Asia,and Oceania, have been described. Despite successes in vector eradication and blood donor–screening programs funded by large-scale multinational initiatives,the incidence of CD continues to increase in areas that lack control measures. Considering the fact that CD is characterized by a prolonged asymptomatic phase and that most affected individuals reside in peri-urban slums or rural areas, improvements in measures to control and prevent CD must be made. Because most chagasic (Ch) individuals in the ongoing chronic phase are never tested and remain unaware of their condition, it is essential to develop accurate CD diagnostic tools for use both in routine health services and at blood centers. Laboratory diagnostic techniques are dependent on illness stage and clinical symptoms. During the acute phase, direct microscopic observation of trypomastigote forms is the preferred method to affirm diagnosis as a result of high parasite load in the blood. In this phase, indirect serological methodologies present low sensitivity due to a delayed humoral immune response.Symptoms present rarely or are unspecific, including fever and an occasional inflammatory reaction at the infection site.

Chagas disease (T. cruzi) during pregnancy—screening and prevalence: Screening of pregnant women who have lived in endemic areas should be considered to identify maternal infection and possible risk of infection in their offspring. In pregnant women in areas where the disease is endemic in Latin America, the seroprevalence of T. cruzi infection can be as high as 30%, and in the United States a 1999 study of 3,765 pregnant women in Houston, Texas, confirmed antibody to T. cruzi in 0.4% of Hispanic women.

### Evaluation of the elecsys Chagas assay for detection of trypanosoma cruzi-specific antibodies in a multicenter study in Europe and Latin America [^e777b559]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2018). Low credibility.

Importantly, chronically infected individuals represent a substantial population capable of transmitting the infection, particularly through blood or organ donation or from mother to child. During the chronic phase, individuals exhibit low-level or no parasitemia, and thus, direct microscopy is inappropriate. PCR detects the parasite in 40 to 65% of patients with chronic disease ; consequently, diagnosis relies upon the detection ofantibodies by serological methods.

The most commonly used serological methods are enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunofluorescence indirect test (IFI) ; a few automated systems based on chemiluminescence have been introduced. The diagnostic approach to Chagas disease is heterogeneous, with guidelines varying according to location (i.e. laboratory, region, or country) and purpose (i.e. screening of blood/organ donors versus diagnosis of patients with symptomatic disease). Conventional tests based on total antigens show cross-reactivity betweenandspp. or; therefore, confirmation of the presence ofantibodies commonly requires the use of at least two tests that are based on different methods/antigens. Furthermore, the resolution algorithms (i.e. sequence, type, and number of tests used) also vary by region. However, with the availability of assays with improved sensitivity and specificity, it has been suggested that a single assay may now be adequate for screening and diagnosis.

The primary aim of this study was to assess the relative sensitivity and specificity of the fully automated Elecsys Chagas assay in comparison with those of other state-of-the-artantibody assays. Secondary aims were the evaluation of analytical specificity and analytical sensitivity at the cutoff (CO) in dilution series against WHO standards.

Although we set out to demonstrate the success of an in-hospital screening algorithm for CD, our challenges demonstrate the limitations of our current approach. Our research highlights the need for improved availability and quality of screening tests. In addition, research is needed on factors that impact willingness to participate in screening and how to best reach at-risk populations, perhaps by combining screening programs for CD with screening for more common conditions to maximize screening and benefit to patients. Globally, CD remains an underlying public health challenge, and future research should aim to identify effective strategies in non-endemic countries for capturing patients before disease progression and irreversible health consequences.

Should Women of Childbearing Age From Latin America be Screened?

Recommendation.

1. Screening women of childbearing age who have lived in a region of Mexico, South or Central America with endemic CD can effectively identify cases and prevent congenital transmission of the disease (strong, moderate).

Congenital transmission of CD from infected mother to unborn child is a potentially important mode of disease transmission in the United States. Several US surveys in pregnant women from high-risk groups have shown a substantial prevalence of T. cruzi infection (Table 4). From a public health perspective, treatment of women before pregnancy can prevent congenital transmission and provide health benefits for the mother. Targeted and universal screening for CD in US mothers is cost-saving for all rates of congenital transmission >0.001% and all levels of maternal prevalence >0.06%, compared with no screening.

Current diagnosis of chronic Chagas disease relies on serologic detection of specific immunoglobulin G against Trypanosoma cruzi. However, the presence of parasites detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in patients without positive conventional serologic testing has been observed. We determined the prevalence and clinical characteristics of persons with seronegative results for T. cruzi DNA detected by PCR in a population at high risk for chronic American trypanosomiasis. We studied a total of 194 persons from two different populations: 110 patients were recruited from an urban cardiology clinic, and 84 persons were nonselected citizens from a highly disease-endemic area. Eighty (41%) of persons had negative serologic findings; 12 (15%) had a positive PCR. Three patients with negative serologic findings and positive PCR results had clinical signs and symptoms that suggested Chagas cardiomyopathy. This finding challenges the current recommendations for Chagas disease diagnosis, therapy, and blood transfusion policies.

### Serodiscordance in chronic Chagas disease diagnosis: a real problem in non-endemic countries [^4de677c5]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2016). Low credibility.

According to the WHO, chronic Chagas disease (CD) diagnosis is based on two serological techniques. To establish a definitive diagnosis, the results must be concordant. In cases of discordances, the WHO proposes repeating serology in a new sample, and if results remain inconclusive, a confirmatory test should be performed. This study, conducted at two Tropical Medicine Units in Europe over 4 years, aims to assess the diagnostic yield of TESA- (trypomastigote excreted-secreted antigens) blot as a confirmatory technique in patients with inconclusive and discordant results. Of 4939 individuals screened, 1124 (22.7%) obtained positive results and 165 (3.3%) discordant results. Serology was repeated in 88/165 sera and discrepancies were solved in 25/88 (28.4%) cases. Patients without a definitive diagnosis were classified in two different groups: Group 1, including patients with inconclusive results despite retesting (n = 63), and Group 2, including patients with discordant results not retested (n = 77). TESA-blot was performed for all of Group 1 and 39/77 of Group 2 and was positive for 33/63 (52.4%) and 21/39 (53.8%), respectively. Analysis of Group 1 results showed a moderate agreement between results of the ELISA based on native antigen and TESA-blot (κ 0.53). In contrast, a clear disagreement was observed between the ELISA based on recombinant antigens and TESA-blot (κ <0). A sizeable proportion of patients are suspected to have CD with inconclusive results or in whom re-testing is not feasible. TESA-blot was positive in half of these patients, highlighting the need for a confirmatory assay in European centres caring for exposed individuals.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Chagas disease in HIV—diagnosis and detection of re-activation are based on direct parasitologic evidence and targeted laboratory methods. A definitive diagnosis of re-activation is established by identification of the parasite or its products in tissue, CSF, or blood; in an HIV–T. cruzi co-infected patient, circulating parasites suggest reactivation and the need for treatment, and blood concentration techniques such as capillary centrifugation can improve sensitivity, with trypomastigotes located just above the buffy coat. Hemoculture is somewhat more sensitive than direct methods but takes 2 to 8 weeks to demonstrate parasites. Conventional PCR is not useful for diagnosing re-activation, whereas quantitative PCR assays (real-time PCR) performed on serial blood specimens showing rising parasite numbers over time provide the earliest and most sensitive indicator of reactivation; few data exist on PCR of CSF, but it would be expected to have high sensitivity for reactivation in the CNS.

### Chagas disease, an endemic disease in the United States [^5446eb5b]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Texas has undertaken extensive efforts to document human Chagas disease; cases were first made reportable in the state in 2013. The first known autochthonous case of human Chagas disease in the United States occurred in an infant in 1955 in Corpus Christi, Texas, in a home known to be infested with triatomines. However, parasite transmission to humans in the region has occurred since prehistoric times, given, for example, a paleoparasitology study that recovered T. cruzi DNA in a mummified body (dated to 1,150 BP) of a man from western Texas with signs of megacolon. During 2013–2023, the Texas Department of State Health Services documented 50 probable and confirmed cases that were considered autochthonous, either because the area of vector exposure was known or because of a lack of travel to or previous residence in Chagas disease–endemic areas of Latin America (Figure 2 ; Appendix). Of those 50 cases, 3 were diagnosed at the acute stage, 44 at the chronic asymptomatic (indeterminate) stage, and 3 at the chronic symptomatic (determinate) stage. Based on CDC guidelines, diagnosis of chronic Chagas disease requires positive results by > 2 tests that detect antibodies to different antigens, because no single test is sufficiently sensitive and specific for diagnosis. Of the 47 reported chronic cases, 31 (66%) were confirmed with serologic testing at CDC. Of the 3 acute cases, 2 were acquired in central Texas (Austin–Round Rock metropolitan area); the third case was acquired in the Rio Grande Valley region of South Texas. A Spearman correlation test indicated that there was no temporal trend in the reported cases by year (z-score −1.0004; p = 0.31), underscoring that locally acquired cases are a stable threat in the state.

INTRODUCTION

Chagas disease is a neglected tropical disease caused by the protozoan parasite. It is transmitted principally by hematophagous triatomine bugs, although congenital and oral transmissions are gaining importance. Infection leads to chronic cardiac disease in 30 to 40% of patients, eventually causing cardiac failure. Digestive forms of the disease may also develop. The disease affects 6 to 10 million persons, mostly in the Americas, where vectorial transmission is endemic, and is associated with health care costs of over $24 billion.

The identification of infected patients is critical to ensure early treatment and care, as the efficacy of available drugs decreases when the infection becomes more chronic. It is also critical for the screening of blood donors, to avoid transfusion-associated transmission, and for the screening of pregnant women, to identify those at risk of congenital transmission. Finally, it is essential for global disease surveillance to evaluate disease burden. Since most infected persons are chronically infected, diagnosis is mostly based on serological tests that detect circulating antibodies against the parasite. Multiple tests have been developed over the years, often based on enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) platforms and multiple antigens, ranging from crude parasite lysates/extracts to purified antigens or selected recombinant proteins. Several rapid tests based on recombinant proteins and immunochromatographic platforms have also been developed. While most tests are thought to have high sensitivity and specificity, their actual performance may be overestimated. Thus, current recommendations require a positive reaction with two distinct serological tests for a confirmed diagnosis ofinfection. In case of discordance between the tests, a third test needs to be performed. This complicates diagnostic algorithms and can severely delay the identification of cases and their adequate care.

Furthermore, variations in test performance among regions and countries have been reported before, particularly in Mexico. A recent assessment of test performance among U.S. blood donors indicated that for all tests evaluated, antibody reactivity and clinical sensitivity were lowest in donors from Mexico, intermediate in those from Central America, and highest in those from South America, although minimum sensitivity reached at least 82.6%. In a previous study, we screened pregnant women forinfection in a large multicentric study in Argentina, Honduras, and Mexico to assess congenital transmission. Among 28,145 women screened with two rapid tests, we identified 495 with at least one reactive rapid test, of which 347 (70%) were confirmed by ELISA. Again, discordant serology seemed to be more important in samples from Mexico than Argentina.

### Chagas disease and domestic medical screening guidance for newly arrived individuals under a humanitarian-based immigration status: a call for action [^a999d595]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2022). Medium credibility.

Chagas disease is considered one of the most important neglected tropical diseases in the Western Hemisphere, given its morbidity, mortality, and societal and economic burden. The United States has the fifth highest global burden of Chagas disease. Every year, thousands of migrant people from Latin America and throughout the globe travel to the U.S.- Mexico border searching for asylum. The U.S. CDC's Guidance for the U.S. Domestic Medical Examination for Newly Arriving Refugees provides recommendations to safeguard the health of individuals who enter the United States with a humanitarian-based immigration status as defined by the CDC's guidance under Key Considerations and Best Practices. We encourage the inclusion of Trypanosoma cruzi infection screening recommendations in this guidance as an important step toward understanding the risk and burden of Chagas disease in this vulnerable population, strengthening their access to care and contributing to the 2030 objectives of the WHO's neglected tropical diseases road map.

RESULTS

Who Should be Screened for Chagas Disease in the United States?

Are There Populations at Risk That Should be Screened?

Recommendations.

1. Screening people who were born or lived for a prolonged period (>6 months) in areas of Mexico, Central or South America with endemic CD can effectively identify new cases (strong, low) (Table 2).

Table 2. 
Recommendations for Screening and Diagnosis of Chagas Disease in the United States

Within the US population, people who were born or lived for a prolonged period in areas with endemic CD in Mexico, Central, or South America are at greatest risk of T. cruzi infection (Table 3). One community-based study of over 4000 Latin-American born immigrants living in Los Angeles showed a seroprevalence of 1.24%. Among people who were born or lived for a prolonged period in Latin America, the seroprevalence has been higher still in those with evidence of characteristic findings on electrocardiogram (ECG) including bundle-branch blocks, nonischemic cardiomyopathy, or pacemaker placement. This supports the assertion that screening people who were born or lived for a prolonged period in areas with endemic CD—Mexico and Central and South America—is a viable approach to identifying new cases. Generally, people will need to be screened even though they do not exhibit visible signs or symptoms of CD.

Table 3. 
Studies on Prevalence of Chagas Disease in Latin American-Born Populations in the United States (2010–2020) a

2. Screening close (first-degree) relatives of people previously diagnosed with CD can effectively identify new cases (strong, low).

Limited evidence shows a substantial prevalence of T. cruzi infection among close relatives of people previously diagnosed with CD. A Los Angeles study found a prevalence of 7.4% among family members of CD patients. Screening the relatives of people who have been previously diagnosed with the disease is another way to identify individuals with CD. When a patient is confirmed positive, healthcare providers should encourage the patient to advise family members to seek testing. (Contact information for US providers with expertise in CD can be found at).

3. Screening people with documented exposure to triatomines in states with known presence of triatomine species capable of transmitting T. cruzi (conditional, low).

Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Heart failure diagnostic evaluation—laboratory testing and natriuretic peptides: Thyroid-function tests should be measured; a fasting transferrin saturation is useful to screen for hemochromatosis and magnetic resonance imaging may be needed to confirm iron overload; screening for human immunodeficiency virus should be considered in patients who are at high risk; assays for connective tissue diseases and for pheochromocytoma should be performed if suspected; and serum titers of Chagas disease antibodies should be checked in nonischemic cardiomyopathy with travel or immigration from an endemic region. Elevated plasma B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels have been associated with reduced LVEF, LVH, elevated LV filling pressures, and acute MI and ischemia and are sensitive to age, sex, weight, and renal function; elevated levels lend support to a diagnosis of abnormal ventricular function or hemodynamics causing symptomatic heart failure. Trials suggest utility in the urgent-care setting to differentiate dyspnea due to heart failure from other causes and suggest that use may reduce both the time to hospital discharge and the cost of treatment, but BNP levels tend to be less elevated in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction than in heart failure with low ejection fraction, are lower in obese patients, and may be elevated meaningfully in women and in people over 60 years of age who do not have heart failure; elevations may lend weight to a suspected diagnosis or trigger consideration of heart failure when unknown but should not be used in isolation to confirm or exclude the presence of heart failure.

### Evaluation of the performance of ortho T. cruzi ELISA test system for the detection of antibodies to trypanosoma cruzi [^7ca10837]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2022). Medium credibility.

The serologic diagnosis of chronic Chagas disease, caused by infection with the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, is challenging and lacks a gold-standard assay. To overcome the problem, CDC uses an algorithm that uses two tests on different platforms and applies a third test as a tiebreaker. The Ortho T. cruzi ELISA Test System from Ortho Diagnostics was cleared by FDA for clinical diagnosis usage. We evaluated this test against the CDC algorithm for chronic Chagas disease. We tested several sets of serum specimens: 104 specimens tested positive for T. cruzi specific antibody and 283 (including 30 specimens positive for antibody to Leishmania spp.) tested negative based on the current CDC chronic T. cruzi infection diagnostic testing algorithm. Concordance of the Ortho T. cruzi ELISA Test System with the CDC algorithm result was 90% (95% CI 87 to 93%) overall and 92% (95% CI 89 to 95%) when excluding Leishmania spp. antibody positive specimens. The cross-reactivity of the Ortho T. cruzi ELISA Test System was 37% to Leishmania spp. serologically positive specimens, 1% to specimens from patients diagnosed with other parasitic infections, and 0% against specimens from a US noninfected population. In conclusion, the Ortho T. cruzi ELISA Test System compares well against the CDC diagnostic algorithm for chronic Chagas disease. The availability of this FDA-cleared assay will improve the chronic Chagas disease diagnosis.

### Chronic Chagas disease diagnosis: a comparative performance of commercial enzyme immunoassay tests [^aba58cdb]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2016). Low credibility.

There is a significant heterogeneity in reported performance of serological assays for Chagas disease diagnosis. The conventional serology testing in laboratory diagnosis and in blood banks is unsatisfactory because of a high number of inconclusive and misclassified results. We aimed to assess the quality of four commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay tests for their ability to detect Trypanosoma cruzi antibodies in 685 sera samples. Cross-reactivity was assessed by using 748 sera from patients with unrelated diseases. Initially, we found that the reactivity index against T. cruzi antigen was statistically higher in sera from Chagas disease patients compared with those from non-chagasic patients, supporting the notion that all evaluated tests have a good discriminatory ability toward the diagnosis of T. cruzi infection in patients in the chronic phase of the disease. Although all tests were similarly sensitive for diagnosing T. cruzi infection, there were significant variations in terms of specificity and cross-reactivity among them. Indeed, we obtained divergent results when testing sera from patient with unrelated diseases, particularly leishmaniasis, with the levels of cross-reactivity being higher in tests using whole T. cruzi extracts compared with those using recombinant proteins. Our data suggest that all four tests may be used for the laboratory diagnosis and routine blood screening diagnose for Chagas disease. We also emphasize that, despite their general good performance, caution is needed when analyzing the results when these tests are performed in areas where other diseases, particularly leishmaniasis, are endemic.

Nonetheless, as noted before, a key issue in assessing test performance is the lack of a gold standard for the serological diagnosis ofinfection, so that sensitivity of tests is usually determined using samples that are strongly reactive in multiple serological tests, and discordant samples are considered false positives and often discarded from analyses. To overcome this limitation, we aimed to measure the reactivity of commercial serological tests using a unique cohort of samples with at least one positivePCR and, thus, can be considered true infection cases.

Serologic tests cannot be used to assess the response to treatment, and antileishmanial antibodies can be detected years after clinically successful therapy in some persons (strong, moderate). For cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL), serologic testing is not recommended as part of the diagnostic evaluation; the currently available serologic assays are neither sensitive nor specific for the diagnosis of CL (strong, moderate).

### Rapid high-sensitivity detection of antibodies to trypanosoma cruzi with a recombinant Tc24 antigen-based magneto-immunoassay: a pilot study [^c74ba333]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Chagas disease (CD), or American trypanosomiasis, is a neglected tropical disease caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi that affects approximately 6 to 7 million people worldwide, mostly in Latin America. CD has acute and chronic phases, both of which can have subclinical symptoms, complicating clinical diagnosis. If left untreated, acute infection progresses to the chronic indeterminate phase, in which ∼30% of patients develop life-threatening complications, including cardiac (cardiomyopathy, heart failure, cardiac arrest) or gastrointestinal conditions (megaesophagus, megacolon).

Methods for diagnosing acute CD include microscopic identification of T cruzi in blood smears or the detection of T cruzi DNA with nucleic acid–based tests. During the chronic phase, the level of parasitemia drops below the limit of detection of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)–based tests, resulting in low sensitivity. Thus, the diagnosis of chronic infection relies mainly on serologic assays, such as indirect immunofluorescence, indirect hemagglutination, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). There are currently four Food and Drug Administration–cleared serologic tests for the detection of chronic CD, which use crude parasitic antigens or a combination of recombinant antigens. However, the accuracy of these and other tests is highly variable for the detection of different T cruzi discrete typing unit (DTU) subtypes. For example, one study found that commercial Chagas tests missed up to 12% of Chagas-seropositive cases from Argentina and up to 70% of the cases from Mexico, demonstrating the geographic variability of test performance. Additionally, the results of 2 independent tests can be discordant. For these reasons, the current World Health Organization recommendations include using at least 2 serologic tests to confirm the diagnosis of chronic CD, leading to significant delays in diagnosis and excessive resource burden on the health care system.

### Accuracy of practitioner estimates of probability of diagnosis before and after testing (...) [^2aa06c54]. JAMA Network (2021). Excellent credibility.

A, Scenario: a previously healthy 35-year-old woman who smokes tobacco presents with 5 days of fatigue, productive cough, worsening shortness of breath, temperatures to 38. 9°C, and decreased breath sounds in the lower right field. She has a heart rate of 105 beats/min, but vital signs are otherwise normal. B, Scenario: a 45-year-old woman comes in for an annual visit. She has no specific risk factors or symptoms for breast cancer. C, Scenario: a 43-year-old premenopausal woman presents with atypical chest pain and normal ECG results. She has no risk factors and has normal vital signs and examination findings. D, Scenario: a 65-year-old man is seen for osteoarthritis. He has noted foul-smelling urine and no pain or difficulty with urination. A urine dipstick shows trace blood. ECG indicates electrocardiography. Estimates of probability of disease were consistently higher than scientific evidence.

We also broke down answers by type of practitioner. All types of practitioners overestimated probability of disease before and after testing. After a positive test result, 432 would treat for cardiac ischemia. For UTI, the description was of asymptomatic bacteriuria. The median clinical scenario–based estimate of pretest probability by participants was 20%. . Estimates of probability and imputed likelihood ratios were similar between residents and primary care practitioners. Such cognitive biases have been associated with diagnostic errors that may occur from errors in estimating risk. 5, 22, 23 Notably, practitioners in this survey were often residents or academic physicians who often practice with populations with higher prevalence of disease.

This experience may have also contributed to higher estimates of disease. Pretest probabilities were consistently overestimated for all questions, but overestimates were particularly apparent for the pneumonia and UTI scenarios. Estimates of pretest probability generally reflect clinical knowledge. Reasons for overestimates for these infectious diseases may relate to the fact that antibiotics are often appropriately given even when the likelihood of infection is moderate. In the UTI scenario, estimates of high pretest probability may reflect the evolution of the definition of asymptomatic bacteriuria as a separate entity from UTI. 24.

### Autochthonous Chagas disease-Missouri, 2018 [^8067b362]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2020). Medium credibility.

Blood donor screening for T. cruzi antibodies in the U.S. blood supply was first implemented in 2007. Positive results from blood donor screening for T. cruzi antibodies should be followed by diagnostic testing. Diagnosis of chronic Chagas disease is based on positive results from at least two serologic tests that use different techniques and different antigen preparations because no single test is sufficiently sensitive and specific for diagnosis. * Commonly used techniques include ELISA using recombinant antigens, TESA, and IFA. This patient’s results were positive with EIA and negative with TESA. CDC’s testing algorithm employs a third test when results of the first two tests are discordant. In the Missouri patient, the IFA result was positive for T. cruzi antibody. Based on the patient’s testing results, history and presentation, this patient likely represents the first documented autochthonous case of Chagas disease in Missouri.

Most persons with Chagas disease acquired their infection in the parts of Latin America where Chagas disease is endemic. Currently, more than a century after its discovery in Latin America, Chagas disease has a global distribution including the United States because of migration from areas with endemic disease. Few cases of locally acquired vectorborne infection have been reported in the United States. The likely autochthonous case described in this report underscores importance of health care provider awareness of possible Chagas disease even in the states considered low risk for this infection and need for the careful consideration of the patient’s history to identify possible risks for T. cruzi infection.

Heart transplant—Chagas disease (Trypanosoma cruzi) donor/recipient screening: Screening is prioritized for epidemiologic risk groups, with the text stating it is “important for residents of, immigrants from or travelers to endemic areas (21 Latin/South America countries).” Global burden estimates highlight impact, “with over 300,000 infected persons estimated to be living in the United States and over 80,000 in Europe.” Due to vertical transmission risk, “donors whose mothers are at risk for Chagas disease should also be tested.” In potential donors, “Asymptomatic parasitemia is more common than symptomatic disease,” antibodies indicate exposure and current infection unless treated, and while PCR/Strout can detect acute parasitemia, they are “generally not sufficiently sensitive for screening… because of intermittent parasitemia.” Therefore, “For screening purposes, serology with validated antibody assays must be used.”

Chronic Chagas disease—staging and monitoring in silent or asymptomatic phases note that stages A and B are silent or asymptomatic and can last for many years or decades, and in most patients the disease never progresses to the more advanced symptomatic stages C and D; the clinically indeterminate phase is defined by at least two positive serologic tests or a positive direct demonstration of the parasite in blood or tissue and the absence of signs and symptoms of ChD; more than two thirds of T. cruzi–infected individuals remain in the clinically indeterminate phase throughout their lives; conversion to chronic Chagas heart disease (ChHD) with new ECG abnormalities or definite cardiomyopathy has been reported at rates of 1.8% to 5% per year, which may be higher with more sensitive imaging such as advanced echocardiography (strain) or cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR); echocardiography has been the traditional modality of choice for ChD.

Although TST can be performed, IGRA may be preferred in children with previous exposure to Bacillus Calmette–Guérin vaccine and in people in whom follow-up with TST reading is questionable. For children adopted internationally, consider repeating this testing after 6 mo to rule out exposure just before leaving the country of origin. In children from countries with endemic infection, T cruzi serological testing is listed.

Chagas disease—diagnosis, clinical phases, staging, and imaging: The diagnosis of ChD is made by epidemiologic history and by two or more positive serologic tests, and there are two clinical phases of T. cruzi infection (acute and chronic). About 70% to 80% of individuals with chronic T. cruzi infection remain asymptomatic (indeterminate form), while 20% to 30% develop cardiac and/or gastrointestinal disease. Patients with chronic Chagas heart disease are staged according to the severity of myocardial damage and symptoms of congestive heart failure (HF). Assessments by electrocardiography is mandatory because the earliest signs of ChHD are generally conduction system defects and/or ventricular arrhythmias. Cardiac imaging modalities such as echocardiography, nuclear medicine, computed tomography (CT), cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR), and chest radiography provide valuable information on cardiac structure and function, and the document’s purpose is to provide recommendations for the use of cardiac ultrasound and other imaging modalities in the diagnosis, classification, and risk assessment of myocardial damage from early to advanced forms of ChHD.

Diagnosis and treatment

The diagnosis is usually made by detecting in the patient’s blood either the parasite or antibodies against it, where PCR is the most useful technique, especially in infected patients with borderline serology not detected by other methods.

During the acute phase of Chagas disease, anti-Chagas drugs such as benzinidazole and nifurtimox may heal the disease. Unfortunately, once the disease reaches its chronic phase, antiparasitic drugs will not be able to cure it definitely, and treatment will be based on trying to palliate specific chronic conditions such as the cardiac or gastrointestinal affections.

### Chagas disease serological test performance in U.S. blood donor specimens [^37d52287]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2019). Medium credibility.

In the chronic phase, confirmed diagnosis requires positive results by two serological tests for IgG antibodies to, preferably based on different antigens. Currently, four serological assays, namely, the Orthoenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (Ortho Clinical Diagnostics, Raritan, NJ), Hemagen Chagas’ kit ELISA (Hemagen Diagnostics, Inc. Columbia, MD), Wiener Chagatest Recombinante v.3.0 ELISA (Wiener Laboratories, Rosario, Argentina), and InBios Chagas Detect Plus (CDP) rapid test (InBios International, Inc, Seattle, WA), are cleared by the FDA for diagnostic use. The Ortho and Hemagen ELISAs are based on native parasite proteins. The other two assays are based on recombinant proteins. The Wiener ELISA uses trypomastigote-shed acute-phase antigens (SAPA) and recombinant epimastigote antigens 1, 2, 13, 30, and 36. The InBios test is based on the recombinant multiepitope fusion antigen ITC8.2. All four assays report high sensitivity and specificity in their FDA 510(k) clearance applications (reported percent sensitivity/specificity: Ortho, 98.9/99.99; Hemagen, 100/98.7; Wiener, 99.3/98.7; InBios, 95 to 100/87 to 98). However, comparative performance data are lacking for at-risk populations in the United States, as well as for those in Mexico and Central America, the predominant regions of origin of U.S. immigrants. Emerging evidence suggests variation in test sensitivity by geographic location and a high rate of discordance between serological test results, particularly in Mexico. Comprehensive studies are needed to provide the basis for development of reliable testing algorithms. In this study, we compared the performances of the four FDA-cleared serological tests in specimens from U.S. blood donors to provide the first systematic evidence to improve laboratory diagnosis of Chagas disease in the United States.
