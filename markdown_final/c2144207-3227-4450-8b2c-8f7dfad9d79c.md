## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about treating Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI), including definitions, first-episode management, first recurrence strategies, multiple recurrences, special populations, monitoring, and cost-effectiveness considerations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining recurrence and establishing baseline risk. Then, I should verify first-line therapy for an initial episode and why fidaxomicin is preferred. Next, I will examine options for a first recurrence and how prior therapy and patient risk shape choices. After that, I need to evaluate strategies for multiple recurrences, including FMT and microbiome therapeutics. Finally, I should review adjuncts like bezlotoxumab, special populations, follow-up and monitoring, and synthesize a practical algorithm while checking for cost-effectiveness data and controversies.

> Let me first confirm the clinical framework and definitions so I don't anchor incorrectly. Recurrent CDI is generally defined as the return of clinically significant diarrhea with confirmatory testing within 8 weeks of completing treatment for a prior episode, with the caveat that symptoms should improve with C. difficile–directed therapy to distinguish recurrence from alternative etiologies; importantly, risk escalates with each episode, approximating 20–25% after the first and 40–60% after subsequent episodes, so recurrence risk becomes a key driver of strategy rather than severity alone [^111Rfr6P] [^113bv8ST] [^113ue2qN].

> Now, for the initial episode, I need to check current first-line therapy. Fidaxomicin 200 mg orally twice daily for 10 days is preferred across modern guidelines because it achieves similar initial cure but significantly lowers recurrence versus vancomycin, with metronidazole no longer recommended as first-line when fidaxomicin or vancomycin are available; if fidaxomicin is not accessible, vancomycin 125 mg four times daily for 10 days is an appropriate alternative, reserving metronidazole for select low-risk or resource-limited settings only [^116LPUD8] [^113ue2qN] [^111hwoKq] [^116DeuNS].

> Wait, let me verify the evidence base behind fidaxomicin's superiority on sustained outcomes. Meta-analytic data show lower recurrence with fidaxomicin versus vancomycin among those initially cured, supporting sustained clinical response as a key endpoint, and IDSA/SHEA explicitly judged the balance of benefits and harms favoring fidaxomicin over vancomycin for initial therapy, acknowledging moderate certainty of evidence and likely cost-effectiveness when downstream recurrences are considered [^111AaDp8] [^116DeuNS].

> Hold on, I should also confirm that metronidazole's diminished role is consistent with efficacy signals. Trials and guideline appraisals show higher treatment failure with metronidazole compared with vancomycin, reinforcing its demotion from first-line status, though it may still be considered in low-risk initial nonsevere cases when first-line agents are unavailable or contraindicated, which I should note cautiously to avoid overgeneralization [^111AaDp8] [^116LPUD8].

> For a first recurrence, I will now examine the two main strategies and ensure I match them to prior therapy and risk. Strategy A is fidaxomicin 200 mg twice daily for 10 days, which is guideline-preferred and associated with superior sustained response versus vancomycin in this setting; Strategy B is a tapered and pulsed vancomycin regimen (for example, 125 mg four times daily for 10–14 days, then 125 mg twice daily for 7 days, then 125 mg once daily for 7 days, then 125 mg every 2–3 days for 2–8 weeks), which is reasonable particularly if the index episode was treated with vancomycin or metronidazole [^116gZZ47] [^113DfF86] [^117RYFan].

> But wait, what if the patient is high risk for recurrence at the time of first recurrence? I should confirm when to add bezlotoxumab. The human monoclonal antibody against toxin B reduces recurrence risk, with the greatest absolute benefit in patients with multiple risk factors such as age ≥ 65, immunocompromise, severe CDI, or recent CDI; IDSA/SHEA and ACG suggest adding bezlotoxumab to standard-of-care antibiotics in high-risk patients, though cost and cardiovascular cautions in CHF should be weighed carefully [^1133nP7L] [^1124WVQL] [^113jpiTE].

> Next, I should review what to do after a second or further recurrence, because recurrence risk exceeds 40% and cumulative microbiome injury drives failures. FMT is strongly recommended after standard antibiotics for multiple recurrences, with colonoscopy or capsules preferred and enema acceptable if others are unavailable; efficacy is high in randomized trials and contemporary meta-analyses, with sustained cure in most patients and long-term follow-up studies showing durable responses in the majority [^115Gnp27] [^113BHu4j] [^112wXqk1].

> Let me consider emerging microbiome therapeutics and verify where they fit. Standardized live biotherapeutic products are evolving, with phase 1 data for MET-2 showing promising efficacy and safety, and AGA 2024 supports considering fecal microbiota-based therapies in immunocompetent adults after antibiotics; however, severely immunocompromised patients should generally avoid FMT, so I need to ensure patient selection is aligned with immune status and product safety profiles [^114Vqybo] [^116SkKh9] [^111ZByS6].

> I should double-check that guidance aligns on FMT sequencing. ESCMID recommends FMT or bezlotoxumab added to standard antibiotics for second or further recurrences, and IDSA/SHEA similarly endorses FMT after multiple recurrences following appropriate antibiotic therapy, underscoring that microbiome restoration is the cornerstone after repeated failures [^114dQnbP] [^113M11WS].

> Now, I will examine adjunctive strategies that reduce recurrence risk during active therapy. Bezlotoxumab is the only adjunct with randomized evidence for recurrence prevention; absolute risk reduction is greatest when multiple risk factors are present, so I should prioritize its use in older adults, those with recent CDI, immunocompromised hosts, or severe presentations, balancing the CHF signal observed in trials and the potential for higher cardiovascular events in vulnerable patients [^113jpiTE] [^1133nP7L].

> Hmm, wait a minute, what about prophylactic oral vancomycin when patients with a prior CDI history require systemic antibiotics for other indications? Retrospective data suggested benefit, but a recent randomized trial did not show a statistically significant reduction in recurrence versus placebo, and there is concern for VRE proliferation; thus, I should not routinely recommend prophylactic vancomycin outside of carefully selected high-risk scenarios or clinical trials until more definitive data emerge [^112EUNur] [^115JmnWX].

> I need to ensure I address special populations and settings. In immunocompromised patients, first-line therapy remains fidaxomicin or vancomycin, but I should avoid FMT in severely immunocompromised hosts and exercise caution with bezlotoxumab in those with significant cardiovascular comorbidity; in IBD flares with CDI, treat with vancomycin and avoid FMT for rCDI given limited and conflicting data; in pregnancy and pediatrics, evidence is limited, so therapy should be individualized and guideline-concordant when possible [^111hQW8k] [^111ZByS6] [^113Dfg3L] [^111pPV6a].

> Next, I should review monitoring and how to judge response or failure. Clinical response typically manifests within 3–5 days of appropriate therapy; if there is no improvement by day 3–5, I should verify the diagnosis, assess for complications, and consider switching from metronidazole to vancomycin or fidaxomicin if not already used; after FMT, routine testing for C. difficile is not recommended in asymptomatic patients, but I should monitor closely for early failure, which occurs in roughly 16–19% within 4–8 weeks and is more likely with severe disease or inpatient status [^117P9CnH] [^1166aHLX] [^1157Bczn].

> Hold on, I should verify the cost-effectiveness argument to support fidaxomicin and FMT sequencing. Modeling studies demonstrate that using fidaxomicin for initial nonsevere CDI, vancomycin for severe CDI, fidaxomicin for first recurrence, and FMT for subsequent recurrences is cost-effective at conventional thresholds, and emerging models suggest FMT may be cost-effective even for first recurrence, reinforcing a strategy that invests upfront to avert downstream failures and hospitalizations [^1177AY38] [^1169fosC].

> Let me synthesize a practical, stepwise algorithm and ensure internal consistency. Start with fidaxomicin for the initial episode when available, or vancomycin if fidaxomicin is not accessible; for a first recurrence, use fidaxomicin or a tapered/pulsed vancomycin regimen, adding bezlotoxumab if high risk for recurrence; for a second or further recurrence, proceed to FMT or a microbiome-based therapy after appropriate antibiotics, reserving repeat FMT for early failure; throughout, maintain strong stewardship, discontinue unnecessary PPIs when feasible, and reserve prophylactic vancomycin only for carefully selected high-risk scenarios pending stronger evidence [^116LPUD8] [^116gZZ47] [^115Gnp27] [^112EUNur].

> I should double-check one potential pitfall in my earlier thinking. Initially, I almost framed metronidazole as an option for a first recurrence based on older paradigms; however, contemporary guidelines discourage metronidazole in recurrence due to inferior sustained response and neurotoxicity with repeated courses, so I need to correct that and emphasize fidaxomicin or tapered vancomycin instead [^112UWMQ1] [^116LPUD8].

> Finally, let me reconsider emerging directions so I don't miss evolving options. Next-generation microbiome therapeutics and selective colonization resistance strategies are under active study and may broaden access and safety compared with donor-dependent FMT; until then, I should align with current high-quality guidelines and tailor choices to patient-specific recurrence risk, access, and comorbidities to optimize sustained cure and minimize the burden of recurrent CDI [^117VWGiV] [^114Vqybo] [^113ue2qN].

For recurrent C. difficile infection (rCDI), **fidaxomicin is preferred** for the first recurrence because it lowers recurrence versus vancomycin [^1136HY8G] [^116gZZ47] [^115DgiMm]. If fidaxomicin is unavailable or not tolerated, **tapered/pulsed vancomycin** is an alternative [^113DfF86] [^116reUE7]. For multiple recurrences, **fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT)** is recommended and achieves high cure rates [^113BHu4j] [^115Gnp27]. Bezlotoxumab can be added in high-risk patients to reduce recurrence [^1124WVQL] [^1133nP7L]. Metronidazole is not recommended for rCDI due to lower efficacy and higher recurrence [^112UWMQ1] [^111AaDp8].

---

## Definitions and epidemiology

Recurrent CDI is defined as recurrence of symptoms within 8 weeks after completing appropriate therapy, confirmed by repeat testing [^111Rfr6P]. Recurrence occurs in approximately 20% of patients after an initial episode, with risk increasing to 40–60% after a first recurrence [^113bv8ST] [^116u6pbS].

---

## Risk factors for recurrence

Several factors increase the risk of recurrence:

- **Advanced age**: Particularly ≥ 65 years [^113L3Lr8].
- **Immunocompromised status**: Including HIV, malignancy, or immunosuppressive therapy [^111hQW8k].
- **Severe initial infection**: Indicated by elevated WBC, creatinine, or ICU admission [^113L3Lr8].
- **Concomitant antibiotics**: Especially broad-spectrum agents [^117P9CnH].
- **Proton pump inhibitor use**: Associated with increased recurrence risk [^116u6pbS].

---

## Treatment strategies for recurrent CDI

### First recurrence

For the first recurrence, **Fidaxomicin** 200 mg orally twice daily for 10 days is preferred due to lower recurrence rates than vancomycin [^1136HY8G] [^116gZZ47] [^115DgiMm]. Alternatively, **tapered/pulsed vancomycin** (125 mg four times daily for 10–14 days, then twice daily for 7 days, then once daily for 7 days, then every 2–3 days for 2–8 weeks) is recommended if fidaxomicin is unavailable or not tolerated [^113DfF86] [^117RYFan].

---

### Multiple recurrences (≥ 2 recurrences)

For multiple recurrences (≥ 2), **fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT)** is recommended and achieves high cure rates (80–90%) [^1146JxGY] [^115Gnp27]. If FMT is unavailable or contraindicated, **extended-pulsed fidaxomicin** (200 mg twice daily for 5 days, then every other day for 20 days) is an alternative [^116gZZ47] [^112UWMQ1].

---

## Adjunctive therapies

Bezlotoxumab, a monoclonal antibody against toxin B, can be added to standard antibiotic therapy in patients at high risk of recurrence (age ≥ 65, immunocompromised, severe CDI) [^1124WVQL] [^1133nP7L]. Rifaximin 400 mg three times daily for 14 days may be considered after fidaxomicin or vancomycin, though evidence is limited and resistance is a concern [^116LPUD8].

---

## Emerging therapies

Live biotherapeutic products such as SER-109 and VE303 are under investigation and show promise in preventing recurrence [^117P9CnH] [^114itdpP]. Microbiome restoration therapies aim to restore gut microbiota diversity and colonization resistance, potentially reducing recurrence [^115DzA9v] [^112HHAyD].

---

## Preventive measures

- **Antibiotic stewardship**: Minimize unnecessary antibiotic use, especially broad-spectrum agents [^116ep8da] [^117P9CnH].
- **Probiotics**: Not recommended for primary or secondary prevention of CDI recurrence [^113qFSH2] [^117KHmm9].
- **Oral vancomycin prophylaxis**: May be considered in patients with recurrent CDI who require systemic antibiotics, though evidence is limited [^114w94MX] [^112EUNur].

---

## Clinical outcomes and quality of life

Recurrent CDI significantly impairs quality of life, causing persistent diarrhea, abdominal pain, anxiety, and social isolation [^1177TYk7]. Effective treatment strategies, particularly FMT, markedly improve quality of life and reduce healthcare utilization [^113rCPHT].

---

## Summary of treatment recommendations

| **Recurrence episode** | **Preferred treatment** | **Alternative treatment** | **Adjunctive therapy** |
|-|-|-|-|
| First recurrence | Fidaxomicin 200 mg BID × 10 days | Tapered/pulsed vancomycin | Bezlotoxumab if high risk |
| Multiple recurrences | FMT | Extended-pulsed fidaxomicin | Bezlotoxumab if high risk |

---

Recurrent CDI requires a **stepwise approach**, with fidaxomicin or tapered vancomycin for first recurrence and FMT for multiple recurrences. Bezlotoxumab is a key adjunct in high-risk patients, and emerging microbiome therapies may further improve outcomes.

### Evolution of clinical guidelines for antimicrobial management ofinfection [^114kKMFz]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) has been an epidemic for many years. Our biggest challenge in treating CDI is preventing recurrence, which is seen in approximately 25% of patients with initial infection and in 40–60% of those with subsequent episodes. Given the major disease burden of this infection, appropriate data-driven treatment remains essential. Clinical treatment guidelines provide an unbiased critical analysis of the literature, integrating the quality of the available data to make recommendations. As CDI has been evolving and more research has become available, the frequency of guideline issue from various global societies has increased, as has the detail of the recommendations to fit more relevant clinical scenarios. In this review, we will discuss clinical guideline recommendations over three time periods: The Initial Guidelines 1995–1997, The Second Wave 2009–2013, and The Modern Era 2014-present. We see the changing recommendations from metronidazole or vancomycin for initial infection during earlier times to preferential treatment with fidaxomicin within the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and Society of Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA) joint guidelines provisional update in late 2020. The recommended treatments for first recurrence were initially with the same antimicrobial as the first episode but have since changed to having multiple options for one or more recurrences. We have also seen the addition of immune boosting treatments, including fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT)/microbiota restoration therapy (MRT) and bezlotoxumab in the more modern recommendations. As the guidelines are evolving with the times, it remains important to understand the differences among them so we can apply this information clinically and optimize patient outcomes.

### European society of clinical microbiology and infectious diseases: 2021 update on the treatment guidance document for Clostridioides difficile infection in adults [^113ue2qN]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2021). Medium credibility.

Scope

In 2009, the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID) published the first treatment guidance document for Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI). This document was updated in 2014. The growing literature on CDI antimicrobial treatment and novel treatment approaches, such as faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) and toxin-binding monoclonal antibodies, prompted the ESCMID study group on C. difficile (ESGCD) to update the 2014 treatment guidance document for CDI in adults.

Methods and Questions

Key questions on CDI treatment were formulated by the guideline committee and included: What is the best treatment for initial, severe, severe-complicated, refractory, recurrent and multiple recurrent CDI? What is the best treatment when no oral therapy is possible? Can prognostic factors identify patients at risk for severe and recurrent CDI and is there a place for CDI prophylaxis? Outcome measures for treatment strategy were: clinical cure, recurrence and sustained cure. For studies on surgical interventions and severe-complicated CDI the outcome was mortality. Appraisal of available literature and drafting of recommendations was performed by the guideline drafting group. The total body of evidence for the recommendations on CDI treatment consists of the literature described in the previous guidelines, supplemented with a systematic literature search on randomized clinical trials and observational studies from 2012 and onwards. The Grades of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system was used to grade the strength of our recommendations and the quality of the evidence. The guideline committee was invited to comment on the recommendations. The guideline draft was sent to external experts and a patients' representative for review. Full ESCMID endorsement was obtained after a public consultation procedure.

Recommendations

Important changes compared with previous guideline include but are not limited to: metronidazole is no longer recommended for treatment of CDI when fidaxomicin or vancomycin are available, fidaxomicin is the preferred agent for treatment of initial CDI and the first recurrence of CDI when available and feasible, FMT or bezlotoxumab in addition to standard of care antibiotics (SoC) are preferred for treatment of a second or further recurrence of CDI, bezlotoxumab in addition to SoC is recommended for the first recurrence of CDI when fidaxomicin was used to manage the initial CDI episode, and bezlotoxumab is considered as an ancillary treatment to vancomycin for a CDI episode with high risk of recurrence when fidaxomicin is not available. Contrary to the previous guideline, in the current guideline emphasis is placed on risk for recurrence as a factor that determines treatment strategy for the individual patient, rather than the disease severity.

### Prevention and treatment of recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection [^112EWRdz]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is a significant burden on the health system, especially due to high recurrence rates. Since the beginning of the CDI epidemic in early 2000s, many strategies for combatting recurrence have been explored, with moderate success so far. This review will focus on the most recent developments in recurrent CDI prevention and treatment.

Recent Findings

There are two main mechanisms of CDI recurrence: alteration in microbiome and poor antibody response. Development of new antibiotics aims to minimize damage to the microbiome. Fecal transplant or other microbiome replacement therapies seek to replenish the missing elements in the microbiome. Fecal microbiota transplant is the most effective treatment for prevention of CDI recurrenceso far, but is difficult to standardize and regulate, leading to efforts to develop microbiome-derived therapeutics. A deficiency in developing antibodies to C. difficile toxins is another mechanism of recurrence. Active immunization using toxoid vaccines or passive immunization using mAbs address this aspect.

Summary

There are promising new treatments for recurrent CDI in development. Fecal microbiota transplant remains the most effective therapy for multiply recurrent CDI. New antibiotics, microbiome-derived therapeutics, and immunologic therapies are in development.

### Challenges in the diagnosis and management of recurrent and severe Clostridioides difficile infection in children [^111pPV6a]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2021). Medium credibility.

Children with Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) can experience recurrent or severe disease. Recurrent CDI occurs in 20%-30% of children with an initial CDI episode. A careful clinical evaluation is important to distinguish recurrent CDI from other disorders that cause recurring gastrointestinal symptoms. Multiple treatment options exist for recurrent CDI, but the optimal therapeutic approach remains undefined. Severe or fulminant CDI can result in poor outcomes and significant morbidity in children. Since there is not a validated definition for severe CDI in children, physicians must use their clinical judgment to identify patients with severe CDI to institute appropriate therapy. In this review, we describe the diagnostic and management challenges in caring for children with recurrent and severe CDI.

Introduction

Evolution of Guideline-Based Antimicrobial Recommendations to Treat C. difficile Infection. Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is the most common healthcare-associated infection in the United States (US), imposing a major burden on our healthcare system and affecting approximately 365,000 people annually. The financial burden of managing this infection is significant as well. It is estimated that all-cause direct medical costs for a population aged 18–64 were approximately US$72,000 for those with no recurrence and approximately US$200,000 for those with three or more recurrences. Given these considerations, optimizing therapies with data-driven recommendations by experts in the field can be most beneficial to minimize the burden of this disease on our patients, lessen the frequency of recurrence, and improve overall outcomes. Clinical guideline recommendations are an essential tool guiding treatment as they summarize data for a disease and provide algorithms to manage patients based on data that has been critically validated.

The CDI epidemic essentially began in the mid-1990s and continues to this day. As this epidemic has extended, there have been more reports and studies considering this infection. When searching " C. difficile " in PubMed, there were 68 references in 1995. In 2020, there were 726. With this influx of new studies, there have been surprisingly few well-performed prospective randomized controlled trials comparing treatments head-to-head. As a result, we rely on smaller studies or non-standard designs to guide our treatments for CDI and recurrent disease. This reliance on imperfect studies has led to certain foundational treatments becoming standard without the supporting data that we would typically expect from a clinical guideline that impacts care as significantly as guidelines for the management of CDI. Given these limitations, it is important to understand how the guidelines have changed over time, and, most importantly, what foundational studies have paved the way for the most recent recommendations in order for clinicians to make decisions that are most appropriate for their patients with the best insights to the data that support those decisions.

### Clostridioides difficile infections; new treatments and future perspectives [^117VWGiV]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

As a significant cause of global morbidity and mortality, Clostridioides difficile infections (CDIs) are listed by the Centres for Disease Control and prevention as one of the top 5 urgent threats in the United States. CDI occurs from gut microbiome dysbiosis, typically through antibiotic-mediated disruption; however, antibiotics are the treatment of choice, which can result in recurrent infections. Here, we highlight new treatments available and provide a perspective on different classes of future treatments.

Recent Findings

Due to the reduced risk of disease recurrence, the microbiome-sparing antibiotic Fidaxomicin has been recommended as the first-line treatment for C. difficile infection. Based on the success of faecal microbiota transplantations (FMT) in treating CDI recurrence, defined microbiome biotherapeutics offer a safer and more tightly controlled alterative as an adjunct to antibiotic therapy. Given the association between antibiotic-mediated dysbiosis of the intestinal microbiota and the recurrence of CDI, future prospective therapies aim to reduce the dependence on antibiotics for the treatment of CDI.

Summary

With current first-in-line antibiotic therapy options associated with high levels of recurrent CDI, the availability of new generation targeted therapeutics can really impact treatment success. There are still unknowns about the long-term implications of these new CDI therapeutics, but efforts to expand the CDI treatment toolbox can offer multiple solutions for clinicians to treat this multifaceted infectious disease to reduce patient suffering.

### Meeting the challenge of recurrent Clostridium difficile infection [^112cj98B]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Recurrent Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is a growing problem that poses significant management challenges. There is no strong evidence to support a particular treatment strategy for recurrent CDI, especially those with multiple recurrences. However, a key strategy for reducing recurrent CDI is prompt diagnosis and treatment, facilitated by early recognition of patients at risk for recurrence.

### Fecal microbiota transplantation for the treatment of recurrent Clostridioides difficile (Clostridium difficile) [^113BHu4j]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Clostridioides difficile (formerly known as Clostridium difficile) is a bacterium that can cause potentially life-threatening diarrheal illness in individuals with an unhealthy mixture of gut bacteria, known as dysbiosis, and can cause recurrent infections in nearly a third of infected individuals. The traditional treatment of recurrent C difficile infection (rCDI) includes antibiotics, which may further exacerbate dysbiosis. There is growing interest in correcting the underlying dysbiosis in rCDI using of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT); and there is a need to establish the benefits and harms of FMT for the treatment of rCDI based on data from randomized controlled trials.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and harms of donor-based fecal microbiota transplantation for the treatment of recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection in immunocompetent people.

Search Methods

We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search date was 31 March 2022.

Selection Criteria

We considered randomized trials of adults or children with rCDI for inclusion. Eligible interventions must have met the definition of FMT, which is the administration of fecal material containing distal gut microbiota from a healthy donor to the gastrointestinal tract of a person with rCDI. The comparison group included participants who did not receive FMT and were given placebo, autologous FMT, no intervention, or antibiotics with activity against C difficile.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were 1. proportion of participants with resolution of rCDI and 2. serious adverse events. Our secondary outcomes were 3. treatment failure, 4. all-cause mortality, 5. withdrawal from study, 6. rate of new CDI infection after a successful FMT, 7. any adverse event, 8. quality of life, and 9. colectomy. We used the GRADE criteria to assess certainty of evidence for each outcome.

Main Results

We included six studies with 320 participants. Two studies were conducted in Denmark, and one each in the Netherlands, Canada, Italy, and the US. Four were single-center and two were multicenter studies. All studies included only adults. Five studies excluded people who were severely immunocompromised, with only one study including 10 participants who were receiving immunosuppressive therapy out of the 64 enrolled; these were similarly distributed between the FMT arm (4/24 or 17%) and comparison arms (6/40 or 15%). The route of administration was the upper gastrointestinal tract via a nasoduodenal tube in one study, two studies used enema only, two used colonoscopic only delivery, and one used either nasojejunal or colonoscopic delivery, depending on a clinical determination of whether the recipient could tolerate a colonoscopy. Five studies had at least one comparison group that received vancomycin. The risk of bias (RoB 2) assessments did not find an overall high risk of bias for any outcome. All six studies assessed the efficacy and safety of FMT for the treatment of rCDI. Pooled results from six studies showed that the use of FMT in immunocompetent participants with rCDI likely leads to a large increase in resolution of rCDI in the FMT group compared to control (risk ratio (RR) 1.92, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.36 to 2.71; P = 0.02, I² = 63%; 6 studies, 320 participants; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 3; moderate-certainty evidence). Fecal microbiota transplantation probably results in a slight reduction in serious adverse events; however, the CIs around the summary estimate were wide (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.41; P = 0.24, I² = 26%; 6 studies, 320 participants; NNTB 12; moderate-certainty evidence). Fecal microbiota transplantation may result in a reduction in all-cause mortality; however, the number of events was small, and the CIs of the summary estimate were wide (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.22 to 1.45; P = 0.48, I² = 0%; 6 studies, 320 participants; NNTB 20; low-certainty evidence). None of the included studies reported colectomy rates.

Authors' Conclusions

In immunocompetent adults with rCDI, FMT likely leads to a large increase in the resolution of recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection compared to alternative treatments such as antibiotics. There was no conclusive evidence regarding the safety of FMT for the treatment of rCDI as the number of events was small for serious adverse events and all-cause mortality. Additional data from large national registry databases might be required to assess any short-term or long-term risks with using FMT for the treatment of rCDI. Elimination of the single study that included some immunocompromised people did not alter these conclusions. Due to the low number of immunocompromised participants enrolled, conclusions cannot be drawn about the risks or benefits of FMT for rCDI in the immunocompromised population.

### Comparison of the 2010 and 2017 Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of Clostridium difficile infection [^11413NZa]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To highlights the key changes in the updated Infectious Diseases Society of America and Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America guidelines with respect to the diagnosis and treatment of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI).

Recent Findings

CDI continues as a major threat to healthcare institutions and as a community-associated infection related primarily to antibiotic exposure. Infectious Diseases Society of America/Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America produced extensive CDI guidelines in 2010; in 2018, updated guidance has been published. The new guidelines include key changes with respect to the treatment and diagnosis of CDI.

Summary

Updated, evidence guidelines allow optimization of the diagnosis of CDI and the use of therapeutic interventions, in particular to reduce the risk of recurrent infection.

### Clostridioides difficile infection [^1117Ls5B]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Clostridioides difficile (formerly Clostridium difficile) infection is the most frequently identified health care-associated infection in the United States. C difficile has also emerged as a cause of community-associated diarrhea, resulting in increased incidence of community-associated infection. Clinical illness ranges in severity from mild diarrhea to fulminant colitis and death. Appropriate management of infection requires understanding of the various diagnostic assays and therapeutic options as well as relevant measures to infection prevention. This article provides updated recommendations regarding the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of incident and recurrent C difficile infection.

CURRENT AND NEWLY APPROVED Clostridioides difficile INFECTION TREATMENTS

The vegetative bacteria can be successfully eliminated with antimicrobial therapy; however, the spores are highly resilient and can persist in the gut. The treatment of initial CDI with antimicrobial therapy can cause further disruptions to the microbiota, exacerbating the intestinal dysbiosis and potentially leading to the relapse of symptoms, known as CDI recurrence. CDI recurrence is defined as the onset of symptoms within 8 weeks of clinical cure from a previous episode and can occur in up to 20% of patients, with increasing frequency with each subsequent episode. This highlights the need to combine current antimicrobial regimes with microbiota-restorative therapies to re-establish colonization resistance of the commensal microbiota and reduce the likelihood of recurrent disease.

In line with current guidelines, CDI treatment options include fidaxomicin, vancomycin and metronidazole. Fidaxomicin is a narrow spectrum antibiotic that demonstrates superior preservation of the intestinal microbiota when compared to vancomycin and is associated with similar clinical cure rates and a lower risk of CDI recurrence. Fidaxomicin standard therapy (200 mg, 12 hourly for 10 days) is recommended as the first choice for treatment of the initial episode of nonsevere CDI, severe CDI and severe-complicated/refractory CDI. If fidaxomicin is not available, standard vancomycin therapy (125 mg, 6 hourly for 10 days) can be used as an alternative. Metronidazole is no longer recommended as a first line agent to treat CDI as the clinical cure rate demonstrated inferiority to vancomycin and was found to be a robust predictor of recurrence; however, despite recommendations, metronidazole remains a first line treatment option in many countries due to the cost and availability of alternatives.

### Faecal microbiota transplantation for recurrentinfection: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis [^112ZGbQr]. EClinicalMedicine (2020). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is an effective treatment for recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI). CDI is a leading cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea, and 22–32% experience prolonged or recurrent infections unresponsive to standard antibiotics. Recurrent CDI is associated with a high mortality, and preventing the infection poses a substantial therapeutic challenge with limited treatment options. During the last decade, FMT has emerged as a viable treatment for recurrent CDI. With effect rates of up to 94% in clinical trials, FMT is now recommended by scientific societies and National Health agencies for patients with 2 or more recurrences of CDI.

Previous systematic reviews have confirmed the high clinical effect of FMT for recurrent CDI and indicated that the treatment effect may depend on the method of delivery and treatment regimens. Still, no clear clinical evidence exists for the cumulative effect of FMT following single or repeated treatment regimens, and the quality of evidence for FMT compared with standard antibiotics has been rated as moderate in previous systematic reviews and guidelines due to inconsistencies. These inconsistencies have resulted in caution and questioned the position of FMT in the CDI treatment algorithm until the evidence for FMT has been evaluated in more detail. Now, further to these earlier systematic reviews, more evidence has accumulated, and new methods of delivery have emerged; as such, an update of the evidence with the latest data is pivotal to guide clinical decisions and improve the future recommendations for FMT in managing patients with recurrent CDI.

The aims of this systematic review and meta-analysis were to establish the evidence for using FMT in recurrent CDI, to provide updated effect estimates specific to different delivery methods and treatment regimens, and to compare the effect of FMT with that of standard antibiotics.

### Cost-effectiveness of treatment regimens for Clostridioides difficile infection: an evaluation of the 2018 Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines [^1177AY38]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

In 2018, the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) published guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of Clostridioides (formerly Clostridium) difficile infection (CDI). However, there is little guidance regarding which treatments are cost-effective.

Methods

We used a Markov model to simulate a cohort of patients presenting with an initial CDI diagnosis. We used the model to estimate the costs, effectiveness, and cost-effectiveness of different CDI treatment regimens recommended in the recently published 2018 IDSA guidelines. The model includes stratification by the severity of the initial infection, and subsequent likelihood of cure, recurrence, mortality, and outcomes of subsequent recurrences. Data sources were taken from IDSA guidelines and published literature on treatment outcomes. Outcome measures were discounted quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs).

Results

Use of fidaxomicin for nonsevere initial CDI, vancomycin for severe CDI, fidaxomicin for first recurrence, and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) for subsequent recurrence (strategy 44) cost an additional $478 for 0.009 QALYs gained per CDI patient, resulting in an ICER of $31 751 per QALY, below the willingness-to-pay threshold of $100 000/QALY. This is the optimal, cost-effective CDI treatment strategy.

Conclusions

Metronidazole is suboptimal for nonsevere CDI as it is less beneficial than alternative strategies. The preferred treatment regimen is fidaxomicin for nonsevere CDI, vancomycin for severe CDI, fidaxomicin for first recurrence, and FMT for subsequent recurrence. The most effective treatments, with highest cure rates, are also cost-effective due to averted mortality, utility loss, and costs of rehospitalization and/or further treatments for recurrent CDI.

### Recent advances in Clostridioides difficile infection epidemiology, diagnosis and treatment in children [^113gXgd3]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) classified Clostridioides difficile as an 'urgent' public health threat that requires 'urgent and aggressive action'. This call to action has led to new discoveries that have advanced C. difficile infection (CDI) epidemiology, diagnosis and treatment, albeit predominantly in adults. In 2017, the Infectious Diseases Society of America and Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America published clinical practice guidelines for both adults and children. At that time, recommendations in children were generally limited to relatively low-quality evidence.

Recent Findings

Since publication of this guidance, there have been many advancements in the understanding of CDI in children. These include better understanding of healthcare settings as uncommon sources of C. difficile acquisition in children; risk factors for recurrent and community-associated CDI; performance of diagnostic tests in children and strategies for optimizing their use; and a more rigorous evidence base for CDI treatment in children, including the first-ever randomized controlled trial of CDI treatment in children and the largest study of fecal microbiota transplantation in children.

Summary

This review highlights the most recent salient advancements in paediatric CDI knowledge and practice that supplement published clinical guidance provided prior to these advancements.

### The effect of a microbial ecosystem therapeutic (MET-2) on recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection: a phase 1, open-label, single-group trial [^114Vqybo]. The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2021). High credibility.

Background

Faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is highly effective for recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection but has inherent risks. Microbial Ecosystem Therapeutic 2 (MET-2) is an oral encapsulated formulation of 40 lyophilised bacterial species initially isolated from stool of a healthy donor, but subsequently manufactured independently of donors, eliminating potential risks introduced by changes in donor health. The aim of this study was to determine MET-2 activity, safety, and tolerability.

Methods

This phase 1, open-label, single-group feasibility study was done in Alberta, Canada. The main inclusion criteria were mild to moderate C difficile infection and at least one episode of C difficile infection recurrence (ie, two episodes of C difficile infection) within 12 months. Initial daily treatment was ten oral capsules for 2 days, then three capsules for 8 days. If C difficile infection recurred, a higher dose was offered: 20 capsules for 2 days, then three capsules for 8 days. Patients were followed for adverse events and C difficile infection recurrence up to day 130. The primary outcome was absence of C difficile infection recurrence (fewer than three unformed bowel movements in 24 h persisting for at least 2 days) at day 40 by intention-to-treat analysis. Secondary outcomes were mortality or hospitalisation due to C difficile infection, infections attributed to treatment, nausea, abdominal pain, vomiting, or diarrhoea during treatment, quality of life (C difficile Health Related Quality of Life Questionnaire) before and after treatment, and engrafted MET-2 bacteria in patient stool. Absence of C difficile infection recurrence at day 130 was an exploratory outcome. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02865616 FINDINGS: Between Sept 19, 2018, and Feb 28, 2020, we enrolled 19 adult patients with at least two episodes of mild to moderate C difficile infection (median age 65 years [IQR 56–67]; 12 women [63%], seven men [37%]). Recurrent C difficile infection was absent at day 40 in 15 (79%) of 19 patients after initial treatment, increasing to 18 (95%) 40 days after retreatment. No mortality associated with C difficile infection, infections associated with MET-2 treatment, or other serious adverse events were observed. The most common self-limited, mild to moderate symptoms reported during treatment were diarrhoea in 12 (63%) of 19 patients and abdominal cramps in 12 (63%). After MET-2 treatment, quality of life improved significantly, as did alpha diversity in stool microbial composition (p = 1·93×10–6). MET-2 associated taxa were found in greater abundance in most patients after treatment compared with baseline. 16 (84%) of 19 patients did not have recurrence of C difficile infection by day 130.

Interpretation

MET-2 appears to be safe, efficacious, and well tolerated among patients with recurrent C difficile infection. Results must be validated in controlled studies.

### Clostridioides difficile infection: update on management [^115WwQeP]. American Family Physician (2020). Medium credibility.

Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of Clostridioides difficile infection have recently been updated. Risk factors include recent exposure to health care facilities or antibiotics, especially clindamycin. C. difficile infection is characterized by a wide range of symptoms, from mild or moderate diarrhea to severe disease with pseudomembranous colitis, colonic ileus, toxic megacolon, sepsis, or death. C. difficile infection should be considered in patients who are not taking laxatives and have three or more episodes of unexplained, unformed stools in 24 hours. Testing in these patients should start with enzyme immunoassays for glutamate dehydrogenase and toxins A and B or nucleic acid amplification testing. In children older than 12 months, testing is recommended only for those with prolonged diarrhea and risk factors. Treatment depends on whether the episode is an initial vs. recurrent infection and on the severity of the infection based on white blood cell count, serum creatinine level, and other clinical signs and symptoms. For an initial episode of nonsevere C. difficile infection, oral vancomycin or oral fidaxomicin is recommended. Metronidazole is no longer recommended as first-line therapy for adults. Fecal microbiota transplantation is a reasonable treatment option with high cure rates in patients who have had multiple recurrent episodes and have received appropriate antibiotic therapy for at least three of the episodes. Good antibiotic stewardship is a key strategy to decrease rates of C. difficile infection. In routine or endemic settings, hands should be cleaned with either soap and water or an alcohol-based product, but during outbreaks soap and water is superior. The Infectious Diseases Society of America does not recommend the use of probiotics for prevention of C. difficile infection.

### Oral vancomycin for prevention of recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection: a randomized clinical trial [^115JmnWX]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is the most common cause of health care–associated diarrhea. Over one-third of patients who develop CDI will develop 1 or more recurrences; recurrence risk increases with each episode. The main risk factor for CDI is antibiotic use. Following therapy and resolution of initial CDI, recurrent CDI may be triggered when antibiotics are given for other indications. Prevention is essential to reduce the myriad medical, social, and psychological consequences of recurrent CDI. Interventions to prevent recurrent CDI during exposure to systemic antibiotics in a person with prior but not current CDI are needed in clinical practice.

Oral vancomycin for prophylaxis against recurrent CDI has been used in clinical practice based on retrospective cohort studies showing possible favorable outcomes. However, their observational designs precluded assessing efficacy because of confounding, heterogeneity in data availability, inclusion criteria, study populations, and uncertainty regarding the magnitude of the effect. In a prospective trial in asymptomatic patients colonized with C difficile, oral vancomycin was effective in eliminating fecal C difficile during and immediately after treatment, but most participants began to shed C difficile again within approximately 3 weeks of completing oral vancomycin treatment.

Whether oral vancomycin prophylaxis is effective against recurrent CDI remains unanswered. Furthermore, most studies have looked primarily at benefits of treatment without evaluating potential risks. This is a critical gap in the field, as oral vancomycin is not without risk (particularly, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus [VRE] gut proliferation).,

We conducted a prospective randomized clinical trial to assess the effect of oral vancomycin prophylaxis on recurrent CDI incidence and VRE carriage of the gut in patients with a recent CDI who were taking systemic antibiotics for a non-CDI indication. This study aimed to evaluate whether a low dose of oral vancomycin administered during and immediately following non–CDI-indicated antibiotic treatment was effective in preventing recurrent CDI.

### The effect of antibiotic therapy for Clostridioides difficile infection on mortality and other patient-relevant outcomes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111AaDp8]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Current practice guidelines favour fidaxomicin over vancomycin and exclude metronidazole from the recommended standard regimen for Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI), based on lower recurrence rates with fidaxomicin, giving little weight to mortality or the clinical implications of recurrences.

Objectives

To compile the effects of metronidazole, glycopeptides (vancomycin or teicoplanin), and fidaxomicin for CDI on mortality and other patient-relevant outcomes.

Data Sources

PubMed, the Cochrane Library, ClinicalTrials.gov, conference proceedings, and Google Scholar, until August 2023.

Study Eligibility Criteria

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

Participants

Adult patients experiencing primary or recurrent CDI.

Interventions

Glycopeptides versus fidaxomicin or metronidazole (comparators).

Assessment Of Risk Of Bias

We used the Risk of Bias 2 (RoB 2) tool for randomized trials, focusing on the outcome of all-cause mortality.

Methods Of Data Synthesis

Random effects meta-analyses were performed for dichotomous outcomes. Outcomes were summarized preferentially for all randomly assigned patients.

Results

Thirteen trials were included. There was no significant difference in all-cause mortality (risk ratio [RR] < 1 favouring the comparator) between vancomycin and fidaxomicin (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.64–1.14, 8 RCTs, 1951 patients) or metronidazole (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.46–1.32, 4 RCTs, 808 patients), with low and very low certainty of evidence, respectively. No significant difference in initial treatment failure between fidaxomicin and vancomycin was found, however, initial treatment failure was higher with metronidazole (RR 1.58, 95% CI 1.10–2.27, 5 RCTs, 843 patients). No study reported on symptomatic recurrence necessitating re-treatment among all randomly assigned patients. Among initially cured patients, symptomatic recurrence necessitating re-treatment was lower with fidaxomicin than with vancomycin (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.42–0.71, 6 RCTs, 1617 patients). None of the studies reported on other CDI complications or the burden of infection on daily activities.

Conclusions

Setting patient-relevant outcomes for CDI independently of the RCT definitions and results might lead to less confidence in the guidance for CDI management.

### Current approaches to treat and prevent recurrence of Clostridioides difficile [^112HHAyD]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) and recurrent CDI (rCDI) are significant causes of morbidity and mortality. The microbiome plays a significant role in the body's defense against CDI and rCDI. Antibiotics can cause significant injury to the microbiome which leads to an increased risk of CDI and rCDI. Ongoing perturbations of the microbiome perpetuate this risk. Antibiotic treatments for CDI can kill C difficile but also can impact the microbiome. Microbiome therapeutics are effective in restoring the function of the gut microbiota and re-establishing colonization resistance. The field of microbiome therapeutics is evolving with newer, more refined, modalities in development.

### Clostridioides difficile infections; new treatments and future perspectives [^112TrFGU]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

CDI is mediated through antibiotic-induced intestinal dysbiosis that is exacerbated by current recommended first-in-line antibiotic therapy options, leading to high rates of CDI recurrence. The success of FMT therapy for multiply recurrent CDI has paved the way for next generation live biotherapeutics. Therapies targeted at microbiome restoration as an adjunct to antibiotic therapy can significantly improve treatment success and reduce the risk of disease recurrence. However, evidence suggests survival of C. difficile spores within mucosal biofilm populations, which could have implications for extended treatment success, emphasizing the need for biofilm targeted therapies. The long-term implications of these new CDI therapeutics are still mostly unknown, but efforts to expand the options for CDI treatment can offer multiple alternative solutions to treat this multifaceted infectious disease.

TREATMENT AND PREVENTION OF RECURRENCE

One notable change in the ESCMID treatment guidelines from previous editions is the treatment recommendations for patients at high risk of recurrence. Reducing recurrent CDI is a key goal that can be approached from a number of angles, including: reducing the population at risk of recurrence using effective infection control procedures and antimicrobial stewardship; re-establishing colonization resistance through intestinal microbiota restoration; increasing the patients' immunity and disrupting the pathogenesis pathway.

### Advances in the medical treatment of Clostridioides difficile infection [^111r1xjw]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

Clostridioides difficile medical management has changed significantly over the past decade with emphasis on preventing recurrent infection. This review compares current guidelines on the treatment of initial, recurrent, fulminant, and pediatric C difficile infection (CDI) and evaluates the mechanisms and clinical use of available antibiotics for CDI. C difficile has complex resistance mechanisms to vancomycin, fidaxomicin, and metronidazole which may play a role in treatment outcomes. Antibiotics such as tigecycline and rifaximin as well as monoclonal antibodies against toxin B may play a role in adjunctive therapy. Additional therapies under development include new narrow therapeutic antibiotics.

### Management of Clostridioides difficile infection: diagnosis, treatment, and future perspectives [^116ep8da]. The American Journal of Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Clostridioides difficile infection is the most common healthcare-associated infection in the United States, with potential life-threatening complications and a significant impact on the costs of care. Antibiotic stewardship as well as discontinuation of chronic acid suppressive therapy are key for its prevention and treatment. Effective infection management requires appropriate interpretation of diagnostic tests, as well as the use of vancomycin and fidaxomicin as first-line treatment. Novel treatments such as Bezlotoxumab, fecal microbiota transplant, and live biotherapeutic products are proven effective in recurrent C. difficile infection and address dysbiosis.

### Clostridioides difficile in transplant patients: early diagnosis, treatment, and prevention [^112u1GYC]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Clostridioides difficile infection is common in solid organ transplant and hematopoietic stem-cell transplant recipients and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. These populations are also underrepresented in clinical trials, making optimal management difficult. Because of this, management of these populations follows national guideline recommendations. This review aims to summarize the recent relevant literature pertaining to the clinical management of C. difficile infection in transplant patients, with a particular focus on diagnosis, treatment, and prevention.

Recent Findings

Early diagnosis of C. difficile colonization may mitigate both horizontal and vertical transmission (progression from colonization to colitis) of infection. Once diagnosed, recent literature suggests antibiotic treatment should align with that recommended by national guidelines. Fecal microbiota transplant is an emerging therapy for recurrent C. difficile infection, and recent data have demonstrated safety and efficacy. Prevention strategies including antimicrobial stewardship, probiotic administration, antibiotic administration, and bezlotoxumab may be beneficial in transplant populations, but more data are needed to confirm recent findings.

Summary

Studies evaluating C. difficile infection in transplant patients are only recently starting to emerge. Further research is needed to identify optimal treatment and prevention strategies, and to examine novel strategies such as microbiome manipulation.

### ACG clinical guidelines: prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of Clostridioides difficile infections [^114w94MX]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

ACG Clinical Guidelines — management of CDI recurrence and prevention specify that we suggest fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) be considered for patients with severe and fulminant CDI refractory to antibiotic therapy, particularly when patients are deemed poor surgical candidates (strong recommendation, low quality of evidence). For a first recurrence, we suggest tapering/pulsed dosing of vancomycin be considered after an initial course of fidaxomicin, vancomycin, or metronidazole (strong recommendation, very low quality of evidence), and we recommend fidaxomicin for patients experiencing a first recurrence after an initial course of vancomycin or metronidazole (conditional recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). We recommend patients experiencing their second or further recurrence of CDI be treated with FMT to prevent further recurrences (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). We recommend FMT be delivered through colonoscopy or capsules for treatment of recurrent CDI; we suggest delivery by enema if other methods are unavailable (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence). We suggest repeat FMT for patients experiencing a recurrence of CDI within 8 wk of an initial FMT (conditional recommendation, very low quality of evidence). For patients with rCDI who are not candidates for FMT, who relapse after FMT, or who require ongoing or frequent courses of antibiotics, suppressive oral vancomycin may be used to prevent further recurrences (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence). Oral vancomycin prophylaxis may be considered during subsequent systemic antibiotic use in patients with a history of CDI who are at high risk of recurrence to prevent further recurrence (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence). We suggest bezlotoxumab be considered for prevention of CDI recurrence in patients who are at high risk of recurrence (conditional recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). We suggest against discontinuation of antisecretory therapy in patients with CDI, provided there is an appropriate indication for their use (strong recommendation, very low quality of evidence).

### An open-label, randomized trial comparing fidaxomicin with oral vancomycin for the treatment of Clostridioides difficile infection in hospitalized patients receiving concomitant antibiotics for concurrent infections [^112GCEg7]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection (rCDI) occurs frequently, and concomitant antibiotic (CA) during the initial episode for treatment of non-CDI is a major risk factor. We sought to address the comparative efficacy of fidaxomicin versus vancomycin in the setting of CA during the initial CDI episode.

Methods

We conducted a randomized, controlled, open-label trial at 2 hospitals in Ann Arbor, Michigan. We consecutively consented and enrolled hospitalized patients ≥ 18 years old with diarrhea, a positive test for C. difficile, and ≥ 1 qualifying CA. Complicated CDI, CDI treatment for > 24 hours prior to enrollment, and planned long-term (> 12 weeks) CA use were notable exclusions. Clinical cure was defined as resolution of diarrhea for 2 consecutive days maintained until 2 days after therapy, and rCDI as recurrent diarrhea with positive testing ≤ 30 days after initial treatment. Patients were randomized to fidaxomicin or vancomycin.

Results

Baseline characteristics were similar in the 2 groups of 144 patients. Rates of clinical cure (73% vs 62.9%, P = .195) and rCDI (3.3% vs 4.0%; P > .99) were similar for fidaxomicin and vancomycin in the intention-to-treat and per-protocol cohorts, respectively. Only 4 patients developed rCDI.

Conclusions

In this study of patients with CDI receiving CA, a numerically higher proportion were cured with fidaxomicin versus vancomycin, but this result did not reach statistical significance. Overall recurrence was lower than anticipated in both arms compared with previous studies that did not extend duration of CDI treatment during CA.

### Treatment of refractory and recurrent Clostridium difficile infection [^114RrRBh]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2011). Medium credibility.

The incidence of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) has increased since 2000, with greater numbers of severe cases reported, in part due to the emergence of a hypervirulent strain. Initial therapy with metronidazole is still recommended for mild to moderate CDI, but vancomycin is recommended for first-line therapy of severe CDI. Colectomy could be life-saving for some patients with severe disease that does not respond to maximal medical therapy. Recurrent CDI is a challenge to treat; no single effective therapy currently exists. Treatments include antibiotics, adjunct probiotics, fecal microbiota transplant and immune approaches. This Review discusses the various therapeutic approaches used for the treatment of refractory and recurrent CDI.

### Risk factors for recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection in children [^113CrZKX]. Hospital Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

The aims of this study were to determine the epidemiologic and treatment factors associated with recurrent C. difficile infection in children.

Methods

We conducted a 13-year retrospective review of pediatric C. difficile infections at our institution focusing on the epidemiologic, clinical, and treatment factors associated with recurrent disease. Repeat episodes occurring between 4 weeks and 2 months after initial infection were defined as early recurrences, whereas repeat episodes between 2 and 12 months after initial infection were defined as late recurrences.

Results

We identified 303 children with C. difficile infection. Recurrent infections were limited to children with chronic conditions, affecting 27.4% (68 of 248) of this cohort. Early and late recurrences occurred in 36.8 and 63.2% of children, respectively. Among children with a chronic condition, female sex and initial use of metronidazole (as opposed to vancomycin) were associated with recurrent disease in bivariate and multivariate analyses. Overall, there was a high treatment failure rate (34 of 102, 33.3%) once children had developed recurrent disease.

Conclusions

Findings from this study demonstrate the importance of underlying chronic conditions in the development of recurrent C. difficile disease and the shortcomings of current treatment options for recurrent cases. Additionally, our findings indicate that initial treatment selection may impact the likelihood of future disease, with metronidazole usage being associated with higher recurrence rates than vancomycin. These findings highlight the need for additional studies to better understand the implications of C. difficile treatment strategies.

### Resolution rates in clinical trials for microbiota restoration for recurrentinfection: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis [^113jonvA]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is the most common healthcare-associated infection in the United States with over 50% of patients developing recurrences after two or more episodes. Microbiota replacement therapy (MRT) is used to treat recurrent CDI by restoring a healthy gut microbiome. Guidelines from the Infectious Diseases Society of America and Society of Healthcare Epidemiology of America recommend MRT after appropriate antibiotic treatment after two or more CDI recurrences in patients who have failed appropriate antibiotic treatments.

The efficacy of MRT for recurrent CDI in observational studies is more than 85% but efficacy in controlled clinical trials appears to be lower. Our 2017 meta-analysis showed an overall cure rate of 76% in clinical trial settings with efficacy being lower (67%) in trials with a comparator group compared to open-label trials. Most trials included in that meta-analysis had different methodologies including recurrent CDI diagnostic and inclusion criteria, MRT preparations, and comparator group leading to a significant heterogeneity. These inconsistencies have resulted in limiting the generalizability of these results and pose a caution in positioning MRT as a therapy for CDI.

Since the earlier systematic review and meta-analysis, more evidence from trials regarding use of MRT has emerged. These have included phase III trials of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) and standardized live biotherapeutics for recurrent CDI.

Recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection (rCDI) first recurrence — treatment recommendations and comparative efficacy are as follows: We suggest tapering/pulsed-dose vancomycin for patients experiencing a first recurrence after an initial course of fidaxomicin, vancomycin, or metronidazole (strong recommendation, low quality of evidence). We recommend fidaxomicin for patients experiencing a first recurrence after an initial course of vancomycin or metronidazole (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). rCDI is generally defined as the recurrence of diarrhea and a confirmatory positive test (NAAT or EIA) within 8 weeks after treatment of an initial episode of CDI. In subgroup analyses of two phase 3 trials, fidaxomicin was superior in preventing a second recurrence within 28 days (35.5% of patients treated with vancomycin and 19.7% of patients treated with fidaxomicin, P = 0.045). In older adults, extended‑pulsed fidaxomicin achieved sustained clinical cure 30 days post‑treatment in 124 (70%) of 177 vs 106 (59%) of 179 with vancomycin (P = 0.030). Vancomycin cleared C. difficile by end of therapy more often than metronidazole (89% vs 59%, respectively; P = 0.001). Based on efficacy and safety concerns, metronidazole should not be used to treat rCDI and metronidazole treatment should be limited to 1 course because of risk of neurotoxicity with prolonged or repeated use.

### Cost-effectiveness of fecal microbiota transplantation for first recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection [^1169fosC]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Both the American College of Gastroenterology and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA)/Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America 2021 Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) guidelines recommend fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) for persons with multiple recurrent CDI. Emerging data suggest that FMT may have high cure rates when used for first recurrent CDI. The aim of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of FMT for first recurrent CDI.

Methods

We developed a Markov model to simulate a cohort of patients presenting with initial CDI infection. The model estimated the costs, effectiveness, and cost-effectiveness of different CDI treatment regimens recommended in the 2021 IDSA guidelines, with the additional option of FMT for first recurrent CDI. The model includes stratification by the severity of initial infection, estimates of cure, recurrence, and mortality. Data sources were taken from IDSA guidelines and published literature on treatment outcomes. Outcome measures were quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs).

Results

When FMT is available for first recurrent CDI, the optimal cost-effective treatment strategy is fidaxomicin for initial nonsevere CDI, vancomycin for initial severe CDI, and FMT for first and subsequent recurrent CDI, with an ICER of $27 135/QALY. In probabilistic sensitivity analysis at a $100 000 cost-effectiveness threshold, FMT for first and subsequent CDI recurrence was cost-effective 90% of the time given parameter uncertainty.

Conclusions

FMT is a cost-effective strategy for first recurrent CDI. Prospective evaluation of FMT for first recurrent CDI is warranted to determine the efficacy and risk of recurrence.

Introduction

Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) frequently occurs in vulnerable patient populations, including older patients, those who are immunocompromised, and those with comorbidities, including malignant neoplasm, chronic kidney disease, and other medical conditions. The leading risk factor for CDI is prior exposure to broad-spectrum antibiotics, which disrupt the gastrointestinal microbiome, a diverse ecosystem that provides essential functions for the host and serves as the primary defense against potential pathogens, such as C difficile. In the past 2 decades, CDI has also affected younger patients in the community without traditional risk factors. Clostridioides difficile infection is associated with excess health care burden, with higher hospitalization and mortality rates among inpatients diagnosed with CDI compared with those without a CDI diagnosis.

Clostridioides difficile infection differs from most other infections in that it often recurs despite appropriate antibiotic treatment, highlighting the limitations of current standard therapeutic approaches. Vancomycin and fidaxomicin achieve high stool drug concentrations and have excellent bactericidal activity against C difficile bacteria. Antibiotic treatment commonly leads to resolution of diarrhea in 3 to 5 days in conjunction with rapid decline of stool toxin concentration. Despite these excellent pharmacologic profiles, approximately 15% to 25% of patients with primary CDI experience recurrence after antibiotic treatment completion due to persistence of C difficile spores and alterations to the normal gut flora. Patients with recurrent infection are at increased risk of subsequent episodes, with recurrence rates of 40% or more due to persistent or worsening antibiotic-mediated microbiome disruption and dysfunction.

Thus, although antibiotics are necessary to kill the toxin-producing bacteria, microbiome repair is the foundation for functional restoration and is critical to achieve a sustained clinical response. Most patients with resilience of their microbiome following primary CDI will recover without further CDI episodes. However, patients with persistent microbiome disruption after completion of CDI-targeted antibiotic treatment may have recurrence of CDI due to spore germination and replication of toxin-producing C difficile bacteria. This recurrent cycle is facilitated by modulation of bile acid pathways favorable to C difficile when Firmicutes bacteria are depleted by antibiotics. An increased risk of recurrence is associated with many factors that have also been linked to microbiome disruption: older age, comorbidities, proton pump inhibitor use, spectrum of activity of the inciting antibiotic or recurrent antibiotic exposure, immunosuppression, and most importantly, a history of recurrence.

### Validation of clinical risk tools for recurrentinfection [^115qttcX]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Clostridioides difficile is a Gram positive, spore forming, toxin producing bacterium which can colonize and infect the human intestinal track causing a robust immune response. Unlike most other infectious diseases, C. difficile infection (CDI) tends to relapse and re-infect despite antibiotic treatment and remission of symptoms. C. difficile spores are capable of surviving treatment, resulting in persistent carriage, serving as a nidus for recurrent infection. Most recurrent CDI episodes occur within 2–8 weeks of the initial infection and are due to the previous strain. Newer anti-CDI therapies (ie, fidaxomicin, bezlotoxumab, and fecal microbiota transplant) effectively prevent recurrent CDI and as of April 2023, the first orally administered fecal microbiota product was approved for the prevention of recurrent CDI by the US Food and Drug Administration. However, newer therapies to prevent recurrent CDI have historically been underutilized, despite adoption by recent CDI consensus guidelines. This is likely due to two major issues with CDI treatments: first, these treatments have a high cost and logistical challenges, limiting their use to patients believed to be most at risk of recurrence; second, determining which patients are likely to recur is difficult without a widely accepted risk prediction model for recurrent C. difficile infection.

Several published outcome models (Table 1) for risk stratifying patients with CDI for developing future recurrent infection have been developed retrospectively or by using previous clinical trial data. Few recurrent CDI models have been externally validated and limited evidence suggest that they generalize poorly between centers. In addition, recently updated clinical management guidelines for C. difficile infection mention specific risk factors for recurrence, however, the performance of these features together as a risk stratification tool has not been externally evaluated. We were also interested in comparing C. difficile PCR cycle threshold (as an inverse measure of fecal organism burden), which we recently showed may be a potentially useful biomarker for recurrent infectionalongside existing clinical models. Here, we validate and compare the relative performance of the leading recurrence risk models available for hospitalized cases of C. difficile infection.

### Long-term efficacy and safety of fecal microbiota transplantation for treatment of recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection [^112wXqk1]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Goals

We investigated the long-term efficacy and safety of fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) for the treatment of recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection (rCDI).

Background

FMT has emerged as a promising therapy for patients with rCDI unresponsive to standard medical therapy, though long-term efficacy and safety data are scarce.

Materials and Methods

A multicenter retrospective study was performed on patients treated with FMT for rCDI with ≥ 6 months of clinical follow-up post-FMT. Patients were contacted to document sustained efficacy, potential adverse events, and antibiotic exposure. The electronic medical record was reviewed to confirm patient-reported outcomes and obtain additional data. The primary outcome was sustained cure, as defined by the absence of Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) at any timepoint after FMT.

Results

Of 528 patients treated, 207 were successfully contacted. The mean follow-up post-FMT was 34 (range: 6 to 84) months. One hundred fifty-seven patients (75.8%) reported sustained cure at the time of follow-up. One hundred patients (48%) reported the use of antibiotics for non-CDI indications post-FMT, of whom 11 (11%) had experienced CDI post-FMT. Fifty-two of the original 528 patients (9.8%) treated with FMT had died at the time of follow-up contact; none were felt attributable to the procedure. New medical conditions or diagnoses post-FMT were reported in 105 patients (50.5%). Fifteen reported improvement post-FMT in previously diagnosed medical conditions.

Conclusions

In this largest and longest study to date on efficacy and safety after FMT for treatment of rCDI, we found that the majority of patients experienced long-term cure. Although a number of new conditions developed post-FMT, there was no clustering of diseases associated with dysbiosis.

Clostridium difficile infection is an increasing burden to the health care system, totaling more than $1 billion/year in the United States. Treatment of patients with C difficile infection with metronidazole or vancomycin reduces morbidity and mortality, although the number of patients that do not respond to metronidazole is increasing. Despite initial response rates of greater than 90%, 15%-30% of patients have a relapse in symptoms after successful initial therapy, usually in the first few weeks after treatment is discontinued. Failure to develop specific antibody response has recently been identified as a critical factor in recurrence. The review discusses the different management strategies for initial and recurrent symptomatic C difficile infections.

### Host immunity modulates the efficacy of microbiota transplantation for treatment of Clostridioides difficile infection [^1146JxGY]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

The microbiota, consisting of the community of bacterial, viral, fungal, and protozoa organisms that inhabit a mammalian host, can impact susceptibility to a range of diseases including cancer, diabetes, allergy, obesity, and infection –. An altered or dysbiotic intestinal microbiota is observed in all of these disease states suggesting that resetting the intestinal microbiota with a composition of bacteria from healthy individuals could treat disease. This theory is supported by animal studies demonstrating alleviation of disease through transplantation of bacteria into the diseased host's intestinal tract –. Significant advancements have been made in defining the community of microbial species that are important in supporting human health –. Translating these findings into viable microbiota-based therapies has had limited success in the clinic, however, and is not yet considered a treatment option for most diseases impacted by microbial dysbiosis. One notable exception is the use of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) to treat recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection. FMT treatment of C. difficile infection is the first microbiota-based therapy clinically proven to ameliorate disease. Before such treatment strategies can be broadly implemented, the underlying principles determining success for microbiota-based therapy need to be elucidated.

C. difficile, a gram positive, spore-forming, obligate anaerobe is currently the most common nosocomial infection encountered by hospitalized patients, with nearly a half million patients infected and an estimated 13,000–30,000 deaths annually in the United States alone –. This opportunistic pathogen infects the large intestine following perturbation of the intestinal microbiota. Vancomycin or fidaxomicin are first line treatment options that effectively target the vegetative form of C. difficile, but fail to resolve the underlying condition that promotes infection, a dysbiotic microbiota. Recurrence of C. difficile infection due to repeated failed antibiotic treatments is estimated as high as 25–35% and can cause potentially lethal fulminant colitis. The high recurrence rate following standard antibiotic treatment has spurred the development of new treatment modalities such as FMT. In 2013, the first controlled, double-blinded study reported the superior efficacy of FMT compared to antibiotics in treatment of recurrent C. difficile infection. Subsequent studies demonstrate FMT has an 80–90% cure rate in individuals and this treatment option is now incorporated as standard care for recurrent disease in both Europe and the United States –.

Primary Outcome

Eight weeks after completing treatment, 17 of 39 patients in the oral vancomycin group (43.6%) and 24 of 42 in the placebo group (57.1%) experienced a CDI recurrence (absolute difference in percentage, −13.5%; 95% CI, −35.1% to 8.0%; p = 0.22) (Table 2). There was no statistically significant difference in nonrecurrence probability over time (from start of oral vancomycin or placebo treatment) between treatment groups (Figure 2 A). We also did not find a difference in the distribution of the number of days to first recurrence of CDI between treatment groups (Figure 2 B and C). Similar results were observed in the as–completed treatment analysis (eAppendixes 1 and 2, eTable 1, and eFigure 1 in Supplement 2). There was a slight difference between curves when comparing CDI recurrence between study sites (eAppendix 2, eTable 2, and eFigure 2 in Supplement 2). There was no difference in recurrent CDI outcomes when evaluating subgroups at particularly high risk of recurrent CDI (use of high-risk antibiotics, having an immunocompromised condition, or age ≥ 65 years) (eAppendixes 3–5, eTables 3–5, and eFigures 3–5 in Supplement 2).

### How to: prophylactic interventions for prevention of Clostridioides difficile infection [^1178cpD5]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) remains the leading cause of healthcare-associated diarrhoea, despite existing guidelines for infection control measures and antimicrobial stewardship. The high associated health and economic burden of CDI calls for novel strategies to prevent the development and spread of CDI in susceptible patients.

Objectives

We aim to review CDI prophylactic treatment strategies and their implementation in clinical practice.

Sources

We searched PubMed, Embase, Emcare, Web of Science, and the COCHRANE Library databases to identify prophylactic interventions aimed at prevention of CDI. The search was restricted to articles published in English since 2012.

Content

A toxin-based vaccine candidate is currently being investigated in a phase III clinical trial. However, a recent attempt to develop a toxin-based vaccine has failed. Conventional probiotics have not yet proved to be an effective strategy for prevention of CDI. New promising microbiota-based interventions that bind and inactivate concomitantly administered antibiotics, such as ribaxamase and DAV-132, have been developed. Prophylaxis of CDI with C. difficile antibiotics should not be performed routinely and should be considered only for secondary prophylaxis in very selected patients who are at the highest imminent risk for recurrent CDI (R-CDI) after a thorough evaluation. Faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has proved to be a very effective treatment for patients with multiple recurrences. Bezlotoxumab provides protection against R-CDI, mainly in patients with primary episodes and a high risk of relapse.

Implications

There are no proven effective, evidenced-based prophylaxis options for primary CDI. As for secondary prevention, FMT is considered the option of choice in patients with multiple recurrences. Bezlotoxumab can be added to standard treatment for patients at high risk for R-CDI. The most promising strategies are those aimed at reducing changes in intestinal microbiota and development of a new effective non-toxin-based vaccine.

### Health-related quality of life in patients with recurrentinfections [^1177TYk7]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is a frequent hospital-acquired infection causing symptoms ranging from mild diarrhoea to life-threatening, fulminant colitis. – CDI commonly occurs following antibiotics exposure with subsequent disruption of the colonic microbiota. Primary treatment of CDI is antibiotics, consisting of either vancomycin or fidaxomicin, directed against C. difficile, but 15–30% of all patients with CDI develop recurrent CDI (rCDI). – Faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is a recent treatment alternative and has been found to be superior to antibiotics in obtaining clinical resolution of symptoms without recurrence in patients with rCDI.

The health-related quality of life (HrQoL) of patients with CDI can be substantially affected by the infection due to physical and psychological consequences. – The presence of diarrhoea may affect the patients' ability to perform their usual activities and have adverse social impacts. In addition, emotional distress can present as a consequence of the disease, and most patients fear worsening of symptoms and recurrence of CDI. Studies indicate that these impacts may persist even after receiving effective treatment.

Evidence on the gain in HrQoL after receiving effective treatment is important for evaluating the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of alternative treatment strategies. Precise and relevant quantitative estimates of HrQoL based on preference-based measures are essential for cost-utility analyses in which quality-adjusted life years, combining patients' HrQoL with the length of time spent in a specific health state, are applied to assess the value gained from a medical therapy.

Only a few studies have quantitatively measured HrQoL in patients with CDI. – However, the studies were limited by including patients with ongoing treatment and the lack of a prospective measurement of patients' gain in HrQoL after effective cure of the infection. – In addition, recent systematic reviews on health economic evaluations comparing FMT with antibiotic treatment alternatives have found substantial variations in the values applied for the HrQoL of patients with rCDI. HrQoL measurements of these patients have therefore been called for to reduce the uncertainties of future evaluations.

This study aimed to evaluate the HrQoL in patients with rCDI based on HrQoL measurements from a recent randomised controlled trial (RCT)comparing vancomycin, fidaxomicin and FMT for patients with rCDI, and consequently estimate the gain in HrQoL associated with effective treatment of rCDI. Because patients were untreated for their infection at the time of inclusion in the RCT, this study represents a unique opportunity to investigate the HrQoL associated with rCDI.

The loss of colonization resistance, typically with antibiotic use, can create an environment susceptible to CDI. The use of antibiotics to treat CDI further exacerbates intestinal dysbiosis, leading to higher recurrence risk after each subsequent episode of recurrence. The microbiota of patients with recurrent CDI is characterized by reduced community diversity and altered metabolomes, with delayed and incomplete recoveries when compared to nonrecurring patients. The restoration of the gut microbiome to a healthy state is essential for the prevention of recurrent CDI. This has led to the shift in treatment approaches with antibiotics used to target C. difficile directly followed by microbiota restoration therapy to replenish the microbiota and re-establish a metabolomic state consistent with a healthy gut (Fig. 1).

Fidaxomicin for recurrent CDI — panel view and practicality: The panel suggests the use of fidaxomicin as the preferred therapy for patients with recurrent CDI episode(s) to improve sustained response after therapy and notes that although fidaxomicin is orally administered and is generally well tolerated, the cost is prohibitive without adequate insurance coverage. More well-designed RCTs for patients with recurrent CDI, particularly multiply recurrent CDIs, are needed to improve the strength of recommendations.

Diagnosis of recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) — A CDI diagnosis requires acute-onset, clinically significant, new-onset diarrhea (eg, 3 or more unformed stools in 24 hours) with highly sensitive testing in combination with highly specific testing plus improvement of diarrhea with C difficile–directed antibiotics; a positive nucleic acid amplification test alone in the appropriate clinical context is also reasonable for making a CDI diagnosis. Recurrent CDI is typically defined as clinically significant diarrhea with a confirmatory positive test within 8 weeks of completing antibiotics for CDI. In patients with recurrent diarrhea after CDI treatment, consider alternative diagnoses, especially when symptoms are atypical or there is no response to vancomycin or fidaxomicin.

### Current and emerging management options for Clostridium difficile infection: what is the role of fidaxomicin? [^114fgwnP]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2012). Low credibility.

Until recently, treatment of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) was mainly limited to oral metronidazole and vancomycin, neither of which is optimal. Up to 25% of patients with CDI experience recurrence of infection within 30 days following treatment with these agents, while c. 45–65% of these patients experience further (and sometimes multiple) recurrences. Recurrent CDI represents a major treatment challenge for which new therapeutic options are sorely needed. Fidaxomicin is a first-in-class, oral macrocyclic antibiotic with targeted bactericidal activity against C. difficile and minimal effect on the constituents of the normal colonic microflora. This microflora-sparing activity allows for more rapid restoration of the normal colonic microflora in patients with CDI. In two separate, but almost identical, phase 3 clinical trials in which patients with CDI were treated with either fidaxomicin or vancomycin, fidaxomicin demonstrated superior clinical outcomes in comparison with the current best available treatment. While non-inferiority was demonstrated with respect to rates of clinical cure at end of treatment, significantly fewer fidaxomicin-treated patients experienced disease recurrence, which translated into clinically significant improvements in sustained clinical cure. Subsequent sub-population analyses suggest that these benefits extend to older patients, patients with severe CDI, renally impaired patients and patients with a prior episode of CDI. For CDI patients receiving concomitant antibiotics, fidaxomicin achieved significantly better rates of clinical cure and sustained clinical cure than vancomycin recipients. Fidaxomicin has a safety profile similar to oral vancomycin and appears generally well tolerated. Fidaxomicin represents an important addition to current treatment options for CDI.

Recurrence of C. difficile

Recurrent CDI is defined by the complete resolution of presenting symptoms on appropriate therapy, with subsequent relapse and return of symptoms within eight weeks of the initial episode completion of treatment. About 10–20% of CDI recur after an initial episode of C. difficile, but when a patient has had one recurrence, rates of further recurrences increase to 40–65%.

Impaired colonization resistance, allowing proliferation of C. difficile and impaired immune response demonstrated by lower levels of immunoglobulin G antibody to toxin A are thought to contribute to recurrence. Other risk factors for recurrent disease include advanced age, additional courses of antibiotics and/or chemotherapy, use of medications such as proton pump inhibitors, prolonged hospital stay, and prior episodes of recurrent CDI. There is evidence to show that a majority of recurrence of CDI is due to relapses of infection with the original strain rather than re-infection.

Management of initial recurrence

Both the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID) recommend treating the first recurrence of CDI with the same therapeutic agent used in the initial episode. Metronidazole is preferred for the treatment of non-severe initial recurrence. The use of oral vancomycin should be based the severity of disease at the time of first recurrence rather than its use in prior CDI. Fidaxomicin dosed at 200 mg b.i.d. for 10 days is an alternative agent for treatment of an initial recurrence of CDI. Fidaxomicin has similar efficacy to vancomycin in achieving a clinical response in patients with a first recurrence of CDI, however is exceptional in preventing a second recurrence within 28 days (19.7 versus 35.5%; 95%CI -30 to -0.3%); P = 0.045).

Bezlotoxumab efficacy by risk factor burden — In phase III trials, placebo participants with any risk factor for recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) had a 37.2% recurrence rate versus 20.9% without a risk factor, and recurrence risk increased with 1 versus 3 or more risk factors (31.3% vs 46.1%). Absolute rate reduction with bezlotoxumab was greatest with greater than or equal to 3 risk factors (−24.8%; 95% CI: −39.1% to −9.3%), with reductions in those with 2 risk factors (−14.2%; 95% CI: −24.0% to −4.1%) and 1 risk factor (−14.2%; 95% CI: −21.9% to −6.4%), compared with minimal effect in those with no risk factors (−2.1%; 95% CI: −11.1% to 6.9%). In primary CDI, the risk difference with at least 1 risk factor was −15.1% (95% CI: −22.0% to −8.1%) versus −1.5% (95% CI: −10.7% to 7.7%) without any risk factor. In a post hoc subgroup analysis of patients with recent CDI, the risk difference was −16.8% (95% CI: −29.2% to −4.5%) with 1 episode in the previous 6 months and −1.5% (95% CI: −33.1% to 1.4%) with 2 or more episodes; heterogeneity was I2: 0% and the pooled effect for a recurrent CDI episode in the last 6 months was −17.4% (95% CI: −27.5% to −7.3%).

### Health-related quality of life in patients with recurrentinfections [^113rCPHT]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The health-related quality of life (HrQoL) can be substantially affected in patients with recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection (rCDI) but the impact of effective treatment of the infection remains unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the HrQoL in patients with rCDI and estimate the gain in HrQoL associated with effective treatment of rCDI.

Methods

Patients' HrQoL was estimated based on EuroQol 5-Dimensions 3-Levels (EQ-5D-3L) questionnaires obtained from a Danish randomised controlled trial (RCT). In the RCT, 64 patients with rCDI were randomised to receive either vancomycin (n = 16), fidaxomicin (n = 24) or faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) preceded by vancomycin (n = 24). The primary outcome in the RCT was rCDI resolution. Patients were closely monitored during the RCT, and rescue FMT was offered to those who failed their primary treatment. Patients' HrQoL was measured at baseline and at 8- and 26-weeks follow-up. Linear regression analyses conditional on the differences between baseline and follow-up measurements were used to assess statistical significance (p < 0.05).

Results

Within 26weeks of follow-up, 13 (81%) patients treated with vancomycin, 12 (50%) patients treated with fidaxomicin, and 3 (13%) patients treated with FMT had a subsequent recurrence and received a rescue FMT. The average HrQoL for untreated patients with rCDI was 0.675. After receiving effective treatment, this value increased by 0.139 to 0.813 (p < 0.001) at week 8 and by 0.098 to 0.773 (p = 0.003) at week 26 of follow-up compared with baseline.

Conclusion

The HrQoL was adversely affected in patients with an active episode of rCDI but increased substantially after receiving an effective treatment algorithm in which rescue FMT was provided in case of a primary treatment failure.

Trial Registration

The RCT was preregistered at EudraCT (j.no. 2015–003004–24, https://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/ctr-search/trial/2015–003004–24/results) and at ClinicalTrials.gov (study identifier NCT02743234, https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02743234).

### Fecal microbiota transplantation versus vancomycin for primaryInfection: a randomized controlled trial [^112fqaAu]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is recommended for recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI), but its role in primary CDI is unclear.

Objective

To investigate the efficacy and safety of FMT in primary CDI.

Design

Randomized, open-label, noninferiority, multicenter trial. (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03796650).

Setting

Hospitals and primary care facilities in Norway.

Patients

Adults with CDI (C difficile toxin in stool and ≥ 3 loose stools daily) and no previous CDI within 365 days before enrollment.

Intervention

FMT without antibiotic pretreatment versus oral vancomycin, 125 mg 4 times daily for 10 days.

Measurements

The primary end point was clinical cure (firm stools or < 3 bowel movements daily) at day 14 and no disease recurrence within 60 days with the assigned treatment alone.

Results

Of 104 randomly assigned patients, 100 received FMT or the first dose of vancomycin and were eligible for analysis. Clinical cure and no disease recurrence within 60 days without additional treatment was observed in 34 of 51 patients (66.7%) with FMT versus 30 of 49 (61.2%) with vancomycin (difference, 5.4 percentage points [95.2% CI, -13.5 to 24.4 percentage points]; P for noninferiority < 0.001, rejecting the hypothesis that response to FMT is 25 percentage points lower than response to vancomycin). Eleven patients in the FMT group and 4 in the vancomycin group had additional C difficile treatment. Clinical cure at day 14 and no recurrence with or without additional treatment was observed in 40 of 51 patients (78.4%) with FMT and 30 of 49 (61.2%) with vancomycin (difference, 17.2 percentage points [95.2% CI, -0.7 to 35.1 percentage points]). No significant differences in adverse events were observed between groups.

Limitations

Open-label design and reliance on clinical end points.

Conclusion

FMT may be considered as first-line therapy in primary CDI.

Nonsevere Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) — initial episode management includes the following and supporting evidence: "We recommend that oral vancomycin 125 mg 4 times daily for 10 days be used to treat an initial episode of nonsevere CDI (strong recommendation, low quality of evidence)". "We recommend that oral fidaxomicin 200 mg twice daily for 10 days be used for an initial episode of nonsevere CDI (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence)". "Oral metronidazole 500 mg 3 times daily for 10 days may be considered for treatment of an initial nonsevere CDI in low-risk patients (strong recommendation/moderate quality of evidence)". In comparative trials, fidaxomicin showed similar clinical cure but lower recurrence than vancomycin: "cure rates with fidaxomicin (82.1%) were similar to vancomycin (88.6%). The rate of recurrence within 30 days, however, was significantly lower with fidaxomicin (13.0% vs 26.6%, P = 0.02)", and a second RCT found "no significant difference in clinical cure (76.2% vs 70.5%, P = 0.473), but lower recurrence rates with fidaxomicin (8.3% vs 32.6%, P < 0.05)". A Veteran Administration analysis found "no statistically significant difference in the combined outcome of clinical failure or recurrence between 213 fidaxomicin treatment courses (31.9%) and 639 vancomycin treatment courses (25.5%)", with mortality "30-day (10.8% vs 11.7%), 90-day (22.5% vs 21.9%), and 180-day mortality rates (29.1% vs 29.1%)" similar. A Cochrane review concluded that "moderate quality evidence suggests that vancomycin is superior to metronidazole and fidaxomicin is superior to vancomycin", while noting "The differences in effectiveness between these antibiotics were not large and the advantage of metronidazole is its far lower cost". For follow-on therapy, rifaximin trials used "400 mg t.i.d. for 20 days" with recurrence "decreased from 31% to 15%", and another trial used "400 mg t.i.d. for 14 days and then 200 mg t.i.d. for an additional 14 days" with recurrence "from 30% to 16% (P = 0.06)", but concerns include "30%–50% resistance rates", and the authors "do not currently recommend its routine use".

Bezlotoxumab (BEZ) for prevention of recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection — recommendation and key evidence — states: We suggest bezlotoxumab (BEZ) be considered for prevention of CDI recurrence in patients who are at high risk of recurrence (conditional recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). Considering benefit concentration, we recommend this drug be considered for patients aged 65 years or older with at least one of: second episode within the past 6 months, immunocompromised, or severe CDI. In pooled MODIFY I/II analyses (modified intention-to-treat), sustained cure at 12 weeks was higher with BEZ 63.5% vs 53.7% among 2,655 adults, with an adjusted difference of 9.7 percentage points (95% CI 4.8–14.5; P < 0.0001) and a number needed to treat of 10. Post hoc, BEZ did not show significant benefits in patients without risk factors 29.0% vs 18.8%; the greatest absolute difference occurred in those with a history of CDI and ≥ 1 other risk factor (−35.7% [95% CI −60.5% to −2.8%]), and the number needed to treat to prevent 1 recurrent CDI was only 6 for patients aged 65 years or older and for those with ≥ 1 CDI episode within the past 6 months. Cost-effectiveness models reported an ICER of $19,824 per QALY overall, $15,252/QALY in patients aged 65 years or older, and $12,597/QALY in immunocompromised patients. There are no absolute contraindications, but caution is advised for patients with a history of congestive heart failure; trials observed higher heart failure incidence 2% vs 1%, more treatment-emergent adverse events 83.8% vs 70.2%, serious adverse events 53.4% vs 48%, deaths 19.5% vs 12.5%, and cardiovascular deaths 8 [14.3%] vs 4 [6.8%]; based on these data, we do not recommend BEZ use in patients with a history of heart failure and that it be used with caution in patients with severe underlying cardiovascular comorbidities.

Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) FMT early failure and risk factors — Among 167 patients with recurrent CDI, 16.7% experienced early FMT failure, with most (86%) within 4 weeks and 14% between 4 and 8 weeks; in a multicenter cohort of 328 patients, early FMT failure (within 1 month) was 18.6%. Risks of failure included FMT for severe or fulminant CDI, inpatient status, and complicated psychiatric hospitalization; previous CDI-related hospitalization predicted failure, and patients with severe CDI were more likely to require multiple FMTs to achieve cure.
