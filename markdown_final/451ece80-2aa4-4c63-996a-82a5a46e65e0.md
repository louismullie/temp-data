## Question

What are the specific risks associated with positive HLA antibodies in organ transplantation?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the specific risks associated with positive HLA antibodies in organ transplantation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to define and quantify HLA sensitization and donor-specific antibodies. Then, I should verify pre-transplant risks, including donor pool constraints and waitlist morbidity. Next, I will examine perioperative and early post-transplant risks such as hyperacute and early AMR, PGD, and early graft dysfunction. After that, I need to assess late risks like chronic AMR, CAV, and graft failure. I will then consider organ-specific nuances for heart, lung, liver, and kidney transplantation. Finally, I should review risk stratification tools, mitigation strategies, and evidence gaps to synthesize a practical clinical takeaway [^115SjsY9] [^116YNv5T].

> Let me first confirm the definitions and measurement framework, because misclassification here will propagate errors downstream. Positive HLA antibodies reflect alloimmunization to HLA class I and/or class II antigens, with donor-specific antibodies (DSA) directed against mismatched donor HLA; solid-phase single antigen bead assays quantify strength via mean fluorescence intensity (MFI), and calculated panel reactive antibody (cPRA) estimates the proportion of incompatible donors, while complement-fixing assays (C1q, C3d/C4d) and crossmatch modalities (CDC, flow) assess functional relevance and risk of injury, though MFI is semiquantitative and susceptible to prozone and bead saturation effects [^115SjsY9] [^112qfzJW] [^115B2saD].

> I need to check pre-transplant access and timing risks next. High cPRA substantially shrinks the compatible donor pool and prolongs waiting time; many centers consider cPRA above 50–80% as a major barrier, and cPRA above 95% can render transplant unfeasible in some contexts, increasing waitlist morbidity and mortality, particularly for thoracic candidates on mechanical circulatory support or ECMO bridge strategies [^116YNv5T] [^115uuehY] [^111kVoNS]. Hold on, I should verify pediatric and adult heart data: sensitized patients face longer waits and higher risk of waitlist complications, and the proportion of sensitized candidates is rising with MCS exposure, reinforcing the clinical urgency of addressing sensitization pre-transplant [^116YNv5T].

> Now, perioperative and early post-transplant risks. Hyperacute rejection can occur within hours when high-titer, complement-fixing DSA are present, leading to immediate graft dysfunction; early AMR within the first month is linked to preformed or rapidly developing DSA and correlates with capillary injury, hemodynamic compromise, and need for inotropic or mechanical support, with C1q positivity strengthening the association with clinically relevant injury [^1117SDwZ] [^111uxFFh] [^115SjsY9]. Wait, let me verify lung-specific early injury signals: sensitized lung recipients have more ventilator days and higher rates of primary graft dysfunction, and peri-transplant DSA are implicated in early allograft dysfunction even when crossmatch is negative, underscoring the limits of crossmatch alone [^11479pS7] [^112mv51h].

> Next, I should review late risks, because these drive long-term outcomes. De novo DSA, especially class II and persistent antibodies, associate with chronic AMR, accelerated cardiac allograft vasculopathy, and reduced survival; late DSA after year 1 carries particularly adverse prognostic weight, and complement-fixing DSA with C4d/C3d deposition track with graft dysfunction and mortality in multiple cohorts [^111ZACH3] [^113tvSU5] [^116QRQUS]. Hold on, I should verify pediatric data: in pediatrics, de novo DSA are increasingly recognized as prognostically important, and although absolute event rates differ, the directionality of risk mirrors adult experience, reinforcing the need for longitudinal DSA surveillance and risk stratification [^111ZACH3] [^1146niJj].

> I will now examine organ-specific nuances, starting with heart transplantation. Pre-transplant PRA above 10% or donor-directed antibodies at transplant identify patients at risk for suboptimal outcomes; virtual crossmatch expands donor access but may miss risk from shared epitopes or low-level DSA, and many centers use MFI around 5,000 as a pragmatic threshold for "avoid" decisions, though crossing lower-level DSA with careful planning and negative CDC can be acceptable in experienced programs [^115SjsY9] [^115aUu77] [^114e91h5]. Let me reconsider the role of non-HLA antibodies: anti-endothelial, anti-vimentin, and anti-MICA antibodies have been linked to AMR and CAV, and should be considered when graft dysfunction occurs without detectable HLA DSA, though assays and thresholds remain limited [^113Pa7RF] [^117DpR2e].

> For lung transplantation, I should confirm that sensitization increases risks of early graft dysfunction, BOS, and mortality; desensitization can mitigate some early events, but standardized diagnostic criteria for pulmonary AMR were historically lacking, complicating risk attribution and management decisions, and recent consensus efforts aim to harmonize definitions and phenotypes to improve care pathways [^112mv51h] [^116J5g51] [^115tuB9E]. But wait, what if the crossmatch is negative? Even with a negative crossmatch, low-level DSA can still contribute to injury, so serial antibody monitoring and integration with clinical and histologic data remain essential in lung recipients [^notfound].

> For liver transplantation, I should double-check the distinct immunobiology. The liver is relatively tolerant, yet de novo DSA occur in a meaningful minority and associate with rejection and graft loss; class II DSA and complement-binding antibodies correlate with chronic AMR and fibrosis, and although ABO-incompatible livers can be performed safely, AMR risk rises when DSA are present, necessitating vigilant immunosuppression and monitoring strategies [^115PnYfH] [^11163Uku]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought liver AMR was uniformly rare outside ABO incompatibility; that overstates the case — while less common than in heart/kidney, liver AMR is increasingly recognized and clinically consequential when DSA persist or rise, particularly beyond year 1 [^115PnYfH].

> For kidney transplantation, I need to ensure I align with guideline-based practice. Preformed DSA and positive crossmatch increase risk of hyperacute and early AMR, and desensitization terminology should be used precisely because HLA-incompatible transplantation is not synonymous with formal antibody-removal desensitization; randomized data have not shown improved long-term survival with desensitization, so decisions should integrate access barriers, donor quality, and patient-specific factors rather than reflexive antibody avoidance alone [^113RtWFB] [^112bC1RW]. Hold on, I should verify assay guidance: solid-phase assays are preferred for HLA antibody detection, and routine complement-binding or non-HLA testing is not recommended outside specific contexts, reflecting limited standardization and uncertain treatment thresholds [^112bC1RW].

> Next, I should review risk stratification tools and thresholds, keeping in mind their limitations. Many centers stratify DSA risk by MFI bands: low risk below 5,000, moderate 5,000–8,000, and high above 8,000, but MFI is not a titer and must be interpreted alongside complement-fixation, DSA persistence, and clinical context; C1q positivity correlates with cytotoxic crossmatch and early AMR, and epitope/eplet mismatch burden is being explored to predict de novo DSA and AMR, though not yet integrated into allocation policy [^111zmDUS] [^115SjsY9] [^11452LdP]. I should confirm crossmatch performance: virtual crossmatch has high negative predictive value but lower positive predictive value, and in complex sensitization a prospective crossmatch is warranted; some centers use surrogate crossmatches to adjudicate lower-level DSA, but practice varies and standardization remains a priority [^114e91h5] [^117L3tzM].

> I will now examine mitigation strategies and their evidentiary footing. Desensitization with plasmapheresis or immunoadsorption plus IVIG, with rituximab or bortezomib as adjuncts, can reduce antibody burden and expand donor access, but infectious complications and uncertain long-term benefit temper enthusiasm; randomized trials are lacking, and responses vary by antibody titer and class, so patient selection and timing are critical [^115VhGAB] [^115gakMW] [^116TskUR]. Let me verify peri-transplant protocols: some centers crossing moderate-high binding DSA require a negative prospective CDC crossmatch and deploy complement blockade or intensified induction, acknowledging that mitigation may temporize but not necessarily improve long-term outcomes, reinforcing the need for careful risk-benefit discussions [^117L3tzM] [^116bBmAo].

> Next, I should review surveillance recommendations to ensure I am not missing time-sensitive windows. Pre-transplant, sensitized patients should have HLA antibodies monitored every 3 months and within 1–2 weeks after sensitizing events such as transfusion or infection; post-transplant, DSA surveillance at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months, then annually for low-risk patients, with closer intervals for sensitized recipients, and biopsy with immunostaining when DSA accompany graft dysfunction or rising titers, are prudent to detect subclinical AMR early [^1178sKxF] [^111n4H3P] [^113ReEMQ]. Hold on, I should verify that asymptomatic DSA alone does not mandate biopsy; consensus supports biopsy when DSA trends upward or are accompanied by abnormal imaging, hemodynamics, or molecular signals, aligning serology with tissue injury evidence [^112TEqXG].

> Finally, I need to synthesize the clinical implications and acknowledge uncertainties. Positive HLA antibodies confer risks across the transplant continuum: pre-transplant access constraints and waitlist hazards, perioperative hyperacute and early AMR with hemodynamic compromise, and late chronic AMR, CAV, and graft failure; risk is modulated by antibody class, strength, complement-fixing capacity, persistence, and epitope load, and by organ-specific tolerance features, but standardized thresholds and therapies remain elusive, necessitating individualized, center-specific protocols grounded in evolving consensus and ongoing research [^116YNv5T] [^116n4trA] [^11452LdP]. I should double-check that my bottom line aligns with guidance: a holistic, risk-stratified approach integrating virtual and prospective crossmatch, complement-fixation assessment, serial DSA monitoring, and judicious desensitization, with transparent patient counseling about uncertainties, is the most defensible path forward while we await stronger prospective data and policy integration [^116n4trA] [^114Y2oJH].

Positive HLA antibodies in organ transplantation carry major risks: they **reduce the donor pool and prolong wait times** [^117L3tzM] [^114KxXuw] and **increase the risk of antibody-mediated rejection (AMR)** [^1117SDwZ], which can present as hyperacute, acute, or chronic rejection and is linked to graft dysfunction and loss [^115PnYfH]. They also **raise the risk of cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV)** [^113tvSU5] and early graft dysfunction, including primary graft dysfunction in lung transplantation [^112mv51h] [^11479pS7]. Risk varies with antibody strength (MFI), complement-binding (C1q/C3d) [^112qfzJW], and persistence; high-risk features warrant intensified monitoring, desensitization, and selective donor acceptance strategies [^111zmDUS] [^111iuSu2].

---

## Pre-transplant risks

### Reduced donor pool and prolonged waiting time

Highly sensitized patients face a **smaller compatible donor pool** [^117L3tzM], which prolongs waiting time and increases waitlist morbidity and mortality [^116YNv5T]. High cPRA (> 50–80%) is associated with prolonged waiting and reduced transplant probability [^115uuehY].

---

### Difficulty in finding compatible donors

Patients with broad HLA sensitization have **fewer compatible donors**, complicating matching and increasing the risk of positive crossmatches [^117L3tzM] [^114KxXuw].

---

## Perioperative and early post-transplant risks

### Hyperacute rejection

Preformed donor-specific antibodies (DSA) can cause **hyperacute rejection** within minutes to hours, leading to immediate graft failure [^notfound].

---

### Acute antibody-mediated rejection (AMR)

DSA are strongly associated with **early AMR**, which presents with graft dysfunction, capillary injury, and complement deposition (C4d) [^111uxFFh]. AMR is a major cause of early graft dysfunction and loss [^notfound].

---

### Primary graft dysfunction (PGD)

In lung transplantation, preformed HLA antibodies increase the risk of **PGD**, characterized by severe early graft dysfunction and prolonged mechanical ventilation [^112mv51h] [^11479pS7].

---

## Long-term post-transplant risks

### Chronic antibody-mediated rejection (CAMR)

Persistent or de novo DSA are linked to **CAMR**, leading to progressive graft dysfunction and failure [^115PnYfH].

---

### Cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV)

In heart transplantation, DSA — especially class II and complement-binding antibodies — **increase CAV risk**, a leading cause of late graft failure [^113tvSU5] [^1141BKSt].

---

### Graft loss and mortality

DSA are associated with **higher graft loss and mortality** across organs, with the strongest links in kidney and heart transplantation [^115PnYfH] [^111ZACH3].

---

## Factors influencing risk severity

Several factors modulate the **severity of HLA antibody–mediated risk**:

| **Factor** | **Influence on risk** |
|-|-|
| Antibody strength (MFI) | Higher MFI (> 5,000–10,000) correlates with greater risk of AMR and graft loss [^notfound] |
| Complement-binding (C1q/C3d) | Complement-binding antibodies markedly increase AMR and graft loss risk [^112qfzJW] [^116Rcpkr] |
| Antibody persistence | Persistent DSA confers higher risk than transient antibodies [^111ZACH3] [^113yyCz1] |
| Antibody class | Class II DSA (especially HLA-DQ) are strongly associated with AMR and graft loss [^111ZACH3] [^11452LdP] |
| Timing of DSA appearance | Late-emerging DSA (> 1 year post-transplant) carry higher risk than early DSA [^111ZACH3] [^113yyCz1] |

---

## Clinical management strategies

Given these risks, **centers employ several strategies**:

- **Desensitization**: Plasmapheresis, IVIG, rituximab, and bortezomib reduce antibody levels and enable transplantation [^111zmDUS] [^115gakMW].
- **Virtual crossmatching**: Identifies compatible donors and reduces positive crossmatches [^117L3tzM] [^115aUu77].
- **Selective donor acceptance**: Some centers accept low-level DSA (MFI < 5,000–7,000) with careful monitoring [^114e91h5] [^115zkCZj].
- **Post-transplant monitoring**: Regular DSA surveillance and early treatment of AMR are recommended [^113ReEMQ] [^111ZACH3].

---

Positive HLA antibodies **significantly increase risks** before and after transplantation, including longer waiting times, AMR, CAV, and graft loss. Risk is driven by antibody strength, complement-binding, and persistence; management includes desensitization, virtual crossmatching, and selective donor acceptance with close post-transplant monitoring [^116n4trA].

DSA risk features and non-HLA antibodies — associations with outcomes: DSA characteristics such as DSA that remain at higher dilutions, complement binding antibodies, dnDSA (vs preformed antibodies), late rising DSA (vs early), persistently elevated DSA (vs transient), and dnDSA developing against HLA-DQ antigens (vs non-HLA-DQ antigens) have been associated with adverse outcomes, and synergy of both elevated dnDSA and non-HLA (AT1R-ab) antibodies results in an increased risk of rejection as compared to elevated levels of either antibody, although current evidence on non-HLA antibodies remains limited with no well-determined thresholds for positivity. Recently, Gates et al identified a total of 155 non-HLA antibodies in AMR patients, with responses toward 43 high-prevalence antigens, and longitudinal sera from a multicenter cohort (samples: n = 477 no rejection; n = 69 rejection) identified 18 non-HLA antibodies associated with rejection (p < 0.1) including 4 newly identified non-HLA antigenic targets (DEXI, EMCN, LPHN1, and SSB), yet an independent causal role of non-HLA antibodies in contributing to graft injury is yet to be fully determined.

Antibodies and antibody-mediated rejection in heart transplantation — background and consensus scope indicate that the number of sensitized candidates has been rising due to mechanical circulatory support (MCS) devices and prior sensitizing events. Heart transplant patients developing antihuman leukocyte antigen (HLA) antibodies have a longer wait time and are at risk for waitlist morbidity/mortality; detection of post-transplant circulating antibodies is frequently correlated to biopsy-proven antibody-mediated rejection (AMR), and post-transplant survival may be affected with higher risk of allograft failure and mortality. Management of detected antibodies before and after transplantation remains variable and based on limited objective data. A consensus conference on April 18, 2023 in Denver, CO included 52 US and 23 international multidisciplinary experts; objectives were to apprise the community on the role of HLA, non-HLA, ABO antibodies and biopsy-proven AMR, discuss risk factors and strategies for risk stratification, identify effective modes of therapy before, during, and after transplant, and explore a framework and criteria for potential higher-status listing or priority access for highly sensitized candidates. Participants were divided into 3 breakout groups, and 7 questions arose from 5 pre-meeting conference calls.

Donor selection for sensitized patients — background guidance notes that the presence of HLA antibodies in heart transplant candidates imposes substantial limitations on the donor pool and can significantly increase waiting time, and that patients exhibiting positive transplantation crossmatch to donor HLA are at high risk for rejection and mortality. The Sensitization in Transplantation Assessment of Risk (STAR) Working Group recommended comprehensive HLA typing, including information regarding major HLA loci: HLA-A, - B, -C, -DRB1, -DRB3/4/5, -DQA1/DQB1, and -DPA1/DPB1 for both the organ donor and recipient. The VXM is recommended to avoid a positive crossmatch; if the VXM cannot be performed or in the event of recent sensitization, a prospective crossmatch is recommended, which can be performed by 2 cell-based methods: a CDC crossmatch assay and a flow cytometric crossmatch assay. Solid-phase immunoassays using flow cytrometry have much greater sensitivity in detecting donor-specific HLA antibodies; however, only the CDC crossmatch detects the killing of cells, and a majority of programs will not accept a donor having a prospective positive flow cytometry crossmatch. It has been suggested to perform a prospective CDC crossmatch when crossing moderate-high binding DSA (defined as MFI > 5,000), and programs crossing high-binding DSA have utilized novel immunosuppression protocols (complement blockade therapy) as long as a prospective CDC crossmatch is negative. Before transplant, some programs may order a surrogate CDC or flow cytometric crossmatch to better assess the ability of DSA to cause harm; if this surrogate CDC crossmatch is negative for cell killing or the flow cytometric crossmatch is moderate or less in strength, then this antibody is not avoided.

Heart transplantation — summary of consensus themes underscores holistic, risk-stratified management of antibodies and AMR. The main theme was to adopt a holistic approach and risk-stratify patients, with participants identifying cut-offs to risk stratify and manage pretransplant-detected antibodies and underlining antibodies' attributes as essential adjuncts for risk assessment tools. Special donor considerations and the need to perform a physical prospective crossmatch were discussed, and unmet needs in pediatric and ABO-incompatible heart transplantation were highlighted. Discussants delved into current desensitization approaches, perioperative management, post-transplant antibody monitoring, and maintenance immunosuppression therapy strategies in highly sensitized patients. For post-transplant DSA, participants elaborated on the clinical relevance of DSA including trending characteristics, clinical manifestations, imaging findings, and molecular profiling. Future considerations included organ allocation policies, standardization of HLA reporting, and incorporating DSA in clinical trial end-points, aiming for a more standardized pathway for evaluating patients for heart transplantation and post-transplant monitoring and to pave the way for future studies.

Antibodies and antibody-mediated rejection in heart transplantation — pretransplant risk stratification and desensitization are outlined as follows: Stratify antibody risk by mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) in the undiluted assay with Low risk < 5,000 MFI, Moderate risk 5,000–8,000 MFI, and High risk > 8,000 MFI. Other factors to stratify antibody risk may include the patient's antibody attributes, clinical factors, and infrastructure. Consider desensitizing if cPRA is > 50% with the goal of pretransplant desensitization therapy to lower the cPRA to broaden the donor pool and minimize the risk of post-transplant AMR, using commonly utilized combinations including plasmapheresis/immunoadsorption, IVIG, rituximab, and/or bortezomib. There is a need for precision in defining ABO-related histocompatibility to analyze risk and benefit across ages. HLA-DSA before and after transplantation are of clinical relevance in pediatric patients similar to adults, though the extent, impact, and approach may be different. Virtual crossmatch might not be applicable with complicated HLA antibody interpretations and a prospective crossmatch may be warranted. Crossing DSA in experienced centers may be considered for sensitized patients but should account for patient characteristics, antibody attributes, and biological significance.

### The management of antibodies in heart transplantation: an ISHLT consensus document [^113g57YF]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2018). Medium credibility.

ISHLT consensus on antibodies in heart transplantation — antibodies remain a serious cause of morbidity and mortality for patients both before and after heart transplantation, and the presence of circulating antibodies in heart transplantation (called sensitization) impacts clinical outcomes. Patients awaiting transplant who possess antibodies against human leukocyte antigen are disadvantaged by having to wait longer to receive an organ from a suitably matched donor, and the number of pre-sensitized patients has been increasing, a trend that is likely due to the increased use of mechanical circulatory support devices. Even patients who are not pre-sensitized can go on to produce donor-specific antibodies after transplant, which are associated with worse outcomes. The difficulty in managing antibodies is uncertainty over which antibodies are of clinical relevance, which patients to treat, and which treatments are most effective and safe, and there is a distinct lack of data from prospective trials. An international consensus conference was organized and attended by 103 participants from 75 centers to debate contentious issues, determine the best practices, and formulate ideas for future research on antibodies.

Allosensitization/HLA mismatch — pediatric LTx: Pretransplant allosensitization to human leukocyte antigens increases waitlist time and risk for allograft dysfunction and mortality after LTx, and increased donor-recipient HLA mismatching increases risk for acute cellular rejection, CLAD, and mortality in LTx recipients. Despite these challenges, LTx can be successfully performed in children even with a perioperative positive cross match, yet threshold antibody levels for donor organ acceptance and optimal detection for clinically significant donor specific anti-HLA antibodies have not been determined, and there is wide variability in desensitization and treatment approaches with insufficient evidence to determine best practice. A reported approach used repeated IgA- and IgM-enriched intravenous immunoglobulin with plasmapheresis before infusions and a single anti-CD20 dose, and multicenter studies for children are urgently needed.

Heart transplantation — HLA epitope/eplet mismatch relevance and DSA endpoints are highlighted as follows. High-risk HLA-DQ epitopes have been identified in patients with persistent dnDSA and have also been associated with AMR, and higher levels of epitope mismatches such as HLA-A and -B, HLA-DR, and HLA-DPB1 have been linked to worse outcomes including AMR and graft loss; incorporating HLA epitope/eplet mismatch scores in current allocation systems could potentially help enhance donor selection and improve clinical outcomes. However, the absence and cost of high-resolution HLA typing data, variability in the definition and calculation of eplet mismatching algorithms, and a paucity of large clinical studies continue to hamper the development of a priority policy. Given the clinical relevance of DSA to allograft prognosis and risk stratification, post-transplant DSA should be considered as an end-point in future clinical trials. Establishing regional centers to manage sensitized patients may provide access to advanced therapeutic and diagnostic modalities and could further enhance short- and long-term outcomes.

Compatibility testing — evaluation steps before living kidney donation: Donor ABO blood typing should be performed twice before donation to reduce the risk of unintended blood type incompatible transplantation, and donor blood group A subtype testing should be performed when donation is planned to recipients with anti-A antibodies. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing for major histocompatibility complex (MHC) Class I (A, B, C) and Class II (DP, DQ, DR) should be performed in donor candidates and their intended recipients, and donor-specific anti-HLA antibodies should be assessed in intended recipients.

Patient education and immunosuppression withdrawal after graft failure — The commentary notes the lack of KDIGO recommendations on patient education regarding sensitization events and on immunosuppression withdrawal in patients with a failing allograft who are at high risk of developing HLA antibodies after withdrawal; it states that tailoring withdrawal is necessary based on residual kidney function, patient age, risk of side effects, and likelihood of a repeat transplant within a reasonable time, and that the KDOQI work group strongly believes all transplant centers should focus heavily on educating transplant recipients about sensitizing events and the role of nonadherence in HLA sensitization to improve chances of a repeat transplant.

### AASLD AST practice guideline on adult liver transplantation: diagnosis and management of graft-related complications [^115PnYfH]. Liver Transplantation (2025). High credibility.

Adult liver transplantation (LT) — de novo donor-specific antibodies (DSA) incidence, risk factors, and outcomes: In LT recipients, incidence is 12.2% at 1 year, 13.4% at 5 years, and 19.5% at 10 years, and DSAs are usually directed toward class II human leukocyte antigen (HLA) antigens. Risk factors include female sex, longer time between transplant and DSA screening, lower total tacrolimus exposure, and purposeful lowering of immunosuppression; suboptimal immunosuppression and non-adherence increase the risk of developing de novo DSA. A meta-analysis of 15 studies reported de novo DSA with a cutoff of 3,000 mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) associated with increased graft rejection (OR 6.43, 95% CI 3.17 to 13.04, p < 0.001, I^2 = 50%) and with graft loss and CDR (OR 3.61, 95% CI 1.94 to 6.71, p < 0.001, I^2 = 58%) versus recipients without de novo DSA, with poorer outcomes consistent across subgroups and sensitivity analyses. A prospective study comparing 45 matched DSA-positive to 45 DSA-negative recipients found subtle differences in inflammation and unique fibrosis patterns despite normal or near normal liver tests and led to the development of the chronic antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) score. There is no agreed upon MFI cutoff that correlates with chronic AMR, although most studies have shown correlations with AMR at MFI > 5,000; de novo or preformed C1q+ and C3d+-binding antibodies to HLA Class II antigens have also been associated with AMR, and in long-term survivors the presence of HLA and non-HLA DSA portends increased liver allograft inflammation, fibrosis, and decreased survival.

HLA antibody detection — assay types and comparative characteristics are outlined for pre- and post-transplant use. Several methods can be used pre-transplant to assess sensitization and risk of antibody-mediated rejection (AMR), post-transplant for monitoring donor-specific antibodies (DSA), and for monitoring the efficacy of desensitization therapy. The complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) assay is the oldest, most variable, least sensitive, least specific, but most clinically relevant method; recipient serum is mixed with donor T- and B-lymphocytes and complement, a cytotoxic reaction suggests the presence of complement-fixing DSA, and sensitivity is enhanced by the addition of anti-human globulin (AHG). Bead-based platforms report mean fluorescence intensity (MFI), and MFI does not represent antibody titer but reflects antibody–antigen binding strength or bead saturation; diluting sera can eliminate effects of IgM or complement 1 (C1) that interfere with binding. Flow panel reactive antibody (PRA) testing uses bead panels representing Class I (A, B, C) or Class II (DR, DP, DQ) HLA, is often used for initial screening with a qualitative positive or negative result on an incomplete panel, is more sensitive than CDC but lacks allele specificity other than class, underestimates PRA, requires expert interpretation, and it is possible to miss antibodies. Luminex (LMX) PRA uses panels with a full cell's equivalent of Class I or II HLA, is more sensitive than CDC but less sensitive than single antigen beads (SAB), is non-specific, underestimates PRA, requires expert analysis, and broadly reactive sera can be difficult if not impossible to analyze, though it leaves antigens in their theoretically native configuration. LMX SAB IgG uses beads coated with a unique HLA antigen/allele on each bead, detects bound antibody with an anti-IgG antibody, and SAB are the most sensitive, specific, and unambiguous of the bead assays.

ISHLT consensus — research priorities for antibodies in transplantation emphasize that randomized, controlled trials are needed to assess the benefit of treatment in both pre- and post-transplant sensitized patients, ideally using the same desensitization protocols to enable comparability. Other future studies will include identifying which antibodies require treatment, assessing sensitization in MCS device patients, evaluating the role of non-HLA antibodies, and validating the suggested causal link between antibodies and CAV. An antibody registry is suggested to assist in the facilitation of research.

### The management of antibodies in heart transplantation: an ISHLT consensus document [^113ReEMQ]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2018). Medium credibility.

ISHLT consensus — assays and monitoring for antibodies in heart transplantation states that solid-phase assays, such as the Luminex SAB assay, are recommended to detect circulating antibodies, and that standardization of solid-phase assay procedures is needed to reduce variability so they can be used in multicenter clinical trials. Patients at risk for sub-optimal outcome post-transplant are defined as having a PRA > 10% or donor-directed antibodies at the time of transplantation. Post-transplantation monitoring for donor-specific antibodies (DSA) should be performed at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months post-operatively, with low-risk patients monitored annually after the first year and sensitized patients more frequently. DSA testing should be performed for any patient presenting with symptoms or signs of graft dysfunction.

Desensitization terminology and evidence — The commentary cautions that the term "desensitization" needs careful use, noting that transplant in the context of preformed donor-specific antibody (DSA) and/or positive crossmatch does not always include antibody-removal therapy and therefore HLA-incompatible transplant is not synonymous with desensitization; it states that data to inform desensitization practices are inadequate, randomized controlled trials have not shown improved long-term allograft survival with desensitization, several retrospective studies report acceptable short-term results without specific desensitization when DSA levels are low or flow cytometric crossmatch is positive, and historically some transplants occurred with low levels of alloantibody.

Anti-HLA antibodies in the pediatric recipient — the importance of circulating anti-HLA antibodies in the development of AMR is well established, although the relationship between AMR and DSAs, nonspecific antibodies, and the timing of antibody formation is still unclear; a United Network for Organ Sharing database analysis identified risk factors for PRA in children with end-stage heart failure that potentially increase AMR risk after transplantation; overall, an elevated pretransplantation PRA (> 10%) was detected in 11% of the pediatric population.

Risk factors for antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) in heart transplant recipients — reported factors include elevated panel reactive antibody (PRA), cytomegalovirus seropositivity, prior mechanical circulatory support, history of retransplantation, multiparity, and a positive T-cell flow-cytometry crossmatch; women have a disproportionately higher incidence, comprising up to 50% of de novo heart transplant recipients with AMR in reported series. There is now evidence of a relationship between circulating anti-HLA antibody after transplantation and histological evidence of AMR.

Immunological management before lung transplantation — Testing for presence of HLA antibodies before lung transplantation is of fundamental importance, and in most centers calculated panel-reactive antibodies (cPRA) are used for risk stratification; antibody mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) and complement-fixation properties may contribute to outcome variation among HLA antibody positive or pre-sensitized recipients. Commonly, a cPRA above 50% is associated with a prolonged time on lung transplant waiting lists and lower probability of receiving a transplant, and many centers have successfully implemented desensitization protocols for patients with high (> 80–95%) cPRA.

Topic 5 — Evaluation of allosensitization and sensitized heart transplant recipients: Screening panel reactive antibodies (PRA) should be performed in all heart transplant candidates, and when PRA is elevated (≥ 10%) further evaluation is recommended; the update notes 'Continuing approval without change'.The specificity of circulating antibodies should be determined with a solid-phase assay such as flow-cytometry, if possible, in a regional certified human leukocyte antigen laboratory. Anti-HLA class I and II specificities should be defined and each transplant center must define the antibody threshold for unacceptable rejection risk; a mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) less than 5,000 is generally considered to be an acceptable threshold (Class I, Level of Evidence C). It is recommended that calculated PRA (c-PRA) based on recipient antibody specificity and population antigenic prevalence be determined and reported to aid in matching (Class I, Level of Evidence C). The virtual crossmatch should be routinely used to increase the donor pool for sensitized recipients (Class I, Level of Evidence C). The complement fixation capability of detected antibodies may be beneficial as it may identify more clinically relevant antibodies, and this can be assessed through specific complement-fixing assays or sera dilution, with higher antibody titers associated with higher likelihood of complement fixing capacities (Class IIa, Level of Evidence C). If known, presence of non-HLA antibodies such as MICA or angiotensin II type 1 receptor-activating antibodies and antibodies to self-antigens are reasonable to report and consider when assessing AMR risk (Class IIa, Level of Evidence C). Prospective or virtual crossmatch should be performed in recipients with PRA > 10% (Class I, Level of Evidence C). A complete patient sensitization history including previous PRA determinations, blood transfusions, pregnancies, implant of homograft materials, previous transplantation, and use of a VAD is required to assess the risk of heart allograft anti-body-mediated rejection (Class IIa, Level of Evidence C).

Surveillance protocol guidance — centers were recommended to develop surveillance protocols based on their specific clinical and research indications, and protocols should include a minimum of immunostaining of 2 specimens during the first month and afterward, according to the circulating DSA evaluation schedule. Results of initial staining should guide subsequent immunostaining. For centers that do not perform routine immunofluorescence or immunohistochemistry on routine surveillance biopsies, immunostaining should be guided by histopathologic findings or clinical and serological data. On the basis of the available data and consensus of this writing group, specific intervals for surveillance were not recommended, and instead a general guideline that encompasses the time during which the risk of AMR is highest was provided.

After transplant, routine surveillance for antibody mediated rejection is recommended with attention to pathological and immunopathological findings in the endomyocardial biopsy; diagnosis is based on allograft biopsy pathology, and post-transplant circulating antibody monitoring is also recommended with particular attention to de-novo donor-specific antibodies, considering their association with poor patient survival.

Immunologic factors — patients with panel-reactive antibodies (PRA) of > 10% had longer median post-operative mechanical ventilation (9 days vs 1 day, respectively, p = 0.008) than those without antibodies, and most elevated PRA cases were women though gender was not incorporated in multivariate analyses. A high incidence of early graft dysfunction has been described in recipients with low titers of donor-specific HLA antibodies detected by flow cytometry, and pathology has occasionally documented antibody-mediated or hyperacute/accelerated rejection. No difference in PGD was noted among 36 recipients receiving an ABO blood type-compatible graft compared with 64 ABO-identical grafts.

Congenital heart disease — pre-transplant anatomic, hemodynamic, and sensitization considerations highlight that aortopulmonary collaterals can contribute to surgical bleeding and complicate the transplant procedure, and evaluation of flow and/or coil embolization of large collaterals before transplant may be useful; prior surgeries can cause thrombosis of central veins that may limit procedural and surveillance access, warranting careful venous and arterial access assessment; pulmonary hypertension and elevated resistance adversely affect morbidity and mortality, with reversibility of PVR in children more crucial than a specific baseline value; in previously operated children, elevated PRAs are associated with adverse outcomes though some can be transplanted across a positive crossmatch, and evaluation should include anti-HLA antibodies with identification of specific HLA antigens to facilitate a "virtual" crossmatch before transplant.

### Antibody-mediated rejection in cardiac transplantation: emerging knowledge in diagnosis and management: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^1176fa1k]. Circulation (2015). Medium credibility.

Pediatric heart transplantation — risk of anti–human leukocyte antigen (HLA) antibodies and sensitization involves congenital heart disease, mechanical support, and retransplantation; elevated panel reactive antibody (PRA) occurs in 12% to 19% of pediatric patients who underwent transplantation for end-stage congenital heart disease, and the transplant proportion is highest in infants (63%) and remains substantial in adolescents (24%). After implantation of cryopreserved allograft material, mean anti-HLA class I and class II antibody levels reached 92 ± 15% and 70 ± 26% within 3 months and persisted for at least 12 months. Elevated PRA is reported in 30% to 90% of children receiving long-term ventricular assist device support, whereas extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support does not appear to result in elevated PRA levels. In retransplantation, a multicenter analysis found no significant difference in mean PRA between primary and retransplantation (1.5 ± 4.9% versus 8.5 ± 27.1%, P = NS), but small single-center series reported a 40% incidence of elevated PRA; development of donor-specific antibodies (DSA) after transplantation is associated with antibody-mediated rejection (AMR), and anti-HLA class I complement-fixing and cytotoxic antibodies before and after transplantation negatively impact survival.

International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation consensus — need for standardized definition of pulmonary antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) is outlined: De novo donor-specific antibodies (DSA) and increased DSA titers have been associated with lung allograft dysfunction, occasionally in asymptomatic patients. There is no agreed-upon definition for pulmonary AMR in the literature and AMR is well recognized in kidney and heart allografts but ill-defined in lung transplantation. Individual centers have defined AMR uniquely; therefore a standardized definition is required to facilitate interpretation of literature, diagnose specific cases, develop treatment options, and inform research on risk factors, incidence, prevalence, clinical course and prognosis. The primary aim was to reach a consensus on a formal working definition of pulmonary AMR, with secondary goals to propose phenotypes and identify knowledge gaps to direct clinical evaluation and future research.

### Summary of the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation consensus conference on emerging understanding of antibodies and antibody-mediated rejection in heart transplantation [^115gakMW]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2025). High credibility.

Antibodies and antibody-mediated rejection in heart transplantation — desensitization strategies and outcomes in sensitized candidates include conventional options targeting antibodies by removal or inactivation and B-cell/ plasma cell–directed agents, with emerging therapies under investigation. Approaches using perioperative plasmapheresis and IVIG have demonstrated acceptable post-transplant outcomes; in one study, plasmapheresis/IVIG/rituximab reduced mean PRA by more than 50% with similar 5-year survival to nonsensitized candidates. In another study of sensitized candidates (n = 25) treated with plasmapheresis/IVIG/bortezomib, 76% underwent transplantation and median cPRA decreased for class I (90%-74%, p = 0.004) but not class II (74.5%-75.5%, p = 0.3). A carfilzomib-based approach reduced HLA antibodies and complement-binding in some but not all patients, with favorable outcomes at 3 years among those transplanted, and physicians should be aware that treatment responses vary across a wide range of HLA antibody titers and sensitizing events. Additionally, the HeartMate II device has been reported to be associated with a lower risk of developing HLA sensitization than the HeartMate I device.

Humoral sensitization screening and crossmatch guidance — Cytometry is much more sensitive than cytotoxic methods for determining panel-reactive antibody (PRA), and results from flow cytometry allow for better assessment regarding the risk of a positive crossmatch at the time of transplant. A PRA of > 10% is considered positive and a donor-specific prospective crossmatch is generally advised before transplant; if PRA is > 10%, or if a ventricular assist device has been inserted, then PRA determination should be repeated every 1 to 2 months. If a blood transfusion is required, PRA testing should be repeated 2 weeks after transfusion and each month thereafter for 6 months. Desensitization strategies have been advocated in patients who are highly sensitized.

Antibodies and antibody-mediated rejection in heart transplantation — post-transplant DSA evaluation and broader testing guidance state that several variables should be considered to treat patients with post-transplant DSA, including cardiac dysfunction by imaging, abnormal hemodynamics, an increasing MFI trend in DSA, the presence of early DSA, antibody attributes, biopsy-proven pAMR ≥ 2, and abnormal molecular findings as available. Endomyocardial biopsy is not mandated in patients with asymptomatic post-transplant DSA, but should be performed when DSA are associated with signs of clinical or subclinical graft dysfunction, or graft injury. The clinical utility of treating asymptomatic post-transplant DSA remains unclear. Testing and treatment of non-HLA antibodies have not been recommended until a causal role in graft injury and defined thresholds are established. Sensitization should be factored into donor heart allocation policy, and standardization of HLA laboratory assays and reporting is needed.

Non-HLA antibodies in heart transplantation — associations and evaluation — Non-HLA antibodies, specifically antibodies against MICA, endothelial cells, and angiotensin receptor antibodies, have also been associated with alloreactivity, cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV), and antibody-mediated rejection (AMR). Anti-MICA antibodies have been found in severe rejection after heart transplantation and donor-specific anti-MICA antibodies were suggested to be strongly associated with AMR and CAV. Although the assays are not readily available at all centers, consideration should be given to evaluation for these antibodies in graft dysfunction, particularly when there is no evidence of HLA antibodies. For angiotensin 1 (AT1) receptor antibodies, losartan blocked the effects in a small kidney transplant series, but this has not yet been demonstrated in heart transplant recipients and removal or blocking of AT1 receptor antibodies has not yet been demonstrated to have a clinical impact.

HIV-positive donor screening and eligibility — Use of organs from donors who test positive for HIV is absolutely contraindicated for non–HIV-positive recipients, and organs from patients with a positive screening test for HIV antibodies are not suitable for transplantation unless subsequent confirmation testing indicates that the original test results were falsely positive. False-negative testing can also result from hemodilution after the donor has received a large volume of transfused blood products; to minimize the risk of false-negative HIV antibody test results caused by hemodilution, any blood sample obtained for HIV antibody testing is required to be assessed for hemodilution in accordance with OPTN policy to determine if it is a qualified specimen. Even among seronegative donors, there have been rare instances of HIV transmission; if multiple tests related to HIV are performed, the results of all tests must be communicated directly to all institutions receiving organs from the donor. In November 2013, the HIV Organ Policy Equity Act was signed into law in the United States, supporting research efforts to determine the potential benefits of transplanting organs from HIV-positive donors into HIV-positive recipients, but this practice is not currently in effect.

Immunological assessment — Communicate all sensitizing events (eg, blood product transfusion, including platelets, pregnancy or miscarriage) or clinical events that can impact panel reactive antibody (PRA) to the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) laboratory (Not Graded), and perform HLA antibody testing at transplant evaluation, at regular intervals prior to transplantation and after a sensitizing event or a clinical event that can impact PRA (Not Graded). We recommend that HLA antibody testing be performed using solid phase assays (1B), and we recommend HLA typing of candidates at evaluation using molecular methods, optimally at all loci (1D). We suggest not routinely testing candidates for non-HLA antibodies (2C) and we suggest not routinely testing candidates for complement-binding HLA antibodies (2C). We suggest informing candidates about their access to transplantation based on blood type and histocompatibility testing results (2C). We recommend offering candidates with immunologically-reduced access to transplant access to a larger deceased donor pool, kidney exchange programs, and/or desensitization (1C), and we suggest that antibody avoidance (ie, kidney exchange, acceptable mismatch program) may be considered before desensitization (2C).

Donor selection breakout group — participants reported that the VXM is being performed in most centers and discussed essential considerations for conducting and interpreting VXM HLA testing, including the availability of full donor HLA, the date of the sample, and recent sensitization events, while agreeing that the VXM might not be applicable to every patient. In patients with complicated interpretations of HLA antibodies (especially those with multiple lower-level DSAs), a physical prospective crossmatch is warranted; however, CDC crossmatch cannot be mandated as this testing is not readily available in all HLA laboratories. Participants suggested that a surrogate crossmatch could be done in some cases and felt surrogate flow crossmatch is as useful as a surrogate CDC crossmatch to determine whether to avoid an antibody (corresponding antigen), and when crossing DSA they outlined considerations including patient characteristics (urgency, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support, bleeding, etc.) as well as MFI threshold level to avoid antibodies.

ISHLT pre-conference survey — pre-transplant antibody detection practices: For patients with detected antibodies but not highly sensitized, 86% did a virtual crossmatch; 30% did a prospective flow cytometry; 32% did a prospective CDC crossmatch; 1% responded other; and 4% did none. The most frequently cited antigen-avoidance threshold was an MFI cut-off of 5,000 (range > 0 to 10,000). Antibody monitoring pre-transplant occurred every 3 months for 34% of respondents; every 6 months for 19%; monthly for 15%; never if PRA was 0% at listing for 5%; with the remaining 27% varying frequency by waitlist or clinical factors. Approaches to avoiding Class I vs Class II anti-HLA antibodies did not differ for 70% of respondents. Regulatory submission of unacceptable antibodies occurred in 56% and 44% did not. Ordering of a prospective crossmatch varied: 22% for PRA ≥ 25%; 19% never if the virtual crossmatch was negative; 8% for PRA > 80%; 5% for PRA > 70%; 5% for PRA > 50%; and 41% used other or always/any-sensitized criteria. Organ acceptance decisions reflected crossmatch results: 48% would decline if flow cytometry crossmatch was positive and 75% would decline if CDC crossmatch was positive.

Antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) evaluation at the time of suspected rejection was explicitly recommended and includes testing for donor-specific anti-HLA antibodies, with consideration of non-HLA antibodies, and broader screening for AMR. It was strongly recommended that at the time of suspected AMR, blood be drawn at biopsy and tested for the presence of donor-specific anti-HLA class I and class II antibodies; in the absence of detectable anti-HLA antibodies, the assessment of non-HLA antibodies may be indicated. In contrast to the 2004 revision, screening for AMR was recommended, and recommendations were made regarding the routine timing for specific staining of endomyocardial biopsy specimens and the frequency by which circulating antibodies should be assessed.

DSA that remain at higher dilutions, C1q+ DSA antibodies, DSA that persist, and DSA arising late after transplantation have been associated with adverse outcomes. The clinical significance of antibodies against non-HLA antigens such as MICA are equivocal and require further validation. First-line therapies for desensitizing patients include IVIg, plasmapheresis, immunoadsorption, and rituximab.

### ISHLT consensus statement on the perioperative use of ECLS in lung transplantation: part I: preoperative considerations [^111kVoNS]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2025). High credibility.

ISHLT perioperative ECLS preoperative sensitization management — Desensitization protocols may include immunoglobulins, plasma exchange, rituximab and bortezomib, and while efficacious in renal transplantation, benefit in lung transplant remains limited to single center studies. The requirement for multiple blood transfusions whilst on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) may exacerbate sensitization with generation of additional HLA antibodies. If a desensitization protocol is not locally available, transfer to another center may be considered; if not possible, a high calculated panel reactive antibody (cPRA) may become a significant barrier to matching with an organ, rendering transplant unfeasible and ECMO bridge‑to‑transplant (BTT) unlikely to succeed. As practical thresholds, antibodies with an MFI of less than 1000 may be considered unlikely to be harmful and are infrequently treated, whereas antibodies with an MFI of greater than 5000 are considered a high immunological risk even with desensitization therapy. The document recommends that in centers where desensitization therapy is unavailable, high panel reactivity (e.g. PRA > 95%) should be considered for likely impact when approaching ECLS as a bridge to transplantation, requiring clinical expertise and knowledge of local organ availability (CoR: IIa LoE: C2). Single center data suggest similar mid‑to‑long‑term outcomes to unsensitized patients, but no randomized control trial data exist regarding optimal approach or timing.

Non-HLA antibody — potential contributors to antibody-mediated injury are described without requiring detectable anti-HLA antibodies: "Non-HLA and nontraditional antibodies may cause immune-mediated injury in the absence of detectable anti-HLA antibody". Targets include "autoantigens, polymorphic minor antigens, and polymorphic non-HLA antigens such as major histocompatibility complex class I chain–related antigens". Mechanistically, "These antibodies bind endothelium and result in apoptosis but not in complement-mediated lysis". Clinically, "Perhaps the most well described non-HLA antibodies are anti-endothelial cell antibodies, which have been implicated in acute humoral rejection, CAV, and poor graft survival".

14.1 Prevention of Organ Rejection after Kidney Transplantation

A 24-month, multi-national, open-label, randomized (1:1:1) trial was conducted comparing two concentration-controlled everolimus regimens of 1.5 mg per day starting dose (targeting 3 to 8 ng/mL using an LC/MS/MS assay method) and 3 mg per day starting dose (targeting 6 to 12 ng/mL using an LC/MS/MS assay method) with reduced exposure cyclosporine and corticosteroids, to 1.44 g per day of mycophenolic acid with standard exposure cyclosporine and corticosteroids. The mean cyclosporine starting dose was 5.2, 5 and 5.7 mg/kg body weight/day in the everolimus 1.5 mg, 3 mg and in mycophenolic acid groups, respectively. The cyclosporine dose in the everolimus group was then adjusted to the blood trough concentration ranges indicated in Table 5, whereas in the mycophenolic acid group the target ranges were 200 to 300 ng/mL starting Day 5: 200 to 300 ng/mL, and 100 to 250 ng/mL from Month 2 to Month 12.

All patients received basiliximab induction therapy. The study population consisted of 18 to 70 year old male and female low-to-moderate risk renal transplant recipients undergoing their first transplant. Low to moderate immunologic risk was defined in the study as an ABO blood type compatible first organ or tissue transplant recipient with anti-human leukocyte antigen (HLA) Class I panel reactive antibody (PRA) less than 20% by a complement dependent cytotoxicity-based assay, or less than 50% by a flow cytometry or ELISA-based assay, and with a negative T-cell cross match. Eight hundred thirty-three (833) patients were randomized after transplantation; 277 randomized to the everolimus 1.5 mg per day group, 279 to the everolimus 3 mg per day group and 277 to the mycophenolic acid 1.44 g per day group. The study was conducted at 79 renal transplant centers across Europe, South Africa, North and South America, and Asia-Pacific. There were no major baseline differences between treatment groups with regard to recipient or donor disease characteristics. The majority of transplant recipients in all groups (70% to 76%) had three or more HLA mismatches; mean percentage of panel reactive antibodies ranged from 1% to 2%. The rate of premature treatment discontinuation at 12 months was 30% and 22% in the everolimus 1.5 mg and control groups, respectively, (p = 0.03, Fisher's exact test) and was more prominent between groups among female patients. Results at 12 months indicated that everolimus 1.5 mg per day is comparable to control with respect to efficacy failure, defined as treated biopsy-proven acute rejection, graft loss, death, or loss to follow-up. The percentage of patients experiencing this endpoint and each individual variable in the everolimus and control groups is shown in Table 7.

Topic 6: Management of late acute rejection — late rejection refers to episodes after the first post-transplant year, with risk factors including younger recipient age, prior history of acute rejection episodes or episodes occurring > 6 months after transplantation, African American ethnicity, presence of HLA donor-specific antibodies, donor and recipient sex mismatch, calcineurin-inhibitor (CNI) reduced or free immunosuppression, and medication non-adherence. Adolescent solid organ transplant recipients 14–27 years are at particular risk for nonadherence and increased rates of late acute rejection. Observational studies identify antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) as an important cause of late rejection, accelerated CAV, and graft failure; therefore, patients with signs or symptoms of graft dysfunction late after heart transplantation (HT) should undergo evaluation for AMR with endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) and immunostaining before steroid treatment and should be tested for circulating HLA donor-specific antibodies. In addition, CAV remains a frequent cause of late graft dysfunction and should be excluded by angiography and intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) or optical coherence tomography (OCT), which may detect vessel wall changes prior to angiographic presentation.

Discussion — consensus definitions are dynamic and will allow further modifications as new insights emerge, and limitations of the classification system include that criteria are based on limited data in the literature; all centers may not be able to evaluate all criteria; HLA assays, techniques and language are not standardized between laboratories; accuracy of histopathologic classification may be limited due to sampling error, lack of unique histopathologic features, between-observer variability in grading, and coexistence of other causes of allograft dysfunction including graft preservation injury, acute cellular rejection, infection and other factors; and severity has not been clearly defined, with agreement that severity may be confounded by concurrent diagnoses.

### The management of antibodies in heart transplantation: an ISHLT consensus document [^112qfzJW]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2018). Medium credibility.

Antibody assays and complement-binding detection in heart transplantation — single antigen bead (SAB) testing yields a calculated PRA (cPRA) and provides cryptic antigen and complement-binding insights: SAB assays yield a calculated PRA (cPRA) — a percentage of actual incompatible donors based on specificity and ethnicity, not on the number of reactions, and a cPRA of 75% means that 75% of donors in the population will express HLA antigen to which the recipient has relevant quantities of pre-formed antibodies. Antibodies to cryptic antigens were found in 21% of patients on the transplantation waiting list, and a retrospective analysis of 975 renal transplant recipients showed lower graft survival in patients with complement-fixing antibodies to cryptic antigens. For complement-binding assessment, C1q SAB is the most sensitive, specific, and clinically relevant assay for AMR in the first month after heart transplantation, and it can be used to monitor desensitization using IVIg therapies pre- or post-transplantation because C1q, not IgG, is detected. Additional modified SAB assays detect C3d- and C4d-binding anti-HLA antibodies; the C4d assay has clinical relevance for long-term outcomes in heart transplantation, and the presence of C3d-binding antibodies at AMR diagnosis correlated with increased risk of graft loss in kidney transplant recipients. To mitigate the prozone effect, the use of ethylene-diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) in blood sample tubes reduces the prozone effect and dilution such as 1:8 will dilute excess complement and expose antibodies, resulting in detection.

	Prevention of Organ Rejection After Kidney Transplantation

A 24-month, multi-national, open-label, randomized (1:1:1) trial was conducted comparing two concentration-controlled Zortress regimens of 1.5 mg per day starting dose (targeting 3 to 8 ng/mL using an LC/MS/MS assay method and 3 mg per day starting dose (targeting 6 to 12 ng/mL using an LC/MS/MS assay method) with reduced exposure cyclosporine and corticosteroids, to 1.44 g per day of mycophenolic acid with standard exposure cyclosporine and corticosteroids. The mean cyclosporine starting dose was 5.2, 5 and 5.7 mg/kg body weight/day in the Zortress 1.5 mg, 3 mg and in mycophenolic acid groups, respectively. The cyclosporine dose in the Zortress group was then adjusted to the blood trough concentration ranges indicated in Table 5, whereas in the mycophenolic acid group the target ranges were 200 to 300 ng/mL starting Day 5: 200 to 300 ng/mL, and 100 to 250 ng/mL from Month 2 to Month 12.

Posttransplantation antibodies — associations with complement deposition and outcomes are quantified as follows: In a study linking complement deposition, HLA (human leukocyte antigen) serology, and graft function, "DSAs were found in 95% of biopsy samples that were positive for both C4d and C3d, compared with 35% in biopsy samples that were positive for C4d only". Moreover, "C4d+C3d+ biopsy samples demonstrated strong correlation with graft function and mortality; allograft dysfunction was present in 84% of patients with C4d+C3d+ compared with 5% of C4d+C3d− (P < 0.0001)".

Donor specific antibodies (DSA) after heart transplantation — De novo DSA development is "not uncommon, occurring in up to 25% of recipients at 10 years post-transplantation". The majority "are directed against Class II or a combination of Class I and II HLA antigens and have been associated with poor post-transplant survival", and "particularly Class II antibodies, persistent antibodies on serial testing, and antibodies appearing more than 1 year after HT have also been shown to predict subsequent antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) and graft loss". A "consensus conference was organized in 2016 by ISHLT" and "Solid-phase assays, such as the Luminex SAB assay, were recommended to detect circulating antibodies". Post-transplant DSA monitoring "should be minimally performed at 1-, 3-, 6-, and 12 months post-transplant", and "Thereafter, patients should be monitored annually", with "Consideration should be given to evaluation for non-HLA antibodies" including "MHC class I chain-related polypeptide A (MICA), endothelial cells, and angiotensin receptor (AT-1R) antibodies".

5.8	Vaccine Administration

Immunizations should not be administered in patients who have received RETHYMIC until immune-function criteria have been met.

Inactivated vaccines:

Inactivated vaccines may be administered once all of the following criteria are met:

Immunosuppressive therapies have been discontinued.
Immunoglobulin (IgG) replacement therapy has been discontinued.
The total CD4+T cell count is > 200 cells/mm3and there are more CD4+T cells than CD8+T cells (CD4+ > CD8+).

It is recommended that no more than 2 inactivated vaccines be given per month.

Live Vaccines:

Live virus vaccines should not be administered until patients have met the criteria for inactivated vaccines and received vaccinations with inactivated agents (e.g., tetanus toxoid). No additional vaccines (live or inactivated), except the inactivated influenza vaccine, should be given within 6 months after vaccination with a measles-containing vaccine or within 2 months after the varicella vaccine. Consider verifying response to vaccination with appropriate testing, in particular varicella and measles.

5.9	Anti-HLA Antibodies

All patients should be screened for anti-HLA antibodies prior to receiving RETHYMIC. Patients testing positive for anti-HLA antibodies should receive RETHYMIC from a donor who does not express those HLA alleles.

5.10	HLA Typing

HLA matching is required in patients who have received a prior hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) or a solid organ transplant. Patients who have received a prior HCT are at increased risk of developing GVHD after RETHYMIC if the HCT donor did not fully match the recipient. To minimize this risk, HLA matching of RETHYMIC to recipient alleles that were not expressed in the HCT donor is recommended.

The sensitized patient — To fully characterize the candidate, HLA antibodies should be screened by solid-phase assays with specificities determined by single antigen beads. These patients should have frequent updates (monthly to every 3 months) while on the waitlist and after sensitizing events such as transfusion of blood products and pregnancy. Waitlist desensitization protocols have generally involved intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) and plasmapheresis with occasional addition of bortezomib and rituximab.

### Summary of the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation consensus conference on emerging understanding of antibodies and antibody-mediated rejection in heart transplantation [^1141RodU]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2025). High credibility.

Pediatric heart transplant immunologic considerations — multiple factors distinguish pediatrics from adult patients, including that HLA antibodies may be high in the first 12 to 18 months after birth as they can be passively acquired maternally via the placenta, and in pediatric patients with Fontan surgery protein-losing enteropathy can result in protein loss and HLA antibodies may be falsely low. For highly sensitized pediatric patients, commonly used therapeutics in adults are utilized with favorable outcomes with moderately intensified immunosuppression, but utilization of plasmapheresis/immunoadsorption remains limited due to low blood volume, vascular access limitations, side effects, and patient compliance. Angiotensin II type 1 receptor antibody (AT1R-Ab) is a non-HLA antibody associated with poor clinical outcomes in adult kidney transplant recipients, and there is now limited evidence to suggest that AT1R-Ab may be a significant part of the immunologic milieu impacting pediatric organ transplant outcomes and that differences in this phenomenon may exist between pediatric and adult patients.

Donor-specific antibodies (DSA) after heart transplantation — monitoring and clinical relevance are outlined as follows: Solid-phase assays enable quantification of anti-HLA antibodies at low levels and tracking of DSA strength over time, and the presence of DSA is associated with poor graft survival, rejection, and CAV. The ISHLT has recommended routine monitoring of DSA as a marker of the alloimmune environment; DSA is not part of the diagnosis of antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) but may serve as a supporting feature. DSA could be monitored after major decreases in immunosuppression to determine whether weaning has resulted in increased alloimmune activation.

HLA antibody detection — single‑antigen bead (SAB) assay workflow is detailed. Recipient serum potentially containing anti‑HLA antibodies is added to a mixture of synthetic beads; each bead is coated with a set of antigens (screening beads) or with a single antigen (single‑antigen beads). A unique dye signature (up to 100) specifies the identity of each bead, anti‑HLA antibodies bind their specific bead, a detection antibody captures a reporter dye, and each bead is interrogated using a dual beam laser, allowing a prediction of the crossmatch result.

### Reproductive health after thoracic transplantation: an ISHLT expert consensus statement [^115MRYTZ]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2023). High credibility.

ISHLT expert consensus — Recommended baseline assessment of clinical status and graft function for lung and heart transplant recipients desiring pregnancy includes history, examination, laboratory evaluation, anti-HLA antibodies, immunosuppressive drug levels, cytomegalovirus (CMV) testing, and graft function testing, with impacts on management and outcomes. History notes that "Genetic conditions may trigger the need for genetic counseling… special considerations for patients with pre-transplant diagnosis of PPCM", and for lung transplant "Patients with CF require special attention to nutrition status". Clinical examination highlights that "Arterial hypertension is associated with higher risk of preeclampsia". Laboratory assessment indicates "Pre-pregnancy DM, renal dysfunction and proteinuria are associated with higher risk of preeclampsia" and that "DM requires close monitoring to lessen risk for macrosomia and shoulder dystocia" (diabetes mellitus [DM]). Anti‑HLA antibodies matter because "Pregnancy could trigger alloimmunization" and "Sensitized patients have a worse long-term outcome". For maintenance therapy, "Trough levels of immunosuppression should be stable before pregnancy, to minimize the risk of rejection" and "Close monitoring of immunosuppression levels is recommended". Infection screening emphasizes "Primary CMV infection and, to a lesser extent, CMV reactivation are associated with the risk of fetal CMV disease" and "CMV seronegative patients should be advised to take additional precautions". Standard graft testing uses "Lung transplant: pre- and post-bronchodilator spirometry" and "Heart transplant: echocardiogram", with impact that "Graft dysfunction is associated with high risk of complications during pregnancy and a worse long-term outcome" and "Lung transplant: spirometry to establish stability, capacity to carry a pregnancy to term, and to provide a baseline to allow monitoring for potential pregnancy-related deterioration". When clinically indicated, in‑depth testing includes "Lung transplant: bronchoscopy/biopsy" and "Heart transplant: RHC/biopsy, coronary angiogram", and impacts include "Rejection may recur during pregnancy or after delivery and portends increased risk", "Lung transplant: microbiological surveillance with bronchoscopy in those unable to provide sputum specimens, especially if there is concern for recurrent infection with organisms; decline in spirometry should prompt bronchoscopy to evaluate for infection or rejection", and "Heart transplant: CAV portends increased risk" (cardiac allograft vasculopathy [CAV]).

Treatment thresholds and therapy notes — conference participant views indicate that not all DSA need to be treated, and most participants would not treat DSA unless there was also evidence of graft dysfunction; asymptomatic DSA would lead to more frequent monitoring of both antibodies and graft function. There was consensus that C1q + antibodies, graft dysfunction, and restrictive physiology suggested a need for antibody treatment, and chronic Class II HLA antibodies were seen as the most difficult to eradicate. In heart transplantation, bortezomib is the latest addition to the mainstream armamentarium and has led to modest improvements in reducing the PRA of the most highly sensitized patients. The conference participants were uncertain about non-HLA antibodies, felt comfortable treating only in the context of graft dysfunction, agreed that too few data exist and further research is needed, and noted consensus that antibodies probably cause, or at least worsen, CAV.

Desensitization goals and crossmatch strategies in highly sensitized candidates — In highly sensitized patients awaiting heart transplantation, a combined approach may be necessary: desensitization therapy and virtual crossmatch. The conventional goal of desensitization therapy is to achieve a negative crossmatch before proceeding with a transplant; however, an alternative strategy is that transplantation proceeds despite a positive crossmatch and therapies are initiated to mitigate the impact of donor-specific antibodies (DSA). Cornell et al reported good outcomes for 30 renal transplant recipients transplanted with a positive crossmatch and treated with eculizumab, and in that study there was a significant reduction in early antibody-mediated rejection compared with an historic control group.

Virtual crossmatch (VXM) interpretation and mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) thresholds are described as follows: the assay output using mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) units is only semiquantitative, and the VXM has a negative predictive value of 92% and a positive predictive value of 79%. There is currently no agreed-upon standard on which specific antibodies should be avoided vs crossed, but for a single antibody, flow cytometry and complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) crossmatch will be negative at an MFI of less than 2,000 and potentially positive at an MFI greater than 4,000. Centers may list antibodies as unacceptable at thresholds ≥ 2,000, whereas less conservative centers may use > 7,000; in this scenario, lower-level DSA (MFI < 7,000) might be crossed, and crossing lower-level DSA does not appear to compromise outcomes for heart transplant recipients. In addition, the biological significance of the antibody (e.g., complement-fixing capacity) should be considered.

### Antibody-mediated rejection in cardiac transplantation: emerging knowledge in diagnosis and management: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^113XHt1k]. Circulation (2015). Medium credibility.

Clinical AMR in pediatric heart transplant recipients — in a large series (n = 1217), 15% of patients (< 18 years of age) presented with severe acute ventricular dysfunction within 5 years of transplantation, and 30% of these had no or only mild evidence of cellular rejection (ISHLT grade 0 or 1R). Survival was only 50% at 2 years, and 26% of the deaths were attributed to graft vasculopathy, graft failure, or lethal arrhythmias. Pathological evaluation for AMR was not systemically performed in the study group; however, a positive crossmatch or the pretransplantation detection of circulating anti-HLA antibodies was not associated with these events. Although less common than in adult recipients, graft vasculopathy is an important cause of late graft failure in pediatric heart transplant recipients, with an incidence of 3% per year.

Seventy-five percent selected an antibody threshold of 5,000 MFI or less to designate avoids [84 responses]. Regarding pretransplant desensitization, 33% will desensitize for calculated panel-reactive antibodies (cPRA) between 50% and 80%, and 33% will desensitize for cPRA greater than 80% [82 responses], with common therapies including plasmapheresis/immunoadsorption (87%), intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) (79%), rituximab (74%), and bortezomib (45%) [77 responses]. For post-transplant donor-specific antibody (DSA) monitoring, over 74% would monitor at months 1, 3, 6, and 12 in the first year [82 responses], while after the first year, antibodies are routinely checked annually in 44% of centers [86 responses]; common post-transplant DSA treatments included plasmapheresis/immunoadsorption (86%), IVIG (84%), rituximab (69%), and augmented corticosteroids (58%) [86 responses].

### Utilization of hepatitis C virus-infected organ donors in cardiothoracic transplantation: an ISHLT expert consensus statement [^114f5JES]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2020). High credibility.

Donor and recipient selection — recommendations specific to hepatitis B virus (HBV) when using hepatitis C virus (HCV) NAT+ donors — All transplant candidates should be tested for HBV at time of transplant evaluation, and non-immune individuals should be vaccinated before transplant whenever possible. Recipients with evidence of chronic active HBV infection (HBV surface antigen + or HBV NAT+) have a higher risk of reactivation while on DAA therapy; consideration of avoiding HCV NAT+ organs should be made, and they should be placed on HBV antiviral suppression. Donors that die from drug overdose have increased rates of HBV infection along with HCV, and one study noted that 20% of HCV NAT+ donors were also positive for HBV core Ab but with negative HBV viremia. When HCV NAT+ donors who are HBV core Ab positive but HBV NAT− are used, serial monitoring for HBV in the recipient using HBV quantitative viral load and surface antigen should be performed every 3 months for the first post-transplant year. If the recipient is not immune to HBV infection (immunity is determined by HBV surface antibody ≥ 10 mIU/ml), antiviral prophylaxis with lamivudine, entecavir, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), or tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) may be considered; if the recipient is immune to HBV, no prophylaxis is needed in the case of the donor being HBV core Ab+ and HCV NAT+. If HBV viremia is detected in the recipient, appropriate antiviral therapy should be initiated as per guideline. There are no data on donors simultaneously viremic with both HBV and HCV, and we do not recommend accepting such organ offers outside of a clinical trial. Recipients with cleared HBV infection (HBV core Ab+ but surface antigen and NAT−) have a low risk of reactivation but should be monitored with HBV quantitative viral load testing every 3 months for the first year; in an HCV NAT+ to HBV core Ab+ setting, antiviral prophylaxis with lamivudine, entecavir, TDF, or TAF for the duration of DAA therapy can be considered with surveillance.

### Antibody-mediated rejection in cardiac transplantation: emerging knowledge in diagnosis and management: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^117DpR2e]. Circulation (2015). Medium credibility.

Non-HLA antibodies in cardiac transplant antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) — anti-endothelial and anti-cytoskeletal responses are associated with allograft injury and can precede AMR episodes. Production of anti-endothelial cell antibodies appears to be stimulated by cytomegalovirus infection, increasing 1 to 4 weeks after detection of cytomegalovirus DNA. Anti-vimentin antibodies have been detected alone or with anti-HLA antibodies and appear linked to HLA-DQ2, and both anti-myosin and anti-vimentin antibodies are significantly elevated in AMR, preceding episodes by 3 to 4 months. One- and 2-year anti-vimentin titers predict cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV). Anti–major histocompatibility complex class I chain–related A (MICA) antibodies after transplantation precede acute rejection and are more prevalent in those with rejection. Because assays for non-HLA antibodies are not widely available, non-HLA antibodies should be suspected in patients who have no evidence of donor-specific antibody (DSA) by solid phase assay but have pathological or clinical evidence of AMR.

The treatment failure rate within 12 months post-transplantation was statistically significantly lower in the THYMOGLOBULIN group than in the Active Comparator group (25% vs 38%; p = 0.02), based on the composite endpoint (biopsy-proven acute rejection [BPAR], graft loss [GL], or death, with "lost to follow-up" considered as a treatment failure). The individual elements of the composite endpoint were BPAR (13% vs 21%), GL (8% vs 10%), and death (4% vs 4%) for the THYMOGLOBULIN and Active Comparator groups, respectively (Table 7).

The composite endpoint is defined as the occurrence of any of the following: BPAR (Grade I–III), graft loss, death, or lost to follow-up. Except for patients counted as "lost to follow-up", a patient can be counted in more than one category for the individual components (BPAR, graft loss, death).

In Study 1, patients received either THYMOGLOBULIN (n = 141) 1.5 mg/kg daily for a total of 5 doses (Day 0 to Day 4) or Active Comparator (n = 137) 2 doses of 20 mg each (Day 0, Day 4). For both treatment groups, the first induction treatment was initiated prior to the reperfusion of the kidney. All patients received triple maintenance immunosuppression (cyclosporine, mycophenolate mofetil, and corticosteroids) throughout the 12 months of the study.

Recipient disease characteristics were balanced between the 2 treatment groups with similar distribution of prior transplant, degree of sensitization and number of mismatched human leukocyte antigens (HLA). Overall, the mean percentage of pretransplant panel-reactive antibody (PRA) was 6% and the historical peak was 14%. The number of patients having a higher level of sensitization with PRA > 20% was similar in the THYMOGLOBULIN (9%) and Active Comparator (10%) groups. The mean number of mismatched HLAs was evenly distributed across the 2 treatment groups.

AASLD/AST adult liver transplantation — acute antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) clinical features and context: Acute AMR may cause unexplained graft dysfunction, thrombocytopenia, hypocomplementemia and vasculitis on liver biopsy with diffuse C4d staining, can occur in ABO incompatible grafts but is rare in ABO compatible liver transplant recipients because of the regenerative capacity of the liver, large sinusoidal network, and secretion of soluble class I human leukocyte antigen that bind donor-specific antibodies, and variable hepatic microvasculature class II expression provides fewer class II donor-specific antibody targets.

### Antibody-mediated rejection in cardiac transplantation: emerging knowledge in diagnosis and management: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^1117SDwZ]. Circulation (2015). Medium credibility.

Antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) timing and spectrum after heart transplantation include hyperacute, early, and late presentations and can coincide with cellular rejection. AMR may present as hyperacute rejection within 0 to 7 days after transplantation in patients who are sensitized to donor HLA antigens, and early AMR may occur during the first month after transplantation because of the development of de novo donor-specific antibody (DSA) or preexisting DSA, with a higher prevalence of allograft dysfunction and hemodynamic compromise. Approximately 50% of heart transplant recipients who develop rejection > 7 years after transplantation have evidence of AMR, and AMR has been reported concurrent with cellular rejection in up to 24% of cases; there is increasing evidence that AMR is a spectrum ranging from subclinical histological, immunologic, and/or serological findings without graft dysfunction to overt AMR with hemodynamic compromise.

### Antibody-mediated rejection of the lung: a consensus report of the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation [^115tuB9E]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2016). Medium credibility.

International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation consensus — antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) in lung transplantation is recognized as a cause of allograft dysfunction in lung transplant recipients. Because there are no standardized diagnostic criteria or an agreed-upon definition, a working group was created to determine criteria for pulmonary AMR and establish a definition, and diagnostic criteria and a working consensus definition were established. Key diagnostic criteria include the presence of antibodies directed toward donor human leukocyte antigens or characteristic lung histology with or without evidence of complement 4d within the graft; exclusion of other causes of allograft dysfunction increases confidence in the diagnosis but is not essential. Pulmonary AMR may be clinical or sub-clinical. Donor-specific anti–human leukocyte antigen antibodies are known to contribute to AMR in solid-organ transplantation, and the presence of DSA at the time of transplant or detected de novo post-transplant is well described in renal transplantation.

### Revision of the 1996 working formulation for the standardization of nomenclature in the diagnosis of lung rejection [^113axx31]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2007). Medium credibility.

Acute antibody-mediated (humoral) rejection — scope and features in lung transplantation — remains controversial, with acute humoral rejection recognized in heart and renal transplants but with no consensus on its recognition and diagnosis or on its significance and treatment; in the lung, the diagnosis and recognition of antibody-mediated rejection is more controversial and less well developed than for other solid-organ grafts. The presence of serum anti-HLA antibodies and the deposition of complement in alveolar tissue after transplantation suggest a role for humoral immune responses in lung transplantation, and pulmonary transplant recipients with evidence of sensitization, as demonstrated by elevated titers of panel-reactive antibodies, have significantly more ventilator days post-operatively compared with non-sensitized patients. Historically, acute antibody-mediated rejection of the lung has been associated with hyperacute rejection clinically manifested by primary graft failure occurring very early after transplantation in the setting of pre-formed antibodies to donor HLA antigens or endothelial cells, with morphology associated with fibrin thrombi in alveolar septa, fibrinoid necrosis of alveolar septal walls and hemorrhage. In 2006, no histologic features for antibody-mediated rejection in the lung were agreed upon, and although pulmonary capillaritis has been described as possibly related to acute lung rejection, it is not recognized in transbronchial biopsies; humoral immune responses are also implicated in the pathogenesis of obliterative bronchiolitis, possibly due to anti-HLA antibodies contributing to the development of scarring fibrosis via stimulation of epithelial cells within the airway.

Study 2

THYMOGLOBULIN was evaluated in an open-label, parallel-arm, randomized, active-controlled, investigator-sponsored study in kidney transplant patients (n = 230) at higher immunological risk of rejection.

The noninferiority of THYMOGLOBULIN to Active Comparator was achieved with treatment failure rates of 25% versus 34%, with an estimated treatment group difference (THYMOGLOBULIN – Active Comparator) of -9% (95% CI: -19.9% to 3.6%), based on the composite endpoint (BPAR, GL, or death, with lost to follow-up considered as a treatment failure) in the 12 months after transplantation. The individual elements of the composite endpoint were BPAR (11% vs 21%), GL (15% vs 11%), and death (4% vs 3%) for the THYMOGLOBULIN and Active Comparator groups, respectively (Table 8).

In Study 2, patients received either THYMOGLOBULIN (n = 114) 1.25 mg/kg daily for a total of 8 doses (Day 0 to Day 7) or Active Comparator (n = 116) 1 mg/kg (maximum dose 100 mg) on Days 0, 14, 28, 42, and 56. For both treatment groups, the first induction treatment was initiated prior to the beginning of the surgical procedure. All patients received triple maintenance immunosuppression (tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and corticosteroids) throughout the 12 months of the study.

Recipient disease characteristics were balanced between the 2 treatment groups, including similar distribution of prior transplant, degree of sensitization and number of HLA mismatches. The number of patients having prior transplants was 163 of 230 (71%). Overall, the mean percentage of pretransplant PRA was 35% and the historical peak was 72%. The number of patients having a higher level of sensitization with PRA > 20% was similar in the THYMOGLOBULIN (55%) and Active Comparator (58%) groups. The mean number of HLA mismatches was evenly distributed across the 2 treatment groups.

### ISHLT consensus statement for the selection and management of pediatric and congenital heart disease patients on ventricular assist devices endorsed by the American Heart Association [^112Laas1]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2021). High credibility.

Heart transplantation (HT) listing and sensitization with ventricular assist device (VAD) support — The development of anti-HLA antibody after VAD has been reported in adult and pediatric patients; while patients on VAD support have a transient increase in anti-HLA antibodies, it remains unclear how VAD-related sensitization impacts waiting list and transplant outcomes, yet despite higher sensitization in VAD patients, the post-transplant outcomes for pediatric VAD patients are equivalent to non-VAD patients. An evolving area of practice is the timing of listing for HT after VAD placement: the classical approach is to activate a patient on the transplant list simultaneously with VAD placement to reduce exposure to potential VAD complications that could alter transplant candidacy, whereas lower adverse event rates seen with CF-VADs have led some centers to optimize post-VAD recovery prior to activation on the HT waiting list and may be associated with better HT outcomes. Consideration may be given to delaying listing for transplant to allow for rehabilitation, especially after implantation of a durable CF LVAD; it is imperative to maximize physical, nutritional, and psychological healing and CR during the recovery interval, which also provides time for reverse cardiac remodeling that may allow VAD explantation in selective cases. At present, there is insufficient data for which wait list strategy optimizes patient outcomes, and pediatric patients with intracorporeal CF VADs are being supported for longer periods of time with 20% being supported greater than a year.

### Antibody-mediated rejection in cardiac transplantation: emerging knowledge in diagnosis and management: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^111btdY4]. Circulation (2015). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis recommendations — antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) in cardiac transplantation should be based on immunopathologic features with clinical descriptors, and histological evidence of AMR, if concomitantly present, should be considered diagnostic (Class I; Level of Evidence C). Immunofluorescent staining for C4d and C3d or immunoperoxidase staining for C4d and CD68 (or C3d) should be performed to evaluate for AMR (Class I; Level of Evidence B). Determination of non-HLA antibodies, such as antiendothelial, anti-vimentin, anti-MICA and antiMICB antibodies, may be considered when anti-HLA antibodies are absent and AMR is suspected (Class IIb; Level of Evidence C).

### Antibody-mediated rejection in cardiac transplantation: emerging knowledge in diagnosis and management: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^117Debhe]. Circulation (2015). Medium credibility.

Pathogenesis and histopathologic features of antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) in cardiac allografts center on endothelial-directed antibodies, complement activation, and microvascular injury. AMR develops when recipient antibody is directed against donor HLA antigens on the endothelial layer of the allograft, inducing fixation and activation of the complement cascade and activation of the innate and adaptive immune responses, with complement and immunoglobulin deposited within the allograft microvasculature causing endothelial cell activation, upregulation of cytokines, infiltration of macrophages, increased vascular permeability, and microvascular thrombosis, ultimately manifesting as allograft dysfunction. The vascular endothelium is the point of first contact for anti-donor antibody and the primary locus of activity in AMR; enlarged or swollen endothelial cells are consistently seen, vasculitis or leukocytes may infiltrate through the endothelium demonstrating active humoral immunity with antibody-dependent cytotoxicity, cytokine- and chemoattractant-mediated homing, and circulating monocyte recruitment, and intravascular thrombi can be present particularly in severe manifestations.

### Antibody-mediated rejection in cardiac transplantation: emerging knowledge in diagnosis and management: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^114L4E48]. Circulation (2015). Medium credibility.

Intravenous gamma globulin (IVIg) for AMR — mechanisms, use patterns, and limited evidence are summarized as follows. IVIg has been demonstrated to successfully reduce antibodies in sensitized transplant candidates and contains anti-idiotypic antibodies that inhibit HLA-specific alloantibodies in vitro and in vivo. It is commonly used for highly sensitized patients awaiting cardiac transplantation but has never been systematically studied after transplantation to prophylactically reduce the incidence of AMR; when used for AMR or desensitization, it is frequently combined with other immune therapies. Very few data support IVIg for acute AMR; in one small series of 7 kidney and 3 heart recipients with AMR, IVIg plus cyclophosphamide or tacrolimus reversed rejection in all patients within 2 to 5 days of infusion, though recurrence was high.

### CRISPR-edited HLA donor kidney transplant to reduce rejection risk… [^111PrzFo]. ClinicalTrials (2025). Medium credibility.

Study Overview In organ transplantation, differences in HLA genes between donor and recipient are a primary driver of allorecognition and graft rejection. Mismatched donor HLA antigens are identified as "non-self" by the recipient's immune system, provoking CD8 <sup> + <sup> cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses, CD4 <sup> + <sup> T-helper responses, and natural killer cell activation that can damage the graft. whereas all control pigs receiving unmodified organs rejected within 3 months. Treated animals showed reduced donor-specific antibody production and T-cell reactivity, demonstrating that lowering graft antigenicity can ameliorate rejection. These findings provide a strong rationale that knocking out donor HLA genes can reduce human allograft immunogenicity and potentially allow better graft survival with less immunosuppression.
- Negative crossmatch: No pre-existing anti-donor reactivity that would cause immediate graft failure.
- High immunologic risk patients are eligible: Patients with high panel reactive antibody levels or a history of sensitization are allowed and even anticipated in this trial, as the intervention is designed to benefit patients with broad HLA sensitization. For instance, patients with calculated PRA > 80% can be included.
- Active infection: Any ongoing severe infection that would contraindicate transplantation or be exacerbated by immunosuppression. Patients with controlled HIV may be considered on a case-by-case basis, but active uncontrolled infection is excluded.
- Severe co-morbidities that would significantly increase transplant risk or confound results: for example, uncontrolled cardiovascular disease, uncontrolled diabetes with end-organ damage beyond ESRD, severe liver dysfunction, or other life-threatening illnesses unrelated to kidney failure. Such conditions could make the surgery unsafe or the outcome hard to interpret.
