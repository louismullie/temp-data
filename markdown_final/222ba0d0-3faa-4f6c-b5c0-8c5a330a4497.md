## Question

Is nadolol indicated for the treatment of toxic epidermal necrolysis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether nadolol is indicated for the treatment of toxic epidermal necrolysis and what the evidence shows for or against its use. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about nadolol's labeled and recognized off-label indications on the FDA label and in drug compendia. Then, I should verify current SJS or TEN management standards from guidelines and high-quality reviews. Next, I will examine the immunopathophysiology of TEN to assess mechanistic plausibility for beta blockade. After that, I should search for any clinical studies or case reports suggesting benefit or harm of nadolol in TEN. Finally, I need to weigh risks versus benefits in critically ill TEN patients and synthesize a recommendation aligned with the evidence base.

> Let me first confirm the drug's scope. Nadolol's FDA labeling lists hypertension and angina pectoris as approved indications, with common off-label uses including migraine prophylaxis, atrial fibrillation rate control, and symptomatic thyrotoxicosis, and I see no indication or mention of Stevens-Johnson syndrome or TEN anywhere on the SPL or associated FDA materials, which is already a strong signal against a role in TEN therapy [^113ee1iV] [^112hBSAh] [^115Xim1j] [^112fdUnD].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions before reviewing the disease management standards. Current evidence syntheses and reviews emphasize prompt withdrawal of the culprit drug, burn or ICU-level supportive care, meticulous wound and fluid management, and consideration of systemic immunomodulators such as corticosteroids, IVIG, cyclosporine, or TNF-alpha blockade in selected patients, whereas thalidomide has been shown to increase mortality and is contraindicated, and importantly beta blockers are not included in any algorithm for TEN treatment in these sources [^114zR6cL] [^113p6EgY] [^112FHi7V] [^113d9aJP].

> Wait, let me verify mechanistic plausibility. TEN is driven by drug-specific cytotoxic T cells and NK cells that induce keratinocyte death via Fas and FasL interactions, perforin and granzyme B, granulysin, and inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha, and emerging translational work highlights HMGB1 release and necroptosis pathways that can be attenuated in models by TNF-alpha blockade with etanercept, which aligns with some clinical signals for targeted immunomodulation, and I do not see a biologically credible pathway whereby nonselective beta blockade with nadolol would favorably modulate these cytotoxic cascades or epidermal necrolysis [^116TWZH2] [^114Y6cgi] [^115h3WKt].

> I should double-check safety considerations in the context of critically ill TEN patients. Nadolol can cause or worsen bradycardia, hypotension, atrioventricular block, bronchospasm, peripheral vasoconstriction including Raynaud phenotype, and may exacerbate heart failure, and TEN patients often require aggressive resuscitation and have labile hemodynamics and high infection risk, so adding a nonselective beta blocker without a clear therapeutic indication could plausibly worsen perfusion, respiratory status, and cardiovascular stability in this setting [^112H9g46] [^112J1waA] [^112hBSAh] [^117CDAc7].

> Let me consider whether any clinical reports suggest a role for nadolol in TEN, because an isolated case series might exist. I need to check for mentions across the systematic reviews, guidelines, and drug treatment summaries for SJS or TEN, and there are none that include nadolol or any beta blocker as therapy, while separate literature on nadolol relates to infantile hemangioma and includes safety concerns that are not relevant to TEN treatment, which further supports the absence of an evidence-based role for nadolol in TEN [^113p6EgY] [^114zR6cL] [^111JUgGo] [^112XFyjy].

> Hmm, wait a minute, what if beta blockade had some indirect benefit via catecholamine modulation in critical illness. I should verify whether any comparative effectiveness analyses of systemic therapies for TEN show benefit with agents outside immunomodulators, and large overviews and meta-analyses consistently fail to show mortality benefit beyond supportive care for most agents, with signals for corticosteroid plus IVIG combinations and promising but still limited data for cyclosporine or etanercept, and again no beta blocker signal appears, which argues against an indirect benefit hypothesis for nadolol in TEN [^117VpnJL] [^113p6EgY] [^113d9aJP].

> I will now examine the risk benefit calculus one more time before concluding. The absence of any guideline endorsement or clinical evidence for nadolol in TEN, the lack of mechanistic plausibility for beta blockade to interrupt keratinocyte apoptosis or necroptosis pathways, and the meaningful risk of bradycardia, hypotension, and bronchospasm in a population with high acuity collectively argue that nadolol should not be used as a treatment for TEN, and instead care should focus on immediate culprit drug withdrawal, burn unit level supportive care, and judicious consideration of evidence informed immunomodulatory strategies where appropriate [^114zR6cL] [^116TWZH2] [^112H9g46] [^117VpnJL].

> Conclusion and recommendation. I need to ensure the bottom line is explicit. Nadolol has no role in the treatment of toxic epidermal necrolysis and should be avoided as a TEN therapy, and management should adhere to established supportive protocols with consideration of targeted immunomodulation rather than empiric beta blockade, which carries foreseeable harm without demonstrated benefit in this disease process [^113ee1iV] [^114zR6cL] [^113p6EgY] [^112FHi7V].

---

No, nadolol is **not indicated** for toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), and there is **no evidence of benefit**. TEN management centers on **supportive care** [^114zR6cL] and immunomodulatory therapies such as corticosteroids, IVIG [^117VpnJL], cyclosporine, or etanercept [^113p6EgY]. Nadolol, a non-selective beta-blocker used for cardiovascular indications [^113ee1iV], is not recommended for TEN. Its use may cause bradycardia, hypotension, or bronchospasm [^112hBSAh], which can complicate the management of TEN. There are **no clinical trials or guidelines** supporting nadolol for TEN, and it should not be used for this indication [^113d9aJP].

---

## Pharmacological properties of nadolol

Nadolol is a non-selective beta-adrenergic antagonist that blocks beta-1 and beta-2 receptors, thereby reducing heart rate, myocardial contractility, and blood pressure [^113ee1iV]. It is primarily used to treat cardiovascular conditions such as hypertension, angina pectoris, and arrhythmias. Nadolol is **not indicated for dermatological conditions**, including TEN.

---

## Pathophysiology of toxic epidermal necrolysis

TEN is a **severe immune-mediated reaction** characterized by widespread keratinocyte apoptosis and epidermal detachment [^116TWZH2]. The pathogenesis involves cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural killer cells releasing mediators such as Fas ligand, perforin, granzyme, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and granulysin. These mediators induce extensive epidermal necrosis, leading to widespread skin and mucosal damage.

---

## Current standard treatments for TEN

The management of TEN primarily involves **supportive care** [^114zR6cL], including:

- **Immediate discontinuation** of the causative drug [^116C4c9a].
- **Supportive care** in specialized burn or intensive care units [^115zNdGq].
- **Fluid and electrolyte management** [^116C4c9a].
- **Wound care** and infection prevention [^115zNdGq].
- **Pain management** [^116C4c9a].

Pharmacological interventions commonly used include:

- **Systemic corticosteroids**: To reduce inflammation and immune response [^113p6EgY].
- **Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG)**: To neutralize circulating antibodies and immune complexes [^117VpnJL].
- **Cyclosporine**: An immunosuppressant that inhibits T-cell activation [^113p6EgY].
- **Etanercept**: A TNF-alpha inhibitor that reduces inflammation and keratinocyte apoptosis.

These treatments aim to halt disease progression, **reduce mortality**, and promote re-epithelialization [^113d9aJP].

---

## Evidence regarding nadolol in TEN

A comprehensive review of the literature reveals **no evidence supporting the use of nadolol** in the treatment of TEN [^113p6EgY]. Nadolol's pharmacological profile does not align with TEN's immune-mediated mechanisms and lacks immunomodulatory or anti-inflammatory properties relevant to management [^113ee1iV]. Furthermore, no clinical trials, case reports, or guidelines recommend nadolol for TEN [^114zR6cL]. The absence of evidence and lack of mechanistic rationale indicate that nadolol is **not an appropriate treatment** for TEN.

---

## Potential risks and adverse effects of nadolol in TEN patients

Nadolol administration in TEN patients may pose significant risks, including:

- **Bradycardia and hypotension**: Nadolol can cause significant cardiovascular depression, which may complicate the management of critically ill TEN patients [^112H9g46].
- **Bronchospasm**: As a non-selective beta-blocker, nadolol can induce bronchospasm, particularly in patients with underlying respiratory conditions [^112hBSAh].
- **Masking of hypoglycemia**: Nadolol can mask symptoms of hypoglycemia, complicating metabolic management in critically ill patients.
- **Exacerbation of psoriasis**: Nadolol may exacerbate psoriasis, a dermatological condition, raising concerns about its use in patients with severe skin reactions [^112hBSAh].

Given these risks, nadolol is **not recommended** for TEN.

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Current clinical guidelines and expert recommendations **do not support the use of nadolol** in TEN management [^114zR6cL]. The recommended pharmacological interventions include systemic corticosteroids, IVIG, cyclosporine, and etanercept [^113p6EgY]. Nadolol is not mentioned in guidelines or expert consensus statements on TEN [^113d9aJP].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

In summary, there is **no evidence supporting the use of nadolol** for the treatment of toxic epidermal necrolysis [^113p6EgY]. Nadolol's pharmacological properties do not align with TEN pathophysiology, and its use may pose significant risks to patients. Current clinical guidelines and expert recommendations do not endorse its use in TEN [^114zR6cL]. Therefore, **nadolol should not be used** for TEN. Clinicians should adhere to established treatment protocols, including supportive care and immunomodulatory therapies such as systemic corticosteroids, IVIG, cyclosporine, and etanercept [^117VpnJL].

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of nadolol PO (also known as Corgard):

- **Exacerbation of angina**: Use caution in vasospastic angina, as β-blockers without alpha1-blocking activity can cause unopposed coronary vasoconstriction, worsening symptoms.

- **Exacerbation of bronchospasm**: Use extreme caution in patients with bronchospastic diseases. Nadolol may impair bronchodilation by blocking beta2 receptors, and its use is generally discouraged.

- **Exacerbation of heart failure**: Use caution in patients with compensated heart failure (HF). Monitor closely for signs of decompensation and discontinue gradually if HF develops.

- **Exacerbation of muscle weakness and double vision**: Use caution in patients with myasthenia gravis.

- **Exacerbation of psoriasis**: Use caution in patients with psoriasis.

- **Exacerbation of Raynaud's phenomenon and peripheral vascular disease**: Use caution in patients with peripheral circulatory disorders, including Raynaud's disease or syndrome and peripheral occlusive vascular disease.

- **Hypertension**: Use extreme caution in patients with untreated pheochromocytoma. Ensure adequate α-blockade is achieved before initiating nadolol to prevent a paradoxical increase in blood pressure (BP).

- **Major surgery**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as β-blockers should not routinely be withdrawn before major surgery. However, their effect on the adrenergic response may increase anesthesia and surgical risks.

- **Mask symptoms of hyperthyroidism**: Use caution in patients with hyperthyroidism. Avoid abrupt withdrawal of β-blocker therapy to prevent symptom exacerbation or the precipitation of a thyroid storm.

### Update on Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis: Diagnosis and management [^114zR6cL]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2024). High credibility.

Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) are the most severe cutaneous adverse reactions, typically drug-induced in adults. Both SJS and TEN have high morbidity and mortality rates. SJS/TEN poses clinical challenges for physicians managing patients suffering from this condition, as it is both rare and a rapidly progressing systemic disease with severe cutaneous, mucosal, and systemic manifestations. Although many cases of SJS/TEN have been reported in the literature, there is no consensus regarding diagnostic criteria or treatment. Significant progress has been made in understanding its genetic predisposition and pathogenesis. This review is intended to provide physicians with a comprehensive but practical SJS/TEN roadmap to guide diagnosis and management. We review data on pathogenesis, reported precipitating factors, presentation, diagnosis, and management of SJS/TEN, focusing on developments in the last five years.

### Systemic interventions for treatment of Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), and SJS/TEN overlap syndrome [^113p6EgY]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Low credibility.

Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), and SJS/TEN overlap syndrome are rare, severe cutaneous adverse reactions usually triggered by medications. In addition to tertiary-level supportive care, various systemic therapies have been used, including glucocorticoids, intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIGs), cyclosporin, N-acetylcysteine, thalidomide, infliximab, etanercept, and plasmapheresis. There is an unmet need to understand the efficacy of these interventions.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of systemic therapies (medicines delivered orally, intramuscularly, or intravenously) for the treatment of SJS, TEN, and SJS/TEN overlap syndrome.

- **Search methods**: We searched the following databases up to March 2021: the Cochrane Skin Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase. We also searched five clinical trial registers, the reference lists of all included studies and of key review articles, and a number of drug manufacturer websites. We searched for errata or retractions of included studies.

- **Selection criteria**: We included only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and prospective observational comparative studies of participants of any age with a clinical diagnosis of SJS, TEN, or SJS/TEN overlap syndrome. We included all systemic therapies studied at the time of writing and permitted comparisons between each therapy, as well as between therapy and placebo.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We used standard methodological procedures as specified by Cochrane. Our primary outcomes were SJS/TEN-specific mortality and adverse effects leading to discontinuation.

### Toxic epidermal necrolysis with severe hyperbilirubinemia: Complete re-epithelialization after bilirubin reduction therapies [^1153ss2z]. The Journal of Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Toxic epidermal necrolysis is a life-threatening skin disorder with an estimated mortality rate of approximately 20–30%. It is characterized by erosion of more than 30% of the skin surface; however, skin lesions are usually re-epithelialized within 2–3 weeks. Previously, we reported a fatal case of toxic epidermal necrolysis with hyperbilirubinemia, where more than 60% of body surface areas had been eroded for 9 weeks. We hypothesized that hyperbilirubinemia was the cause of the delayed re-epithelialization, as bilirubin damaged cultured keratinocytes in vitro.

In this case, we treated another instance of toxic epidermal necrolysis with severe hyperbilirubinemia. To reduce serum bilirubin levels, we performed bilirubin adsorption therapies, resulting in successful re-epithelialization of skin lesions within 4 weeks. Although further studies are required, we consider bilirubin adsorption therapies to be a promising treatment for toxic epidermal necrolysis with hyperbilirubinemia, particularly in cases of delayed re-epithelialization.

### Death associated with nadolol for infantile hemangioma: A case for improving safety [^112XFyjy]. Pediatrics (2020). Low credibility.

Nadolol is a β-adrenergic antagonist that has been shown to be efficacious in the treatment of infantile hemangioma. It has been suggested that this drug may have fewer side effects compared with the gold standard therapy, propranolol, because it does not exhibit membrane-stabilizing effects and has little ability to cross the blood-brain barrier. However, the pharmacokinetics and safety of nadolol in infants are not well understood, potentially making this therapy dangerous. β-adrenergic antagonist toxicity causes bradycardia, hypotension, hypoglycemia, and even death.

We report a case of a 10-week-old girl who was started on nadolol for infantile hemangioma, died 7 weeks later, and was found to have an elevated postmortem cardiac blood nadolol level of 0.94 mg/L. The infant had no bowel movements for 10 days before her death, which we hypothesize contributed to nadolol toxicity. Pharmacokinetics studies show a large fraction of oral nadolol either remains in the feces unchanged or is excreted into feces via the biliary system, allowing continued absorption over time in infants who stool infrequently.

Propranolol may be a safer therapy overall. Not only does it have a shorter half-life, but propranolol is hepatically metabolized and renally eliminated, allowing for less drug accumulation in healthy infants with variable stooling patterns. We suggest that if nadolol is selected for therapy, pediatricians should instruct parents to monitor their infants' bowel movements closely and encourage early intervention in the event of decreased stooling. This intervention may greatly enhance the safety of nadolol therapy.

### Exploring recent advances in drugs severe cutaneous adverse reactions immunopathology [^115gP4Hn]. Allergy (2025). High credibility.

Recent advances in the immunopathology of drugs causing severe cutaneous adverse reactions have been explored extensively. The literature review indicates significant progress in understanding the mechanisms underlying these reactions. There is growing evidence that specific immune pathways play a critical role in the manifestation of these adverse effects.

Research highlights include identification of genetic factors that predispose individuals to severe reactions, leading to a better understanding of patient susceptibility. Insights into these pathways have paved the way for the development of targeted therapeutic strategies, potentially reducing the occurrence of such reactions.

Additionally, advancements in diagnostic techniques have improved early detection, facilitating timely intervention. This has a consequential impact on patient outcomes, particularly in managing severe cases.

Future research directions include exploring novel biomarkers for early prediction and developing personalized medicine approaches to mitigate risk. As understanding deepens, these research efforts promise to enhance patient safety and treatment efficacy.

### A well-demarcated hyperpigmented plaque of the posterior neck [^115uQtaB]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Low credibility.

- **Question 3**: What are the most appropriate next steps in management of this patient?
	- A. Discontinue medications initiated in the hospital and observe for improvement
	- B. Treat the lesion with topical corticosteroids
	- C. Admit the patient to a burn unit and prevent dehydration with intravenous fluids
	- D. Reassurance and regular wound care
	- E. Conduct patch testing to verify the implicated allergen

- **Answers**:
	- A. Discontinue medications initiated in the hospital and observe for improvement – Incorrect. This would be appropriate management for an FDE or exanthematous drug reaction, but no medication discontinuation is required for pressure necrosis.
	- B. Treat the lesion with topical corticosteroids – Incorrect. LSC, EM, and ACD might benefit from topical corticosteroids, but pressure necrosis is not an inflammatory condition and therefore treatment with topical corticosteroids is not recommended.
	- C. Admit the patient to a burn unit and prevent dehydration with intravenous fluids – Incorrect. If the patient had findings concerning for Stevens Johnson Syndrome-toxic epidermal necrolysis, this would be appropriate. The singularity and stability of the skin lesion, its morphology, and the patient's drug history are not concerning for Stevens Johnson Syndrome-toxic epidermal necrolysis.
	- D. Reassurance and regular wound care – Correct. Pressure-induced skin necrosis is a benign condition which is not related to any underlying infectious process or drug exposure. There is no known risk of progression to toxic epidermal necrolysis or other severe adverse cutaneous reaction. Most lesions will improve with reassurance and regular wound care.

### TNF-α induced extracellular release of keratinocyte high-mobility group box 1 in Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis: Biomarker and putative mechanism of pathogenesis [^115h3WKt]. The Journal of Dermatology (2023). High credibility.

Decreased epidermal high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) expression is an early marker of epidermal injury in Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis (SJS/TEN). Etanercept, an anti-tumor necrosis factor therapeutic, is effective in the treatment of SJS/TEN. The objective was to characterize antitumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α)-mediated HMGB1 keratinocyte/epidermal release and etanercept modulation. HMGB1 release from TNF-α treated (± etanercept), or doxycycline-inducible RIPK3 or Bak-expressing human keratinocyte cells (HaCaTs) was determined by western blot/ELISA.

Healthy skin explants were treated with TNF-α or serum (1:10 dilution) from immune checkpoint inhibitor-tolerant, lichenoid dermatitis, or SJS/TEN patients ± etanercept. Histological and immunohistochemical analysis of HMGB1 was undertaken. TNF-α induced HMGB1 release in vitro via both necroptosis and apoptosis. Exposure of skin explants to TNF-α or SJS/TEN serum resulted in significant epidermal toxicity/detachment with substantial HMGB1 release, which was attenuated by etanercept. Whole-slide image analysis of biopsies demonstrated significantly lower epidermal HMGB1 in pre-blistered SJS/TEN versus control (P < 0.05).

Keratinocyte HMGB1 release, predominantly caused by necroptosis, can be attenuated by etanercept. Although TNF-α is a key mediator of epidermal HMGB1 release, other cytokines/cytotoxic proteins also contribute. Skin explant models represent a potential model of SJS/TEN that could be utilized for further mechanistic studies and targeted therapy screening.

### Nadolol and bendroflumethiazide [^112J1waA]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2016). Low credibility.

Most adverse effects have been mild and transient, rarely requiring withdrawal of therapy.

- **Cardiovascular**: Bradycardia, with heart rates of less than 60 beats per minute, occurs commonly. Heart rates below 40 beats per minute and/or symptomatic bradycardia were observed in about 2 of 100 patients. Symptoms of peripheral vascular insufficiency, usually of the Raynaud type, have occurred in approximately 2 of 100 patients. Cardiac failure, hypotension, and rhythm/conduction disturbances have each occurred in about 1 of 100 patients. Single instances of first-degree and third-degree heart block have been reported. Intensification of AV block is a known effect of beta-blockers.

- **Central nervous system**: Dizziness or fatigue has been reported in approximately 2 of 100 patients. Paresthesias, sedation, and changes in behavior have each been reported in approximately 6 of 1000 patients.

- **Respiratory**: Bronchospasm has been reported in approximately 1 of 1000 patients.

- **Gastrointestinal**: Nausea, diarrhea, abdominal discomfort, constipation, vomiting, indigestion, anorexia, bloating, and flatulence have been reported in 1 to 5 of 1000 patients.

- **Miscellaneous**: Each of the following has been reported in 1 to 5 of 1000 patients: rash, pruritus, headache, dry mouth, eyes, or skin, impotence or decreased libido, facial swelling, weight gain, slurred speech, cough, nasal stuffiness, sweating, tinnitus, and blurred vision. Reversible alopecia has been reported infrequently.

### Interventions for toxic epidermal necrolysis [^112FHi7V]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

Toxic epidermal necrolysis is a rare condition where a drug reaction induces skin loss, similar to that seen in extensive burns. It is associated with high morbidity and mortality, and there is no clear agreement on effective treatment.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of all interventions for the treatment of toxic epidermal necrolysis.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register (March 2001), the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (March 2001), MEDLINE (1966 to December 2001), EMBASE (1980 to December 2001), DARE (4th Quarter 2001), and CINAHL (1982 to October 2001).

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials of therapeutic and supportive interventions that included participants clinically diagnosed with toxic epidermal necrolysis were included.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two independent reviewers carried out study selection and assessment of methodological quality.

- **Main results**: Only one randomised controlled trial of treatment was identified. This trial compared the effectiveness of thalidomide with placebo and included 22 patients, 12 in the treatment group and 10 in the placebo group. Patients on the treatment arm received thalidomide 200 mg twice daily for 5 days. The main endpoint was the measurement of the progression of skin detachment after 7 days. Other endpoints were the overall mortality and severity of the disease, evaluated with the simplified acute physiology score. The study was terminated as the mortality on the treatment arm was 83% compared to 30% on the control arm (relative risk 2.78, 95% confidence interval).

### TNF-α induced extracellular release of keratinocyte high-mobility group box 1 in Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis: Biomarker and putative mechanism of pathogenesis [^114DRR6m]. The Journal of Dermatology (2023). Low credibility.

Epidermal HMGB1 expression in explants treated with SJS/TEN patient serum was significantly decreased (Figure 3) in both replicates, with levels being visibly higher when the explants were co-incubated with etanercept. Conversely, apparent immune cell HMGB1 immunostaining in SJS/TEN serum-treated explants was increased in the presence of etanercept. Explants treated with sera from either ICI-tolerant or ICI-induced lichenoid dermatitis patients showed no substantial loss of epidermal HMGB1 and no modulation of effect by etanercept. Cleaved caspase 3 expression was notionally elevated in SJS/TEN serum-treated explants at the epidermal basal layer (Supporting Information Figure S2) compared to tolerant serum-treated explants, but this was not substantially modulated by etanercept. RIPK3 expression was significant in all explants in the basal layer and was visibly lower in TNF-α and SJS/TEN serum-treated explants compared to control, healthy, or lichenoid dermatitis serum treatment (Supporting Information Figures S1 and S2).

In addition to in situ skin HMGB1 expression, we also examined extracellular HMGB1 in the explant culture media (Supporting Information Figure S3). This was found to be significantly higher in explants treated with SJS/TEN patient serum (16.91 ng/mL ± 3.51) compared to the media-only control (1.03 ng/mL ± 0.14, P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in those co-administered etanercept (19.00 ng/mL ± 2.62; P < 0.05). Explants treated with sera from either the tolerant or lichenoid dermatitis patient (4.36 ng/mL ± 1.83 and 1.82 ng/mL ± 0.2).

### The psychological impact of Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis on patients' lives: A critically appraised topic [^111UNx9H]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2020). Low credibility.

At the first stage of screening, 33 full-text articles were assessed for eligibility, and 27 full-text studies were excluded for various reasons. Six studies were ultimately included in the Critically Appraised Topic. Among these, two were qualitative and four were quantitative. Two of the studies originated from the U.K., two from France, one from Canada, and one from South Africa.

Following analysis, two overarching themes were identified: the impact of diagnosis both now and for the future, and living with the psychosocial impact. For each theme, two additional subthemes were developed. Quotations from the qualitative papers are presented below.

### Amlodipine-induced toxic epidermal necrolysis [^113FEbbC]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2011). Low credibility.

The objective of this study is to report a case of amlodipine-induced dermatotoxicity following treatment for diabetic nephropathy. Although other members of the dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers have been reported to cause dermatotoxic reactions, this is the first report attributing this effect to amlodipine. A 71-year-old diabetic and hypertensive woman had been noted to have worsened renal dysfunction and hyperkalemia attributed to enalapril; thus, a trial of amlodipine was begun.

On day 12 of amlodipine therapy, the patient developed a pruritic maculopapular rash on her hands for which she sought medical attention. On day 16, she presented again to the emergency department, now with hives and small blisters involving the trunk and arms with approximately 25% TBSA involvement, warranting transfer to a regional burn treatment center. The rash progressed after admission to 48.5% TBSA and included conjunctival sloughing. The patient's hospital course was uneventful, and she was discharged after 8 days.

Drug-induced dermatotoxicity presenting as toxic epidermal necrolysis is often caused by antibiotics and antiepileptic medications; however, calcium channel blockers are an uncommon cause. The Naranjo assessment yielded a score of 5, and the SCORTEN was 4 with a predicted mortality of 58%. This report represents the first published case of amlodipine-induced toxic epidermal necrolysis.

### Infantile toxic epidermal necrolysis: Successful treatment of an 8-week-old with intravenous immunoglobulin and amniotic membrane transplant [^113SEW5A]. Pediatric Dermatology (2021). High credibility.

Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis comprise a spectrum of severe mucocutaneous hypersensitivity reactions. A paucity of data limits understanding of the etiology, treatment options, and prognosis of this entity in the infantile population compared to that in the adult and pediatric literature. We describe the case of an 8-week-old male with toxic epidermal necrolysis treated successfully with intravenous immunoglobulin and amniotic membrane transplant. This patient is the youngest surviving infant with toxic epidermal necrolysis to be reported.

### TNF-α induced extracellular release of keratinocyte high-mobility group box 1 in Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis: Biomarker and putative mechanism of pathogenesis [^116wadjf]. The Journal of Dermatology (2023). High credibility.

We have shown that the exposure of healthy skin explants to both TNF-α and serum from an SJS/TEN patient was able to evoke a skin phenotype akin to SJS/TEN in both morphology and HMGB1 expression. We have also shown that etanercept was able to attenuate toxicity and, at least for TNF-α, reverse HMGB1 cellular release in the epidermis. The lack of effect of etanercept in SJS/TEN serum-treated explants is likely due to the multitude of other molecules present that exert cytotoxic effects independently of TNF-α, consistent with the multifaceted and complex pathogenesis of SJS/TEN.

- **Physiologically-relevant skin explant model**: This model has the potential to be used for assessing the pathogenic role and mechanism of other immune-derived cytotoxic mediators implicated in SJS/TEN, such as granulysin, perforin, granzyme B, and LL37. Furthermore, by inducing an SJS/TEN-like event in healthy skin explants with TNF-α and inhibiting it with etanercept, we have a valid model system with the potential to screen targeted therapies for potential therapy in SJS/TEN.

The results presented here should be interpreted with some caution. Given the small sample size, it is not possible to determine interindividual variability in response, both between skin donors and between serum samples. This will be the focus of future work.

To conclude, we have demonstrated that keratinocyte-derived HMGB1 release is a useful biomarker for keratinocyte injury in early SJS/TEN. The skin explant model described may be a useful model to identify not only other proteins involved in this condition.

### Aquacel Ag in the treatment of toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) [^114vcpu2]. Burns (2008). Low credibility.

Toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) is a life-threatening dermatological disease characterized by extensive destruction of the epidermis and is associated with a 25–60% mortality rate in adults. We presented one patient with TEN, with 86% skin slough, successfully treated using AQUACEL Ag exclusively. All of the wounds healed completely eight days after the onset of TEN. AQUACEL Ag is an efficient and cost-effective adjunct in the treatment of TEN.

### Epitol [^116viutv]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Serious and sometimes fatal dermatologic reactions, including toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) and Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), have been reported with carbamazepine treatment. The risk of these events is estimated to be about 1 to 6 per 10,000 new users in countries with mainly Caucasian populations; however, the risk in some Asian countries is estimated to be about 10 times higher.

Carbamazepine should be discontinued at the first sign of a rash unless the rash is clearly not drug-related. If signs or symptoms suggest SJS/TEN, use of this drug should not be resumed, and alternative therapy should be considered.

### Treatment of toxic epidermal necrolysis in a pediatric patient with a nanocrystalline silver dressing [^1165wT1L]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

To report a case of toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) involving 90% body surface area, a successful treatment was conducted using a nanocrystalline silver dressing (Acticoat, Smith & Nephew, Largo, FL).

- **Methods**: A review was carried out on both hospital and acute wound center patient records, as well as recent English medical literature regarding TEN and nanocrystalline silver dressing.

- **Results**: We found only one report of TEN treated with a nanocrystalline silver dressing. The dressing was both effective in preventing wound infection and convenient for treating our patient with TEN.

- **Conclusion**: The use of nanocrystalline silver dressing should be considered for the treatment of TEN.

### Treating toxic epidermal necrolysis with systemic immunomodulating therapies: A systematic review and network meta-analysis [^117VpnJL]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2021). Low credibility.

Various systemic immunomodulating therapies have been used to treat toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), but their efficacy remains unclear.

- **Objective**: To perform a systematic review and network meta-analysis (NMA) evaluating the effects of systemic immunomodulating therapies on mortality for Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS)/TEN overlap and TEN.

- **Methods**: A literature search was performed in online databases (from inception to October 31, 2019). Outcomes were mortality rates and Score of Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (SCORTEN)-based standardized mortality ratio (SMR). A frequentist random-effects model was adopted.

- **Results**: Sixty-seven studies involving 2079 patients were included. An NMA of 10 treatments showed that none was superior to supportive care in reducing mortality rates and that thalidomide was associated with a significantly higher mortality rate (odds ratio, 11.67; 95% confidence interval, 1.42–95.96). For SMR, an NMA of 11 treatment arms showed that corticosteroids and intravenous immunoglobulin combination therapy was the only treatment with significant survival benefits (SMR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.31–0.93).

- **Limitations**: Heterogeneity and a paucity of eligible randomized controlled trials.

- **Conclusions**: Combination therapy with corticosteroids and IVIg may reduce mortality risks in patients with SJS/TEN overlap and TEN. Cyclosporine and etanercept are promising therapies, but more studies are required to provide clearer evidence.

### TNF-α induced extracellular release of keratinocyte high-mobility group box 1 in Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis: Biomarker and putative mechanism of pathogenesis [^115fZ9Ms]. The Journal of Dermatology (2023). High credibility.

RIPK3 expression in the basal layer was not significantly higher in TNF‐α‐treated explants compared to controls. However, there was a noticeable reduction in RIPK3 expression in explants (both control and TNF‐α‐treated) co‐administered with etanercept. No significant expression of cleaved caspase 3 was observed in any of the treatment groups.

- **Expression and supernatant release in healthy skin explants exposed to/patient serum**: Having established the effect of TNF‐α on epidermal toxicity and HMGB1 release, the ex vivo work was expanded to investigate the effect of exposing healthy skin to sera from healthy control, lichenoid dermatitis, and SJS/TEN patients (acute phase). TNF‐α concentrations of the three sera were determined by ELISA as healthy control 2.92 pg/mL (0.29 pg/mL final concentration), lichenoid dermatitis 9.17 pg/mL (0.92 pg/mL final concentration), and SJS/TEN 12.25 pg/mL (1.22 pg/mL final concentration).

As previously described, exposure of explants to ICI‐induced SJS/TEN patient serum induced grade III pathology with intra‐epidermal damage and necrosis in both duplicates. The addition of etanercept reduced the pathology to grade II in both instances. The addition of serum from a patient with ICI‐induced lichenoid dermatitis resulted in grade II pathology in both replicates, with etanercept co‐administration having little effect. Exposure to serum from an ICI‐tolerant patient resulted in no significant difference in pathology (grade I) compared to the media-only control.

### Toxic epidermal necrolysis caused by etonogestrel implantation: A rare presentation [^1114XEkh]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Low credibility.

The skin biopsy of the right upper thigh demonstrates notable separation of the epidermis from the dermis at the dermoepidermal junction, which contains lymphocytes, vacuolar changes, and occasional necrotic keratinocytes (original magnification: ×20).

After 5 days in the medical intensive care unit, the patient was transferred to our burn center for evaluation and management. We observed a full-body eruption of pink and red papules, erythematous plaques on the trunk and extremities, and scattered serous-filled vesicles over the face and back (Fig 3, A), upper extremities (Fig 3, B), lower extremities, and perineum. Several areas of epidermolysis with a clean, erythematous base were noted (Fig 3, C). Mucosal sloughing, hemorrhagic crusting, and desquamation of the lips were also present. The patient was treated supportively with pain control and intravenous IgG (90 g daily at 75 mL/h) for 3 days. The epidermolysis improved gradually with local wound care and whirlpool therapy. The patient began tolerating a regular diet and was discharged 6 days after admission to the burn center following an uncomplicated hospital course.

Clinical photographs of the patient after transfer to our burn center demonstrate diffuse rashes on the (A) back and (B) upper extremity, and (C) desquamation with exposed, erythematous dermis on the upper portion of the back and buttocks.

### Severe cutaneous adverse drug reactions: who should treat, where and how? Facts and controversies [^113XjVgC]. Clinics in Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) and Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) are uncommon but extremely serious and often life-threatening mucocutaneous reactions characterized by extensive epithelial sloughing and systemic symptoms. There is no effective evidence-based treatment for severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCAR) to drugs and no consensus on how to treat these patients. This contribution presents some of the controversies concerning the treatment of SCAR patients, including where and by whom, as well as the issue of the value of treatment with corticosteroids and intravenous immunoglobulin.

Investigators agree that more studies are needed and that there are insufficient data to draw definite conclusions. The spectrum of disagreement is wide and the debate is ongoing. At the end, the important question is should we wait with our decisions until all these controversies are settled, and we have more or full evidence? This question, as well as all others, is open for debate, evidently a "toxic" debate on toxic epidermal necrolysis.

### Photodistributed toxic epidermal necrolysis in association with lamotrigine and tanning bed exposure [^1127YyUa]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) are rare, life-threatening immune-mediated conditions characterized by mucocutaneous epidermal necrosis. In 80% to 95% of SJS/TEN cases, exposure to an offending drug can be identified approximately 6 to 14 days prior to presentation. The eruption typically begins as scattered, dusky, erythematous macules distributed on the head, neck, and trunk, progressing to the extremities in larger, confluent patches that can be detached with lateral pressure (Nikolsky sign). As necrosis spreads, flaccid bullae develop, leading to diffuse epidermal detachment. Painful erosions of the oral, ocular, and genital mucosa are present in 87% to 100% of TEN cases.

The pathogenesis of SJS/TEN is incompletely understood; however, a high density of CD8+ lymphocytes within the epidermis and blister fluid has been demonstrated. It is hypothesized that CD8+ T lymphocytes drive a complex inflammatory response, leading to extensive keratinocyte apoptosis.

Photodistributed SJS/TEN has been occasionally reported. Drugs such as sulfasalazine, antimalarials, ciprofloxacin, clobazam, itraconazole, and naproxen have been associated with photodistributed SJS/TEN. Currently, little is known about the effects of ultraviolet (UV) radiation on the metabolism of culprit drugs or drug-immune system interactions. We present a case of photodistributed TEN associated with lamotrigine and tanning bed use, discussing the possible pathogenesis of this distinct presentation.

### Noninferiority and safety of nadolol vs propranolol in infants with infantile hemangioma: A randomized clinical trial [^111JUgGo]. JAMA Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

We previously published a pilot study to examine the efficacy and safety of nadolol through comparison with a historical cohort treated with oral propranolol. At similar mean dosages (2.1 mg/kg/d), 10 patients receiving nadolol had a mean (SD) IH involution of 51% (18.5%) at the 4-week visit, 83% (13.9%) at the 12-week visit, and 97% (3.5%) at the end of the study (24 weeks). In contrast, 10 patients receiving propranolol had a mean (SD) IH involution of 28% (10.4%), 56% (16.6%), and 86% (14.8%) at 4, 12, and 24 weeks, respectively (P < 0.001). Nadolol was well tolerated with no significant adverse events.

The preliminary data supported our hypothesis that nadolol is an efficacious and, given its pharmacological properties, alternative modality to propranolol for use in the treatment of IHs. The objective of this study was to document the noninferiority and safety of oral nadolol compared with oral propranolol in the treatment of IHs.

### Toxic epidermal necrolysis induced by sulfonamide eyedrops [^115TNjQn]. Cornea (2008). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study is to describe a case of toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) triggered by sulfonamide eyedrops. A 9-year-old white boy with type I diabetes developed fever, constitutional symptoms, and a widespread blistering rash within hours of beginning a course of sulfonamide eyedrops for conjunctivitis. The patient was intubated and treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, as well as systemic and topical corticosteroids.

Results indicate that the patient survived and has bilateral acuities of 20/30 at 12 months of follow-up. Pathological examination of a skin biopsy sample confirmed the diagnosis of TEN.

Concluding, TEN is a rare but life-threatening side effect of topical sulfonamide eyedrops.

### Update on Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis: Diagnosis and management [^1178kc4X]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2024). Low credibility.

SJS/TEN has a reported incidence of 1–5 cases per 1,000,000 individuals annually and has a higher incidence in adults than pediatric patients, likely due to increased exposure to potential triggers. However, because SJS shares International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes with erythema multiforme, the incidence may be overestimated. Furthermore, 36–72% of patients initially diagnosed with SJS/TEN end up having their diagnosis reclassified into a different disease, also contributing to an overestimation of SJS/TEN incidence.

Incidence of SJS/TEN also varies by country, partly due to:

- **Genetic background differences**: For example, the Han Chinese have a high carrier rate of HLA-B✱15:02, an allele strongly associated with carbamazepine-induced SJS/TEN. This association explains why carbamazepine-induced SJS/TEN has a higher incidence in Southeast Asia than in Europe.
- **Differing prescribing patterns**: Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and tuberculosis (TB) endemic locales, like several countries in Africa, often have higher rates of SJS/TEN. This is owing to increased use of anti-HIV and anti-TB medications that pose a high risk for SJS/TEN.

Because it causes widespread detachment of skin and mucosal surfaces, SJS/TEN can lead to severe complications, including superimposed infection, sepsis, organ dysfunction, and death. Reported mortality rates are as high as 34–50%.

### Toxic epidermal necrolysis (Lyell's disease) [^116C4c9a]. Burns (2010). Low credibility.

Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) are severe adverse drug reactions characterized by low incidence but high mortality. Initially described as separate entities, they are now considered variants of the same pathologic process, differing only in severity. The majority of cases appear to be related to idiosyncratic drug reactions. The drugs most commonly involved are antibiotics such as sulfonamides, beta-lactam, tetracyclines, and quinolones; anticonvulsants such as phenytoin, phenobarbital, and carbamazepine; antiretroviral drugs; nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs; and allopurinol.

There is a common agreement to consider TEN as the manifestation of a dysregulated immune reaction against epithelial cells. During the first stages of TEN, apoptosis mediates keratinocyte death, and the pivotal role of Fas-FasL pathway activation during TEN is undoubted. T cell cytotoxicity, demonstrated during TEN, has been shown to be mediated by the perforin-granzyme pathway. It also seems clear that a peculiar cytokine pattern plays an important role in TEN pathogenesis.

The cutaneous findings result in an acute macular erythematous rash with bullae. These lesions rapidly exhibit Nikolsky's sign, and large sheets of epidermis separate from the dermis, leading to subsequent localized shedding that can become very extensive. When feasible, admission to a burn or intensive care unit, with patients positioned in air-fluidized beds, is universally considered crucial in TEN treatment. The prompt withdrawal of the suspected drug, fluid, and electrolyte balance are essential components of managing this condition.

### Management of ocular conditions in the burn unit: Thermal and chemical burns and Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis [^11569zRf]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2011). Low credibility.

Patients in burn intensive care units suffer from potentially life-threatening conditions, including thermal or chemical burns and Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis. There is often involvement of the ocular surface or adnexal structures, which may be present at the time of hospital admission or may develop later in the hospital course. This article will describe the types of ocular burns, the mechanisms and manifestations of Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis, the circumstances that may influence outcomes, and acute and long-term treatment strategies, including new and evolving options.

### TNF-α induced extracellular release of keratinocyte high-mobility group box 1 in Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis: Biomarker and putative mechanism of pathogenesis [^1121KwSe]. The Journal of Dermatology (2023). High credibility.

Having determined that TNF‐α induces HMGB1 release from a keratinocyte cell line, we examined its effect in a more physiologically relevant model: healthy human skin explants. This was done to assess whether in vitro observations could be reproduced. Exposure of healthy skin explants to TNF‐α for 72 hours induced grade 2 epidermal toxicity, compared to grade I toxicity in media-only treated explants. Although administration of etanercept did not abate toxicity, TNF‐α induced loss of epidermal HMGB1 expression, which was not seen in media-only controls, and this loss was negated by etanercept.

Extracellular levels of HMGB1 in the supernatant were significantly higher in TNF‐α treated explants (7.83 ng/mL ± 1.2) compared to controls (1.03 ng/mL ± 0.14, P < 0.05).

- **Figure 3**: Effect of 72 hours of 10 ng/mL TNF‐α or cutaneous ADR patient serum (control, lichenoid dermatitis, or SJS/TEN) exposure with or without 1 μg/mL etanercept on healthy skin explant morphology (H&E stained). Images show HMGB1 immunohistochemical expression and localization. Images are representative of n = 3 skin samples. For H&E images: black horizontal scale bar = 100 μm (400× magnification). For HMGB1: black horizontal bar = 60 μm (zoomed 40× whole slide scanned image). Dashed lines represent the dermal-epidermal junction.

Anakinra (positive control)-treated explants exhibited grade II/III toxicity or grade II in the presence of etanercept.

### Update on Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis: Diagnosis and management [^115AV37M]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2024). Low credibility.

Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) are the most severe cutaneous adverse reactions, typically drug-induced in adults. Both SJS and TEN have high morbidity and mortality rates, presenting clinical challenges for physicians due to their rarity and rapid progression as systemic diseases with severe cutaneous, mucosal, and systemic manifestations. Although many cases of SJS/TEN have been reported in the literature, a consensus regarding diagnostic criteria or treatment remains absent.

Significant progress has been made in understanding the genetic predisposition and pathogenesis of SJS/TEN. This review aims to provide physicians with a comprehensive but practical SJS/TEN roadmap to guide diagnosis and management. We review data on pathogenesis, reported precipitating factors, presentation, diagnosis, and management of SJS/TEN, focusing on recent advancements over the last five years.

### Diagnosis and management of Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis [^116TWZH2]. Clinics in Dermatology (2020). Low credibility.

Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis (SJS/TEN) is a rare, immunologically mediated cutaneous adverse reaction characterized by mucous membrane and epidermal detachment, with a mortality rate ranging from 15% to 25%. Risk factors for the development of SJS/TEN include immune dysregulation, active malignancy, and genetic predisposition. Medications are the most common cause, particularly antimicrobials, antiepileptics, allopurinol, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications. Drug-specific CD8 T-cells and natural killer cells are thought to be the major inducers of keratinocyte apoptosis via release of soluble cytotoxic mediators, including Fas ligand, perforin/granzyme, tumor necrosis factor, and granulysin.

When SJS/TEN is suspected clinically, appropriate therapy should be instituted without delay. All patients should be managed initially in an intensive care unit or burn unit under a multidisciplinary team of physicians experienced in the care of patients with SJS/TEN. Available data support the use of various pharmacologic agents to halt disease progression and improve outcomes, but no single drug has been found to be superior or beneficial for all patients. Future research should focus on developing a better understanding of the genetic susceptibility and immunopathophysiology of the disease, as well as novel diagnostic and therapeutic targets to improve patient outcomes.

### Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis: Consequence of treatment of an emerging pathogen [^1117wTxR]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2009). Low credibility.

We report a case of Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis (SJS/TEN) secondary to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-Sx) therapy for presumed community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) infection. Although the association between SJS/TEN and the sulfonamide class of antibiotics is well established, the increasing prevalence of CA-MRSA has left practitioners with limited regimens to effectively treat skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) in the outpatient setting.

In the case of SSTIs, alternative treatment of these infections should be considered, especially when the bacterial pathogen is unknown. Future investigations evaluating the efficacy of adjunctive antibiotics for purulent SSTIs and monitoring the incidence of SJS/TEN in the era of CA-MRSA are necessary to reduce unnecessary use of sulfonamide drugs. The potential development of SJS/TEN, a severe life-threatening illness, emphasizes the need for judicious use of TMP-Sx and close monitoring and follow-up for patients who were given TMP-Sx for SSTIs.

### Efficacy of plasmapheresis for the treatment of severe toxic epidermal necrolysis: Is cytokine expression analysis useful in predicting its therapeutic efficacy [^114tZSwW]. The Journal of Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) is a life-threatening, drug-induced disorder characterized by severe epidermal injury. Although there is no standard therapeutic intervention in TEN, plasmapheresis (PP) is increasingly used to treat extremely ill TEN patients. In addition to conventional PP, double-filtration PP (DFPP) has been recently employed for severe and refractory TEN. In this review, we focus on the clinical usefulness of PP by demonstrating three cases of TEN refractory to conventional therapies, which were successfully treated with conventional PP or DFPP, and evaluating its therapeutic efficiency. We also provide evidence to suggest the mechanisms of action of PP by investigating the correlation between disease intensity and serum cytokine levels before and after treatment with PP or DFPP in these patients with TEN. At present, PP is a much more effective option for the treatment of severe and/or recalcitrant TEN compared to other treatments, such as pulsed corticosteroids and intravenous immunoglobulin.

### SPL drug information for nadolol [^116s3Qqo]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Nadolol, also known as Corgard, carries a boxed warning concerning its use and the potential exacerbation of myocardial infarction, ventricular arrhythmia, and angina. Patients with coronary artery disease should not discontinue nadolol abruptly, as this could lead to severe exacerbations of angina, myocardial infarction, or ventricular arrhythmias. The dosage should be gradually reduced over 1–2 weeks while monitoring the patient for any adverse effects. If symptoms worsen or acute coronary insufficiency develops, nadolol should be reinstated promptly and appropriate measures taken. Abrupt discontinuation should be avoided even in patients treated for hypertension, as coronary artery disease may go unrecognized.

### Comparing mortality outcomes of major burns and toxic epidermal necrolysis in a tertiary burns centre [^112frszo]. Burns (2014). Low credibility.

Our aim was to provide descriptive information to burn clinicians, who have extensive experience treating major burns and determining prognosis, to ascertain whether significant differences in mortality exist between major burn injuries and the comparatively less common toxic epidermal necrolysis for a given age and total body surface area percentage.

- **Methods**: Retrospective data was analyzed for all deceased patients admitted to the Victorian Adult Burns Service in Melbourne, Australia over a period of 10 years, with greater than 30% total body surface area burned or greater than 30% total body surface area epidermal detachment in the case of toxic epidermal necrolysis. Retrospective data was also collected on all patients, survivors and deceased, with toxic epidermal necrolysis. These patients were matched with burns patients by age and percentage of total body surface area burned. Comparisons in outcomes were performed, with mortality being the primary variable of interest.

- **Results**: Toxic epidermal necrolysis patients who died were older (median age: 68.5 vs 57 years; P = 0.04), had a longer length of hospital stay (36.5 vs 0.8 days; P = 0.001), and significantly longer periods of mechanical ventilation (1404 vs 14.5 hours; P = 0.011) than major burn patients who died. When toxic epidermal necrolysis patients were matched to major burn patients by age and total body surface area burned, there were no significant differences between the two groups with respect to mortality.

- **Conclusion**: Palliative care approaches are more frequently administered at the time of presentation for major burns.

The majority of rash adverse reactions were Grade 1 (15% in the Ninlaro regimen and 9% in the placebo regimen) or Grade 2 (9% in the Ninlaro regimen and 4% in the placebo regimen) [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Grade 3 rash was reported in 3% of patients in the Ninlaro regimen and 2% of patients in the placebo regimen. Serious adverse reactions of rash were reported in less than 1% of patients in the Ninlaro regimen. The most common type of rash reported in both regimens included maculo-papular and macular rash. Rash resulted in discontinuation of one or more of the three drugs in less than 1% of patients in both regimens. Manage rash with supportive care or with dose modification, as needed.

### Toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN): The Chelsea and Westminster Hospital wound management algorithm [^115zNdGq]. Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive & Aesthetic Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Toxic epidermal necrolysis syndrome (TEN) is a potentially catastrophic exfoliative mucocutaneous disorder first described by Lyell in 1956. It represents the most extensive form of Steven-Johnson syndrome. In the United Kingdom, the consensus opinion describes the process as involving more than 30% of the total body surface area. It can rapidly become more extensive and threaten life. The estimated annual incidence is approximately 1–2 cases per million population.

The risk of mortality increases with the surface area involved, and meta-analysis of the literature shows this risk to be between 16% and 55%. Over a six-month period, the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital Burns Service treated five consecutive patients with more than 80% total body surface area involvement or a more than 80% mortality risk, using the severity-of-illness score for toxic epidermal necrolysis (SCORTEN). All patients were treated according to the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital wound management algorithm with excellent outcomes and no mortalities.

The aim of this paper is to propose a generic TEN wound management algorithm according to the severity of skin lesions, using a simple wound grading system.

### Alden, an algorithm for assessment of drug causality in Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis: Comparison with case-control analysis [^1144hQ7j]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2010). High credibility.

The ALDEN score, or Algorithm of Drug Causality for Epidermal Necrolysis, is a clinical calculator used in the field of dermatology. It is specifically designed for patients who have developed severe skin reactions, such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), which are often drug-induced. The ALDEN score helps clinicians to identify the likelihood that a specific drug has caused the skin reaction in a patient.

The clinical utility of the ALDEN score is to guide clinicians in identifying the causative drug in cases of SJS and TEN, which is crucial for preventing further exposure to the drug and managing the patient's condition. It takes into account factors such as the timing of drug exposure, the latency period, and the drug's inherent likelihood of causing such reactions.

There are no specific exclusion criteria for the use of the ALDEN score. However, it should be noted that the score is less reliable in cases where the patient has been exposed to multiple drugs or when the onset of the skin reaction is not clear. It is also less useful in cases where the reaction is not drug-induced.

The Algorithm of Drug Causality for Epidermal Necrolysis (ALDEN score) is a tool designed to evaluate the involvement of drugs in triggering Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis (SJS/TEN). By assessing several key criteria related to drug intake, history, and associated risks, the calculator provides insights into the causative factors.

### Intravenous immune globulin therapy for Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis complicated by hemolysis leading to pigment nephropathy and hemodialysis [^117KRzaw]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) is generally considered to carry a relatively low risk for adverse events, and some experts regard it as the optimal treatment for Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis.

- **Objective**: We evaluated the underlying cause of anemia and renal failure in two consecutive patients being treated with IVIG for Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis.

- **Methods**: This is a retrospective chart review.

- **Results**: We present two patients with Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis and severe hemolysis requiring blood transfusion. These patients subsequently developed pigment nephropathy necessitating hemodialysis after treatment with IVIG. Both patients had antibodies to their ABO blood type detected in the eluate from their red blood cell membrane.

- **Limitations**: This is a retrospective review with only two cases.

- **Conclusions**: We propose that IVIG-associated hemolysis may be a more common adverse reaction than previously thought, presenting as a mild decrease in hemoglobin and hematocrit. Antibodies to blood type A and B are included in pooled immune globulin and are considered to be the cause of hemolysis. While more severe anemia requiring transfusion is less common, the breakdown products produced by hemolysis can lead to pigment nephropathy and renal failure. We outline methods by which this severe complication can be anticipated and managed more effectively.

### TNF-α induced extracellular release of keratinocyte high-mobility group box 1 in Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis: Biomarker and putative mechanism of pathogenesis [^114gUqq7]. Journal of Dermatology (2023). High credibility.

Decreased epidermal high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) expression is an early marker of epidermal injury in Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis (SJS/TEN). Etanercept, an anti-tumor necrosis factor therapeutic, is effective in the treatment of SJS/TEN. The objective was to characterize antitumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α)-mediated HMGB1 keratinocyte/epidermal release and etanercept modulation. HMGB1 release from TNF-α treated (± etanercept) or doxycycline-inducible RIPK3 or Bak-expressing human keratinocyte cells (HaCaTs) was determined by western blot/ELISA.

Healthy skin explants were treated with TNF-α or serum (1:10 dilution) from immune checkpoint inhibitor-tolerant, lichenoid dermatitis, or SJS/TEN patients ± etanercept. Histological and immunohistochemical analysis of HMGB1 was undertaken. TNF-α induced HMGB1 release in vitro via both necroptosis and apoptosis. Exposure of skin explants to TNF-α or SJS/TEN serum resulted in significant epidermal toxicity/detachment with substantial HMGB1 release, which was attenuated by etanercept.

Whole-slide image analysis of biopsies demonstrated significantly lower epidermal HMGB1 in pre-blistered SJS/TEN versus control (P < 0.05). Keratinocyte HMGB1 release, predominantly caused by necroptosis, can be attenuated by etanercept. Although TNF-α is a key mediator of epidermal HMGB1 release, other cytokines/cytotoxic proteins also contribute. Skin explant models represent a potential model of SJS/TEN that could be utilized for further mechanistic studies and targeted therapy screening.

### Serum and blister-fluid elevation and decreased epidermal content of high-mobility group box 1 protein in drug-induced Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis [^112769iU]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

Samples from three independent SJS/TEN patient cohorts were brought together for the purpose of this study.

- **Nevirapine patient cohort**: Patients were prospectively recruited, as previously described, after informed consent was obtained. The study was approved by the research ethics committees of the College of Medicine, Malawi, and the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, Liverpool, U.K. Briefly, the study recruited 1117 antiretroviral‐naive HIV‐positive patients from the Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital, Blantyre, Malawi, between March 2007 and December 2008. All participants self‐reported as black African, were over the age of 16 years, and presented no baseline jaundice. All patients were diagnosed with clinical stage 3/4 HIV or had a CD4+ count less than or equal to 250 cells per microliter. SJS was classified as those with less than 10% of the body surface area (BSA) affected and two or more mucous membranes involved. TEN was classified as having effects on more than 30% of BSA and two or more mucous membranes. Patients with 10–30% affected BSA were identified as having the overlap syndrome.

### TNF-α induced extracellular release of keratinocyte high-mobility group box 1 in Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis: Biomarker and putative mechanism of pathogenesis [^117Enbd5]. The Journal of Dermatology (2023). Low credibility.

The work presented in skin explant models demonstrates that TNF‐α can induce epidermal release of HMGB1 (Figure 3) and grade 2 toxicity (Supporting Information Table S4), which leads to elevated supernatant levels (Supporting Information Figure S3). However, whilst the addition of etanercept negated epidermal release, it did not reduce extracellular levels. TNF‐α is known to induce HMGB1 release from monocytes, and it is therefore possible that the extracellular levels of HMGB1 in SJS/TEN are due to TNF‐α‐induced release by both epidermal and immune cells and are not only due to epidermal loss of expression.

An alternative hypothesis is that etanercept itself increases HMGB1 release from activated immune cells, which counters the inhibition of HMGB1 release from injured keratinocytes by etanercept. This also suggests that etanercept has an effect on both inflammatory cells and keratinocytes. This is also true of anakinra, which would explain the very large increase in HMGB1 that is seen and the lack of reduction in the presence of etanercept.

Epidermal expression of HMGB1 was significantly decreased by exposure to SJS/TEN patient serum at 1:10 dilution (Figure 3) and marginally restored by etanercept. This mirrored the effect on toxicity, where a marginal decrease was seen in response to etanercept. This suggests that TNF‐α might play a role in mediating HMGB1 release and toxicity in SJS/TEN, but HMGB1 release is also attributable to non‐TNF‐α‐mediated pathways.

### TNF-α induced extracellular release of keratinocyte high-mobility group box 1 in Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis: Biomarker and putative mechanism of pathogenesis [^114Y6cgi]. The Journal of Dermatology (2023). High credibility.

Stevens–Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis (SJS/TEN) is a rare immune‐mediated cutaneous blistering condition, most often caused by drugs and characterized by widespread keratinocyte death and epidermal detachment. Although much is known about the immunopathogenesis of SJS/TEN, there are still gaps in our understanding of how cell death and epidermal detachment occur.

Previous work demonstrated that epidermal expression of high‐mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) protein can discriminate between severe cutaneous adverse drug reactions (ADRs) like SJS/TEN and maculopapular exanthema. HMGB1 is a damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) protein which, in its unacetylated form, acts as a marker of sterile toxicity and, in its acetylated form, serves as a marker of innate immune response.

Etanercept is an anti-tumor necrosis factor‐alpha (TNF‐α) monoclonal antibody used for treating auto‐inflammatory conditions including psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis. Several case studies have suggested that it is an effective treatment for SJS/TEN and reduces mortality compared to standard care (high‐dose prednisolone). Despite reports of rapid re‐epithelialization in response to etanercept, there is currently limited understanding of its specific mechanism of action in SJS/TEN treatment. Studies suggest that T‐cell derived TNF‐α contributes to keratinocyte cell death via Fas ligand; however, necroptosis is identified as the key cell death mechanism responsible for significant keratinocyte death seen in SJS/TEN, but its modulation by TNF‐α remains to be established.

### Comparison of the acute ocular manifestations of Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis in Chinese eyes: a 15-year retrospective study [^113dkzaz]. BMC Ophthalmology (2017). Low credibility.

Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) are rare but life-threatening conditions that initially affect the skin and mucous membranes. The aim of this study was to compare the acute ocular manifestations between SJS and TEN.

- **Methods**: The initial presenting ophthalmic records of patients with either SJS (30% involvement), who were treated at one tertiary burn center in Hong Kong between 1999 and 2014, were retrospectively analyzed and compared.

- **Results**: A total of 20 SJS and 12 TEN cases were included. All were drug-induced. The patient demographics and treatment received were comparable. Overall, 40% of SJS and 75% of TEN patients had acute ocular surface inflammation. When comparing the two groups, there was a significant difference in the number of cases with mild involvement (5% in SJS, 42% in TEN, p = 0.01), while no statistically significant differences were found (p > 0.05) between the moderate (15% in SJS, 0% in TEN) and severe groups (20% in SJS, 33% in TEN).

- **Conclusions**: Ocular surface inflammation was common during the acute phase in both SJS and TEN. TEN had a significantly higher number of cases with mild ocular involvement when compared with SJS, but there was no significant difference between the number of moderate and severe cases between the two groups.

### Intense pulsed light treatment of persistent facial hypermelanosis following drug-induced toxic epidermal necrolysis [^113WBjRH]. Dermatologic Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

Cutaneous hyperpigmentation is one of the most cosmetically disturbing sequelae of drug-induced toxic epidermal necrolysis. Intense pulsed light is a promising tool for treating some melanocytic lesions.

- **Objective**: The objective was to assess the effect of intense pulsed light in treating post-toxic epidermal necrolysis facial hypermelanosis.

- **Methods**: Two Caucasian men aged 35 and 50 years presented with long-standing (32 and 39 years) severe hypermelanosis of the face after sulfonamide-induced toxic epidermal necrolysis. They were treated with intense pulsed light. Cutoff filters of 550, 590, and 615 nm were employed for five intense pulsed light sessions at 4-week intervals. The treatment was characterized by energy fluence of 25 to 32 J/cm², pulse width of 2.2 to 3.2 ms, and double- to triple-pulse mode respecting a 30-ms delay. Before intense pulsed light treatment, and 2 months after the fifth session, clinical photographs and skin biopsies were performed in combination with quantitative narrow-band remittance spectrophotometry of melanin pigmentation. Patients were clinically followed up for 8 months after the end of the treatment.

- **Results**: In both patients, clinical, histologic, and spectrophotometric assessments showed an average of 80% decrease in hypermelanosis. No clinical recurrence of the hypermelanosis developed during the 8-month follow-up after intense pulsed light treatment. No major persistent side effects were experienced, especially hypopigmentation.

- **Conclusion**: Intense pulsed light appears to be effective and safe for treating persistent facial hypermelanosis following toxic epidermal necrolysis.

### The life-threatening rash of poisoning [^112ueQkQ]. Clinics in Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Dermatology is frequently viewed by physician and surgical colleagues as a specialty with few emergencies. Although the majority of dermatology practice occurs in the office setting, cutaneous emergencies do arise through referrals from primary care and as ward consultations. Even though cutaneous signs of poisoning are uncommon emergency consultations, it is crucial for dermatologists to be aware of the clinical presentations to instigate appropriate time-critical treatments.

### Vectibix [^112RRiKC]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Dermatologic and soft tissue toxicity**: Vectibix can cause severe dermatologic toxicity. Clinical manifestations include, but are not limited to, acneiform dermatitis, pruritus, erythema, rash, skin exfoliation, paronychia, dry skin, and skin fissures.

Among 229 patients who received Vectibix as monotherapy, 90% experienced dermatologic toxicity, including Grade 3 toxicity in 15% of cases. In 585 patients receiving Vectibix in combination with FOLFOX, 96% developed dermatologic toxicity, including Grade 4 toxicity in 1% and Grade 3 toxicity in 32%. For 126 patients receiving Vectibix combined with sotorasib in clinical studies, 94% experienced dermatologic toxicities, with 16% at Grade 3 severity.

Patients developing dermatologic or soft tissue toxicities while on Vectibix should be monitored for inflammatory or infectious sequelae. Life-threatening and fatal infectious complications, such as necrotizing fasciitis, abscesses, and sepsis, have been reported in patients treated with Vectibix. Additionally, life-threatening and fatal bullous mucocutaneous diseases, characterized by blisters, erosions, and skin sloughing, have been observed. It is unclear whether these mucocutaneous adverse reactions are related to EGFR inhibition or idiosyncratic immune-related effects, such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis. Vectibix should be withheld or discontinued in cases of severe or life-threatening dermatologic or soft tissue toxicity associated with inflammatory or infectious complications.

### Etanercept therapy for toxic epidermal necrolysis [^11564cAA]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) is a severe and potentially lethal drug reaction for which no standard treatment is available.

- **Objective**: To describe a case series of patients with TEN treated with a single dose of etanercept.

- **Methods**: We observed 10 consecutive patients with TEN. For each patient, we recorded the presence of comorbidities and all the drugs recently started (i.e. in the last month). In all cases, 50 mg of etanercept was administered in a single subcutaneous injection. The clinical severity of disease was computed using the SCORe of Toxic Epidermal Necrosis (SCORTEN) scale. Using the probabilities of death linked to each level of SCORTEN score, we calculated the expected probability of death in our patients. Healing was defined as complete reepithelialization, and a time to healing curve was then obtained using the Kaplan-Meier method.

- **Results**: All patients promptly responded to treatment, reaching complete reepithelialization without complications or side effects. The median time to healing was 8.5 days.

- **Limitations**: This is a small, uncontrolled case series.

- **Conclusion**: These preliminary results suggest the possibility that tumor necrosis factor-alpha may be an effective target for control of TEN, a dangerous skin condition for which no effective cure has yet been found.

### A 2-year-old girl with Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis treated with intravenous immunoglobulin [^111nGaxC]. Pediatric Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

Toxic epidermal necrolysis and Stevens-Johnson syndrome are severe skin reactions, usually to drugs, associated with a widespread destruction of the epidermis. Widespread purpuric macules and epidermal detachment of less than 10% of the body surface are indicative of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, whereas epidermal detachment between 10% and 30% is called Stevens-Johnson-toxic epidermal necrolysis overlap. Epidermal detachment involving more than 30% of the total body surface is designated as toxic epidermal necrolysis. These generalized reactions are known to occur in association with various drugs. Treatment is primarily supportive care, and there are no specific therapy regimens.

- **Symptomatic therapeutic approaches**: Therapeutic modalities such as corticosteroids, cyclosporin, thalidomide, cyclophosphamide, and plasmapheresis, usually based on a symptomatic approach, have been tried in single patients or in small series. Intravenous immunoglobulin has recently been shown to provide rapid improvement in all three of these skin reactions.

We report a 2-year-old girl who developed Stevens-Johnson syndrome-toxic epidermal necrolysis overlap after receiving ampicillin-sulbactam for an upper respiratory tract infection. She was treated successfully with a 4-day course of intravenous immunoglobulin.
