## Question

What is the migraine cocktail to give in the emergency room

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what constitutes an evidence-based "migraine cocktail" for the emergency room. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and goals of ED migraine care. Then, I should verify which components have the strongest evidence and how they fit into a multi-drug regimen. Next, I will examine dosing, routes, and safety, including what to avoid. After that, I should consider special populations and alternatives if first-line agents are contraindicated. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stepwise "cocktail" and confirm the strength of evidence and any uncertainties before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and goals. ED migraine care prioritizes rapid pain relief, control of associated symptoms like nausea, prevention of early recurrence, and avoidance of opioids; I need to ensure the regimen aligns with these aims and with high-quality ED policies and meta-analyses that discourage opioid use and support nonopioid strategies with attention to relapse prevention [^47ede59f] [^d3c1c717].

> Next, I should review the core components with the strongest evidence. Antidopaminergic antiemetics are foundational in ED migraine therapy; metoclopramide and prochlorperazine reduce pain and nausea, with metoclopramide supported by a meta-analysis showing improved pain reduction versus placebo and utility as a primary agent in ED care, and prochlorperazine outperforming hydromorphone for sustained relief in a randomized ED trial, so I should anchor the cocktail on one of these agents [^3c872593] [^86a321bf].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of NSAIDs and whether to combine. Ketorolac is commonly used parenterally in ED practice and performs reasonably well in comparative ED trials, though network meta-analytic signals suggest it may be less effective than some alternatives; still, pairing an NSAID with an antiemetic is a rational, guideline-concordant approach, and the combination of a triptan with an NSAID has robust outpatient evidence for superior outcomes, which supports the mechanistic synergy even if ED data are heterogeneous [^61c25188] [^8298ca83] [^bd4b527c].

> I need to check the adjunctive role of corticosteroids for preventing recurrence. Multiple ED-focused meta-analyses indicate that a single dose of dexamethasone added to standard therapy reduces moderate-to-severe headache recurrence at 24–72 hours by roughly 9–10% absolute risk, with favorable safety in single-dose use; thus, dexamethasone should be included when the attack is severe, prolonged, or there is a history of early recurrence, while acknowledging that it is not for immediate pain relief itself [^750b19c0] [^d1fce4a7] [^880c5b4c].

> Let me consider what to avoid. Opioids consistently underperform and increase risks; hydromorphone is inferior to prochlorperazine for sustained relief, and meperidine is less effective than dihydroergotamine and antiemetics with more sedation and dizziness, so opioids should not be used for routine ED migraine care; I should double-check that this stance is echoed by ED policies, which it is [^86a321bf] [^590e066f] [^d3c1c717].

> Now, I will examine dosing and routes, but wait, let me verify specifics. Metoclopramide 10 mg IV is a standard starting dose, with dose-finding work showing similar efficacy across 10–40 mg but no clear advantage to higher doses; prochlorperazine 10 mg IV or IM is effective, and many ED protocols pair it with diphenhydramine 25–50 mg to mitigate akathisia, though a randomized trial did not show added benefit from diphenhydramine when combined with metoclopramide, so I should individualize antihistamine use rather than assume benefit; ketorolac 30 mg IV or 60 mg IM is a common ED dose; dexamethasone 8–10 mg IV as a single dose is supported for relapse prevention [^4dd447d5] [^86a321bf] [^1c821845] [^750b19c0].

> But wait, what if triptans are appropriate in the ED. I initially thought triptans were contraindicated in the ED due to vascular risk screening constraints; hold on, I should verify that. While many EDs avoid triptans for logistical reasons, sumatriptan is effective in ED trials and guidelines allow triptans when vascular disease is absent; in practice, if a patient has no contraindications and reliable follow-up, subcutaneous sumatriptan 6 mg can be considered, and combining sumatriptan with naproxen improves sustained outcomes, though this is more often feasible in observation or infusion settings than in busy EDs [^47ede59f] [^8298ca83] [^bd4b527c].

> I should confirm alternatives for refractory cases or when first-line agents are contraindicated. Dihydroergotamine 1 mg IV or IM, often paired with an antiemetic, is a reasonable second-line option for refractory migraine or when triptans are not suitable; valproate IV has been studied but shows inferior acute pain reduction compared with metoclopramide or ketorolac in ED trials, so it is not preferred for initial therapy; intranasal lidocaine has mixed and limited ED evidence and is not routinely recommended [^61c25188] [^7735b447] [^7ddb1f3e].

> Next, I should review special populations. In pregnancy, I need to avoid triptans, ergots, and dexamethasone; acetaminophen is first-line and antiemetics like metoclopramide are acceptable, with careful risk–benefit discussion. In pediatrics, evidence is limited and extrapolated; prochlorperazine may outperform metoclopramide for preventing revisits, and diphenhydramine co-administration has been associated with increased revisits, so I should avoid routine diphenhydramine with dopamine antagonists in children and tailor therapy to severity and nausea [^8ba7dd3c].

> Let me synthesize a practical ED "migraine cocktail" while keeping the evidence hierarchy in mind. A reasonable first-line regimen is metoclopramide 10 mg IV plus ketorolac 30 mg IV, with consideration of diphenhydramine 25–50 mg IV if akathisia risk is a concern, recognizing the mixed evidence for antihistamine benefit; add dexamethasone 8–10 mg IV for severe attacks, prolonged duration, or prior early recurrence; avoid opioids; consider subcutaneous sumatriptan 6 mg if no vascular contraindications and appropriate follow-up is assured, especially for rapid relief or as part of a monitored pathway [^3c872593] [^61c25188] [^750b19c0] [^47ede59f].

> Hold on, I should verify the strength of evidence and uncertainties. The antiemetic backbone has the most consistent ED evidence, NSAID co-therapy is supported by mechanistic rationale and outpatient data though ED-specific comparative effectiveness varies, and dexamethasone for relapse prevention has reproducible benefit across meta-analyses; network meta-analytic rankings suggest chlorpromazine may be among the most effective single agents for 2-hour relief, but confidence intervals overlap and ED implementation must balance efficacy, safety, and workflow, so local protocolization is key [^3c872593] [^750b19c0] [^d2bf1d3f].

> Finally, I need to ensure discharge planning and follow-up are addressed. Providing education to avoid opioids, supplying NSAIDs and/or a triptan with clear instructions, and arranging timely follow-up reduce recurrence and improve outcomes; I should confirm that patients understand red flags, rescue strategies, and when to return, as this closes the loop on ED care and supports sustained relief beyond the immediate treatment window [^d3c1c717].

The standard ER migraine cocktail is **metoclopramide 10 mg IV plus ketorolac 30 mg IV** [^3c872593] [^61c25188], with **dexamethasone 10 mg IV** added to reduce recurrence [^750b19c0] [^d1fce4a7]. This regimen provides rapid pain relief, controls nausea, and lowers 24–72 hour rebound headache risk [^3c872593] [^750b19c0]. Avoid opioids due to inferior efficacy and higher adverse effects [^590e066f]; reserve them for refractory cases only [^d3c1c717]. For pediatric patients, use **ketorolac 0.5 mg/kg IV/IM** (max 30 mg) with **prochlorperazine 0.15 mg/kg IV** (max 10 mg) and consider ondansetron for nausea [^6b3aa9a9].

## Core components of the migraine cocktail

Key characteristics of core migraine cocktail components:

| **Aspect** | **Metoclopramide** | **Ketorolac** | **Dexamethasone** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Mechanism of action | Dopamine antagonist with antiemetic and prokinetic effects; reduces nausea and enhances gastric motility [^3c872593] | NSAID that inhibits prostaglandin synthesis, providing analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects [^notfound] | Corticosteroid that reduces neurogenic inflammation and lowers recurrence risk [^880c5b4c] |
| Clinical evidence | Multiple RCTs and meta-analyses show significant pain reduction and nausea control; comparable to triptans in some studies [^3c872593] [^71a85a90] | Effective for acute migraine pain; often combined with metoclopramide for enhanced relief [^61c25188] | Meta-analyses show modest reduction in recurrence at 24–72 hours when added to standard therapy [^750b19c0] [^d1fce4a7] |
| Dosing | 10 mg IV over 2 minutes; repeat once if needed [^4dd447d5] | 30 mg IV or 60 mg IM; single dose [^notfound] | 10 mg IV once [^a3a053b7] |
| Adverse effects | Akathisia, dystonia, sedation; mitigate with diphenhydramine 25–50 mg IV [^4dd447d5] | GI upset, bleeding risk; use cautiously in renal impairment [^notfound] | Hyperglycemia, insomnia, mood changes; minimal with single dose [^d1fce4a7] |

---

## Alternative and adjunctive therapies

- **Prochlorperazine**: 10 mg IV/IM; effective alternative to metoclopramide; consider diphenhydramine 25 mg IV to reduce akathisia [^86a321bf].
- **Ondansetron**: 4 mg IV for nausea/vomiting; does not treat pain but improves comfort [^notfound].
- **Magnesium sulfate**: 2 g IV over 20 minutes; consider for refractory cases or with aura; evidence is mixed [^71953e9a] [^7ddb1f3e].
- **Dihydroergotamine (DHE)**: 1 mg IV/IM/SC; for refractory cases; avoid with triptans or vascular disease [^notfound].

---

## Medications to avoid

Avoid **opioids** (e.g. morphine, hydromorphone, meperidine) due to inferior efficacy, higher adverse effects, and increased recurrence risk [^590e066f] [^86a321bf]. Also avoid **butalbital-containing compounds** because of rebound headache and dependence risk [^98dfddf7].

---

## Special considerations

### Pediatric patients

Use **ketorolac 0.5 mg/kg IV/IM** (max 30 mg) and **prochlorperazine 0.15 mg/kg IV** (max 10 mg); add **ondansetron 0.15 mg/kg IV** for nausea [^notfound]. Evidence is limited; tailor therapy to response and tolerability [^6b3aa9a9].

---

### Pregnant patients

Use **acetaminophen 1,000 mg PO/IV** as first-line; avoid NSAIDs after 20 weeks. Consider **metoclopramide 10 mg IV** for nausea; avoid triptans and ergots [^notfound].

---

### Elderly patients

Start at lower doses and monitor closely for adverse effects; adjust for renal function and comorbidities [^notfound].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Monitor for **pain relief, nausea control, and adverse effects** for 1–2 hours after treatment. Provide discharge instructions on trigger avoidance, hydration, and medication use. Arrange follow-up to assess recurrence and consider preventive therapy if attacks are frequent or severe [^d3c1c717].

---

The standard ER migraine cocktail is **metoclopramide 10 mg IV plus ketorolac 30 mg IV**, with **dexamethasone 10 mg IV** added to reduce recurrence. This regimen balances efficacy, safety, and recurrence prevention, and should be individualized based on patient factors and contraindications.

Acute episodic migraine — triptan plus acetaminophen combination, compared with triptan monotherapy, may result in no important differences in pain freedom and relief at 2 hours, sustained pain freedom up to 48 hours, freedom from nausea at 2 hours, and restored physical function at 2 hours after initiating treatment, with low-certainty evidence and no important differences in overall AEs and uncertain serious AEs; compared with acetaminophen monotherapy, combination therapy resulted in a probably higher likelihood of pain freedom at 2 hours (300 more events per 1000 treated people) and sustained pain freedom up to 48 hours (250 more events per 1000 treated people), but may result in a higher risk for overall AEs (200 more events per 1000 treated people; low-certainty evidence); and compared with an NSAID, low-certainty evidence showed that this combination may result in a higher likelihood of pain freedom at 2 hours.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the evaluation and management of adult patients presenting to the emergency department with acute headache [^47ede59f]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Emergency department migraine interventions — meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials with the objective to identify interventions for acute pain relief in adults presenting with migraine to emergency settings included only studies using the ICHD-II for migraine; studies were graded according to risk of bias per the Cochrane Handbook, with final ratings per the US Preventive Services Task Force; groups of 2 or more trials without significant clinical heterogeneity were combined in meta-analyses and odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. Sumatriptan vs placebo: pooled OR for pain relief 8.41 (95% CI 6.96 to 10.16); other findings are consensus recommendations based on heterogeneous literature of good, fair, and, poor quality, and limitations note that the section about opiate medications had poor-quality articles with significant heterogeneity and that recommendations mostly were without pooled estimates, aside from sumatriptan; article methods more aligned with consensus recommendations than a focused meta-analysis article.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the evaluation and management of adult patients presenting to the emergency department with acute headache [^750b19c0]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Acute migraine headache in the emergency department (ED) — a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials evaluated dexamethasone added to standard migraine therapy for the prevention of headache relapse (Class of Evidence III for Q2), with the primary outcome being the proportion of migraine patients with self-reported moderate or severe headache at 24- to 72-h follow-up. Pooled analysis of 7 trials involving 742 patients suggested a modest but significant benefit when dexamethasone was added to standard therapy, with risk ratio 0.87; 95% CI 0.80 to 0.95; absolute risk reduction 9.7%. The treatment of 1,000 patients with acute migraine headache using dexamethasone in addition to standard migraine therapy would be expected to prevent 97 patients from experiencing moderate or severe headache at 24 to 72 h after ED evaluation. Limitations noted were indirect evidence, no opiate comparator, and inclusion of abstracts, making study quality assessment difficult.

### Treatment recommendations for migraine [^d64255bb]. Nature Clinical Practice: Neurology (2008). Medium credibility.

The pharmacological treatment of migraine can be acute or preventive. Acute treatment attempts to stop the progression of an attack or relieve pain and functional impairment once an attack has begun, whereas preventive therapy is given to reduce attack frequency and severity. Additional benefits of preventive therapy include improving responsiveness to acute attack treatment, and reducing disability. Treatment protocols should also include education and reassurance, avoidance of triggers, nonpharmacological treatments, and physical and/or complementary medicine when appropriate. The treatment plan should be reassessed at regular intervals. Acute attack medication can be specific or nonspecific, and needs to be tailored to the individual patient. Backup and rescue medication should be available in case the initial treatment fails. The route of drug administration depends on attack severity, how rapidly the attack escalates, the patient's preference, the presence or absence of severe nausea or vomiting, and the need for rapid relief. Preventive migraine treatments include beta-blockers, antidepressants, calcium channel antagonists, 5-hydroxytryptamine antagonists, anticonvulsants, and NSAIDs. Preventive treatments are selected on the basis of the drugs' side-effect profiles and the patient's coexistent and comorbid conditions.

### Guidelines of the international headache society for controlled trials of acute treatment of migraine attacks in adults: fourth edition [^c9e5e877]. Cephalalgia (2019). Medium credibility.

1.2.9. Timing of administration

Recommendations:

1.2.9.1. The timing of acute treatment should be defined in the trial protocol.

1.2.9.2. Usually, participants are instructed to treat when migraine headache pain is of at least moderate intensity, but alternatives include treating as soon as possible after headache onset, treating when pain intensity is mild, and treating when pain intensity is severe.

1.2.9.3. The timing of acute treatment must be consistent with the objectives of the trial.

1.2.9.4. Subjects should record the time and pain intensity at the time of treatment in the trial diary.

Comments:

The head pain of migraine frequently begins with mild intensity, progressively increases with variable speed to a peak, and is followed by resolution; headache pain can also fluctuate spontaneously during a migraine attack. These characteristics can pose challenges regarding the timing of treatment (e.g. early or when the attack is fully developed) and the evaluation of trial results. For example, healthcare providers typically recommend treating early in the course of a migraine attack, while pain intensity is mild, because it can enhance efficacy. At the beginning of an attack, however, migraine without aura can be difficult to distinguish from non-migraine headaches. Thus, subjects in migraine clinical trials who are instructed to treat as soon as possible (i.e. at the first sign of migraine) may mistakenly treat other headache types. The potential for confusion is mitigated when attacks are allowed to fully develop. Having subjects wait until pain intensity is moderate or severe before treating increases the specificity of migraine diagnoses. Yet because this strategy conflicts with common clinical advice about early treatment, it is essential that participants in clinical trials receive clear instruction about when to use acute treatment. In later stages of development, depending on the specific objectives of the program, trials evaluating early intervention and treatment when headache pain intensity is severe (e.g. for early morning migraine) are encouraged when investigating the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of new treatments.

### Guidelines of the international headache society for controlled trials of acute treatment of migraine attacks in adults: fourth edition [^ac68599a]. Cephalalgia (2019). Medium credibility.

1.3.4.18. Treatment of relapse

Recommendation:

The efficacy of treatment for headache relapse should be measured by the percentage of subjects with pain freedom 2 hours after the administration of treatment for headache relapse.

Comments:

Relapse of headache pain of any intensity can be treated with active treatment or placebo in a randomised, double-blind clinical trial. Participants should be re-randomized to active treatment or placebo for the second dose. Measured by the pain relief endpoint, the efficacy of certain acute medications (e.g. oral triptans) is similar whether the primary or the relapsing headache is treated.

### International headache society global practice recommendations for the acute pharmacological treatment of migraine [^43ca56e7]. Cephalalgia (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

In an effort to improve migraine management around the world, the International Headache Society (IHS) has here developed a list of practical recommendations for the acute pharmacological treatment of migraine. The recommendations are categorized into optimal and essential, in order to provide treatment options for all possible settings, including those with limited access to migraine medications.

Methods

An IHS steering committee developed a list of clinical questions based on practical issues in the management of migraine. A selected group of international senior and junior headache experts developed the recommendations, following expert consensus and the review of available national and international headache guidelines and guidance documents. Following the initial search, a bibliography of twenty-one national and international guidelines was created and reviewed by the working group.

Results

A total of seventeen questions addressing different aspects of acute migraine treatment have been outlined. For each of them we provide an optimal recommendation, to be used whenever possible, and an essential recommendation to be used when the optimal level cannot be attained.

Conclusion

Adoption of these international recommendations will improve the quality of acute migraine treatment around the world, even where pharmacological options remain limited.

### Diphenhydramine as adjuvant therapy for acute migraine: an emergency department-based randomized clinical trial [^1c821845]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Study Objective

More than 1 million patients present to US emergency departments (EDs) annually seeking care for acute migraine. Parenteral antihistamines have long been used in combination with antidopaminergics such as metoclopramide to treat acute migraine in the ED. High-quality data supporting this practice do not exist. We determine whether administration of diphenhydramine 50 mg intravenously+metoclopramide 10 mg intravenously results in greater rates of sustained headache relief than placebo+metoclopramide 10 mg intravenously.

Methods

This was a randomized, double-blind, clinical trial comparing 2 active treatments for acute migraine in an ED. Eligible patients were adults younger than 65 years presenting with an acute moderate or severe headache meeting International Classification of Headache Disorders-2 migraine criteria. Patients were stratified according to presence or absence of allergic symptoms. The primary outcome was sustained headache relief, defined as achieving a headache level of mild or none within 2 hours of medication administration and maintaining this level of relief without use of any additional headache medication for 48 hours. Secondary efficacy outcomes included mean improvement on a 0 to 10 verbal scale between baseline and 1 hour, the frequency with which subjects indicated they would want the same medication the next time they present to the ED with migraine, and the ED throughput time. Sample size calculation using a 2-sided α of .05, a β of .20, and a 15% difference between study arms determined the need for 374 patients. An interim analysis was conducted when data were available for 200 subjects.

Results

Four hundred twenty patients were approached for participation. Two hundred eight eligible patients consented to participate and were randomized. At the planned interim analysis, the data and safety monitoring board recommended that the study be halted for futility. Baseline characteristics were comparable between the groups. Fourteen percent (29/208) of the sample reported allergic symptoms. Of patients randomized to diphenhydramine, 40% (40/100) reported sustained relief at 48 hours, as did 37% (38/103) of patients randomized to placebo (95% confidence interval [CI] for difference of 3%: -10% to 16%). One hour after medication administration, patients randomized to diphenhydramine improved by a mean of 5.1 on the 0 to 10 scale versus 4.8 for those randomized to placebo (95% CI for difference of 0.3: -0.6 to 1.1). Eighty-five percent (84/99) of the patients in the diphenhydramine arm reported they would want the same medication combination during a subsequent ED visit, as did 76% (77/102) of those who received placebo (95% CI for difference of 9%: -2% to 20%). Median ED length of stay was 122 minutes (interquartile range 84 to 180 minutes) in the diphenhydramine group and 139 minutes (interquartile range 90 to 235 minutes) in the placebo arm. Rates of adverse effects, including akathisia, were comparable between the groups.

Conclusion

Intravenous diphenhydramine, when administered as adjuvant therapy with metoclopramide, does not improve migraine outcomes.

Evidence gaps and research needs — comparative effectiveness trials are prioritized and should emphasize combination therapy comparators and inadequate responders. "There is a critical need for funding agencies, such as the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute or National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, to support well-designed, comparative effectiveness trials of newer medications to treat moderate to severe episodic migraine compared with the combination of a triptan and an NSAID or acetaminophen". "These trials should focus on the combination therapies as initial treatment options and in patients who did not achieve adequate relief with an initial pharmacologic treatment after a moderate to severe episodic migraine", and "The trials should aim to treat multiple migraine headaches". The systematic review "did not identify head-to-head comparative studies for lasmiditan, celecoxib, eletriptan, frovatriptan, or naratriptan", and "did not find comparative effectiveness evidence eligible for this clinical guideline to evaluate the efficacy of switching pharmacologic treatments in patients who did not achieve adequate relief with an initial pharmacologic treatment attempt for an acute migraine headache".

Committee composition and evidence review methods — The CGC is a multidisciplinary group of 14 to 15 members, including 12 to 13 internal medicine physicians and 2 nonphysician public members, and a CGC Public Panel with 6 public members provided input during guideline development. The CGC identified the key questions and prioritized outcomes for decision making, while the ACP CER at Cochrane Austria assessed efficacy of potentially eligible interventions when compared with placebo and included only efficacious interventions. The CER conducted a supporting systematic review and network meta-analysis on benefits and harms, used a 2-step literature search approach, and searched MEDLINE (Ovid) in February 2023 to detect relevant systematic reviews of placebo-controlled and head-to-head trials of migraine.

### Management of the acute migraine headache [^cb5fbe0d]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

As many as 30 million Americans have migraine headaches. The impact on patients and their families can be tremendous, and treatment of migraines can present diagnostic and therapeutic challenges for family physicians. Abortive treatment options include nonspecific and migraine-specific therapy. Nonspecific therapies include analgesics (aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and opiates), adjunctive therapies (antiemetics and sedatives), and other nonspecific medications (intranasal lidocaine or steroids). Migraine-specific abortive therapies include ergotamine and its derivatives, and triptans. Complementary and alternative therapies can also be used to abort the headache or enhance the efficacy of another therapeutic modality. Treatment choices for acute migraine should be based on headache severity, migraine frequency, associated symptoms, and comorbidities.

### The relative efficacy of meperidine for the treatment of acute migraine: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^11ddd4a4]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Study Objective

Despite guidelines recommending against opioids as first-line treatment for acute migraine, meperidine is the agent used most commonly in North American emergency departments. Clinical trials performed to date have been small and have not arrived at consistent conclusions about the efficacy of meperidine. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the relative efficacy and adverse effect profile of opioids compared with nonopioid active comparators for the treatment of acute migraine.

Methods

We searched multiple sources (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and LILACS, emergency and headache medicine conference proceedings) for randomized controlled trials comparing parenteral opioid and nonopioid active comparators for the treatment of acute migraine headache. Our primary outcome was relief of headache. If this was unavailable, we accepted rescue medication use or we transformed visual analog scale change scores by using an established procedure. We grouped studies by comparator: a regimen containing dihydroergotamine, antiemetic alone, or ketorolac. For each study, we calculated an odds ratio (OR) of headache relief and then assessed clinical and statistical heterogeneity for the group of studies. We then pooled the ORs of headache relief with a random-effects model.

Results

From 899 citations, 19 clinical trials were identified, of which 11 were appropriate and had available data. Four trials involving 254 patients compared meperidine to dihydroergotamine, 4 trials involving 248 patients compared meperidine to an antiemetic, and 3 trials involving 123 patients compared meperidine to ketorolac. Meperidine was less effective than dihydroergotamine at providing headache relief (OR = 0.30; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.09 to 0.97) and trended toward less efficacy than the antiemetics (OR = 0.46; 95% CI 0.19 to 1.11); however, the efficacy of meperidine was similar to that of ketorolac (OR = 1.75; 95% CI 0.84 to 3.61). Compared to dihydroergotamine, meperidine caused more sedation (OR = 3.52; 95% CI 0.87 to 14.19) and dizziness (OR = 8.67; 95% CI 2.66 to 28.23). Compared to the antiemetics, meperidine caused less akathisia (OR = 0.10; 95% CI 0.02 to 0.57). Meperidine and ketorolac use resulted in similar rates of gastrointestinal adverse effects (OR = 1.27; 95% CI 0.31 to 5.15) and sedation (OR = 1.70; 95% CI 0.23 to 12.72).

Conclusion

Clinicians should consider alternatives to meperidine when treating acute migraine with injectable agents.

### Acute treatments for episodic migraine in adults-JAMA network… [^506b0c38]. JAMA Network (2021). Excellent credibility.

According to 7 systematic reviews, triptans compared with placebo were significantly associated with increased pain freedom and pain relief at 2 hours and 1 day, and increased risk of mild and transient adverse events. According to 1 systematic review, the combination of sumatriptan and naproxen compared with placebo was significantly associated with improved pain freedom and pain relief at 2 hours, sustained pain freedom and sustained pain relief at 1 day, and improved function at 2 hours.

Compared with placebo, rimegepant and ubrogepant were associated with significant improvement in pain freedom and pain relief at 2 hours and sustained pain freedom at 1 day and at 1 week. Ubrogepant was associated with significantly more adverse events related to ear, nose, and throat symptoms. The results of the meta-analyses of the pain and function outcomes are summarized in Figure 2. Compared with placebo, chlorpromazine was associated with significantly more pain freedom and pain relief at 2 hours and 1 day; prochlorperazine and droperidol.

Compared with placebo, dihydroergotamine was associated with significantly more pain freedom and pain relief at 2 hours, 1 day, and 1 week, sustained pain freedom and pain relief at 1 day and 1 week, and gastrointestinal adverse events. Compared with placebo, ergotamine plus caffeine was associated with significantly more pain relief at 2 hours. The results of meta-analyses of pain and function outcomes and adverse events for the ergot alkaloid drugs are summarized in eFigures 3 and 4 and eTable 9. 4, respectively, in the Supplement.

### Pharmacologic treatments of acute episodic migraine headache in outpatient settings: a clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians [^2f93b83d]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

American College of Physicians guideline — outpatient treatment of acute episodic migraine: Recommendation 1: ACP recommends that clinicians add a triptan to a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug to treat moderate to severe acute episodic migraine headache in outpatient settings for nonpregnant adults who do not respond adequately to a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (strong recommendation; moderate-certainty evidence). Recommendation 2: ACP suggests that clinicians add a triptan to acetaminophen to treat moderate to severe acute episodic migraine headache in outpatient settings for nonpregnant adults who do not respond adequately to acetaminophen (conditional recommendation; low-certainty evidence). Supporting evidence notes that combination therapy of a triptan (sumatriptan) and an NSAID (naproxen), compared with triptan monotherapy, resulted in a higher likelihood of sustained pain relief up to 48 hours after initial treatment (130 more events per 1000 treated people) and lower likelihood of using rescue medication at 24 hours (130 fewer events per 1000 treated people).

### Updated evaluation of IV dihydroergotamine (DHE) for refractory migraine: patient selection and special considerations [^7735b447]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Emergency Departments and Urgent Care Centers

Patients who do not have adequate at-home treatment options lack access to outpatient infusion centers, or who have intractable nausea and vomiting may present to an emergency department (ED) or urgent care center (UCC) for treatment. There have been few strong studies of DHE use in the EDand none in the UCC setting. In one class 3 study in the ED, patients were randomized to DHE 1 mg SC or sumatriptan 5 mg SC. The outcome favored sumatriptan at 1 and 2 hours though not at 3 hours, suggesting a more durable effect of DHE at aborting a migraine attack. Due to the lack of rigorous studies, however, the use of IV DHE in the ED setting does not garner a strong recommendation. Despite this, it is used commonly in many EDs and UCCs, often as part of a "migraine cocktail" incorporating antiemetic and anti-inflammatory drugs. Further study is warranted to establish best practices with DHE under these circumstances.

Inpatient

Certain populations of patients benefit from inpatient admission for the management of migraine. Among them include patients with status migrainosus, dehydration or intractable nausea/vomiting, dependence on opioids or barbiturates requiring detoxification, medical disease requiring careful observation, outpatient treatment failure, frequent ED visits, and those requiring comprehensive medical or psychiatric co-management.

For patients with a longstanding history of refractory migraine, inpatient treatment improves pain and disability and reduces analgesic overuse. Multiple drugs can be used in the inpatient setting along with DHE to enhance its effects, manage other symptoms of migraine, and mitigate adverse events. Inpatient use was first described by Raskin, in which 55 patients with continuous headache, most of whom were overusing acute medications, received IV DHE at a dose between 0.3 mg and 1 mg every 8 hours for 2 days. At the end of treatment, 89% of patients were headache-free with most reporting lasting benefit.

### Does the addition of dexamethasone to standard therapy for acute migraine headache decrease the incidence of recurrent headache for patients treated in the emergency department? A meta-analysis and systematic review of the literature [^d1fce4a7]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

Neurogenic inflammation is thought to play a role in the development and perpetuation of migraine headache. The emergency department (ED) administration of dexamethasone in addition to standard antimigraine therapy has been used to decrease the incidence of recurrent headaches at 24 to 72 hours following evaluation. This systematic review details the completed trials that have evaluated the use of dexamethasone in this role.

Methods

The authors searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, LILACS, recent emergency medicine scientific abstracts, and several prepublication trial registries for potential investigations related to the research question. The authors included studies that incorporated randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled methodology and that were performed in the ED. A fixed-effects and random-effects model was used to obtain summary risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the self-reported outcome of moderate or severe headache on follow-up evaluation.

Results

A pooled analysis of seven trials involving 742 patients suggests a modest but significant benefit when dexamethasone is added to standard antimigraine therapy to reduce the rate of patients with moderate or severe headache on 24- to 72-hour follow-up evaluation (RR = 0.87, 95% CI = 0.80 to 0.95; absolute risk reduction = 9.7%). The treatment of 1,000 patients with acute migraine headache using dexamethasone in addition to standard antimigraine therapy would be expected to prevent 97 patients from experiencing the outcome of moderate or severe headache at 24 to 72 hours after ED evaluation. The sensitivity analysis yielded similar results with sequential trial elimination, indicating that no single trial was responsible for the overall result. Adverse effects related to the administration of a single dose of dexamethasone were infrequent, mild, and transient.

Conclusions

These results suggest that dexamethasone is efficacious in preventing headache recurrence and safe when added to standard treatment for the management of acute migraine headache in the ED.

### Acute migraine management in children [^20c0341b]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2015). Low credibility.

Migraines are common, incapacitating, and often stress inducing for pediatric patients and parents alike. According to the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, more than 1 million Americans seek emergency care every year due to migraines, with increasing frequency among adolescents. The disease can vary in severity and character, often mimicking life-threatening conditions, requiring prompt nuanced recognition by emergency personnel and implementation of an effective treatment strategy. Development of emergency department guidelines for the management of pediatric migraines should be based on up-to-date evidence supporting safe, appropriate therapies for children.

### Practice guideline update summary: acute treatment of migraine in children and adolescents: report of the guideline development, dissemination, and implementation subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology and the American Headache Society [^9929d204]. Neurology (2019). High credibility.

Acute migraine management in children and adolescents — many children and adolescents do not respond to treatment at home with NSAIDs and triptans and seek pain relief at an emergency department or infusion center. Trials of refractory headache treatment in children and adolescents have been conducted but therapeutic approaches in these circumstances vary. Studies are also needed of alternate delivery routes for acute treatments such as transdermal patches because oral medications are poorly absorbed in children and adolescents with nausea and vomiting. Regardless of the strategy chosen for acute migraine therapy, treatment plans should be individually tailored to the patient and family and include education about migraine prevention strategies.

### Treatment of acute migraine headache [^5f7800c8]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Migraine headache is a common and potentially debilitating disorder often treated by family physicians. Before diagnosing migraine, serious intracranial pathology must be ruled out. Treating acute migraine is challenging because of substantial rates of nonresponse to medications and difficulty in predicting individual response to a specific agent or dose. Data comparing different drug classes are relatively scarce. Abortive therapy should be used as early as possible after the onset of symptoms. Effective first-line therapies for mild to moderate migraine are nonprescription nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and combination analgesics containing acetaminophen, aspirin, and caffeine. Triptans are first-line therapies for moderate to severe migraine, or mild to moderate migraine that has not responded to adequate doses of simple analgesics. Triptans should be avoided in patients with vascular disease, uncontrolled hypertension, or hemiplegic migraine. Intravenous antiemetics, with or without intravenous dihydroergotamine, are effective therapies in an emergency department setting. Dexamethasone may be a useful adjunct to standard therapy in preventing short-term headache recurrence. Intranasal lidocaine may also have a role in relief of acute migraine. Isometheptene-containing compounds and intranasal dihydroergotamine are also reasonable therapeutic options. Medications containing opiates or barbiturates should be avoided for acute migraine. During pregnancy, migraine may be treated with acetaminophen or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (prior to third trimester), or opiates in refractory cases. Acetaminophen, ibuprofen, intranasal sumatriptan, and intranasal zolmitriptan seem to be effective in children and adolescents, although data in these age groups are limited.

1.2.2. Placebo control

Recommendations:

1.2.2.1. Interventions under evaluation for the acute treatment of migraine should be compared with placebo.

1.2.2.2. When two presumably active treatments are compared, a placebo control should be included for assay sensitivity.

Comments:

The placebo effect is a genuine psychobiological phenomenon that affects the results of clinical trials across different disease states. In trials for the acute treatment of migraine placebo response varies widely, from 6% to 56% for headache relief and from 6% to 25% for pain freedom. This variability makes it difficult to interpret the results of active comparator trials that do not include placebo. Trials using historical controls or active comparators lack assay sensitivity and require large sample sizes to provide the narrow confidence intervals (CIs) needed to ensure that new drugs are not inferior to controls.

In the past, modified designs (e.g. exclusion of placebo responders or sequential parallel designs) to reduce placebo response have proved poorly effective. Nonetheless, particular care should be dedicated to identify and mitigate placebo response risks as much as possible.

### Acute migraine therapy: recent evidence from randomized comparative trials [^a7e09010]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

(1) A wide array of data regarding acute migraine treatment are available, but few trials strictly adhere to International Headache Society guidelines for patient inclusion criteria.(2) Triptans appear to have similar efficacy profiles, but among newer triptans, almotriptan offers improved tolerability over sumatriptan.(3) Combination indomethacin/caffeine/prochlorperazine most likely has similar therapeutic efficacy to triptan therapy, with further research needed to complete understanding of any potential differences between these treatments.(4) Multi-targeted combination therapy with a triptan plus a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID), such as sumatriptan/naproxen sodium, is more effective in acute migraine treatment than monotherapy with either agent alone.(5) It is unclear whether triptans offer clinically relevant benefits over aspirin or NSAIDs in migraine patients. Thus NSAIDs, particularly effervescent aspirin, should be considered the first-line treatment of migraine attacks.

### A comparison of acute treatment regimens for migraine in the emergency department [^8ba7dd3c]. Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Migraine headache is a common pediatric complaint among emergency department (ED) patients. There are limited trials on abortive therapies in the ED. The objective of this study was to apply a comparative effectiveness approach to investigate acute medication regimens for the prevention of ED revisits.

Methods

Retrospective study using administrative data (Pediatric Health Information System) from 35 pediatric EDs (2009–2012). Children aged 7 to 18 years with a principal diagnosis of migraine headache were studied. The primary outcome was a revisit to the ED within 3 days for discharged patients. The primary analysis compared the treatment regimens and individual medications on the risk for revisit.

Results

The study identified 32,124 children with migraine; 27,317 (85%) were discharged, and 5.5% had a return ED visit within 3 days. At the index visit, the most common medications included nonopioid analgesics (66%), dopamine antagonists (50%), diphenhydramine (33%), and ondansetron (21%). Triptans and opiate medications were administered infrequently (3% each). Children receiving metoclopramide had a 31% increased odds for an ED revisit within 3 days compared with prochlorperazine. Diphenhydramine with dopamine antagonists was associated with 27% increased odds of an ED revisit compared with dopamine antagonists alone. Children receiving ondansetron had similar revisit rates to those receiving dopamine antagonists.

Conclusions

The majority of children with migraines are successfully discharged from the ED and only 1 in 18 required a revisit within 3 days. Prochlorperazine appears to be superior to metoclopramide in preventing a revisit, and diphenhydramine use is associated with increased rates of return.

2.2.2. Endpoints

The primary efficacy endpoint in early intervention trials should be pain-free at 2 hours after treatment. However, as the aim of early intervention trials is also to evaluate efficacy on pain progression, sustained pain-free to 24 or 48 hours (refer to Section 1.3.4.2) should be used as a co-primary endpoint. The number of protocol violators (subjects assigned to treat mild headache who treat moderate-severe and vice versa) in early intervention trials can be substantial. As protocol violators, these subjects can be excluded from the ITT analysis, but there is a risk that analysis of the smaller sample will not be sufficiently powered to detect treatment effects. An acceptable alternative is to reassign these subjects to their actual treatment groups, as long as the re-allocation is done before the blind is broken.

1.2.10. Number of attacks treated

Recommendations:

1.2.10.1. Determining the effect of an acute treatment on the first migraine attack should be the primary objective. The attack to be considered should be clearly specified in the protocol.

1.2.10.2. If multiple attacks are treated, the first treated attack or the attack that will be considered for assessing the primary objective can be randomly selected.

Comments:

In most clinical trials of acute treatment, the first treated attack will be used in the evaluation of efficacy. Refer to Section 1.2.12 for information about multiple-attack trials addressing consistency of response as a primary objective.

1.2.11. Rescue medication

Recommendations:

1.2.11.1. The use of rescue medication should be allowed at any time after the first primary efficacy time point, typically 2 hours after the initial administration of treatment.

1.2.11.2. Use of rescue medication before the 2-hour endpoint should be considered a treatment failure unless an earlier time point for rescue was pre-specified in the trial protocol.

Comments:

The time interval to using rescue medication can be reduced when the primary efficacy time point is before 2 hours, which is often the case in assessments of parenteral drugs or trials involving paediatric subjects. Little can be learned from delaying rescue medications beyond the primary efficacy time point. Furthermore, delays may unduly discomfort subjects and prolong the attack and associated disability, which are ethically unacceptable. Rescue medication can be taken before the time of the primary endpoint if subjects require it, but such use should be recorded as a treatment failure.

Pediatric migraine — treatment sequencing and route selection: Clinicians should counsel patients and families that a series of medications may need to be used to find treatments that most benefit the patient (Level B), should instruct patients and families to use the medication that best treats the characteristics of each migraine to provide the best balance of efficacy, side effects, and patient preference (Level B), and should offer an alternate triptan, if 1 triptan fails to provide pain relief, to find the most effective agent to reduce migraine symptoms (Level B). Clinicians may prescribe a nonoral route when headache peaks in severity quickly, is accompanied by nausea or vomiting, or oral formulations fail to provide pain relief (Level C), and clinicians should counsel patients and families that if their headache is successfully treated by their acute migraine medication but headache recurs within 24 hours of their initial treatment, taking a second dose of acute migraine medication can treat the recurrent headache (Level B).

ED migraine treatment — prochlorperazine plus diphenhydramine versus hydromorphone: In a randomized double-blind study in 2 EDs, eligible adults ≥ 21 y with moderate or severe migraine and no opioid use in the last month were randomized in blocks of 4 to hydromorphone 1 mg or prochlorperazine 10 mg plus diphenhydramine 25 mg; the primary outcome was sustained headache relief, defined as achieving a headache level of mild or none within 2 h of medication administration and maintaining that level for 48 h without the requirement of rescue medication. The trial was halted by the data monitoring committee after enrollment of 127 patients; sustained relief occurred in the prochlorperazine arm by 37 of 62 (60%) versus in the hydromorphone arm by 20 of 64 (31%) (difference 28%, 95% CI 12% to 45%; NNT 4, 95% CI 2% to 9%). Potential for selection bias is noted due to uncontrolled confounders including severity of the underlying headache disorder, concomitant medication-overuse headache, and baseline opioid use.

American College of Physicians (ACP) guideline key questions — acute episodic migraine pharmacologic treatment focuses on six key questions: comparative benefits and harms of initial pharmacologic treatments in adult patients with acute attacks of episodic migraine; comparative benefits and harms of second-step pharmacologic treatments for patients who did not achieve adequate relief with an initial pharmacologic treatment attempt for an acute migraine attack; patients' values and preferences regarding initial pharmacologic treatments; patients' values and preferences regarding second-step pharmacologic treatments; cost-effectiveness of initial pharmacologic treatments in adult patients; and cost-effectiveness of second-step pharmacologic treatments in patients who did not achieve adequate relief with an initial attempt. Across these, variation by demographic characteristics (age, sex, gender, race/ethnicity) and by the presence of menstrual or menstrual (cyclical) migraine is explicitly queried for benefits/harms and for outcomes.

### Sumatriptan plus naproxen for acute migraine attacks in adults [^8298ca83]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Migraine is a common disabling condition and a burden for the individual, health services, and society. Effective abortive treatments include the triptan and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory classes of drugs. These drugs have different mechanisms of action and combining them may provide better relief. Sumatriptan plus naproxen is now available in combination form for the acute treatment of migraine.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy and tolerability of sumatriptan plus naproxen (administered together as separate tablets or taken as a fixed-dose combination tablet) compared with placebo and other active interventions for the acute treatment of migraine headaches in adults.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) on The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, together with two online databases (www.gsk-clinicalstudyregister.com and www.clinicaltrials.gov) for studies to 2 August 2013. We also searched the reference list of included studies and relevant reviews.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised, double-blind, placebo- or active-controlled studies, with at least 10 participants per treatment arm, using sumatriptan plus naproxen to treat a migraine headache episode.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We used numbers of participants achieving each outcome to calculate risk ratio and numbers needed to treat to benefit (NNT) or harm (NNH) compared with placebo or a different active treatment.

Main Results

We included 12 studies using sumatriptan 85 mg or 50 mg plus naproxen 500 mg to treat attacks of mild, moderate, or severe pain intensity: 3663 participants received combination treatment, 3682 placebo, 964 sumatriptan, and 982 naproxen. No studies were considered to be at high risk of bias for any of the criteria evaluated. Overall, the combination was better than placebo for pain-free and headache relief responses. At two hours, the NNT for pain-free response was 3.1 when the baseline pain was mild (50% response with sumatriptan plus naproxen compared with 18% with placebo), and 4.9 when baseline pain was moderate or severe (28% with sumatriptan plus naproxen compared with 8% with placebo) (RR 3.65 (95% CI 3.0 to 4.5); high quality evidence). Using 50 mg of sumatriptan, rather than 85 mg, in the combination did not significantly change the result. Treating early, when pain was still mild, was significantly better than treating once pain was moderate or severe for pain-free responses at two hours and during the 24 hours post dose. Adverse events were mostly mild or moderate in severity and rarely led to withdrawal; they were more common with the combination than with placebo. Where the data allowed direct comparison, combination treatment was superior to either monotherapy, but adverse events were less frequent with naproxen than sumatriptan.

Authors' Conclusions

Combination treatment was effective in the acute treatment of migraine headaches. The effect was greater than for the same dose of either sumatriptan or naproxen alone, but additional benefits over sumatriptan alone are not large. More participants achieved good relief when medication was taken early in the attack, when pain was still mild. Adverse events were more common with the combination and sumatriptan alone than with placebo or naproxen alone.

### Ibuprofen with or without an antiemetic for acute migraine headaches in adults [^eb84ba89]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

This is an updated version of the original review published in Issue 10, 2010 (Rabbie 2010). Migraine is a common, disabling condition and a burden for the individual, health services and society. Many sufferers do not seek professional help, relying instead on over-the-counter analgesics. Co-therapy with an antiemetic should help to reduce symptoms commonly associated with migraine headaches.

Objectives

To determine efficacy and tolerability of ibuprofen, alone or in combination with an antiemetic, compared to placebo and other active interventions in the treatment of acute migraine headaches in adults.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Oxford Pain Relief Database, ClinicalTrials.gov, and reference lists for studies through 22 April 2010 for the original review and to 14 February 2013 for the update.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised, double-blind, placebo- or active-controlled studies using self-administered ibuprofen to treat a migraine headache episode, with at least 10 participants per treatment arm.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Numbers of participants achieving each outcome were used to calculate relative risk and number needed to treat (NNT) or harm (NNH) compared to placebo or other active treatment.

Main Results

No new studies were found for this update. Nine included studies (4373 participants, 5223 attacks) compared ibuprofen with placebo or other active comparators; none combined ibuprofen with a self-administered antiemetic. All studies treated attacks with single doses of medication. For ibuprofen 400 mg versus placebo, NNTs for 2-hour pain-free (26% versus 12% with placebo), 2-hour headache relief (57% versus 25%) and 24-hour sustained headache relief (45% versus 19%) were 7.2, 3.2 and 4.0, respectively. For ibuprofen 200 mg versus placebo, NNTs for 2-hour pain-free (20% versus 10%) and 2-hour headache relief (52% versus 37%) were 9.7 and 6.3, respectively. The higher dose was significantly better than the lower dose for 2-hour headache relief. Soluble formulations of ibuprofen 400 mg were better than standard tablets for 1-hour, but not 2-hour headache relief. Similar numbers of participants experienced adverse events, which were mostly mild and transient, with ibuprofen and placebo. Ibuprofen 400 mg did not differ from rofecoxib 25 mg for 2-hour headache relief or 24-hour headache relief.

Authors' Conclusions

We found no new studies since the last version of this review. Ibuprofen is an effective treatment for acute migraine headaches, providing pain relief in about half of sufferers, but complete relief from pain and associated symptoms for only a minority. NNTs for all efficacy outcomes were better with 400 mg than 200 mg in comparisons with placebo, and soluble formulations provided more rapid relief. Adverse events were mostly mild and transient, occurring at the same rate as with placebo.

1.3.4.5. Headache relief

Recommendations:

1.3.4.5.1. Headache relief, defined as the decrease in headache pain from moderate or severe at baseline to mild or none at 2 hours after treatment and before taking any rescue medication (refer to Section 1.2.11), should be used as a secondary efficacy measure.

1.3.4.5.2. A time point before 2 hours after treatment can be used when testing parenteral treatments.

Comments:

Headache relief should be used as an outcome measure, but only as a secondary endpoint and mainly to facilitate comparison of the results of new clinical trials with those of previous programmes Since headache relief is associated with relief of disability, it can be used in clinical trials as a proxy for pain improvement and restoration of function. Headache relief is also useful for comprehensive cost of treatment analyses.

In older acute migraine clinical trials, headache relief at 2 hours after treatment was used extensively as a primary efficacy outcome based on the suggestion that patients may consider an acute treatment effective while residual headache pain persists. The validity of this argument has been challenged by evidence showing that patients do not believe a reduction in headache pain from moderate to mild constitutes success and expect acute treatment to provide freedom from pain. In addition, the headache relief endpoint assumes that the magnitude of change from severe pain to no pain is clinically equivalent to the change from moderate pain to mild pain, which is not the case. Finally, the verbal rating of pain intensity as 0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, and 3 = severe assumes it is an interval variable in the absence of clinical validation.

1.3.4.6. Time to meaningful relief

Recommendation:

Time to meaningful relief can be used as a secondary efficacy measure.

Comments:

Time to meaningful relief is most often assessed by subjects using electronic diaries with time-stamp capabilities, which have largely replaced the use of stopwatches. The time-stamped information improves the precision of time estimates relative to the fixed-interval assessments once commonly used in migraine trials by providing data about treatment response over a clinically relevant period of time instead of at pre-specified time points (e.g. 1, 2, or 4 hours after treatment). Time stamping also allows diary entries for time to meaningful relief to be analysed by powerful statistical methods, such as survival analysis, that are superior to analyses based on fixed intervals.

The quality of clinical trials is an essential part of the evidence base for the treatment of headache disorders. In 1991, the International Headache Society Clinical Trials Standing Committee developed and published the first edition of the Guidelines for controlled trials of drugs in migraine. Scientific and clinical developments in headache medicine led to second and third editions in 2000 and 2012, respectively. The current, fourth edition of the Guidelines retains the structure and much content from previous editions. However, it also incorporates evidence from clinical trials published after the third edition as well as feedback from meetings with regulators, pharmaceutical and device manufacturers, and patient associations. Its final form reflects the collective expertise and judgement of the Committee. These updated recommendations and commentary are intended to meet the Society's continuing objective of providing a contemporary, standardized, and evidence-based approach to the conduct and reporting of randomised controlled trials for the acute treatment of migraine attacks.

Emergency department (ED) acute primary headache management — evidence synthesis identified 3 class II and 10 class III studies, and in conjunction with direct and indirect comparison studies there is clear and overwhelming evidence to support the use of nonopioid management. Given the well-documented complications associated with opioid management, nonopioids are strongly preferred in the management of acute primary headache, including migraines, in the ED, and as a result, the use of opioids should be discouraged; to ensure sustained relief from post-ED recurrence, providers should consider discharge medication and education, and oral sumatriptan and naproxen are both proven medications that deliver relief in the first 48 hours post-ED discharge.

### Emergent management of primary headache: a review of current literature [^d7139598]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The current article reviews recent data on treatment of acute headache patients in the acute care setting.

Recent Findings

Intravenous fluid hydration, a common component of emergency department (ED) migraine therapy, does not improve pain outcomes and leads to longer ED lengths of stay. Therefore, intravenous fluids should be administered only to migraine patients with clinical evidence of dehydration. Similarly, intravenous ketamine has garnered interest as a treatment for acute pain but does not provide substantial relief to migraine patients. New studies on the serotonin (5-HT3; 5-hydroxytryptamine-3) antagonist granisetron, intranasal lidocaine, and high-flow oxygen have reported conflicting results for migraine patients. Finally, although experts recommend avoiding opioids in migraine treatment, opioid administration remains prevalent in the ED. A new study has demonstrated that patients who receive intravenous hydromorphone in the ED are much less likely to attain acute headache relief. Standardized headache protocols may decrease opioid use and provide significant pain relief for patients.

Summary

Recent data have clarified the role of opioids and ketamine in the ED (do not use!). The role of treatment protocols and intravenous fluids is still ill-defined. Subpopulations of migraine patients may benefit from high-flow oxygen and intranasal lidocaine.

### Parenteral metoclopramide for acute migraine: meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^3c872593]. BMJ (2004). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To assess the evidence from controlled trials on the efficacy and tolerability of parenteral metoclopramide for acute migraine in adults.

Data Sources

Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Medline, Embase, LILACS, CINAHL, conference proceedings, clinical practice guidelines, and other sources.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of parenteral metoclopramide for acute migraine in adults.

Results

We reviewed 596 potentially relevant abstracts and found 13 eligible trials totalling 655 adults. In studies comparing metoclopramide with placebo, metoclopramide was more likely to provide significant reduction in migraine pain (odds ratio 2.84, 95% confidence interval 1.05 to 7.68). Used as the only agent, metoclopramide showed mixed effectiveness when compared with other single agents. Heterogeneity of studies for combination treatment prevented statistical pooling. Treatments that did include metoclopramide were as, or more, effective than comparison treatments for pain, nausea, and relapse outcomes reported in all studies.

Conclusions

Metoclopramide is an effective treatment for migraine headache and may be effective when combined with other treatments. Given its non-narcotic and antiemetic properties, metoclopramide should be considered a primary agent in the treatment of acute migraines in emergency departments.

Additional challenges hindering clinical trials for the acute treatment of aura include the low incidence and relatively short duration of aura, together with the high inter-individual variability of aura characteristics. The adoption of alternative trial designs may help to overcome these challenges and the consequent lack of specific treatments for migraine-associated aura. As a first step, the trial protocol should clearly state if the objective is to abort or reduce the length of the aura or to reduce or eliminate the headache, as these are distinct outcomes that most likely have different neurobiologies. It should also specify that participants have a history of at least one aura or attack of migraine with aura per month. In trials where the expected effect of treatment is to prevent the headache phase, the primary efficacy endpoint should be the number of headaches following the aura, with pain freedom after 2 hours a secondary efficacy measure. When the focus is on headache prevention in migraine with aura, a feasible compromise can be aura followed by headache in at least 80% of the attacks. In trials where aura is the event of interest, the primary efficacy measure should be the duration of the aura.

2.2. Early intervention

To facilitate migraine diagnosis and assess whether acute treatment will be effective when headache intensity is moderate or severe, subjects in clinical trials are often required to wait until headache pain is of at least moderate intensity before they treat an attack. This is not how migraine attacks are treated in clinical practice, where early intervention may be the most effective acute treatment strategy. With many oral triptans, for example, early intervention has been shown to lead to a higher percentage of pain-free responses at 2 hours after treatment than traditional administration (i.e. when headache intensity is moderate or severe): 57% versus 43% for zolmitriptan 2.5 mg, 68% versus 47% for eletriptan, 53% versus 38% for almotriptan 12.5 mg, 58% versus 32% for sumatriptan 100 mg, and 66% versus 44% for rizatriptan 10 mg). Early treatment while pain is mild has been associated with higher pain free rates for non-triptan acute treatments as well.

1.2.5. Stratification

Recommendations:

1.2.5.1. There is usually no need for stratification in acute treatment trials.

1.2.5.2. Stratification may be considered when an imbalance between the treatment groups or an important factor may influence the results of a trial.

Comments:

Randomization alone may not ensure full comparability between subjects in different treatment groups, especially in smaller trials, and stratified randomization is sometimes used to circumvent potential imbalances. The EMA recommends that stratification variables usually be included as covariates in primary analyses, regardless of their prognostic value. In controlled trials for migraine, the use of stratification by prognostic factors should be limited to a few variables and only to those that have historically demonstrated effects on primary efficacy endpoint(s). Stratification variables that have been used in acute treatment trials include age, body weight, headache intensity at baseline, migraine type (i.e. with or without aura), menstrual versus non-menstrual attacks, and concomitant preventive treatment. Given the preponderance of females with migraine, sex may also be used as a stratification factor to control for imbalances in treatment groups.

1.2.6. Intention to treat

Recommendations:

1.2.6.1. Randomized controlled trials of acute treatments for migraine should follow the principle of intention to treat (ITT), which implies that analyses should include all randomised subjects in the groups to which they were randomly assigned, regardless of treatment received.

1.2.6.2. The full analysis set may be modified to exclude subjects from the analysis if no treatment was taken or if no data points after treatment were recorded. A plan should be provided prospectively as to how participants missing the 2-hour endpoint or who treat but do not record data will be handled. Those who treat but do not record data should probably be counted as failures, and those who use rescue medication before the 2-hour time assessment should be counted as failures.

Comments:

The ITT principle encourages, where reasonable, the inclusion of subjects who withdrew, were lost to follow-up, or did not fully adhere to trial protocol. The ITT principle should be adhered to when the primary outcome is a variable that measures a change from baseline to any post-dose time point or to the end of the trial. When the primary outcome is defined as a rate of change, and the analysis will therefore imply a slope or rate of calculation, only subjects who have received at least one dose and recorded at least one data point should be included.

### Pharmacologic treatments of acute episodic migraine headache in outpatient settings: a clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians [^98dfddf7]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Clinical considerations — pharmacologic choices and sequencing emphasize initiating or optimizing simple analgesics and considering additional options: consider treating mild episodic migraine headache with an nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), acetaminophen, or the combination of an NSAID and acetaminophen; ask about prior use and ensure appropriate dosing, considering increasing the dosage without exceeding the recommended maximum daily dose if relief is inadequate; patients who do not tolerate or have inadequate response to a recommended treatment may respond to another within the same drug class; although comparative effectiveness data were uncertain, there is evidence supporting efficacy for CGRP antagonists-gepants (rimegepant, ubrogepant, or zavegepant) or ergot alkaloid (dihydroergotamine); consider using the ditan lasmiditan in nonpregnant outpatient adults who do not tolerate or have inadequate response to all other pharmacologic treatments included in this guideline; consider using a nonoral triptan and an antiemetic in people having severe nausea or vomiting; and do not use opioids or butalbital for acute episodic migraine.

### Randomized trial of IV dexamethasone for acute migraine in the emergency department [^a3a053b7]. Neurology (2007). Low credibility.

Background

It is not yet clear if corticosteroids are useful for the treatment of migraine. We determined the efficacy of 10 mg of IV dexamethasone as adjuvant therapy for patients presenting to an emergency department (ED) with acute migraine.

Methods

This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter trial. Subjects were randomized to dexamethasone 10 mg IV or placebo. As primary treatment for their migraine, all subjects received IV metoclopramide. Our primary hypotheses were the following: a greater percentage of patients with migraine who received dexamethasone would 1) achieve a headache-free state in the ED and maintain it for 24 hours and 2) have no headache-related functional impairment after ED discharge when compared to placebo.

Results

A total of 656 patients were approached for participation and 205 were randomized. The persistent pain-free outcome was achieved in 25% of those randomized to dexamethasone and 19% of placebo (p = 0.34). No functional impairment after ED discharge occurred in 67% of those randomized to dexamethasone and 59% of placebo (p = 0.20). In the subgroup of subjects with migraine lasting longer than 72 hours, 38% of those randomized to dexamethasone were persistently pain-free vs 13% of placebo (p = 0.06). Side effect profiles were similar, with the exception of acute medication reactions, which occurred more commonly in the dexamethasone group.

Conclusion

A moderate dose of IV dexamethasone should not be administered routinely for the emergency department-based treatment of acute migraine, although it might be useful for patients with migraine lasting longer than 72 hours.

2.2.1. Design

Early intervention trials were once characterized by wide variations in methodology and design and important differences in the definition of an early intervention. As the time of treatment (how soon after onset treatment is taken) and headache intensity (treatment is taken when pain is mild) are not necessarily interchangeable, early intervention should be defined as the administration of treatment when pain intensity is mild and within 1 hour of headache onset. By this definition, individuals with headaches predominantly occurring at night or on waking in the morning, as well as those who experience more than one headache type and who are not able to differentiate migraine from other headaches, should be excluded from early intervention trials.

The specifics of an early intervention design depend on the purpose of the trial. If its objective is to show that a drug is more effective than placebo when treating early in the mild phase, then a traditional parallel-group comparison or crossover design can be used (refer to Section 1.2.3 for more information about design types). However, if its objective is to show that early treatment (when pain is mild) is more effective than late treatment (when pain is moderate/severe), the theoretically ideal design would be a multiple crossover trial in which the same subject treats four attacks (early intervention with placebo, early intervention with active, late intervention with placebo, and late intervention with active) in randomized order. Because a trial using this design would be complex, an acceptable option would be a design used by Goadsby et al. in which subjects in four parallel arms (early intervention with placebo, early intervention with active, late intervention with placebo, and late intervention with active) treat a single attack. Another suitable alternative would utilize a two-arm parallel design, with treatment arms allocated to early intervention and late intervention, and subjects treating two attacks (one with placebo and one with active) in a randomized order.

Comparative effectiveness rationale — net benefit and adverse events: Comparative effectiveness evidence showed that the combination of a triptan (sumatriptan) and an NSAID (naproxen) had the greatest net benefit, with a larger net benefit than monotherapy with a triptan, an NSAID, acetaminophen, or a CGRP antagonist-gepant. The combination of a triptan (rizatriptan) and acetaminophen had a similar net benefit to triptan monotherapy and showed a greater net benefit than acetaminophen. The CGC determined that triptans are associated with more AEs than NSAIDs and acetaminophen, although these AEs are generally mild (for example, fatigue, dizziness, and nausea), and that "some pain relief" may be more important than "absence of pain".

### Randomized clinical trial of intravenous magnesium sulfate as an adjunctive medication for emergency department treatment of migraine headache [^71953e9a]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Study Objective

We test the hypothesis that intravenous magnesium sulfate is an effective adjunctive medication for treatment of acute migraine.

Methods

In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, adults presenting to 2 urban emergency departments with headache meeting International Headache Society criteria for acute migraine received either 20 mg of intravenous metoclopramide plus 2 g of intravenous magnesium sulfate or 20 mg of intravenous metoclopramide plus a placebo of intravenous saline solution at 15-minute intervals for a maximum of 3 doses or until pain relief occurred. At 0, 15, 30, and 45 minutes, patients recorded pain intensity using a standard visual analog scale (VAS). The primary study end point was the between-group difference in pain improvement when initial and final VAS scores were compared.

Results

Of 44 patients enrolled (21 randomized to metoclopramide plus magnesium and 23 to metoclopramide plus placebo), 42 (95%) were women. Baseline features were comparable in both groups. Each group experienced a more than 50-mm improvement in VAS score during the study. However, this improvement was smaller in the magnesium group for the primary end point (16-mm difference favoring placebo [95% confidence interval (CI) -2 to 34 mm]), as was the proportion with normal functional status at their final rating (36% absolute difference also favoring placebo [95% CI 7% to 65%]). Using a 50% reduction in pain to dichotomize VAS scores, the number needed to harm with magnesium plus metoclopramide versus metoclopramide alone is 4 patients (95% CI 2 to 36).

Conclusion

Although this result was unexpected, our data suggest that the addition of magnesium to metoclopramide may attenuate the effectiveness of metoclopramide in relieving migraine. Countertherapeutic cerebral vasodilatation caused by magnesium is a plausible, although unproven, explanation for this finding. Because of the preponderance of women in our trial, these data may not be generalizable to men.

1.2.12. Consistency of response

Recommendations:

1.2.12.1. Intra-individual consistency of response may be evaluated over multiple attacks in double-blind, placebo-controlled trials.

1.2.12.2. Response to at least four attacks should be assessed, and at least one of the four attacks should be treated with placebo in a randomized fashion.

Comments:

Population-level consistency of response refers to the proportion of treated subjects who achieve a trial endpoint for the first, second, third, or n th treated attack. This is best assessed in randomized controlled trials evaluating multiple attacks (≥ 4) using any of the following three designs. In the first design, all subjects use active treatment for at least three attacks, with placebo in one additional attack, in a randomized order. The second design administers the active treatment for all attacks in most subjects, while a subset uses both active treatment and placebo in a randomized manner for at least four attacks. The third design uses a combined approach, with an initial 1-month double-blind phase (subjects use active treatment or placebo for the first attack) followed by a 1- or 2-month open-label phase, during which subjects treat at least three attacks with the active intervention.

Testing the effect of an acute treatment on several migraine attacks may increase the discriminative power for efficacy when outcome measures are averaged across multiple attacks for each subject, provided that all analysed subjects treat the same number of attacks. Using a generalized estimating equation or random-effects modelling, all treated attacks can be used as a basis for comparison. Generalized estimating equations control for intra-individual correlation, whereas random-effects models treat each individual as a random effect. However, the increase in analytic power can be counterbalanced by a decrease in the number of subjects completing the trial. Relative to single-attack trials, multiple attack trials have higher dropout rates and may introduce an unmanageable bias if dropouts are related to tolerability issues or lack of efficacy. Furthermore, repeated intake of placebo when a standard treatment is available raises ethical issues.

Assessing intra-individual and population-level consistency of response has been difficult in long-term safety trials because they rarely include a placebo control and often introduce selection bias when responders from an efficacy trial are carried over. Long-term trials should be used to evaluate the development of tolerance (tachyphylaxis).

### Improving acute treatment of pediatric primary headache disorders with a novel headache treatment center: retrospective review of preliminary outcomes [^31f210dd]. Journal of Child Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To determine preliminary outcomes of targeted headache treatments provided at a novel outpatient acute care pediatric headache treatment center.

Background

Limitations exist in acute management of pediatric headaches, including inadequate access to specialty headache therapies and headache specialists in acute settings, variable success of emergency room treatments, and omission of comfort measures. An outpatient acute headache care clinic (the "Headache Treatment Center") was strategically initiated at a Midwestern pediatric academic hospital to provide acute and targeted headache therapies for children with active headaches.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective chart review of 154 visits from September through November 2018 of patients ages 7–18 years visiting the Headache Treatment Center.

Results

On average, headache intensity (measured on an 11-point pain numeric rating scale) decreased after interventions used in the Headache Treatment Center (mean change = 2.85 ± 2.81, P < .05, Cohen d = 1.01). Large effect sizes for reducing headache intensity were observed for pericranial, occipital/auriculotemporal, and occipital nerve blocks, Cohen d = 1.56, 1.64 and 1.02, respectively. Large effect sizes for reducing headache intensity also were observed for a transcutaneous supraorbital nerve stimulator device (Cefaly) (Cohen d = 1.02), acupuncture (Cohen d = 1.09), and intravenous migraine cocktails (Cohen d = 0.91–1.34).

Conclusion

Targeted headache therapies to abort pediatric primary headaches as part of a novel headache clinic model may be beneficial for short-term management.

### Diagnosis and management of migraine in ten steps [^822c6692]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2021). High credibility.

Migraine is a disabling primary headache disorder that directly affects more than one billion people worldwide. Despite its widespread prevalence, migraine remains under-diagnosed and under-treated. To support clinical decision-making, we convened a European panel of experts to develop a ten-step approach to the diagnosis and management of migraine. Each step was established by expert consensus and supported by a review of current literature, and the Consensus Statement is endorsed by the European Headache Federation and the European Academy of Neurology. In this Consensus Statement, we introduce typical clinical features, diagnostic criteria and differential diagnoses of migraine. We then emphasize the value of patient centricity and patient education to ensure treatment adherence and satisfaction with care provision. Further, we outline best practices for acute and preventive treatment of migraine in various patient populations, including adults, children and adolescents, pregnant and breastfeeding women, and older people. In addition, we provide recommendations for evaluating treatment response and managing treatment failure. Lastly, we discuss the management of complications and comorbidities as well as the importance of planning long-term follow-up.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the evaluation and management of adult patients presenting to the emergency department with acute headache [^590e066f]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Acute migraine — meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials of injectable opioids compared with other active agents found that meperidine was significantly less efficacious than dihydroergotamine (OR 0.30; 95% CI 0.09 to 0.97), caused more dizziness and sedation, and was less likely to result in return to normal functioning. There was a trend toward decreased efficacy of meperidine versus antiemetics (OR 0.46; 95% CI 0.19 to 1.11) and a higher rate of return to the hospital for patients who received meperidine, although the antiemetics caused a higher rate of akathisia. There were no significant differences in efficacy or adverse event profile between meperidine and ketorolac (OR 1.75; 95% CI 0.84 to 3.61). Injectable administration was defined as intravenous, intramuscular, or subcutaneous routes; studies required headache intensity data within 2 h of treatment, and the primary outcome was relief of headache within 1 h of medication administration.

### The place of corticosteroids in migraine attack management: a 65-year systematic review with pooled analysis and critical appraisal [^880c5b4c]. Cephalalgia (2015). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Headaches recur in up to 87% of migraine patients visiting the emergency department (ED), making ED recidivism a management challenge. We aimed herein to determine the role of corticosteroids in the acute management of migraine in the ED and outpatient care.

Methods

Advanced search strategies employing PubMed/MEDLINE, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases inclusive of a relevant gray literature search was employed for Clinical Studies and Systematic Reviews by combining the terms "migraine" and "corticosteroids" spanning all previous years since the production of synthetic corticosteroids ca. 1950 until August 30, 2014. Methods were in accordance with MOOSE guidelines.

Results

Twenty-five studies (n = 3989, median age 37.5 years, interquartile range or IQR 35–41 years; median male:female ratio 1:4.23, IQR 1:2.1–6.14; 52% ED-based, 56% randomized-controlled) and four systematic reviews were included. International Classification of Headache Disorders criteria were applied in 64%. Nineteen studies (76%) indicated observed outcome differences favoring benefits of corticosteroids, while six (24%) studies indicated non-inferior outcomes for corticosteroids. Median absolute risk reduction was 30% (range 6%-48.2%), and 11% (6%-48.6%) for 24-, and 72-hour headache recurrence, respectively. Parenteral dexamethasone was the most commonly (56%) administered steroid, at a median single dose of 10mg (range 4-24mg). All meta-analyses revealed efficacy of adjuvant corticosteroids to various abortive medications-indicating generalizability. Adverse effects were tolerable. Higher disability, status migrainosus, incomplete pain relief, and previous history of headache recurrence predicted outcome favorability.

Conclusions

Our literature review suggests that with corticosteroid treatment, recurrent headaches become milder than pretreated headaches and later respond to nonsteroidal therapy. Single-dose intravenous dexamethasone is a reasonable option for managing resistant, severe, or prolonged migraine attacks.

### Sumatriptan plus naproxen for the treatment of acute migraine attacks in adults [^bd4b527c]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

This is an updated version of the original Cochrane review published in October 2013 on 'Sumatriptan plus naproxen for acute migraine attacks in adults'. Migraine is a common disabling condition and a burden for the individual, health services, and society. It affects two to three times more women than men, and is most common in the age range 30 to 50 years. Effective abortive treatments include the triptan and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory classes of drugs. These drugs have different mechanisms of action and combining them may provide better relief. Sumatriptan plus naproxen is now available in combination form for the acute treatment of migraine.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy and tolerability of sumatriptan plus naproxen, administered together as separate tablets or taken as a fixed-dose combination tablet, compared with placebo and other active interventions in the treatment of acute migraine attacks in adults.

Search Methods

For this update we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) via The Cochrane Register of Studies Online (CRSO) to 28 October 2015, MEDLINE (via Ovid) from 1946 to 28 October 2015, and EMBASE (via Ovid) from 1974 to 28 October 2015, and two online databases (www.gsk-clinicalstudyregister.com and www.clinicaltrials.gov). We also searched the reference lists of included studies and relevant reviews.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised, double-blind, placebo- or active-controlled studies, with at least 10 participants per treatment arm, using sumatriptan plus naproxen to treat a migraine headache episode.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We used numbers of participants achieving each outcome to calculate risk ratio and numbers needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNT) or for an additional harmful outcome (NNH) compared with placebo or a different active treatment.

Main Results

For this update we identified one new study (43 participants), but it did not contribute any data for analysis. The review included 13 studies using sumatriptan 85 mg or 50 mg plus naproxen 500 mg to treat attacks of mild, moderate, or severe pain intensity. Twelve studies contributed data for analyses: 3663 participants received combination treatment, 3682 placebo, 964 sumatriptan, and 982 naproxen. We judged only one small study to be at high risk of bias for any of the criteria evaluated; it did not contribute to any analyses. Overall, the combination was better than placebo for the primary outcomes of pain-free and headache relief at two hours. The NNT for pain-free at two hours was 3.1 (95% confidence interval 2.9 to 3.5) when the baseline pain was mild (50% response with sumatriptan plus naproxen compared with 18% with placebo), and 4.9 (4.3 to 5.7) when baseline pain was moderate or severe (28% with sumatriptan plus naproxen compared with 8% with placebo) (high quality evidence). Using 50 mg of sumatriptan, rather than 85 mg, in the combination did not significantly change the result. Treating early, when pain was still mild, was significantly better than treating once pain was moderate or severe for pain-free responses at two hours and during the 24 hours post dose. Adverse events were mostly mild or moderate in severity and rarely led to withdrawal; they were more common with the combination than with placebo (moderate quality evidence). Where the data allowed direct comparison, combination treatment was superior to either monotherapy, but adverse events were less frequent with naproxen than with sumatriptan (moderate quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

The conclusions of this review were not changed. Combination treatment was effective in the acute treatment of migraine headaches. The effect was greater than for the same dose of either sumatriptan or naproxen alone, but additional benefits over sumatriptan alone were not large. More participants achieved good relief when medication was taken early in the attack, when pain was still mild. Adverse events were more common with the combination and sumatriptan alone than with placebo or naproxen alone.

### Effectiveness and safety of pharmacologic therapies for migraine in the emergency department: a systematic review and Bayesian network meta-analysis [^d2bf1d3f]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Study Objective

We performed a systematic review and Bayesian network meta-analysis to determine which pharmacologic therapies are relatively more effective and safer for migraine in adult patients who present to the emergency department (ED).

Methods

We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science from inception to February 9, 2024. Eligible studies were randomized controlled trials that enrolled adult participants presenting to ED with migraine and compared one pharmacologic therapy to another or placebo. Outcomes were as follows: 1) adequate pain relief at 2 hours, 2) change in pain intensity at 1 hour, 3) need for rescue drug at 2 hours, and 4) significant adverse reaction. We extracted data according to PRISMA-network meta-analysis and appraised trials using Cochrane RoB 2. For dichotomous outcomes, we performed Bayesian network meta-analysis to calculate odds ratios with 95% credible intervals; for continuous outcomes, we performed frequentist network meta-analysis to calculate mean differences with 95% confidence intervals. We assessed confidence using Confidence in Network Meta-analysis. We used Surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) to rank agents.

Results

Chlorpromazine intravenous (IV)/intramuscular (IM) (SUCRA = 87.3%) was most likely to be superior for "adequate pain relief at 2 hours" (24 trials; n = 2,361); metoclopramide IV-ibuprofen IV (SUCRA = 94.6%) was most likely to be superior for "need for rescue drug" (not needing rescue drug) at 2 hours (27 trials; n = 2,942); dexamethasone IV (SUCRA = 79.5%) was most likely to be superior for "significant adverse reaction" (not causing adverse reaction) (22 trials; n = 2,450). The network for change in pain intensity demonstrated statistically significant incoherence at the overall level. Confidence in network meta-analysis estimates (certainty of evidence) varied and was mostly "low" or "very low", limiting the validity of the probabilistic analyses.

Conclusions

According to Bayesian network meta-analysis, ibuprofen IV is definitely among the least effective for adequate pain relief; chlorpromazine IV/IM is definitely among the most effective; valproate IV is definitely among the least effective, and ketorolac IV/IM is possibly among the least effective as single agents. The relative safety of the pharmacologic therapies cannot be determined with sufficient certainty.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the evaluation and management of adult patients presenting to the emergency department with acute headache [^61c25188]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Emergency department (ED) acute migraine — intravenous valproate, metoclopramide, and ketorolac comparative efficacy is described from a randomized, double-blinded trial that investigated differences on an 11-point verbal pain scale (0 to 10) at 1 hour in an ED population. Patients improved by 2.8 points (95% CI 2.3 to 3.3) with valproate, 4.7 points (95% CI 4.2 to 5.2) with metoclopramide, and 3.9 points (95% CI 3.3 to 4.5) with ketorolac; between-group assessment found both metoclopramide and ketorolac outperformed valproate, metoclopramide directly outperforming ketorolac, but findings were neither compelling nor consistent enough to make firm conclusions in regard to either metoclopramide or ketorolac as a superior therapeutic agent.

1.3.3. Co-primary endpoint: Absence of the most bothersome symptom

Recommendation:

Absence of the most bothersome migraine-associated symptom at 2 hours after treatment may be used as a co-primary endpoint.

Comments:

In addition to headache pain, migraine attacks are characterized by a number of associated symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, photophobia, and phonophobia. To align outcomes in controlled trials with symptom(s) of clinical significance, it is important to measure the effects of an acute treatment on all these features. For regulatory purposes, the FDA recommends that efficacy analyses in acute trials use as co-primary endpoints the proportion of subjects with no headache pain at 2 hours after treatment and the proportion of subjects with absence of the most bothersome associated symptom (MBS) at 2 hours after treatment. The use of the MBS as a co-primary endpoint with pain freedom is an alternative to requesting demonstration of a positive treatment effect on all three migraine associated symptoms; it requires larger sample sizes due to the need to consider the frequency of the symptoms. The MBS endpoint should be selected just prior to study drug administration and measured on a binary scale (present or absent) using either of two suggested methods. One method allows subjects to select the MBS prior to randomization and then treat only an attack that occurs with the pre-specified MBS. The other is to use a time-locked recording device (e.g. an electronic diary) and have subjects record their MBS at the onset of the treated attack and then record the effect on the MBS at 2 hours. The trial protocol should specify which of these approaches will be used by all subjects in a clinical trial.

It should be noted that an effect on associated symptoms is very difficult to achieve in trials investigating early treatment, when headache is mild and associated symptoms may not have appeared yet. Moreover, measuring the elimination of an associated symptom that was not present at the time treatment was taken, especially for less common symptoms (e.g. nausea), substantially increases the required sample size and number of subjects that must be exposed. An alternative approach would be to record the elimination of all associated symptoms at 2 hours after treatment.

1.3.4. Secondary endpoints

### Paracetamol (acetaminophen) with or without an antiemetic for acute migraine headaches in adults [^71a85a90]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

This is an updated version of the original Cochrane review published in Issue 11, 2010 (Derry 2010). Migraine is a common, disabling condition and a burden for the individual, health services and society. Many sufferers choose not to, or are unable to, seek professional help and rely on over-the-counter analgesics. Co-therapy with an antiemetic should help to reduce nausea and vomiting, which are commonly associated with migraine.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy and tolerability of paracetamol (acetaminophen), alone or in combination with an antiemetic, compared with placebo and other active interventions in the treatment of acute migraine in adults.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Oxford Pain Relief Database for studies through 4 October 2010 for the original review, and to 13 February 2013 for the update. Two clinical trials registers (ClinicalTrials.gov and gsk-clinicalstudyregister.com) were also searched on both occasions.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised, double-blind, placebo- or active-controlled studies using self-administered paracetamol to treat a migraine headache episode, with at least 10 participants per treatment arm.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Numbers of participants achieving each outcome were used to calculate relative risk and numbers needed to treat (NNT) or harm (NNH) compared with placebo or other active treatment.

Main Results

Searches for the update identified one additional study for inclusion. Eleven studies (2942 participants, 5109 attacks) compared paracetamol 1000 mg, alone or in combination with an antiemetic, with placebo or other active comparators, mainly sumatriptan 100 mg. For all efficacy outcomes paracetamol was superior to placebo, with NNTs of 12 (19% response with paracetamol, 10% with placebo), 5.0 (56% response with paracetamol, 36% with placebo) and 5.2 (39% response with paracetamol, 20% with placebo) for 2-hour pain-free and 2- and 1-hour headache relief, respectively, when medication was taken for moderate to severe pain. Paracetamol 1000 mg plus metoclopramide 10 mg was not significantly different from oral sumatriptan 100 mg for 2-hour headache relief; there were no 2-hour pain-free data. Adverse event rates were similar between paracetamol and placebo, and between paracetamol plus metoclopramide and sumatriptan. No serious adverse events occurred with paracetamol alone, but more serious and/or severe adverse events occurred with sumatriptan than with the combination therapy (NNH 32).

Authors' Conclusions

Paracetamol 1000 mg alone is statistically superior to placebo in the treatment of acute migraine, but the NNT of 12 for pain-free response at two hours is inferior to at of other commonly used analgesics. Given the low cost and wide availability of paracetamol, it may be a useful first choice drug for acute migraine in those with contraindications to, or who cannot tolerate, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or aspirin. The addition of 10 mg metoclopramide gives short-term efficacy equivalent to oral sumatriptan 100 mg. Adverse events with paracetamol did not differ from placebo; serious and/or severe adverse events were slightly more common with sumatriptan than with paracetamol plus metoclopramide.

### Aspirin with or without an antiemetic for acute migraine headaches in adults [^4924b05d]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

This is an updated version of the original Cochrane review published in Issue 4, 2010 (Kirthi 2010). Migraine is a common, disabling condition and a burden for the individual, health services and society. Many sufferers choose not to, or are unable to, seek professional help and rely on over-the-counter analgesics. Co-therapy with an antiemetic should help to reduce nausea and vomiting commonly associated with migraine headaches.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy and tolerability of aspirin, alone or in combination with an antiemetic, compared to placebo and other active interventions in the treatment of acute migraine headaches in adults.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Oxford Pain Relief Database, ClinicalTrials.gov, and reference lists for studies through 10 March 2010 for the original review and to 31 January 2013 for the update.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled or active-controlled studies, or both, using aspirin to treat a migraine headache episode, with at least 10 participants per treatment arm.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Numbers of participants achieving each outcome were used to calculate relative risk and numbers needed to treat (NNT) or harm (NNH) compared to placebo or other active treatment.

Main Results

No new studies were found for this update. Thirteen studies (4222 participants) compared aspirin 900 mg or 1000 mg, alone or in combination with metoclopramide 10 mg, with placebo or other active comparators, mainly sumatriptan 50 mg or 100 mg. For all efficacy outcomes, all active treatments were superior to placebo, with NNTs of 8.1, 4.9 and 6.6 for 2-hour pain-free, 2-hour headache relief, and 24-hour headache relief with aspirin alone versus placebo, and 8.8, 3.3 and 6.2 with aspirin plus metoclopramide versus placebo. Sumatriptan 50 mg did not differ from aspirin alone for 2-hour pain-free and headache relief, while sumatriptan 100 mg was better than the combination of aspirin plus metoclopramide for 2-hour pain-free, but not headache relief; there were no data for 24-hour headache relief. Adverse events were mostly mild and transient, occurring slightly more often with aspirin than placebo. Additional metoclopramide significantly reduced nausea (P < 0.00006) and vomiting (P = 0.002) compared with aspirin alone.

Authors' Conclusions

We found no new studies since the last version of this review. Aspirin 1000 mg is an effective treatment for acute migraine headaches, similar to sumatriptan 50 mg or 100 mg. Addition of metoclopramide 10 mg improves relief of nausea and vomiting. Adverse events were mainly mild and transient, and were slightly more common with aspirin than placebo, but less common than with sumatriptan 100 mg.

Dexamethasone versus intravenous morphine for migraine — patients 18 to 65 y received blinded administration of 8 mg dexamethasone or IV morphine at 0.1 mg/kg, with headache severity measured using a VAS 10-cm scale at baseline, 10 min, 60 min, and 24 h after intervention. N = 190 patients had clinically important decreases (> 2.2 cm) in both study arms with no significant differences between groups: 0 min 8.49 dexamethasone vs 8.75 morphine, 60 min 2.89 dexamethasone vs 2.33 morphine, and 24 h 0.64 dexamethasone vs 1.03 morphine; and VAS scores ≤ 1 at 24 h.
