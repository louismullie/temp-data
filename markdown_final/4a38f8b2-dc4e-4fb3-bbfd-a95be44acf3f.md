## Question

A 71-year-old woman comes to the physician because of dizziness and intermittent episodes of heart palpitations for 5 days. During this time, she has also had one episode of syncope. An ECG shows absence of P waves and irregular RR intervals. Treatment with an antiarrhythmic drug is initiated. The effect of the drug on the cardiac action potential is shown. Which of the following cardiac ion channels is most likely targeted by this drug?
A. Voltage-gated nonselective cation channels
B. Voltage-gated sodium channels
C. Voltage-gated potassium channels
D. Voltage-gated chloride channels

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which cardiac ion channel is most likely targeted by an antiarrhythmic drug in a 71-year-old woman presenting with dizziness, palpitations, syncope, and an ECG showing absent P waves with irregular RR intervals, and how to interpret the provided action potential diagram to choose among options A–D. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what the ECG diagnosis is and how that guides drug selection. Then, I should verify the Vaughan-Williams class of drugs typically used here and their principal ion-channel target. Next, I will review the other answer choices and check for exceptions or lookalikes that could confuse the mechanism. Finally, I will match the action potential diagram's effects to the expected physiology of sodium channel blockade and confirm the best answer.

> Let me first confirm the rhythm diagnosis. Absent P waves with irregularly irregular R–R intervals is classic for atrial fibrillation, and in a patient with palpitations and syncope, rhythm-control strategies are often considered. In early, short-duration AF, pharmacologic cardioversion with class IC agents is reasonable when carefully selected and monitored, so the clinical context points toward a class IC sodium channel blocker rather than a potassium channel blocker, even though class III agents are also used for rhythm control in other scenarios [^115AaFn6].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — I should confirm the drug class. Class I antiarrhythmics are defined by fast sodium channel blockade. Subclass IC has slow offset kinetics and markedly slows phase 0 depolarization and conduction, which fits the usual acute rhythm-control approach for recent-onset AF with careful pretreatment for AV nodal protection and structural heart disease exclusion in guidelines and practice patterns.

> I will now examine the channel target. Class I antiarrhythmics, including IC agents such as flecainide and propafenone, exert their therapeutic and proarrhythmic effects primarily via voltage-gated sodium channel (NaV1.5) blockade that slows the rapid inward sodium current during phase 0, thereby reducing excitability and slowing conduction. Flecainide also has use-dependent binding and clinically produces QRS widening reflecting sodium channel blockade [^111pYgJm].

> Wait, let me verify the other options so I don't misattribute. Voltage-gated potassium channels are the principal target of class III antiarrhythmics (e.g., amiodarone, dofetilide, sotalol), which prolong repolarization and action potential duration and are not the typical first choice for acute pharmacologic cardioversion of new-onset AF in the absence of structural heart disease; at first glance I wondered if the ECG irregularity implied a potassium channel effect, but that would be a mismatch for the usual acute rhythm-control drug here [^116cajCg]. Calcium channels are targeted by class IV agents, and nonselective cation channels are not a recognized target for the standard antiarrhythmic used in this setting, making options A and C less likely; chloride channels contribute minimally to human cardiac action potential physiology and are not therapeutic targets for these drugs [^116cajCg].

> Next, I should review how the action potential diagram informs this. A drug that flattens the phase 0 upstroke, slows Vmax, and broadens the QRS complex corresponds to sodium channel blockade. Flecainide produces QRS prolongation and slow dissociation from the sodium channel, aligning with the expected electrophysiologic signature of class IC blockade on the action potential morphology and surface ECG [^114CiRyQ] [^111pYgJm].

> But wait, what if there are safety nuances I'm overlooking? I need to ensure I acknowledge that class IC agents are contraindicated in patients with structural heart disease or prior myocardial infarction due to increased mortality in CAST and related data, and that pretreatment with AV nodal blockers is advised to mitigate 1:1 atrial flutter conduction. These cautions do not change the channel target but reinforce that the most likely mechanism here remains sodium channel blockade when appropriately selected [^114HDfy3] [^117UJqB5].

> Putting this together, the ECG diagnosis of new-onset atrial fibrillation with consideration of pharmacologic cardioversion, the Vaughan-Williams class IC profile, and the expected action potential effects all converge on voltage-gated sodium channels as the primary target. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Voltage-gated sodium channels [^116cajCg] [^114CiRyQ].

---

The ECG shows **atrial fibrillation** with absent P waves and irregular RR intervals, indicating disorganized atrial activity and variable AV conduction [^117UJqB5]. The most likely antiarrhythmic is a **class IC agent** (e.g. flecainide), which **blocks voltage-gated sodium channels** [^114CiRyQ] to slow phase 0 depolarization, reduce conduction velocity, and suppress arrhythmogenic activity [^115AaFn6]. Therefore, the correct answer is **B. Voltage-gated sodium channels**.

---

## Clinical significance of ECG findings

- **Absent P waves**: Reflect disorganized atrial electrical activity characteristic of atrial fibrillation [^115AaFn6].
- **Irregular RR intervals**: Indicate variable AV conduction, a hallmark of atrial fibrillation [^notfound].
- **Syncope**: Suggests hemodynamically significant arrhythmia, warranting urgent rhythm control [^notfound].

## Mechanism of action of class IC antiarrhythmic drugs

Class IC antiarrhythmics (e.g. flecainide, propafenone) **block voltage-gated sodium channels** [^114CiRyQ], producing **slowed phase 0 depolarization**, reduced conduction velocity, and suppression of arrhythmogenic activity [^116cajCg]. They exhibit **slow dissociation kinetics** and use-dependence, binding more strongly at higher heart rates, which enhances antiarrhythmic efficacy but also increases proarrhythmic risk [^114CiRyQ].

---

## Electrophysiological effects on cardiac action potential

Class IC agents **slow phase 0 depolarization** by blocking fast inward sodium current (INa), thereby reducing conduction velocity and suppressing arrhythmias [^114CiRyQ]. They also **prolong the effective refractory period** in atrial tissue, which helps prevent reentry circuits [^115AaFn6].

---

## Clinical implications and risks

- **Proarrhythmic risk**: Class IC drugs can precipitate ventricular arrhythmias, especially in patients with structural heart disease or prior myocardial infarction [^1153wXoE].
- **Contraindications**: Avoid in patients with structural heart disease, prior MI, or significant conduction disturbances [^112VxDsL].
- **Monitoring**: Regular ECG monitoring is essential to detect conduction slowing or proarrhythmia [^notfound].

## Antiarrhythmic drug classes and ion channel targets

| **Class** | **Mechanism of action** | **Ion channel target** | **Examples** |
|-|-|-|-|
| I | Sodium channel blockers | Voltage-gated sodium channels | Flecainide, propafenone, lidocaine |
| II | Beta-blockers | β-adrenergic receptors | Metoprolol, propranolol |
| III | Potassium channel blockers | Voltage-gated potassium channels | Amiodarone, sotalol, dofetilide |
| IV | Calcium channel blockers | Voltage-gated calcium channels | Verapamil, diltiazem |

---

Given the ECG findings and clinical context, the antiarrhythmic drug most likely targets **voltage-gated sodium channels** [^114CiRyQ], consistent with class IC agents used for atrial fibrillation [^117UJqB5].

For effects on the cancer VGSC / nNa v 1.5 to be clinically significant, it is necessary to block the pathophysiological I NaP but not the physiological I NaT. This is due to the fact that I NaT drives the generation of APs that enable nerve conduction and muscle function including heartbeat in the healthy body. Selective blockage of I NaP is possible using the anti-angina drug, ranolazine -the central theme of this perspective.

Propensity for Arrhythmia

The negative cytosolic resting membrane potential (phase 4) of approximately −80 mV is maintained largely by the action of transmembrane cellular pumps (predominantly Na + /K + ATPase and Na + /Ca 2+ exchanger) and closed voltage‐gated ion channels (Figure 1). 12, 13 The cardiac action potential (AP) is initiated in the sinoatrial node (SAN) by the slowly leaking inward "funny" current sodium channels (I f), leading to the recruitment of Ca 2+ channels and causing the positive depolarization current (phase 0). Gap junctions facilitate spread to adjacent cells in the atria, internodal tracts, atrioventricular node (AVN), His bundle, and both right and left bundles, the Purkinje cells, and finally, the ventricular myocardium. Phase 0 in all of the heart cells except for the SAN and AVN is caused by the opening of Na + channels, flooding the cytoplasm with Na + ions and causing the positive depolarization of the membrane. As the wave of depolarization spreads, sarcoplasmic Ca 2+ release leads to muscular contraction (excitation‐contraction coupling). Immediately after phase 0, repolarization begins with phase 1 (largely due to Cl − ions), followed by phase 2, the plateau stage where the inner membrane potential remains relatively constant due to the influx of Ca 2+. Phase 3 is the latter stage of repolarization and the relative refractory period, during which a new stimulus such as a ventricular extrasystole (VE) can trigger arrhythmia. AP duration is determined largely by activation of K + channels. Thus, inactivation and/or down‐regulation of these K + channels, which can be primary in genetic LQTS or secondary to other pathological states, can prolong the QTc on the surface ECG. Neurohumoral changes can modify the regionally specific AP further: increased sympathetic tone increases automaticity and conduction velocity and decreases the AP duration, leading to more rapid AP firing and recovery. Conversely, heightened parasympathetic tone decreases automaticity and prolongs the refractory periods.

### Atrial-ventricular differences in rabbit cardiac voltage-gated nacurrents: basis for atrial-selective block by ranolazine [^115AaFn6]. Heart Rhythm (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Atrial fibrillation (AF), characterized by rapid and irregular electrical activation of the atria, reduced cardiac output, poor response to exercise, and fatigue, is the most commonly occurring clinical arrhythmia. AF is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, principally through an elevated risk of thromboembolism and ischemic stroke owing to inadequate emptying of the atria, although the elevated ventricular rate can also contribute to tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy and decompensated heart failure. The condition tends to be progressive, with paroxysms of AF leading with time to persistent and permanent AF. The progressive nature of AF is thought to arise through the elevated rate causing electrical and structural remodeling that stabilizes the arrhythmia. Early intervention to prevent and/or control the arrhythmia is therefore highly desirable.

The activation of voltage-gated Na + channels underlies the propagation and conduction of the action potential through the heart, whereas their subsequent inactivation initiates a refractory period that is usually determined by the duration of the action potential. Voltage-gated Na + channels are a major target for antiarrhythmic drugs, as the combined effects of reduction in membrane excitability, conduction velocity slowing, and prolongation of the refractory period can both suppress triggered activity and extinguish reentrant activity. Blockers of voltage-gated Na + channels with relatively slow dissociation kinetics (ie, the class Ia and Ic antiarrhythmic drugs of the Vaughan-Williams classification) are effective in the cardioversion of early-onset AF and the maintenance of sinus rhythm. The class Ic drugs, flecainide and propafenone, are recommended as a suitable "pill-in-the-pocket".

Potential implications of CiPA

ICH E14 states that it is inconclusive as to whether drugs that prolong QTc are pro‐arrhythmic and that certain factors may modify the risk of QTc prolongation, including prolonging QTc up to a "plateau" value and that pro‐arrhythmic risk might be influenced by other pharmacologic effects (e.g. other ion channel effects in addition to hERG block). 2 Although ICH S7B and E14 guidelines state that the presence of QTc prolongation does not mean that a drug will cause arrhythmias and the presence of QTc prolongation should support planning for and interpretation of subsequent clinical studies, the way they have been used in practice has been to sometimes drop compounds or drugs from development, which may not always be appropriate. 40

One of the potential impacts of CiPA is to better inform when QTc prolonging drugs require intensive ECG monitoring in phase III trials. ICH E14 describes a nuanced approach for ECG monitoring in late stage trials in the question and answer (Q&A; see figure 1 in Vicente et al. 13). Briefly, the results can be divided into categories of whether the mean ΔΔQTc at therapeutic exposures is < 10 ms, 10–20 ms or > 20 ms. In the current ICH E14 Q&A, if the ΔΔQTc at maximal "worst case" therapeutic exposures is < 10 ms, only routine ECG monitoring is recommended in late phase trials. However, if higher exposures are only expected in a limited subset of patients, intensive ECG monitoring may only be required in that specific patient population. If the ΔΔQTc effect is 10–20 ms at therapeutic exposure, intensive ECGs are needed, and if ΔΔQTc is > 20 ms, intensive ECGs and risk mitigation strategies are warranted.

It has been proposed that CiPA could impact clinical development for a drug with ΔΔQTc effect of 10–20 ms at worst‐case therapeutic exposures, in which a combined nonclinical and clinical integrated risk assessment should be taken into account to determine what level of ECG monitoring is appropriate in phase III. If the ΔΔQTc effect is > 20 ms at therapeutic concentrations, it is anticipated that intensive ECG monitoring would still be required; however, the combined nonclinical and clinical data could be taken into account to better inform the type and extent of ECG monitoring and risk mitigation strategies. In addition, a goal of CiPA is to enable updating drug labels to be more informative about pro‐arrhythmic risk, not just QT prolongation.

### Structural basis for modulation of human na1.3 by clinical drug and selective antagonist [^113UhLCz]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Eukaryotic Na V s are structurally closely related with each other because they share high amino acid sequence similarity. Na V s are composed of a large pore-forming α-subunit and regulatory β-subunits. The α-subunit has 24 transmembrane segments organized into four domains (I−IV), each of which contains 6 segments (S1−S6). The first four segments (S1−S4) of each domain form the voltage-sensor domain (VSD), and S5, S6 and the pore-loop between them form the pore module (PM). The intracellular ends of the four pore-lining S6 helices form the activation gate. In addition, the loop connecting D III and D IV forms the inactivation gate. Four isoforms of β-subunits (β1−β4) are reported to regulate Na V s' kinetics and cell surface expression, and they share similar structures with an N-terminal immunoglobulin domain followed by a signal transmembrane segment. Recent advances of structural studies revealed that eukaryotic Na V s share conserved structural features –. Moreover, multiple natural toxins or clinical-used small-molecule drugs targeting distinct receptor sites in Na V s were revealed at atomic level, which suggest complicated regulatory mechanisms for Na V functions –. To date, most local anesthetic or anti-arrhythmic drugs bind to the central pore of Na V s to block sodium conductance. However, the nearly identical pore regions of different Na V s dampen the enthusiasm in finding isoform-selective drug targeting the pore. As a consequence, new drug binding sites on Na V s and isoform-selective drugs are eagerly awaited to minimize potential off-target side effects.

### Mechanisms of chemical atrial defibrillation by flecainide and ibutilide [^117N6BtX]. JACC: Clinical Electrophysiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Decades of clinical data and basic discovery research have resulted in a deep and broad understanding of drugs that target cardiac ion channels, and a clear opportunity to apply well-studied drugs to acutely treat cardiac arrhythmia. – A critical expansion of the methodologies employed to eliminate the risk of drug-induced proarrhythmia is to extend clinical and basic research to examine how drugs, either alone or in combination, can be utilized to terminate arrhythmias. Proarrhythmia can be a paradoxical occurrence when a drug intended for treating arrhythmias exacerbates or induces arrhythmia. – Thus, it is imperative to identify and steer clear of drugs with such potential, particularly in patients already susceptible to arrhythmias. It is equally crucial to explore the effective utilization of drugs for terminating arrhythmias, especially in emergent scenarios where restoring normal sinus rhythm must be done quickly and efficiently. – The application of drug therapy in acute settings for chemical defibrillation holds promise, as drugs can be swiftly administered for therapy and withdrawn with minimal risk of long-term side effects or tissue damage. –

Regarding specific circumstances for ventricular arrhythmias, more specifically with respect to patients with medication-induced arrhythmia, ACC/AHA/HRS 2018 guidelines recommend to consider discontinuing the presumed responsible medication or re-programming the device to restore effective device therapy in patients taking sodium channel blockers presenting with elevated defibrillation or pacing thresholds.

### Structural basis for inhibition of the cardiac sodium channel by the atypical antiarrhythmic drug ranolazine [^1127amTo]. Nature Cardiovascular Research (2023). High credibility.

Ranolazine's clinically relevant actions occur through high-affinity (~5 μM) block of the late sodium current, I NaL, which is increased in cardiac disease and in patients carrying genetic mutations that destabilize inactivation. Ranolazine can also can block peak I Na in experimental preparations. However, its IC 50 for inhibition of peak I Na is ~10-fold higher than the therapeutic concentration of 2–8 μM in plasma; therefore, inhibition of peak I Na by ranolazine is relevant only in the context of pathological depolarization, rapid action potential firing, or both, as in atrial fibrillation. Like class IB AADs, ranolazine binds and dissociates during each cardiac cycle at therapeutic concentration, which prevents cumulative inhibition of the peak sodium current. The minimal effect of ranolazine on peak I Na at therapeutic concentrations, paired with its high affinity for late I Na, probably explains its lack of proarrhythmia relative to other class I AADs, which exert their sodium-channel blocking effects primarily on peak I Na and cause substantial cumulative block over time. The structural interactions presented here provide a compelling explanation for these differential effects compared with class I AADs by showing that ranolazine acts as a structural clamp that induces tight binding of the IFM inactivation particle to the π-helical form of DIV-S6 and thereby prevents the reopenings that generate I NaL. We hypothesize that the unstable inactivation gating that produces I NaL releases DIV-S6 from the IFM inactivation particle during the repolarization phase of the gating cycle, thereby allowing increased availability of the π-helical form of DIV-S6 for drug binding. In this context, ranolazine's unique chemistry and binding kinetics allow it to restore inactivation to these channels by capturing the π-helix (Fig. 4a, b), both during drug binding and for tens of milliseconds after drug dissociation, which allows peak sodium current to flow and prevents activation of I NaL.

Treatment of arrhythmia — basic pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics: Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics are stated as essential for understanding therapeutic drug delivery, and antiarrhythmic drugs are described as less commonly first-line for ventricular arrhythmias but frequently adjunctive and used for atrial fibrillation; fellows should understand basic pharmacokinetic principles (absorption; distribution with effects of heart failure and shock; metabolism via cytochrome P450 and p‑glycoprotein; effects of other drugs, diet, and genetic variants; and elimination by liver, kidney, and lungs), clinical pharmacokinetics (drug interactions; effects of age, gender, and disease states), and pharmacodynamics (how drugs act via receptors; agonists and antagonists), as well as antiarrhythmic-specific topics including the utility and limitations of classification schemes (Vaughan‑Williams, Sicilian Gambit), effects on ion channels and on conduction and refractoriness of atrial and ventricular myocardium, bypass tracts, and His‑Purkinje tissue, and for individual agents the indications, contraindications, dosages, and drug interactions with considerations for renal, hepatic, or heart failure, hypertrophy, or abnormal repolarization.

### Neuronal nav1.8 channels as a novel therapeutic target of acute atrial fibrillation prevention [^1123W8iJ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Genome‐wide association studies have opened up a new horizon in understanding cardiac electrophysiology. Several independent loci of SCN10A were indicated to increase PR and/or QRS intervals, which were regarded as intermediate phenotypes, suggesting the risk of conduction disease and arrhythmia susceptibility. 37, 38 There is an increased number of studies that focus on the relationship of SCN10A /Na v 1.8 with cardiac diseases. In spite of several disputes such as the expression of Na v 1.8 in the heart, 36, 39 Na v 1.8 is critical in cardiac electrophysiology. Our previous study first reported 17 putative pathogenic SCN10A variants in 25 of 150 Brugada syndrome probands with a positive proband yield of 16.7%, approaching our historical yield of 20.1% for SCN5A. Subsequent studies from others also emphasize the importance of SCN10A in both rare and common variants in Brugada syndrome. 9 One recent study concluded that rs6795970 might be associated with cardiac conduction abnormalities in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. 40 Therefore, it has come a long way as the "new cardiac sodium channel", and the exact roles of Na v 1.8 in arrhythmia still have a long way to go. It can be considered as a novel target in understanding cardiac electrophysiology, and its selective blocker or other relative drug might be promising in SCN10A ‐related arrhythmias.

### A molecularly detailed na1.5 model reveals a new class I antiarrhythmic target [^113AH8aC]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

We have developed a model of the Na + channel that for the first time includes explicit representation of the molecular movements which shape the action potential and form the basis of the differential sensitivity to the common antiarrhythmic drug mexiletine. After expanding the model to account for the pharmacokinetic variables of mexiletine drug binding and the role of the DIII-VSD, the model was used to develop a precision-targeted mexiletine booster that was able to effectively rescue a mexiletine-resistant LQT3 mutation. Our results suggest a promising future avenue of drug development, namely exploitation of nontraditional ion channel drug targets, which allows for precision-targeted and mutation-specific pharmacotherapy for both LQT3 mutations and an enhanced mexiletine for ventricular tachycardia, with a more favorable side effect profile.

Perspectives

COMPETENCY IN MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE: Class I antiarrhythmic therapies remain suboptimal given the inability to predict efficacy and potential proarrhythmic side effects. The Class Ib drug mexiletine has been show to have differential efficacy based on key molecular determinants of the Na+ channel. This study used computational modeling to understand the molecular basis of drug efficacy, and then designed an in-silico mexiletine booster that could improve efficacy.

TRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOK: Drug discovery remains expensive, time-consuming, and has an unacceptably high failure rate. Computational modeling approaches to drug discovery represent a novel tool to design and test precision-targeted therapeutic agents, premised on a detailed understanding of the molecular underpinnings of drug efficacy. By exploiting nontraditional ion channel drug targets, we can add an entirely new dimension to the wide parameter space of traditional antiarrhythmic drugs to develop more precision-targeted and potent Class I therapeutic agents.

### Guidance on short-term management of atrial fibrillation in coronavirus disease 2019 [^114e1RbC]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Atrial fibrillation is a common clinical manifestation in hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19). Medications used to treat atrial fibrillation, such as antiarrhythmic drugs and anticoagulants, may have significant drug interactions with emerging COVID‐19 treatments. Common unintended nontherapeutic target effects of COVID‐19 treatment include potassium channel blockade, cytochrome P 450 isoenzyme inhibition or activation, and P‐glycoprotein inhibition. Drug‐drug interactions with antiarrhythmic drugs and anticoagulants in these patients may lead to significant bradycardia, ventricular arrhythmias, or severe bleeding. It is important for clinicians to be aware of these interactions, drug metabolism changes, and clinical consequences when choosing antiarrhythmic drugs and anticoagulants for COVID‐19 patients with atrial fibrillation. The objective of this review is to provide a practical guide for clinicians who are managing COVID‐19 patients with concomitant atrial fibrillation.

Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text

Genetic testing, after appropriate genetic counseling and informed consent, may facilitate identification of a molecular cause of SCA by identifying pathogenic variants in genes associated with specific phenotypes and fulfilling formal disease-based diagnostic criteria. Examples of scenarios in which discovery of a genetic cause of SCA may influence management recommendations include administration of beta blockade for patients with long QT syndrome, sodium channel inhibition in long QT syndrome type 3, – flecainide administration for patients with CPVT, or exercise restriction recommendations in patients with arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy. Genetic evaluation may also influence family screening by facilitating cascade genetic testing and clinical surveillance in relatives at greatest risk for disease.
2. and 3. Genetic tests have variable yield and may result in discovery of variants of uncertain clinical significance, which can be frequent and challenging to interpret. Using genetic tests that comprise well-established genes related to a suspected or diagnosed genetic phenotype is most likely to result in discovery of disease-causing variants in an individual or family, while minimizing the probability of discovering a variant of uncertain clinical significance. In contrast, genetic tests with more comprehensive genomic coverage may lead to moderately increased diagnostic yield but at the expense of increased rates of discovery of variants of uncertain clinical significance. Nevertheless, given a rapidly evolving understanding of the molecular causes of specific phenotypes and increased yield of broader genetic assessment, tests that include broader coverage may be considered in select circumstances, such as when a heritable phenotype is being mapped within a family or assessment for de novo variation is sought through sequencing of multiple family members. The latter examples would only be pertinent when it becomes apparent that a familial trait is likely or there has been exome sequencing in a trio of confirmed parents and the index case.
Genetic evaluation appears to be highest for individuals with a phenotype consistent with a genetic cause, and is lower among SCA survivors without a clearly identifiable genetic phenotype.– Nevertheless, individuals with an idiopathic cause of SCA may eventually develop a diagnosis of a genetic etiology during long-term follow-up. Genetic testing can identify variants during the concealed phase of a genetic disease such as arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy, or in individuals with conditions otherwise regarded as nongenetic such as in drug-induced long QT syndrome. As such, a low but non-negligible yield for genetic testing appears to be present among individuals with idiopathic SCA.
In individuals with a well-established nongenetic cause of SCA, the routine use of genetic evaluation is not recommended owing to the potential for discovery of variants of uncertain significance and misdiagnosis.
Figure 16 summarizes the recommendations from Section 7.

Table 3
Schwartz Score for SQTS Diagnostic Criteria

ICD is the primary therapeutic choice for symptomatic SQTS patients at risk of SCD and with a life expectancy surpassing 30 years. Suitable candidates for ICDs to prevent cardiac arrest include individuals with documented situations of spontaneous sustained VTs, with or without syncope, and those who successfully overcame a prior cardiac arrest. In young patients or patients with contraindications to ICD therapy, pharmacological therapy can be used. Quinidine is the first‐line pharmacologic intervention for treating SQTS. Hydroquinidine can be used to prolong the QT interval as it acts as a multichannel blocker, prolonging the AP length by interfering with the I Kr channel. However, hydroquinidine's role in decreasing cardiac events is unclear. On another hand, amiodarone and sotalol are ineffective in treating patients with SQTS1 even though they are QT‐prolonging drugs that block the I Kr channel. This may be attributed to ion channel mutations affecting drug effects and channel gating properties. Currently, data on pharmacologic therapy in SQTS is limited, primarily focusing on patients with SQTS1, and necessitates further research on targeted drug interventions for specific SQTS gene variants.

Heart Rhythm (2020). High credibility.

COVID-19 resuscitation and arrhythmia management — For cardiac arrest in confirmed or suspected COVID-19, the number of personnel in the room "should be minimized", and "All participants should don PPE before entering the patient's room". Because of aerosolization risk, "consideration should be given to early intubation along with the use of external mechanical compression devices and airborne precautions during intubation". Therapeutically, "At the time of this writing, it is unclear what medications may be beneficial for patients with COVID-19", and "Although we are not recommending any specific treatment, safety guidance for clinicians using hydroxychloroquine may be requested of electrophysiology providers". Hydroxychloroquine "is known to block Kv11.1 (HERG) and can cause drug-induced long QT", and "The clinical arrhythmic toxicity (syncope and torsade de pointes) is largely limited to chronic use (because of its long half-life of 40 days), use of multiple concomitant QT-prolonging medications (eg, azithromycin)".

Atrial‑selective antiarrhythmic strategies and targets — One approach is to identify 'atrial specific' drugs that act mainly on the atria, which would be expected to increase the efficacy and decrease the ventricular proarrhythmic risk. Vernakalant has such properties because INa block increases at faster rates and at more positive membrane potential, and its rapid onset/offset kinetics implies a lower risk of conduction disturbances or proarrhythmia as heart rate slows; ranolazine shares some of these characteristics. Selective atrial targets include the ultra‑rapid potassium current (IKur), for which investigational blockers that prolong AP without proarrhythmic risk are under study but may be limited by IKur down‑regulation during AF, and the TASK‑1 channel, a two‑pore‑domain potassium channel (K2P) specifically expressed in atria whose inhibition will have a Vaughan Williams Class III effect; TASK‑1 shows affinity with some IKur‑acting AADs, is inhibited by amiodarone, and other K2P members including TREK‑1 are inhibited by existing AADs.

### Cardiac potassium inward rectifier kir2: review of structure, regulation, pharmacology, and arrhythmogenesis [^116TGgrR]. Heart Rhythm (2021). Medium credibility.

I K1 is susceptible to modulation by pharmacologic agents, which initially were identified as blocking other ion channels. Quinidine is used clinically to terminate atrial fibrillation as a Class IA antiarrhythmic drug. However, it is well documented to be a multichannel inhibitor. It was demonstrated that quinidine inhibited Kir2.1 by acute pore block of subunits via interactions with E224, F254, and D259 residues. Further investigation of other Kir2.x isoforms revealed Kir2.3 to have the highest affinity for quinidine. Block is achieved in a voltage-dependent manner, with residues E224, F254, D259, and E299 essential for block in Kir2.1 and corresponding residues in Kir2.3; however, only D260 was essential in Kir2.2. Mutational analysis of PIP 2 sensitivity sites revealed that high PIP 2 affinity resulted in low inhibition by quinidine and vice versa. Although Kir2.1 is the least sensitive to quinidine compared to Kir2.2 and Kir2.3, caution still should be used when prescribing this drug to avoid potential proarrhythmic effects.

Propafenone, another Vaughn-Williams Class IC antiarrhythmic drug, was also shown to inhibit Kir2 channels. It has greater efficacy for Kir2.3 compared to Kir2.2 and Kir2.1, most likely related to differences in PIP 2 affinity. Interestingly, extracellular K + does not affect inhibition by propafenone; however, decreasing intracellular K + results in subconductance levels in channel gating and reduced affinity for PIP 2. Using mutagenesis, propafenone binds to a cytoplasmic domain located at the interface between subunits, with conserved arginine residues 228 and 260 being important for binding.

### Inhibition of the K2 potassium channel in atrial fibrillation: a randomized phase 2 trial [^1169g1CW]. Nature Medicine (2024). Excellent credibility.

Existing drugs with different mechanisms of action, when effective in AF cardioversion, also show efficacy in sinus rhythm maintenance (prevention of AF recurrence). Our demonstration of human cardioversion efficacy through inhibition of K Ca 2 suggests that this may also be a promising drug target for maintaining sinus rhythm.

This trial has some limitations. We enrolled patients with an AF episode lasting less than 7 days. Other drugs have shown decreased efficacy with longer AF durations –, and efficacy should not be generalized to patients with longer AF episodes. The trial had a limited sample size. The early termination of the trial because of slow enrollment, which prevented testing doses higher than 5 mg kg −1. Underrepresentation of female patients in the trial was another limitation. Collectively, the results of this phase 2 trial should be considered hypothesis-generating; the efficacy and safety, in particular the potential consequences of QT prolongation, need to be studied in a larger phase 3 trial.

In conclusion, the K Ca 2 inhibitor AP30663 demonstrated superior AF cardioversion efficacy compared with placebo in patients with recent-onset AF episodes. AP30663 caused a transient increase of the QTc interval, but no ventricular arrhythmias were observed. K Ca 2 inhibition may be an attractive pathway for rhythm control of AF and should be studied in future randomized trials.

Mechanisms of ventricular arrhythmogenesis

Normal cardiac excitability results from a balance of depolarising and repolarising ionic currents. Each ionic current can be distinguished by its ionic selectivity and time course, which are properties that are conferred by specific ion channels (for more details see review by Behr et al). Mutations in any of the genes involved in regulation of cardiac ion channels may potentially result in arrhythmias and may be classified as arising from either abnormal AP formation or abnormal AP propagation (figure 1).

Figure 1
Mechanisms contributing to arrhythmogenesis. (A) Triggered activity, the upper trace shows an early after-depolarisation (EAD) occurring during repolarisation. The lower trace shows a delayed after-depolarisation (DAD) occurring following repolarisation. Dotted lines indicate the generation of an extra action potential with a sufficiently sized after-depolarisation. (B) Re-entrant circuit, the upper diagram shows a normal pattern of excitation with impulse propagating equally at each bifurcation and extinguishing in the middle. The lower diagram shows an area of slowed conduction velocity in one of the branches. The normal impulse shown by the solid arrow does not get extinguished as indicated by the delayed dotted arrow, allowing it to excite the myocardium. The delayed impulse is then able to circulate around the junctions resulting in inappropriate excitation of the rest of the myocardium. (C) Spatial heterogeneities in the form of transmural gradients. The epicardial action potential duration is much shorter than the endocardial potentially leading to re-excitation. (D) Temporal heterogeneities in the form of discordant action potential duration alternans. Regions which alternate out of phase generate a line of block called the nodal line between them. This has the potential to act as a focus for re-entrant circuits following the addition of a triggered beat.

Ventricular arrhythmias — automaticity explains that normal automaticity results from phase 4 spontaneous depolarization of the transmembrane action potential arising from a normal resting potential, reaching threshold and initiating an action potential, and that an initiating current (I f) is responsible for spontaneous phase 4 depolarization in the sinus node. In contrast, abnormal automaticity arises from a partially depolarized membrane potential that is usually close to the activation potential for calcium channels in the cell membrane, and in the acute phase of an myocardial infarction (MI) or during transient ischemia increased extracellular potassium causes partial depolarization of the resting membrane potential creating injury currents between the infarcted/ischemic tissue and healthy myocardium. These injury currents may initiate spontaneous activity.

Long QT syndrome (LQTS) risk stratification identifies high risk whenever QTc > 500 ms and extremely high when QTc > 600 ms; patients with two unequivocally pathogenic variants and a QTc > 500 ms are also at high risk, particularly if symptomatic. Overt T-wave alternans despite proper therapy is a direct sign of electrical instability and calls for preventive measures. Patients who have syncope or cardiac arrest before age 7 have a higher probability of recurrence while on beta-blockers, and those with events in the first year of life are at high risk for lethal events and may not be fully protected by traditional therapies; patients with first arrhythmic events despite full medical therapy are at higher risk. Low-risk identification includes concealed mutation-positive patients who are at low, but not zero, risk, with an estimated arrhythmic event risk around 10% between birth and age 40 in the absence of therapy; in asymptomatic genetically diagnosed LQTS, a major risk factor is exposure to drugs that block the IKr current and conditions that lower plasma potassium level.

### Kv3.1 uses a timely resurgent K (+) current to secure action potential repolarization [^111nE7TK]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

Because of their positively shifted voltage dependence of channel opening, K v 3 channels are mainly closed during rest and the AP upstroke. Therefore, they will only activate during the AP's repolarization phase. However, during brief APs, with a half-life duration as short as 100 μs, the membrane potential remains more positive than the threshold for K v 3 channel activation, that is, −10 mV, for only a very short time. This raises the possibility that the K v 3 current will be insufficient to properly repolarize the membrane. The very rapid deactivation of K v 3 channels further exacerbates this problem. Thus, the known properties of the K v 3 channels raise the question of whether enough channels can open during the brief depolarization phase of the AP to generate sufficient current to repolarize the membrane potential completely. If not, early after-depolarizations might occur, and the shape of successive APs within a pulse train might change or the train of APs could terminate early.

### Comparison of two highly automated ECG algorithms for detection of drug-induced cardiac ion channel block [^115AVV9v]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2018). Low credibility.

In 2005, the International Committee for Harmonization issued the E14 guidance requiring a thorough QT/QTc interval evaluation (TQT) for all drugs, with some exceptions, prior to regulatory approval (ICH E14). 1 Over the last 12 years, this guidance has prevented drugs that increase the risk of fatal arrhythmia, torsade de pointes ventricular tachycardia, from reaching the marketplace. However, it is now recognized that potential false‐positive QTc findings associated with this regulatory endpoint may discourage development of other beneficial and safe medications. 2 Therefore, new endpoints are being examined for regulatory consideration.

Recently the US Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Critical Path Initiative funded their own investigation of alternative ECG biomarkers for detecting cardiac ion channel block using drugs known to cause QT prolongation and associated with varying incidences of torsade risk. 3 The four drugs prospectively studied in a randomized, crossover design inhibit the human ether‐a‐go‐go‐related gene (hERG) potassium channel, I Kr, either alone or in combination with varying degrees of inhibition on the L‐type calcium, and early and late sodium inward currents. Dofetilide was chosen as a specific hERG blocker with a high incidence of torsade. 4, 5 Quinidine was also chosen as a strong hERG blocker at low concentrations but with calcium and sodium current inhibition at higher plasma concentrations. 4 The last two drugs, ranolazine and verapamil, are associated with a low risk of torsade. 6, 7 Although both are potent hERG blockers, ranolazine additionally inhibits the late sodium current, while verapamil inhibits the L‐type calcium current. 4 Using only supine resting ECGs, it was shown that, unlike QTc, early and late measures of repolarization (heart rate‐corrected global J‐T peak (c) and global T peak –T end, respectively) could differentiate pure hERG block associated with a high incidence of torsade risk, from multichannel block of hERG and either calcium or late sodium currents, which is associated with lower risk. 3

### Fast and accurate prediction of drug induced proarrhythmic risk with sex specific cardiac emulators [^115PfVAF]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Arrhythmias manifest as irregular heart rhythms stemming from abnormal cardiac electrical activity, ranging from benign palpitations to severe conditions like ventricular fibrillation. A pivotal biomarker associated with increased arrhythmic risk is a prolonged QT interval, as measured on electrocardiograms (ECGs) from the beginning of the QRS complex to the end of the T wave. The change from baseline QT, the ΔQT, is notably linked to torsades de pointes (TdP), a potentially lethal, polymorphic ventricular tachycardia. Prolongation of the QT interval, caused by many drugs beyond cardiac treatments, often arises from unintended ion channel blockades such as the hERG potassium channel, crucial for cardiac repolarization. Such blockade delays repolarization, thereby prolonging the QT interval. The gold standard for assessing the proarrhythmic risk of a drug traditionally involves measuring its effects on the hERG channel in vitro, a single-dose safety pharmacology study in dogs or monkeys, and evaluation of potential effects on the QT interval in clinical trials. Despite substantial research on this topic –, the precise relationship between drug-induced ion channel blockade at the cellular level and QT prolongation at the organ level remains poorly understood, complicating risk assessments.

Conclusions

Results of this study suggest that concentration‐response analysis of QTc and J‐T peak c can differentiate QTc prolonging drugs with predominant hERG block from drugs that have balanced ion channel block. However, small sample sizes (10 subjects) may be insufficient to characterize concentration‐response relationships for some multichannel blocking drugs.

Current regulatory guidelines from the International Council on Harmonisation (ICH) describe nonclinical (ICH S7B 1) and clinical strategies (ICH E14 2) to assess the potential of a drug to prolong cardiac repolarization as well as its clinical proarrhythmic potential. No drugs with unexpected QT prolongation or torsade de pointes (torsade) risk have reached the market after the adoption of ICH S7B and E14 guidelines. However, there are drugs that block the potassium channel encoded by the human ether‐à‐go‐go related gene (hERG) and prolong the heart rate corrected QT (QTc) interval but have low torsade risk (e.g. ranolazine, verapamil, and amiodarone) because they block other inward currents (i.e. late sodium and/or L‐type calcium currents). Block of these inward currents is anti‐arrhythmic by preventing early afterdepolarizations. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 ICH S7B and E14 discuss the importance of the drug's effects on other ion channels in addition to hERG and encourage interested parties to develop models for directly assessing drug‐induced proarrhythmia of QTc prolonging drugs. 1, 2 In line with this, the goal of the Comprehensive In Vitro Proarrhythmia Assay (CiPA) is to perform a mechanistic assessment of a drug's torsade risk. 10

Mechanisms of drug-induced TdP — ionic block, transmural heterogeneity, and trigger–substrate interaction — are described: Drugs with the potential to cause TdP most frequently inhibit the rapid component of the delayed rectifier potassium current, causing a prolonged QT interval; repolarization differs across layers with subepicardium shortest, subendocardium intermediate, and mid‑myocardium (M cells) longest, and the QT interval represents the longest M‑cell repolarization; increased transmural gradients create conditions for reentry; the immediate trigger is thought to be a premature ventricular contraction (PVC) from an early afterdepolarization, with a long preceding pause amplifying early afterdepolarizations, and initial conduction block sets up reentry that perpetuates TdP.

### How to boost efficacy of a sodium Channel blocker: the devil is in the details [^111QLP6B]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2019). Medium credibility.

The development of antiarrhythmic therapies is a costly endeavor. Computational models have increasingly been included in the drug development pipeline as a method to screen potentially proarrhythmic compounds and provide a critical link between protein scale perturbations (e.g. ion channel mutations) and tissue scale behavior (e.g. arrhythmia episodes). As experiments have more clearly elucidated ion channel dynamics, computational models too need to incorporate more detailed representations of channel responses.

The earliest models of the cardiac sodium channel (Na v 1.5) used Hodgkin-Huxley–type gating variables to reproduce the kinetics associated with channel activation and inactivation. Although these types of models can reproduce important channel properties, a key limitation is that channel activation and inactivation are assumed to be independent. Markov chain models were subsequently developed to address this limitation and to represent multiple distinct closed, open, and inactivated channel states. This framework was also critical to more accurately model drugs that target ion channels. Simply put, a drug may only access its binding site when the channel is in specific states; therefore, representing state-specific binding rates is critical. Moreno et al.previously applied such an in silico approach to explain the paradoxically proarrhythmic response of the sodium channel blocker flecainide.

Drug‑induced QT prolongation and management — many marketed cardiac and noncardiac drugs prolong ventricular repolarization and can precipitate life‑threatening ventricular tachyarrhythmias; susceptibility may relate to genetic propensity or female gender and more commonly to elevated drug blood levels from excessive dosage, renal disease, or drug interactions. If ventricular arrhythmia may be due to QT prolongation from prescribed medications, the possible offending therapies should be discontinued and follow‑up monitoring of ventricular repolarization and cardiac rhythm should be carried out.

Life-threatening malignant arrhythmias in pathophysiological conditions can increase the mortality and morbidity of patients with cardiovascular diseases. Cardiac electrical activity depends on the coordinated propagation of excitatory stimuli and the generation of action potentials in cardiomyocytes. Action potential formation results from the opening and closing of ion channels. Recent studies have indicated that small-conductance calcium-activated potassium (SK) channels play a critical role in cardiac repolarization in pathophysiological but not normal physiological conditions. The aim of this review is to describe the role of SK channels in healthy and diseased hearts, to suggest cardiovascular pathophysiologic targets for intervention, and to discuss studies of agents that target SK channels for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases.

What is Flecainide and what is its Mechanism of Action?

Flecainide is classified as a Vaughan Williams class IC antiarrhythmic that is approved in the United States by the Food and Drug Administration for the prevention and treatment of supraventricular tachycardia, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter, and ventricular tachycardia. Like all class I antiarrhythmics, flecainide exerts its therapeutic activity primarily through interactions with the cardiac sodium channel. Specifically, flecainide antagonizes fast inward voltage-gated sodium channels, slowing inward sodium movement during phase zero of cardiac depolarization. Flecainide has increased sodium channel binding at higher heart rates, a property known as "use-dependence". Overall, this effect manifests as QRS prolongation on the ECG. Flecainide dissociates from the sodium channel slowly compared with many other antiarrhythmic sodium channel blockers. Flecainide also inhibits opening of the delayed rectifier potassium channels which manifests electrocardiographically as a prolonged QT interval.

Ion channel defects — In contractile cardiomyocytes, action potentials are triggered by sodium entry producing the inward current (INa) linked to SCN5A, followed by potassium efflux via the outward current Ito initiating repolarization; the plateau reflects a balance between inward calcium currents (ICaL) through L-type calcium channels and delayed-rectifier potassium currents IKs (KCNQ1) and IKr (KCNH2), after which the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX) and SR Ca2+-ATPase restore intracellular calcium; in pacemaker cells, the funny current (If) and spontaneous SR calcium release activating NCX contribute to spontaneous depolarization, and when ion current flows are disturbed, electrical abnormalities in the form of arrhythmias occur.

Sodium channel blocker–related toxicity — recommendations include: Class I: In patients with sodium channel blocker–related toxicity, removal of the offending agent is indicated (Level of Evidence: A). Class IIa: Stopping the drug, reprogramming the pacemaker or repositioning leads can be useful in patients taking sodium channel blockers who present with elevated defibrillation thresholds or pacing requirement (Level of Evidence: C); in patients taking sodium channel blockers who present with atrial flutter with 1:1 AV conduction, withdrawal of the offending agent is reasonable, and if the drug needs to be continued, additional A‑V nodal blockade with diltiazem, verapamil, or beta blocker or atrial flutter ablation can be effective (Level of Evidence: C). Class IIb: Administration of a beta blocker and a sodium bolus may be considered for patients taking sodium channel blockers if the tachycardia becomes more frequent or more difficult to cardiovert (Level of Evidence: C).

Antiarrhythmic drug classification — uses in the acute setting are described elsewhere; drugs can be classified by the Vaughan Williams 4‑level schema (type I: fast sodium channel blockers, type II: beta blockers, type III: repolarization potassium current blockers, type IV: calcium channel antagonists) or by the more mechanistic Sicilian Gambit. The Vaughan Williams schema is somewhat outdated because drug actions do not easily fit one of the four classes and is of limited usefulness for choosing therapy; the Sicilian Gambit, introduced in 1991, attempts classification based on mechanism of action and arrhythmogenic mechanisms.

### Cardiac channelopathies: clinical diagnosis and promising therapeutics [^113nt32C]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Three possible types of BrS can be observed on an ECG. The typical type I is characterized by a J‐point elevation of ≥ 2 mm followed by a gradually descending ST segment and a negative T wave in the right precordial leads V1 and V2 at either the second, third, or fourth intercostal spaces, also called coved‐type ST‐segment elevation. Type 2, or saddleback ST segment, has a J‐point elevation of ≥ 2 mm and a terminal ST‐segment elevation of ≥ 1 mm, followed by a positive or biphasic T wave in lead V2. Type 3 also has a saddleback ST segment with a J‐point elevation of ≥ 2 mm in lead V2, but the terminal ST‐segment elevation is < 1 mm.

On top of an ECG, provocation testing is indicated in patients presenting with type 2 or 3 at baseline or those with a suspicion for BrS based on clinical or family history. In fact, type 1 may be unmasked by intravenous administration of class IA antiarrhythmic drugs such as procainamide and ajmaline, and class IC antiarrhythmic drugs such as flecainide and pilsicainide that act as sodium channel blockers. Some clinicians favor the use of ajmaline because its high sensitivity leads to a lower false‐negative rate. However, positive ajmaline tests do not necessarily confirm the diagnosis of BrS due to the potential for false positives, owing to the intricate mechanism of ajmaline. Therefore, based on the latest European Society of Cardiology guidelines, BrS diagnosis is indicated in patients without underlying heart conditions who demonstrate a spontaneous type 1 pattern on their ECG, regardless of symptoms, and in induced type 1 pattern provided there are other clinical features such as episodes of polymorphic VT/VF, arrhythmic syncope, or pertinent family history.

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of syncope (version 2009) [^111onnt7]. European Heart Journal (2009). Medium credibility.

Primary electrical diseases — syncope significance and ICD considerations: Unexplained syncope is regarded as an ominous finding in inherited cardiac ion channel abnormalities, and an ICD should be carefully considered in the absence of another competing diagnosis or when ventricular tachyarrhythmia cannot be excluded as a cause of syncope; however, syncope does not necessarily carry a high risk of major life-threatening cardiac events. In long QT syndrome, especially those with LQT2 and LQT3, the number of cardiac events before the age of 18 years, very prolonged QT intervals, and female gender predict a worse outcome, and Brugada syndrome patients with a spontaneous type 1 ECG pattern have a worse outcome than those with a type 2 or drug-induced pattern. In the largest multicentre Brugada series with ICDs, in 220 patients including 118 (88%) with a history of cardiac arrest and 88 (40%) with a history of syncope, the rates of appropriate ICD shocks were 22 and 10%, respectively, during a mean follow-up period of 38 ± 27 months.

Vasovagal syncope — natural history and treatment framing — is generally benign with clusters of syncopes interspersed with long quiescent periods without recurrences; younger and older individuals differ markedly, with the latter group more likely to have complicating comorbidities and medical therapies; despite the apparently benign profile, patients with frequent episodes occasionally need treatment, and when considering therapy it is important to weigh the natural history, potential for harm, and the marked reduction in syncope seen in all control arms of randomized trials against symptom severity and overall likelihood of treatment efficacy.

Study Highlights

WHAT IS THE CURRENT KNOWLEDGE ON THE TOPIC?

☑Drug‐induced hERG block and QTc prolongation are associated with torsade de pointes. However, there are QTc prolonging drugs that have low torsade risk because they have balanced block of inward currents (late sodium or L‐type calcium) in addition to hERG.

WHAT QUESTION DID THIS STUDY ADDRESS?

☑Can concentration‐response analysis of the J‐T peak c interval be used in small sample size studies to confirm that balanced ion channel‐blocking drugs do not prolong J‐T peak c?

WHAT DOES THIS STUDY ADD TO OUR KNOWLEDGE?

☑A lack of J‐T peak c prolongation can confirm balanced ion channel block; however, small sample size studies (10 subjects per drug) may be insufficient to characterize concentration‐response relationships in some cases.

HOW MIGHT THIS CHANGE CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY OR TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCE?

☑A comprehensive nonclinical CiPA assessment combined with assessment of the J‐T peak c interval may be able to inform the intensity of ECG monitoring in phase III trials and drug labeling for mild‐to‐moderate QTc prolonging drugs.

### Unexplained syncope: implications of age and gender on patient characteristics and evaluation, the diagnostic yield of an implantable loop recorder, and the subsequent treatment [^112uPFHJ]. Clinical Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

Patients with unexplained syncope had clinically important age‐ and gender‐related differences in their baseline characteristics and clinical presentation of syncope, how many and what kind of physicians they saw, and the type of tests they underwent. The only gender or age‐related difference in the treatments prescribed was that drug therapy for syncope was more common in women. "No specific treatment" was equally common in women and men, but was more common in patients < 65 years old. The high prevalence of an arrhythmic cause in each gender and age category may be explained by the continuous ECG monitoring during a syncope event.

Unexplained syncope was more common in patients ≥ 65 years old with no difference between men and women, possibly because a blunted response from the autonomic nervous system could make syncope from benign causes less common by increasing age. Prodromes such as palpitations, dizziness, and sweating were more common at a younger age, suggesting that the syncope episode developed more slowly in younger patients. Notably, 8% of patients with recurrent syncope had documented vasovagal and/or orthostatic mechanisms that had not been detected initially. 15

Long QT syndrome (LQTS) therapeutic implications — Beta blocker pharmacotherapy is the primary treatment for the management of most patients with LQTS. Among the three most common genotypes, beta blockers are extremely protective in LQT1 patients and moderately protective in LQT2; for LQT3, targeting the LQT3‑associated late sodium current represents the preferred pharmacotherapeutic option. Treatment planning should not rely solely on genotype or mutation because no treatment decision should be influenced solely by either genotype (LQT1‑3) or the specific LQTS‑causative mutation that was identified, and a decision to implant an implantable cardioverter‑defibrillator (ICD) prophylactically in an asymptomatic LQT3 host must include risk factors besides LQT3 genotype status.

### A molecularly detailed na1.5 model reveals a new class I antiarrhythmic target [^115Bq5jd]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Despite numerous clinical failures, antiarrhythmic drug therapy remains a cornerstone for the pharmacological management of ventricular arrhythmia. To date, all antiarrhythmic drugs are variations on a similar theme: blockade of the channel pore with varying pharmacokinetic parameters leading to varied and often unpredictable efficacy. Greer-Short et al.recently reported suppression of late current in LQT3-associated mutants by narrowing intracellular cleft separation, a mechanism that depends on the local clustering of Na + channels at the intercalated disc. However, given the current limitations and pressing need for novel therapeutic agents, we asked the question, can we use modulators of the channel other than the pore as novel drug targets to increase the dimensionality of the classic antiarrhythmic drugs?

To create our model, 2 unique LQT3 mutations were used as "guideposts", given their varied clinical responses to mexiletine. These data allowed us to integrate our experimental findings into a model of the Na + channel that is able to explicitly represent the molecular movements shown to be critical for mexiletine drug efficacy. To our knowledge, this analysis is the first such computational model to represent targetable molecular movements responsible for drug efficacy.

### Structural basis for inhibition of the cardiac sodium channel by the atypical antiarrhythmic drug ranolazine [^115FRvTC]. Nature Cardiovascular Research (2023). High credibility.

Understanding the structural basis for binding and block of Na V 1.5 by the different classes of AADs is important because these drugs have distinct clinical uses, as well as drug-specific unwanted side effects that are often life threatening, as demonstrated by the CAST trial. Our overall hypothesis for specific binding and block of Na V 1.5 by class IA, IB and IC AADs is that they share a core binding region, as defined in previous structure–function studies, but also reach out to interact with other neighboring regions of the receptor region in a drug-specific manner. The results presented here provide strong support for this hypothesis by showing that ranolazine interacts with the traditional AAD receptor in a similar fashion to class IA, IB and IC AADs but makes distinct contacts by interacting with a π-helix segment of DIV-S6, as well as with the pore helices, selectivity filter and DI. These structural results provide a molecular template for design and development of next-generation AADs with greater efficacy, specificity and safety.

Short QT syndrome (SQTS) — Clinical description, thresholds, electrophysiology, genetics, and management are summarized: Patients were reported with a persistently short QT interval (260 to 275 ms), and a QT interval shorter than 300 ms is proposed as diagnostic; families with SQTS had a QTc less than 300 ms with a QT interval less than 280 ms, and a novel form with a QTc up to 320 ms was identified. At present, it is still undefined whether diagnosis should be based on QT or QTc and which is the sensitivity and specificity of different QT/QTc interval cutoff values. Up to now, only 23 cases of SQTS from 6 different families have been reported. Electrophysiology shows that both atrial and ventricular effective refractory periods are shortened and that programmed electrical stimulation usually induces ventricular tachyarrhythmias, but whether inducibility predicts adverse clinical outcome remains unclear. Reported SQTS genes include KCNH2, KCNQ1 (in a 70-year-old man), and KCNJ2. In patients with mutation on the KCNH2 gene, it has been suggested that quinidine may be effective in suppressing inducibility at programmed electrical stimulation; for other genetic forms, the efficacy of quinidine is less clear and the use of the ICD may be considered, even if it may be associated with an increased risk of inappropriate shocks due to T-wave oversensing. Genetic analysis may help identify silent carriers of SQTS-related mutations; however, the risk of cardiac events in genetically affected individuals with a normal ECG is currently not known, and, at present, genetic analysis does not contribute to risk stratification.

### Structural basis for inhibition of the cardiac sodium channel by the atypical antiarrhythmic drug ranolazine [^112Jq7ib]. Nature Cardiovascular Research (2023). High credibility.

Voltage-gated sodium (Na V) channels generate the upstroke of the cardiac action potential by activating rapidly in response to depolarization and conducting Na + inward across the membrane. Na V 1.5 is the predominant Na V channel in the heart. It is the molecular target for class I antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs), which often have unwanted side effects, including arrhythmias. In contrast, the atypical AAD ranolazine is effective in treatment of atrial arrhythmias and angina pectoris, but with less proarrhythmia than traditional AADs –. Structures of Na V channels from prokaryotes, skeletal muscle, nerveand hearthave been determined with AADs bound within the pore to physically block Na + conductance. Here we use electrophysiology and cryogenic electron microscopy to define the interaction of ranolazine with Na V 1.5 at high resolution. We reveal ranolazine's binding pose and elucidate distinct molecular interactions that might underlie its mechanism of action and high therapeutic index relative to traditional class I AADs.

Circulation (2018). Medium credibility.

Automaticity mechanisms in ventricular arrhythmia are described as follows: normal automaticity results from phase 4 spontaneous depolarization of the transmembrane action potential arising from a normal resting potential, reaching threshold and initiating an action potential. An initiating current (I f) is responsible for spontaneous phase 4 depolarization in the sinus node. In contrast, abnormal automaticity arises from a partially depolarized membrane potential that is usually close to the activation potential for calcium channels in the cell membrane. In the acute phase of a myocardial infarction (MI) or during transient ischemia, increased extracellular potassium causes partial depolarization of the resting membrane potential creating injury currents between the infarcted/ischemic tissue and healthy myocardium, and these injury currents may initiate spontaneous activity.

### Mechanistic model-informed proarrhythmic risk assessment of drugs: review of the "CiPA" initiative and design of a prospective clinical validation study [^114dV5xu]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2018). Low credibility.

CLINICAL VALIDATION STUDY BACKGROUND AND MOTIVATION

As outlined previously, at clinically relevant concentrations, drugs that predominantly block hERG without late sodium or L‐type calcium current block (predominant hERG‐blocking drugs) cause QTc prolongation 19, 22, 40, 41 and have a high risk of TdP. However, at clinically relevant concentrations, drugs that block hERG with approximately equipotent late sodium and/or calcium current block (balanced ion channel‐blocking drugs) can cause QTc prolongation, 19, 22, 40, 41 but have a low risk of TdP. Thus, not all hERG block and QTc prolongation is associated with TdP.

Under CiPA, the initial prediction of proarrhythmic risk will come from the in silico computational model (Figure 3). CiPA will utilize an ECG assessment in early clinical phase I studies to determine if there are unexpected ion channel effects, such as effects resulting from a human‐specific metabolite or differences in protein binding, compared to the preclinical ion channel data (Figure 3). 23 As detailed previously, the CiPA phase I ECG working group identified the J‐Tpeakc as the best biomarker to differentiate balanced ion channel‐blocking drugs from predominant hERG‐blocking drugs. 39 Drugs that exhibit "balanced ion channel" effects often have QTc prolongation, but do not exhibit J‐Tpeakc prolongation. 22, 40, 41 These ECG "signatures" have been shown for multiple drugs and drug combinations blocking either hERG and late sodium or hERG and late sodium and calcium; however, the evidence is less clear for whether QTc prolongation caused by hERG and calcium block alone (with no late sodium block) exhibits J‐Tpeakc prolongation. 22, 41

### Diagnosis, management and therapeutic strategies for congenital long QT syndrome [^117KMExR]. Heart (2022). Medium credibility.

Congenital long QT syndrome (LQTS) is characterised by heart rate corrected QT interval prolongation and life-threatening arrhythmias, leading to syncope and sudden death. Variations in genes encoding for cardiac ion channels, accessory ion channel subunits or proteins modulating the function of the ion channel have been identified as disease-causing mutations in up to 75% of all LQTS cases. Based on the underlying genetic defect, LQTS has been subdivided into different subtypes. Growing insights into the genetic background and pathophysiology of LQTS has led to the identification of genotype–phenotype relationships for the most common genetic subtypes, the recognition of genetic and non-genetic modifiers of phenotype, optimisation of risk stratification algorithms and the discovery of gene-specific therapies in LQTS. Nevertheless, despite these great advancements in the LQTS field, large gaps in knowledge still exist. For example, up to 25% of LQTS cases still remain genotype elusive, which hampers proper identification of family members at risk, and it is still largely unknown what determines the large variability in disease severity, where even within one family an identical mutation causes malignant arrhythmias in some carriers, while in other carriers, the disease is clinically silent. In this review, we summarise the current evidence available on the diagnosis, clinical management and therapeutic strategies in LQTS. We also discuss new scientific developments and areas of research, which are expected to increase our understanding of the complex genetic architecture in genotype-negative patients, lead to improved risk stratification in asymptomatic mutation carriers and more targeted (gene-specific and even mutation-specific) therapies.

Classification of antiarrhythmic drugs — The Singh–Vaughan Williams classification summarized AADs in four classes: Na+ channel blockers (Class I), beta-adrenoreceptor antagonists (Class II), drugs that predominantly block K+ channels and prolong the cardiac action potential duration (APD) without affecting intracardiac conduction (Class III), and non-dihydropyridine L-type Ca2+ channel blockers (Class IV). Later, Class I AADs were subclassified into drugs with intermediate (IA), fast (IB), and slow (IC) offset kinetics of the Na+ channel blockade. This classification is widely used because it is easy to understand and it facilitates the discussion of potentially beneficial and adverse effects of AADs, but it also has limitations, including that it classifies antiarrhythmic 'actions', not 'drugs'. Most AADs can exert multiple effects on channels, receptors and pumps, and affect haemodynamics, autonomic nervous system or cardiac metabolism.

Sodium channel blockers — clinical cautions and toxicity considerations include that in large clinical trials sodium channel blockers increased mortality among patients convalescing from MI, and based on CAST flecainide is contraindicated in patients with ischemia, prior MI, and is avoided in patients with other structural heart diseases. Sodium channel blockers increase defibrillation energy requirement and pacing thresholds, so patients may require reprogramming or revision of pacing or ICD systems or changes in their medication regimens, and they can convert AF to slow atrial flutter with 1:1 atrioventricular conduction with wide QRS complexes that can be confused with VT. Procainamide and flecainide can occasionally precipitate the typical Brugada syndrome ECG, this has been reported not only with antiarrhythmic medications but also with tricyclic antidepressants and cocaine, and whether this represents unmasking or a broad spectrum of responses is unknown. In the setting of sodium-channel blocker toxicity, limited animal data suggest that administration of sodium, as sodium chloride or sodium bicarbonate, may improve conduction slowing or suppress frequent or cardioversion-resistant VT, and successful treatment with beta blockers and intravenous fat emulsion and/or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation has also been reported.

### Clinical significance and management of atrioventricular block associated with bradycardic / antiarrhythmic drug therapy: drug-induced or drug-revealed? [^112dygkj]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Notably, class Ic antiarrhythmics prolong the His‐ventricular (HV) interval, particularly when underlying infranodal conduction disease is present. Specifically, flecainide is often utilized as a drug challenge during electrophysiological studies to reveal His‐Purkinje disease in cases with a wide QRS complex, syncope, and a normal HV interval, as evidenced by a drug‐induced increase in the HV interval to more than 100 ms. Similarly, class III antiarrhythmics can also prolong the HV interval and reveal latent conduction system pathology. As far as hyperkalemia is concerned, a biphasic response has been described. Mild hyperkalemia lowers the resting membrane potential (making it less negative) more than it reduces the threshold potential. This diminishes their difference, leading to increased cellular excitability and enhanced conduction. More severe hyperkalemia further lowers the resting membrane potential, reducing the percentage of available sodium channels and decreasing the inward sodium current during phase 0 of the action potential, which leads to slower conduction velocity and increased HV interval. Consequently, hyperkalemia may unmask the presence of severe underlying conduction system disease.

Only a limited number of studies have examined and identified predictive factors for the overall need for permanent pacing, initial recovery from drug‐related and/or hyperkalemia‐related AVB, and recurrence following drug discontinuation and/or correction of hyperkalemia, often with conflicting findings. As previously mentioned, Jordan‐Martinez et al. demonstrated that in patients with drug‐related AVB, a heart rate < 35 bpm and presenting symptoms other than syncope or presyncope were associated with a higher need for permanent pacing. However, other studies have not consistently confirmed these findings. Regarding the role of QRS duration, Jordan‐Martinez et al. reported that an increased QRS duration was associated with a greater need for permanent pacing in patients with drug‐related AVB. In the same line, Kennebäck et al. suggested higher recurrence rates in patients with drug‐related AVB who had an increased QRS duration compared to those with normal QRS duration. On the contrary, Knudsen et al. did not demonstrate such an association, while Santos et al. reported that the absence of conduction abnormalities on baseline ECGs in patients with drug‐related and/or hyperkalemia‐related AVB was not associated with AVB recovery following drug discontinuation or hyperkalemia correction, nor did it predict sustained long‐term rhythm recovery.

### Assessment of multi-ion channel block in a phase I randomized study design: results of the CiPA phase I ECG biomarker validation study [^115Qx7Bo]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2019). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Drug‐induced torsade develops when there is an imbalance of inward and outward repolarization currents that triggers early afterdepolarizations. The CiPA initiative proposes to assess the effects of drugs on multiple ion channel currents (e.g. hERG, L‐type calcium, and late sodium) and integrate them in a mechanistic, in silico model of the human ventricular cardiomyocyte to predict torsade risk. The torsade risk metric (qNet) from the in silico model reflects the balance of inward and outward currents (i.e. how close a drug is to generating an early afterdepolarization, the trigger for torsade). 11 CiPA proposes to assess ECG data from early phase I clinical studies to determine if there are unexpected ion channel effects in humans compared with the results from the in vitro assays that inform the in silico model. For a balanced ion channel‐blocking drug (i.e. multichannel blocker that has a low torsade risk qNet), a lack of QTc prolongation would confirm that there are no unexpected ion channel effects. Moreover, if the balanced blocker causes QTc prolongation, a lack of J‐T peak c prolongation could confirm presence of balanced ion channel effects. Thus, presence of J‐T peak c prolongation would not be expected for balanced blockers.

### Noncanonical electromechanical coupling paths in cardiac hERG potassium channel [^115h6i9j]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

The human ether-à-go-go–related gene(hERG or KCNH2) codes for a K v channel involved in the delayed rectifier current(IK r) that determines the plateau period of the cardiac action potential. hERG malfunctions are commonly associated with severe pathologies such as long QT syndrome type 2 (LQTS-2) by loss-of-function mutations (congenital LQTS-2) or channel blockage induced by unspecific interactions with medications (acquired LQTS-2) –. These conditions have been described to promote arrhythmia and sudden death.

hERG cycles over three functional states: closed, open, and inactivated. During the peak of cardiac action potential, the channels are mostly in the inactivated state; as the membrane slowly repolarizes, they rapidly recover from inactivation, thus reopening and ceasing the action potential. hERG displays a marked inward rectification, i.e. the currents carried by the channel at depolarizing potentials are relatively small compared with the currents elicited upon repolarization. The mechanism involved in this process is due to an extremely fast pore inactivation (C-type inactivation) –, which starts before the activation process. These results suggest a possible noncanonical path that directly couples S4 movements to the C-type inactivation. It has been suggested that this mechanism might depend on a structural constriction of the Selectivity Filter (SF)even if its molecular determinants remain elusive.

### Structural basis for inhibition of the cardiac sodium channel by the atypical antiarrhythmic drug ranolazine [^116vierx]. Nature Cardiovascular Research (2023). High credibility.

Voltage-gated sodium channels in eukaryotes consist of tissue-specific high-molecular-weight pore-forming α-subunits of ~2,000 amino acid residues that contain four homologous domains (DI–DIV) –. Each domain of the α-subunit is composed of six transmembrane helices organized in two functional modules: S1–S4 form the voltage-sensing module (VS), whereas S5, S6 and the P loop between them form the pore module (PM). The VS and PM are connected by the α-helical S4–S5 linker. The intracellular linker connecting DIII and DIV serves as the fast inactivation gate, which closes the pore within 1–2 ms after opening.

The class ID antiarrhythmic drug (AAD) ranolazine blocks the cardiac voltage-gated sodium channel Na V 1.5 and is used to treat cardiac arrhythmias and angina pectoris –. Recent clinical trials show that it is effective in treatment of the increasingly common arrhythmia atrial fibrillation, both alone and in combination with the class III AADs dronedarone and amiodarone. Its mechanism of action is distinct from traditional AADs in that it preferentially blocks the late sodium current (I NaL), a small, slowly decaying component of sodium current that is increased in magnitude by genetic mutations, myocardial ischemia, congestive heart failure and other cardiac diseases. The effect of ranolazine on I NaL is approximately 10–40-fold greater than its effect on peak sodium current, even though these currents are both conducted by Na V 1.5. Understanding the structural basis for the unique pharmacological actions of ranolazine would give fresh insight into the biophysical basis for I NaL and provide a template for development of structurally related AADs of greater potency and efficacy.

Circulation (2018). Medium credibility.

Ventricular arrhythmia (VA) cellular mechanisms and substrates include enhanced normal automaticity, abnormal automaticity, triggered activity induced by early or late afterdepolarizations, and reentry. Reentry requires a trigger to initiate the arrhythmia and a substrate to sustain it, and the trigger may be a PVC, which may be due to automaticity. The substrate may be structural remodeling secondary to an underlying disease process, and often includes a scar secondary to a prior MI or surgical repair, or patchy fibrosis in the setting of cardiomyopathy or hypertrophy. Changes in ion channel or transporter function and/or expression and cell to cell coupling secondary to the underlying pathology may alter the initiation or propagation of the cardiac action potential. Enhanced automaticity or abnormal automaticity causing VA may arise from subordinate pacemaker cells in the His-Purkinje system or ventricle myocardium.

### Comparison of two highly automated ECG algorithms for detection of drug-induced cardiac ion channel block [^112gizE7]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2018). Low credibility.

In a subsequent study from the same group, 9 J‐T peak c was shown to be a stronger predictor of risk than T peak –T end. However, the consistency of J‐T peak c measurement can be undermined in the presence of notched T‐wave. It is therefore beneficial to measure J‐T peak c in a manner that maximizes its sensitivity and improves consistency. The comparison of exposure–response analysis results demonstrated that selecting the last significant peak of the T‐wave prior to its downslope results in a higher concentration slope, which increased sensitivity. This effect is also complemented with reduction of CI, which should theoretically increase specificity of the biomarker. We hypothesize that using the first peak to measure J‐T peak c, as was done by the FDA algorithm, 8 has the potential to bias a drug toward being more safe (false negative), given the hypothesis that a shorter J‐T peak c interval may offset the risk associated with QT prolongation. 3 In the absence of a gold standard, however, it is not possible to know which result is more correct without long‐term follow‐up in a large cohort of patients.
