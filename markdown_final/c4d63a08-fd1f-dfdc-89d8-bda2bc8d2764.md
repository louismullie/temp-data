## Question

How to treat pulmonary edema

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to treat pulmonary edema. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate stabilization and oxygenation. Then, I should classify the edema phenotype as cardiogenic versus noncardiogenic. Next, I will tailor therapy by phenotype, including pharmacologic and ventilatory strategies. After that, I should consider special etiologies like high-altitude pulmonary edema, negative-pressure pulmonary edema, and neurogenic pulmonary edema. Finally, I will integrate monitoring, de-escalation, and disposition planning, and I will double-check areas where evidence is mixed or evolving, such as the role of diuretics in HAPE and the comparative effectiveness of CPAP versus NIPPV in CPE.

> Let me first confirm the priorities in the first hour: secure the airway, provide supplemental oxygen to a target SpO2 ≥ 90–95%, and establish IV access while initiating continuous monitoring of SpO2, ECG, and blood pressure. I need to ensure I do not jump to conclusions about etiology before stabilizing, because hypoxemia itself can drive secondary pulmonary vasoconstriction and worsen edema, so oxygenation comes first while I gather data to distinguish cardiogenic from noncardiogenic causes [^notfound].

> Next, I should review how to classify the edema phenotype, because treatment diverges substantially. Wait, let me verify the bedside tools: lung ultrasound can rapidly detect B-lines and pleural effusions and is superior to chest radiography for early edema and effusion detection, while transthoracic echocardiography helps assess ventricular function and volume status. BNP can support a cardiogenic diagnosis but is not specific, and clinical context remains paramount, especially when ARDS and heart failure coexist [^6dc7fa69] [^a761d8a2] [^3e45d36b].

> For cardiogenic pulmonary edema, I will now examine preload and afterload reduction as first-line pharmacotherapy. High-dose IV nitrates are strongly supported to reduce filling pressures and afterload; I should titrate aggressively while watching blood pressure, and I need to remember that tachyphylaxis can occur with prolonged use, so I should plan for transition once stabilized [^77f18f75] [^58ca5c7e]. Hold on, I should verify the role of diuretics: loop diuretics like furosemide are standard for congestion relief, but they do not provide immediate hemodynamic benefit and should be used judiciously, particularly in patients with renal vulnerability or hypotension, and in combination with nitrates rather than as monotherapy in severe pulmonary edema [^4fb90928] [^d77e726e].

> I need to check the role of noninvasive ventilation in CPE. Multiple high-quality studies and meta-analyses show that CPAP or bilevel NIPPV reduces intubation and mortality compared with oxygen alone, with the clearest mortality signal for CPAP. I should initiate NIV early in moderate-to-severe cases while monitoring tolerance and hemodynamics, and I should not delay escalation if there is no rapid improvement [^197dce54] [^4b9c8965] [^b700aedb]. But wait, what if the patient is hypotensive or cannot tolerate the mask? In that scenario, I should prioritize vasodilators and consider intubation rather than forcing NIV, because hemodynamic compromise and poor mask fit reduce benefit and may worsen outcomes [^notfound].

> For noncardiogenic pulmonary edema due to ARDS, I should confirm that I am shifting to lung-protective ventilation with low tidal volumes, limiting plateau pressures, and applying adequate PEEP, while avoiding routine diuretics unless there is clear fluid overload. Prone positioning is recommended for moderate-to-severe ARDS to improve oxygenation and mortality, and I should avoid excessive fluids because positive fluid balance is associated with worse outcomes in ARDS [^f4dc7b4f] [^133b7a16]. Hold on, I should verify the diagnostic guardrails again: I need to ensure I am not missing cardiogenic edema masquerading as ARDS, so bedside echo and lung ultrasound remain essential to avoid misclassification and harmful therapy [^6dc7fa69].

> Now, let me consider high-altitude pulmonary edema, where pathophysiology and treatment differ. Descent is the single most effective intervention and should be prioritized; if descent is delayed or impossible, supplemental oxygen to maintain SpO2 > 90% is an appropriate alternative, and portable hyperbaric chambers can temporize when neither descent nor oxygen is immediately available. I should minimize exertion during descent to avoid exacerbating pulmonary hypertension [^53df88c8] [^fdda8e7f] [^347035c7]. Wait, I initially thought diuretics might help here, but I should double-check that: evidence suggests furosemide may modestly accelerate radiographic clearing without improving hard outcomes like intubation or mortality, so diuretics are not first-line in HAPE and should not replace descent or oxygen [^b53aa4de] [^aea067e0]. I also need to remember that phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors can be considered when descent and oxygen are unavailable, but they should be used cautiously and not combined with nifedipine due to hypotension risk [^ac21d637].

> For negative-pressure pulmonary edema, I should confirm that the priority is relieving the upper airway obstruction and applying positive pressure. Endotracheal intubation or a supraglottic airway restores airway patency, and CPAP or NIV with PEEP redistributes fluid and improves oxygenation. Diuretics are often unnecessary and may cause harm if the patient is intravascularly depleted, so I should avoid reflex diuresis unless there is clear fluid overload. With appropriate supportive care, NPPE typically resolves within 12–48 hours [^176b7e05] [^f1020a5b].

> Neurogenic pulmonary edema complicates acute neurologic injury and can mimic ARDS. I should treat supportively with oxygenation and lung-protective ventilation as needed, and I need to consider prone positioning in refractory cases, as case-based evidence suggests it can improve oxygenation and edema resolution. Concurrently, I must aggressively manage the underlying neurologic process, because edema resolution tracks with control of the precipitating brain injury [^d4443eee] [^d66cc076].

> Let me reconsider fluid management across phenotypes, because this is easy to misapply. In cardiogenic edema, diuretics are appropriate to relieve congestion, but in ARDS, conservative fluid strategy reduces ventilator days without increasing nonpulmonary organ failure. In HAPE, diuretics are not first-line and may be counterproductive mechanistically, so I should align fluid decisions with the underlying pathophysiology and reassess frequently with ultrasound and clinical response [^714a425b] [^b53aa4de].

> I should double-check monitoring and de-escalation plans. Serial lung ultrasound can track B-line resolution, echocardiography can reassess ventricular function, and arterial blood gases guide oxygen titration and ventilator adjustments. As oxygenation improves and work of breathing decreases, I should wean NIV or oxygen and proceed to spontaneous breathing trials when ready, while watching for recurrence of edema or deterioration suggesting a missed etiology or incomplete treatment [^6dc7fa69] [^133b7a16].

> Finally, I need to ensure disposition matches severity and trajectory. Patients with persistent hypoxemia, high ventilatory requirements, or hemodynamic instability warrant ICU-level care, whereas stable patients with clear improvement can be observed on a step-down unit or discharged with close follow-up if reliable. I should provide education on medication adherence, daily weights, and symptom triggers for cardiogenic edema, and for HAPE, counsel on gradual ascent and prophylaxis for future exposures [^notfound].

Pulmonary edema treatment is **etiology-specific and time-sensitive**: prioritize oxygenation, reduce preload/afterload for cardiogenic cases, and use lung-protective ventilation for noncardiogenic edema. Immediate oxygen to SpO2 > 90% is first-line [^fdda8e7f]; for cardiogenic edema, add IV nitrates and loop diuretics [^4fb90928], and use CPAP or NIV to reduce intubation and mortality [^197dce54] [^4b9c8965]. For ARDS, use low tidal volume ventilation with adequate PEEP and conservative fluids [^f4dc7b4f] [^133b7a16]. For HAPE, descend and give oxygen; nifedipine or a PDE-5 inhibitor if descent is delayed [^53df88c8] [^ac21d637]. Avoid routine morphine and diuretics in noncardiogenic edema, and tailor therapy to the cause and response [^c9fae3fe] [^f1020a5b].

---

## General supportive measures

- **Oxygenation**: Immediate supplemental oxygen to maintain SpO2 > 90% is essential in all forms of pulmonary edema [^fdda8e7f].

- **Positioning**: Sitting the patient upright improves oxygenation and reduces preload.

- **Monitoring**: Continuous pulse oximetry, ECG, and frequent vital signs are essential.

## Pharmacological management

Key medications by **edema type**:

| **Medication** | **Cardiogenic pulmonary edema** | **Noncardiogenic pulmonary edema (ARDS)** | **High-altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE)** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Loop diuretics (e.g. furosemide) | First-line to reduce preload and relieve congestion [^4fb90928] | Not routinely used; avoid unless fluid overload [^notfound] | Limited role; may help if fluid overload [^notfound] |
| Vasodilators (e.g. nitroglycerin, nitroprusside) | Reduce preload/afterload; rapid symptom relief [^0b645df4] | Contraindicated due to hypotension risk | Not indicated |
| Morphine | Historically used; now avoided due to respiratory depression and limited benefit [^notfound] | Not indicated | Not indicated |
| Corticosteroids | Not routine; consider if asthma/COPD exacerbation | Not indicated | Not indicated |
| Pulmonary vasodilators (e.g. nifedipine, sildenafil, tadalafil) | Not indicated | Not indicated | Use if descent delayed; reduce pulmonary artery pressure [^ac21d637] |

---

## Non-invasive ventilation (NIV)

- **Cardiogenic pulmonary edema**: CPAP or bilevel NIV reduces intubation and mortality; start early if respiratory distress [^197dce54] [^4b9c8965].

- **Noncardiogenic pulmonary edema (ARDS)**: NIV is controversial; use only if mild hypoxemia and no severe respiratory failure [^953a5d8b].

- **High-altitude pulmonary edema**: CPAP can be used if oxygen is unavailable or as adjunct [^aba09d7d].

---

## Invasive mechanical ventilation

Reserve invasive ventilation for **severe respiratory failure** or when noninvasive measures fail. Use **lung-protective strategies** — low tidal volumes (6 mL/kg PBW), adequate PEEP, and plateau pressure < 30 cm H2O — in ARDS [^f4dc7b4f] [^133b7a16].

---

## Special considerations

- **Negative pressure pulmonary edema**: Treat with oxygen, CPAP, and relief of obstruction; avoid routine diuretics [^f1020a5b].

- **Reexpansion pulmonary edema**: Supportive care, oxygen, and consider steroids in severe cases [^026f4cdb].

- **Neurogenic pulmonary edema**: Treat the underlying neurologic insult; supportive ventilation as needed [^d4443eee].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Track **oxygenation, respiratory rate, and work of breathing** to guide escalation or weaning. Obtain serial chest X-rays or lung ultrasound to assess response and detect complications [^a761d8a2]. Address the underlying cause — such as heart failure, sepsis, or altitude exposure — to prevent recurrence [^f4dc7b4f] [^53df88c8].

---

Effective pulmonary edema management hinges on **rapid etiologic diagnosis**, oxygenation, and phenotype-directed therapy: vasodilators and NIV for cardiogenic edema, lung-protective ventilation for ARDS, and descent with oxygen for HAPE.

### Update on high-altitude pulmonary edema: pathogenesis, prevention, and treatment [^2480552a]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

High-altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE) is a life-threatening noncardiogenic form of pulmonary edema (PE) that afflicts susceptible persons after rapid ascent to high altitude above 2500 m. Its pathogenesis is related to increased sympathetic tone, exaggerated hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction, uneven hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction with overperfusion of some regions of the pulmonary vascular bed, increased pulmonary capillary pressure, stress failure of pulmonary capillaries, and alveolar fluid leak across capillary endothelium resulting in interstitial and alveolar edema. Prevention of HAPE is most effectively achieved by gradual ascent with time for acclimatization, although recent small studies have highlighted a number of pharmacologic options. Inhaled salmeterol prevents HAPE presumably by increasing alveolar fluid clearance, the phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor tadalafil works by acting as a pulmonary vasodilator, and dexamethasone seems to prevent HAPE by stabilizing the capillary endothelium, along with other potential effects. These investigations have yet to be validated in widespread clinical practice. Nifedipine, which prevents HAPE via its effects as a pulmonary vasodilator, has a longer history of clinical use. The most effective and reliable treatment of established HAPE is immediate descent and/or adequate flow supplemental oxygen to maintain arterial saturation above 90%, accompanied by rest from strenuous physical activity. Use of a portable hyperbaric chamber is an effective temporizing measure, and nifedipine may be used for treatment of HAPE, although only as an adjunct to descent and/or supplemental oxygen if these methods of treatment are not immediately available to a person with HAPE.

### Assessment of pulmonary edema: principles and practice [^faac91a7]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2018). Low credibility.

Pulmonary edema increasingly is recognized as a perioperative complication affecting outcome. Several risk factors have been identified, including those of cardiogenic origin, such as heart failure or excessive fluid administration, and those related to increased pulmonary capillary permeability secondary to inflammatory mediators. Effective treatment requires prompt diagnosis and early intervention. Consequently, over the past 2 centuries a concentrated effort to develop clinical tools to rapidly diagnose pulmonary edema and track response to treatment has occurred. The ideal properties of such a tool would include high sensitivity and specificity, easy availability, and the ability to diagnose early accumulation of lung water before the development of the full clinical presentation. In addition, clinicians highly value the ability to precisely quantify extravascular lung water accumulation and differentiate hydrostatic from high permeability etiologies of pulmonary edema. In this review, advances in understanding the physiology of extravascular lung water accumulation in health and in disease and the various mechanisms that protect against the development of pulmonary edema under physiologic conditions are discussed. In addition, the various bedside modalities available to diagnose early accumulation of extravascular lung water and pulmonary edema, including chest auscultation, chest roentgenography, lung ultrasonography, and transpulmonary thermodilution, are examined. Furthermore, advantages and limitations of these methods for the operating room and intensive care unit that are critical for proper modality selection in each individual case are explored.

### Beyond pulmonary edema: diagnostic, risk stratification, and treatment challenges of acute heart failure management in the emergency department [^554da7b1]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

The majority of heart failure hospitalizations in the United States originate in the emergency department (ED). Current strategies for acute heart failure syndromes have largely been tailored after chronic heart failure guidelines and care. Prospective ED-based acute heart failure syndrome trials are lacking, and current guidelines for disposition are based on either little or no evidence. As a result, the majority of ED acute heart failure syndrome patients are admitted to the hospital. Recent registry data suggest there is a significant amount of heterogeneity in acute heart failure syndrome ED presentations, and diagnostics and therapeutics may need to be individualized to the urgency of the presentation, underlying pathophysiology, and acute hemodynamic characteristics. A paradigm shift is necessary in acute heart failure syndrome guidelines and research: prospective trials need to focus on diagnostic, therapeutic, and risk-stratification algorithms that rely on readily available ED data, focusing on outcomes more proximate to the ED visit (5 days). Intermediate outcomes (30 days) are more dependent on inpatient and outpatient care and patient behavior than ED management decisions. Without these changes, the burden of acute heart failure syndrome care is unlikely to change. This article proposes such a paradigm shift in acute heart failure syndrome care and discusses areas of further research that are necessary to promote this change in approach.

### Noncardiogenic pulmonary edema [^09f8b1ee]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Pulmonary edema is differentiated into two categories — cardiogenic and noncardiogenic. Noncardiogenic pulmonary edema is due to changes in permeability of the pulmonary capillary membrane as a result of either a direct or an indirect pathologic process. It is a spectrum of illness ranging from the less severe form of ALI to the severe ARDS. The mainstay of treatment is mechanical ventilation with maximization of ventilation and oxygenation through the judicious use of PEEP. Newer ventilation techniques, such as high-frequency oscillatory ventilation and partial fluid ventilation, are promising but are in the early stages of clinical testing. Mortality rates remain high despite increasing intensive care unit care.

### Neurogenic pulmonary edema [^d4443eee]. Critical Care Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

Neurogenic pulmonary edema is an underrecognized and underdiagnosed form of pulmonary compromise that complicates acute neurologic illness and is not explained by cardiovascular or pulmonary pathology. This review aims to provide a concise overview on pathophysiology, epidemiology, clinical characteristics, impact on outcome and treatment of neurogenic pulmonary edema, and considerations for organ donation.

Data Sources

Database searches and a review of the relevant medical literature.

Study Selection

Selected studies included English-language articles concerning neurogenic pulmonary edema using the search terms "neurogenic" with "pulmonary oedema" or "pulmonary edema", "experimental neurogenic pulmonary edema", "donor brain death", and "donor lung injury".

Data Extraction

Selected studies were reviewed by both authors, and data extracted based on author consensus regarding relevance for this review.

Data Synthesis

Existing evidence is organized to address: 1) pathophysiology, 2) epidemiology and association with different neurologic diseases, 3) clinical presentation, 4) impact on outcome, 5) treatment, and 6) implications for organ donation after brain death.

Conclusions

Neurogenic pulmonary edema occurs as a complication of acute neurologic illness and may mimic acute lung injury of other etiology. Its presence is important to recognize in patients due to its impact on clinical course, prognosis, and treatment strategies.

### Inhaled AP301 for treatment of pulmonary edema in mechanically ventilated patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome: a phase IIa randomized placebo-controlled trial [^6da932ff]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusion

In conclusion, treatment with inhaled AP301 did not reduce EVLWI and appeared to be safe in patients with mild to severe ARDS. An exploratory post-hoc subgroup analysis of SOFA strata indicated reduced EVLWI and ventilator pressures in patients with SOFA scores ≥ 11. These results need further clarification in upcoming multicenter clinical trials.

### Advances in the prevention and treatment of high altitude illness [^10af40c0]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

High altitude illness encompasses a spectrum of clinical entities to include: acute mountain sickness, high altitude cerebral edema, and high altitude pulmonary edema. These illnesses occur as a result of a hypobaric hypoxic environment. Although a mild case of acute mountain sickness may be self-limited, high altitude cerebral edema and high altitude pulmonary edema represent critical emergencies that require timely intervention. This article reviews recent advances in the prevention and treatment of high altitude illness, including new pharmacologic strategies for prophylaxis and revised treatment guidelines.

### Acute respiratory distress syndrome: diagnosis and management [^133b7a16]. American Family Physician (2020). Medium credibility.

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is noncardiogenic pulmonary edema that manifests as rapidly progressive dyspnea, tachypnea, and hypoxemia. Diagnostic criteria include onset within one week of a known insult or new or worsening respiratory symptoms, profound hypoxemia, bilateral pulmonary opacities on radiography, and inability to explain respiratory failure by cardiac failure or fluid overload. ARDS is thought to occur when a pulmonary or extrapulmonary insult causes the release of inflammatory mediators, promoting inflammatory cell accumulation in the alveoli and microcirculation of the lung. Inflammatory cells damage the vascular endothelium and alveolar epithelium, leading to pulmonary edema, hyaline membrane formation, decreased lung compliance, and decreased gas exchange. Most cases are associated with pneumonia or sepsis. ARDS is responsible for one in 10 admissions to intensive care units and one in four mechanical ventilations. In-hospital mortality for patients with severe ARDS ranges from 46% to 60%. ARDS often must be differentiated from pneumonia and congestive heart failure, which typically has signs of fluid overload. Treatment of ARDS is supportive and includes mechanical ventilation, prophylaxis for stress ulcers and venous thromboembolism, nutritional support, and treatment of the underlying injury. Low tidal volume and high positive end-expiratory pressure improve outcomes. Prone positioning is recommended for some moderate and all severe cases. As patients with ARDS improve and the underlying illness resolves, a spontaneous breathing trial is indicated to assess eligibility for ventilator weaning. Patients who survive ARDS are at risk of diminished functional capacity, mental illness, and decreased quality of life; ongoing care by a primary care physician is beneficial for these patients.

### Assessment and prevalence of pulmonary oedema in contemporary acute heart failure trials: a systematic review [^a026a233]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2015). Low credibility.

Aims

Pulmonary oedema is a common and important finding in acute heart failure (AHF). We conducted a systematic review to describe the methods used to assess pulmonary oedema in recent randomized AHF trials and report its prevalence in these trials.

Methods and Results

Of 23 AHF trials published between 2002 and 2013, six were excluded because they were very small or not randomized, or missing full-length publications. Of the remaining 17 (n = 200–7141) trials, six enrolled patients with HF and reduced ejection fraction (HF-REF) and 11, patients with both HF-REF and HF with preserved ejection fraction (HF-PEF). Pulmonary oedema was an essential inclusion criterion, in most trials, based upon findings on physical examination ('rales'), radiographic criteria ('signs of congestion'), or both. The prevalence of pulmonary oedema in HF-REF trials ranged from 75% to 83% and in combined HF-REF and HF-PEF trials from 51% to 100%. Five trials did not report the prevalence or extent of pulmonary oedema assessed by either clinical examination or chest x-ray. Improvement of pulmonary congestion with treatment was inconsistently reported and commonly grouped with other signs of congestion into a score. One trial suggested that patients with rales over > 2/3 of the lung fields on admission were at higher risk of adverse outcomes than those without.

Conclusion

Although pulmonary oedema is a common finding in AHF, represents a therapeutic target, and may be of prognostic importance, recent trials used inconsistent criteria to define it, and did not consistently report its severity at baseline or its response to treatment. Consistent and ideally quantitative, methods for the assessment of pulmonary oedema in AHF trials are needed.

### Inhaled AP301 for treatment of pulmonary edema in mechanically ventilated patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome: a phase IIa randomized placebo-controlled trial [^b7067127]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

This randomized placebo-controlled phase IIa trial is the first clinical trial reporting the use of inhaled AP301 in mechanically ventilated patients with ARDS. The total number of adverse events was no different between the treatment groups. In addition, all adverse events could be explained by the course of the underlying diseases and the severity of the critical illness.

The comparison of primary and secondary endpoints between the treatment groups did not differ in this small phase IIa study. An exploratory post-hoc subgroup analysis indicated reduced EVLWI in patients with SOFA scores ≥ 11 receiving treatment with inhaled AP301.

We stratified patients prior to randomization by SOFA score to ensure equal distribution of patients according to the severity of the underlying disease to the both treatment arms. With this approach we aimed to avoid an uneven distribution of severity of extrapulmonary organ failure between the treatment groups due to variances in severity of illness. A cut-off value of SOFA score ≥ 11 was chosen to reflect the increased in-hospital mortality at SOFA scores ≥ 11.

To better understand if treatment response differed in patients with distinct severity of illness, we performed a post-hoc exploratory subgroup analysis of the SOFA score strata. We observed a reduction in EVLWI and ventilation pressures over 7 days together with a trend of more ventilator-free days in patients with initial SOFA scores ≥ 11 who received AP301. No treatment effect of AP301 was observed in patients with SOFA scores ≤ 10 at screening. These differences between the patients stratified according to severity of illness (SOFA score strata) may have several explanations. Owing to a small sample size, less severely ill patients (stratum A) may have had a profile that precluded a benefit from AP301. By chance, all three patients with burn injuries in the study were randomized to AP301 treatment in stratum A. Two of these patients did not exhibit a reduction in EVLWI over 7 days of treatment. Another explanation for the absence of a treatment effect in stratum A may be that patients with less severe critical illness might present with transient reductions in arterial oxygenation that are easily reversed and that are not due to pulmonary inflammation, resulting in AP301 ineffectiveness.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines for the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of acute altitude illness: 2024 update [^f4affbe7]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

To provide guidance to clinicians about best practices, the Wilderness Medical Society (WMS) convened an expert panel to develop evidence-based guidelines for prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of acute mountain sickness, high altitude cerebral edema, and high altitude pulmonary edema. Recommendations are graded based on the quality of supporting evidence and the balance between the benefits and risks/burdens according to criteria put forth by the American College of Chest Physicians. The guidelines also provide suggested approaches for managing each form of acute altitude illness that incorporate these recommendations as well as recommendations on how to approach high altitude travel following COVID-19 infection. This is an updated version of the original WMS Consensus Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Acute Altitude Illness published in Wilderness &amp; Environmental Medicine in 2010 and the subsequently updated WMS Practice Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Acute Altitude Illness published in 2014 and 2019.

### Management of swimming-induced pulmonary edema… [^b22ed4b6]. AAFP (2004). Low credibility.

to the editor: A healthy 20-year-old United States Navy search and rescue swimmer trainee, who was equipped with only a mask and fins, developed hemoptysis, sharp substernal chest pain, and shortness of breath after performing a dive to a depth of 12 feet. He immediately surfaced and began to cough up pink, frothy sputum and have persistent shortness of breath. His initial oxygen saturation was 70 percent on room air and improved to 86 percent on three liters of oxygen via nasal cannula during ambulance transfer. On arrival at the emergency department, the patient had an oxygen saturation of 100 percent on three liters of oxygen with improved shortness of breath and resolved hemoptysis. 1 Cold-water immersion is instrumental in this process because the peripheral vasculature constricts to divert blood away from the extremities in an effort to maintain the core body temperature.

This results in a central pooling of blood, leading to an increased preload, increased pulmonary artery pressure, and an increased cardiac output. The vasoconstriction also causes an increase in afterload, which leads to an increase in pulmonary vasculature resistance. The increased cardiac output from exertional activities coupled with an increased preload and afterload from immersion appear to be sufficient to rupture the pulmonary capillary membranes, thus resulting in pulmonary edema. In several documented cases of SIPE, it has been noted that the patients consumed anywhere from two to four liters of water in the hours leading up to their swim in an effort to remain well hydrated. 2 It is believed that this degree of hydration led to a fluid overload that contributed to the onset of pulmonary edema by increasing the pulmonary capillary pressure.

2 Patients may present with symptoms, such as cough, dyspnea, hemoptysis, tachypnea, and confusion with hypoxia, after exertional cold water activity such as swimming and scuba diving.
3. Treatment for patients with SIPE consists primarily of supportive measures such as removing the patient from the wet and/or cold environment and providing supplemental oxygen. Although useful in treating pulmonary edema in racehorses, diuretics are typically not necessary because patients tend to show relief of symptoms soon after being placed on supplemental oxygen. 4 Full resolution of radiographic findings typically occurs within 24 to 48 hours.

### Inhaled AP301 for treatment of pulmonary edema in mechanically ventilated patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome: a phase IIa randomized placebo-controlled trial [^7c0b4897]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Although fluid management was left to the discretion of the treating physicians and we did not use a standardized treatment protocol, the observed effects on EVLWI could not be explained by differences in fluid balance.

Our study has several limitations. The treatment intervention was added to standard of care for patients with ARDS at the Vienna General Hospital. Protocols for ventilation and weaning or handling of diuretic therapy were not strictly defined in the study protocol, and the treatment depended on the decisions of treating physicians and staff who were by design not involved in conduct of the study. Another major limitation is that this small study included a heterogeneous population of patients with ARDS caused by various clinical conditions, and it was not adequately powered to identify differences in important outcome parameters such as length of ICU stay or survival.

Besides one AE (episode of decreased tidal volume during mechanical ventilation) after AP301 inhalation, no safety concerns attributable to the study drug were observed. Most AEs represent common complications in critically ill patients with ARDS, or they were caused by underlying diseases or preexisting comorbidities, precluding a relationship to the study therapy. Mortality did not differ between the treatment groups, peaking at 30% in the AP301 group, which is the observed mortality rate of ARDS according to the literature. Of note, two patients with 60% burn injury, which is associated with an even higher mortality rate, were included in the AP301 group. Considering all details of the patients' case histories, the five fatal cardiac arrests in the AP301 group were not related to the study therapy. Three of these patients died following the decision to limit intensive care support due to futility. The causes of cardiac arrest in the other two patients were myocardial infarction and multiorgan failure in a patient with 60% burn injury, respectively. Only one cardiac arrest occurred within the active treatment period, but study treatment was stopped 2 days before the event owing to the patient's unstable condition.

Of note, in a large clinical trial of the ARDS network, 79% of patients who died had a "do not resuscitate" order. In the present study, 50% of patients who died within 28 days had an order to "allow natural death", including four patients in the AP301 group and one patient in the placebo group.

### Causes and treatment of oedema in patients with heart failure [^6455a61d]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2013). Medium credibility.

Oedema is one of the fundamental features of heart failure, but the pathophysiology of oedema varies. Patients present along a spectrum ranging from acute pulmonary oedema to gross fluid retention and peripheral oedema (anasarca). In patients with pure pulmonary oedema, the problem is one of acute haemodynamic derangement; the patient does not have excess fluid, but pulmonary venous pressure rises such that the rate of fluid transudation into the interstitium of the lung exceeds the capacity of the pulmonary lymphatics to drain away the fluid. Conversely, in patients with peripheral oedema, the problem is one of fluid retention. Understanding the causes of oedema will enable straightforward, correct management of the condition. For patients with acute pulmonary oedema, vasodilatation is important to reduce cardiac filling pressures. For patients with fluid retention, removing the fluid, using either diuretics or mechanical means, is the most important consideration.

### Swimming-induced pulmonary edema: evaluation of prehospital treatment with CPAP or positive expiratory pressure device [^35e1a875]. Chest (2022). Medium credibility.

Take-home Points

Study Question: Is noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) a feasible and safe prehospital treatment for swimming-induced pulmonary edema?

Results: Most patients (91%) could be discharged safely after a median of 10 to 20 min of NPPV treatment on site.

Interpretation: NPPV, administered as CPAP ventilation or by a positive expiratory pressure device, proved feasible and safe as prehospital treatment for swimming-induced pulmonary edema.

FOR EDITORIAL COMMENT, SEE

Swimming-induced pulmonary edema (SIPE) occurs in predominantly healthy individuals during swimming in cold open water. Symptoms consist of dyspnea, cough, or hemoptysis together with hypoxemia and findings of crackles on pulmonary auscultation. Pulmonary edema in patients with SIPE has been visualized by radiograph or CT scan, but also been confirmed in prehospital settings by point-of-care lung ultrasound (LUS). Although the pathophysiologic features are not understood fully, SIPE is considered a hydrostatic edema with high pulmonary capillary transmural pressure. The proposed mechanism is a combination of central pooling of blood and increased left ventricular afterload resulting from immersion in cold water, increased pulmonary capillary pressure during physical exercise, and negative intrathoracic pressures during head-out water immersion in susceptible individuals. Consequently, SIPE usually resolves spontaneously within 24 to 48 h after removal of the patient from water and rest, but occasionally may be life-threatening. The optimal strategy for treatment of SIPE is unknown. Based on pathophysiologic characteristics, noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) could be a favorable treatment. Interestingly, other than a pilot study published by our research group in 2016, we could find only seven cases of patients treated with NPPV for SIPE in the literature.

### A national model for developing, implementing, and evaluating evidence-based guidelines for prehospital care [^c9fae3fe]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

Respiratory distress (includes Bronchospasm, Pulmonary Edema) — prehospital pulmonary edema management states that nitroglycerin reduces left ventricular filling pressure primarily via venous dilation and at higher doses variably lowers systemic afterload and increases stroke volume and cardiac output; diuretics such as furosemide provide no immediate benefit for most patients and can cause significant harm with increased morbidity and mortality in patients with other disease processes; nitrates provide both subjective and objective improvement and might decrease intubation rates, incidence of MIs, and mortality, with high-dose nitrates reducing both preload and afterload and potentially increasing cardiac output and blood pressure; if available and trained, ultrasound is useful to distinguish pulmonary edema from other causes of respiratory distress (including pneumothorax); pulmonary edema due to irritant gas inhalation generally is best managed by supportive care and escalation of airway interventions once the patient is appropriately decontaminated, and early poison center consultation should be strongly considered for guidance; pulmonary edema due to high altitude should be managed as described in Altitude Illness Guideline.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines for the prevention and treatment of acute altitude illness: 2019 update [^ac21d637]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2019). High credibility.

High-altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE) pharmacotherapy — there is a strong physiologic rationale for phosphodiesterase inhibitors because they cause pulmonary vasodilation and decrease pulmonary artery pressure, but no systematic study has examined tadalafil or sildenafil in HAPE as mono- or adjunctive therapy; combined use of nifedipine and sildenafil or tadalafil should be avoided due to risk of hypotension. Recommendation: Tadalafil or sildenafil can be used for HAPE treatment when descent is impossible or delayed, access to supplemental oxygen or portable hyperbaric therapy is impossible, and nifedipine is unavailable (Recommendation Grade: 2C).

### A structured diagnostic algorithm for patients with ARDS [^6dc7fa69]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis of ARDS

The diagnosis of ARDS is largely based on hypoxic respiratory failure and the detection of pulmonary edema, from which hydrostatic cardiogenic pulmonary edema must be excluded. It is therefore essential that false positive results are excluded as much as possible by means of non-invasive imaging. Ultrasound of the lungs is superior to chest X-ray for detecting and ruling out pleural effusion. The chest X-ray can give the illusion that the lung is consolidated when there is a large effusion and this can result in a false positive diagnosis, but the treatment differs. Transthoracic ultrasound of the heart can facilitate the diagnosis of acute heart failure. In general, acute heart failure is sufficient explanation for pulmonary edema and treatment should be focused on decongestion. However, a complicating factor is that cardiomyopathy due to a hyperinflammatory state can be associated with ARDS (and thus non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema). Usually, these are patients with sepsis, with a high a priori risk of ARDS who should also be diagnosed with ARDS.

Practical steps

Determine that the patient meets the ARDS criteria according to the 'Berlin definition' and report the diagnosis of ARDS in the status (Table 1), both when the cause is evident and when the cause is unclear, as ARDS is a descriptive — and not causal — diagnosis. The presence of ARDS should trigger both a standardized set of evidence-based interventions (e.g. lung protective ventilation, restrictive fluid therapy) and, importantly, an investigation into the cause of the pulmonary injury.
Perform ultrasound of the lungs to rule out pulmonary effusion as the cause for the bilateral consolidations. Finding pleural abnormalities with lung ultrasound strongly suggests an inflammatory cause of the pulmonary edema.
Perform transthoracic cardiac ultrasound to exclude acute heart failure as a cause of pulmonary edema. Ultrasound evidence of cardiomyopathy does not exclude ARDS in an underlying condition with a high pre-probability of ARDS (such as sepsis) and in this case ARDS should be diagnosed despite the contribution of acute heart failure to the onset of pulmonary edema.

### A systematic review of diagnostic methods to differentiate acute lung injury / acute respiratory distress syndrome from cardiogenic pulmonary edema [^3e45f36b]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusions

We found that there were no identified biomarkers or tools with high-quality evidence for differentiating ALI/ARDS from CPE. Because there is no objective "gold standard" for diagnosing ALI/ARDS or CPE, a clear distinction between ALI/ARDS and CPE may not have been possible in any of these reported studies. The eventual diagnosis was determined by post hoc expert review, blinded to target marker. These limitations pose an obstacle to developing a reliable method to differentiate these disorders. However, differentiating the cause of pulmonary edema is important because the therapy of ALI/ARDS and CPE are fundamentally different. Although fluid restriction might be used to treat both CPE and ARDS/ALI, early recognition of ALI/ARDS allows an emphasis on lung-protective ventilation and in the treatment of the underlying cause of the ARDS whilst recognition of CPE may lead to the appropriate use of diuretics, inotropic therapy, and afterload reduction. Combining clinical criteria with validated biomarkers may improve the predictive accuracy and improve the outcomes of ALI/ARDS even it co-exists with CPE.

### Modern management of cardiogenic pulmonary edema [^10627c08]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

Cardiogenic pulmonary edema (CPE) is a life-threatening condition that is frequently encountered in standard emergency medicine practice. Traditionally, diagnosis was based on physical assessment and chest radiography and treatment focused on the use of morphine sulfate and diuretics. Numerous advances in diagnosis and treatment have been made, however. Serum testing for B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) has improved the accuracy of diagnoses in these patients. Treatment should focus on fluid redistribution with aggressive preload and afterload reduction rather than simply on diuresis. Some specific medications and noninvasive positive pressure ventilation have been shown to be safe and rapidly effective in improving patients' symptoms and improve outcomes.

### An orally active TRPV4 channel blocker prevents and resolves pulmonary edema induced by heart failure [^8bf7cc64]. Science Translational Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Pulmonary edema resulting from high pulmonary venous pressure (PVP) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in heart failure (HF) patients, but current treatment options demonstrate substantial limitations. Recent evidence from rodent lungs suggests that PVP-induced edema is driven by activation of pulmonary capillary endothelial transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) channels. To examine the therapeutic potential of this mechanism, we evaluated TRPV4 expression in human congestive HF lungs and developed small-molecule TRPV4 channel blockers for testing in animal models of HF. TRPV4 immunolabeling of human lung sections demonstrated expression of TRPV4 in the pulmonary vasculature that was enhanced in sections from HF patients compared to controls. GSK2193874 was identified as a selective, orally active TRPV4 blocker that inhibits Ca(2+) influx through recombinant TRPV4 channels and native endothelial TRPV4 currents. In isolated rodent and canine lungs, TRPV4 blockade prevented the increased vascular permeability and resultant pulmonary edema associated with elevated PVP. Furthermore, in both acute and chronic HF models, GSK2193874 pretreatment inhibited the formation of pulmonary edema and enhanced arterial oxygenation. Finally, GSK2193874 treatment resolved pulmonary edema already established by myocardial infarction in mice. These findings identify a crucial role for TRPV4 in the formation of HF-induced pulmonary edema and suggest that TRPV4 blockade is a potential therapeutic strategy for HF patients.

Acute Left Ventricular Failure

Acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema is a self‐evident clinical condition with short‐term resolution in most patients and is another clinical condition that does not have its management primarily oriented by BP values. The management is based on the physiopathology of the syndrome and the clinical experience. BP is elevated in many patients, particularly those with hypertensive cardiomyopathy, because of the sympathetic discharge promoted by hypoxemia and the fear of imminent death. The rationale for treatment indicates drugs that reduce preload and afterload, such as nitrates.

Guidelines for managing heart failure superficially address on the management of acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema, a condition that was specifically focused by a complementary statement from the European Society of Cardiology. It recommends vasodilators, preferentially nitrates, and oxygen and loop diuretics as the first step for treatment. Pulmonary edema secondary to acute left ventricular failure is another clinical condition that does not have its management primarily oriented by BP values in most patients.

### Nesiritide treatment of noncardiogenic pulmonary edema [^c387d313]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To report the efficacy of nesiritide in treating noncardiogenic pulmonary edema.

Case Summary

A 50-year-old African American woman with a complex medical history including morbid obesity, acute bronchitis, obstructive sleep apnea, hypertension, and numerous hospitalizations for volume overload presented to the emergency department with severe dyspnea. A portable chest X-ray displayed perihilar congestion and bilateral pulmonary edema. An echocardiogram demonstrated normal left-ventricular systolic and diastolic function. She was aggressively treated with nitrates, diuretics, bronchodilators, and oxygen. Despite these efforts, the patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) continued to show respiratory acidosis, the oxygen saturation was significantly depressed, and the dyspnea continued. Since standard therapies were failing after 12 hours, the patient was treated with intravenous nesiritide. The results were profound in terms of rapid symptomatic and prognostic improvement (i.e. ABG) beginning within 45 minutes of administration, and the patient was discharged after a 5-day hospital course.

Discussion

Nesiritide is a human B-type natriuretic peptide that has been shown to improve hemodynamic function and symptoms associated with decompensated heart failure. This is primarily due to the actions of this medication, including diuresis, decreased mean arterial pressure, and improvement of pulmonary arterial occlusion pressure as determined by published clinical trial outcomes. This case describes the use of nesiritide as an effective adjunctive therapy in treating a patient with noncardiogenic pulmonary edema.

Conclusions

Nesiritide appears to be an efficacious treatment for acute pulmonary edema, resistant to standard-of-care therapies, in the presence of normal left-ventricular function.

### Understanding negative pressure pulmonary edema [^f1020a5b]. Intensive Care Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Treatment of NPPE generally includes maintaining a patent airway, and oxygen supplementation with addition of positive end-expiratory pressure or noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIV) as guided by physical examination and arterial blood gas analysis. Mechanical ventilation should be reserved for severe patients who do not respond to NIV. Diuretics are often used; however, there is no evidence of their utility, and they may exacerbate hypovolemia and hypoperfusion. Ultimately, NPPE usually has a rapidly resolving clinical course in 12–48 h when recognized early and treated immediately.

Understanding the pathophysiological mechanisms contributing to PE can help in distinguishing NPPE from other causes of noncardiogenic PE, thus preventing use of inappropriate and dangerous treatment for patients with NPPE.

Additional analyses

In an exploratory subgroup analysis of SOFA score strata, there were no differences in EVLWI or secondary outcomes between treatment groups in stratum A. Interestingly, in stratum B, the mean baseline-adjusted change in EVLWI between screening and day 7 was higher in patients treated with AP301 (3.6 ± 3.7 mL/kg PBW) than in those treated with placebo (0.4 ± 3.4 mL/kg PBW; p = 0.04). Furthermore, we observed a reduction in peak ventilation pressure (p = 0.018), plateau pressure (p = 0.01), PEEP (p = 0.022), and mean airway pressure (p = 0.01) in patients treated with AP301 versus placebo in stratum B. Patients inhaling AP301 in stratum B had 21 (IQR 15–21) ventilator-free days versus 11 (IQR 0–17) days in the placebo group (p = 0.06). This trend started within the first week. Four patients were extubated between days 4 and 7 in the AP301 group whereas one patient was extubated on day 7 in the placebo group.

### Acute respiratory distress syndrome: potential of therapeutic interventions effective in treating progression from COVID-19 to treat progression from other illnesses-a systematic review [^66d57324]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

The COVID-19 pandemic has shone light on the inadequate treatment options for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Within the United Kingdom (UK), 12.5% of intensive care unit admissions meet ARDS criteria, and in the United States of America (USA), ARDS affects around 150 000to 200 000people annually. ARDS is the most severe form of acute lung injury (ALI)and is characterised by inflammatory damage to the alveolar-capillary membrane, increasing capillary permeability, leading to oedema in the alveoli and lung interstitium. The initial damage can be direct via pneumonia, pulmonary infection or aspiration, or indirect via sepsis, drug toxicity, blood transfusions or non-pulmonary major trauma. Following activation of a local inflammatory response, the release of proinflammatory cytokines promotes further damage to the lungs.

### Non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (CPAP or bilevel NPPV) for cardiogenic pulmonary edema [^4b9c8965]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) has been widely used to alleviate signs and symptoms of respiratory distress due to cardiogenic pulmonary edema. NPPV prevents alveolar collapse and helps redistribute intra-alveolar fluid, improving pulmonary compliance and reducing the pressure of breathing.

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness and safety of NPPV in the treatment of adult patients with cardiogenic pulmonary edema.

Search Strategy

We undertook a comprehensive search of the following databases in April 2005: CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, DARE and LILACS. We also reviewed reference lists of included studies and contacted experts, equipment manufacturers, and the Cochrane Heart Group. We did not apply language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We selected blinded or unblinded randomized or quasi-randomized clinical trials, reporting on adult patients with acute or acute-on-chronic cardiogenic pulmonary edema and where NPPV (continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)) and/or bilevel NPPV plus standard medical care was compared with standard medical care alone.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently selected articles and abstracted data using a standardized data collection form. We evaluated study quality with emphasis on allocation concealment, adherence to the intention-to-treat principle and losses to follow-up.

Main Results

We included 21 studies involving 1,071 participants. Compared to standard medical care, NPPV significantly reduced hospital mortality (RR 0.6, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.84) and endotracheal intubation (RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.83) with numbers needed to treat of 13 and 8, respectively. We found no difference in hospital length of stay with NPPV, however, intensive care unit stay was reduced by 1 day (WMD -1.07 days, 95% CI -1.60 to -0.53). Compared to standard medical care, we did not observe significant increases in the incidence of acute myocardial infarction with NPPV during (RR 1.24, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.95) or after (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.09 to 7.54) its application.

Authors' Conclusions

NPPV, especially CPAP, in addition to standard medical care is an effective and safe intervention for the treatment of adult patients with acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema.

Mixed Meta‐Analysis for the Primary Outcomes

The network map involved 5 treatments. (Figure 1A shows the map for CI‐AKI, whereas Figure 1B the map for pulmonary edema.) The number of studies for each direct comparison ranged from 1 to 3 in the case of CI‐AKI and from 1 to 2 for pulmonary edema. Fixed‐rate hydration was used as common comparator for both outcomes. Figure 2A presents the league tables for CI‐AKI and pulmonary edema. Network meta‐analysis showed that UFR‐guided (OR, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.19–0.54) and CVP‐guided (OR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.21–0.97) hydration strategies were more efficacious than fixed hydration in preventing CI‐AKI.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^87fb192a]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Heart failure in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) — prevalence and management: The prevalence of systolic or diastolic heart failure in COPD patients ranges from 20% to 70%, and its annual incidence is between 3–4%. Incident heart failure is a significant and independent predictor of all-cause mortality. Unrecognized heart failure may mimic or accompany acute COPD; 40% of COPD patients that are mechanically ventilated because of hypercapnic respiratory failure have evidence of left ventricular dysfunction. Treatment with β1-blockers improves survival in heart failure and is recommended in patients with heart failure who also have COPD. Selective β1-blockers should be used, and only used, to treat people with COPD for approved cardiovascular indications; not solely for the purpose of preventing exacerbations of COPD. Acute heart failure should be treated according to usual heart failure guidelines since there is no evidence to support an alternative management strategy, and noninvasive ventilation added to conventional therapy improves outcomes for patients with either hypercapnic respiratory failure due to an exacerbation of COPD as well as heart failure with acute pulmonary edema.

This conference brought together experts on noninvasive ventilation (NIV) to discuss and debate the advances in evidence and technology over the past decade. A major impetus for the conference was that many institutions have not systematically integrated NIV into their clinical practice, despite mounting, high-level evidence supporting its effectiveness. NIV clearly improves outcomes for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema when instituted as a first-line therapy. Although the evidence is less persuasive, initial intervention with NIV also might benefit a carefully selected subset of patients with acute lung injury, as well as those with acute respiratory failure who are immunocompromised. The papers in this and last month's special issue of the Journal provide an informative guide for clinicians attempting to implement NIV in their institutions. This paper summarizes the major findings from each presentation and the discussions that followed.

### The International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation guidelines for the management of pediatric heart failure (update from 2014) [^f9f6be47]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2025). High credibility.

Pediatric acute heart failure — respiratory support: Children with acute HF often require respiratory support to improve oxygenation and reduce respiratory distress. Invasive ventilation is recommended for children with acute HF and respiratory failure (Class I, Level of Evidence C). Noninvasive ventilation is reasonable for the treatment of children with acute HF, pulmonary edema, and significantly increased work of breathing (in the presence or absence of pulmonary edema) as an adjunct to other medical therapies (Class IIa, Level of Evidence C).

### Negative-pressure pulmonary edema [^176b7e05]. Chest (2016). Low credibility.

Negative-pressure pulmonary edema (NPPE) or postobstructive pulmonary edema is a well-described cause of acute respiratory failure that occurs after intense inspiratory effort against an obstructed airway, usually from upper airway infection, tumor, or laryngospasm. Patients with NPPE generate very negative airway pressures, which augment transvascular fluid filtration and precipitate interstitial and alveolar edema. Pulmonary edema fluid collected from most patients with NPPE has a low protein concentration, suggesting hydrostatic forces as the primary mechanism for the pathogenesis of NPPE. Supportive care should be directed at relieving the upper airway obstruction by endotracheal intubation or cricothyroidotomy, institution of lung-protective positive-pressure ventilation, and diuresis unless the patient is in shock. Resolution of the pulmonary edema is usually rapid, in part because alveolar fluid clearance mechanisms are intact. In this review, we discuss the clinical presentation, pathophysiology, and management of negative-pressure or postobstructive pulmonary edema.

### The use of noninvasive ventilation in emergency department patients with acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema: a systematic review [^bdbb4740]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Study Objective

Acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema is a common cause of respiratory distress in emergency department (ED) patients. Noninvasive ventilation by noninvasive positive pressure ventilation or continuous positive airway pressure has been studied as a treatment strategy. We critically evaluate the evidence for the use of noninvasive ventilation on rates of hospital mortality and endotracheal intubation.

Methods

We searched the databases of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library from 1980 to 2005. Additional sources included key journals, bibliographies of selected articles, and expert contact. We included studies that incorporated a randomized design; patients older than 18 years and with acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema; diagnosis and treatment initiated in the ED; noninvasive ventilation in addition to standard medical therapy compared to standard medical therapy alone, or noninvasive positive pressure ventilation compared to continuous positive airway pressure (both in addition to standard medical therapy); and data on hospital mortality or intubation. A random-effects model was used to obtain the summary risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for hospital mortality and intubation.

Results

A pooled analysis of 494 patients suggested that noninvasive ventilation in addition to standard medical therapy significantly reduced hospital mortality compared to standard medical therapy alone (RR 0.61; [95% CI 0.41, 0.91]). Similarly, a meta-analysis of 436 patients suggested that noninvasive ventilation was associated with a significant decrease in intubation rates (RR 0.43; [95% CI 0.21, 0.87]).

Conclusion

Our results suggest that noninvasive ventilation with standard medical therapy is advantageous over standard medical therapy alone in ED patients with acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema. Future studies, powered appropriately for mortality and intubation rates, are necessary to confirm these findings.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines for the prevention and treatment of acute altitude illness: 2019 update [^8fa5f782]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Concurrent high-altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE) and high-altitude cerebral edema (HACE) — treatment approach emphasizes adding dexamethasone for patients with concurrent HAPE and HACE, including when neurologic dysfunction in HAPE does not resolve rapidly with supplemental oxygen and improved oxygen saturation. If supplemental oxygen is not available, dexamethasone should be started in addition to HAPE medications in patients with altered mental status and/or suspected concurrent HACE. Nifedipine or other pulmonary vasodilators may be used with care to avoid lowering mean arterial pressure because this may decrease cerebral perfusion pressure and increase the risk for cerebral ischemia.

### A change of position for neurogenic pulmonary edema [^d66cc076]. Neurocritical Care (2009). Low credibility.

Introduction

Stroke is the third most common cause of death in the Western World and is a condition seen by Neurologists, General Physicians and Primary Care Physicians. Neurogenic pulmonary edema can complicate the management of large strokes and cerebral hemorrhage. While the principles of management of this type of pulmonary edema are similar to the more common cardiogenic pulmonary edema, placing a patient in the prone position may be a helpful maneuver facilitating recovery.

Methods

We describe a case of basilar thrombosis treated with intra-arterial thrombolysis where prone ventilation was employed to treat neurogenic cardio-pulmonary complications.

Results

This resulted in rapid resolution of neurogenic pulmonary edema and patient recovery after recanulation of the basilar artery by intra-arterial urokinase.

Conclusion

This technique of prone positioning for ventilation is of importance to physicians who manage stroke and its complications.

### Frequency of edema in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension receiving ambrisentan [^94c9aa29]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

Edema is a common side effect of endothelin receptor antagonists. Ambrisentan is an endothelin type A-selective endothelin receptor antagonist approved for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension. We examined the clinical outcomes of patients who developed edema with and without ambrisentan treatment in 2 phase III, randomized placebo-controlled trials, ambrisentan for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension: results of the ambrisentan in pulmonary arterial hypertension, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, efficacy (ARIES) study 1 and 2 (ARIES-1 and ARIES-2) (n = 393). Edema-related adverse events were extracted using broad adverse event search terms. The present post hoc analysis included 132 placebo patients and 261 ambrisentan patients. Of these patients, 14% of the placebo patients and 23% of the ambrisentan patients experienced edema-related adverse events. Overall, the patients who experienced edema tended to have a worse baseline World Health Organization (WHO) functional class (edema 76%, WHO functional class III-IV; no edema 56%, WHO functional class III-IV). In the ambrisentan patients, those with edema were older (mean age 58 ± 13 years) and heavier (mean weight 75 ± 19 kg) than those without edema (mean age 49 ± 15 years; mean weight 70 ± 17 kg). At week 12 of treatment, the ambrisentan patients had significantly increased their 6-minute walk distance (6MWD) by 34.4 m compared to the placebo patients in whom the 6MWD had deteriorated by -9.0 m (p < 0.001). Among the ambrisentan patients, those without edema had a 6MWD increase of 38.9 m and those with edema had a 6MWD increase of 19.4 m. Ambrisentan significantly improved the brain natriuretic peptide levels by -34% compared to the brain natriuretic peptide levels in the placebo group that had worsened by +11% (p < 0.001). Ambrisentan reduced the brain natriuretic peptide concentrations similarly in patients with and without edema. In conclusion, the present subanalysis of patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension has revealed that ambrisentan therapy provides clinical benefit compared to placebo, even in the presence of edema.

### Effect of furosemide in the treatment of high-altitude pulmonary edema [^b53aa4de]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The findings of this study indicate that although the use of furosemide can accelerate the absorption of lung infiltrates in patients with HAPE. However, the clinical implications of these improvements in imaging findings on prognosis are still unclear, possibly due to the limited number of cases. It does not have a significant impact on reducing the length of hospital stay and in-hospital mortality.

HAPE is a non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema and differs from cardiogenic pulmonary edema, such as congestive heart failure. Cardiogenic pulmonary edema occurs when heart disease leads to a weakened pumping function of the heart or an excessive cardiac load, resulting in pulmonary congestion and increased pulmonary capillary pressure, ultimately causing fluid leakage into the lungs. Diuretics are commonly used medications for treating congestive heart failure, as they promote urine excretion to reduce fluid retention in the body and alleviate pulmonary edema symptoms. However, HAPE is caused by factors such as thin air at high altitudes and pulmonary vasoconstriction. Pulmonary vasoconstriction is associated with increased pulmonary vascular resistance and pulmonary artery pressure in patients. These changes result in an increase in pulmonary capillary hydrostatic pressure, followed by fluid leakage from the vascular space into the interstitium and alveolar spaces. Diuretics have limited effectiveness in treating HAPE, possibly due to the different pathogenesis of HAPE compared to congestive heart failure, and their limited ability to improve pulmonary vasoconstriction. Furosemide, as a loop diuretic, was found in our study to accelerate the absorption of lung infiltrates.

### A systematic review of diagnostic methods to differentiate acute lung injury / acute respiratory distress syndrome from cardiogenic pulmonary edema [^714a425b]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Differentiating between cardiogenic pulmonary edema (CPE) and acute lung injury (ALI) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is challenging in the early stages of illness. The most widely accepted definition of ALI/ARDS had been based on the American-European Consensus Conference (AECC) definition, of acute onset respiratory failure with bilateral infiltrates on chest radiograph, and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) < 18 mmHg, or absence of elevated left atrial pressure. However, pulmonary artery catheterization is rarely used in clinical practice because clinical estimation of PCWP is invasive, costly, and does not aid in the diagnosis of ALI/ARDS. There were potential inconsistencies in this definition, including a lack of explicit criteria for defining acute respiratory failure, the sensitivity of the PaO2/FiO2 (P/F) ratio to ventilator settings, poor reliability of the chest radiograph criteria, and difficulties distinguishing ARDS from CPE including that these diagnoses can coexist. Based on these limitations, the Berlin definition for ARDS was published in 2012 and is reported to have better predictive validity for mortality, than this earlier definition. Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure measurement was removed from this definition. Patients were presumed to have ARDS if they had respiratory failure not fully explained by cardiac failure or fluid overload as judged by the treating physician using all available data.

In current practice and most clinical studies, ALI/ARDS is usually differentiated from CPE by the clinical circumstances and by physical findings, but this distinction is often made only by post hoc review after patient' discharge or death, and is often based on the response to therapy. The ARDS Clinical Trial Network reported that fluid management to decrease cardiogenic fluid retention and the effects of lung permeability and edema, will shorten the duration of mechanical ventilation and intensive care without increasing nonpulmonary organ failure. The differentiation between ALI/ARDS and CPE is important in order to avoid delaying treatment of fluid retention and avoiding unnecessary testing. Several biomarkers to distinguish ALI/ARDS from CPE have been reported. The aim of this systematic review was to review published studies of potential biomarkers to distinguish ALI/ARDS from CPE.

### Quick and accurate measures in negative pressure pulmonary edema: a guideline for orthognathic surgeons [^a233ddc8]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Perioperative pulmonary edema is a rare complication of maxillofacial surgery. However, this potentially fatal complication may arise during any maxillofacial surgery. Negative pressure pulmonary edema can be caused by upper airway obstruction after operation. When this phenomenon arises, if not treated properly, it progresses rapidly causing fatal outcomes. Because orthognathic surgery is performed mostly on healthy and young patients, surgeons and anesthesiologists might neglect the possibility of such complications. Therefore, we must always take into consideration the possibility of negative pressure pulmonary edema. Careful observation of the patient; accurate knowledge; and active, quick, and noninvasive safe measures are required to treat this malady when it does occur. We report a case of negative pressure pulmonary edema after orthognathic surgery and its successful treatment.

### Acute heart failure is a malignant process: but we can induce remission [^2c6338e2]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Treatment for Patients During the First Days of Admission forHas Not Been Shown to Improve Outcomes

About 20 years ago, it was suggested that the treatment of AHF can be divided into 3 major stages: first, the initial stabilization, then the first few days in the hospital, and finally before and after discharge.

The interventions administered to patients during the first hours of admission for AHF are based on little evidence. The most common treatment administered is intravenous furosemide or other types of loop diuretics. This practice is endorsed by all guidelines. For instance, the 2022 Heart Failure Clinical Practice Guidelinesinclude a level 1 recommendation for diuretics in the initial treatment of AHF, but with level B‐NR evidence (nonrandomized studies). Nonetheless, the use of intravenous loop diuretics to decrease congestion in patients with AHF during the initial first few hours of admission is important for symptom relief. The effect of this therapy on short‐ and longer‐term outcomes is, however, not known. Keeping loop diuretics as a background therapy, studies have been done throughout the years to assess the addition of other treatments early in the AHF admission. Two small studies, suggested an early benefit of intravenous nitrates on oxygenation and need for mechanical ventilation for early myocardial infarction in patients with pulmonary edema; however, a recent study has shown that those strategies do not improve short‐term outcomes. Noninvasive ventilation was also proposed as a way to improve both patients' symptoms and outcomes in the immediate stabilization of AHF; however, a prospective studyhas shown that noninvasive ventilation improves patients' dyspnea but has no effect on short‐term outcomes. Therefore, as of now, guidelines recommend the use of diuretics as the first‐line treatment of patients with AHF. Other therapies, such as intravenous vasodilators and noninvasive ventilation, can be considered for symptom improvement, but these interventions do not seem to improve short‐term outcomes.

### Beyond the evidence: treating pulmonary hypertension in the intensive care unit [^1badd028]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

The article by Muzevich and colleagues addresses important issues surrounding medication therapy in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) that present to the ICU. This review is very relevant to the critical care physician since most patients with PAH die from their underlying disease in the ICU while receiving PAH-specific therapy. Fortunately, there are now nine pharmacological agents with US Food and Drug Administration-approved labeling for use in PAH, two of which were approved in 2013. These medications have marked pharmacological differences, which poses a particular challenge in critical care patients. Muzevich and colleagues have summarized the literature and presented their experience in the management of PAH-specific therapies in ICU patients. We have selected particularly challenging areas to emphasize important points, present an alternative approach and identify areas for future research.

Of particular relevance is the lack of data on the comparative effectiveness of different vasodilator therapies either used alone or in combination. Further research in this area is certainly needed. Parenteral prostacyclin analogs (that is, epoprostenol and treprostinil) are recommended for patients with PAH who present with right heart failure or progression of their disease. However, the best treatment approach is unclear for patients with PAH and worsening right heart failure while already receiving a parenteral prostacyclin analog. In these patients, we continue all PAH-specific therapies unless there is a suspicion that the patient's presentation could be a side effect of any of these medications (particularly in cases of recent dose changes or initiation of therapy). Two noteworthy side effects are lower extremity edema in patients treated with endothelin receptor antagonists and pulmonary edema in patients with pulmonary veno-occlusive disease treated with parenteral prostacyclin analogs. Pulmonary veno-occlusive disease is a rare form of pulmonary hypertension that is particularly challenging to diagnose and is characterized by narrowing of the small pulmonary veins.

Treatment-naive PAH patients without symptoms (WHO FC I) and patients at increased risk: For treatment-naive PAH patients with WHO FC I symptoms, we suggest continued monitoring for the development of symptoms that would signal disease progression and warrant the initiation of pharmacotherapy (Ungraded consensus-based statement). Early symptoms concerning for the progression of PAH include new or worsening dyspnea on exertion, fatigue, and weakness, and as the disease evolves, symptoms including lower extremity edema, angina or syncope could signal right heart dysfunction and or failure; patients with PAH and FC I symptoms should be closely monitored for increased symptoms. We suggest that patients at increased risk for the development of PAH (Table 1) be monitored for the development of symptoms of PAH (Ungraded consensus-based statement), and we suggest also that contributing causes of PH (eg, sleep apnea and systemic hypertension) in patients with PAH be treated aggressively (Ungraded consensus-based statement).

### Drugs that may cause or exacerbate heart failure: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^bcc77b79]. Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary hypertension therapies in heart failure (HF) — bosentan and epoprostenol — carry important safety signals. In FIRST, epoprostenol was associated with an increased risk of death in patients with NYHA class IIIB/IV HF and therefore is contraindicated for long-term use in patients with HF with reduced EF. With bosentan, pooled placebo-controlled studies lasting between 4 weeks and 6 months reported leg edema in 5% of patients receiving between 100 and 2000 mg daily (n = 677) versus 1% on placebo (n = 288), and during the first 4 to 8 weeks patients with severe HF were at increased risk of hospitalization because of weight gain and increased leg edema. The REACH trial was stopped prematurely because of elevations in hepatic transaminases and showed an increased risk of death or worsening HF within the first month of therapy but not at months 4 to 6, while the ENABLE trial found similar early worsening requiring hospitalization related to fluid retention.

5.4 Fluid Retention

Peripheral edema is a known clinical consequence of PAH and worsening PAH and is also a known effect of TRACLEER and other endothelin receptor antagonists. In PAH clinical trials with TRACLEER, combined adverse events of fluid retention or edema were reported in 1.7% (placebo-corrected) of patients.

In addition, there have been numerous postmarketing reports of fluid retention in patients with pulmonary hypertension occurring within weeks after starting TRACLEER. Patients required intervention with a diuretic, fluid management, or hospitalization for decompensating heart failure.

If clinically significant fluid retention develops, with or without associated weight gain, further evaluation should be undertaken to determine the cause, such as TRACLEER or underlying heart failure, and the possible need for treatment or discontinuation of TRACLEER [see Adverse Reactions (6.1), Clinical Studies (14.2)].

5.5 Pulmonary Veno-Occlusive Disease

If signs of pulmonary edema occur, consider the possibility of associated pulmonary veno-occlusive disease and consider whether TRACLEER should be discontinued.

5.6 Decreased Sperm Counts

Decreased sperm counts have been observed in patients receiving TRACLEER. Preclinical data also suggest that TRACLEER, similar to other endothelin receptor antagonists, may have an adverse effect on spermatogenesis [see Adverse Reactions (6.1), Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)].

5.7 Decreases in Hemoglobin and Hematocrit

Treatment with TRACLEER can cause a dose-related decrease in hemoglobin and hematocrit. There have been postmarketing reports of decreases in hemoglobin concentration and hematocrit that have resulted in anemia requiring transfusion. It is recommended that hemoglobin concentrations be checked after 1 and 3 months, and every 3 months thereafter. If a marked decrease in hemoglobin concentration occurs, further evaluation should be undertaken to determine the cause and need for specific treatment [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

### Noninvasive ventilation in acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema: systematic review and meta-analysis [^197dce54]. JAMA (2005). Excellent credibility.

Context

In patients with acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema noninvasive ventilation may reduce intubation rate, but the impact on mortality and the superiority of one technique over another have not been clearly established.

Objective

To systematically review and quantitatively synthesize the short-term effect of noninvasive ventilation on major clinical outcomes.

Data Sources

MEDLINE and EMBASE (from inception to October 2005) and Cochrane databases (library issue 4, 2005) were searched to identify relevant randomized controlled trials and systematic reviews published from January 1, 1988, to October 31, 2005.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Included trials were all parallel studies comparing noninvasive ventilation to conventional oxygen therapy in patients with acute pulmonary edema. Comparisons of different techniques, either continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or bilevel noninvasive pressure support ventilation (NIPSV), were also included.

Data Synthesis

Fifteen trials were selected. Overall, noninvasive ventilation significantly reduced the mortality rate by nearly 45% compared with conventional therapy (risk ratio [RR], 0.55; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.40–0.78; P = 0.72 for heterogeneity). The results were significant for CPAP (RR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.35–0.81; P = 0.44 for heterogeneity) but not for NIPSV (RR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.34–1.05; P = 0.76 for heterogeneity), although there were fewer studies in the latter. Both modalities showed a significant decrease in the "need to intubate" rate compared with conventional therapy: CPAP (RR, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.27–0.58; P = 0.21 for heterogeneity), NIPSV (RR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.30–0.76; P = 0.24 for heterogeneity), and together (RR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.32–0.57; P = 0.20 for heterogeneity). There were no differences in intubation or mortality rates in the analysis of studies comparing the 2 techniques.

Conclusions

Noninvasive ventilation reduces the need for intubation and mortality in patients with acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema. Although the level of evidence is higher for CPAP, there are no significant differences in clinical outcomes when comparing CPAP vs NIPSV.

Conclusion

This case emphasizes that the occurrence of delayed pulmonary edema cannot be overlooked in the diagnosis and treatment process of patients inhaling nitric acid fumes, and the significance of enhancing bedside pulmonary ultrasound examination is put forward. Excellent bedside ultrasound skills can help clinicians identify and judge the degree of non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema more quickly and accurately, formulate and adjust reasonable treatment plans, so that patients can obtain better treatment effects and prognosis.

### Lung ultrasound diagnosis of pulmonary edema resulting from excessive fluid absorption during hysteroscopic myomectomy: a case report [^7d70787f]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

This case highlights a very common surgery and its rare complications, and early identification and management are crucial for successful treatment. The use of isotonic fluids during operative hysteroscopy is preferred to prevent complications such as hyponatremia and cerebral edema. However, excessive absorption of distending fluid can still lead to serious issues like pulmonary edema and cardiac overload. Pulmonary ultrasound can aid in the early detection of pulmonary edema and provide valuable insights into fluid overload. These tools are essential for timely diagnosis of fluid overload and for implementing an intervention treatment plan before clinical symptoms manifest. Eternal vigilance to the complications, quick response, and time management is the key to safely cruise through this serious complication.

Noninvasive ventilation (continuous positive airway pressure [CPAP] or noninvasive intermittent positive-pressure ventilation [NIPPV]) appears to be of benefit in the immediate treatment of patients with acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema and may reduce mortality. We conducted a study to determine whether noninvasive ventilation reduces mortality and whether there are important differences in outcome associated with the method of treatment (CPAP or NIPPV).

Methods

In a multicenter, open, prospective, randomized, controlled trial, patients were assigned to standard oxygen therapy, CPAP (5 to 15 cm of water), or NIPPV (inspiratory pressure, 8 to 20 cm of water; expiratory pressure, 4 to 10 cm of water). The primary end point for the comparison between noninvasive ventilation and standard oxygen therapy was death within 7 days after the initiation of treatment, and the primary end point for the comparison between NIPPV and CPAP was death or intubation within 7 days.

Results

A total of 1069 patients (mean [± SD] age, 77.7 ± 9.7 years; female sex, 56.9%) were assigned to standard oxygen therapy (367 patients), CPAP (346 patients), or NIPPV (356 patients). There was no significant difference in 7-day mortality between patients receiving standard oxygen therapy (9.8%) and those undergoing noninvasive ventilation (9.5%, P = 0.87). There was no significant difference in the combined end point of death or intubation within 7 days between the two groups of patients undergoing noninvasive ventilation (11.7% for CPAP and 11.1% for NIPPV, P = 0.81). As compared with standard oxygen therapy, noninvasive ventilation was associated with greater mean improvements at 1 hour after the beginning of treatment in patient-reported dyspnea (treatment difference, 0.7 on a visual-analogue scale ranging from 1 to 10; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.2 to 1.3; P = 0.008), heart rate (treatment difference, 4 beats per minute; 95% CI, 1 to 6; P = 0.004), acidosis (treatment difference, pH 0.03; 95% CI, 0.02 to 0.04; P < 0.001), and hypercapnia (treatment difference, 0.7 kPa [5.2 mm Hg]; 95% CI, 0.4 to 0.9; P < 0.001). There were no treatment-related adverse events.

Conclusions

In patients with acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema, noninvasive ventilation induces a more rapid improvement in respiratory distress and metabolic disturbance than does standard oxygen therapy but has no effect on short-term mortality. (Current Controlled Trials number, ISRCTN07448447.)

Emergency department diuretic therapy in acute heart failure — recommendations state: Level A recommendations: None specified. Level B recommendations: Treat patients with moderate-to-severe pulmonary edema resulting from acute heart failure with furosemide in combination with nitrate therapy. Level C recommendations: Aggressive diuretic monotherapy is unlikely to prevent the need for endotracheal intubation compared with aggressive nitrate monotherapy, and diuretics should be administered judiciously given the potential association between diuretics, worsening renal function, and the known association between worsening renal function at index hospitalization and long-term mortality.

### Neurogenic pulmonary edema in pediatric multiple sclerosis: patient report and summary of cases [^68fbbc23]. Pediatric Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Neurogenic pulmonary edema may be a complication of multiple neurological processes. Although there is debate regarding the underlying pathophysiology, the recognition of neurogenic pulmonary edema is vitally important because of the high-potential for mortality and need for treatment of the underlying disorder.

Methods

We present an example of recurrent neurogenic pulmonary edema in an adolescent boy with multiple sclerosis who was diagnosed with pneumonia at the time of initial presentation. We also review the presenting symptoms, physiologic parameters, and imaging findings from published reports of patients with multiple sclerosis presenting with neurogenic pulmonary edema.

Results

Although all 11 cases found via literature review presented with respiratory symptoms, cardiac dysfunction was variable, as was the presence of other neurological findings. All but one case had a documented medullary lesion. Corticosteroids were effective in resolving symptoms. Three patients were not treated with corticosteroids, and one of these died (onset of pulmonary edema during sleep).

Conclusions

Awareness of these patients may expedite recognition and treatment of future patients, thus minimizing time to appropriate treatment and reducing mortality.

### Acute respiratory distress syndrome: diagnosis and management [^36c787a4]. American Family Physician (2012). Low credibility.

Acute respiratory distress syndrome manifests as rapidly progressive dyspnea, tachypnea, and hypoxemia. Diagnostic criteria include acute onset, profound hypoxemia, bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, and the absence of left atrial hypertension. Acute respiratory distress syndrome is believed to occur when a pulmonary or extrapulmonary insult causes the release of inflammatory mediators, promoting neutrophil accumulation in the microcirculation of the lung. Neutrophils damage the vascular endothelium and alveolar epithelium, leading to pulmonary edema, hyaline membrane formation, decreased lung compliance, and difficult air exchange. Most cases of acute respiratory distress syndrome are associated with pneumonia or sepsis. It is estimated that 7.1 percent of all patients admitted to an intensive care unit and 16.1 percent of all patients on mechanical ventilation develop acute lung injury or acute respiratory distress syndrome. In-hospital mortality related to these conditions is between 34 and 55 percent, and most deaths are due to multiorgan failure. Acute respiratory distress syndrome often has to be differentiated from congestive heart failure, which usually has signs of fluid overload, and from pneumonia. Treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome is supportive and includes mechanical ventilation, prophylaxis for stress ulcers and venous thromboembolism, nutritional support, and treatment of the underlying injury. Low tidal volume, high positive end-expiratory pressure, and conservative fluid therapy may improve outcomes. A spontaneous breathing trial is indicated as the patient improves and the underlying illness resolves. Patients who survive acute respiratory distress syndrome are at risk of diminished functional capacity, mental illness, and decreased quality of life; ongoing care by a primary care physician is beneficial for these patients.

### Effect of furosemide in the treatment of high-altitude pulmonary edema [^aea067e0]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Influence of furosemide on prognosis of patients with high-altitude pulmonary edema

There were no significant differences in CT Severity Scores between the furosemide group and the non-furosemide group before and after treatment (P > 0.05) (Table 2). And we did not find any differences between the two groups in terms of the rate of invasive mechanical ventilation, length of hospital stay, and in-hospital mortality (Table 3). However, by analyzing the difference in the decrease of CT Severity Scores, the furosemide group showed a significantly higher degree of decrease compared to the non-furosemide group (P = 0.003) (Table 2).

### Acute heart failure: a novel approach to its pathogenesis and treatment [^0b645df4]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2002). Low credibility.

Acute heart failure (HF) is one of the most common syndromes in emergency medicine, however, its exact pathogenesis has remained largely unknown. Based on clinical and hemodynamic data we have sub-divided acute HF into four syndromes: cardiogenic shock, pulmonary edema, hypertensive crisis and exacerbated HF. Cardiogenic shock is caused by a severe reduction in cardiac power which is not met by an adequate increase in peripheral vascular resistance leading to significant decrease in blood pressure and end organ perfusion. Hence the treatment of cardiogenic shock should be directed at improving cardiac performance (by optimizing filling pressure, intra-aortic balloon pump and immediate revascularization) and administration of peripheral vasoconstrictors. The other acute HF syndromes (pulmonary edema, HTN crisis and exacerbated HF) are caused by a combination of progressive excessive vasoconstriction superimposed on reduced left ventricular functional reserve. The impaired cardiac power and extreme vasoconstriction induce a vicious cycle of afterload mismatch resulting in a dramatic reduction of CO and elevated left ventricular end diastolic pressure, which is transferred backwards to the pulmonary capillaries yielding pulmonary edema. Therefore, the immediate treatment of these acute HF syndromes should be based on the administration of strong, fast-acting intravenous vasodilators such as nitrates or nitroprusside. After initial stabilization, therapy should be directed at reducing recurrent episodes of acute HF, by prevention of repeated episodes of excessive vasoconstriction along with efforts to optimize cardiac function.

### The clinical usefulness of extravascular lung water and pulmonary vascular permeability index to diagnose and characterize pulmonary edema: a prospective multicenter study on the quantitative differential diagnostic definition for acute lung injury / acute respiratory distress syndrome [^923bd0fd]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

Assessment of circulatory/respiratory status, other parameters, and clinical course

At the time of enrollment (day 0), the clinical conditions, cause of respiratory insufficiency, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score, and Lung Injury Scale score were assessed. Echocardiography was performed to measure the left ventricular ejection fraction, left ventricular end-diastolic dimension, interventricular septum thickness, E/A ratio, left atrial dimension, inferior vena cava diameter and its respiratory variation, presence of hypo/akinesis, valvular abnormality, left ventricular systolic/diastolic function, and the thermodilution hemodynamic assessment validity. Chest computed tomography was also conducted on the day of enrollment. B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) or N -terminal pro-BNP was measured on the day of enrollment and daily thereafter.

From the day of enrollment to day 2, the circulatory/respiratory status and other parameters except for routine clinical workup were assessed; the clinical course, including respirator settings, Lung Injury Scale score, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score, antithrombin activity level, serum procalcitonin level, daily fluid intake/output and balance, and therapeutic interventions (surgery, antibiotics, steroids, diuretics, renal replacement therapy, and so forth) were recorded daily.

All patients were followed for 28 days after enrollment and assessed for 28-day all-cause mortality.

### Macitentan (Opsumit) [^6403259e]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.3 Fluid Retention

Peripheral edema and fluid retention are known clinical consequences of PAH and known effects of ERAs. In the placebo-controlled study of OPSUMIT in PAH, the incidence of edema was 21.9% in the OPSUMIT 10 mg group and 20.5% in the placebo group.

Patients with underlying left ventricular dysfunction may be at particular risk for developing significant fluid retention after initiation of ERA treatment. In a small study of OPSUMIT in patients with pulmonary hypertension because of left ventricular dysfunction, more patients in the OPSUMIT group developed significant fluid retention and had more hospitalizations because of worsening heart failure compared to those randomized to placebo. Postmarketing cases of edema and fluid retention occurring within weeks of starting OPSUMIT, some requiring intervention with a diuretic or hospitalization for decompensated heart failure, have been reported [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

Monitor for signs of fluid retention after OPSUMIT initiation. If clinically significant fluid retention develops, evaluate the patient to determine the cause, such as OPSUMIT or underlying heart failure, and the possible need to discontinue OPSUMIT.

5.4 Hemoglobin Decrease

Decreases in hemoglobin concentration and hematocrit have occurred following administration of other ERAs and were observed in clinical studies with OPSUMIT. These decreases occurred early and stabilized thereafter. In the placebo-controlled study of OPSUMIT in PAH, OPSUMIT 10 mg caused a mean decrease in hemoglobin from baseline to up to 18 months of about 1.0 g/dL compared to no change in the placebo group. A decrease in hemoglobin to below 10.0 g/dL was reported in 8.7% of the OPSUMIT 10 mg group and in 3.4% of the placebo group. Decreases in hemoglobin seldom require transfusion. Initiation of OPSUMIT is not recommended in patients with severe anemia. Measure hemoglobin prior to initiation of treatment and repeat during treatment as clinically indicated [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

5.5 Pulmonary Edema with Pulmonary Veno-occlusive Disease (PVOD)

Should signs of pulmonary edema occur, consider the possibility of associated PVOD. If confirmed, discontinue OPSUMIT.

5.6 Decreased Sperm Counts

OPSUMIT, like other ERAs, may have an adverse effect on spermatogenesis. Counsel men about potential effects on fertility [see Use in Specific Populations (8.3) and Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)].

### Contralateral reexpansion pulmonary edema with ipsilateral collapsed lung after pleural effusion drainage: a case report [^026f4cdb]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

Reexpansion pulmonary edema is usually associated with reexpansion of a chronically collapsed lung due to a large amount of air, pleural fluid, or huge masses. The reexpansion pulmonary edema mostly happens within a few hours after reexpansion of the collapsed lung. However, the onset of reexpansion pulmonary edema can occur anytime within 24 h of reexpansion. Reexpansion pulmonary edema is a rare but potentially life- threatening condition (mortality of up to 20%). The clinical manifestations of reexpansion pulmonary edema can range from radiographic findings without any clinical symptoms to fetal hypoxia or even hemodynamic instability. Because most cases are detected incidentally on radiography, the true incidence is still unclear (0.9–20%). The chest CT findings of reexpansion pulmonary edema are peripheral patchy lesions of ground glass opacity with a vascular distribution, which were usually associated with consolidation as well as interstitial thickening.

Although exact etiologies and mechanisms are still not fully understood, some pathogenic factors for reexpansion pulmonary edema have been suggested: (1) rapid reexpansion, (2) drainage with the use of negative intrapleural pressure, (3) decreased surfactant activity, (4) increased pulmonary vascular permeability due to injuries to the pulmonary micro- vessels, (5) airway obstruction, (6) pulmonary artery pressure change, and (7) chronicity of lung collapse. Rapid reexpansion, drainage with the use of negative intrapleural pressure, and chronicity of lung collapse are considered the major risk factors for reexpansion pulmonary edema.

The mainstay of treatment remains generally conservative and supportive, including sufficient oxygen supplement. Some more intensive treatments, such as mechanical ventilation, steroid and diuretics administration, and circulation resuscitation, are required in severe cases of reexpansion pulmonary edema, such as treatment of adult respiratory distress syndrome. Concomitant contralateral reexpansion pulmonary edema is associated with more severe symptoms and higher mortality.
