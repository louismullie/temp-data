## Question

what symptoms for hyperkalemia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the symptoms of hyperkalemia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how hyperkalemia is defined and how severity is categorized. Then, I should verify which organ systems are affected and what symptoms typically occur. Next, I will examine how often patients are asymptomatic and whether symptoms correlate with potassium level or ECG changes. After that, I should consider special populations and contexts that modify presentation. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, symptom-based framework and note red flags that warrant urgent treatment, making sure I anchor each point to guidelines and high-quality reviews.

> Let me first confirm the definition and severity thresholds, because symptom risk tracks with severity and clinical context. Hyperkalemia is generally defined as serum potassium greater than 5.0 mmol/L, with mild 5.0–5.9, moderate 6.0–6.4, and severe 6.5 or higher, although some guidelines use slightly different cut points and integrate ECG findings into severity classification, so I should keep both concentration and ECG in mind when interpreting symptoms [^1172XMC2] [^115Lhcuz].

> Wait, let me verify which organ systems are most affected. The cardinal manifestations cluster in three domains: cardiac, neuromuscular, and gastrointestinal, reflecting potassium's role in membrane excitability and conduction. Importantly, many patients, especially with mild to moderate elevations, are asymptomatic, so absence of symptoms does not exclude danger, particularly when potassium is rising rapidly or ECG changes are present [^111ysrgx] [^112KvyxG] [^115YW31T].

> I will now examine cardiac symptoms, since these are the most life-threatening. Patients may report palpitations, chest discomfort, or syncope, but severe hyperkalemia can precipitate bradyarrhythmias, ventricular fibrillation, or asystole without prodrome; ECG changes include peaked T waves, PR prolongation, P-wave flattening, QRS widening, and sine-wave morphology, though I should double-check that ECG is an insensitive screening tool and a normal tracing does not exclude lethal risk [^113hTA5U] [^115YW31T] [^115YW31T].

> Next, I should review neuromuscular symptoms. Ascending muscle weakness and flaccid paralysis are classic, often starting distally and progressing proximally; paresthesias and fatigue are common, and in severe cases respiratory muscle involvement can occur. Hold on, I should verify that these findings are more typical with potassium levels around 6.5 mmol/L or higher or with rapid rises, and that they can be accompanied by areflexia in advanced cases [^113hTA5U] [^1172XMC2] [^116qJoqH].

> Let me consider gastrointestinal symptoms. Nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain can occur, and severe hyperkalemia may cause paralytic ileus; I need to ensure I don't misattribute ileus to other causes when hyperkalemia is present, as this can delay life-saving therapy [^113hTA5U] [^116qJoqH].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about symptom prevalence. I should confirm how often patients are asymptomatic. Most individuals with mild hyperkalemia are asymptomatic, and even moderate elevations may be silent; symptoms tend to emerge with higher levels, rapid rises, or in the presence of ECG changes, but I must remember that life-threatening arrhythmias can occur without warning, so clinical context and ECG assessment remain critical even when the patient feels well [^113hTA5U] [^1172XMC2] [^115YW31T].

> I need to check special contexts that modify presentation. In chronic kidney disease, patients may tolerate higher potassium levels due to adaptive mechanisms yet still be at risk for sudden decompensation; in heart failure, hyperkalemia often reflects disease severity and medication interactions rather than primary symptoms; in pediatrics, symptoms mirror adults but presentations may be subtler; in older adults, polypharmacy and comorbidities blunt symptom expression, so I should maintain a low threshold for ECG and urgent therapy when potassium is 6.0 mmol/L or higher or when ECG is abnormal [^114C8jgq] [^1162h5y3] [^112ML5NU] [^115Lhcuz].

> Let me synthesize a practical framework. Mild hyperkalemia is usually asymptomatic and detected on routine labs; moderate hyperkalemia may bring nonspecific fatigue or mild weakness; severe hyperkalemia can produce marked ascending weakness, paresthesias, ileus, and dangerous cardiac arrhythmias. But wait, I should emphasize again that ECG changes and clinical trajectory matter as much as the number, so any ECG abnormality or rapid rise warrants emergent treatment even if the patient reports minimal symptoms [^113hTA5U] [^1172XMC2] [^115h7Ejq].

> Finally, I should confirm red flags that mandate urgent therapy. Muscle weakness or paralysis, palpitations or syncope, new ECG changes such as peaked T waves, PR prolongation, QRS widening, or sine-wave pattern, and potassium 6.5 mmol/L or higher are indications for immediate stabilization and potassium-lowering measures. I need to ensure I do not rely on symptoms alone to decide urgency, given the poor correlation between symptoms and arrhythmic risk [^113hTA5U] [^1172XMC2] [^112KvyxG].

Hyperkalemia symptoms are **primarily neuromuscular and cardiac**, with severity correlating to potassium level and rate of rise [^113hTA5U]. Mild cases are often **asymptomatic**, but as potassium rises, patients may develop **ascending muscle weakness or flaccid paralysis**, paresthesias, and cramping [^113hTA5U]. Cardiac effects include palpitations, bradycardia, conduction blocks, and life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias or asystole [^113hTA5U]; ECG changes may precede symptoms and are not reliably correlated with potassium level [^115YW31T]. Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and ileus can occur, and respiratory muscle involvement may lead to respiratory failure [^116qJoqH]. Prompt recognition and ECG monitoring are essential because symptoms can escalate rapidly and be fatal [^1124Vteu].

---

## Neuromuscular symptoms

Neuromuscular manifestations are among the **most common and clinically significant** symptoms of hyperkalemia [^113hTA5U]. They typically present as:

- **Muscle weakness**: Often ascending, starting in the lower limbs and progressing proximally, potentially leading to flaccid paralysis [^113hTA5U].

- **Paresthesias**: Tingling or numbness, particularly in the extremities [^notfound].

- **Cramping**: Muscle cramps and spasms are common [^notfound].

- **Respiratory muscle involvement**: Severe hyperkalemia can cause respiratory muscle weakness, leading to respiratory failure [^notfound].

---

## Cardiac symptoms

Cardiac manifestations are the **most life-threatening** aspect of hyperkalemia, often occurring without significant neuromuscular symptoms [^113hTA5U]. These include:

- **Palpitations**: Sensation of irregular or forceful heartbeats [^113hTA5U].

- **Bradycardia**: Sinus bradycardia or sinus arrest [^notfound].

- **Conduction abnormalities**: Prolonged PR interval, bundle branch blocks, and second-degree or complete heart block [^113hTA5U].

- **Ventricular arrhythmias**: Ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia [^notfound].

- **Asystole**: Cardiac arrest due to severe hyperkalemia [^111cd3TY].

Electrocardiographic (ECG) changes often precede clinical symptoms and include peaked T waves, PR interval prolongation, QRS widening, and sine wave morphology [^113hTA5U]. However, the correlation between serum potassium levels and ECG changes is inconsistent, and **a normal ECG does not exclude severe hyperkalemia** [^115YW31T].

---

## Gastrointestinal symptoms

Gastrointestinal symptoms are less specific but may occur, particularly in **moderate to severe hyperkalemia**:

- **Nausea and vomiting**: Common gastrointestinal complaints [^116qJoqH].

- **Abdominal pain**: May be present [^notfound].

- **Paralytic ileus**: Severe hyperkalemia can cause ileus, leading to bowel obstruction [^116qJoqH].

---

## Clinical correlation with potassium levels

The severity of symptoms correlates with both the **absolute serum potassium level** and the **rate of increase** [^113hTA5U]:

| **Severity** | **Serum potassium level** | **Typical symptoms** |
|-|-|-|
| Mild | 5.0–5.5 mmol/L | Usually asymptomatic or mild fatigue |
| Moderate | 5.5–6.5 mmol/L | Muscle weakness, paresthesias, palpitations |
| Severe | ≥ 6.5 mmol/L | Flaccid paralysis, respiratory failure, life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias |

---

## Special considerations

Certain patient populations may exhibit **atypical or more severe symptoms**:

- **Chronic kidney disease (CKD)**: Patients with CKD may have chronic hyperkalemia and may be relatively asymptomatic until severe elevations occur [^113hTA5U].

- **Diabetes mellitus**: Hyperkalemia in diabetic patients may be exacerbated by insulin deficiency and metabolic acidosis, increasing the risk of severe neuromuscular and cardiac symptoms [^113hTA5U].

- **Medications**: Drugs such as ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and potassium-sparing diuretics can precipitate hyperkalemia, often masking symptoms until severe elevations are reached [^1157By8d].

---

## Conclusion

Hyperkalemia presents with a range of symptoms, primarily affecting neuromuscular and cardiac systems. Mild cases may be asymptomatic, but as potassium levels rise, patients may develop muscle weakness, paresthesias, cardiac arrhythmias, and gastrointestinal symptoms. Rapid recognition and prompt treatment are critical, as **severe hyperkalemia can lead to fatal cardiac arrhythmias and respiratory failure** [^113hTA5U].

### How dangerous is hyperkalemia? [^1179Cqu6]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Hyperkalemia is a potentially life-threatening electrolyte disorder appreciated with greater frequency in patients with renal disease, heart failure, and with use of certain medications such as renin angiotensin aldosterone inhibitors. The traditional views that hyperkalemia can be reliably diagnosed by electrocardiogram and that particular levels of hyperkalemia confer cardiotoxic risk have been challenged by several reports of patients with atypic presentations. Epidemiologic data demonstrate strong associations of morbidity and mortality in patients with hyperkalemia but these associations appear disconnected in certain patient populations and in differing clinical presentations. Physiologic adaptation, structural cardiac disease, medication use, and degree of concurrent illness might predispose certain patients presenting with hyperkalemia to a lower or higher threshold for toxicity. These factors are often overlooked; yet data suggest that the clinical context in which hyperkalemia develops is at least as important as the degree of hyperkalemia is in determining patient outcome. This review summarizes the clinical data linking hyperkalemia with poor outcomes and discusses how the efficacy of certain treatments might depend on the clinical presentation.

Background and Objectives

Hyperkalemia is one of the few potentially lethal electrolyte disturbances. Prompt recognition and expeditious treatment of severe hyperkalemia are expected to save lives. This review is intended to provide intensivists and other interested clinicians with an understanding of the pathophysiology that underlies hyperkalemia, and a rational approach to its management.

Methods

This article reviews and analyzes literature relevant to the pathophysiology and management of severe hyperkalemia. Methods include search of MEDLINE, and bibliographic search of current textbooks and journal articles.

Results and Conclusions

A more complete understanding of potassium homeostasis in recent years has led to new approaches to the management of severe hyperkalemia. The physiologically based sequential approach still applies. The efficacy, pitfalls, and risks of the agents available for use at each step in the sequence are critically reviewed. Rational use of the available tools will allow clinicians to successfully treat severe hyperkalemia.

### Dispelling myths and misconceptions about the treatment of acute hyperkalemia [^111gKdBN]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Hyperkalemia represents a widespread and potentially lethal condition that affects millions of people across their lives. Despite the prevalence and severity of the condition, there are no consensus guidelines on the treatment of hyperkalemia or even a standard definition. Herein, we provide a succinct review of what we believe to be the most significant misconceptions encountered in the emergency care of hyperkalemia, examine current available literature, and discuss practical points on several modalities of hyperkalemia treatment. Additionally, we review the pathophysiology of the electrocardiographic effects of hyperkalemia and how intravenous calcium preparations can antagonize these effects. We conclude each section with recommendations to aid emergency physicians in making safe and efficacious choices for the treatment of acute hyperkalemia.

### Disorders of potassium [^114WHxyU]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

Potassium disorders are the most common electrolyte abnormality identified in clinical practice. Presenting symptoms are similar for both hypo- and hyperkalemia, primarily affecting the cardiac, neuromuscular, and gastrointestinal systems. Generally, mild hypokalemia is the most common potassium disorder seen clinically; however, severe complications can occur. Hyperkalemia is less common but more serious, especially if levels are rising rapidly. The etiologies and treatments for both hypo- and hyperkalemia are discussed, with special emphasis on the role medications play in the etiologies of each.

### Tailoring treatment of hyperkalemia [^112Sp5EZ]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2019). Medium credibility.

Hyperkalemia is a common electrolyte disorder that may be rapidly life-threatening because of its cardiac toxicity. Hyperkalemia risk factors are numerous and often combined in the same patient. Most of the strategies to control serum potassium level in the short term have been used for decades. However, evidence for their efficacy and safety remains low. Treatment of hyperkalemia remains challenging, poorly codified, with a risk of overtreatment, including short-term side effects, and with the priority of avoiding unnecessary hospital stays or chronic medication changes. Recently, new oral treatments have been proposed for non-life-threatening hyperkalemia, with encouraging results. Their role in the therapeutic arsenal remains uncertain. Finally, a growing body of evidence suggests that hyperkalemia might negatively impact outcomes in the long term in patients with chronic heart failure or kidney failure through underdosing or withholding of cardiovascular medication (e.g. renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors). Recognition of efficacy and potential side effects of treatment may help in tailoring treatments to the patient's status and conditions. In this review we discuss how treatment of hyperkalemia could be tailored to the patient's conditions and status, both on the short and mid term.

### A physiologic-based approach to the treatment of acute hyperkalemia [^1158EG2z]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Hyperkalemia is a common and potentially lethal disorder. Given its variable presentation, clinicians should have a high index of suspicion, especially in patients with chronic kidney disease. The present case highlights key physiologic mechanisms in the development of hyperkalemia and provides an outline for emergent treatment. In this context, we discuss specific mechanisms of action of available treatments of hyperkalemia.

### Hyperkalemia… [^111ysrgx]. AAFP (2006). Low credibility.

HYPERKALEMIA CAUSED BY DECREASED EXCRETION OF POTASSIUM Effective excretion of potassium is dependent on aldosterone and sufficient distal delivery of sodium and water within the nephron. Hyperkalemia may occur when one of these mechanisms is impaired because of renal failure, renal hypoperfusion, or hypoaldosteronism. Hypoaldosteronism may be the cause of hyperkalemia in patients who do not have advanced renal failure or hypoperfusion. ADRENAL INSUFFICIENCY The possibility of adrenal insufficiency should be considered in all patients with hyperkalemia. Clinical suspicion is increased by the presence of hyponatremia and muscular weakness. 17 Primary adrenal insufficiency is best screened for with a standard cosyntropin-stimulation test, 18 in which 0. 25 mg of synthetic cosyntropin is given as an intravenous bolus.

Plasma cortisol is measured 45 to 60 minutes later, and values less than 20 mcg per dL suggest adrenal insufficiency.
19. Diagnosis The initial diagnostic approach begins with the clinical history, review of medications, and physical examination. Symptoms and signs include muscular weakness or flaccid paralysis, ileus, and characteristic electrocardiograph changes. The transtubular potassium gradient is an assessment of renal potassium handling, with a normal value of eight to nine, rising at times to 11 after an increase in potassium intake. Values lower than five in the face of hyperkalemia suggest an inappropriate renal response to high potassium 22, 23) 22; a very low value suggests hypoaldosteronism.
23. Urgent treatment should not be delayed while a work-up for the etiology is undertaken, although urine potassium, creatinine, and osmolarity studies should be obtained before serum potassium levels are significantly altered.

Although controlled trials have not been conducted, it is thought that potassium levels greater than 6. 0 mEq per L are clinically significant. ECG changes in a patient with hyperkalemia are an ominous portent of potentially fatal arrhythmias. However, hyperkalemia can be life threatening even if the ECG is normal, 25, 26 and about one half of patients with potassium levels exceeding 6. 0 mEq per L have a normal ECG. 1.

This review aims to summarize the recent findings and the current concepts related to the epidemiology, pathological mechanisms, and implications of hyperkalemia, and to discuss novel therapeutic approaches in patients with HF. Although strategies of management are not evidence based, a deep investigation and understanding of these issues could form the basis for a better treatment of dyskalemia in those patients, and hence their optimum clinical approach.

### Hyperkalemia in heart failure: foe or friend? [^1156aaAN]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

The extent to which hyperkalemia is implicated in the morbidity of HF patients is difficult to assess, since it may be asymptomatic and may only be discovered through routine blood screening, or as a consequence of the condition leading to hospitalization (eg, infection, dehydration, or deteriorating kidney function), rather than causing the hospitalization itself. Patients at high risk for hyperkalemia are often those with disease states such as HF and CKD, who also stand to benefit most from RAASi. However, most clinical trials have excluded patients with advanced CKD, who are those at the highest risk for hyperkalemia; consequently, we lack evidence regarding the therapeutic management and long‐term outcomes in this population.

Hyperkalemia severity — suggested action for moderate and severe elevations is stratified by thresholds and clinical context. Moderate hyperkalemia (K+ 6.0–6.4 mmol/l) warrants, if clinically unwell or acute kidney injury (AKI), to assess and treat in hospital, and if an unexpected result, to repeat within 24 hours. Severe hyperkalemia (K+ ≥ 6.5 mmol/l) warrants to take immediate action to assess and treat, with assessment to include blood testing and electrocardiogram monitoring.

### Potassium disorders: hypokalemia and hyperkalemia [^113hTA5U]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on hyperkalemia:

- **Definition**: Hyperkalemia is defined as an increase in serum potassium levels > 5.0 mmol/L.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of hyperkalemia involves disruptions in potassium balance due to excess potassium intake, impaired potassium excretion, or transcellular shifts. The etiology is often multifactorial, with impaired renal function, medication use, and hyperglycemia being the most common contributors.
- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of hyperkalemia in the US is estimated at 1,550 per 100,000 population.
- **Disease course**: Mild and moderate hyperkalemia are usually asymptomatic. Severe cases may manifest as muscle weakness, ascending paralysis, heart palpitations, and paresthesias. ECG changes associated with hyperkalemia include peaked T waves, P-wave flattening, PR-interval prolongation, widening of the QRS complex, and sine waves.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of hyperkalemia is dependent on the severity of the condition and the promptness of treatment. Severe untreated hyperkalemia can lead to life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias and cardiac arrest.

### Management of hyperkalemia: an update for the internist [^112sDH5S]. The American Journal of Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Hyperkalemia is a clinically important electrolyte abnormality that occurs most commonly in patients with chronic kidney disease. Due to its propensity to induce electrophysiological disturbances, severe hyperkalemia is considered a medical emergency. The management of acute and chronic hyperkalemia can be achieved through the implementation of various interventions, one of which is the elimination of medications that can raise serum potassium levels. Because many such medications (especially inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system) have shown beneficial effects in patients with cardiovascular and renal disease, their discontinuation for reasons of hyperkalemia represent an undesirable clinical compromise. The emergence of 2 new potassium-binding medications for acute and chronic therapy of hyperkalemia may soon allow the continued use of medications such as renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors even in patients who are prone to hyperkalemia. This review article provides an overview of the physiology and the pathophysiology of potassium metabolism and hyperkalemia, the epidemiology of hyperkalemia, and its acute and chronic management. We discuss in detail emerging data about new potassium-lowering therapies, and their potential future role in clinical practice.

### Severe hyperkalemia requiring hospitalization: predictors of mortality [^116UZrsb]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

Key messages

- Severe hyperkalemia occurs with diverse precipitating factors in patients with various medical conditions.

- An increased in-hospital mortality rate is significantly associated with severe underlying disease and coexisting medical conditions as well as with severe hyperkalemia itself.

- More importantly, the mortality rate is higher in patients with normal baseline renal function than in those with underlying CKD.

### Hyperkalemia treatment standard [^11415M5d]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

Hyperkalemia is a common electrolyte disturbance in both inpatient and outpatient clinical practice. The severity and associated risk depends on the underlying cause and rate of potassium (K+) increase. Acute hyperkalemia requires immediate attention due to potentially life-threatening manifestations resulting from the rapid increase in plasma K+ concentration. Treatment is initially focused on stabilizing the cardiac membrane, followed by maneuvers to shift K+ into the cells, and ultimately initiating strategies to decrease total body K+ content. Chronic hyperkalemia develops over a more extended period of time and manifestations tend to be less severe. Nevertheless, the disorder is not benign since chronic hyperkalemia is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. The approach to patients with chronic hyperkalemia begins with a review of medications potentially responsible for the disorder, ensuring effective diuretic therapy and correcting metabolic acidosis if present. The practice of restricting foods high in K+ to manage hyperkalemia is being reassessed since the evidence supporting the effectiveness of this strategy is lacking. Rather, dietary restriction should be more nuanced, focusing on reducing the intake of nonplant sources of K+. Down-titration and/or discontinuation of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone inhibitors should be discouraged since these drugs improve outcomes in patients with heart failure and proteinuric kidney disease. In addition to other conservative measures, K+ binding drugs and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors can assist in maintaining the use of these drugs.

### Hyperkalemia: pathophysiology, risk factors and consequences [^1157By8d]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2019). Medium credibility.

There have been significant recent advances in our understanding of the mechanisms that maintain potassium homoeostasis and the clinical consequences of hyperkalemia. In this article we discuss these advances within a concise review of the pathophysiology, risk factors and consequences of hyperkalemia. We highlight aspects that are of particular relevance for clinical practice. Hyperkalemia occurs when renal potassium excretion is limited by reductions in glomerular filtration rate, tubular flow, distal sodium delivery or the expression of aldosterone-sensitive ion transporters in the distal nephron. Accordingly, the major risk factors for hyperkalemia are renal failure, diabetes mellitus, adrenal disease and the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers or potassium-sparing diuretics. Hyperkalemia is associated with an increased risk of death, and this is only in part explicable by hyperkalemia-induced cardiac arrhythmia. In addition to its well-established effects on cardiac excitability, hyperkalemia could also contribute to peripheral neuropathy and cause renal tubular acidosis. Hyperkalemia-or the fear of hyperkalemia-contributes to the underprescription of potentially beneficial medications, particularly in heart failure. The newer potassium binders could play a role in attempts to minimize reduced prescribing of renin-angiotensin inhibitors and mineraolocorticoid antagonists in this context.

Abstract

There have been significant recent advances in our understanding of the mechanisms that maintain potassium homoeostasis and the clinical consequences of hyperkalemia.

### Disorders of potassium [^114RnHW7]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

Abnormalities in serum potassium are commonly encountered in patients presenting to the emergency department. A variety of acute and chronic causes can lead to life-threatening illness in both hyperkalemia and hypokalemia. Here we summarize the relevant causes, risks, and treatment options for these frequently encountered disorders.

### Hyperkalemia in the setting of severe leukocytosis: should you treat? [^117QSbyY]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Severe hyperkalemia is a common and life-threatening problem presenting to the emergency department. Rapid correction of the electrolyte abnormality is essential but doing so can be detrimental in circumstances under which delaying treatment for confirmation is required. Our case exemplifies one of those scenarios: pseudohyperkalemia in the setting of severe leukocytosis.

Case

An elderly woman with long-standing but untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia presented with a left hip fracture. She was found to have a potassium level of 8.4 mEq/L without symptoms of hyperkalemia, renal disease, or EKG findings. Her white blood cell count was 444 K/uL. Despite a potentially life-threatening hyperkalemia, correction was deferred pending confirmation by venous whole blood, which revealed a normal potassium level.

Discussion

Pseudohyperkalemia can occur in the setting of severe leukocytosis. It is important for emergency physicians to recognize this phenomenon and avoid iatrogenic hypokalemia. The pathophysiology behind this phenomenon and the methods for correct analysis are presented here.

### Potassium disorders: hypokalemia and hyperkalemia [^115h7Ejq]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Hypokalemia and hyperkalemia occur when serum potassium levels are less than 3.5 mEq per L or greater than 5.0 mEq per L, respectively. The World Health Organization recommends a potassium intake of at least 3,510 mg per day for optimal cardiovascular health. Hypokalemia is caused by decreased intake, renal losses, gastrointestinal losses, or transcellular shifts. Severe features of hypokalemia that require urgent treatment include a serum potassium level of 2.5 mEq per L or less, electrocardiography abnormalities, or neuromuscular symptoms. The underlying cause should be addressed, and potassium levels replenished. An oral route is preferred if the patient has a functioning gastrointestinal tract and a serum potassium level greater than 2.5 mEq per L. Hyperkalemia is caused by impaired renal excretion, transcellular shifts, or increased potassium intake. Electrocardiography identifies cardiac conduction disturbances but may not correlate with serum potassium levels. Emergent treatment is recommended for patients with clinical signs and symptoms (e.g., muscle weakness, paralysis) or if electrocardiography abnormalities are present. Acute treatment may include intravenous calcium, insulin, sodium bicarbonate, diuretics, and beta agonists. Dialysis may be considered in the presence of end-stage renal disease, severe renal impairment, or ongoing potassium release. Patiromer and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate are newer potassium binders and may be used in chronic or acute hyperkalemia. Sodium polystyrene sulfonate is associated with serious gastrointestinal adverse effects. Long-term management of potassium disturbances includes correcting underlying conditions, dietary counseling, and adjusting causative medications.

2 SCIENTIFIC BACKGROUND

2.1 Definition of hyperkalemia

Hyperkalemia can be classified as acute (as occurring in an emergent setting), chronic, or recurrent, depending on the onset and number of hyperkalemia episodes that have occurred. The decision of whether emergency therapy is warranted is largely based on subjective clinical judgement. The lack of robust and evidence‐based treatment guidelines for the management of hyperkalemia in the emergency department poses a challenge for treatment.

Although the European Society of Cardiology (ESC), Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO), and other organizations, such as the American College of Cardiology (ACC), American Heart Association (AHA), and Hearth Failure Society of America (HFSA)have issued guidelines, the concentration of potassium that is labelled as hyperkalemia varies. Serum potassium concentrations of 5.0,5.5, or 6.0 mmol/Lare commonly used cutoffs for the definition of hyperkalemia.

The KDIGO controversies' conference report defines the severity of hyperkalemia by both serum potassium concentration and ECG changes. The most common ECG change is peaked T waves, followed by QRS prolongation. Hyperkalemia is classified as mild, moderate, or severe based on potassium concentration and the presence or absence of ECG changes. Serum potassium concentrations ≥ 5.0–5.9 mmol/L are typically defined as mild and ≥ 6.0–6.4 mmol/L as moderate. Serum potassium concentrations ≥ 6.5 mmol/L are typically defined as severe.

### Hyperkalemia in heart failure: foe or friend? [^1162h5y3]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Heart failure (HF) is a syndrome with high morbidity and mortality that has acquired pandemic dimensions, affecting more than 38 million people worldwide. 1 In addition, the progressive nature of HF makes it a leading cause of hospitalization, due to the deleterious effects of sustained neurohormonal activation and comorbidities. 2 Electrolytic disturbances, most usually of potassium levels, very often accompany HF, are a hindrance to the optimization of medication and impose a further burden on the patient. Since potassium plays a major role in cardiac excitability and arrhythmias, dyskalemia is an important clinical problem that is associated with significant life‐threatening complications. 3, 4 Although the definition is not consistent always, hyperkalemia is generally defined as a serum potassium level > 5.0 to 5.5 mEq/L and can be further classified as mild (5.6‐6.0 mEq/L), moderate (6.1‐7.0 mEq/L), and severe (> 7.0 mEq/L). Potassium secretion is highly dependent on renin‐angiotensin‐aldosterone system (RAAS) activity and renal perfusion, as well as sodium availability to the distal nephron. Hyperkalemia represents both a direct risk for cardiovascular morbidity and a potential biomarker of adverse prognosis and disease severity. Patients with HF are at particularly high risk for hyperkalemia, which is likely to reflect some medical comorbidity, especially renal dysfunction. In addition, it is one of the most common factors that impede the optimum pharmaceutical approach to HF, leading to underuse of renin‐angiotensin‐aldosterone system inhibitors (RAASi) and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs), which are the drugs that offer the most help and have changed the outcomes of HF patients. 5 Unfortunately, some additional independent risk factors, such as diabetes mellitus (DM), advanced age and renal insufficiency, that exacerbate all‐cause and in‐hospital mortality and hospitalizations in HF patients, also further increase the risk of hyperkalemia. At the opposite end of the scale is hypokalemia, which can also be observed in HF patients and can increase the risk of mortality, mainly via arrhythmogenic complications. 6, 7, 8 Thus, both high and low potassium levels are unacceptable in HF patients. Data from the literature highlight the need for careful potassium monitoring, especially in the presence of comorbidities, with special emphasis being placed on patients with a low estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). 5

### An international Delphi consensus regarding best practice recommendations for hyperkalaemia across the cardiorenal spectrum [^1172XMC2]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hyperkalaemia is a potentially life‐threatening medical condition of elevated blood potassium levels; 3.5–5.0 mEq/L is considered the normokalaemic range in adults, while instances of hyperkalaemia > 5.5 mEq/L are more clearly associated with adverse clinical outcomes. There is no universally accepted definition for hyperkalaemia severity. The European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines recommend using a lower cut‐off for mild (> 5.0 mEq/L), moderate (> 5.5 mEq/L), or severe (> 6.0 mEq/L) hyperkalaemia, for closer monitoring of patients who may be at risk of hyperkalaemic complications. Other guidelines, such as those endorsed by the UK Renal Association (UKRA), utilise a more stringent outcome‐associated definition (mild: > 5.5 mEq/L, moderate: > 6.0 mEq/L, and severe: > 6.5 mEq/L). Most individuals with hyperkalaemia (particularly those with mild hyperkalaemia) are asymptomatic but when symptoms do occur, they tend to be non‐specific. Untreated, severe hyperkalaemia can result in life‐threatening cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, paralysis, and mortality.

### Potassium disorders: hypokalemia and hyperkalemia [^115KhjSU]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Hypokalemia and hyperkalemia are common electrolyte disorders caused by changes in potassium intake, altered excretion, or transcellular shifts. Diuretic use and gastrointestinal losses are common causes of hypokalemia, whereas kidney disease, hyperglycemia, and medication use are common causes of hyperkalemia. When severe, potassium disorders can lead to life-threatening cardiac conduction disturbances and neuromuscular dysfunction. Therefore, a first priority is determining the need for urgent treatment through a combination of history, physical examination, laboratory, and electrocardiography findings. Indications for urgent treatment include severe or symptomatic hypokalemia or hyperkalemia; abrupt changes in potassium levels; electrocardiography changes; or the presence of certain comorbid conditions. Hypokalemia is treated with oral or intravenous potassium. To prevent cardiac conduction disturbances, intravenous calcium is administered to patients with hyperkalemic electrocardiography changes. Insulin, usually with concomitant glucose, and albuterol are preferred to lower serum potassium levels in the acute setting; sodium polystyrene sulfonate is reserved for subacute treatment. For both disorders, it is important to consider potential causes of transcellular shifts because patients are at increased risk of rebound potassium disturbances.

### Hyperkalemia [^116MgUnZ]. American Family Physician (2006). Low credibility.

Hyperkalemia is a potentially life-threatening metabolic problem caused by inability of the kidneys to excrete potassium, impairment of the mechanisms that move potassium from the circulation into the cells, or a combination of these factors. Acute episodes of hyperkalemia commonly are triggered by the introduction of a medication affecting potassium homeostasis; illness or dehydration also can be triggers. In patients with diabetic nephropathy, hyperkalemia may be caused by the syndrome of hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism. The presence of typical electrocardiographic changes or a rapid rise in serum potassium indicates that hyperkalemia is potentially life threatening. Urine potassium, creatinine, and osmolarity should be obtained as a first step in determining the cause of hyperkalemia, which directs long-term treatment. Intravenous calcium is effective in reversing electrocardiographic changes and reducing the risk of arrhythmias but does not lower serum potassium. Serum potassium levels can be lowered acutely by using intravenous insulin and glucose, nebulized beta2 agonists, or both. Sodium polystyrene therapy, sometimes with intravenous furosemide and saline, is then initiated to lower total body potassium levels.

### The management of hyperkalemia in patients with cardiovascular disease [^113km3w7]. The American Journal of Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

The development of hyperkalemia is common in patients with cardiac and kidney disease who are administered drugs that antagonize the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). As the results of large-scale clinical trials in hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and congestive heart failure demonstrate benefits of RAAS blockade alone or, in some cases, in combination therapies, the incidence of hyperkalemia has increased in clinical practice. Although there is potential for adverse events in the presence of hyperkalemia, there also are potential benefits of RAAS blockers that support their use in high-risk patient populations. Management of hyperkalemia may be improved by identifying the levels of potassium that may potentially induce harm and using appropriate strategies to avert the levels that may be dangerous or life threatening.

### Severe hyperkalemia requiring hospitalization: predictors of mortality [^116A99hS]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Severe hyperkalemia, requiring hospitalization and prompt treatment, occurs in patients with diverse medical conditions; precipitating factors also vary. The mortality rate increases in patients with greater differences between the admission and highest serum K + levels, in patients with MOF or cardiac arrest (or both) at the time of hyperkalemia diagnosis, in those with severe underlying diseases, in those with coexisting medical conditions, and in those who develop AKI from normal baseline renal function, as opposed to those with underlying CKD, with or without AKI.

Consequently, controlling and maintaining the serum K + level within a safe range have great importance in the clinical setting. Determining additional risk factors for severe hyperkalemia may be valuable and instructive to clinicians in the identification of high-risk patients and in the effective management of severe hyperkalemia.

Background

Hyperkalemia (HK) is a potentially life-threatening metabolic condition characterized by an increased serum concentration of potassium. Normal values of potassium have a range from 3.5 to 5 mmol/l, and hyperkalemia is defined by a value of ≥ 5.1 mmol/l; some authors prefer a low limit of 5.5 mmol/l.

Clinical symptoms of hyperkalemia are inconstant and unspecific (fatigue, muscular weakness), however, hyperkalemia can cause arrhythmia and heart arrest without pre-occurring clinical signs. The condition of hyperkalemia is usually detected in the context of routine laboratory screening. In the light of possibly life-threatening consequences, a finding of hyperkalemia implies an urgent demand for medical clarification and treatment.

The predominant risk factor of hyperkalemia is advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD). In patients with CKD ≥ 3 (GFR < 60 ml/min), the decreased ability to excrete potassium, especially in combination with diabetes mellitus and/or heart failure frequently results in recurrent and chronic hyperkalemia. Medication (e.g. non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID), renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS)-Inhibitors and lifestyle (irregular nutrition and circadian rhythm) are additional risk factors.

The true incidence and prevalence of hyperkalemia in the general population is not known, as there are no population-wide studies that examine it. A retrospective analysis based on a selected Canadian population (≥ 65 years) demonstrates that 2.6% of the individuals from the emergency department and 3.5% of the hospitalized patients were hyperkalemic. Further retrospective US researches deliver similar incidence rates between 2.5 and 3.2%. However, due to the low sensitivity, the true frequency in the general population is assumed to be considerably higher.

CONSEQUENCES OF HYPERKALEMIA

The most notorious consequence of hyperkalemia is that of potentially fatal cardiac dysrhythmia. However, there are several other consequences worthy of discussion. Hyperkalemia is associated with increased mortality (although we do not know whether hyperkalemia causes increased mortality outside of the context of cardiac arrhythmia in extreme hyperkalemia). Consequently, hyperkalemia — or the fear of hyperkalemia — may prompt changes in prescribing practice (e.g. avoiding RAS blockade and MRAs). Finally, recent data show that hyperkalemia can cause renal tubular acidosis and may contribute to peripheral neuropathy in CKD patients.

Mortality: epidemiology

Large observational studies demonstrate an association between hyperkalemia and an increased risk of death. In a meta-analysis of data from > 1.2 million individuals with CKD, serum [K +] exhibited a U-shaped relationship with all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, with a nadir at ∼4.2 mM. The adjusted hazard ratio for all-cause mortality was ∼1.22 for [K +] > 5.5 mM. This association persisted after adjustment for a large number of covariates. However, as there have been no large interventional studies testing the effects of potassium-lowering therapies (or of plasma [K +] targets) per se on mortality, we do not know whether this association is due to residual confounding (i.e. whether or not mild-to-moderate hyperkalemia causes an increased risk of death).

The most plausible mechanism whereby hyperkalemia could cause death is by the induction of fatal cardiac arrhythmia. In patients with acute myocardial infarction, hyperkalemia did indeed increase the risk of ventricular arrhythmias. However, there are some observations to suggest that any mortality risk associated with hyperkalemia cannot be solely attributed to arrhythmogenic death. For example, in a racially diverse population of community-dwelling older adults, hyperkalemia was not associated with sudden cardiac death, whereas it was associated with death from cancer and other non-cardiac causes. Moreover, adverse outcomes have been associated with higher plasma [K +] values that remain well within the reference range. Therefore we still have much to learn about the methodology of epidemiological studies in this area and/or the pathogenic consequences of hyperkalemia.

### Controversies in management of hyperkalemia [^114N7A4i]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Hyperkalemia is a common electrolyte disorder that can result in morbidity and mortality if not managed appropriately.

Objectives

This review evaluates the classic treatments of hyperkalemia and discusses controversies and new medications for management.

Discussion

Potassium (K+) plays a key role in determining the transmembrane potentials of "excitable membranes" present in nerve and muscle cells. K+ is the predominant intracellular cation, and clinical deterioration typically ensues when patients develop sufficiently marked elevation in extracellular fluid concentrations of K+ (hyperkalemia). Hyperkalemia is usually detected via serum clinical laboratory measurement. The most severe effect of hyperkalemia includes various cardiac dysrhythmias, which may result in cardiac arrest and death. Treatment includes measures to "stabilize" cardiac membranes, to shift K+ from extracellular to intracellular stores, and to promote K+ excretion. Calcium gluconate 10% dosed 10 mL intravenously should be provided for membrane stabilization, unless the patient is in cardiac arrest, in which case 10 mL calcium chloride is warranted. Beta-agonists and intravenous insulin should be given, and some experts recommend the use of synthetic short-acting insulins rather than regular insulin. Dextrose should also be administered, as indicated by initial and serial serum glucose measurements. Dialysis is the most efficient means to enable removal of excess K+. Loop and thiazide diuretics can also be useful. Sodium polystyrene sulfonate is not efficacious. New medications to promote gastrointestinal K+ excretion, which include patiromer and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate, hold promise.

Conclusions

Hyperkalemia can be deadly, and treatment requires specific measures including membrane stabilization, cellular shift, and excretion.

### Hyperkalemia in heart failure: foe or friend? [^1164YN3F]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

On the other hand, hyperkalemia has been associated with both increased and decreased mortality risk in various trials. 20, 28, 29, 30 This largely depends on the clinical substrate, that is, whether hyperkalemia is coming from renal dysfunction or due to potassium sparing drugs. The latter is associated with improved prognosis in specific populations and avoidance of hypokalemia. This may explain why a high potassium level may be protective especially in the long term. In contrast, in critically ill patients and in patients with chronic kidney disease, high potassium levels are associated with high rates of arrhythmias and cardiac arrest. Notwithstanding, published studies demonstrating an association of mortality with hyperkalemia are largely limited to retrospective analyses and have no design to provide evidence of causation.

Hoss et al. suggested that spironolactone and loop diuretic therapy appear to be safe in patients with high‐normal potassium levels, HF and reduced renal function and are associated with an improved outcome. 29

Serious hyperkalemia is common in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and accounts for considerable morbidity and death. Mechanisms of extrarenal disposal of potassium (gastrointestinal excretion and cellular uptake) play a crucial role in the defense against hyperkalemia in this population. In this article we review extrarenal potassium homeostasis and its alteration in patients with ESRD. We pay particular attention to the factors that influence the movement of potassium across cell membranes. With that background we discuss the emergency treatment of hyperkalemia in patients with ESRD. We conclude with a review of strategies to reduce the risk of hyperkalemia in this population of patients.

### A physiologic-based approach to the treatment of a patient with hypokalemia [^113NFDQ5]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Hypokalemia is common and can be associated with serious adverse consequences, including paralysis, ileus, cardiac arrhythmias, and death. As a result, the body maintains serum potassium concentration within very narrow limits by tightly regulated feedback and feed-forward systems. Whereas the consequences of symptomatic hypokalemia and severe potassium depletion are well appreciated, chronic mild hypokalemia can accelerate the progression of chronic kidney disease, exacerbate systemic hypertension, and increase mortality. Persistent hypokalemia may reflect total-body potassium depletion or increased renal potassium clearance. In a patient with simple potassium depletion, potassium replacement therapy should correct serum potassium concentration, but may have little effect when renal potassium clearance is abnormally increased from potassium wasting. In such cases, the addition of potassium-sparing diuretics might be helpful. Serum potassium concentration is an inaccurate marker of total-body potassium deficit. Mild hypokalemia may be associated with significant total-body potassium deficits and conversely, total-body potassium stores can be normal in patients with hypokalemia due to redistribution. The speed and extent of potassium replacement should be dictated by the clinical picture and guided by frequent reassessment of serum potassium concentration(.) The goals of therapy should be to correct a potassium deficit, if present, without provoking hyperkalemia. Oral replacement is preferred except when there is no functioning bowel or in the setting of electrocardiogram changes, neurologic symptoms, cardiac ischemia, or digitalis therapy.

KDIGO 2021 chronic kidney disease blood pressure management — managing hyperkalemia with RASi: Hyperkalemia associated with use of RASi can often be managed by measures to reduce the serum potassium levels rather than decreasing the dose or stopping RASi. In observational cohorts, hyperkalemia is often associated with a subsequent reduction in dose or discontinuation of RASi, and pseudo-hyperkalemia needs to be first ruled out. Strategies to control chronic hyperkalemia include dietary potassium restriction; discontinuation of potassium supplements, certain salt substitutes, and hyperkalemia drugs; adding potassium-wasting diuretics; and oral potassium binders, and in chronic kidney disease patients receiving RASi who develop hyperkalemia the latter can be controlled with newer oral potassium binders in many patients, with the effect that RASi can be continued at the recommended dose; side effects of oral potassium binders are reported to be moderate.

### Hyperkalemia in hospitalized patients… [^115YW31T]. JAMA Network (1998). Excellent credibility.

For 14 observation-only and 5 notification episodes, only an ECG obtained with hyperkalemia was available. The 12-lead tracings obtained with the hyperkalemic episodes were examined for the presence of rhythm disturbances, peaked T waves, or prolongation of PR or QRS intervals. The mean frequencies of hyperkalemic episodes were 1. 94 ± 1. 47 per day during the observation-only phase and

1. 61 ± 1. 40 per day during the notification phase. As the hospital census was 556 ± 38 and 477 ± 45 during the 2 phases, respectively, the incidence of new cases of hyperkalemia was similar during the 2 periods at 2. 4% for the observation-only phase,
2. 1% for the notification phase, and 2. 3% overall. During 85 of observation-only episodes and 76 of notification episodes, patients were placed on ECG monitors.

As there was a lower threshold for concluding that T waves were peaked when a comparison ECG was available, there was a tendency toward the more frequent occurrence of peaked T waves among the patients for whom paired 12-lead ECGs were available when compared with patients for whom only solitary 12-lead tracings were available. Six patients had a widened QRS complex, and 26 had peaked T waves. Overall, 33 tracings had any change suggestive of hyperkalemia, on the basis of physician review. The prevalence of ECG changes was independent of the severity of hyperkalemia. In patients with potassium values less than 6. 8 mmol/L, 23 of 54 tracings showed changes, whereas 10 of 18 tracings in patients with higher potassium values had characteristic hyperkalemic changes. In 1 report, all patients with potassium values above 6. 8 mmol/L had hyperkalemic changes, although those with intermediate elevations had a lower prevalence of ECG changes.

18, 19 Only 56% of tracings obtained in our patients with like potassium values were abnormal. This is consistent with more recent observations emphasizing the insensitivity of ECGs as a tool to diagnose even profound hyperkalemia. 20.

### Long-term mortality and trajectory of potassium measurements following an episode of acute severe hyperkalaemia [^115B7JKF]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2022). Medium credibility.

KEY LEARNING POINTS

What is already known about this subject?

severe hyperkalaemia is a potentially life-threatening condition associated with a higher risk of short-term adverse clinical events such as ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. Information about the long-term clinical consequences after an episode of severe hyperkalaemia remains scarce; and
we conducted a retrospective observational study that evaluated the long-term the trajectory of potassium and risk of mortality in patients with acute severe hyperkalaemia (K > 6 mEq/L).

What this study adds?

severe hyperkalaemia may occur in patients who did not have chronic kidney disease (25% of our patients);
after developing severe hyperkalaemia, recurrent hyperkalaemia is a frequent finding, especially during the first 6 months after the discharge;
following an acute severe hyperkalaemia episode, potassium trajectories predict the risk of death; and
during the post-discharge follow-up, transitioning from normal to higher potassium levels or persisting high values was associated with higher risk of death.

What impact this may have on practice or policy?

this study strengthens the importance of close clinical and potassium monitoring after an episode of acute hyperkalaemia; and
it reinforces the fact that new and well-tolerated treatments after discharge from a hyperkalaemia-related hospitalization should be strongly considered.

INTRODUCTION

The introduction of new potassium binders (patiromer and zirconium cyclosilicate) has refocused attention on hyperkalemia. There have also been significant recent advances in our understanding of the mechanisms that maintain potassium homoeostasis and the clinical consequences of hyperkalemia. In this article we aim to present these recent advances in the context of a concise review of the pathophysiology, risk factors and consequences of hyperkalemia. We will highlight aspects that are of particular relevance for clinical practice.

### Derangements of potassium [^115kCKyH]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Changes in potassium elimination, primarily due to the renal and GI systems, and shifting potassium between the intracellular and extracellular spaces cause potassium derangement. Symptoms are vague, but can be cardiac, musculoskeletal, or gastrointestinal. There are no absolute guidelines for when to treat, but it is generally recommended when the patient is symptomatic or has ECG changes. Treatment of hyperkalemia includes cardiac membrane stabilization with IV calcium, insulin and beta-antagonists to push potassium intracellularly, and dialysis. Neither sodium bicarbonate nor kayexelate are recommended. Treatment of symptomatic hypokalemia consists of PO or IV repletion with potassium chloride and magnesium sulfate.

This review article describes the pathophysiology and common aetiologies of hyperkalaemia including pseudohyperkalaemia, renal impairment, medication, rhabdomyolysis and aldosterone deficiency. Two clinical cases are used to describe symptoms (mainly muscle weakness and arrhythmias) and illustrate different management options. An approach to management including relevant investigations and interpretation of ECG changes is described. Emergency drug treatments are outlined and the effectiveness of individual therapeutic methods in reducing the potassium concentration described. Chronic management is mentioned but is outside the scope of this article. Hyperkalaemia is a rare but potentially life threatening emergency. It is a manifestation of a disease and therefore the incidence in children is not known. Quick and effective intervention may be necessary and clinicians must be adept at managing this condition. This overview provides two clinical scenarios and summarises aetiologies, investigations and management.

### Development and outcomes of hyperkalemia in hospitalized patients: potential implications for care [^117Jznpv]. American Heart Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

While severe hyperkalemia is commonly encountered, its manifestation in hospitalized patients and related outcomes are unclear. We aimed to examine development of hyperkalemia in hospitalized patients and associated outcomes.

Methods

Data from a county hospital electronic health record were used to assess all inpatient admissions, 2012–2016, for non-dialysis-dependent patients with ≥ 1 K value for development of hyperkalemia. Unadjusted odds ratios (ORs) were calculated for associations of the maximum K value with in-hospital mortality and adjusted ORs were calculated for death associated with hyperkalemia.

Results

In 47,018 individual patient hospitalizations, 1.3% had a maximum K ≥ 6.0 mEq/L and 4.2% < 3.5 mEq/L. Fifth and 95th percentiles for maximum K values were 3.5 and 5.3 mEq/L. For high-K patients with a prior K value, the mean (SD) of the immediate pre-maximum K value was 5.0 ± 1.0 mEq/L, and the mean difference in K values (immediate pre-maximum to maximum) was 1.5 ± 1.1 mEq/L; mean duration between these two K tests was 10.7 ± 14.9 hours. Compared with maximum K values 3.5 to 4.0 mEq/L, ORs for death were 37.1 (95% confidence intervals, 25.8–53.3) for K 6.0 to < 6.5, 88.6 (56.8–138.2) for K ≥ 7.0, and 18.9 (4.3–82.2) for K < 3.0 mEq/L. In adjusted models, the OR for death for K ≥ 6.0 mEq/L was 4.9 (3.7–6.4).

Discussion/Conclusions

Peak K values ≥ 6.0 mEq/L were associated with mortality. Values tended to increase rapidly, limiting opportunities for detection and treatment. Systems-based approaches to detect life-threatening hyperkalemia should be studied.

Hyperkalemia — definition, epidemiology, and initial considerations: Hyperkalemia is defined as "serum potassium concentration greater than 5.0 mEq/L in adults and greater than 5.5 mEq/L in children", and it "can lead to life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias and cardiac arrest". Among hospitalized adults, there is "a greater incidence of severe hyperkalemia (> 6.5 mEq/L), ranging from 1% to 10%". Risk factors "in both adults and children include impaired kidney function, potassium supplements, potassium-sparing diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), brisk hemolysis, and crush injuries". "Acidemia during cardiac arrest can also result in a falsely elevated potassium concentration, which may conflate the etiology of cardiac arrest", and "Laboratory confirmation is not required for initial treatment, although patient history and electrocardiogram changes can support suspicion of hyperkalemia as an underlying etiology".

### Management of hyperkalaemia in chronic kidney disease [^114C8jgq]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2014). Medium credibility.

Hyperkalaemia is common in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), in part because of the effects of kidney dysfunction on potassium homeostasis and in part because of the cluster of comorbidities (and their associated treatments) that occur in patients with CKD. Owing to its electrophysiological effects, severe hyperkalaemia represents a medical emergency that usually requires prompt intervention, whereas the prevention of hazardous hyperkalaemic episodes in at-risk patients requires measures aimed at the long-term normalization of potassium homeostasis. The options for effective and safe medical interventions to restore chronic potassium balance are few, and long-term management of hyperkalaemia is primarily limited to the correction of modifiable exacerbating factors. This situation can result in a difficult trade-off in patients with CKD, because drugs that are beneficial to these patients (for example, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system antagonists) are often the most prominent cause of their hyperkalaemia. Maintaining the use of these beneficial medications while implementing various strategies to control potassium balance is desirable; however, discontinuation rates remain high. The emergence of new medications that specifically target hyperkalaemia could lead to a therapeutic paradigm shift, emphasizing preventive management over ad hoc treatment of incidentally discovered elevations in serum potassium levels.

### Life-threatening hyperkalemia from nutritional supplements: uncommon or undiagnosed? [^116qJoqH]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Potassium chloride and other potassium compounds are used by the general public as salt substitutes, muscle-building supplements, and panacea. Severe hyperkalemia from oral potassium is extremely rare if kidney function is normal because of potassium adaptation. The oral potassium dose has to be large enough to overcome the normal renal excretory mechanisms to cause severe hyperkalemia. This occurs most commonly in patients with renal impairment or those who take potassium-sparing diuretics, angiotensin receptor blockers, or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. We present two unique cases of near-fatal hyperkalemia from nutritional supplements containing potassium. The first case was due to salt-substitute intake, whereas the second case was from a muscle-building supplement. Both patients suffered cardiac arrest, but were successfully resuscitated and survived. The acuity of intake and excessive quantity overwhelmed the kidneys' ability for adaptation. Potassium toxicity affects multiple organ systems and manifests in characteristic, acute cardiovascular changes with electrocardiographic abnormalities. Neuromuscular manifestations include general muscular weakness and ascending paralysis may occur, whereas gastrointestinal symptoms manifest as nausea, vomiting, paralytic ileus, and local mucosal necrosis that may lead to perforation. Once an urgent situation has been handled with intravenous push of a 10% calcium salt, short-term measures should be started with agents that cause a transcellular shift of potassium, namely, insulin with glucose, β2-agonist, and NaHCO(3). Patients are unaware of these potentially serious adverse effects, and there are inadequate consumer warnings. Clinicians should be vigilant in monitoring potassium intake from over-the-counter supplements.

### Severe hyperkalemia requiring hospitalization: predictors of mortality [^111cd3TY]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Potassium (K +) is a ubiquitous cation contained mostly within the intracellular fluid; only about 2% of total body K + is found in the extracellular fluid. In healthy humans, serum K + levels are tightly controlled within the narrow range of 3.5 to 5.0 mEq/L, thus retaining a normal ratio between the intracellular and extracellular compartments. This homeostasis plays a critical role in maintaining cellular resting membrane potential and neuromuscular function and is essential for normal activity of muscles, nerves, and the heart. Hyperkalemia, resulting from an imbalance in K + homeostasis, is defined as a serum K + level of greater than 5.0 mEq/L and is further classified as mild, moderate, or severe. It has been reported that drug therapy and impaired renal function are the main factors predisposing to the development of hyperkalemia.

Severe hyperkalemia (K + of at least 6.5 mEq/L) is a potentially life-threatening electrolyte disorder that has been reported to occur in 1% to 10% of all hospitalized patients, a higher percentage than that seen in outpatients. It is associated with electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities, including peaked T waves, shortened QT intervals, prolonged PR intervals, reduction in the amplitude of P waves, and 'sine-wave' ventricular rhythms with wide QRS complexes. Severe hyperkalemia eventually causes fatal arrhythmias such as ventricular fibrillation or asystole, leading to cardiac arrest. Severe hyperkalemia is a medical emergency and can lead to significant morbidity and mortality; it therefore requires hospitalization, ECG monitoring, and immediate treatment.

To promptly and effectively treat severe hyperkalemia, it is important to know the risk factors, the clinical manifestations, the therapeutic approaches, and the factors that predict both mortality and improvement in this disorder. Although most of these factors are well documented, reliable predictors of clinical outcomes such as in-hospital mortality have not been established. We therefore designed this study to identify common factors predisposing to severe hyperkalemia and to analyze the relationship between serum K + levels and clinical outcomes, including in-hospital mortality. Furthermore, we attempted to determine the association between in-hospital mortality and multiple clinical factors in patients with severe hyperkalemia.
