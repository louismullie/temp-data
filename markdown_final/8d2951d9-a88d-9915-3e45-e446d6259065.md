## Question

how to initaite treatment for hypothyroidism

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to initiate treatment for hypothyroidism. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and distinguishing overt from subclinical disease. Then, I should verify the standard of care and formulation choice. Next, I will stratify dosing by patient factors such as age, cardiac status, pregnancy, and etiology. After that, I need to outline monitoring intervals and titration targets. Finally, I should consider special populations and summarize a practical algorithm with safety checks and follow-up plans.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and classification, because I need to ensure we are treating true hypothyroidism rather than a lab anomaly. Overt primary hypothyroidism is defined by an elevated TSH with low free T4, whereas subclinical hypothyroidism is an elevated TSH with normal free T4; central hypothyroidism presents with low or inappropriately normal TSH and low free T4, and in that case TSH cannot guide dosing, so I should not jump to conclusions about using TSH targets in central disease [^07a7b05d] [^b8c254df].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about treatment thresholds in subclinical disease. I should double-check guideline positions. The BMJ 2019 guideline issues a strong recommendation against routine thyroid hormone therapy in adults with subclinical hypothyroidism, citing no clinically meaningful benefits on quality of life or symptoms, so I should avoid treating subclinical disease except in defined scenarios such as pregnancy planning, TSH above 10 mIU/L, or specific cardiovascular risk contexts, and I should document shared decision-making when treatment is deferred [^2efef722] [^620a8696] [^3bede807].

> Next, I should review the standard of care and formulation. Levothyroxine monotherapy remains first-line therapy, and I need to ensure I am not substituting desiccated thyroid or combination T4/T3 as initial therapy, since major guidelines do not support these alternatives for routine care and combination therapy has not shown consistent superiority in randomized trials [^32bb595b] [^74252fa7] [^4bde2cf9].

> I will now examine dosing for healthy adults with overt primary hypothyroidism. A full replacement approach of about 1.6 mcg/kg/day is reasonable in young, healthy patients without cardiac disease, and I should remember that this estimate includes the assumption of minimal endogenous thyroid function; wait, let me verify the conversion — yes, that approximates 0.73 mcg/lb/day, and I should adjust downward if there is residual thyroid function or if the patient is already on a partial dose [^dd726a0c] [^0af3b4a3].

> But wait, what if the patient is older or has cardiac disease? I should confirm that a conservative start is safer. In patients over 65 or with coronary artery disease, I should start low, typically 25–50 mcg/day, and titrate by 12.5–25 mcg increments every 4–6 weeks to minimize ischemia or arrhythmias from abrupt increases in metabolic demand; I need to ensure I am not exceeding what the heart can tolerate in this population [^07a7b05d] [^95d0aac6] [^4bde2cf9].

> Let me consider pregnancy, because this is a high-stakes scenario. In overt hypothyroidism diagnosed during pregnancy, I should initiate levothyroxine promptly at about 1.6 mcg/kg/day and recheck TSH every 4 weeks through gestation, targeting trimester-specific ranges; if the patient is already on levothyroxine, I should increase the total weekly dose by about 30% as soon as pregnancy is confirmed, and I should coordinate with obstetrics for ongoing monitoring [^2291f167] [^2291f167] [^2291f167].

> I should confirm the approach to subclinical hypothyroidism in pregnancy. Treatment is generally recommended when TSH is above the pregnancy-specific upper limit with positive anti-TPO antibodies, or when TSH is 10 mIU/L or higher regardless of antibody status, using lower starting doses such as 1.0–1.2 mcg/kg/day and reassessing every 4 weeks; I need to ensure I am aligning with both endocrine and obstetric guidance here [^4e74a559] [^0bceb4b6] [^2291f167].

> Now, for infants with congenital hypothyroidism, I need to act urgently. I should initiate levothyroxine at 10–15 mcg/kg/day as soon as possible, ideally within 2 weeks of life, and recheck TSH and free T4 in about 2 weeks to adjust the dose; rapid normalization of free T4 is critical for neurocognitive outcomes, so I should not underdose or delay in this population [^7650e7bb] [^217105a7] [^04dc5251].

> For children and adolescents with acquired hypothyroidism, I should dose by weight and age band, typically 4–6 mcg/kg/day for ages 1–3, 3–5 mcg/kg/day for 3–10, and 2–4 mcg/kg/day for 10–16, with adjustments based on growth and pubertal status; I need to ensure I am not extrapolating adult dosing to pediatrics, as requirements differ with development [^9911f5c2].

> Let me think about central hypothyroidism, because I should not rely on TSH to titrate. I should target free T4 in the mid–upper reference range and start around 1.6 mcg/kg/day, adjusting to clinical response and free T4; importantly, I must rule out or treat adrenal insufficiency before starting levothyroxine to avoid precipitating adrenal crisis, so I should confirm cortisol status first [^b8c254df] [^a6af3c14].

> Next, I should review monitoring and titration. After any dose change, I will recheck TSH in 4–6 weeks for primary hypothyroidism, adjusting by 12.5–25 mcg increments until TSH is in the reference range, then monitor every 6–12 months once stable; in older adults, I should consider accepting a slightly higher TSH target, even 4–6 mIU/L in those over 70–80, to balance risks and benefits, and I should double-check for drug interactions that impair absorption or increase metabolism, remeasuring TSH 4–8 weeks after starting such agents [^07a7b05d] [^28946c71] [^38c3d88f].

> I should confirm administration details to optimize absorption. Levothyroxine should be taken fasting, 30–60 minutes before breakfast, with water only, and separated from calcium, iron, bile acid sequestrants, sucralfate, and some foods; if adherence is a concern, a weekly dose can be used in select cases, but I need to ensure consistent timing and separation from interfering substances [^27b67d88] [^63e40701] [^28946c71] [^38c3d88f].

> Hold on, I should verify special scenarios. In postpartum thyroiditis, I will treat symptomatic hypothyroidism and consider discontinuing levothyroxine around 12 months postpartum with reassessment, given the high rate of recovery; in amiodarone-induced hypothyroidism, I should treat overt cases and monitor subclinical cases closely; and in nonthyroidal illness, I should avoid initiating thyroid hormone replacement in ICU settings because trials have not shown benefit and may show harm [^5194736d] [^943eca3b] [^9cc9f9ad].

> Let me reconsider the practical algorithm to ensure nothing is missing. Confirm diagnosis and classify overt versus subclinical and primary versus central; choose levothyroxine monotherapy; calculate dose using 1.6 mcg/kg/day for healthy adults with overt disease, reduce to 25–50 mcg/day if older or cardiac; use 1.6 mcg/kg/day in pregnancy with urgent initiation and frequent monitoring; use weight-based pediatric dosing with early normalization targets; start low and go slow in older or cardiac patients; monitor TSH every 4–6 weeks until stable, then every 6–12 months; and adjust for interactions, adherence, and life changes such as weight shifts or new medications [^07a7b05d] [^1be19404] [^7650e7bb].

> Finally, I need to ensure safety and follow-up are explicit. I should counsel on adherence, storage, and administration, warn about symptoms of overtreatment such as palpitations or insomnia, and arrange periodic reassessment of dose needs over time, recognizing that requirements may fall with age or rise with pregnancy, malabsorption, or enzyme-inducing drugs; if symptoms persist despite normalized TSH, I should evaluate for alternative diagnoses before changing thyroid therapy [^98fab8f2] [^b2c45664].

Initiate levothyroxine for confirmed overt hypothyroidism [^7fda9e7c], tailoring the dose to age, cardiac status, and comorbidities [^5f6f35a9]. Start **full replacement at 1.6 mcg/kg/day** in healthy adults [^dd726a0c]; use 25–50 mcg/day in older adults or those with cardiac disease, titrating by 12.5–25 mcg every 4–6 weeks to a TSH of 0.5–2.5 mIU/L [^07a7b05d] [^4bde2cf9]. In pregnancy, start immediately at 1.6 mcg/kg/day and increase by 30% as soon as pregnancy is confirmed, monitoring TSH every 4 weeks [^1be19404] [^2291f167]. For subclinical hypothyroidism, treat if TSH ≥ 10 mIU/L or if symptoms, positive TPOAb, or cardiovascular risk factors are present; otherwise monitor [^3bede807] [^79d492f2]. Recheck TSH 4–6 weeks after any dose change and adjust until stable, then monitor annually [^07a7b05d] [^7c400ceb].

---

## Confirming the diagnosis

Before initiating therapy, **confirm hypothyroidism** with biochemical testing:

- **Primary hypothyroidism**: Elevated TSH with low free T4 [^notfound].
- **Subclinical hypothyroidism**: Elevated TSH with normal free T4 [^22fb1b8f].
- **Central hypothyroidism**: Low or inappropriately normal TSH with low free T4 [^notfound].

---

## General principles of levothyroxine therapy

Levothyroxine is the **standard of care** for hypothyroidism replacement [^74252fa7]. It is a synthetic form of T4 that is converted to T3 in peripheral tissues, restoring normal thyroid hormone levels [^notfound]. The goals of therapy are to normalize TSH, relieve symptoms, and prevent complications such as cardiovascular disease and infertility [^bea839c9].

---

## Initial dosing considerations

Several factors influence the **initial levothyroxine dose**:

- **Age and cardiac status**: Older adults or those with cardiac disease require lower starting doses due to increased sensitivity to thyroid hormone [^07a7b05d].
- **Body weight**: Dosing is typically weight-based, with adjustments for lean body mass and obesity [^5f6f35a9].
- **Etiology**: Patients with total thyroidectomy or radioiodine ablation may require higher doses than those with autoimmune thyroiditis [^0af3b4a3].
- **Pregnancy**: Requires higher doses due to increased thyroid hormone requirements [^1be19404].

---

## Recommended initial dosing strategies

| **Patient population** | **Recommended initial dose** | **Notes** |
|-|-|-|
| Healthy adults (≤ 65 years) | 1.6 mcg/kg/day (full replacement) | Adjust based on lean body mass and clinical context [^5f6f35a9] |
| Older adults (> 65 years) or cardiac disease | 25–50 mcg/day | Titrate slowly every 4–6 weeks [^07a7b05d] |
| Pregnancy | 1.6 mcg/kg/day | Increase by 30% immediately upon confirmation of pregnancy [^notfound] |
| Subclinical hypothyroidism (TSH 4.5–10 mIU/L) | 25–75 mcg/day | Treat if symptomatic, positive TPOAb, or cardiovascular risk factors [^3bede807] |
| Subclinical hypothyroidism (TSH > 10 mIU/L) | 50–100 mcg/day | Strong indication for treatment [^3bede807] |

---

## Special considerations

### Pregnancy

Pregnancy requires **immediate initiation** of levothyroxine at 1.6 mcg/kg/day, with a 30% dose increase as soon as pregnancy is confirmed [^1be19404] [^07a819ce]. Monitor TSH every 4 weeks during the first trimester and adjust the dose to maintain trimester-specific TSH targets [^1be19404].

---

### Elderly patients and those with cardiac disease

Start low and titrate slowly to avoid precipitating **cardiac ischemia or arrhythmias** [^07a7b05d]. A typical starting dose is 25–50 mcg/day, with increments of 12.5–25 mcg every 4–6 weeks [^07a7b05d].

---

### Subclinical hypothyroidism

Treatment is indicated when **TSH is ≥ 10 mIU/L** or when TSH is 4.5–10 mIU/L with symptoms, positive TPOAb, or cardiovascular risk factors [^3bede807]. Otherwise, monitor TSH every 6–12 months [^notfound].

---

## Monitoring and dose adjustment

- **Initial monitoring**: Measure TSH 4–6 weeks after starting therapy or changing the dose [^07a7b05d].
- **Dose adjustment**: Adjust by 12.5–25 mcg increments until TSH is within the target range (typically 0.5–2.5 mIU/L) [^07a7b05d].
- **Stable patients**: Monitor TSH every 6–12 months once stable [^7c400ceb].

---

## Potential pitfalls and considerations

- **Drug interactions**: Calcium, iron, and proton pump inhibitors can impair levothyroxine absorption; separate dosing by at least 4 hours [^notfound].
- **Adherence**: Consistent daily administration and fasting intake improve absorption and stability [^notfound].
- **Overtreatment**: Avoid excessive dosing to prevent osteoporosis and atrial fibrillation [^notfound].

---

Initiating hypothyroidism treatment requires **confirming the diagnosis**, selecting an appropriate levothyroxine dose based on age, cardiac status, and comorbidities, and monitoring TSH to guide titration. Special populations, such as pregnant women, older adults, and those with cardiac disease, require tailored dosing and careful monitoring.

Children with subclinical hypothyroidism — many clinicians consider it reasonable to initiate levothyroxine to avoid potential risk to growth and development, but treatment is generally not recommended when thyrotropin is 5–10 mIU/L; for thyrotropin > 10 mIU/L with signs and symptoms of primary thyroid disease and/or risk factors for progression, levothyroxine may be reasonable. Weak recommendation. Low-quality evidence.

### Thyroiditis: evaluation and treatment… [^5194736d]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

TREATMENT All patients with HT and hypothyroidism require treatment, even if they are asymptomatic. The goals of treatment include normalizing the TSH level and ameliorating symptoms of hypothyroidism. When deciding on the initial replacement dose of levothyroxine, the patient's age and cardiac status should be considered. A healthy, young patient without coexisting heart disease can be started on a full replacement dosage of levothyroxine. 3 is not routinely recommended. The patient's TSH level should be remeasured four to six weeks after initiation and the dose of levothyroxine adjusted to achieve a value in the normal reference range. Clinicians may try to achieve slightly higher TSH levels in older patients. It is reasonable to make dosage adjustments of 12. 5 to 25 mcg of levothyroxine per day at four- to six-week intervals until the intended TSH level is reached.

In patients with subclinical hypothyroidism and elevated TPO antibodies, especially those with a serum TSH level of at least 10 mIU per L or with symptoms, treatment with low-dose levothyroxine should be considered. An initial dosage of 25 to 50 mcg per day can be established and titrated in these patients similarly to patients who have overt hypothyroidism. If therapy with levothyroxine is not initiated, patients should be monitored annually for the development of overt hypothyroidism. 15, 19. It is recommended to begin tapering the levothyroxine dose around 12 months postpartum if the patient is not pregnant, attempting to conceive, or breastfeeding, followed by periodic monitoring of thyroid function. The eventual development of permanent hypothyroidism has been described in 15% to 50% of patients with a history of postpartum thyroiditis. 12 Prednisone in dosages of 15 to 40 mg per day has been proposed for one to six weeks, followed by tapering dosages of 5 mg every two weeks.

12, 13, 23 During the transient hypothyroid phase, thyroid hormone supplementation is used for patients with signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism or in patients of reproductive age who wish to become pregnant. Levothyroxine should be used for 12 months and may then be discontinued because subacute thyroiditis is generally self-limited. 12.

Clinical Question

What are the benefits and harms of thyroid hormones for adults with subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH)? This guideline was triggered by a recent systematic review of randomised controlled trials, which could alter practice.

Current Practice

Current guidelines tend to recommend thyroid hormones for adults with thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels > 10 mIU/L and for people with lower TSH values who are young, symptomatic, or have specific indications for prescribing.

Recommendation

The guideline panel issues a strong recommendation against thyroid hormones in adults with SCH (elevated TSH levels and normal free T4 (thyroxine) levels). It does not apply to women who are trying to become pregnant or patients with TSH > 20 mIU/L. It may not apply to patients with severe symptoms or young adults (such as those ≤ 30 years old).

How This Guideline Was Created

A guideline panel including patients, clinicians, and methodologists produced this recommendation in adherence with standards for trustworthy guidelines using the GRADE approach.

The Evidence

The systematic review included 21 trials with 2192 participants. For adults with SCH, thyroid hormones consistently demonstrate no clinically relevant benefits for quality of life or thyroid related symptoms, including depressive symptoms, fatigue, and body mass index (moderate to high quality evidence). Thyroid hormones may have little or no effect on cardiovascular events or mortality (low quality evidence), but harms were measured in only one trial with few events at two years' follow-up.

Understanding The Recommendation

The panel concluded that almost all adults with SCH would not benefit from treatment with thyroid hormones. Other factors in the strong recommendation include the burden of lifelong management and uncertainty on potential harms. Instead, clinicians should monitor the progression or resolution of the thyroid dysfunction in these adults. Recommendations are made actionable for clinicians and their patients through visual overviews. These provide the relative and absolute benefits and harms of thyroid hormones in multilayered evidence summaries and decision aids available in MAGIC (https://app.magicapp.org/) to support shared decisions and adaptation of this guideline.

### Optimal thyroid hormone replacement [^b2c45664]. Endocrine Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Hypothyroidism is a common endocrinopathy, and levothyroxine is frequently prescribed. Despite the basic tenets of initiating and adjusting levothyroxine being agreed on, there are many nuances and complexities to consistently maintaining euthyroidism. Understanding the impact of patient weight and residual thyroid function on initial levothyroxine dosage and consideration of age, comorbidities, thyrotropin goal, life stage, and quality of life as levothyroxine is adjusted can be challenging and continually evolving. Because levothyroxine is a lifelong medication, it is important to avoid risks from periods of overtreatment or undertreatment. For the subset of patients not restored to baseline health with levothyroxine, causes arising from all aspects of the patient's life (coexistent medical conditions, stressors, lifestyle, psychosocial factors) should be broadly considered. If such factors do not appear to be contributing, and biochemical euthyroidism has been successfully maintained, there may be benefit to a trial of combination therapy with levothyroxine and liothyronine. This is not supported by the majority of randomized clinical trials, but may be supported by other studies providing lower-quality evidence and by animal studies. Given this discrepancy, it is important that any trial of combination therapy be continued only as long as a patient benefit is being enjoyed. Monitoring for adverse effects, particularly in older or frail individuals, is necessary and combination therapy should not be used during pregnancy. A sustained-release liothyronine preparation has completed phase 1 testing and may soon be available for better designed and powered studies assessing whether combination therapy provides superior therapy for hypothyroidism.

Levothyroxine dosage — starting dose determinants: When deciding on a starting dose of levothyroxine, the patient's weight, lean body mass, pregnancy status, etiology of hypothyroidism, degree of thyrotropin elevation, age, and general clinical context, including the presence of cardiac disease, should all be considered, and the serum thyrotropin goal appropriate for the clinical situation should also be considered. Strong recommendation. Moderate quality evidence.

### Hypothyroidism: diagnosis and treatment… [^4bde2cf9]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

Thyroid hormone has known inotropic effects on cardiac tissue and can increase myocardial oxygen demand. For older patients or those with coronary artery disease, levothyroxine therapy should be started at 25 to 50 mcg per day, with titration of 25 mcg every three to four weeks until a target dosage is achieved to decrease the potential for adverse effects from thyroid excess. Adding T 3 to levothyroxine does not additionally alleviate symptoms of hypothyroidism. A meta-analysis of 11 randomized trials found no difference in symptoms or quality of life in patients treated with levothyroxine monotherapy vs. levothyroxine plus combination therapy. 32 The American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists does not recommend desiccated thyroid hormone and finds insufficient evidence to recommend combination levothyroxine/T 3 therapy over levothyroxine monotherapy. 3, or both.

25 Levothyroxine should be given as a slow intravenous bolus of 200 to 400 mcg initially, followed by 50 to 100 mcg orally per day. Reduce dosing by 75% if it is being administered intravenously. The TSH level should drop by 50% per week on adequate treatment. After clinical improvement, the patient may transition to oral levothyroxine monotherapy. 21, 25. Subclinical hypothyroidism is common in patients 65 years and older. Despite observed associations with depression, cognitive impairment, hyperlipidemia, and coronary artery disease, there is no evidence that treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism improves outcomes. A study of 737 patients who were 65 years and older with subclinical hypothyroidism found no improvement in quality of life or clinical outcomes with levothyroxine titrated to achieve a normal TSH level compared with patients who received placebo with sham titration.

7 In patients 65 years and older with subclinical hypothyroidism and TSH levels less than 10 mIU per L, treatment with levothyroxine can increase mortality. 35 The benefit of treating subclinical hypothyroidism in many populations is uncertain. One randomized controlled trial found that treating middle-aged adults with levothyroxine compared with a control medication decreased tiredness.

Clinical practice guidelines for hypothyroidism in adults — Fifty-two evidence-based recommendations and subrecommendations were developed to aid in the care of patients with hypothyroidism. A serum thyrotropin is the single best screening test for primary thyroid dysfunction for the vast majority of outpatient clinical situations. The standard treatment is replacement with L-thyroxine. The decision to treat subclinical hypothyroidism when the serum thyrotropin is less than 10 mIU/L should be tailored to the individual patient.

Discussion of the clinical literature — elderly hypothyroidism management indicates that in elderly persons (those older than 65–70 years) who are without known heart disease or without major risk factors for heart disease, LT4 therapy can be initiated at the full dose, although the method of starting with a low dose and increasing it slowly is still preferred by some experts. The final LT4 dose that normalizes the serum TSH is generally lower in the elderly compared to younger persons. In addition to the lower dose requirements related to T4 metabolism, the target serum TSH should likely be raised in older persons, especially the oldest old (patients > 80 years), and, based on current evidence, it is reasonable to raise the target serum TSH to 4–6 mIU/L in persons greater than age 70–80 years. If maintaining a regular daily schedule of LT4 therapy is problematic in an elderly individual, consideration could be given to a guardian or visiting nurse giving all the LT4 pills once weekly (or half the pills twice weekly), if appropriate.

Levothyroxine dosing and monitoring — primary hypothyroidism: Except in secondary (central) hypothyroidism, dose titration is guided by serum thyrotropin (TSH), with the "target TSH typically being 0.5 to 3.5 or 4 mIU/L". "Dose adjustments are usually made 4–6 weeks after initiating therapy", typically in increments of "12.5–25 μg/d", and "the serum TSH is then repeated in 4–6 weeks, until the TSH target has been reached". Ongoing monitoring is advised as "serum TSH should be measured in 4–6 months and then at 12 months to assure stability". In patients with coronary artery disease, initiation should be conservative: "Patients with known coronary artery disease (CAD) should always be started on a low LT4 dose (12.5–25 μg/d), with gradual increases based on symptoms and serum TSH levels".

### Subclinical thyroid disease: clinical applications [^22fb1b8f]. JAMA (2004). Excellent credibility.

Subclinical hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism are diagnoses based on laboratory evaluation with few if any clinical signs or symptoms. Subclinical hypothyroidism is defined as an elevation in serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) above the upper limit of the reference range (0.45–4.5 mIU/L) with normal serum FT4 concentration; subclinical hyperthyroidism is defined as a decrease in serum TSH below the reference range with normal serum FT4 and T3 concentrations. Though these conditions represent the earliest stages of thyroid dysfunction, the benefits of detecting and treating subclinical thyroid disease are not well established. Most persons found to have subclinical thyroid disease will have TSH values between 0.1 and 0.45 mIU/L or between 4.5 and 10 mIU/L, for which the benefits of treatment are not clearly established; treatment may be beneficial in individuals with serum TSH lower than 0.1 mIU/L or higher than 10 mIU/L. This article illustrates approaches to managing patients with subclinical hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism through 5 case scenarios that apply the principles of evidence-based medicine. Because of the substantial uncertainty concerning the consequences of untreated subclinical hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism, as well as the benefit of initiating treatment, patient preferences are important in deciding on management of subclinical disease.

While TSH levels may decline within a month of initiating therapy with doses of L‑thyroxine such as 50 or 75 μg, making adjustments with smaller doses may require 8 weeks or longer before TSH levels begin to plateau, and increment changes of 12.5–25 μg are initially made. Once an adequate replacement dosage has been determined, periodic follow‑up evaluations with repeat TSH testing at 6‑month and then 12‑month intervals are appropriate, and some clinical manifestations of hypothyroidism may take up to 3–6 months to resolve after serum TSH has returned to normal.

### Thyroid hormone treatment among pregnant women with subclinical hypothyroidism: US national assessment [^9049c706]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions

To facilitate the decision making process for pregnant women with subclinical hypothyroidism, clinicians are encouraged to use a shared decision making approach. With this approach, clinicians can discuss with patients the uncertainty behind our treatment recommendations and explore what is important to them when making decisions about their health with the goal of reaching a decision about treatment that best fits their situation. The timing of thyroid hormone initiation is another important area of research. Given that the observed benefit of thyroid hormone use was related to decreased risk of pregnancy loss, an event most commonly occurring in early pregnancy, treatment may be needed only in the first trimester of pregnancy. Finally, if treatment is started, monitoring of thyroid function and adjustment of treatment dose are essential.

In conclusion, this is the first national study to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of thyroid hormone for pregnant women with subclinical hypothyroidism. Thyroid hormone use was associated with a decreased risk of pregnancy loss in this population, especially those with TSH concentrations of 4.1–10 mIU/L. Further research is needed to understand whether a causal mechanism exists behind this association. In addition, the increased risk of other adverse outcomes calls for randomized trials evaluating the safety of thyroid hormone treatment in this population. These results could facilitate an informed conversation between patients and clinicians about starting thyroid hormone treatment.

Background

A number of recent advances in our understanding of thyroid physiology may shed light on why some patients feel unwell while taking levothyroxine monotherapy. The purpose of this task force was to review the goals of levothyroxine therapy, the optimal prescription of conventional levothyroxine therapy, the sources of dissatisfaction with levothyroxine therapy, the evidence on treatment alternatives, and the relevant knowledge gaps. We wished to determine whether there are sufficient new data generated by well-designed studies to provide reason to pursue such therapies and change the current standard of care. This document is intended to inform clinical decision-making on thyroid hormone replacement therapy; it is not a replacement for individualized clinical judgment.

Methods

Task force members identified 24 questions relevant to the treatment of hypothyroidism. The clinical literature relating to each question was then reviewed. Clinical reviews were supplemented, when relevant, with related mechanistic and bench research literature reviews, performed by our team of translational scientists. Ethics reviews were provided, when relevant, by a bioethicist. The responses to questions were formatted, when possible, in the form of a formal clinical recommendation statement. When responses were not suitable for a formal clinical recommendation, a summary response statement without a formal clinical recommendation was developed. For clinical recommendations, the supporting evidence was appraised, and the strength of each clinical recommendation was assessed, using the American College of Physicians system. The final document was organized so that each topic is introduced with a question, followed by a formal clinical recommendation. Stakeholder input was received at a national meeting, with some subsequent refinement of the clinical questions addressed in the document. Consensus was achieved for all recommendations by the task force.

Results

We reviewed the following therapeutic categories: (i) levothyroxine therapy, (ii) non-levothyroxine-based thyroid hormone therapies, and (iii) use of thyroid hormone analogs. The second category included thyroid extracts, synthetic combination therapy, triiodothyronine therapy, and compounded thyroid hormones.

Conclusions

We concluded that levothyroxine should remain the standard of care for treating hypothyroidism. We found no consistently strong evidence for the superiority of alternative preparations (e.g., levothyroxine-liothyronine combination therapy, or thyroid extract therapy, or others) over monotherapy with levothyroxine, in improving health outcomes. Some examples of future research needs include the development of superior biomarkers of euthyroidism to supplement thyrotropin measurements, mechanistic research on serum triiodothyronine levels (including effects of age and disease status, relationship with tissue concentrations, as well as potential therapeutic targeting), and long-term outcome clinical trials testing combination therapy or thyroid extracts (including subgroup effects). Additional research is also needed to develop thyroid hormone analogs with a favorable benefit to risk profile.

### Congenital hypothyroidism: screening and management [^07a2965b]. Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Congenital hypothyroidism — treatment goals, targets, and early adjustments emphasize that the goal of initial L‑T4 therapy is to normalize serum FT4 and TSH concentrations as quickly as possible, with optimal outcome depending on early initiation of adequate L‑T4 treatment (generally by 2 weeks of life when detected with the first NBS); normalization of serum TSH may lag; in infants 1 to 3 months of age the upper limit of normal TSH is 4.1 to 4.8 mIU/L, therefore TSH values above 5 mIU/L generally are abnormal if observed after 3 months of age; the typical L‑T4 starting dose (10–15 mcg/kg per day) frequently results in elevated FT4 levels so dose reduction is often needed 2 weeks after starting; and whether overtreatment (defined by elevated serum FT4) is harmful remains unclear and evidence is conflicting.

### Management of primary hypothyroidism: statement by the British thyroid association executive committee [^220cbadb]. Clinical Endocrinology (2016). Low credibility.

The management of primary hypothyroidism with levothyroxine (L-T4) is simple, effective and safe, and most patients report improved well-being on initiation of treatment. However, a proportion of individuals continue to suffer with symptoms despite achieving adequate biochemical correction. The management of such individuals has been the subject of controversy and of considerable public interest. The American Thyroid Association (ATA) and the European Thyroid Association (ETA) have recently published guidelines on the diagnosis and management of hypothyroidism. These guidelines have been based on extensive reviews of the medical literature and include sections on the role of combination therapy with L-T4 and liothyronine (L-T3) in individuals who are persistently dissatisfied with L-T4 therapy. This position statement by the British Thyroid Association (BTA) summarises the key points in these guidelines and makes recommendations on the management of primary hypothyroidism based on the current literature, review of the published positions of the ETA and ATA, and in line with best principles of good medical practice. The statement is endorsed by the Association of Clinical Biochemistry, (ACB), British Thyroid Foundation, (BTF), Royal College of Physicians (RCP) and Society for Endocrinology (SFE).

### Levothyroxine starting dose in primary hypothyroid… [^057c9e68]. AAFP (2006). Low credibility.

Primary hypothyroidism is a common medical disorder that usually presents secondary to autoimmune thyroiditis. Symptoms of hypothyroidism include fatigue, weight gain, cold intolerance, and constipation. Treatment of hypothyroidism with levothyroxine is effective, but starting doses vary. There are two strategies for initiating levothyroxine in healthy adults younger than 65 years: low-dose and full-dose. Traditionally, lower starting doses of 25 to 50 mcg per day are recommended for patients 65 years and older or who have ischemic heart disease. Low-dose initiation of thyroid supplementation usually takes four to six months before plasma thyrotropin and free thyroxine levels become normal. Roos and associates compared the full starting dose of levothyroxine with the low dose in individuals with primary hypothyroidism without known cardiac disease. Patients were excluded if they had a history of cardiac disease or were taking cardiac medication.

Patients were randomly assigned to receive a starting levothyroxine dosage of 25 mcg per day or 1. 6 mcg per kg per day. Levothyroxine doses were adjusted by 25 mcg every four weeks until 24 weeks. Doses then were adjusted every 12 weeks with the goal of maintaining serum thyrotropin and FT. Twenty-five patients were randomly assigned to the low-dose group and 25 to the high-dose group. The two groups were similar in severity of hypothyroidism and age. At week four, 13 patients reached euthyroid levels in the high-dose group compared with one in the low-dose group. This trend persisted until week 24, when 21 in the high-dose group and 20 in the low-dose group met the criteria for being euthyroid. The rate of change in clinical scores and quality of life were similar between the two groups. Body weight, heart rate, and blood pressure were unchanged in both groups. There were no palpitations, angina pectoris, or other cardiac events documented in either group.

The authors conclude that starting healthy primary hypothyroid patients on a full dose of levothyroxine is safe and effective for those who do not have a history of cardiac disease. They add that this strategy may be more convenient and cost effective than the method of starting low and titrating slowly.

### ETA guidelines for the use of levothyroxine sodium preparations in monotherapy to optimize the treatment of hypothyroidism [^83f9130c]. European Thyroid Journal (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for hypothyroidism, more specifically with respect to levothyroxine therapy, initial dosing, ETA 2025 guidelines recommend to consider determining the starting dose of levothyroxine and calculating the daily requirement by evaluating the patient's weight, lean body mass, pregnancy status, etiology of hypothyroidism, age, and overall clinical context.

### Levothyroxine monotherapy: what works better for the individual with hypothyroidism? [^8ff88d78]. Endocrine Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

I explore objective data not supporting the addition of liothyronine (medication) (LT3) to levothyroxine (medication) (LT4) in patients with hypothyroidism. Accurate identification of patients with symptomatic (almost exclusively overt) hypothyroidism is important in evaluating clinical outcomes of therapies. Recent studies have documented that nearly a third of individuals who are offered thyroid hormone are euthyroid at the time of initiation. Additionally, others are clinically diagnosed without biochemical confirmation, so a sizable proportion of those started on LT4 are not hypothyroid. The assumption that nonhypothyroid symptoms will resolve with LT4 is problematic. The true underlying cause of these symptoms remains unidentified and untreated.

Methods

In a narrative fashion I will review the positive predictive value of and correlation of symptoms consistent with hypothyroidism and confirmed hypothyroidism likely to favorably respond to thyroid hormone replacement.

Results

Following a review of the reliability of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) in predicting a euthyroid state, the correlation of circulating triiodothyronine (serum measurement) (T3) levels with symptoms and predictive value of T3 to forecast the outcome of adding LT3 to LT4 will be reviewed. The utility of striving for high, middle, or low TSH set points within the expected range to predict changes in clinical quality of life and the ability of blinded patients to sense subtle differences along this spectrum will be documented. In addition, the clinical impact of single nucleotide polymorphisms in the type 2 deiodinase gene will be reviewed. Finally, the overall satisfaction of selected patients with their thyroid hormone treatments will be outlined and preferences for T3-containing treatments from blinded studies will be summarized.

Conclusion

Basing thyroid hormone treatment decisions on patient symptoms likely results in missed diagnoses We should encourage primary care physicians to assess a differential diagnosis, exclude other diagnoses, and not assume a thyroid etiology when TSH is normal. Modifying treatment to a particular TSH target or adjusting based on a low T3 level does not seem to enhance patient outcomes. Finally, pending further trials of "symptomatic" participants, using sustained release LT3 to mimic normal physiology, and including monocarboxylate 10 transporter and Type 2 deiodinase polymorphisms and objective outcomes, I will continue to depend on therapy with LT4 monotherapy and seek alternative explanations for my patients' nonspecific symptoms.

### Hypothyroidism [^7fda9e7c]. Lancet (2017). Excellent credibility.

Hypothyroidism is a common condition of thyroid hormone deficiency, which is readily diagnosed and managed but potentially fatal in severe cases if untreated. The definition of hypothyroidism is based on statistical reference ranges of the relevant biochemical parameters and is increasingly a matter of debate. Clinical manifestations of hypothyroidism range from life threatening to no signs or symptoms. The most common symptoms in adults are fatigue, lethargy, cold intolerance, weight gain, constipation, change in voice, and dry skin, but clinical presentation can differ with age and sex, among other factors. The standard treatment is thyroid hormone replacement therapy with levothyroxine. However, a substantial proportion of patients who reach biochemical treatment targets have persistent complaints. In this Seminar, we discuss the epidemiology, causes, and symptoms of hypothyroidism; summarise evidence on diagnosis, long-term risk, treatment, and management; and highlight future directions for research.

2.0 Criteria for Diagnosis

2.1 Biochemical criteria for use in the decision to initiate treatment in an infant with high TSH and/or low FT4 concentration

Recommendations

2.1.1 We recommend starting treatment immediately after baseline serum TSH and FT4 determination if DBS TSH concentration is ≥ 40 mU/L of whole blood. If DBS TSH concentration is < 40 mU/L of whole blood, the clinician may postpone treatment, pending the serum results, for 1–2 days (1|⊕⊕○).

2.1.2 We recommend starting treatment immediately if serum FT4 concentration is below the norm for age, regardless of TSH concentration (1|⊕⊕⊕).

2.1.3 We suggest that treatment should be started if venous TSH concentration is persistently > 20 mU/L, even if serum FT4 concentration is normal (2|⊕○○).

2.1.4 When venous TSH concentration is between 6 and 20 mU/L in a well baby with an FT4 concentration within the normal limits for age, we suggest diagnostic imaging to try to establish a definitive diagnosis (2|⊕○○). If TSH concentration remains high for more than 3 to 4 weeks, we suggest (in discussion with the family) either starting L-T 4 supplementation immediately and retesting, off treatment, at a later stage; or retesting 2 weeks later without treatment (2|⊕○○).

2.1.1–2.1.4 Evidence

L-T 4 treatment must be started immediately if venous FT 4 or TT4 levels are low, given the known adverse effect of untreated decompensated CH on somatic growth and neurodevelopment. Previous work has shown that the likelihood of decompensated hypothyroidism is high if DBS TSH values are above 40 mU/L, justifying immediate treatment if DBS TSH concentration is above this value. Given that the period between birth and the age of 3 years is a critical time for neurocognitive development, most clinicians would advocate treatment when TSH concentration is > 20 mU/L, carefully monitoring thyroid function to avoid overtreatment, and retesting after 3 years if the thyroid is normally located. Management remains a matter of debate for cases in which TSH concentrations are high, but to a lesser extent (6–20 mU/L), and FT4 levels are normal. The family should be informed that this is a "gray area" but that many clinicians would advise "playing safe" and treating during early childhood in this situation.

American Thyroid Association — acquired pediatric hypothyroidism and OHI are managed primarily with levothyroxine. "Autoimmune thyroiditis is the most common cause of acquired hypothyroidism; it is more common in females compared to males, and the incidence increases during adolescence". Severe cases may present with "TSH values > 1000 mIU/L". For OHI, "LT4 replacement therapy is the treatment of choice for patients with OHI with the dose adjusted for weight or body surface area", using age bands where "The LT4 dose for patients 1–3 years of age is 4–6 μg/kg/d, for patients 3–10 years the LT4 dose is 3–5 μg/kg/d, and for patients 10–16 years the LT4 dose is 2–4 μg/kg/d", and "LT4 may also be dosed based on body surface area calculated at 100 μg/m²/d". Expectations should be realistic because "Reduction in pretreatment weight should not be presumed with initiation of LT4 replacement therapy".

Background

Hypothyroidism has multiple etiologies and manifestations. Appropriate treatment requires an accurate diagnosis and is influenced by coexisting medical conditions. This paper describes evidence-based clinical guidelines for the clinical management of hypothyroidism in ambulatory patients.

Methods

The development of these guidelines was commissioned by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) in association with American Thyroid Association (ATA). AACE and the ATA assembled a task force of expert clinicians who authored this article. The authors examined relevant literature and took an evidence-based medicine approach that incorporated their knowledge and experience to develop a series of specific recommendations and the rationale for these recommendations. The strength of the recommendations and the quality of evidence supporting each was rated according to the approach outlined in the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists Protocol for Standardized Production of Clinical Guidelines-2010 update.

Results

Topics addressed include the etiology, epidemiology, clinical and laboratory evaluation, management, and consequences of hypothyroidism. Screening, treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism, pregnancy, and areas for future research are also covered.

Conclusions

Fifty-two evidence-based recommendations and subrecommendations were developed to aid in the care of patients with hypothyroidism and to share what the authors believe is current, rational, and optimal medical practice for the diagnosis and care of hypothyroidism. A serum thyrotropin is the single best screening test for primary thyroid dysfunction for the vast majority of outpatient clinical situations. The standard treatment is replacement with L-thyroxine. The decision to treat subclinical hypothyroidism when the serum thyrotropin is less than 10 mIU/L should be tailored to the individual patient.

### The ages and TSH values of patients being prescribed levothyroxine [^c2c3fbb6]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hypothyroidism affects approximately 5% of the United States population, and synthetic thyroxine in the form of levothyroxine (LT4) is the most prescribed therapy for this common condition. Autoimmune hypothyroidism is generally progressive, with a decrement in endogenous thyroid function occurring over time, such that overt hypothyroidism would occur if the thyroid hormone deficiency is untreated. However, at the current time hypothyroidism may initially be diagnosed when it is mild or subclinical, at a time that the serum thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) is minimally elevated below 10 mIU/L and the serum thyroid hormone levels are normal. Symptoms of hypothyroidism are not always specific for this condition, and each of the symptoms generally associated with hypothyroidism may also have non-thyroid causes. As attribution of the cause of symptoms is not a simple matter, many physicians may err on the side of treating mild TSH elevations with the expectation that symptoms may improve. Thus, treatment with LT4 may be initiated for borderline TSH elevations. The authors also hypothesize that LT4 may even be prescribed for unconfirmed serum TSH elevations, or even without TSH elevation, based on the symptoms that the patient is experiencing.

LT4 is being prescribed with increasing frequency, both in the United States, and in other countries. Several studies have shown that the TSH threshold at which LT4 therapy is initiated has fallen over time, such that an increasing number of cases of subclinical hypothyroidism are being treated and the mean or median TSH value at which therapy is initiated has decreased over time.– This trend for increasing treatment and decreasing thresholds has been documented both in the United States, and in Europe. Moreover, a recent study showed that if LT4 therapy was discontinued in patients undergoing treatment, while 39% of patients did in fact become hypothyroid as manifest by an elevated TSH, 61% maintained a normal TSH, perhaps suggesting that their treatment was unnecessary. However, the follow-up period in this study was relatively brief at 6–8 weeks, thus hypothyroidism being manifest later during follow-up cannot be excluded. Although national databases show a trend for an increasing number of LT4 prescriptions being provided over time, part of this apparent increase may be accounted for by a reduction in the length of prescriptions by prescribers, such that more prescriptions are being generated for the same number of patients each year.

### Time for a reassessment of the treatment of hypothyroidism [^6a7a3b3f]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2019). Medium credibility.

Despite a historically late start in its recognition as a disease entity, hypothyroidism has remarkably become one of the most frequently diagnosed diseases in the Western world, and levothyroxine one of the most frequently used drugs worldwide.

How could a condition that had been overlooked throughout the centuries of human culture rise to such prominence in such a short time period? Clearly, this was related to the convenient and sensitive measurement of serum TSH, which has achieved a pre-eminent position in defining primary hypothyroidism. Consequently, a new disease class of subclinical hypothyroidism was introduced, which is solely based on the presence of an elevated TSH while the thyroid hormones FT3 and FT4 remain within their respective reference ranges. This strategy has not remained unchallenged and the deficiencies of this diagnostic approach have been reviewed elsewhere. In an attempt to scale back on the avalanche of purported thyroid diseases created by this strategy, the TSH threshold for treatment was raised in recent guidelines. In doing so, another problem was created by dissociating the TSH-based diagnosis of the disease from the requirement of therapeutic intervention. However, doctors and patients find it incomprehensible that a thyroid condition labelled as a disease would not therefore require suitable intervention. This questions the practical value of designation and appropriateness of the current diagnostic entity of subclinical hypothyroidism.

### American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists medical guidelines for clinical practice for the evaluation and treatment of hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism [^ca9f6d0d]. Endocrine Practice (2004). Low credibility.

These clinical practice guidelines summarize the recommendations of the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists for the diagnostic evaluation of hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism and for treatment strategies in patients with these disorders. The sensitive thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH or thyrotropin) assay has become the single best screening test for hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism, and in most outpatient clinical situations, the serum TSH is the most sensitive test for detecting mild thyroid hormone excess or deficiency. Therapeutic options for patients with Graves' disease include thyroidectomy (rarely used now in the United States), antithyroid drugs (frequently associated with relapses), and radioactive iodine (currently the treatment of choice). In clinical hypothyroidism, the standard treatment is levothyroxine replacement, which must be tailored to the individual patient. Awareness of subclinical thyroid disease, which often remains undiagnosed, is emphasized, as is a system of care that incorporates regular follow-up surveillance by one physician as well as education and involvement of the patient.
